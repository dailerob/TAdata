{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Tae YooSenior Vice President, Corporate Affairs, CiscoIt\u0027s a startling pair of statistics: When women are able to earn an income, they typically reinvest 90 percent of it back into their families and communities. And, for every year a girl stays in school, her future earnings will increase exponentially.Comments (11)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027It\u0027s time to move on from philosophical debates over whether a woman\u0027s place is in the home or the workplace -- women have long been in both. The public conversation we must have now should be about how we can empower women to find their way into economic stability. Women make 70 percent of the America\u0027s consumer decisions and 80 percent of healthcare decisions. It doesn\u0027t make much economic sense for so many women to be making so little. According to this year\u0027s Shriver Report, 73 percent of Americans support equal pay for equal work. And 78 percent believe that the government should expand access to affordable, high-quality childcare. These are sound public policies that can go a long way toward lifting women and their families out of poverty. But we also need to look deeper into our best values and examine how the problems of family breakdown and the cultural pathologies of poverty keep women on the brink.CommentsRobert ScobleStartup Liaison for RackspaceGoogle Glass is doomed. Why do I say that? Because the tech press tells me so. Now that we got that out of the way, what have I learned in my eight months of wearing Glass?Comments (19)Kathleen ReardonProfessor, USC Marshall School; Author, \u0027The Secret Handshake\u0027 and \u0027Shadow Campus\u0027If you haven\u0027t had Stage 4 cancer -- or any of a host of challenging and often frightening illnesses -- then give us all a break and find another topic. Start a different trend. Leave the rest of us to getting on with things the best way we know how. The ConversationComments (20)Eric WaggonerChair, English department, West Virginia Wesleyan CollegeTo hell with you all for continuing to exploit the lax, poorly-enforced safety regulations here, so that you could do your business in the cheapest manner possible by shortcutting the health and quality of life not only of your workers, but of everybody who lives here.Comments (117)Manoj Jain, MD MPHPhysician and WriterWe don\u0027t think of flu as a life-threatening illness in otherwise healthy young or middle-age adults, yet it is. In a bad flu season, as many as 50,000 deaths may occur due to flu-related illnesses.Comments (24)David FontanaAssociate Professor of Law at George Washington University School of Law in Washington, D.C.The Jewish community in the United States has been changing, and who takes the court and the field has started to change in response. What passed for history in Ann Arbor last week might become a regular occurrence in the years to come.CommentsJulie ColeMother of six and co-founding VP, Mabel\u0027s LabelsSure, there are some days when I wonder what I\u0027ve gotten myself into, worry about the world they\u0027ll inherit and consider the environmental footprint of a family like mine. But most of the time, I just celebrate how awesome it is to have six kids.CommentsDr. Gail GrossHuman Behavior and Education Expert, Speaker, Author. Ph.D. Ed.D.I know that no two children have the same set of parents, even though they live in the same family. Why? Because parents are different with each of their children, and no two children ever take the same role.Comments (29)Katie HeaneyPeople have interesting reactions when you tell them you\u0027ve never had a boyfriend and you\u0027re over the age of 21. Most girls are pretty good at acting like they aren\u0027t shocked, because most of them have at least one friend who doesn\u0027t date as much as the others for whom they\u0027ve learned to be uncondescendingly empathetic.Comments (138)H. Alan ScottWriter, Comedian, Fresca enthusiastIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was, uh, well, just another day in the United States of Don\u0027t Get Sick Because You Won\u0027t Be Able to Afford It.CommentsMichelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesIn an interview with me at the 2008 RNC, Sally Kern repeated a line she\u0027d said before, that \"we\u0027re becoming so open-minded that our brains are falling out.\" Well, Kern\u0027s brain must be toppling all over the sidewalk, after a federal judge in Oklahoma ruled yesterday that the state\u0027s ban on gay marriage is unconstitutional.Comments (184)Bill GeorgeProfessor of Management Practice, Harvard Business SchoolAs an executive, you would never wish for a major crisis, but as I have learned in crises at other firms, they can make your company more effective and your organization more unified and committed to its True North in the long-run. Ultimately, I predict the same thing will happen at Target.CommentsMartha BurkMoney Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsObama said Congress should pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill that would outlaw the practice of prohibiting employees from discussing their pay with others, and also allow the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to collect some pay data by race and gender. But it\u0027s half a loaf at best.CommentsDennis PowersInternet technologistI am the new working poor. The \"better life\" that my parents worked so hard to make for me, that I worked so hard to improve, had come down to this decision: whether to purchase food for my belly or the medication to prevent another stroke.Comments (581)Rob ReinaldaWriter, 28 years in print journalismWords are everywhere, and many are strung together recklessly. People tend to pick up errant usages as easily as black velvet picks up lint. Next thing you know, someone sees that verbal atrocity as a viable expression, and the cycle continues.CommentsMark RippetoePowerlifter; Coach; Author, \u0027Starting Strength: Basic Barbell Training\u0027Once you set up a plan that continually increases your strength and your endurance, and that also controls your diet, you\u0027re Training, and your goal is now being prepared for, not wished for.CommentsRev. Chuck CurrieUnited Church of Christ ministerYou do not honor men killed by gun violence by putting more guns on the street. Instead you work to reduce gun violence and work to bring reconciliation to a fractured nation.Comments (46)Scott BennerStay-at-home dad and author, Life Is Short, Laundry Is Eternal: Confessions of a Stay-At-Home DadPeople do amazing things every day, things that look brave to onlookers who have yet to face such challenges. The uninitiated will refer to the actor\u0027s response as brave, but the people who fight the fight call it staying alive.CommentsTavis SmileyPBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorThe scion of a distinguished family of politicians, Dern talks about his early years growing up and why he chose acting as his career.CommentsKia MakarechiSenior Editor for Mobile and Innovations, The Huffington PostThe killing in Florida is not the first time select bloggers have placed their precious movie-going experience above human decency.Comments (72)Eric BoehlertSenior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaDespite the hundreds of hours Republican congressional committees have spent trying to ferret out Obama scandals, and the thousands of hours the right-wing media have devoted to that same goal since 2009, Christie\u0027s office last week produced the type of smoking-gun document that Obama\u0027s critics can still only dream about. But of course they\u0027ll keep dreaming.Comments (39)Alex KorchinskiEntrepreneur and growth marketerThe walk back to my apartment was long. I called my parents in tears and relived every misstep, looking entirely out of place in the midst of the morning hustle and bustle. But here I am one week later. It\u0027s possible that getting shit-canned was the best thing to happen to me in 2013.CommentsArt BrodskyCommunications consultant, proprietor of Continental Drive blogThe idea that those companies that run big telecommunications networks shouldn\u0027t be able to play favorites is dead, at age 80. First enacted in the 1934 Communications Act, the principle was very simple. Telephone companies shouldn\u0027t be able to discriminate among the traffic they carry. The U.S. Appeals Court for the D.C. Circuit ruling killed it.CommentsAdam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; co-founder of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911With a little extra work and some programming ingenuity, identity thieves can use your information to engage in what I like to call the pantheon of \"-ishing\" -- phishing, spear-phishing, vishing and smishing -- and still turn a tidy profit off of their crimes with your inadvertent help.CommentsJag DaviesPublications Manager, Drug Policy AllianceA medical marijuana victory at the ballot box in Florida would certainly be a breakthrough in the South, a breakthrough in one of the most populous states in the country, and a breakthrough in a bellwether state in American politics.CommentsSeth ShostakSenior Astronomer, SETI InstituteHarold Camping, the president of evangelical Family Radio, predicted that the world would end in 2011. Twice. Being fair about this, could you say that, by definition, Camping was doing a science experiment?CommentsCraig AaronPresident and CEO, Free PressThe big news: A federal appeals court on Tuesday struck down the Federal Communications Commission\u0027s Open Internet Order. It didn\u0027t have to be this way.Comments (95)Rev. Dr. Susan Brooks ThistlethwaiteProfessor of Theology, Chicago Theological SeminaryThe Iran Sanctions Bill is unwise from a policy perspective, as it is a \"threat to the talks\" at a delicate stage. But even worse, perhaps, it is a profoundly immoral bill as it plays politics with the nuclear threat.CommentsEddie ParsonsStyle ConsultantThe end of summer brought the public declaration that I was going to open myself up to dog ownership and curious minds asked a ton of unsolicited questions.CommentsJeff JarvisAuthor, \u0027Public Parts\u0027 and \u0027What Would Google Do?\u0027Imagine a world in which there is no stigma about illness, in which ailments are not a matter of privacy or lost insurance or jobs, in which we collectively share and learn as much as we can about what afflicts us so it can afflict fewer. It\u0027s just data.CommentsBen IrwinAuthor, bloggerGood people will disagree on the best ways to mitigate and perhaps even eradicate poverty. But one thing is clear, at least for those of us who claim the Bible as some kind of authority: apathy in the face of poverty is not an option.CommentsAaron Rhodes, 2014.15.01Melissa Burkley, Ph.D., 2014.15.01Ted Devine, 2014.15.01Madhusree Mukerjee, 2014.15.01Christian Föllmann, 2014.15.01Sam Tracy, 2014.15.01Suzanne Grimes, 2014.15.01Kevin Walsh, 2014.15.01Lindsay Hill, 2014.15.01Sunil Adam, 2014.15.01Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"AFGHAN \u0027NARCO-CRIMINAL STATE\u0027",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BizYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
