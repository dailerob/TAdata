{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior writer, BillMoyers.com. Former senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.Gather round for the word of the day: metanarrative. Definitions vary but let\u0027s say it\u0027s one big narrative that connects the meaning of events to a belief thought to be an essential truth, the storytelling equivalent of the unified field theory in physics. Now use it to define what\u0027s being done to America today. The Koch brothers and the extraordinary machine they have built in cahoots with fellow billionaires and others, have spent hundreds and hundreds of millions to get their way, all part of one long story told in pursuit of a specific end: to make the needs of the very, very few our nation\u0027s top priority and to thwart or destroy any group effort among the poor and middle class to do or say otherwise.It\u0027s 2016, and while England, Germany, Denmark, Chile, Argentina, India and even Pakistan have elected women heads of state, we still haven\u0027t even nominated a woman for our highest office. With Hillary Clinton, we have a female candidate who not only has a stronger resume than that of any of her rivals in either party, but who is firmly committed ensuring equal pay for women, and who has been uniquely outspoken on the impact that women have on the economy.CEO, The Creative Class Group \u0026 Best-Selling Author, UpgradeDonald Trump, who has been running for president since July, is a fictional character, and we really don\u0027t know what the real Donald Trump would do if he was elected president. As entertainment became his primary business, Trump started playing a character named Donald Trump, a bombastic real estate mogul who is a walking symbol of opulence and a modern, garish appropriation of the notion of class.Writer and ProfessorWe cannot simply call out the dirty tricks, we must mobilize to confront proponents of voter suppression head-on. To keep rising, we need to convert the mass outrage fueled by voter suppression not just into voter turnout but into mass strategic action that\u0027s outcomes-driven and focused on political accountability and legislative change.Executive Director, ColorOfChangeI love Scrabble and play it daily as a release from politics and law. As the race for Barack Obama\u0027s successor heats up, herewith three lessons from Scrabble for politics: knowledge, vision, and flexibility.Chair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusAs a white woman, Beyonce\u0027s video and subsequent Superbowl performance is like my sister having a really amazing party that I get to go to. The Beyonce performances of Formation are not our party. We are there, we get to be at the party. But we can\u0027t be blowing out the candles and expecting people to sing to us.Blogs at Accidental Devotional and is the author of Consent Based ParentingWe want Bernie, because he is not fueled by an egotist\u0027s dream of presidency. He is real. He is fueled by the issues of people who need help. Bernie is not running for the presidency. He is running for the people who are not getting the voice they deserve.High School Student.Fan of classic rock, skiing, and politics.I\u0027ve deluded myself that there was a line that couldn\u0027t be crossed, and that Donald Trump, the most odious specimen of humanity I have ever experienced in American public life -- not that he hasn\u0027t had plenty of competition -- was on the other side of that line. As the results from New Hampshire clearly prove, I\u0027ve been an idiot.Paul Slansky is amassing a memory for Americans allergic to accountability and addicted to amnesia.Last night, New Hampshire shook up the presidential race and roiled what were already less-than-calm waters, in both the Democratic Party and the GOP. On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton looks a lot weaker than she did a few weeks ago.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comLike many others, I am hoping that what we learn from these drugs might open new pathways to treat some very disabling mental and additive conditions, enable some of us to quiet our fears when ill with cancer or close to passing, and possibly add a touch more creativity and flexibility to our world.Medical editor, mental health for The Huffington PostWhen it comes to American Muslims, our nation\u0027s actions often do not match the principles of equal treatment and religious freedom enshrined in our Constitution. I do not lose hope, though. A key source of inspiration comes from American Muslim communities and allies themselves.Director, ACLU’s National Security ProjectLONDON -- Humanity is everybody\u0027s business, and an education is everybody\u0027s right. So it shouldn\u0027t fall only to governments and international agencies to provide aid during a crisis. Inside the humanitarian tent we need charities, philanthropists, businesses and social enterprises all working together.Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationIt\u0027s almost hard to imagine a campaign finance landscape more broken than the one we currently have, but Jeb! has done it. As MSNBC\u0027s Steve Benen points out, his vision seems to rest on the question: Why have donors give millions to outside groups like super PACs, when you can have those millions just go straight to the candidates?President, People For the American WayThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will hopefully galvanize unprecedented global collaboration for improving the lives of billions of people in the 21st century.Public Health Editor, The Huffington Post; Former U.S. Assistant Surgeon GeneralSeth Williams has gone from playing the blues on Market Street in Madison, North Carolina, to the famed Beale Street in Memphis. Welcome to the home of the blues.Entertainment WriterGender, race, economic justice, transphobia and homophobia matter in the United States today, and Hillary Clinton\u0027s proud history of fighting for all of us give her knowledge, insights, and wisdom that others do not have.President, National Organization for WomenYes, some 50 percent of voters say they wouldn\u0027t vote for a socialist; but a lot of those are people who haven\u0027t thought about the word since the 1970s. We should take this profession of hostility less seriously.Professor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027Sometime during Casabourblanca, a signature event of the second Kentucky Bourbon Affair last year, my wife — who was celebrating her 50th birthday — sidled up to legendary distiller Jimmy Russell to introduce herself and to tell him thanks for being a part of the best party ever.Father of twins, journalist, writer, lover of bourbon, wine and great beerI woke up in a mild panic last Saturday morning. I had a long day of social events ahead of me and seemingly endless work to do on Sunday. The problem: How could I party all day and not wake up with a horrible hangover?Deputy blog editor, The Huffington PostThe case for Hillary Clinton is mostly a matter of rebutting the case against her. Once that\u0027s done, you\u0027re simply left with the most qualified candidate, and someone who is, by all reality-based measures, progressive. And just as important, someone who is capable of achieving results.Currently earning MFA in Creative Writing at The Ohio State UniversityAbout a year ago in a column, I called out ESPN radio host Mike Golic for his on-air suggestions that football is as safe as it\u0027s ever been and for his unwavering support of \"Heads Up.\" Sunday morning, I called him out again.Former New York Press Association Writer of the YearOn this tragic day, the heavens screamed as three angels were killed. But on this very same day, a legacy was born. Here are 10 things we can learn from Deah Barakat, Yusor Abu-Salha, and Razan Abu-Salha, in the words of their closest friends.Palestinian-American Muslim. Student. Humanitarian.CARACAS, Venezuela -- The people of Venezuela are fighting the impunity and the oppression of the Maduro regime, but it is not a fight we can win on our own. We ask that all countries that value freedom, democracy and human dignity stand with us.Venezuelan human rights activistSabeti\u0027s statistical research in the medical field and her recent work with Ebola is being celebrated not only in the field of medicine but also in entertainment since her pop group Thousand Days explores such topics from the creative perspective.Trafficbeat Entertainment, Music Biz VetDonald Trump\u0027s decisive win in the New Hampshire Primary may have put the final nail in the coffin of conventional and establishment theories on presidential campaigning in the United States, as a new paradigm has arisen. Its author is Donald J. Trump.Founder, GlobalEconomicCrisis.comI think that the Sanders campaign might represent a positive shift for the discussion of certain topics within the Democratic Party. However, for all the positive things his campaign represents, it also represents something deeply problematic: a fetishization of not knowing.PhD Candidate in Political Science at Brown UniversityUnder the Obama administration, U.S. policy toward North Korea largely has devolved into the president sitting in the Oval Office, closing his eyes, and hoping the nuclear monsters will go away. Alas, it hasn\u0027t worked.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteDespite the mounting evidence of widespread torture, jailings of tens of thousands of political detainees, and \"disappearings\" of non-violent government critics and human rights defenders, Kerry made no reference to human rights violations in his remarks welcoming Minister Shoukry to Washington.International Policy Adviser for Human Rights FirstDonald Trump won last night\u0027s New Hampshire primary by as much as 20 points. Yet Gallup\u0027s Frank Newport has noted that Trump would be the least popular major-party nominee in that firm\u0027s long history of tracking such data. Some analysts have focused on these and similar poll numbers to highlight Trump\u0027s vulnerabilities.Pollster and political analystThe dangerous water consumed by residents of Flint, MI is the canary in the coal mine of our nation\u0027s crumbling infrastructure. Poisoned water endangers the health or millions of Americans, especially children, and jeopardizes state and national economic vibrancy.Former Congressman and Secretary of Agriculture and a Senior Fellow at the Bipartisan Policy InstituteBRISTOL, England -- America\u0027s rise of political outsiders mirrors the growth of populist parties on the old continent: Syriza and Golden Dawn in Greece, Podemos in Spain, the Austrian Freedom Party, the Five Star movement in Italy: the list goes on and on. In response, a balancing act needs to be pulled off, acknowledging what populism identifies correctly as deep problems in our politics while resisting the often conspiratorial details and simplistic, unworkable solutions.Founding editor, The Philosophers’ MagazineGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
