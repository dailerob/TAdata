{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"The media world\u0027s fetishization of social media has reached idol-worshipping proportions. Our media culture is locked in the Perpetual Now, constantly chasing ephemeral scoops that last only seconds and that most often don\u0027t matter in the first place, even for the brief moment that they\u0027re \"exclusive.\" \"We are in great haste,\" wrote Thoreau in 1854, \"to construct a magnetic telegraph from Maine to Texas; but Maine and Texas, it may be, have nothing important to communicate.\" And today, we are in great haste to celebrate something going viral, but seem completely unconcerned whether the thing that went viral added one iota of anything good -- including just simple amusement -- to our lives. So the question remains: as we adopt new and better ways to help people communicate, can we keep asking what is really being communicated?Read Post | Comments (15)Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, 03/08/12U.S. Senator from New YorkI can\u0027t think of a better way to celebrate International Women\u0027s Day than to pick up Half The Sky, be inspired by the women profiled in the book and take action for all the women and girls around the world who aren\u0027t yet empowered to do so for themselves.Read Post | Comments (14)Dan Froomkin, 03/08/12Senior Washington Correspondent, Huffington PostAs the economic and social costs of mass incarceration mount, many criminal justice professionals and officials are now calling on the U.S. to abandon these policies and replace them with more constructive approaches.Read Post | Comments (77)Robert Scheer, 03/08/12Editor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027He has been a national symbol of resistance to excessive government power and waste. He has been a champion of social justice. His has been a rare voice, and one way or another it must continue to be heard. When it came to the struggle for peace over war, Dennis was the conscience of the Congress.Read Post | Comments (61)Bill McKibben, 03/08/12Author of a dozen books, including \u0027The End of Nature\u0027 and \u0027Deep Economy\u0027A year ago almost no one had heard of the pipeline. Even four months ago, a poll of 300 \"energy insiders\" still found 97 percent predicting it would get its permit. But it didn\u0027t -- TransCanada can of course re-apply, but that will be another battle, down the road.Read Post | Comments (23)Sen. Chris Coons, 03/08/12U.S. Senator from DelawareLet\u0027s harness the power of the massive groundswell of interest created online this week and use it to do the right thing: support the Obama Administration\u0027s decision to deploy military advisors and do everything in our power to ensure their mission succeeds.Read Post | CommentsTony Blair, 03/08/12Former Prime Minister of BritainThe women who have inspired me most recently are the Catholic Sisters who are dealing with sexual trafficking.

I don\u0027t deny there are damaged women out there who use abortion as a means of birth control. A former friend had five abortions. Those pregnancies were her cry for help. But I can\u0027t help thinking those babies were better off not being in her care.Read Post | Comments (96)Ahmed Shihab-Eldin, 03/08/12Host/Producer, HuffPost Streaming NetworkIn an election year beset by economic and geopolitical turmoil, it would serve Obama well to remind the world of the two very words that landed him in the White House. Give us \"hope\" and act boldly, and in doing so, bring about real \"change\" in Syria.Read Post | Comments (49)Michael Tucker, 03/08/12FilmmakerWhen I first heard that the Weinstein Company had lost its appeal to overturn the R rating that the MPAA had given to Lee Hirsch\u0027s film Bully, I was taken back to 2005 when we opted for an appeal for our Iraq War film Gunner Palace after it also received an R for language.Read Post | CommentsAyesha Mattu and Nura Maznavi, 03/08/12As Muslim women born and raised in America, we are tired of hearing everyone talk about Muslim women without ever stopping to listen to what we have to say about our lives.Read Post | CommentsCara Santa Maria, 03/07/12Science correspondent, Huffington Post; editor, Talk Nerdy to MeRush Limbaugh made some comments this past week that raised more than a few eyebrows.

When the Ellen Show called \"I thought \u0027there\u0027s no way that Sophia will walk out there and perform\u0027,\" her father says. \"But then they also asked for Rosie, and I knew that would make her more confident.\"Read Post | Comments (11)Sec. Kathleen Sebelius, 03/08/12Secretary of Health and Human ServicesOver the last three years, we\u0027ve made significant strides in our fight against tobacco, and our efforts are paying off.

Pappas, 03/08/12President, The Pappas Group; Publisher, Greek America Magazine; Founder, Greek America FoundationGreece may not presently be one of our \"cool\" friends at the moment in light of all of its problems -- but as a nation, we would be turning our back on our own ideals if we forgot her loyalty to the United States.Read Post | CommentsDavid Isenberg, 03/08/12Author, \u0027Shadow Force: Private Security Contractors in Iraq\u0027Given that some of the people the Koch brothers want to put on CATO\u0027s board are firmly in the neocon camp, one doesn\u0027t have to be a rocket scientist to see that a Koch-controlled CATO Institute is one big win for unbridled militarism and one big setback for those advocating small government and individual liberty.Read Post | Comments (16)Hilde Johnson, 03/08/12Special Representative of the U.N. Secretary-General in South SudanSouth Sudan is the world\u0027s newest nation, and while we celebrate the first International Women\u0027s Day in independent South Sudan, we must look at how we can address the great challenges faced by women and girls in one of the world\u0027s least developed countries.Read Post | CommentsJincey Lumpkin, 03/08/12Founder and Chief Sexy Officer, Juicy Pink BoxI\u0027ve written about how the pressure to live up to my mother\u0027s expectations led me to struggle with suicide after I came out.
