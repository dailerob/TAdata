{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week was dominated by the ongoing Congressional hostage drama. Democrats trumpeted a poll showing more Americans blame the GOP (53 percent) than Obama (31 percent) -- with the GOP garnering a record low approval rating. But while the White House may be winning the battle, it\u0027s the country that continues to lose the war. With 7.3 percent unemployment, and 20 million people unemployed or underemployed, the fact that all notions of \"compromise\" are taken only to mean some mix of further self-destructive cuts -- instead of investing in infrastructure building and a real jobs program -- shows just how far the economic debate has been shut down. At some point, this manufactured crisis will end, but it will take a lot more than getting back to the status quo to release the true hostages: the poor, the middle class and the American Dream.Comments (151)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundExtremist Republicans continue to hold funding for the federal government hostage for the second week in a row, opposing a clean extension of government funding without conditions. Their actions are harming the economy and countless real children and families across the country.Comments (294)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027We\u0027re hearing lots of babble at the Capitol, but across the street, we\u0027re trying to hear the word of God -- what God says about the people, families, and children who will suffer the most because of Washington\u0027s babble.Comments (50)Arianna HuffingtonGreetings from Germany! I\u0027m in Munich for the launch of The Huffington Post Deutschland. We will be relentlessly covering politics and news at a very fascinating moment in German history.Comments (216)Niall FergusonLaurence A. Tisch Professor of History at Harvard University; Senior Fellow of the Hoover Institution, Stanford UniversityI would like to see Paul Krugman admit that he got the biggest call of the last several years dead wrong, again and again and again. Not only should he admit his mistake, but he should also apologize to the millions of people who have suffered as a result of it.Comments (1,607)Sebastian MatthesEditor in Chief, HuffPost DeutschlandThe Huffington Post sees itself as a platform where readers, experts and journalists discuss, argue and promote important issues of our time. We believe that the time for this has arrived. We want to continue this story in Germany -- and accompany the debates of our time in new waysCommentsBarbra StreisandSinger; Actress; Director; Composer; ActivistAs we now enter the third week of the unnecessary government shutdown, Americans should remember the words of GOP Representative Martin Stutzman, \"We\u0027re not going to be disrespected. We have to get something out of this. And I don\u0027t know what that even is.\"Comments (973)Dylan RatiganNew York Times Best-Selling author, entrepreneur and formerly the host of MSNBC\u0027s The Dylan Ratigan ShowI have always believed that the size of the problem equals the size of the opportunity. And considering the obvious size of the problem presented by opaque election financing and extractive core systems, massive opportunities for reform surely surround us.Comments (81)Alicia KeysSinger, songwriter, AIDS activist, philanthropistThe crazy decision to shut down the government is causing real pain and anxiety to our most vulnerable -- single mothers and children. At its core, the shutdown seems to be about whether or not we value a society that shares its burdens.Comments (63)Barry LevinsonAcademy Award-winning director, screenwriter and producerWe might get past the debt ceiling crisis, the government shutdown, but the future of America is clear. We are no longer the wonder of the world. We exposed our ignorance, our ugly insensitivity. We are a petty people with a government that has ceased to function.Comments (390)Christy Turlington BurnsFounder, Every Mother Counts, Director/Producer, NO WOMAN, NO CRY, global maternal health advocate, mom, modelIt\u0027s time to make a radical shift, to start seeing girls not as vulnerable or as a liability, but as potential leaders. It\u0027s time to see girls for who they are: the driving force of their generation, one poised to bring real social change.CommentsKirk DouglasActorI had a stroke about 15 years ago. I lost my voice. Now what does an actor do who loses his voice -- give up? No, he waits for silent pictures to come back. I can joke about it now, but it wasn\u0027t funny then.Comments (58)Nicolas BerggruenFounder and chairman, Berggruen HoldingsThough the combined votes of the SPD, the Greens and the Left were greater than the votes for the CDU and its allies in the recent election, Angela Merkel for all intents and purposes has been given a mandate to continue her European policy that prioritizes austerity.Comments (83)Muhammad YunusNobel Peace Prize winner; founder, Grameen Bank; chairman, Yunus Social BusinessI have always said that human beings are multidimensional beings. Their happiness comes from many sources, not as our current economic framework assumes, just from making money.CommentsCarole KingSinger, songwriter and environmental activistI don\u0027t understand how men and women who want the best for their children and grandchildren can be so blind to the consequences of their actions. There is nowhere to hide from global warming.Comments (344)Desmond Tutu1984 Nobel Peace Prize winnerWe need each other\u0027s magnificence to be fully human. I need, and the world needs, you to be the unique and wonderful gift that you are. You are made for goodness and to be a person of peace. This is true for you and for every single human being on the planet. So join us on the Ubuntu Train and be part of the movement for peace within, among and between people.CommentsSteve ClemonsEditor at Large of The Atlantic and founder and senior fellow of the American Strategy Program at the New America Foundation.While Hagel clearly has his views of the world informed in part by a lifetime as a card-carrying Republican, he has shown himself to be the \u0027quiet do-er,\u0027 just getting things done.CommentsDiane RavitchHistorian, NYU professorInstead of developing a democratic process in which teachers, scholars and specialists were consulted at every step in the process -- instead of trying out the standards to see how they work in real classrooms -- the Gates Foundation and the Department of Education took a shortcut.Comments (173)Adrian Grenier and Peter GlatzerAt SHFT, we find it pretty astonishing that in our world of unprecedented access to information, science and technology well over 100 members of the United States Congress are climate change deniers.Comments (203)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistWhether they\u0027re childhood friends, neighborhood friends, family friends, girlfriends, boyfriends (or even boyfriends who eventually became boy friends, if you know what I mean), life wouldn\u0027t be half as much fun -- or as meaningful -- without the company of those who know what makes us tick (and vice versa).Comments (12)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkBlacks, Latinos, Native Americans, Asians, women, gays and other marginalized groups have fought long and hard to level the playing field and bring about change. While we have many more challenges ahead of us, we have made tremendous gains.Comments (77)Alissa ParkerBlogger, TheParkerFive and co-founder, safeandsoundschools.orgI miss Em a lot lately. I miss everything about her sweet, beautiful face smiling up at me. There are days when my face, I am sure, looks a lot like Emilie\u0027s did the day we let her butterflies go.Comments (325)Marty KaplanDirector, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolWhat about today\u0027s texting toddlers who grow up thinking that lol is a word? Are we raising a generation of illiterates whose fuzzy spelling is the precursor of fuzzy thinking?Comments (65)Hannah BrencherWriter, Millennial Communications Expert, Founder of MoreLoveLetters.comLife is a steep, uphill battle but it\u0027s fierce and it\u0027s beautiful and you\u0027ll be sad to see it go if you live it right.Comments (182)Sen. Jay RockefellerU.S. Senator, West VirginiaIf my colleagues won\u0027t listen to my arguments for why we must not delay and vote to raise the debt ceiling, I do hope they listen to President Reagan.Comments (160)Tamara StarLife Coach, Speaker, WriterI\u0027m told happiness is a choice. Unfortunately we complicate our lives to the point of being unable to recognize happiness when it appears before our eyes.Comments (128)Bill MoyersManaging Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyAs the government shutdown continues, the Supreme Court began its new term this week and justices heard arguments in McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission. The case has been billed as the successor to the court\u0027s Citizens United decision.Comments (28)TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"New York Times personal tech columnist David Pogue shares ten easy shortcuts that cut down on the time it takes to compose a text message, fill out an online form, and complete other everyday tasks.Comments (100)Paul PolmanCEO, UnileverWhen people talk about new forms of capitalism, this is what I have in mind: companies that show, in all transparency, that they are contributing to society, now and for many generations to come. Not taking from it.Comments (77)Gov. Deval PatrickGovernor, MassachusettsAccessible, affordable, quality care in all cases improves lives and in many cases saves lives. It gives peace of mind and economic security to families. It increases productivity for large and small employers as well as for students. It creates jobs and contributes to our economic strength. It\u0027s a powerful statement of who we are.Comments (527)Jenny Dewey RohrichPhotographer, blogger, country girlThere is no denying the fact that our relationship is an adventure. Being married is a feat in and of itself -- being married to a farmer adds a whole other layer.Comments (183)Bruce Wilson, 2013.13.10Dogster, 2013.13.10Anca Dumitru, 2013.13.10Tom Krattenmaker, 2013.13.10Dave Helfert, 2013.13.10Jeff Danziger, 2013.13.10Oliver Tearle, 2013.13.10Alexandra Molotkow, 2013.13.10Dr. Charles G.
