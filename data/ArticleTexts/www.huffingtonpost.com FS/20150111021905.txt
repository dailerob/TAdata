{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Children\u0027s Defense FundFor many, the start of a new year is a chance to turn over a new leaf and take a hard look at the gap between who we say want and need to be and who we are. As a nation it’s time to close our hypocrisy gap in the treatment of our children and value and protect our children — all of them. We need to examine with urgency how we treat our children and the gap between what we say and what we do. Why do we choose to let children be the poorest age group in our rich nation and stand by as millions of children suffer preventable poverty, hunger, homelessness, sickness, neglect, abuse, miseducation, and violence? It’s time to realize the promise of a fair playing field for all children. We can and must do better.Since September 11, Americans in particular -- though not only -- have supported politicians and opinion-mongers in pivoting their geo-politics and world views on isolated, spectacular, terrible acts by terrible people.Professor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027Let us remember the journalists, police and other brave souls who were killed by those who could not abide difference and challenge without resorting to murder.

By the time you read this, there is a roughly 25 percent chance that you have given up. Already. After nine days.Senior Financial Writer, The Huffington PostGiven this, it is imperative that we put aside fantasies about any side winning or, worse still, the notion that should they win peace and justice and democracy will reign over the land. The Syria of old is forever gone and a democracy will not easily emerge from the breakdown of the old order.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027This isn\u0027t just a battle over industry influence. This is a choice about the kind of nation we want to live in. Do we want to live in a country where expert reviews don\u0027t matter and industry profits trump our families\u0027 health? Or do we want something better?Actor, director and environmental activistLittle brothers aren\u0027t supposed to die. This is something you know as a child without someone telling you.

Sometimes funny fat girl at parties.A small, poor nation, the Democratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea should be an international nullity, irrelevant to global affairs.

Our team will continue to work on the issues in the communities that need our help the most.President and CEO of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)While we\u0027ve heard pro-fracking propaganda before from the Obama administration, many Americans have had enough of it and I\u0027m one of them. In 2008, I voted for \u0027Hope and Change,\u0027 but we are not getting the change we hoped for.Oscar-nominated actor, climate change activistThis isn\u0027t a story about regret or failure. I raise my voice because I do a lot as a parent, because there\u0027s a lot going on. We all have a lot going on. And kids don\u0027t listen all the time, nor should they be expected to.Father of two and blogger at PuzzlingPosts.comIt might be hard to believe today, but in the eight years or so that preceded the day when gunmen went into its office, calling, \"Where\u0027s Charb? Where\u0027s Charb?\" before indiscriminately killing the editor and several staffers, I had thought of Charlie Hebdo with some envy. The staffers had gone to court and won their cases; two of France\u0027s premiers had backed them on the right to continue being offensive in the same decade when we in India had lost the right to offend. They had been able to exercise a freedom that many Indians had not been able to claim.Author and literary columnistWe are two American religious communities in such pain from the outburst of extremist violence in France that we not only have forgotten each other. We have forgotten ourselves.Rabbi, Millennial, Interfaith LeaderSo there you have it. If you like bone broth, sip bone broth -- although I do think you are obliged to consider the lives, and deaths, that spawned those bones.

I know your house is a mess. I know you have writer\u0027s block. I know you feel behind. I know you wish you were superwoman. I know. I know. But. You just had a baby.Writer + photographerThe attack in Paris has presented a much more important problem -- while we continue to discuss the nature of this ongoing conflict, the conflict has come to us. And it has found us unprepared.L\u0027Huffington Post Editorial DirectorThere\u0027s plenty of real estate for extraterrestrial life, right? Well, maybe not.Senior Astronomer, SETI InstituteThough this attack happened in France, there are few things considered to be more American than our right to our freedom of speech. By contrast there should be few things less patriotic than skulking away with our tail between our legs when someone threatens that freedom.Author of \"A Fearless Voice\", Media Strategist and Political CorrespondentThe world would not be the same without them. I think we should focus on understanding and supporting these people rather than ostracizing and mocking them.\" That said, here are some of the best films dealing with Asperger\u0027sCo-editor, The Hollywood Interview.comCan relationships based on infidelity last?A community of experts, bloggers and \"divorced moms\"Up until last year, insurance companies could -- and often did -- charge women different premiums than men for the same coverage. As of January 1, 2014, the ACA prohibits this gender discrimination.Senior Advisor to the President and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsTo believe that the attack in Paris was a tragedy singularly about a cartoon or as an event solely to be defined as an assault on freedom of expression, is to be daft and incongruent with the history and reality of American and Western policy in the Middle East.Senior Fellow, Center for International Policy; MatthewHoh.comSupplements can be a great gap-filler for those who find it impossible to eat a balanced diet or have certain medical conditions, but the best option for both cancer patients and healthy individuals is a diet full of fresh fruits and vegetables.Integrative medical doctorJe suis Charlie Hebdo.
