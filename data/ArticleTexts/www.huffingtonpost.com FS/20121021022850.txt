{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"We didn\u0027t need the Long Island Medium to predict that the Sleepy-Time Obama from the Debacle in Denver would be replaced at this week\u0027s Hofstra debate with a much feistier POTUS -- or that the town hall format would lead to more verbal sparring than the locked-behind-a-podium approach. The breakout star of the event was Romney\u0027s \"binders full of women\" comment, an awkward turn of phrase that unleashed a bevy of tweets, Tumblr gifs, and video mashups. The top TiVo takeaway had to be Romney\u0027s epic fail as, eyebrows shooting upward, he tried to nail Obama on the words the president had used to describe the attack in Benghazi -- a dramatic moment highlighted by Candy Crowley\u0027s instant fact-check. Before the debate, I suggested that the real-time, crowd-sourced fact checking that has become a staple on Twitter should be made a standard part of the debate process. Candy\u0027s sharp memory demonstrated why it\u0027d be so useful.Read Post | Comments (14)Gordon Brown, 10/15/12Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationMalala\u0027s plight has unleashed an unprecedented outpouring of public support. Now all of us must make that support count -- and deliver on the cause she has been fighting for -- her dream of education for every child.Read Post | Comments (118)Robert Redford, 10/19/12Actor, director, and environmental activistWe simply can\u0027t let Mitt Romney buy the keys to the White House and let the special interests write our nation\u0027s energy plan behind closed doors. He\u0027d roll back every step of progress we\u0027ve made -- not just in the last four years, but the last 40 years.Read Post | Comments (1,639)Arianna Huffington, 10/16/12It\u0027s fun to see how a candidate responds to a zinger, but it\u0027d be much more instructive to see how a candidate goes about seeking information that he doesn\u0027t know.Read Post | Comments (357)Cesar Millan, 10/15/12Dog Whisperer and CEO of CesarsWay.comIf we could hold a debate with dogs as the audience, we\u0027d learn a lot about the candidates. Dogs have had thousands of years of evolution, studying the faces, body language, and scent of the humans they travel with.Read Post | Comments (183)Daniel Ellsberg, 10/18/12Former American military analyst who sparked a national uproar in 1971.I don\u0027t \u0027support Obama.\u0027 I oppose the current Republican Party. The only way for progressives and Democrats to block Romney from office, at this date, is to persuade enough people in swing states to vote for Obama: not stay home, or vote for someone else.Read Post | Comments (910)Elizabeth H. Bradley and Lauren Taylor, 10/20/12Although rarely included in the public discourse regarding health reform, stories like James Holmes\u0027 reflect the ways in which our faltering health care system is even more problematic when it comes to mental health.Read Post | Comments (46)Marlo Thomas, 10/18/12Award-winning actress, author, and activistIf you are a parent, I just want to ask you for five minutes. I think that\u0027s all it should take to make you think differently about bullying, an issue most of us don\u0027t spend a lot of time on, but should.Read Post | Comments (160)Russell Simmons, 10/17/12Founder, GlobalGrind.comWe have allowed our government to be bought and sold by a few lobbyists and the billionaires and millionaires who line their pockets with oil, prison, war, gun and insurance money.Read Post | Comments (280)Al Franken, 10/16/12U.S. Senator from MinnesotaGay and lesbian Americans have always been part of our communities. But over the course of the last generation, more and more of them have felt comfortable being truly honest about who they are. And, too slowly but very surely, it\u0027s changing our country for the better.Read Post | Comments (268)Sen. Dianne Feinstein, 10/17/12U.S. Senator from CaliforniaMalala was targeted because she refused to remain silent as the Taliban turned women and girls into second-class citizens. She was targeted because she was an advocate for education. We cannot remain silent.Read Post | Comments (44)Gary Hart, 10/18/12President, Hart International, Ltd.If George McGovern represents the political losers of the world, then I for one am proud to stand with him.Read Post | Comments (168)Richard Cordray, 10/19/12Director, Consumer Financial Protection BureauWe recently found that a significant number of otherwise credit-worthy people may have been denied access to credit cards because they did not have their own income independent of their spouse. We thought this issue deserved further consideration.Read Post | Comments (114)Jillian Michaels, 10/18/12Fitness Expert, Life Coach, AuthorKnowledge is the key to creating a healthier nation. Currently, genetically engineered (GE) foods are not labeled, so we have no way of knowing if the food we are eating is a product of this artificial process.Read Post | Comments (307)Marian Wright Edelman, 10/19/12President, Children\u0027s Defense FundAs election season winds to a close, candidates from all sides are still making their final promises about what they want America to be. Those of us who share Dr. Harding\u0027s vision -- for a just, compassionate, multiracial, joyful nation which cares for children and elders -- must work to make that reality.Read Post | Comments (19)Noam Chomsky, 10/15/12Institute Professor emeritus, MIT Department of Linguistics and PhilosophyIn 1962, war was avoided by Khrushchev\u0027s willingness to accept Kennedy\u0027s hegemonic demands. But we can hardly count on such sanity forever. It\u0027s a near miracle that nuclear war has so far been avoided.Read Post | Comments (342)Christine Lagarde, 10/15/12Managing Director, IMFNatural disasters, unfortunately, will always be with us. And the cost and number of people affected by disasters continues to rise. But this visit to Sendai is a valuable opportunity for me and the others who participated in the Sendai Dialogue to learn how we can strengthen our defenses.Read Post | CommentsSen. Harry Reid, 10/15/12Senate Majority LeaderIf Congressman Ryan truly wants to reduce health care spending, he should look no further than the Affordable Care Act. I will never stop fighting to preserve this successful program.Read Post | Comments (348)Robert Reich, 10/18/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027President Obama should propose that the nation\u0027s biggest banks be broken up and their size capped, and that the Glass-Steagall Act be resurrected. It\u0027s good policy, and it would smoke out Mitt Romney as being of, by, and for Wall Street -- and not on the side of average Americans.Read Post | Comments (963)Rob Goodman and Jimmy Soni, 10/19/12Cato didn\u0027t have Caesar\u0027s military skill, or Cicero\u0027s eloquence, or Pompey\u0027s boyish good looks. But he had something even more formidable: a determination to hold himself, and those around him, to an insanely high standard.Read Post | Comments (205)Rick Steves, 10/19/12Writer of European travel guidebooks and host of travel shows on public television and public radio (www.ricksteves.com)Determined to \"pay their own way,\" John and Jane took out their credit card.

Newsweek rose to equal status with Time -- the founder of the genre -- by being years ahead of it and the rest of the media Establishment on three tectonic stories of the 1960s and 1970s.Read Post | Comments (210)Dominique de Villepin, 10/16/12Fmr. Prime Minster of FranceIt\u0027s time for the United States to face the legacy of a half century of policies in the Middle East, the legacies of the Cold War as well as of the last decade\u0027s neoconservatism.
