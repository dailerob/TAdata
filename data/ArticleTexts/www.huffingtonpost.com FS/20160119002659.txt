{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027Sanders\u0027 surge in recent national polls, and hints he might win both the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primaries, have brought inevitable comparisons to an insurgent candidate whose enthusiastic young supporters took Hillary Clinton by surprise eight years ago. But Barack Obama\u0027s 2008 campaign is not the right comparison. Sanders\u0027s campaign is a very different kind, with deeper potential and a different measure of success. The Sanders campaign, if it succeeds, will build both a movement and a cohort -- a political generation -- around the ideas and policies of this new American socialism. The voters, the networks and above all, the ideas that the campaign is cultivating will remain for other candidates to tap and develop, at all levels of government, from city councils and state legislatures to presidential elections.Going forward, business leaders, not just government leaders, will be judged by whether they succeed in directing the wave of exponential technology innovation to making the world a better place. As another Nobel Peace Prize winner, Martin Luther King Jr. said, \"Life\u0027s most persistent and urgent question is: What are you doing for others?\"Chairman and CEO of SalesforceIt\u0027s a rigged game whose outcome is as certain the spin of the roulette wheel. The owners win; the localities lose; and the fans are played as pawns in a game of financial wheeling-and-dealing.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghKing was a radical. He challenged America\u0027s class system and its racial caste system. He was a strong ally of the nation\u0027s labor union movement. He was assassinated in April 1968 in Memphis, where he had gone to support a sanitation workers\u0027 strike. In his critique of American society and his strategy for changing it, King pushed the country toward more democracy and social justice.E.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeI thought that attending college and medical school at Yale and Harvard, respectively, would be my golden ticket to America\u0027s meritocratic dream, that my prestigious diplomas would shield me from future experiences with racism and bigotry.Third-year medical resident at Massachusetts General HospitalMany of us are hard-wired to believe that new ideas and technologies to change the world for the better. But today there are some dark clouds on the horizon -- challenges and threats to our worldview and way of life that demand a strong response.UK Minister for Internet Safety and SecurityImagine yourself shaken awake, rushed off to a strategy meeting with your presidential candidate of choice, and told: \"Come up with a plan for me to do something about ISIS!\" What would you say?Author of the forthcoming \"Hooper\u0027s War,\" \"Ghosts of Tom Joad: A Story of the #99Percent\" and \"We Meant Well\"NOTE: This review contains spoilers -- both of the movie and also for those tender hearts who think that Leonardo DiCaprio is somehow doing something progressive for Native people.Author, attorney, and member of the Blackfeet Nation and Suquamish territoriesIf the debate is any clue, the Clintons have struck on a new tactic. It\u0027s both interesting and risky. Hillary chose to project herself as the protector of the Obama legacy, and Bernie as trying to tear it down.Senior Fellow, DemosAccording to the latest polls, Bernie is the strongest Democratic candidate in the general election, defeating both Donald Trump and Ted Cruz in hypothetical match-ups.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027By demonizing immigrants as potential criminals and terrorists, the Republican presidential candidates are souring the American people on immigration reform, making it even less likely that Republicans would support comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.Co-Founder of United Farm Workers, President of the Dolores Huerta Foundation, Board Member of People For the American WayBernie Sanders\u0027 new plan for achieving the dream of countless Americans for nearly a century -- healthcare coverage for everyone -- deserves all of our thanks. And nurses will fight to make it come true.Executive director, National Nurses United (AFL-CIO) and California Nurses AssociationWhat makes the problem particularly urgent for the world outside of the Balkans is Macedonia\u0027s status as a major transit point for hundreds of thousands of refugees from war-torn regions, such as Syria, who are entering the country -- mostly on their way to seek resettlement in Europe.Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersIt is fitting that we honor Dr. King\u0027s legacy with a national day of service -- and I look forward to joining my neighbors this morning in volunteering to improve an inner-city Chicago public school -- but, as a society, we can do better than one single day of service.U.S. Representative from Illinois\u0027 8th Congressional DistrictThis is Obama\u0027s America, an America that rejects hate, rejects tribalism. It\u0027s an America where we identify as members of groups based on ethnicity, religion, sexual identity, ideology, etc., but where our common bonds as Americans come first.Author of \u0027Obama’s America: A Transformative Vision of Our National Identity\u0027When we look at the GOP of 2016, it seems very much as though we are witnessing a new version of the Know Nothings of the 1850s. One can only hope that this time it is equally short-lived.Professor of Religious Studies and Human Dimensions of Organizations, University of Texas, AustinWe all knew the day would come when Hillary Clinton would finally have to stop pretending she wasn\u0027t worried about the Bernie Sanders campaign, and it has finally arrived. Her daughter, Chelsea Clinton is now on the road doing stump speeches for her mom and using the opportunity to flat out lie about Bernie Sanders\u0027 healthcare plan.Author of Parenting Without GodSaddam Hussein in the 1990s and currently Bashar al-Assad -- the heads of the Baath party in Iraq and Syria -- both played the religious card. However, Baathist doctrine in Iraq and Syria is basically irreligious. The Saudis are using religion as their excuse now, labeling the recent mass executions as preserving their religion when they are actually a message to frighten their citizens into submission.Foreign Policy In Focus (FPIF) columnistThis prisoner release personifies the persistence and wisdom of the Obama administration\u0027s diplomatic efforts. This exchange is a direct result of the nuclear deal. It simply could not have happened without dialogue between the U.S. and Iran.Research Director, National Iranian American CouncilShame appears to be the only reason government officials in Flint, Michigan decided to pick up their pace helping the people of Flint. Flint is 37 percent Caucasian and 56 percent African-American.Professor of Broadcast \u0026 Digital Journalism, Calif State Univ Northridge and author of \u0027The Digital Media Pyramid\u0027This could well be the first election since 2000 with an independent candidate. That has happened only four times in the past century, the others being 1912, 1948 and 2000. And a three-way -- or even a four-way race --would be a wild card.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Workers\u0027 common interests -- better wages and better lives for themselves and their families -- are much more significant than differences in skin tone or place of worship or gender.United Steelworkers Vice President for Human AffairsWe should acknowledge that Bowie slept with an underage woman to acknowledge that he is human. Yes, his talent was exceptional. No, he was not a monster. But we should never glorify celebrities to the point that we refuse to acknowledge that they\u0027re capable of ugly acts.Blogs Editor, Huffington PostOur nation\u0027s first leaders fought bitterly over everything, but they agreed that certain principles were so fundamental to our character as a nation as to be inalienable.President, American Federation of TeachersToday the immigration question is perhaps as divisive a force in American life as it has ever been, with leading presidential aspirants actually demonizing immigrants generally as criminals, deviants and undercover terrorists. In this season of celebration of Martin Luther King\u0027s birthday, it is important to revisit the factors that animated him in order to protect his memory from being misused to serve purposes that he would never embrace.Senior Fellow, The Opportunity AgendaBernie Sanders will win the first four contests of the 2016 Democratic Primary for the same reasons he won the endorsements 170 economists, MoveOn.org and The Nation. Furthermore, Sanders dominated the latest Democratic debate because he\u0027s never had to evolve from a conservative vantage point, towards a progressive stanceColumnist published in The Cleveland Plain Dealer, The Baltimore Sun, The Hill, Salon, The Jerusalem Post www.hagoodman.comToday is the last day you will be 12. Tomorrow is your birthday, and you will turn 13 years old. You will officially say goodbye to your childhood and will be considered a teenager.Mother, lawyer, writer, dreamer, athleteRiyadh, America\u0027s nominal ally, has demonstrated that it is the more reckless of the two states, by executing an important Shia cleric and severing diplomatic relations with Iran.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteMillions of unlicensed songs doesn\u0027t look like an understandable accident, it looks more like an unacceptable policy. And that would be a policy that is exactly what the compulsory mechanical license was designed to prevent.Founder, Christian L. Castle, AttorneysRanking is not measuring. In fact, ranking often works directly against measuring. As long as our accountability systems focus on ranking students, teachers and schools, they will not tell us how well the education system is actually working.Teacher and writer; blogger, curmudgucation.blogspot.comIn order for Canadian-born Cruz to be deemed eligible for the presidency he would have to rely on liberal, activist judges who view the Constitution as a living document. A true strict constructionist, which Cruz has always fancied himself, would have to say Cruz is NOT eligible.Chicago attorney and former General Counsel of the Illinois Republican PartyGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
