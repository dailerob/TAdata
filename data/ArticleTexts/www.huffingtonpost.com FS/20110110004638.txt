{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Political Editor, The Huffington PostThe deaths in Tucson are not about politics in the narrow sense, ideology or party. From what we know, Jared Loughman\u0027s acts were those of a madman divorced from reality, let alone from public debate. But that doesn\u0027t make Tucson politically meaningless. The president need not, and should not, speak of ideas or programs or parties. What he can speak about, and what perhaps he will speak about, is civility.Read Post | CommentsMichael R. Bloomberg, 01.09.2011108th Mayor of the City of New YorkWe don\u0027t know all the facts from Tuscon, Arizona yet, but we do know that every single day, 34 Americans die to gun violence. And so it will continue until we get serious about cracking down on illegal guns and protecting innocent people.Read Post | CommentsMichael Smerconish, 01.09.2011Radio hostWhile I still think we are at a point where there is more unknown than known about yesterday\u0027s tragedy, it is already obvious that there is about to unfold a long overdue conversation about the level of discourse in this country.Read Post | CommentsGary Hart, 01.08.2011Scholar in Residence at the University of ColoradoWe all know that there are unstable and potentially dangerous people among us.

Chellie Pingree, 01.09.2011Congresswoman (D-ME)Is it really necessary to put the word \"killing\" in the title of a major piece of legislation?

Whether you are a national voice or an individual without a voice -- there are simple questions we all must ask ourselves today.Read Post | CommentsRichard (RJ) Eskow, 01.09.2011Consultant, Writer, Senior Fellow with The Campaign for America\u0027s FutureAfter Tuscon, I\u0027m not falling victim to a false equivalence, nor am I suggesting that the rhetoric is equally violent on both sides. It\u0027s not, and there will be a time to talk about that. But today I choose silence.Read Post | CommentsKathleen Reardon, 01.09.2011We can all choose to extricate ourselves from the unwanted repetitive episodes of vile talk we\u0027re in.

It makes it a blood sport.Read Post | CommentsPaul Helmke, 01.08.2011President, Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun ViolenceWe, as Americans, can and should do more to restore civility to our political discourse. And we must do more to address the easy access to high-powered guns.Read Post | CommentsAlan Grayson, 01.08.2011Former U.S. Congressman from Florida\u0027s 8th DistrictI know nothing about the man who shot Gabby, and what was going through his mind when he did this. But I will tell you this -- there is no way -- no way -- that anyone who really knows Gabby could hate her or hurt her.Read Post | CommentsJose Antonio Vargas, 01.09.2011Senior Contributing Editor, Huffington PostBeing a news junkie takes on a whole new meaning -- and a lot more time -- in the age of Twitter.
