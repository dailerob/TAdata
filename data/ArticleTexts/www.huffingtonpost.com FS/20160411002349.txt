{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week the presidential circus rolled into Wisconsin, with Ted Cruz scoring a big victory against a stumbling Trump. New York Magazine\u0027s Gabriel Sherman suggested those wobbles might be due to burnout. \"People who know Trump say they\u0027ve never seen him so tired,\" he wrote. Supporting evidence comes from modern science, as sleep deprivation symptoms include lack of judgment, inability to process basic information, irritability, mood swings and a paranoid tendency to spout conspiracy theories. Sound familiar? Trump\u0027s biggest contribution to the discourse might be as a cautionary tale about exhaustion, and the resulting consequences of lack of impulse control. And as the campaign heads to the city that never sleeps, I\u0027ll be heading west on a different campaign, to change the way we think about sleep -- that includes a college tour and a campaign against drowsy driving with Uber. In the meantime, all the candidates could do the electorate a favor and get some sleep.We are excited to launch Talk to Me, a new HuffPost series that is classic HuffPost: engagement, conversation, and connecting people across boundaries.Creator and executive producer of \"Talk To Me\" at The Huffington PostI subscribe to the old theory that if you really want to know what\u0027s going on in our United States -- if you want to understand the hearts and minds of a large segment of America at any given moment -- listen to country music and you\u0027ll know.President, News and Guts MediaWhile the dangers of drunk driving are now well known, drowsy driving is still a silent epidemic. Research suggests that tired drivers are responsible for as many as 1.2 million crashes a year which tragically kill 8,000 people. Those numbers are sobering, but hardly surprising.CEO and Co-Founder of UberBlack people know the condescension of a resume check. We know what it is to have a white person signal their confusion over our status or success. These sorts of microaggressions are ways of pointing out the superiority of the dominant group. Ways of saying we don\u0027t belong.Author of \"Who\u0027s Afraid of Post-Blackness? What It Means To Be Black Now\"Even though I\u0027ve always made a point to talk to all three of my kids about my work at the Gates Foundation and my commitment to advocating for women and girls, this conversation felt special. Jenn asked great questions, touching on everything from my experience balancing work and being a mom to whether I\u0027d ever treated my son Rory differently than my daughters.Co-chair, the Bill and Melinda Gates FoundationThe new law states specifically that those who believe that marriage \"should be recognized as the union of one man and one woman\" are empowered to discriminate in hiring, housing and public accommodations against gay couples.Queer Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostThere is one refrain we\u0027ve heard ad nauseam from Senator Mitch McConnell and other Republican Senators, \"The people should decide.\" I have bad news for these Senators.Singer; Actress; Director; Composer; ActivistApril 4 was the 48th anniversary of the murder of Martin Luther King Jr. Pastors get in trouble when they break the silence of their times. MLK spoke at Riverside Church on Sunday April 4, 1967 -- a year to the day before he was killed -- breaking his own silence about the war in Vietnam, much to the chagrin of many of his supporters, and called out the three \"giant triplets of racism, extreme materialism, and militarism.\"Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersIn reality, only one in four families who qualify for housing assistance receives it. In the face of stagnating or falling incomes and soaring housing costs, eviction has become more commonplace in America than ever.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundDrowsy driving doesn\u0027t get the attention it deserves. It\u0027s under reported and is difficult to show as a causal factor in a crash. That doesn\u0027t mean we ought to ignore it, especially when it\u0027s entirely preventable.President and CEO, AAAI realised I was fed up with clinging to my sofa like a raft on the weekend, wishing I had the energy to do all of the things I wanted. And I was definitely fed up with feeling like I was on the brink of work overwhelming me all the time.Executive Editor, The Huffington Post UKThere can be large benefits to countries from trading, and there is no doubt that the United States is enormously richer as a result of international trade. But that hardly means that everyone was benefitted by the patterns of trade over the last three decades, nor is it a reason to support the TPP.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027The Clinton and Sanders campaigns are harming themselves and each of their chances of defeating the Republican nominee by descending into the gutter of charges over whether or not the other is qualified to be President.Entertainment attorney, producer, writer and political activistPlayers who take shortcuts to success may advance for a while, but end up hurting themselves and their teams in the end. Campaigns who ignore the fundamentals of a campaign by failing to turn the self expression of activism into movement-building or organizing will fall short.Chair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusIt\u0027s long past time for consumer protections to catch up to modern realities. For something as important as a family\u0027s retirement savings, there\u0027s no reason the retirement services industry shouldn\u0027t be held to a standard like that of other professions handling such serious matters.U.S. Senator for New JerseyDemocratic Senator from MassachusettsSchumer aside, I\u0027d like to know why Glamour decided to have an issue to celebrate plus size women in the first place. Is it making up for (decades of) lost time? Having an entire issue to plus size women only serves to highlight how exclusive the magazine is the other 11 months of the year - and has been every year since it first launched in 1939.Senior Lifestyle Editor of The Huffington Post UKService-year programs are critical to New York City for more than one reason. They help address our city\u0027s critical needs, but they also develop our city\u0027s workforce and build civic leaders.109th Mayor of New York CityThere are legitimate reasons for not supporting Hillary Clinton, but they are, almost inevitably, only partially complete. She pays a very high price, as a candidate, for her lady genes.Feminist, writer, and satirist (not always in that order)The key to a relaxed attitude involves controlling external demands. Stress does not follow from the quantity of work per time-unit so much as from the fact that the work is imposed -- without our being able to control it.Author, \"Felt Time: The Psychology of How We Perceive Time\"The Department of Labor\u0027s final \"conflict of interest\" rule is rooted in the simple principle that those who are paid for retirement investment advice must act in the best interest of their clients. If that sounds like common sense, that\u0027s because it is.U.S. Secretary of LaborDirector of the National Economic Council and Assistant to the President for Economic PolicyNo one knows when the latest populist political wave will break. Maybe not before Donald Trump is elected president in America. The best way to reduce that possibility, however, and the influence of populist parties in Europe, is to respond to the concerns animating the angry middle.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteMy husband gave up on our marriage. Well, he didn\u0027t exactly give up... He found someone else. So, why would I stay and fight for someone who stabbed me in the back and left me to bleed? Why would I fight to save my marriage, when the one I loved and trusted betrayed my love?Writer, #GoodEnoughMom, loves heart to hearts, and all things Disney. Blogs at charitycraig.comWhether you support Bernie or Hillary, how many of you want Republicans to abolish freedom of reproductive choice? I thought so. But here\u0027s the kicker -- in much of the country, the GOP already has.Novelist and contributing opinion writerAs weeks, months and years fly by, we are all missing opportunities to talk about real things -- important things -- with our parents. There are things that only they can answer or explain. Sadly, the reality is that when they pass, many of those answers, explanations and stories will go with them. So why are we wasting time? Why don\u0027t we ask them the questions that would explain events that shaped them, decisions they made and important lessons they learned? Questions that would yield new insights, understanding and compassion... for people we think we know so well?Managing Editor of Blogs, Huffington Post CanadaThe following is an imagined 1932 New York Daily News editorial board interview with Franklin Roosevelt during his presidential campaign. The Roosevelt statements are taken primarily from his 1933 inaugural address\u003e and his 1936 campaign speech at Madison Square Garden.Author, \"Runaway Inequality: An Activist\u0027s Guide to Economic Justice\"We could, of course, retire the Bank Whistleblowers United\u0027s Lemons title -- for ignoring or trivializing elite fraud -- by awarding it permanently to the Department of Justice (DOJ).Prof; Econ \u0026 Law, UMKC.

Beings of shattered ideas and frailties, beautiful and sufficient in our imperfections. Enough. All of us. Even me.word lover, mama, writer, reader, thinkerOf course Bernie Sanders defeats Kasich by double-digits in the most recent polling, but Kasich and Rubio are both banking on the assumption that Democrats will, against all reason and hard evidence, nominate their least electable candidate.Assistant Professor of English at University of New Hampshire; Series Co-Editor, Best American Experimental WritingSometimes it takes an innocent comment from a child to make us recognize our own behavior. As parents, we’re juggling so much that it’s easy to get stressed out and lose perspective.Chinese-American mom in a bicultural family. Blogs about parenting, culture, food \u0026 travel at www.BiculturalMama.com.\"We won\u0027t see a presidential candidate like Bernie again in our lifetimes.\" As I heard these words, spoken by a woman at a Sanders campaign event recently, I felt a chill go through me.
