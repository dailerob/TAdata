{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"As someone who runs a 24/7 digital media company and who uses every form of social media ever invented, I hope I have some street cred when I urge those of you graduating this year to build boundaries, introduce digital detoxes into your life, learn to regularly disconnect from the jumble and the cacophony and make time to reconnect with yourself. There will be many profound and fulfilling relationships ahead of you, but the relationship with yourself is the most important relationship you\u0027ll ever have. And, like any relationship, it can\u0027t be taken for granted. If there is one thing I wish I knew when I was graduating from college, it\u0027s that the Delphic admonition \"Know Thyself\" and Socrates\u0027 admonition that \"the unexamined life is not worth living\" are not ancient philosophical platitudes, but in fact the most relevant and important guiding truths for our lives.A FTT is a great way to raise large amounts of money to meet important public needs. It will come almost entirely at the expense of the financial industry and should strengthen the economy. We now have one presidential candidate who is prepared to support a strong FTT. Are there others?Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027At a time when we should be celebrating Medicaid and CHIP successes, serious threats to Medicaid, CHIP and the ACA continue to surface in Congress. So, in addition to advocating for continuing improvements in children\u0027s health coverage, we must also play defense to protect the hard-earned gains made for children as well as adults.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundGiven that \"the facts\" the United States used to justify the invasion of Iraq were all wrong, most of the presidential candidates have admitted they might not have launched that particular war. What we have yet to hear from presidential candidates or the habitual hawks is the appropriate spiritual response to the war in Iraq: repentance.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersNo one is focusing on THE central issue that potentially can have an enduring impact, regardless of who is elected president of the United States: The initiation of a massive registration of eligible voters and increasing the magnitude of the actual turnout of those persons who have been registered to vote.Diversity Visiting Professor, University of San Francisco; and Scholar Writer in Residence, MLK, Jr. Institute, Stanford UniversityMany women like how they look in heels. They shouldn\u0027t be made to feel as if they\u0027re abandoning the feminist cause, or kowtowing to the patriarchy if they choose to wear them. It\u0027s possible to want to wear high heels and also want equality in the workplace at the same time.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarI can understand that Rubio doesn\u0027t like to be labeled a homophobe or a hater; but when I hear his and others\u0027 repeated opposition to my marriage to my husband and the family we have created with our son, it feels like a direct attack on who I am and the ones whom I love most.Executive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostBecause of my recent trip to Africa, I now understand how the Clinton family continues to serve. I had the privilege to travel to five initiatives of the Clinton Foundation in Africa. On the trip, I saw first-hand the quiet appreciation on the faces of President and Chelsea Clinton when they observed the real-life results of their work.CEO of EL RothschildArguments against the pending nuclear deal with Iran -- from claiming that the deal is a capitulation to Iran to the notion that it is unacceptable to make a deal with a regime like that in Tehran -- have not sufficiently resonated with the public to kill the agreement. This has caused some disarray in the opposition camp.President, National Iranian American CouncilAcademic and 28-year veteran of the Central Intelligence AgencyThe Senate\u0027s pro-surveillance wing is scrambling to advance new legislation to restore the NSA\u0027s unchecked ability to spy on all of us. And they\u0027re in a rush. Authorization for the federal government\u0027s bulk collection of phone records is set to expire on June 1.Senior Director of Strategy, Free PressIt\u0027s tempting to view the term as an instance of poor branding. Call it a stay-at-home salary and we can all go home. But the \"wife bonus\" is called a \"wife bonus\" because it comes from the brains of people who still don\u0027t view men and women as equals. Changing the words won\u0027t do anything to change their entrenched attitudes.Blogs Editor, Huffington Post CanadaOne big reason America was far more equal in the 1950s and 1960s than now is unions were stronger then. That gave workers bargaining power to get a fair share of the economy\u0027s gains -- and unions helped improve wages and working conditions for everyone.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027In a series of peculiar events that can only be contextually placed in the reality of the 21st century, football, war, and diplomacy meet and intertwine. Today, Russia and the U.S take one more step in their very own modern adaptation of the Cold War in the curious battlefield of international soccer.Masters in Science in Global Affairs and Transnational Security student at New York UniversityNothing illustrates better the moral and intellectual bankruptcy of the Republican war hawks who call themselves presidential candidates than their attempts to whitewash the history of how this nation went to war in Iraq.Professor, historian, authorI want our generation to be the last one to grow up knowing structural and cultural barriers that hold women back. I want our daughters and sons to be able to choose the same college courses and pursue the same careers -- for the same pay.Chief Operating Officer, FacebookThe world capitalist economic system has become so dysfunctional in the 21st Century that it cannot be defended rationally, but requires a particular moral/political ideology grounded in the assumption that human beings are fundamentally to be defined as free, autonomous and rational individuals.Confucian scholarIn the United States, women in the House of Representatives didn\u0027t get a bathroom near the Speaker\u0027s Lobby until 2011. It matters that the vast majority of architects, engineers, construction workers and legislators are not affected by this problem.Feminist, writer, and satirist (not always in that order)Spain is entering into a new time and a new political culture with minority and coalition governments, far from the bipartisanship that for 40 years has favored a predictable alternation between conservatives and social democrats since Franco\u0027s death.Editorial Director, El Huffington PostIt\u0027s 3:00 a.m. here in Waconia, MN. Somewhere in this area are two men sleeping the night away, while my pillow gets heavier and heavier with my tears. You will never remember me. But, I will remember you way more than I should ever have to.Raising 4 boys, 1 is always on the ceiling, 1 is sleeping, 1 is battling cancer and the 4th is raising me.A dozen years before his recent sentencing to a 42-month prison term based, former CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling was in the midst of a protracted and fruitless effort to find someone in Congress willing to look into his accusations about racial discrimination at the agency.Author, \u0027War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death\u0027There may be some differences in style and emphasis, but it\u0027s hard to tell the difference between a Clinton speech and a Warren speech when it comes to most economic questions -- and particularly when it comes to the overarching narrative.Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersI remember being in your shoes. I will never forget it. I remember exactly how they fit, too. It\u0027s easy to judge others in the moment.Mother, writer, foodie, photography amateur, and lover of babies with chunky thighs.If you wish to know what unites, at the deepest level, the fans of jihadism, new-wave Le Pen-ism, and Vladimir Putin\u0027s Eurasia project, then read, without delay, Raphaël Glucksmann\u0027s Génération gueule de bois.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.We don\u0027t need to jump into the arms and beds of different people until one of them decides to stay for a little while longer than the rest. We don\u0027t need titles and commitment that\u0027s rushed, or done so for any reason influenced by others.Writer, Marketing Co-op, and College Student.But we need more than money to sustain independent journalism. We need laws to ensure that reporters can protect their sources. We need to hound government at every level to respond to public records requests.Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyFor the last quarter of a century, NAN and I have advocated on behalf of many victims of racial violence at the hands of police. But in all those years, I\u0027ve never seen a situation that will force a national election to deal with policing as I do now. Translation: GOP candidates will actually have to deal with policing as an issue.President, National Action NetworkHaving a successful marriage has its benefits, such as coming home to the love of your life, and giving advice to unmarried people who don\u0027t want it. If you\u0027re not sure if you\u0027ve found the man you should marry, here are nine key signs to look for.Writer, comedian and creator of TheCooperReview.comFinding life elsewhere would end our cosmic isolation: if there is life in our own planetary backyard, then life is probably common throughout the universe. These enticing possibilities are why my colleagues and I have spent 17 years developing a spacecraft mission dedicated to understanding Europa.Senior Research Scientist, NASA\u0027s Jet Propulsion LaboratoryMany liberal analysts speak of a renaissance of U.S.-Iran relations post-deal, which seems premature, but this is the right-wing nightmare. It is also the Saudis\u0027, who have long enjoyed privileged status in Washington.Executive Director, MIT Center for International StudiesIt was over, and I had to deal with it. I had to realize that the expectant chapter of motherhood had ended for me, and it was time to close that book and shift my thoughts from prenatal to preschool.Businesswoman, blogger, momJohn Nash was a legend. He simply looked at things differently. He taught me that even geniuses need other people to correct their thinking and vet their ideas. Most importantly, however, Nash taught me that anyone\u0027s mind can be beautiful if it focuses on producing beautiful ideas.Writes about the quirks of life that make it beautifulGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
