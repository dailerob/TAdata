A handful of billionaires can decide who the next president will be. If our Supreme Court doesn\u0027t find that corrupt, then they are using a very different dictionary than the rest of America.Read Post | Comments (245)James Zogby, 2/18/12President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Anthony Shadid was a man for others, for Arabs and Americans. He was our bridge to a world we impact so profoundly, but whose reality we do not know. And now he is gone.Read Post | CommentsDiana Butler Bass, 2/18/12Author, \"Christianity After Religion: The End of Church and the Birth of a New Spiritual Awakening\"Large numbers of Americans are hankering for experiential faith whereby they can connect with God, the divine, or wonder as well as with their neighbors and that lead to a more profound sense of meaning in the world.Read Post | Comments (163)Mark Hyman, MD, 2/18/12Practicing physicianMy personal hope is that together we can create a national conversation about a real, practical solution for the prevention, treatment, and reversal of our obesity, diabetes and chronic disease epidemic. Getting off wheat may just be an important step.Read Post | Comments (40)Brian Levin, J.D., 2/18/12Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityWhat better image for all the young fans like me at Shea back then, on the cusp of their adulthood, to carry into middle age for their children: that despite setbacks, sometimes nice guys with heart and perseverance do actually finish first.Read Post | CommentsCat Cora, 2/17/12ChefEvery year, more than 2.5 million children globally die due to hunger and malnutrition. The exciting news is that this crisis is solvable. I saw that firsthand last week on a trip to Ethiopia.Read Post | CommentsCheryl Saban Ph.D., 2/17/12Author and advocate for women and childrenWhen love comes into your life, and you feel it in your bones, nurture it and cultivate it, because it is something we all long for, and we want it at every age.Read Post | Comments (15)Rev. Susan Russell, 2/17/12Episcopal priest and activist from Pasadena, Calif.By vetoing the marriage equality bill passed by the state legislature, the Governor of New Jersey chose to stand for bigotry rather than equality. New Jersey deserves better. America deserves better. And Governor Christie should know better.Read Post | CommentsMarian Wright Edelman, 2/17/12President, Children\u0027s Defense FundAt one time, the Nations owned a home. But like so many other American families, their standard of living has declined over the past decade even though they are a two-parent working family.Read Post | Comments (52)Robert Reich, 2/17/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Aftershock\u0027Suddenly, manufacturing is back -- at least on the election trail. But don\u0027t be fooled. The real issue isn\u0027t how to get manufacturing back. It\u0027s how to get good jobs and good wages back. They aren\u0027t at all the same thing.Read Post | Comments (358)Joe Peyronnin, 2/17/12NYU Journalism ProfessorPerhaps former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum should take a couple aspirin and get some rest. It appears the pressure of being the front-runner in the Republican presidential sweepstakes is getting to him.Read Post | Comments (371)Gary Arnold, 2/17/12President, Little People of AmericaI expected her to address her fears as an opportunity to bridge the gap between her own misunderstanding of dwarfism and the reality. Rather than erase any distance, O\u0027Donnell reinforced the gap.Read Post | Comments (50)Jeffrey Sachs, 2/17/12Director, Earth Institute at Columbia University; author, \u0027The Price of Civilization\u0027One of the unshakable myths of the punditariat is that the federal government is going bankrupt because of entitlements spending, especially spending on Medicare and Medicaid. This is a stampede of unreason, contradicted by the facts.Read Post | Comments (605)Sami Moubayed, 2/17/12Editor-in-Chief, Forward MagazineTony Shadid will live on -- through his articles, and through the young men and women who are standing up for freedom, a cause that he so passionately believed in.Read Post | CommentsMeredith Bodgas, 2/17/12Blogger, MeritalBliss.comIt\u0027s well-known that what happens at the bachelor party stays at the bachelor party, but these other secrets grooms keep may not be as obvious.Read Post | Comments (41)Katie Goodman, 2/17/12Award-winning comic, actress, author, creative coach, and social activistIs this what my adult life has come to? Is Facebook really in a position to take away my car keys and TV privileges? This is like the best Firm Parenting Class for teens ever. Facebook does not get tired or annoyed and cave in, and there\u0027s no way for me to contest it. What\u0027s an anti-authority political satirist to do?Read Post | Comments (99)Marge Baker, 2/17/12Executive Vice President for Policy and Program, People For the American WayThe right is staging an all-out assault on women\u0027s rights while they have control of the majority of state legislatures, the House and a determined minority in the Senate. The GOP\u0027s presidential candidates are promising to join it if they get elected. We can\u0027t let them succeed.Read Post | Comments (312)Will Durst, 2/17/12Political comic, former radio talk show host, syndicated columnist, author, motivational speakerDon\u0027t mean to overreact and risk boosting everybody\u0027s blood pressure, but this might be a halfway decent time to seek out a nice safe steel bunker to hunker down in, because it\u0027s awards season and heavy metal statuettes are being tossed around like dimes at a county fair.Read Post | CommentsRobert Naiman, 2/17/12Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicySponsors of the Lieberman resolution deny that it is an \"authorization for military force,\" and in a legal, technical sense, they are absolutely correct: it is not a legal authorization for military force. But it is an attempt to enact a political authorization for military force.Read Post | Comments (204)Kyle Rabin, 2/17/12Program Director, GRACE Communications FoundationWhat originated as an industry term (fraccing or fracking) has been co-opted by opponents to hydraulic fracturing much to the industry\u0027s chagrin. Industry would love to turn back time and bury that word in a place no one will find it. But the genie is out of the bottle.Read Post | Comments (12)Chris Weigant, 2/17/12Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comThe line between certain types of comedy and the political/media world should be brighter than ever. This is a lesson Dana Milbank of the Washington Post apparently has yet to learn.Read Post | Comments (39)Emily McConnell, 2/17/12Senior, Penn StateTomorrow, the energies of Penn State University will be devoted to one thing.
