But thanks to CNN\u0027s commitment to unashamedly driving right at the heart of America\u0027s paranoid political style, the gun manufacturers\u0027 lobby was there in spirit, courtesy of moderator Anderson Cooper -- who seized on a moment of relative calm to get wacky and wild-eyed.

Obama endeavored to explain how it came to pass that the lawmakers Kelly encountered had come to believe what they believed, when Cooper suddenly came to the aid of the conspiracy-mongers.Future economic historians may not call the period that began in 2007 \"The Greatest Depression.\" But as of now it is highly and increasingly probable that they will call it \"The Longest Depression.\" So what can be done?Professor of economics, U.C.

You don\u0027t have to look beyond our borders for the enemy that will bring us down. Just into a mirror.Senior writer, BillMoyers.com. Former senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.To put this in a religious context: overcoming the divisions of race has been central to the church since its beginning, and the dynamic diversity of the body of Christ is one of the most powerful forces in the global church. Our Christian faith stands fundamentally opposed to racism in all its forms, which contradict the good news of the gospel.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersThe U.S.-led order for the region established in the 1990s was bound to collapse. It was based on the exclusion of two of the Mideast\u0027s most powerful states -- Iran and Iraq -- and could only be sustained as long as the U.S. was willing to pay for it through its own blood and treasure. The influence and privilege Saudi Arabia enjoyed under American order will no longer be the same -- because that order is no more.President, National Iranian American CouncilWatching a grizzled, greasy DiCaprio spend roughly two hours dragging, bleeding, drooling, groaning, and shivering himself across a frozen landscape could hardly be described as engaging storytelling.Gentleman farmer, film critic for ReThink ReviewsHave you ever talked about what goes on in your own family?

Is it a sore point?Feminist, writer, and satirist (not always in that order)Producer \u0026 Deputy Director, Programs at BreakthroughNo one should profit off of putting people behind bars.

Capitalism at its worst tells a story about winners and losers.Playwright and Political Science Professor; Writing Fellow at Quinnipiac UniversityMontenegro neither threatens nor is threatened by anyone.

You can break down the circumstances. But at the end of the day, what can I really say that will call you to action?Writer, actor, and directorYes, I have high expectations when it comes to African Americans and Islamophobia.
