{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AriannaThere are many good things about launching the Huffington Post. But the one I’m most excited about today is the ability to turn the spotlight on stories that despite their significance remain under-reported and under-discussed -- whether its Iraq and its impact on the war on terror, the preventable causes of autism, credit card company abuses, gang violence, the superciliousness of TV anchors, or that dread malady known as Bloggers Block.05.23.2005 Jim LampleyThe only saving grace in the Pat Tillman scandal is that he was fighting terrorists in Afghanistan instead of manufacturing them in Iraq. Tillman\u0027s parents deserve bravery citations for telling the truth about their feelings. Surely the Bush administration was expecting otherwise. Maybe the gushing outpourings of \"patriotic\" response to Tillman\u0027s heroism a year ago can now be replaced by sober and serious reflection on the overall bill of goods which is being sold to the public.read whole post | permalink05.23.2005 Danielle Crittendenread whole post | permalink05.23.2005 Christine LahtiWouldn’t it be great if our First Lady, on her next overseas trip to promote the rights of women, went directly to Africa? In my fantasies, I can see her handing out condoms, AIDS education pamphlets and medical supplies during her visit. Now that would be a picture worth a thousand words -- one worth seeing around the globe.read whole post | permalink05.23.2005 Brad HallIt’s always opposite day with this bunch: No Child Left Behind, \"Mission Accomplished!\", Patriot Act, Healthy Forests Initiative, honoring Tom DeLay, et al. Got to be Opposite Day, right? The problem is that they’re leaving out Opposite Day’s most basic element: the part where you shout, “It’s Opposite Day!” If you don’t say those magic words, you’re just a liar liar pants on fire. A playground theme develops: Bullying, name-calling, teasing the smart kids, changing the rules as you go along... Somebody needs a time-out.read whole post | permalink05.23.2005 Rob ReinerUntil our nation\u0027s parents get organized, American politicians will continue to say \"Children are our future\" without delivering a coherent public policy that honors those words in action with universal preschool, universal health care, quality child care and a real investment in public education. That is why we are reintroducing ourselves with a bold new name -- Parents\u0027 Action for Children -- as the first voice for America\u0027s parents; a voice that has the power to change our political landscape and achieve real results for America\u0027s families.read whole post | permalink05.23.2005 Kevin HassettI am testifying before the Senate Finance Committee today, and as I was preparing this morning I noticed something unusual. The hearing looks like it should be productive and nonpartisan. Each individual scheduled to testify has a unique and substantive perspective, and none of them have an axe to grind. Perhaps, then, we have formally identified the one thing other than terror capable of bringing the left and right together. The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT).read whole post | permalink05.22.2005 Larry GelbartWhy is the Air Force Academy behaving as though the flying machine was invented by the far-Wright Brothers? Don\u0027t equal opportunity considerations require the creation of an American-Jewish Air Force, as well? One that would fly only from right to left?read whole post | permalink05.23.2005 Trey EllisWhat interests me most is how some black men seem to discover their “blackness” only when every other avenue seems closed to them. O.J. had hardly a black friend among his buddies at the Riviera Country Club and yet he ran straight to the all-forgiving black bosom as soon as the blood had dried on his Bruno Maglis (allegedly of course).read whole post | permalink05.22.2005 Walter ShapiroDemocrats, reflecting the triumph of hope over experience, seem convinced that they can win the spin wars that will follow this week’s probable GOP victory. Color me dubious, since historically the filibuster has had few champions in the popular culture, aside, of course, from Frank Capra.read whole post | permalink05.22.2005 Geoffrey R. StoneIf the Democrats don\u0027t demonstrate now that they will not permit a president elected by less than 52% of the American people to dictate the ideology of 100% of our federal judges, then this administration will have a free-hand to remake the federal courts wholesale.read whole post | permalink05.22.2005 Elizabeth WarrenYou have a low interest credit card and you do everything the card company wants -- payments on time to the company, payments on time to everyone else, clean fingernails -- everything, so your interest rate stays the same, right? Wrong.read whole post | permalink05.21.2005 Mark JosephNobody enjoys a football game where one side is running up the score while the other side self-destructs. If Howard Dean keeps this up, he’s not only going to elect another Republican president in three and a half years, he’s going to give the GOP a veto-proof majority in the Senate, making the filibuster a moot issue. Here\u0027s how Democrats can get back in the game...read whole post | permalink05.22.2005 Arianna HuffingtonThere I was, as is my Sunday morning tradition, watching Meet the Press while doing yoga. (Or is it doing yoga while watching Meet the Press? Whatever.) Tim Russert was interviewing Howard Dean. At least, I’m pretty sure it was Russert. For one thing, I was in the Uttanasana II position, so I couldn’t see very well. For another, what I was hearing sounded remarkably like some White House flack...read whole post | permalink05.21.2005 Max BlumenthalJacques Pluss was a history professor at Fairleigh Dickinson University. In his spare time, he affiliated with the National Socialist Movement, which bills itself as \"America\u0027s Nazi Party.\" As a result, he was fired. Afterwards, Pluss went on the NSM\u0027s radio show, \"White Viewpoint,\" to denouce FDU as a \"Jewish plutocratic university.\" While he was at it, he called the school\u0027s basketball team, \"nigger to the core.\" Now, David Horowitz has taken up his cause.read whole post | permalink05.22.2005 James BoyceToday I spoke with a top Democratic fundraiser, smart guy, best of the best, and I quote: “The Democratic consultants here in Washington are convinced that the 2008 election will be all about domestic issues.” Sure it will be.
