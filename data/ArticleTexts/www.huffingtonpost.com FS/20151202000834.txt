{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Archbishop Emeritus of Cape TownFounder and Executive Director of the Tutu Institute for Prayer and PilgrimageThe days of not understanding the disastrous human and environmental consequences of rampant consumptiveness and greed are gone. Our leaders can no longer claim not to know. If they don\u0027t take action, they will be saying very clearly that they don\u0027t care. Should they grasp the opportunity, and develop a legally binding treaty to mitigate climate change, it will signal the end of the age of reckless consumption, exploitation and greed. Failing to grasp the nettle will send a direct message of contempt to poorer nations and people, who cannot afford the costs of mitigating the impacts of increasing temperatures. It will trigger unprecedented economic and refugee crises, and dramatically deepen global insecurity.While the lifespan of affluent whites continues to lengthen, the lifespan of poor whites has been shrinking. As a result, in just the last four years, the gap between poor white men and wealthier ones has widened by up to four years.New York Times bestselling authorIn 1939, it was the Jews whose lives were threatened. Today, it is the Syrians. I can think of no cause more important, and more satisfying, than saving the lives of those threatened by racial, religious, sexual or political persecution.President emeritus, Open Society InstituteThis commitment will require shifting the global energy system to clean energy and innovation across all sectors of the economy. It will unleash new technological solutions, mobilise large-scale investment, and shape consumer behavior, all of which will create new jobs and unprecedented economic opportunities.Founder, Virgin GroupDirector of the board\u0027s sustainable development committee, Kering; Co-Founder and Co-Chair, The B TeamThe silence from the \"pro-life\" crowd is appalling and damning, now that their rhetoric of \"baby killer\" has, once again, been taken seriously by someone who didn\u0027t realize they were just putting on political theater.Pastor, Blogger, Soccer Mom, FeministBefore it\u0027s too late, don\u0027t you want to find out how nuts some of these people really are? I sure do. So here are my suggested questions for a truly enlightening evening.Novelist and contributing opinion writerMarch virtually on Paris by changing your Facebook profile picture to the Earth at bit.ly/toloveearth. It\u0027s easy, and there is no Planet B.Chairman and founder, FentonYou deserve a chance to experience the beautiful world that I grew up in. We all need clean air, clean water and natural resources to lead healthy lives.Senate Minority Leader (D-Nev.)The TV presentation and DVD Close To You: Remembering the Carpenters is a poignant musical portrait of Richard Carpenter and his late sister, Karen that airs on Public Television stations nationwide this Saturday, December 5th, with encore telecasts throughout the month.Trafficbeat Entertainment, Music Biz VetThe choice to fight terrorism is simple: we can alienate the seven million proud Muslim Americans, or we can ardently protect and defend the civil rights and civil liberties of our compatriots, honor their right to practice their religion, and recognize that they can be law enforcement\u0027s key partners in preventing terrorism.Lawyer and criminologistDecorating for the season doesn\u0027t mean having to ape Christmas.

There are so many creative ways to light up your home for Hanukkah without defaulting to a \"Hanukkah Bush.\"Creative Director and CEO, Fig Tree \u0026 VineThe criminalization and mass incarceration of people who use illicit drugs, along with policies that restrict access to sterile syringes and opioid maintenance therapies (such as methadone and Suboxone), have facilitated the spread of HIV/AIDS, not to mention other blood borne diseases, such as hepatitis C.New York deputy state director, Drug Policy AllianceClinton\u0027s infrastructure plan says only that it will be paid for through \"business tax reform.\" It does not detail the nature of the reforms that would pay for this spending. Similarly, Sanders does not yet have a specific individual and corporate tax proposal, but he has proposed a financial transaction tax and says he will close loopholes.Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureSomewhere among the late responders stands the choreographer. While the dancer can improvise her response to a cataclysm on the spot, the choreographer must devise a language of movement that must first be conveyed to a dancer who in turn must convey it to an audience.Cultural critic, essayist and novelist published with Parkett, Art in America and Bijutsu TechoIt wasn\u0027t this new \"American Terrorism\" term that\u0027s been used lately to counter stereotypes against Islamophobia. It\u0027s much deeper than that. White Supremacy-the over-arching oppressive sense of entitlement by racist/sexist white men-is what\u0027s killing many in this country, and have been since the beginning of America\u0027s birth.Philadelphia\u0027s Youngest Columnist \u0026 TV Show HostIt is no coincidence that most of the world\u0027s hungry -- more than 80 percent of the 795 million hungry people -- live in countries which are increasingly prone to floods, droughts and storms that can trap them in a cycle of chronic hunger and poverty.Executive Director of the United Nations World Food ProgrammeThe battle to stop climate change is entirely winnable. Only a very small number of people stand in the way. But they are very wealthy, powerful, corrupt people, and the hour is growing late. Do we let them win? It\u0027s #TimeToChoose.Director, Wall Street documentary \u0027Inside Job\u0027; Author, \u0027Predator Nation\u0027Education systems that systematically sort students into winners and losers based on narrow definitions of achievement contribute to an ever-worsening divide between social groups; this is exacerbated when those lines fall closely along ethnic divides.Journalism/English teacherAfter the initial adjustment of the first week, I was no longer walking to the vending machine or my corner store for my 3pm must-have-sweets-now break. It was honestly awesome to not feel that need.Health.com motivates you to eat smart, stay fit, be happy, and live your best life.Campus sexual assaults may lead to significant financial costs and lost earning potential of promising students whose victimization can delay or derail their career goals or permanently postpone their college careers, if they end up dropping out.Economist and Associate Director of UT Austin’s Bureau of Business ResearchProfessor at The University of Texas at Austin’s School of Social WorkGood teachers teach more than just their content; they teach civility as well. They teach the next generation how to interact with one another, even if they disagree politically.Student, Teacher, and Social Justice AdvocateThe success of the Montgomery bus boycott remains a shining example and model for what can be achieved through nonviolent activism. Six decades later, the University of Missouri Tigers football team flexed its muscles when it decided to boycott future games and practices until MU system President Tim Wolfe stepped down or was removed from office over allegations that he failed to address continuing charges of racism and discrimination in the four-school system.Supervisor for the Second District of Los Angeles CountyTax-cut proponents predicted an economic boom, not meager growth. When Governor Sam Brownback signed the tax cuts into law, he said they would provide \"a shot of adrenaline into the heart of the Kansas economy.\"Director of State Fiscal Research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities\u0027Dear Mr Hitchcock: There are many directors with a love of cinema, but what you possess is a love of celluloid itself and it is that which I would like to talk to you about...\u0027 \u0027Dear Mr.Truffaut: Your letter brought tears to my eyes...\u0027Culture Columnist, Huffington Post, CultureZohnLeave no one behind. Africa\u0027s energy systems are inefficient and unjust. They provide subsidized electricity for the wealthy, unreliable power supplies for firms and very little for the poor.Executive Director of the Africa Progress PanelTed Cruz is an outsider in insider\u0027s clothing, and voters uneasy with the weirdness of Trumson are starting to move in his direction. And there may not be enough other Republicans to beat a candidate who captures the bulk of the raging outsider vote.Senior Fellow, DemosIt\u0027s interesting to watch the presidential candidates fighting over a 0.2 percentage point tax increase. It would be much more interesting to see them debate a Federal Reserve Board policy that can have an impact on after-tax pay that is 40 times larger.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027We work to find and promote the most effective ways to help animals. We do this by evaluating interventions commonly used to help animals, evaluating animal charities and providing advice to the general animal advocacy community on how to be most effective with their resources.Executive Director, Animal Charity EvaluatorsWhen the perpetrator of terrorism is mainly motivated by his or her own religious views -- say, about abortion -- then it is by definition Christian terrorism. All the killings of abortion clinic doctors and other employees are nothing short of Christian terrorism.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comThe rest of the time, (which is anytime my kids and I are awake at the same time, in case you didn\u0027t catch that) I\u0027m a less-than-stellar parent. I hate to admit this, because I really wanted to join the Perfect Parents club, and I know there will probably be a whole lot of Perfect Parents out there lamenting the fact that I have six boys who should probably only be trusted to Perfect Parents.Author, poet, humorist, avid reader. Wife of one, mama of six. Blogger at Crash Test Parents and Racheltoalson.comCommunicating the dangers of fossil fuels and the need to transition to a renewable energy-based economy is something these meetings have achieved, and the importance of that achievement should not be underestimated.Executive Director, Columbia University\u0027s Earth InstituteGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
