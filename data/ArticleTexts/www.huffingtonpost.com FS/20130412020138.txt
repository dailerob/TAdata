{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jason LinkinsEditor, Eat the PressThere is this thing called the \"massive unemployment crisis\" that needs to be addressed someday and I daresay Americans would be totally impressed with Congress if they gave up the deficit hysteria and attempted to address it instead. The good news there is that full employment would unleash history\u0027s greatest deficit reduction engine, so it\u0027s a two-fer. But if we really need Congress to take action and restore our faith in the notion that they aren\u0027t a bunch of idiot-sticks, we could take baby steps. Say... pass a law that improved background checks for gun purchasers? This is something that nine in 10 Americans support, but congressional dysfunction has us on tenterhooks, wondering if they\u0027ll pull off enacting the most publicly supported policy that they\u0027ll have the privilege of considering all year.Comments (392)Bob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowYesterday, the president released his 2014 budget and proposed the truly stupid idea of linking Social Security cost-of-living-adjustments to something called \"chained CPI.\" Not only is the idea a punitive one for seniors, but the president is also fueling a series of inside-D.C. myths.Comments (242)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027Today, on the National Mall, I stood with fellow faith leaders, including clergy from Newtown, to remember lives lost at Sandy Hook elementary school and the 3,364 gun deaths that have happened since.Comments (84)Frances BeineckePresident, Natural Resources Defense CouncilGina McCarthy has been tapped to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, and given her track record of protecting America\u0027s families from toxic pollution, her confirmation will help us all breathe easier.CommentsRandi ZuckerbergFounder and CEO, Zuckerberg Media; Editor-In-Chief, Dot ComplicatedLately, I\u0027ve heard many people complain that they feel inundated by Kickstarter requests. Rather than a platform to support creative visionaries, it\u0027s become just another way to hit people up for money.CommentsMichelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesO\u0027Reilly surely is quite cognizant of keeping his ratings high as he sees support for gay marriage rise rapidly in the polls. But if the debate over marriage equality now needs to move into the Fox News audience, it\u0027s certainly not a bad thing to have O\u0027Reilly taking on the anti-equality crowd.Comments (84)Arianna HuffingtonI\u0027m delighted to announce The RaiseForWomen Challenge, an initiative to help women-focused nonprofits gain resources and recognition, in partnership with The Skoll Foundation, Crowdrise, and Sheryl WuDunn and Nick Kristof\u0027s Half the Sky Movement.Comments (26)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; host, \u0027The Breakdown\u0027; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureThe \"chained CPI\" proposal in President Obama\u0027s budget continues to draw much-deserved fire, which is only likely to increase. Here are nine embarrassing facts about the chained CPI which the White House and its defenders would prefer to see overlooked.Comments (121)Mattea KramerSenior Research Analyst, NPPFar from being an impossible set of demands, the collective opinion poll version of the wisdom of the American people is, in fact, a smart set of solutions -- or at least it would be, if we had a government capable of following our wishes.Comments (24)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorRepublican intransigence on tax revenues will continue to produce the gridlock that\u0027s ground fiscal policy to a halt, though perhaps now even the most misguided commentators will not be able to frame this as \"a pox on both their houses!\"Comments (213)Jonah BergerAuthor, \u0027Contagious: Why Things Catch On\u0027Want to know why things go viral? Why some products get more word of mouth? Let me tell you a secret. It\u0027s not luck.Comments (22)Clayton KershawPitcher, Los Angeles DodgersSomething remarkable started the moment my wife, Ellen, and I first met Hope on a ministry trip to Zambia four years ago.CommentsSec. Ken SalazarU.S. Secretary of the InteriorWhen I took office, too few national historic landmarks focused on the lives of women, Asian Americans, African Americans, Latinos or other diverse communities that make up the fabric of our nation.CommentsDr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarWhat a better time than this, National Poetry Month, to enter another sort of discussion: the common space poems create for reflection -- on the challenges we face, the choices we make, and the invaluable importance of all women do.Comments (20)Andre Leon TalleyContributing editor, VogueWhen my best friends doubt their little black dresses, they call me on the telephone seeking reassurance. As Oscar Wilde wrote in his play An Ideal Husband, \"Men are the only authorities on dress.\"CommentsRick StevesWriter of European travel guidebooks and host of travel shows on public television and public radio (www.ricksteves.com)Khan el-Khalili, one of the largest markets in the Arab world, is a tourist magnet. And even today -- with almost no tourism -- it still feels touristy.CommentsTerrell Jermaine StarrAssociate Editor, NewsOneDespite my hardships, I\u0027d like to think I would have rebounded and ended up doing just fine had I not messaged my father on Facebook. But why settle for doing \"just fine\" when you can be doing great?Comments (15)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The president\u0027s predilection for negotiating with himself is not new. But his willingness to do it with Social Security, the government\u0027s most popular program -- which Democrats have protected from Republican assaults for almost eighty years -- doesn\u0027t bode well.Comments (664)Kim SimonMother, Wife, Blogger, mamabythebay.comI\u0027ve been an advocate for formula-feeding without shame, and I believe with every ounce of my mama heart that babies who are nourished with formula are still fed with love. Still, I am desperate to nurse.Comments (20)Alon Ben-MeirSenior Fellow, NYU\u0027s Center for Global AffairsIt is clear that if the Israelis and the Palestinians hold fast to their positions, it will be nearly impossible to allay distrust, leading to a continuing deadlock because distrust cannot be negotiated by simply agreeing to establish a new trusting relationship.Comments (21)Joan GageA Rolling CroneAlthough I didn\u0027t find what I wanted, I unearthed a treasure that I didn\u0027t think existed -- a photo of my parents dressed for their wedding in August of 1932.CommentsTom EngelhardtEditor, TomDispatch.comHagel is considered a \"realist\" and so when it comes to such cuts, this is undoubtedly the best we\u0027re likely to get out of Washington for a long time to come. Unfortunately, it turns out that the best is pretty poor stuff.Comments (32)Evelyn LeopoldVeteran journalist reporting from the United NationsThe president of the U.N. General Assembly decided to hold an all day debate on whether international justice promoted reconciliation. But his real purpose was to undermine a war crimes tribunal on the former Yugoslavia because of a perceived bias towards Serbs.CommentsPeter DiamandisChairman/CEO, X PRIZE FoundationIn this blog, I\u0027m continuing my conversation with Jay Rogers, CEO and co-founder of Local Motors, the open-source automotive design company. Here, Jay shares how he builds and engages his 30,000-person crowd.CommentsGlen CanningFather of Rehtaeh ParsonsI don\u0027t want her life to defined by a Google search about suicide or death or rape. I want it to be about the giving heart she had. Her smile. Her love of life and the beautiful way in which she lived it. I found out this afternoon my daughter saved the life of a young woman with her heart. How fitting.Comments (630)MJ RosenbergSpecial Correspondent, Washington SpectatorThe good news is that Netanyahu has made everything so clear. He has no interest in peace, negotiations, any kind of territorial withdrawal or even freezing settlements. The only question left is what the Obama administration will do in response.Comments (192)Eric AltermanDistinguished Professor of English, Brooklyn College, City University of New YorkThe problem, however, is that while such support is wide, it is rarely deep. Since it is an electoral-process issue, it does not frequently excite voters -- and even when it does, it usually fails to excite reporters.CommentsLynda LopezEmmy Award-winning journalistMy sister Jennifer and I wanted to start our work to bring telemedicine technology to areas like Panama. And it\u0027s a goal we share with one of the programs in our Global Mom Relay -- the Mobile Alliance for Maternal Action.CommentsRussell BrandActor and comedianWhen I was a kid, Thatcher was the headmistress of our country. Her voice, a bellicose yawn, somehow both boring and boring -- I could ignore the content but the intent drilled its way in. I am, safe to say, one of Thatcher\u0027s children. How then do I feel on this day of matriarchal mourning?Comments (776)Seth ShulmanSenior Staff Writer, Union of Concerned ScientistsThe implications outlined in the 102-page report are indeed significant. Among the findings: South Carolina faces an average temperature rise of as much as 9 degrees Fahrenheit over the next 70 years.Comments (48)Craig KanalleySenior Editor, Big News \u0026 Live Events, The Huffington PostThe first time I saw the HTC First, a Facebook employee gave a demonstration of it. Yeah, seems cool. Alright. I get it. But I want to see my friends on it... Now I have one to test myself. And as expected, what a difference that makes.
