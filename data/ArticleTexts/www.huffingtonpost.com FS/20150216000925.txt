{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, Jon Stewart announced his retirement from The Daily Show. He\u0027ll be missed -- not just because he was funny, but because he told the truth in an era when much of the media wouldn\u0027t. Later that same night, 60 Minutes correspondent Bob Simon was killed in a car accident. \"There was nothing simple about Bob Simon,\" said Anderson Cooper. \"Except that he was simply the best.\" The next day, David Carr collapsed and died in the New York Times newsroom. The grace and wisdom he earned the hard way suffused his generous spirit. He never sugar-coated his insights, especially about recovery and redemption. \"We all walk this earth feeling we are frauds,\" he wrote. \"The trick is to be grateful and hope the caper doesn\u0027t end any time soon.\" Sadly, with David and Bob Simon, it ended much too soon.NBC News\u0027 investigative unit has a unique opportunity to find out why its award-winning journalism fell so short of the mark on one of the biggest domestic stories of this young century. Whether they succeed or fail will be far more important than the ultimate fate of Brian Williams.Your dog\u0027s best friendIf the United States is truthfully aiming to curb its global military endeavors, neither Congress nor the president are making that clear. The faux dispute over the most recent proposal ignores the realities of this administration\u0027s legal logic and leaves its endless war mentality intact. The job description for 2016 hopefuls may as well read \"No Limits.\"Host/Producer, HuffPost LiveContagious: Why Things Catch On established Jonah Berger as a thought leader on a subject with big implications for the future of media: why we share. As The Huffington Post launches What\u0027s Working, an editorial initiative to double down on our coverage of positive news and solutions, I asked Jonah, a Wharton Business School professor, for his insights.Julia announced that she was transgender and would heretofore prefer to be referred to as \"he\" and by a new name \"Jules.\" I instantly understood why \"he\" did not want his hair done. He did not want to look like a girl.MotherAs Valentine\u0027s Day approaches, our thoughts turn to romance. Unfortunately, many of our cultural myths about love, from fairy tales to rom coms, paint a very distorted picture. Love is not the pot of gold waiting at the end of a quest, incarnated in a single perfect partner. Instead it\u0027s something we need with us every step of the way.Psychotherapist; Executive/life coachI asked myself what I would want my friends to do when I go and I\u0027ll put those few of you on notice now: I want more than a tweet. So here is a moment for David Carr.Author, \u0027Public Parts\u0027 and \u0027What Would Google Do?\u0027Wouldn\u0027t we be a gentler, more educative culture if, instead of wallowing in Williams\u0027 shame, we treated it as an opportunity for all of us to discuss and examine the nature of the humanity we have in common?Founder, People for the American WayMarking, celebrating and memorializing the beautiful lives of Deah, Yuzor and Razan is, in addition to whatever comfort and solace it can bring the aggrieved, an opportunity for all of us who didn\u0027t know them to reflect on how we ourselves might be better people.Director of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel HillDo all sons want to be \"better\" than their fathers? Do all fathers want the same for their sons -- that they grow to be \"better\" -- or do they secretly, perhaps unconsciously, always want to be someone their sons can look up to in every which way?Author, research psychologist and gender scholarDemocrats are encouraged to hear Republicans co-opting our rhetoric on the economy and we stand at the ready to work with Republicans to get things done for the middle class. But only when Republican policy proposals catch up to their rhetoric will we have an opportunity for real solutions.Democratic U.S. Senator from New YorkWhat made Bob Simon different for me was that he didn\u0027t shy away from traveling to the \"hot spots.\" At the time that his colleagues were enjoying the Tel Aviv sun and beach, Bob was ploughing the streets of Gaza and the villages of the West Bank looking for that unique voice.Palestinian journalistI watch these arguments trotted out on Facebook and Twitter citing false science and long discredited \"studies\" that just won\u0027t stop and Jenny McCarthy quotes and \"it\u0027s my choice\" to not vaccinate... and I think... what would you have done if your child lay dying?MotherPresident Obama is absolutely correct that our nation must confront these ruthless terrorists. But he was also correct to promise that America would not be sending U.S. combat troops back to the Middle East to fight another ground war.Senior Member of the Senate Foreign Relations CommitteeSome Alabama probate judges, at least for the time being, are defying the United States Supreme Court today, refusing to grant marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples while other judges throughout the state are granting those licenses.Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesThe limits under Obama\u0027s proposed authorization are an important distinction, which we hope will carry on through future administrations. However, on maybe the most important limit -- the limit on types of operations our ground troops can be committed to -- the language is too broad, and leaves too much room for drawn-out combat missions.Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranManaging Director, Vet Voice FoundationIn light of the problem at NBC, maybe this is a good time for them to rethink their program models? Technology is and has changed just about every business -- maybe time for broadcast TV to rethink how it does its business, the news?Host, Fox News\u0027 \u0027On the Record With Greta Van Susteren\u0027The president\u0027s forceful messages recognize that the crisis at hand is about much more than one nation\u0027s membership in the EU, but rather about protecting a global economy still fragile from the effects of the financial crisis and ensuring the strength of the Western alliance in these times of increasing peril.Chairman, Financial Crisis Inquiry CommissionThe anti-Muslim sentiment in the United States isn\u0027t just rising, it\u0027s really high. An unwillingness and indifference on the part of individuals and institutions to put it in check is a large part of the problem.Executive Director and Chaplain, Islamic Center at New York UniversityBEIRUT -- ISIS\u0027 horrific immolation of a caged Lt. Muath Al-Kaseasbeh, the Jordanian pilot, will have been done in full understanding of the emotional impact of the manner of his death on Jordanians and in the West: This was very deliberate -- not some spur-of-the-moment act of barbarism. It is important to understand what lies behind and beyond the event itself.Fmr. MI-6 agent; Author, \u0027Resistance: The Essence of Islamic Revolution\u0027Why are so many girls, especially girls of color, confined in our nation\u0027s detention facilities, and what are we as a society going to do about it? We must all work tirelessly to give hope and a fair chance to these girls and all children by promoting policies, programs, and supports that help them and their families, especially those most at risk.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundAs a military mom, I believe it\u0027s our sacred duty to honor the service of those who have sacrificed for our country. We owe thanks today and every day to those who wear the uniform. That is one of the reasons why First Lady Michelle Obama and I started Joining Forces in the first place.Second Lady of the United StatesPresident Obama\u0027s proposal to repeal of the 2002 AUMF, which I have long fought for, is a positive sign, but we must address the root of the problem. Congress must repeal the 2001 AUMF, which allows any president to wage perpetual war, in any place and at any time.U.S. Representative, California\u0027s 13th congressional districtWhen it comes to the defining issues of our future, India will have a seat at the table.Fmr. three-term mayor of New York City; Founder of Bloomberg Philanthropies and Bloomberg LPDean Smith clearly touched many individual lives, but he also affected the world in which he lived. He was especially committed to fighting racial discrimination and wasn\u0027t afraid to speak out against the nuclear arms race, and he publicly opposed the death penalty -- all issues that didn\u0027t have great support in his environment.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersWe\u0027ve got the bad guys on the run. It\u0027s as if this week\u0027s been scripted as a buildup to the worldwide weekend of divestment festivities. And divestment is on a roll: Last week the New School, in the center of New York, and the oldest university in Australia joined the long and growing list.Author of a dozen books, including \u0027The End of Nature\u0027 and \u0027Deep Economy\u0027On Feb. 10, Jon Stewart announced that he would be retiring from \"The Daily Show\" after more than 15 years. It\u0027s hard to...Senior Editor, HuffPost WomenSince the end of the nineteenth century, the movement for a critical reflection on the foundations and interpretations of Islam has lost momentum, impeded by the predominance of a sclerotic, Arabo-centric Islam based on an obsolete worldview and often dismissive of non-Arab Muslims.Founder, The Atlantic DinnersFmr. Vice Prime Minister of Malaysia, head of the national opposition and chairman of the World Forum for Muslim DemocratsFounder, The Atlantic DinnersPresident of the World Conference for Religions for PeaceThe true State of the Union, and the state of the world, in 2015 can be described in one word: precarious. Despite our wealth, our technological knowhow, our global social media, we are a world at war with each other and with the planet itself.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia UniversityAs Israel\u0027s ambassador to the United Nations (UN), I have a front row seat to the world\u0027s foremost theater of the absurd. This fall, the UN will celebrate its 70thanniversary. In honor of New York\u0027s longest running production, I offer here a synopsis of the most recent drama and a special glimpse behind-the-scenes.Israel\u0027s ambassador to the United NationsOn 7 May Britain will vote in the most important General Election for a generation. But there is real doubt about whether the new generation of voters will have their say... This general election will have huge consequences for the young.Leader of the OppositionGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"CYBERHEIST",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
