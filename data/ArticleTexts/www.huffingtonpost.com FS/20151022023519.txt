{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Global Editorial DirectorThe Long Goodbye devolved into a waiting game in which the key and only question was: What’s he waiting for? And if Biden\u0027s heart really was never in it, then why, indeed, was he taking so long? The only possible explanation we can infer was that he was waiting for Clinton’s candidacy to implode. Biden\u0027s best buddy, President Barack Obama, praised him on “60 Minutes” recently as a great vice president, but declined to tout him as a unique presidential candidate. Now Biden has bowed out officially, but only after Clinton and Bernie Sanders performed well at their first debate. The departure looks, at least in part, like the result of naked political calculation. Which is not how Biden or his friends wanted him to exit the electoral stage.Votes over the CFPB present the same choice today that they always have -- a choice between big banks and predatory lenders on one side and families on the other. It\u0027s time to say no to the big banks and no to their lobbyists, their lawyers and their Republican friends in Congress.Democratic Senator from MassachusettsDonald Trump has opened the floodgates to lies about immigration. Here are the myths, and the facts.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027The events of 9/11 changed everything.

Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoLast Tuesday, five Democrats took the stage in the party\u0027s first national debate. There were differences no doubt. But what was striking was how much they agreed upon? -- ?if not in what they said, at least in what they ignored.Law professor, activist, candidate in the Democratic Primary for PresidentMany people who experience this strange haunting of suicidal thoughts are not depressed or mentally ill. We need to begin to ask the deeper, more probing questions behind their desperate, extreme acts.Jazz singer/songwriter; granddaughter of Norman RockwellWe should avoid the trap of seeing Russian involvement in Syria solely through the prism of our bilateral rivalry. The Russians can do things in ultimate furtherance of American policy aims that we cannot do ourselves.Former Director of the CIA Counter-Terrorism Center (2004 to 2006); Author of the forthcoming \u002788 Days to Kandahar\u0027Do you want your tax dollars to go to companies in countries like Brunei, where unmarried women who get pregnant are sent to prison and gays and lesbians are sentenced to death by stoning?President, National Organization for WomenAs part of his campaign to appear to be an honest broker within the party, Ryan has carefully cultivated the image of being a serious \"thinker\" and \"policy wonk\" and, for the most part, the mainstream media have taken the bait.E.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeIn replacing palm oil with coconut oil, are animal lovers encouraging the use of one ethically problematic tropical oil for another? The answer, tragically, is yes, as much of the coconut industry is built on the backs of monkeys; pig-tailed macaques to be exact.AuthorStarting today, three bills are being rammed through the Wisconsin legislature that will put the final nails in the coffin of our state\u0027s long history of clean elections and accountable governance. Who is asking for these bills? Now we know.The Center for Media and Democracy/ALEC ExposedGiven the nature of the show, it\u0027s meant to have disturbing moments, but using rape as a tool to be edgy makes the show problematic and, quite frankly, boring. Relying on rape is a trope that Murphy and Falchuk have used before in every incarnation of the \"American Horror Story\" franchise.Voices Editorial FellowThere exists a future of artificial intelligence, rampant inequality and irreversible climate change. But there is also a future of abundance, where technology and good public policy leads to a better life for everyone. If you had the chance to take us back to the future?--?to 2045?--?what future would you present?Founder, The ReadyAt a time when both left and right have begun to agree on the needless financial and human costs of mass incarceration, the State of Texas is conspiring with the Obama administration to undermine a federal court order so they can keep innocent children in prison.Executive Director, ACLU of Texas\"No fly zone\" \u003d \"make a stand against the Russians and Iranians.\" But presumably, \"Let\u0027s have a war with Russia and Iran\" didn\u0027t test well in Republicans\u0027 focus groups. \"No fly zone\" is a marketing euphemism for \"war.\"Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicyObama has \"DirectTV,\" Carson has \"cable,\" and apparently, the American people have no class. Just because these women have husbands that have chosen a life in the public eye, serving the public, does not make them fair game for sexist jokes and offensive comparison.| iowan | cyclone | grammar nerd | listener of audio books | feminist | political junkie | cat mom || farmer’s daughter | Gemini \u0026 real-life twinWith a lead in the polls, Thomas Mulcair fell victim to the Conservative definition of the NDP as fiscally irresponsible and led with a promise to balance the budget. After years of austerity measures, that rightward fiscal turn felt to many like a betrayal of NDP values in search of a few votes.Senior Editor, Huffington Post CanadaWhen I walked back into the bathroom of my recently purged and lonesome Brooklyn apartment and saw my intuition confirmed with the word \"pregnant\" in the window of the digital test, I didn\u0027t cry or panic. I sat down and called my mom and then my soon-to-be ex-husband to calmly tell them both that I would be scheduling an abortion for the next week.Graduate Student, Community Activist and WriterWhy do we think it\u0027s okay to call somebody \"fat\", \"stupid\" or \" ugly\" when we disagree with them just because we\u0027re doing it over the Internet? Why do we think it\u0027s okay to send people anonymous mean messages on websites like Tumblr just because we are not saying these words to their face?Disability rights activist, inclusive fashionista, grad student, and bloggerAll too often life insurance companies are unable to find the beneficiaries of a policy. If they fail to turn the money over to state unclaimed property departments and instead choose to sit on it, they are unjustly rewarded with the ability to continue profiting from the investment of someone who is now deceased.Syndicated Columnist, Longtime Political Strategist, Executive Director of Allied ProgressI was a 14-year-old high school freshman when I began collecting guns. It was Chicago in 1958, a time before a metal detector had ever darkened a school doorway. Disciplinary problems in most American classrooms meant kids sneaking out without a hall pass or sticking old Juicy Fruit under their desks.Award-winning documentary film-maker, writer, husband, father, devoted hugger of trees and grandchildren.In celebrating our technological advancements, it is important to remember that none of these innovations happened by chance.

Consider, however, not only the principles themselves -- for example, how to teach in a way that is more authentic, less standardized, and often messy -- but the broader issue of what educators believe and its relation to what actually happens in schools.Education expertFor many years, women artists and writers did their best to keep up with the guys. When the feminist movement came along, they resented being lumped into a category that defined them as \"women artists.\" Helen Frankenthaler, a painter who is having a seriously revitalized pop culture moment, was among those who also resisted this label.Culture Columnist, Huffington Post, CultureZohnWhen Justin Trudeau was elected in 2008 it was clear to everyone that he could never be destined for the backbenches.
