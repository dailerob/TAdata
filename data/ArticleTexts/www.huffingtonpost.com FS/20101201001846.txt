{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"The U.S. embassy cables released by WikiLeaks this weekend provide another opportunity to turn the spotlight on the war in Afghanistan, which, despite the fact that it\u0027s costing us $2.8 billion a week, keeps getting pushed into the shadows -- even in this deficit-obsessed time. The cables are a powerful reminder of what this unwinnable war is costing us in terms of lives, in terms of money, and in terms of our long-term national security. They don\u0027t deliver the punch in the gut the Afghanistan war logs WikiLeaks released in July did, with their disturbing accounts of killed civilians, dead children, confused soldiers, and mounting chaos. But the funny thing about tipping points is that you never know what fact, image, or story will bring things to a critical mass -- what small moment will cause a big idea to finally take hold.Read Post | CommentsDr. Mark Dybul and Michael Gerson, 12.01.2010Has putting AIDS first actually diverted resources from more urgent goals?

Hacker and Paul Pierson, 11.30.2010Authors, Winner-Take-All Politics: How Washington Made the Rich Richer—And Turned Its Back on the Middle ClassPerhaps the best that can be said about Obama\u0027s preemptive sacrifice to the deficit-reduction gods -- a two-year freeze on pay for non-military federal workers -- is that it represents small change. But the price isn\u0027t as small as the numbers suggest.Read Post | CommentsSen.
