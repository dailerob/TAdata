{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week brought the arrival of Op-Ed Diplomacy, as Presidents Putin and Obama (via the brilliant satiric brain of Albert Brooks) took to the New York Times and The Huffington Post respectively to address the ongoing crisis in Syria. Putin, speaking \"directly to the American people,\" extolled international law, made a case against a retaliatory U.S. strike and chided \"American exceptionalism,\" saying that \"God created us equal.\" (Except, of course, for gay people). \"Mr. Putin,\" Obama/Brooks responded, \"we put a man on the moon and you barely got a monkey home safely... It\u0027s one thing to put down exceptionalism, but before you do that, you at least have to produce one Broadway show, or make one commercial airliner, or invent one type of salad.\" Putin, \"Obama\" noted, cares so much for his people, rather than see them argue, he will \"graciously offer them the solace of prison.\" We\u0027ll happily publish President Putin\u0027s reply -- unless it\u0027s from Yakov Smirnoff.Comments (76)Wait But Whywww.waitbutwhy.comLucy is part of Generation Y, the generation born between the late 1970s and the mid 1990s. She\u0027s a unique brand of yuppie, one who thinks they are the main character of a very special story. Only issue is this one thing: Lucy\u0027s kind of unhappy.Comments (146)Albert BrooksActor, Writer, Filmmaker, Comedian, Author, 2030: The Real Story of What Happens To AmericaMr. Putin, it\u0027s one thing to put down exceptionalism, but before you do that, you at least have to produce one Broadway show, or make one commercial airliner, or invent one type of salad.Comments (2,212)Gary HartPresident, Hart International, Ltd.\"Often wrong, but never in doubt\" is a description of one kind of political mind. \"Occasionally wrong, but often in doubt\" is another. Applied to foreign policy, and especially the use of US military power, this formulation offers an insight into policy confusion over Syria.Comments (104)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027There are massive numbers of human lives involved here, plus a real danger of war engulfing the region and spreading out with weapons of mass destruction present -- yet all we can talk about is politics?Comments (190)Arianna HuffingtonEmpathy is a two-way street and is best nurtured by example. Philosophers have known this for centuries. \"No one can live happily who has regard for himself alone and transforms everything into a question of his own utility,\" wrote the first-century Stoic philosopher Seneca. And in practically every religious tradition and practice, giving of oneself is a key step on the path to spiritual fulfillment.Comments (168)George LakoffAuthor, \u0027The Political Mind,\u0027 \u0027Moral Politics\u0027 and \u0027Don\u0027t Think of an Elephant!\u0027The president\u0027s logic of limited bombing is not understood: he wants to bomb to prevent the systemic effect of the use of poison gas, not to stop the direct killing via other means, which we cannot stop.Comments (393)Anna NeistatAssociate Director, Program/Emergencies, Human Rights WatchIt\u0027s not what Vladimir Putin\u0027s New York Times op-ed says that\u0027s so worrisome; it\u0027s what it doesn\u0027t say. As a Russian and as someone who has been to Syria multiple times since the beginning of the conflict to investigate war crimes and other violations, I would like to mention a few things Putin overlooked.Comments (1,061)Kirk DouglasActorThere can never be forgiveness if we do not first admit our mistakes. Racism is a sin for which we have never atoned. It is a grave injustice that must be addressed before we can ever truly move forward as a nation. Apologies are not excuses, but they are a good start on the road to repentance.Comments (403)Melinda GatesCo-chair, the Bill and Melinda Gates FoundationI look forward to mid-September every year, to the day when UNICEF reports how many fewer children died the previous year. Every single year -- for at least the last 50 years -- the number has gone down. Every. Single. Year.Comments (109)Russell SimmonsFounder, GlobalGrind.comFor anyone to call Obama \"weak\" or a \"wimp\" because he is more confident in his words than the war machine, I would ask you to remember the mistake of Iraq. I applaud the president for his restraint.Comments (267)Diane RavitchHistorian, NYU professorWhat bothers Bloomberg is that de Blasio may well be his successor and has shown no deference to Bloomberg. In fact, he has been the mayor\u0027s sharpest critic. What an insult to Bloomberg!Comments (34)Oliver Stone and Peter KuznickWhitewashing the past is critical to perpetuating empire in the present -- a project in which the U.S. and Japan have collaborated for the past 68 years.Comments (282)Indra NooyiChairman and CEO, PepsiCoAre we spending adequate time and energy trying to understand women\u0027s specific needs? And are we designing our products and experiences to meet them?CommentsJosh SilverDirector, Represent.UsAs soon as Foreign Relations Committee members take money from the very companies that stand to make millions from military action, we the people can no longer be unequivocally sure that they are making decisions purely on the merits of what\u0027s best for our nation.Comments (234)Greta Van SusterenHost, Fox News\u0027 \u0027On the Record With Greta Van Susteren\u0027In about 1964 or 1965, President Johnson initiated the War on Poverty. He wanted to beat it. If you look at the numbers then to now, you know we have failed miserably. There could be no better proof than the numbers to convince us our strategy is wrong, dead wrong.Comments (209)James CostosU.S. Ambassador Designate to SpainI am deeply committed to furthering the economic and foreign policies of the country we love.Comments (16)Terrell ThomasCornerback, New York GiantsI want to bring to you the story of an athlete, one who has endured a great amount of adversity both during and after football season. I am Terrell Thomas, and I hope that this blog gives you great insight into my life and career.Comments (16)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarMany children who grow up \"having it all\" find themselves burdened by a notorious surname, being recognized by nearly everyone as \"so-and-so\u0027s child.\" And when that parent is in the news -- observed, scrutinized -- so, too, is the child.CommentsWilliam BaldwinActorApollo, Poseidon, Zeus... all the Gods are smiling down from the heavens as a result of the IOC\u0027s decision to reinstate wrestling back into the Olympic Games.CommentsSec. Kathleen SebeliusSecretary of Health and Human ServicesPresident Obama and the entire Obama administration have made prevention and public health a top priority because of the lasting effects they have on the health of Americans.Comments (63)Alan ColmesLiberal political commentator, host of \"The Alan Colmes Show\" on Fox News Radio, publisher of alan.com, author of \"Thank the Liberals … For Saving America\"Dignified and respectful quietude speaks much louder than pomp and circumstance when it comes to remembering those who died. \"Never forget\" is correct. But the place to remember is in our hearts, not in lavish ceremonies.Comments (230)Sen. Bernie SandersIndependent U.S. Senator from VermontWith a loud and clear voice, the overwhelming majority of the American people, across the political spectrum, are saying NO to another war in the Middle East -- Syria\u0027s bloody and complicated civil war.Comments (548)Rachel Macy StaffordCertified special education teacher and authorVery rarely does one sentence have immediate impact on me. Very rarely does one sentence change the way I interact with my family. But this one did.Comments (161)Conrad BlackAuthor and HistorianAs I was contemplating whether the descendants of those who elevated some of modern history\u0027s greatest statesmen to America\u0027s highest public offices had become a nation of obtuse dolts, a Damascene bolt of reassurance came through my car radio: Eliot Spitzer lost his race for comptroller of New York City. The United States re-elected an inadequate president but its largest city has held the red line on someone manifestly unfit for public office.Comments (84)Rep. Tulsi GabbardU.S. Representative from Hawaii\u0027s Second Congressional DistrictI have concluded that intervention in Syria goes against America\u0027s national security, international credibility, economic interest, and moral center.Comments (179)Harvey FiersteinMultiple Tony-Award-winning actorWhat makes Putin\u0027s war on homosexuals so frightening is that the methodology is perfectly simple. His recipe is time-tested and depends, almost entirely, on the most dependable truth of all -- human nature.Comments (269)Anas Aremeyaw AnasUndercover journalist and private eyeIn my TEDTalk, I tell the full story of how it all started. I look back on over 14 years of my undercover reporting. There have been high and low points, but one thing that remains is the kind of impact this kind of journalism brings.Comments (134)Lauren DucaEditorial Fellow, The Huffington PostMeet Jessica \"Biel\" Timberlake. You may know her as the teenage girl who starred as Mary Camden-Rivera on 7th Heaven or maybe you\u0027re more familiar with that person who married Justin Timberlake.Comments (194)Dennis J. KucinichFmr. 16-year Member of US Congress; Two-time US Presidential CandidateWe\u0027ve seen this movie before and it doesn\u0027t end well. A decade after the Bush administration used the CIA\u0027s \"yellow cake\" tale and other faulty evidence, the government is yet again relying on the CIA to lead a domestic propaganda effort for military action in Syria.Comments (468)Jeffrey SachsDirector, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \"To Move the World: JFK\u0027s Quest for Peace\"\"There\u0027s always some son-of-a-b**ch who doesn\u0027t get the word,\" John F. Kennedy exclaimed in frustration. The president and his advisors were huddled at the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, with the United States and the Soviet Union on the brink of nuclear war.Comments (18)Stephanie Vaughn Hapke, 2013.15.09Arzu Kaya Uranli, 2013.15.09Tina Wells, 2013.15.09Raymond J.
