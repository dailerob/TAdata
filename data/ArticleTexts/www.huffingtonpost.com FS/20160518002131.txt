{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteDespite expressing doubts about America\u0027s relationship with Saudi Arabia, President Barack Obama recently flew to Riyadh. Yet again he sought to \"reassure\" the Saudi royals about U.S. support. In fact, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia raises the question: What are allies for? If the president wants to leave his mark on American foreign policy, he should put distance between America and its most counterproductive partners. Riyadh would be a good place to start. After all, he rightly criticized the Kingdom as among the many \"free riders\" on U.S. security guarantees. Washington and Saudi Arabia should move to a more normal relationship. There no longer need be the pretense of intimate political friendship.Universal tax credits for every American meet the demands of Republicans who want lower taxes and less government bureaucracy and the demands of Democrats who want to reinforce the social safety net.Interested in how technology changes how we live and and how to use it to make our lives better and our world more justI made The War Comes Home, a new documentary, because I want everyone to see how our veterans live with PTS and the novel approaches being taken to address their pain and, sometimes, suicidal or homicidal thoughts.Journalist; Founder, Starfish Media GroupShe is as fit to be president as Trump is not. The gap is daunting -- the wrong result would be dangerous to America and the world.

Public health advocates are calling on soda makers to stop targeting our children and to stop targeting minorities. They are calling on celebrities to stop selling out to the industry and using their fame to peddle an unhealthy habit to their fans.CEO, American Heart AssociationMany people might think that Donald Trump can only teach the country how to offend women, African Americans, and a range of non-European ethnic groups. While that may be his area of expertise, it seems that his rants on dealing with debt may actually provide a teachable moment.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027When it comes to issues the American people agree on, few have as much support as solar and wind power.

Could it be financial support for causes conservatives hate? Could it be an evasion of taxes? It\u0027s highly unlikely that Trump would try too hard to hide any of those things.Public Relations Consultant, www.winningprogressive.comA commencement speech provides no space for direct, democratic engagement. The speaker arrives, receives an honorary degree, delivers their remarks, and leaves. There is no room for free speech since the event is one-directional.Rutgers and Stanford Grad. Chief of Staff at MuslimGirl.com. Writer.Congressman Peter King dropped a bomb when he referred to Japanese as \"Japs\" on MSNBC\u0027s Morning Joe. King brushed off the ensuing uproar over the use of the racial slur by stating that \"we\u0027re getting too politically correct\" and \"oversensitive.\"Civil rights leader, Executive Director of the Japanese American Citizens League, author of first Japanese American redress bill in nation.We\u0027re really in the home stretch of the Democratic primaries now, as the last few territories and the last eight states will all be voting in the upcoming weeks. Tuesday night, Oregon and Kentucky will weigh in, and then the last six states (who, for some unfathomable reason, all decided to go last this year) will finally get a chance to vote.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comIt goes without saying that in a democracy everyone is entitled to his or her own opinions. The trouble starts when people think they are also entitled to their own facts. On the hundreds of millions of acres of public lands that most Americans take for granted, the trouble is deep, and won\u0027t soon go away.Author, A Great Aridness: Climate Change and the Future of the SouthwestIt\u0027s easy to determine if you\u0027re a feminist: You believe in the legal and social equality of men and women. The confusion usually falls within the social definition because it\u0027s left to personal interpretation: paying for dates, shaving armpits and legs, wearing make-up and a myriad of other nuances.Author of American Woman: The Poll Dance, Media Director for We Are WomanDilma, contrary to everything that some people expect of a woman, did not cry, did not lose her temper, did not throw a fit.

Yet, despite the groundswell of interest in Mars, some have argued that we don\u0027t have a mandate for humans to go to Mars any time soon. Are these skeptics correct?CEO, Explore MarsDirector of Political Outreach for Explore Mars.A man who, with the nomination in his grasp, showed that his idea of a credible source is the National Enquirer, and that his idea of ethical boundaries is to smear his opponent\u0027s father -- that guy could have his finger on the button of our nuclear arsenal.Science and Religion Correspondent for the Humanist MagazineIt\u0027s seemingly impossible to engage in a candid discussion about \"flickin\u0027 the bean,\" even from girlfriends who are quick to talk about their explicit escapades.
