{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Counsel, Human Rights First\u0027s Law and Security ProgramToday marks 11 years since terrorists attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September 11, 2001. It was the worst terrorist attack ever on U.S. soil, and it changed completely the way the U.S. government responds to terrorist threats. In some ways, that\u0027s a good thing. After all, U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies were so disjointed and poorly managed that they missed clear warnings that could have prevented the deaths of more than 3,000 people. It was important to fix that. But fixing the real problem isn\u0027t how things happen in politics. Much of that response to the 9/11 attacks wasn\u0027t only unnecessary, it was downright destructive. Spending trillions on secret wars, secret trials, offshore prisons and forever prisoners? There\u0027s no future in that.Read Post | Comments (232)Tim Armstrong, 09/11/12Chairman and CEO of AOLIn a matter of minutes and hours, an act that was meant to freeze the country and our freedom, led to an outpouring of immediate action.

Yes the outcomes of their actions involve collateral damage and unintended consequences. But they see all this as preferable to the alternative of doing nothing.Read Post | CommentsBob Graham and Sharon Premoli, 09/11/12Despite the carefully orchestrated campaign to protect our Saudi \"friends,\" ample evidence of Saudi Arabia\u0027s intimate ties to al-Qaeda and the 9/11 attacks has come to light.Read Post | Comments (100)Abraham R. Wagner, 09/11/12School of International \u0026 Public Affairs, Columbia UniversityTaking stock on the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, we can clearly see numerous examples of places where the investment in the science and technology base has enabled more effective counter-terrorism operations.Read Post | CommentsMichael Smerconish, 09/11/12Radio hostAt dinner tables across America, tonight needs to be a time for parents to share with their children the perspective of where they were 11 years ago, what happened to the nation and with what consequence.

Haass, 09/11/12President, Council on Foreign RelationsWhat 9/11 shows us is that while terrorists can destroy, they are unable to create. They are not the inspiration behind the upheavals in the Arab world. Terrorists offer no alternative, only violence.Read Post | Comments (11)Lawrence Lessig, 09/11/12Author, \u0027Republic, Lost\u0027; Founder, RootstrikersWhat reformers need is a Congress without conflict: Members who could not benefit from the bonus of being a lobbyist, and thus who could vote honestly and fairly about any proposals for reform.

Many argue it\u0027s an image we don\u0027t want to imagine. Yet gruesome as resulting imagery could have been, the benefits of having social media on that day may have been profound.Read Post | Comments (21)Peter Van Buren, 09/11/12Fmr.
