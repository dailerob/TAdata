{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Since the recession began, we\u0027ve lost over 2 million manufacturing jobs, the kind of jobs that have traditionally delivered American families into the middle class -- and kept them there. Yet the loss of middle class jobs is rarely talked about in Washington. Neither is the way that the useful section of our economy is being replaced by the useless section of our economy. But the numbers don\u0027t lie: the share of our economy devoted to making things of value is shrinking, while the share devoted to valuing made up things (credit swap derivatives, anyone?) is expanding. And it\u0027s not just manufacturing jobs that are disappearing. Hundreds of thousands of well-paying white-collar jobs are also now being shipped overseas. Do you hear that? It\u0027s Ross Perot\u0027s giant sucking sound being cranked up to a deafening roar -- and it\u0027s about a lot more than NAFTA.Read Post | CommentsTimothy Geithner, Arne Duncan and Valerie Jarrett, 04.27.2010Beyond financial reform, we must encourage all Americans -- especially our youth -- to cultivate adequate individual financial literacy to succeed in this increasingly complex, fast-moving economy.Read Post | CommentsSen.
