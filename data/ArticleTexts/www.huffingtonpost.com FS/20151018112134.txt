{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, Democrats held their first presidential debate, bringing a fresh onslaught of insta-polls and horse-race analysis. No matter who won, it\u0027s clear Americans are losing faith in the ability of our national leaders to solve our biggest challenges. But take heart, because those challenges are in fact being met - in our cities. I\u0027m seeing this first-hand here in London, where I\u0027m moderating a panel at CityLab, an event put together by Bloomberg Philanthropies, The Aspen Institute, and The Atlantic that brings together mayors from around the world to share ideas and spread solutions. Today, we\u0027ll hear how New Orleans used advanced software to greatly reduce urban blight, how Bristol partnered with local tech entrepreneurs to help meet its environmental goals, and how Seoul used big data to make its public transportation system more efficient. So as we watch our presidential candidates vie for the right to lead a paralyzed system - remember that creativity, risk-taking, and innovation are being brought to bear on some of the world\u0027s most vexing problems in those local laboratories of democracy: cities.The government wants the world to believe that the Maldives is a nascent democracy and a tourist paradise. But despite its expensive PR strategies, the world is not fooled.LawyerThis week, I sent a letter to Donald Trump\u0027s campaign asking to not use my music at political rallies. My intent was not to make a political statement, but to make one about the rights of my fellow music creators. Now is the time to show us some love by supporting the effort to reform outdated copyright laws.Singer-songwriter and frontman of AerosmithIn scores of countries around the world LGBT people are at a real risk of being discriminated against because of who they are. That is not acceptable for LGBT people living in those countries, but it is also not acceptable for LGBT people in this country.U.S. Permanent Representative to the United NationsThe quality of the questions was higher than has been the case with other debate spectacles in recent years. Yet CNN\u0027s self-censorship - in part reflected in the content of the questions and the favored positioning given to Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders - was not obscured.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorSports takes you out of the skinny girl mentality, out of the sexual object category, and allows you to embrace yourself without self-consciousness and own who you are. That does not make us less of a woman. It makes us more.Actress and authorAs a society, we may feel safer by believing the threat of violence can be ascribed to one group of people. Like human nature, however, the truth is more complicated.NFL wide receiver; Co-founder, PROJECT 375Obama should consent to a full, independent, impartial investigation of the hospital bombing by IHFFC. If that investigation shows that war crimes probably occurred, appropriate prosecutions of the U.S. chain of command should ensue.Professor, Thomas Jefferson School of LawClinton is the most experienced and prepared candidate for the presidency in memory. But how plausible is it to believe that her experience and tenacity can enable her to work with Republicans to effect the change we need?President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureWho is writing and influencing the history our children are taught? Should a few education officials in Texas or any state drive decisions about what all of our children learn or sugarcoat the truth?President, Children\u0027s Defense FundIn a world so divided by mounting political tensions and a vicious cycle of violence, we need the United Nations more than ever, and can no longer arrogantly push it aside for partisan interests. The consequences of trying to do so will eventually affect us all.Former President, East Timor, 1996 Nobel Peace Prize laureateIn the hell of bad solutions on offer for Syria, some are worse than others. And the one devised by Russian President Vladimir Putin is probably the most infernal of all.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.Justice will come when we demand truth and reinvestment. An acknowledgement that people of color are brutalized, criminalized, and incarcerated because of hundreds of years of racist policies that have involved forced labor, segregation, disparate opportunity, and organized state violence against black and brown people.Los Angeles-based artist, organizer, and freedom fighter. Co-founder of #BlackLivesMatterThe opportunity and ability to turn one\u0027s life around is a fundamental principle of justice and of the American Dream. Unfortunately, it seems this principle of American values has gone missing from our broken justice system. Fixing the way inmates interact with the outside world is an important step in restoring it.U.S. Senator for New JerseyCommissioner, Federal Communications CommissionA radical break with the past is the only way to provide the families of the Ankara massacre victims with the answers they deserve. The current state can\u0027t properly and convincingly investigate the political murders committed against its citizens. Only a truly new Turkey, based on pluralistic citizenship, can.Turkey expert and Kurdistan correspondentThe Select Committee has become the longest and one of the least active congressional investigations in history. It has held only three hearings in more than sixteen months. It has spent approximately 4.7 million taxpayer dollars.Dean of the US House of Representatives | Ranking Member, House Judiciary CommitteeFirst came Fallujah, then Mosul, and later Ramadi in Iraq. Now, there is Kunduz, a provincial capital in northern Afghanistan. Together, these setbacks have rendered a verdict on the now more-or-less nameless Global War on Terrorism.Author, \u0027The Limits of Power: The End of American Exceptionalism\u0027These people, who could easily be you and me, have been forced to flee their homes in order to survive. The least we can do is educate ourselves about what\u0027s really going on, report their stories accurately, and treat them with dignity and respect.Actor and ProducerDays ago, U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew asked whether our nation would \"muster the political will to avoid the self-inflicted wounds that come from a political stalemate.\" It\u0027s a fair question.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027The death penalty is an unusually cruel and inhumane form of punishment. It also demonstrably fails to deter crime, drug-related or otherwise. Countries carrying out executions for drug offenses simply do not register significant shifts in either supply or demand.Former minister of Social Affairs and former president of the Swiss ConfederationIn addition to the rejectionist, veto caucus, I will also call these guys the \"white-washed caucus.\" As white-washed elected officials from white-washed districts, they want to keep America white, or white-controlled, for as long as they possibly can.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersLet\u0027s fill the gap between expectations and reality by showing that workplace equality is both possible and a priority, and ensure that women are fully empowered to press for change and unleash their potential.President of The Rockefeller FoundationCEO, Thomson Reuters FoundationIf the first Democratic primary debate of the 2016 cycle showed us anything, it is the value of experience -- experience in politics, certainly, but also experience in the art of political communication.Professor of Journalism, Northeastern University, BostonIn Georgia, we have been victorious in deterring powerful outsider groups from interfering in our local politics and stopping important legislation.

A story of Palestine. A story of refugees, of military occupation and torture, of political imprisonment, of women\u0027s rights organizing, of freedom.

No one is free until everyone is free from oppression.Distinguished Professor of Africana Studies at Morehouse CollegeMany people charged with illegal reentry are like my father - people who have lived in the US for years and who are desperate to return to the US to be with their families.Third-year law student at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, CaliforniaAll of my black friends have been told at some point or another during their lifetime that they \"talk white.\" The person who says it likely doesn\u0027t know many black people. Black people are generally seen as uneducated thugs. I do not appear to be an uneducated thug. Therefore, I must talk white.Actor, writer, director and hand-talkerThe debate highlighted just how important it is to pressure candidates to focus on the issues progressives care about.
