{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"United States Senator (Ret.)Campaigns cost money, a lot of money. Big donors, including now -- thanks to the U.S. Supreme Court -- giant corporations who can make huge contributions to promote their corporate interests, set the national agenda and reap their rewards. James Madison is restless in his grave. Given this circumstance, who is best positioned to win the Money Primary but candidates who have built or inherited national financial networks over decades. That is why political pundits and odds-makers have narrowed the presidential campaign to two candidates, both of whom meet this qualification. Most people accept this with a shrug. What can you do? It is what it is. Except, it is wrong and it is poisonous to our Republic.The new Greek government needs support in establishing pro-growth policies which create jobs, expand their economy and enable them to pay down their debts. Demanding that creditors are paid before any of that is allowed to happen may come at a very heavy price for more than just the people of Greece.Independent U.S. Senator from VermontWe are at a place in time when fellow artists can raise one another up and sponsor one another into an age of creative freedom. And in the future ahead, what we have to look forward to, as a community, is a new wave of creative expression.Members of the group TLCAfter the murderous attacks in Paris and Copenhagen, one might wonder whether a newspaper that published the Charlie Hebdo cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad in the United States would be protected by the First Amendment. The government might make two primary arguments in support of a law prohibiting the publication of the cartoons.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoBeing a feminist does not provide a \"get out of racism free\" card, and that is the card Iggy has been playing over and over since her rise to fame, which a lot of folks seem to have a whole deck of, from dismissive reactions to Susan B. Anthony\u0027s racism to flippancy regarding Madonna\u0027s use of the N-word.Poet, author, and activistShould the federal government task teachers, religious leaders, and mental health professionals with rating and reporting to law enforcement about the strength of a family\u0027s parent-child bond? A child\u0027s involvement in religious activities or his connection to a group identity? Whether there are \"ideologues\" within an American community or what its level of \"cohesiveness\" is?Director, ACLU’s National Security ProjectPersonal satisfaction and serving others does go hand-in-hand. The general hopelessness about relationships and life I previously felt was like a sickness in my soul. Doing random acts of kindness is a giddy remedy I would recommend to anyone for these reasons.Blog Editor, The Huffington PostIt\u0027s a safe bet that you should always start with the United States census when you\u0027re beginning the search for an American ancestor. The federal census, which actually was first taken in our young Republic in 1790 and then every ten years after that, can give you the nuts and bolts you need to start a more extensive search.Alphonse Fletcher University Professor and Director of the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research at Harvard UniversityFamily Historian at Ancestry.comIn sum, we, the people, are ever less in control of anything. The police are increasingly not \"ours,\" nor are the NSA and its colleague outfits \"our\" intelligence agencies, nor are the wars we are fighting \"our\" wars, nor the elections in which we vote \"our\" elections.Editor, TomDispatch.comAmerica is the land of breakthrough science -- and health care scams. There is no question that Solvadi is a lifesaver for millions of Americans infected by Hepatitis C. Yet Solvadi is also the poster child of a U.S. health care system that is being bankrupted by greed, lobbying and indefensible policies on drug pricing.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia UniversityWe aren\u0027t here to judge -- and we have seen and heard worse, I promise. Please, tell the truth. I can\u0027t take care of your child (or you) if you don\u0027t.Pediatrician, Boston Children\u0027s Hospital, Harvard Medical SchoolThis year, many people are upset that Ava DuVernay, director of Selma, was snubbed, calling it racism... but the film itself was nominated. Is it racist to nominate the film but not the director? The bigger question is, does racism play a part in determining who gets nominated and who doesn\u0027t?ActorAs a gift for Putin\u0027s 58th birthday, twelve female students and alumni of Moscow State University\u0027s prestigious journalism department published a calendar featuring photos of themselves in lingerie, each woman suggesting herself as a potential lover for Putin.Author of Sex, Politics, and Putin: Political Legitimacy in RussiaI\u0027ve seen first-hand how effective Wall Street and big corporations are at wielding influence. Global deals like the Trans Pacific Partnership will boost the profits of Wall Street and big corporations, and make the richest 1 percent even richer. But they\u0027ll bust the rest of America.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027I believe that there is no better choice than to help the Kurds help us vanquish the unparalleled barbarity of the beheaders of the Islamic State. So, yes, weapons. An alliance without reservations or hidden agendas. Perhaps even a major \"Erbil conference.\"Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.The drug czar\u0027s office has long functioned as a cheerleader for punitive drug policies. However, under the Obama administration, the drug czar\u0027s office has made a notable shift in rhetoric and tone.Policy manager with the Drug Policy AllianceFor several days now, I\u0027ve been struggling to understand why I\u0027m so out of the loop on this one. It\u0027s not because I don\u0027t like experimental films or Richard Linklater. I didn\u0027t like Boyhood because it wasted my time with mostly unlikable characters, generally bad storytelling, and a whole lot of nothing.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027The anti-vax movement does show that even when the government isn\u0027t corrupt, when it appears to be, it has dire consequences.Author, Campaign Finance Activist, Marcom ConsultantWhen almost everyone who decides which movies get made are men, and men are the ones writing and directing all of the stories, even stories supposedly about women, we women lose sight of what it looks, feels and sounds like to have our stories told from our perspective.Author, \u0027Happiness as a Second Language\u0027The Economist\u0027s Feb. 6 cover displayed the Venus de Milo statue pointing a revolver, with the headline \"Go ahead, Angela, make my day.\" In the editors\u0027 upside-down world, Greece is threatening Europe, or at least Germany. Really?Co-director, Center for Economic and Policy Research, Washington, D.C.A fish-out-of-water story about a family trying to fit in and run a successful business hardly sounds like anything new. But the fact that the family in question is Asian American in a show where race and cultural differences are unapologetically (and hilariously) omnipresent makes FOTB a true gamechanger.Gentleman farmer, film critic for ReThink ReviewsHollywood isn\u0027t the only endeavor whose principals, as Pascal described its stars, can be \"bottomless pits of need.\" Politics comes to mind, as well as Wall Street, Silicon Valley, the media, academia, organized religion and that bedrock of civilization, the family.USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorSo while many women are able to get the birth control that\u0027s right for them, with small or no co-pays, too many are still like Alice after her fall in Carroll\u0027s first chapter -- lying on one side, peering through a keyhole into a garden of treasures she couldn\u0027t quite get to.Pulitzer Prize-winning journalistFor several weeks now, GOP congressman Aaron Schock has been at the center of negative media attention because of things he is alleged to be hiding, inspiring ethics complaints. But the one thing reporters are not talking about openly -- yet appear to be wink-winking and nudge-nudging about -- is the question of Schock\u0027s sexual orientation. This is glaring and curious.Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesIt\u0027s having a farm to call your own, a farmer to learn from and a place to go if you want to get into the dirt. It transforms the way you think about a rain on a summer\u0027s day - it\u0027s good for the crops.CEO, Great PerformancesStop the foolishness and talk to us like grownups.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorOutnumbering physicians six to one, nurses spend more time with patients and in many ways they are the heart of American health care. And with medical insurance now expanded to cover millions of new patients, the pressure on nurses is growing.Host of the public radio series “Humankind”While many conservatives are happy to see him leave the show he created, the truth is that all Stewart\u0027s done is dare to look at Michele Bachmann from the vantage point of a sane person. In doing so, we laugh because changing \"French fries\" to \"freedom Fries\" is funny.Columnist, journalist, and author published in The Hill\u0027s Congress Blog, The Jerusalem Post, Salon.com, and other publicationsRepublicans feared that trying to pay for their tax cuts by shifting to the highly uncertain dynamic scoring may not be enough. So they are further trying to rig the system with baseline games and make permanent tax provisions outside tax reform.Sandy Levin is the Ranking Member of the House Ways and Means CommitteeAs the countdown to full federal marriage equality marches towards late June, increasing numbers of gay and trans activists are asking and discussing, \"What\u0027s next?\" But while we\u0027re debating the issues, the opposition has already begun, and the backlash is picking up steam.Executive Director, Gender Rights MarylandLast week, the news profession lost three of its leading lights -- Bob Simon and David Carr to sudden and unexpected death and Brian Williams to a six-month suspension.
