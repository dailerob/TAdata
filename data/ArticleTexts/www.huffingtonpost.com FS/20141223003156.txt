{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Executive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostI\u0027m one of the millions of New Yorkers who woke up heartbroken today thinking of NYPD officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos who were shot dead yesterday while sitting in their car in Brooklyn by Ismaaiyl Brinsley. As the news unfolded, we learned the briefest details of the two men\u0027s lives such as the fact that Liu was married just two months ago, and that Ramos has a wife and a 13-year-old son who \"couldn\u0027t comprehend what had happened to his father\", according to NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio who met with the families before a press conference last night. I offered prayers for the men, and their widows and son. Liu and Ramos were not the only victims of Brinsley\u0027s deadly rampage yesterday. Earlier that day, the Atlanta resident had allegedly shot his former girlfriend in Maryland, who apparently now is in \"serious condition\". After killing the two police officers, Brinsley fled and apparently killed himself in a nearby subway station. The assassinations come at a particularly tense moment in America.It has been an especially good time over the past month watching President Obama give the congressional Republicans exactly what they asked for when they decided to oppose everything he did. But it\u0027s time to complete the trifecta: raise overtime pay for American workers.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027For me, Christmas is a reading, restful time and I like particularly to read a book that sweeps me into a complete world, somewhere else. It may be a true somewhere else, but it should be far from our own every day. That is precisely what The Queen of Four Kingdoms will do.Writer and creator, \u0027Downton Abbey\u0027I pray for unity in the city, as pain runs deep in many communities. But, we will no longer tolerate those, like Pat Lynch, who want to create more pain by attempting to divide the people and those who have taken an oath to protect and serve them.Founder, GlobalGrind.comFrom the report on torture we can draw three lessons. The first is a terrible one, but the other two are encouraging. The first thing the report teaches us is that it is possible for the most prominent intelligence agency of the world\u0027s most powerful democracy to commit torture on a large scale.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.Two weeks before Charles Schumer once again delivered for Wall Street with the omnibus budget deal, he gave a major speech in which he sounded like a progressive champion. He embodies the contradictions that will tear the Democratic Party apart over the next two years.Senior Fellow, Roosevelt Institute; author of \u0027Fighting for Our Health\u0027In this interview, he explores the work of Thomas Piketty and the need for the field of economics -- and the country -- to come to terms with the growing gulf between haves and have-nots.Author and cultural theoristWhat we need in the United States is not division; what we need is not hatred; what we need is not violence and lawlessness, but is love, and wisdom, and compassion toward one another, and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversitySome political events mark their importance less by their content than by their timing, circumstances and presentation. That is the case for the Senate Intelligence Committee\u0027s report on CIA torture. It contains little new to the attentive observer and none of that is of major consequence.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghConsider this: The federal government could, without any new laws, significantly restrict both the supply of, and demand for, fossil fuels. Only the state has the power to euthanize the fossil fuel industry. If the climate movement is serious about controlling Big Carbon it needs to get serious about Big Government.Contributing editor, The NationGet up off that fainting couch. You\u0027re about to become the Banksy of winter footwear.WriterAt the group\u0027s most recent conference, held earlier this month in Washington, D.C., more than 400 predominantly Republican state lawmakers and industry reps formulated sample legislation that will serve as templates for statehouses across the country.Senior Writer, Union of Concerned ScientistsWhether it\u0027s dining out, going to a holiday party, or seeing treats everywhere, from the office to the candy jar at your favorite store, the holiday season really puts our willpower to the test.Nationally-recognized nutritionist; International Speaker; Adjunct professor of nutrition at NYU; Author, \u0027The Portion Teller Plan\u0027Sure, one of these years I\u0027d love to have iPads, televisions, bikes, and the like under the tree, but I can say without any reservation that even though we don\u0027t have money, I have never gone to bed on Christmas night feeling poor.Blogger, Simple Simon and CompanyFor humans to flourish, we must grow intellectually, spiritually and emotionally. Through a myriad of educational and cultural opportunities, the avenues for self-growth and societal contribution seem endless. Why then does a sports entertainment culture that seems mindless dominate so much of the average American\u0027s time and commitment?Educator, Activist and WriterAnxieties and tempers are high. Seemingly simple messages are loaded with the weight of the world (or, at least the weight of family baggage from decades past). People are on edge. And relationships that are challenging at all -- and those are often the ones you\u0027ve had most of your life -- can become downright unbearable this time of year.Relationship advice columnist at DearWendy.comWe have to start imagining a new reality -- this will mean fewer police and more social workers and teachers. This will mean creating more economic possibilities and investment that preserves and does not displace our communities. This will mean confronting decades of disinvestment in our communities.Executive Director of the Black Alliance for Just Immigration, Co-Founder of Black Lives MatterImmigration, global warming, Cuba, Keystone, with much more to come. For the Left, it comes as a kind of relief. For the Right, the gauntlet has been thrown down and the fight has begun.Senior Fellow, DemosAs we end another year of endless war in Washington, it might be the perfect time to reflect on the War That Started All Wars -- or at least the war that started all of Washington\u0027s post-Cold War wars: the invasion of Panama.Professor of History, New York UniversityI thought it was gross when a boy left his candy cane stuck in my beard, but my definition of gross has been redefined by this new kid who is eating it.Three-time parent, humorist, blogger of funny parenting stuff at www.ParentNormal.com.According to a recently released report from the nonprofit organization China Labor Watch (CLW), many popular toy brands are manufactured in Chinese factories that have been found to have repeatedly committed a vast number of worker rights violations.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorYou might be surprised at how much of the 7-Secret advice is counter to how people live and work. In truth, the frenetic, distracted way we live in 21st century America is not conducive to good brain health or performance.Cognitive neuroscientist; Founder and Chief Director, Center for BrainHealth, University of Texas at DallasPolice officers are now poised to treat pretty much anyone as a potential assailant. Already, chiefs and sheriffs around the country are creating new policies, and urging their officers to become extra vigilant.34-year veteran police officer who retired as Seattle\u0027s chief of police in 2000In 2013 our annual list included a story about a female celeb\u0027s face, an attack on Black masculinity, the delegitimizing of female politicians, and a Rolling Stone bomb. Remarkably, our 2014 list includes much of the same!Author of American Circumstance and Fiction as Research PracticeAs long as one grants that the United States\u0027 security requires that the state be able to keep some secrets, the question stands: should there be some limitations on the freedom of the press and who and how will determine what these ought to be?Professor of international relations, George Washington UniversityThe vibrant public response to these police killings is heartening. We are taking to the streets, and rightly so. But where are our protests heading? What should we demand that adequately addresses this destruction of life and hope?Author, \"How to Make a Million Dollars an Hour\" (Wiley 2013)Our overarching challenge as people who care about sports and the young people involved in them is to confront and overcome the win-at-all-costs (WAAC) and profit-at-all-costs (PAAC) mentalities that are resulting in a variety of insidious abuses in our little leagues and high schools.Sports Policy Director, League of FansShrum and Lowry discuss North Korea\u0027s film fatwa and Cheney\u0027s eagerness to become Mr. Torture. Then: If Nixon recognized China 25 years after its Communist Revolution, why shouldn\u0027t Obama do so with Cuba 50 years later? And can the third Bush beat the first woman?I find it hard to believe at first because I don\u0027t feel any different. But then days go by and I begin to feel a buzz around my edges. I realize that I, through no conscious effort of my own, am slowly building another person. My husband and I compare bellies in the mirror every night. I didn\u0027t think it was possible, but I enjoy being pregnant.Founder, Story ClubThe story is as old as the tale of Moses but to see it repeated and repeated is shocking - the deliberate killing of children for political or religious reasons.Veteran journalist reporting from the United NationsWhen we asked citizens in Egypt, Tunisia, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and UAE whether they believed the Middle East was better off or worse off as a result of the Arab Spring the responses were largely divided.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"MAYOR PLEADS FOR UNITY",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
