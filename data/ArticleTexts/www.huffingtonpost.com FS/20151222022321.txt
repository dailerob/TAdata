{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Fellow, DemosThere\u0027s a mini-groundswell saying Bernie\u0027s done because the campaign has moved away from domestic economic issues to national security. But it\u0027s a long campaign and history teaches that \"it\u0027s the economy, stupid.\" Bernie is by no means done. What Bernie can\u0027t control is the growing sense among Democratic voters that the core decision is which candidate can most likely win a general election. Republicans are so extreme and so scary that Dem voters want the candidate who will run the strongest in 2016. It\u0027s a profound and sensible place to be. The differences between any Dem and any Republican are so deep and so important that a little defensive politics may be smart. The lesson of Nader as spoiler in 2000 has not been forgotten.The 20D vote has thus opened the door to no less than three extremely complex and uncertain scenarios. The only certainty about this election is that the country broke with its past.Editorial Director, El Huffington PostWhy can\u0027t we just admit that BB-8 is adorable, Finn is hilarious, Rey is badass, seeing Han and Chewie again was awesome, the special effects were tremendous, Poe is Soloesque, Kylo Ren is intriguing -- and this movie makes absolutely no sense whatsoever?Assistant Professor of English at University of New Hampshire; Series Co-Editor, Best American Experimental WritingAs a member of Congress and the head of a social security advocacy group, we believe that it\u0027s time to take action to ensure that seniors, veterans, workers who have been forced to stop work as the result of serious and permanent disabilities, and others receive a badly needed raise.Founding Co-director, Social Security WorksU.S. Representative from Illinois\u0027 8th Congressional DistrictJust when I thought that one day, as a person with a vagina, I may (hypothetically-speaking), be able to become president... there was Saturday night\u0027s Democratic debate on ABC.Australian writer living in New York City. Producer at ScIQ on TYT Network (www.youtube.com/sciq)One thing is clear, the force is definitely woke.Freelance Culture WriterThis new law can create positive change. States will now take the lead on accountability, interventions and teacher evaluation systems. While some states will mess up, we hope most will learn from the failures of NCLB and give teachers and schools the latitude and support to deeply engage students and to focus on the whole child.President, American Federation of TeachersBernie Sanders successfully differentiated himself between Clinton\u0027s hawkish foreign policy and failures. Sanders is indeed the true front runner, and wins in Iowa and New Hampshire will undermine the groupthink that has so many pundits and observers worshiping at the altar of ever-changing polls.Columnist published in The Cleveland Plain Dealer, The Baltimore Sun, The Hill, Salon, The Jerusalem Post www.hagoodman.comLiberals from other nations will continue to lobby Washington to advance their home countries\u0027 interests. No surprise there. But they shouldn\u0027t complain if American liberals choose priceless domestic peace and prosperity over costly international charity and conflict.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstitutePlace your \"innovation team\" outside the mothership, far away from the hordes that will tell them how \"crazy\" their ideas are. True innovation is massively disruptive and the average employee hates disruptive change.Chairman/CEO, XPRIZEIf Hillary becomes the nominee, as seems likely, young women will come out and vote for her. If she can take steps to remind young women that feminism is far from over, and that she understands the world differently because she is a woman, they may be even more likely to support her.Assistant Professor, Political Science, Rutgers-Camden, specializing in race/gender, identity, and social movements in U.S. politics.Christmas is like a tumbler full of mirth at its finest. When family and friends come home to celebrate the cheer of the season, you drink to your heart\u0027s content and are filled by its warming sway. When you are hurting, the tumbler has a jagged edge.Writer, public speaker, runner, veteran and childhood cancer advocateLittle noticed in the deal that Congress approved Friday is the fact that the anti-abortion lobby got wiped out. The deal included no provisions cutting funding for Planned Parenthood -- an issue on which Republicans have been prepared to shut down the government in past budget fights.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027What this \"debate\" has revealed, in fact, is a mainstream policing mindset ready to manufacture fear without evidence and promote the belief that American civil rights and liberties are actually an impediment to public safety.Senior Writer/Editor, ACLUDecember is prime time for year-end lists. They\u0027re an easy way to reflect on the past year, but lives aren\u0027t on the line when it comes to the top 10 albums of 2015, or the year\u0027s best-selling books. But there is one year-end list that can hold lives in the balance -- animals\u0027 lives.Executive director, Animal Legal Defense FundRepublicans are trying to whip people into a frenzy, then convince them that only by taking extreme steps can their government keep them \"safe.\" And, of course, only Republicans have the you-know-whats to take those extreme steps because \"political correctness,\" blah, blah, blah.Author of \u0027Obama’s America: A Transformative Vision of Our National Identity\u0027There, just inside, is my mother -- or at least what\u0027s left of her. Today, I do not know who is in there. But I am damned if I am going to speak to her like the aged infant she appears to be. She deserves the dignity of being someone\u0027s mother and for this small while, I allow myself the indulgence of being her child.Editor at large, Tasting Table; author, \u0027Hi, Anxiety\u0027The president has the power to destroy the world. And the 2016 candidates -- Democratic and Republican -- have barely been asked about how they approach that terrible responsibility. Nuclear weapons are more dangerous than ISIS will ever be. They deserve a more serious debate.Senior Policy Analyst, Ploughshares FundDemocrats are split.One camp believes everything is okay, at least in presidential years, because the demographic trends favor us and because the Republicans are so damn good at alienating people. Another camp thinks we need to panic because the numbers of Democratic elected officials are so low and Hillary has weaknesses as a candidate.Co-Founder, Democracy PartnersAfter the implosion of the two old parties and the electoral success of the two new parties last night, Iglesias declared that a new Spain is born. He might be right, but for now, that new Spain does not look much like Greece.Associate professor in the School of Public and International Affairs at the University of GeorgiaI am so sick of being told how our generation is such a pain in the ass. You know what\u0027s really a pain in the ass? Practically owing my first born (and their first born) to Sallie Mae for my student loans.Sassy, outspoken, \u0026 passionate about equal rights. Blogger at The Color Coded Life.What she has demonstrated in the current election cycle is an even higher degree of fluidity in this most singular of political communication formats. Her performance in Saturday night\u0027s debate in New Hampshire should give pause to her would-be Republican rivals. This is a woman who knows how to debate.Professor of Journalism, Northeastern University, BostonThe pursuit of the Republican presidential nomination requires appeal to an extreme right wing base that sees the world differently than the majority of Americans. This is particularly true on issues like immigration and the environment.Executive Director, Columbia University\u0027s Earth InstituteCelebrate as you will -- Happy Holidays, Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, something else or nothing at all. But to paraphrase Bernie Sanders, \"enough with your damn war on Christmas.\" Can we just have some peace on earth and lay this phony war to rest in peace?Money Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsPolitical discourse in the U.S. between those on the right and those on the left seems to be increasingly unproductive. And if the subject is something as volatile as gun control, constructive communication may feel impossible. But there\u0027s no reason to let it ruin your holiday dinner.Dad and retired ophthalmologistWe are running around looking for new information because we are trying to convince ourselves that we don\u0027t know enough right now to accomplish what we want. But before we can make positive changes, we need to feel positive about ourselves.Co-host, The World Wanderers PodcastA campaign to honor the struggle to end slavery in the United States is an excellent social studies project to engage students as active citizens responding to racism and in shaping the future the United States.Social studies educator, Hofstra UniversityStopping the investment of public tax dollars on fossil fuel subsidies is one of the first steps the U.S. needs to make in its green transition. When ExxonMobil is reporting $8.8 billion in quarterly profits, they can afford to take the hit.Editor-in-Chief at Planet Experts. I write about green issues.There may be many reasons to feel stressed during the holidays, but grief brings its own brand of challenges. If you\u0027re grieving this year and are wondering how you\u0027ll survive the season, use the following six suggestions to ease the way.Psychotherapist and author of \"Hope and Healing for Transcending Loss\"This is the best chance we\u0027ve had in a long time to take the decision-making that affects our lives and the lives of our children away from lobbyists and the 1 percent that have for far too long dictated the actions of our government. If you vote for Bernie Sanders, you will be voting for America.Psychiatrist, interfaith harmony proponent.In keeping with the figgy-pudding and potato latke traditions of the holidays, here\u0027s a recipe for delivering joy to workers so that they can spread holiday merriment.International President, United SteelworkersGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
