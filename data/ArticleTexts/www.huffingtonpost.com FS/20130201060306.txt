{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor of law and political science, Yale; Author \u0027The Decline and Fall of the American Republic\u0027Is the Supreme Court about to declare war on the twentieth century? This is the larger question raised by an escalating series of decisions, starting with the recent Obamacare case. In designing its sweeping reform, Congress relied on 70 years of case-law, emerging from the New Deal, that upheld its sweeping regulatory authority under the commerce clause. Yet Chief Justice Roberts, as well as four other conservatives, dramatically challenged this basic element of the New Deal settlement. While Roberts made a last minute doctrinal swerve on another issue to uphold the statute, this should not blind us to the dangers that lie ahead. While his act of statesmanship prevented a head-on confrontation between the presidency and the Court, the conservative majority has issued a fundamental challenge to a basic premise of twentieth century constitutionalism.Read Post | Comments (334)Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, 01/31/13NBA Hall of FamerGirls wants to tell us something important about twentysomething females of the 21st Century.

Here\u0027s a cautionary guide.Read Post | Comments (279)Michael Haft and Harrison Suarez, 01/31/13The recent shootings in America are tragic. But by focusing mainly on gun control and mental health, our national debate thus far has overlooked a key factor in questioning why our youngest generation is so violent.
