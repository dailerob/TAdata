{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteAmerican foreign policy is controlled by fools. What else can one conclude from the bipartisan demand that the U.S. intervene everywhere all the time, irrespective of consequences? No matter how disastrous the outcome, the War Lobby insists that the idea was sound. Any problems obviously result, it is claimed, from execution, a matter of doing too little: too few troops engaged, too few foreigners killed, too few nations bombed, too few societies transformed, too few countries occupied, too few years involved, too few dollars spent. As new conflicts rage across the Middle East, the interventionist caucus\u0027 dismal record has become increasingly embarrassing.The International Day of Happiness will be more than just a fun celebration, it will also help to remind us all that the world is a better place when we connect with and care about the people around us.Director of Action for HappinessA mass abduction that was seen a year ago as unprecedented -- sparking justifiable outrage across the world -- now seems, after a series of further kidnaps, to look like a sadly increasingly familiar tactic in the terrorist arsenal.Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationI\u0027m frequently asked the loaded question of how much I am madly in love with Walter. I mostly give the questioner what they want with a nod of assent. But the truth of my emotion is more complicated. I think maybe the problem is with how I have, up to this point, understood the word \"love.\"Executive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostThe choice isn\u0027t between the wrong-headed austerity of sequestration and the failed austerity plan of Simpson-Bowles. Congress must choose to be on the side of women and their families, and against cuts in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.President, National Organization for WomenThe tragic discovery of a missing African-American man\u0027s body hanging from a tree in rural Claiborne County, Mississippi is now being investigated by both state and federal authorities.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityThe college admissions mania that gets worse and worse every year is a mirror of America: anxious and stratified.Author, \u0027Where You Go Is Not Who You’ll Be: An Antidote to the College Admissions Mania\u0027Let me be free. Let me be me! Don\u0027t make me old, with your thinking and words about how I should be. You don\u0027t have to come to my shows. I am giving tremendous energy with my voice, because that is me. Get my energy or shut up.ArtistWhat is needed is a systematic pro-social economics, that combines appreciation for the common good and for others as well as for the service of self.Professor of international relations, George Washington UniversityWhile Obama has slowly stepped up transferring detainees already cleared by a multi-agency process for release from Guantanamo to other countries, his administration has dragged its feet on reviewing the 51 detainees who aren\u0027t yet cleared, out of the remaining 122.Senior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstIn this new American production of the Japanese classic, 47 Republican senators play the roles of the 47 ronin. They too deliberately defy the shogun, played with equanimity by President Obama. But the American ronin are out to kill a policy, not a person.Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogGood defense will force those who want to surveil us to choose their targets, and they simply don\u0027t have the resources to target everyone.Author, Data and Goliath; Fellow, Harvard Law School\u0027s Berkman Center for InternetObamacare was supposed to make birth control free for all women. But that reality is still far off.Editor, HuffPost BusinessThis week not only did President Obama become the first American President to suggest Mandatory Voting in the US but it was also when Oregon became the first state to institute automatic registration... and Israel had a national election with a turn-out nearly 50% higher than ours. Could this become Obama\u0027s second term legacy idea like Ike\u0027s \"military Industrial Complex\"?Host, \u0027Both Sides Now\u0027How does the brain change as we age, and what steps can we take to help our brains stay healthy as time goes by? In answer to my questions, Claire Sexton, a post-doctoral research assistant at the Oxford Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain, elaborated on some of her latest scientific findings and offered some tips on how to improve the quality of our sleep.Starbucks\u0027 ill-conceived campaign seems to exemplify the kind of ignorance that makes racism such a difficult thing to confront and contest. The bottom line is that while we absolutely need multiracial dialogue about race and collective action against racism, we do not need an uninformed, non-consensual, conversation.Writer and sociologist.What is oddest about opposition to action to address climate change is the implications for another priority of the Republican party: deficit reduction. The bury-your-head-in-the-sand approach won\u0027t make extreme weather events driven by a changing climate go away, but it will ensure that our response is uncoordinated, less proactive, and far more expensive.U.S. Representative for New York\u0027s 12th District; Ranking Democrat, Joint Economic CommitteeI left that day almost the same way I came in. Except my feelings of joy, gratitude and respect had grown, and my feelings of sadness and dread had almost, but not completely, disappeared.Writer, Blogger, Creator of, My dishwasher\u0027s possessedFor all the deception and evasion that permeates this year\u0027s House and Senate Republican budgets, one thing comes through clearly: The Republicans have no interest in the well-being of seniors or the disabled. Theirs is an anti-tax agenda for the wealthy and an anti-social-contract agenda for everyone else.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourMost of the things people are thankful in life are the basic: health, family, life, a place to call home and friends. Yet, those things don\u0027t always come easily for me. What I am thankful for is quite different than the average person.Chronic Illness Advocate/Blogger Chronicallyawesome23.blogspot.comThe \"People\u0027s Budget,\" which I helped draft, strikes a strong contrast with the Republican plan. It rewards hard work and invests in our country. It ensures that everyone has an opportunity to get a good education, find a good job, live in a safe and secure home, put food on the table, have affordable health care, save for retirement and maybe have a little left over.U.S. Representative for Illinois\u0027s 9th congressional districtTwo years ago, in March, my younger brother died, quite unexpectedly. He\u0027d been my only sibling and, both of our parents being gone, the only other person in my original family. His daughter had asked my daughter to tell me the news.Professor Emerita, Women and Gender Studies at U.C. DavisThe worlds first true superpower will be the country that creates meaningful work and shared prosperity for it\u0027s citizens and the world by implementing durable distributed grid resource systems that can be delivered anywhere in the world -- with the push of a button.New York Times Best-Selling author, entrepreneur and formerly the host of MSNBC\u0027s The Dylan Ratigan ShowAmong Nintendo\u0027s \"diverse and interesting female protagonists\" are a pink version of a toadstool and a pink version of a bomb, called Toadette and Bombette.Editor, Huffington Post TechWhile labor and sleepless nights may top the list for many of us when we think of tough motherhood experiences, it\u0027s the emotional challenges that I\u0027ve found to be the hardest. After all, when you love someone the way you love a child, you become vulnerable in a way you never imagined possible.Mother, writer, and former business consultantBy strengthening the safety net and investing in 21st-century infrastructure, manufacturing, education, and environmental protection, the Congressional Progressive Caucus\u0027 \"People\u0027s Budget\" will create 8.4 million new jobs and give low- and moderate-income Americans a much-needed raise. And it\u0027s important to note that the CPC\u0027s budget achieves all this without breaking the bank.Dean of the US House of Representatives | Ranking Member, House Judiciary Committee\"We shouldn\u0027t be making it harder to vote, we should be making it easier to vote,\" President Obama said to applause. \"In Australia, other countries, there\u0027s mandatory voting.\" President Obama became the first president to propose this.Filmmaker, Activist, FatherPresident Obama deserves credit for his candor. He admits that we tortured people after 9/11, and that our actions violate our highest ideals as a nation. But apologies are hollow if they are not followed by attempts to make amends. \"Sorry\" is a lie if it is only a word. President Obama needs to prosecute.Political theologian. Author. Orthodox Christian.STOCKHOLM - A breakthrough might compel a phase of intense diplomacy, giving Iran a pathway to diplomatic normalization and opening the door for grand bargains that could begin to restore order and stability to the rest of the region. A breakdown, by contrast, though unlikely to lead immediately to war, could easily foment developments that lead in that direction, and the region as a whole could be pulled even deeper into the current vortex of chaos and violence.Sweden’s foreign minister from 2006 to October 2014, and was Prime Minister from 1991 to 1994The Israeli electorate had a choice to make. By reelecting a leader who publicly reneged on his commitments to peace and a two-state solution, they voted against peace.Palestinian journalistYou\u0027re perusing it, admiring your handiwork. Then you see it. Ack! A rudimentary, easily fixed error is there in the text. It\u0027s standard-size type, but to your eyes it\u0027s in 54-point Bodoni Bold. And somehow, it\u0027s underlined.
