{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"I\u0027m excited to announce the launch of The Huffington Post\u0027s newest international edition, HuffPost Australia. The 15th edition in our growing global network, HuffPost Australia will be dedicated to producing great original reporting about the critical issues that Australians face, and to telling stories that focus on helping Australians live more fulfilling lives, while opening up our blogging platform to voices from all across the country. HuffPost Australia will also be a rich addition to HuffPost\u0027s What\u0027s Working editorial initiative as we highlight people who are bringing fresh solutions to the country\u0027s biggest problems. We can\u0027t wait to open up the conversation around everything Australia can teach the rest of the world about the solutions, innovations and acts of compassion that all too often are left out of the media\u0027s narrative.We know women and older Australians are the two fastest-growing groups in the workforce. And that at the same time the future economy wants us to have more babies now, the government doesn\u0027t want to pay for maternity leave. Securing a spot in a decent childcare centre is like finding the golden goose.Editor-in-Chief, HuffPost AustraliaWhat makes the Amazon hamster-cage halfway plausible as a model of the future? What allows its architects and the successful employees to believe in it?Professor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027Lost in the short-term attention commanded by Donald Trump in the first Republican primary debate was a long-term problem for the party, created by questions that compelled the candidates to take positions at odds with a majority of Americans.SiriusXM Radio Host \u0026 CNN AnchorIt seems that Pennsylvania is about to adopt a new (well, not entirely new) approach to criminal sentencing: Those convicted of crimes will receive longer or shorter sentences depending on whether they are deemed likely to commit crimes in the future.Davidson-Kahn Distinguished University Professor and Professor of Law at Florida International University; Floershimer Distinguished Visiting Professor of Law at Cardozo Law SchoolI saw drones and battle tanks; I could very well have been in a war zone. I guess, in a sense, I was. I was in a space where large groups of Black lives were gathered in a system that is designed to respond to Black lives with violence. I know that I speak for Ms. McSpadden and Mr. Brown Sr. when I tell you to never stop fighting, and that we are grateful.Founder of Garner Way Foundation and daughter of Eric GarnerPolitical Director for Garner Way FoundationEmployers treat replaceable workers as costs to be cut, not as assets to be developed. Replaceable workers almost never get paid family leave, they get a few paid sick days, and barely any vacation time.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027At a time when income inequality is running rampant in the U.S., workers don\u0027t need even more \"free\" trade agreements that will further strip this nation\u0027s economy of middle-income jobs.General President, International Brotherhood of TeamstersIf you\u0027ve turned on your television lately, you\u0027ve likely seen an ad or two blasting the historic Iran nuclear deal. The reality is, millions are being spent in a lobbying effort to destroy an agreement that has been reached after extensive negotiating and diplomacy between world powers and Iran.President, National Action NetworkThere is an underlying contradiction in the Non-Proliferation regime that has been in place for close to half a century. Simply put, the conception of proliferation risk that was embodied in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty had a critical flaw.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghJulian Assange has effectively insisted that another media world is possible and the corporate warfare state is unacceptable. Not coincidentally, the U.S. government wants to capture Assange and put him away, incommunicado, in a prison cell.Author, \u0027War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death\u0027I avoid going to the gym when it is packed with men, mainly after work hours. Then, I move into contemplating my outfit. As in any other moment, I want to be comfortable and look good -- for myself. But, I must weigh the line between being sexy and being sexualized.Recent Graduate, University of MichiganAs Joe Biden polls family and friends about entering the presidential fray, he\u0027s getting two kinds of advice -- personal and political. The personal is about his life, his values and what he can give to his country. The political is about Hillary Clinton\u0027s vulnerability.USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorI cannot stand by when a company like Herbalife has the audacity to publicly proclaim they provide opportunities for Latinas -- neglecting to mention that it is under investigation by the SEC, the FTC and multiple state Attorneys General for intentionally targeting and scamming Hispanic customers.President and CEO of MANA, A National Latina OrganizationCalifornia in the Great Drought is once again Exhibit A, a living diorama of how the future is going to look for a lot of us.Author, A Great Aridness: Climate Change and the Future of the SouthwestCandidates must address the increasing numbers of elders who rely on a quality home care workforce to age with dignity and the dedicated workers who care for them who continue to live without the adequate pay and resources their families need.President of SEIU United Long Term Care Workers, President of SEIU California State Council, and Vice President of SEIU InternationalWhen the Puerto Rico debt crisis burst into the news, Puerto Rico Governor Alejandro García Padilla pronounced that the Commonwealth\u0027s debt crisis \"is not about politics.\" Of course, to paraphrase H.L. Menken, when a politician says something is not about politics, chances are it\u0027s all about politics.President, Fiscal Strategies GroupIn a post titled \"Don\u0027t Blame My \u0027Broken Windows\u0027 Theory For Poor Policing\", Kelling maintains that his theory was never meant to be a high misdemeanor-arrest policy. That\u0027s hard to believe because George Kelling himself measures broken-windows policing by the number of misdemeanor arrests performed by the police.Professor at Columbia University, director of the Columbia Center for Contemporary Critical Thought, author, and human rights lawyerWhile mainstream feminism seems desperate to have in its fold a 19-year-old reality television star who is famous in no small part because her older sister\u0027s sex tape went viral, mainstream feminism rejects empowered women of faith.Author, Painted Hands; co-editor Faithfully FeministIf you embrace your life story and learn from its lessons, your leadership journey leads to great satisfaction and fulfillment.Senior Fellow, Harvard Business SchoolThe one-year anniversary of the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, MO is an opportunity to reflect on the media coverage of the black men and women killed by police and others -- is it always as objective as it ought to be?Eleanor Bontecou Professor of Law at Seton Hall Law School, and co-founder and director of research for the Perception Institute.There\u0027s a Left/Right convergence of anger about the concentration of wealth and power, about corporations dominating democratic institutions, and public officials more beholden to monied interests than to voters or ideas.Senior Fellow, DemosAmerica has lost a great leader, and many of us have lost a good friend. For those of us becoming active in the movement -- especially those of us in the South -- Julian Bond was an absolute hero.Co-Director, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureEarth is full of lots of different people with different concerns, but we all share the same planet. Now is the time to work together to protect it. Making progress on climate change is going to take all of us together, across the U.S. and around the world.Executive Director, NYC Environmental Justice AllianceLast Monday, a Wisconsin judge ruled that two 13-year-old girls would be tried as adults for crimes committed when they were 12. If convicted, they face 65 years in prison. If tried and convicted as juveniles, they would have been held for a maximum of five years in a youth detention facility.Associate editor for Generation ProgressThis is just the latest round of sad but dangerous moves by the sugar drink giant to confuse consumers, stall policy and halt public health.Advisory Board Member of the EAT Initiative, Global Health Fellow at the Harvard Global Equity Initiative, Harvard Medical School and Co-Founder of both NCDFREE and festival21We\u0027re talking here about the keys to the kingdom, the kingdom being the millennial generation whose decisions about gun ownership will spell the life or death of the gun industry in the years to come.Mike the Gun Guy22 Democratic and 36 Republican members of Congress spent a full week of the August recess in Israel rather than among the constituents they were elected to serve.Producer and Host, \u0027The Paula Gordon Show\u0027Bond didn\u0027t just force me to rethink my jaundiced and cynical view of the NAACP. He also forced me to rethink my view of the organization\u0027s leadership, the challenges it faced and the struggles and controversies both within and without that embroiled the organization.Author and political analystAfter forty years of rising income and wealth inequality, some of America\u0027s rich seem worried that maybe things have gone too far.Jeff Faux, author of The Servant EconomyI realized when I became a solo mother just how vital a role raising sons was -- I was shaping the men of the future, raising the next generation of men and I wanted to raise men that were in touch with their feelings and able to articulate them.Writer,Goddess,Wife, Lover of LifeGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
