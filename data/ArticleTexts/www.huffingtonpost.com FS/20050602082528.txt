{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AriannaHere I am at the 2005 Take Back America conference in Washington. I haven’t seen this many committed progressives in one place since Pete Seeger and the Weavers disbanded.What a difference a year makes... A year ago, everyone at the conference was focused on one goal and one goal only: get Bush out of office. Now the fear and loathing of the Bush administration is matched by the anger and frustration at the Democratic leadership’s failure to define what the party stands for beyond opposing privatizing Social Security and Bill Frist’s nuclear option. Indeed, now that Deep Throat has been unmasked, the greatest unsolved mystery in Washington is: what does the Democratic Party stand for?Read more06.01.2005 Harry ShearerTuesday night, Larry King interviewed Bush 41 and Barbara Sr. And you know, tough as you might want to be during an interview, you still gotta take the opportunity to see if the interviewee might want to speak at a charity dinner you\u0027re emceeing. That\u0027s why God made commercial breaks.read whole post | permalink | comments06.01.2005 Erica JongGod knows it’s no fun to think about nuclear incineration. It’s really depressing. I look at my 16-month old grandson, Max, and I try to wrap my mind around a nuclear accident in New York and my mind just doesn’t want to go there. But let’s get real. The materials are there. The terrorists are there. Nine countries have nukers and counting. Why is nobody focusing on this? As we used to say in the 60’s, what do you do in the case of a terrorist with a loose nuke? “Bend over and kiss your ass goodbye.”read whole post | permalink06.01.2005 Paul FeigThank GOD that the American Family Association has finally boycotted Ford for being \"the company which has done the most to affirm and promote the homosexual lifestyle\"! My only beef with the AFA is that it\u0027s not going far enough. For instance, I know for a fact that kids are still reading in their history books about the Enola Gay. And what about that Ben Gay stuff you rub on your sore muscles? Why not just put a disco ball and a bottle of Captain Morgan in the box with it?read whole post | permalink | comments06.01.2005 Gina NahaiHe’s all about “family values,” this Pope -- secular laws passed by democratic governments aren’t going to get in his way. I’m not surprised. I was born and raised in Iran. I know all about kings and clergy and the inexplicable reaction most people have to men in uniform. What does surprise me is how the Vatican has remained, so far at least, under George W.’s radar; how it doesn’t appear on any list of countries where the United States has a duty to bring freedom. I’ve sized the situation up from every reasonable angle and I can tell you, this is one place badly in need of the Bush Doctrine.read whole post | permalink | comments06.01.2005 Jane WellsAs I venture into the camp, I am shocked by how tidy it is. People have next to nothing here, so there is no trash or waste. The IDPs reuse even plastic bags and scraps of sack. As we walk, children materialize from their silent tents and surround me, tens, then hundreds of them, all vying for the right to touch me and hold my hand. It is a startling moment. I learn in 30 seconds what it must have felt like to be Princess Diana. It’s a distraction for them, and I accept it as that.read whole post | permalink | comments06.01.2005 Randall RobinsonThey are dead. Forever dead. All 1665 of them. All 100,000 of the Iraqi men, women, and children as well. Gone. Sons. Daughters. Fathers who never met their children. As if they were discardable. Ephemeral. Units of war room data. Gone. All of them. Dying still. Every day. Right up until our inevitable departure, after which, the news theater will go dark and none of us will know what happened next, and we will all forget, our dead and theirs, because that is what we have developed a habit of doing.read whole post | permalink | comments06.01.2005 Stephanie SandbergThink the Cheney women are really anti-choice? Think any of the Bush women are? Think that in their hearts, any of the women in the Bush-Cheney clans are afraid of what would happen if gay people fully embraced family values, settled down and had children?read whole post | permalink06.01.2005 Geoffrey R. StoneThe disclosure of Valerie Plame\u0027s identity as a CIA operative by White House offcials violated federal law. In \"leaking\" this information, those officials were attempting to enlist reporters in a criminal act. Even under the most expansive conception of the journalist-source privilege, those sources have no privilege to do that, and thus Miller and Cooper are protecting no one but themselves. They are not Woodward and Bernstein.read whole post | permalink | comments06.01.2005 James BoyceHow often have we sat there as some conservative wag has shrugged their shoulders and said “Well, maybe the Democrats will come up with an idea of their own instead of just criticizing the President’s vision.” I have recently discovered why they are able to do this so effectively. The Democrats don’t have any ideas.read whole post | permalink06.02.2005 Paul KrassnerFollowing the example of ABC News, CBS\u0027 John Roberts has joined AAAA, the American Association of Asshole Anchors, as he peppers the CBS News with inane comments apparently designed to ingratiate himself with what he desperately hopes are young viewers. After a story about how the omnipresence of DVDs is responsible for so many empty seats in movie theaters, he observed, “But still, the new Star Wars really rocks.”read whole post | permalink | comments06.01.2005 Doug HellerFor the last few years, insurance firms have pushed to limit the liability of doctors and hospitals when they injure patients due to negligence or error. The companies, along with the American Medical Association, aruge that skyrocketing insurance premiums for physicians are driven by exponentially increasing claims payments made to injured patients who file claims and lawsuits for medical malpractice. Well, the data is in, and the medical-insurance lobby has been lying.read whole post | permalink06.01.2005 Jay WinstenAbsent a catalyzing event, what’s likely to be required is the gradual evolution of a new, deeply felt moral compass that eventually will move the world to action on Africa. As Tony Blair put it, \"The state of Africa is a scar on the conscience of the world.\" But we’re far from a point where public consciousness has embraced this moral awareness.read whole post | permalink | comments06.01.2005 Danielle CrittendenThe French have declared a resounding “Non!” to the European Constitution. Political analysts tell us that the French rejected the constitution because the document was confusing, long-winded, and ultimately suspicious -- not unlike their politicians or, come to think of it, their movies. Perhaps it would help reassure the French if the following amendments were added...read whole post | permalink | comments06.01.2005 Dal LaMagnaPart of Felt’s duties was to direct counter intelligence programs (COINTELPRO) created to repress political dissent. Programs were created to infiltrate and discredit the Civil Rights Movement, the American Indian Movement, as well as dissident student groups. Felt admitted to a grand jury that his program had authorized illegal break-ins and burglaries against friends and relatives of Weather Underground fugitives. For this he was convicted, but pardoned by President Regan before he was to begin serving his sentence. So then, why the moral conscience in the Watergate break-ins?read whole post | permalink | comments06.01.2005 Richard BradleyWho the hell is John D. O\u0027Connor? That\u0027s what I kept thinking as I read O\u0027Connor\u0027s piece in Vanity Fair on Mark Felt, a.k.a. Deep Throat. But the question I was really wondering is, Why not Woodward and Bernstein? If Felt was going to come forward, why not choose the guys who\u0027d always protected him to disclose his secret? The answer seems to be that it wasn\u0027t the 91-year-old Felt who wanted to reveal his identity, but Felt\u0027s family, and particularly his daughter Joan. And that raises some disturbing questions about how exactly this story came into being.read whole post | permalink | comments05.31.2005 Nora EphronFor many years, I have lived with the secret of Deep Throat’s identity. It has been hell, and I have dealt with the situation by telling pretty much anyone who asked me, including total strangers, who Deep Throat was. Not for nothing is indiscretion my middle name. I knew that Deep Throat was Mark Felt because I figured it out. Carl Bernstein, to whom I was married for a brief time, certainly would never have told me; he was far too intelligent to tell me a secret like that.read whole post | permalinkWatch The Video","h1":"",".title":"","h2":"On The Blog NowKing-Sized Week, Part 2Loose NukesFINALLY!!!On to the VaticanWitness to Darfur (Part 3)Sending Children to DieOn PointDeep Throat Redux: Are Miller and Cooper Woodward and Bernstein?If I am by Myself in the Woods and Actually Have an Idea, Can I Still be a Democrat?Embarrassing Media MomentsInsurance Companies Lying?
