{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThe nation\u0027s economy expanded at an annual rate of 2 percent last quarter, according to this morning\u0027s GDP report. That\u0027s faster than last quarter\u0027s 1.3 percent and a bit above what most analysts were expecting, so that\u0027s good. But it\u0027s also just trend growth -- 2 percent is about what it takes to keep the job market pretty much where it is. I could easily write the campaign press releases: Romney/Ryan: growth too slow! Obama/Biden: 13th quarter of expansion, growth picked up from last quarter, no time to change horses (I\u0027d add: especially when the other horse wants to run hard in the wrong direction).Read Post | Comments (76)Keith Thomson, 10/26/12Reporter and authorIn the United States, 35 percent of this year\u0027s general election votes will be cast on electronic voting machines that are said to have been \"designed with insufficient attention to computer security.\"Read Post | Comments (438)Mark Cuban, 10/25/12Owner, Dallas Mavericks; Chairman, HDNetThere is no greater opportunity than here in America.

Years are already a bit blurry, and decades were mostly beyond the limits of consideration for most of human history. And our reaction to perils in the modern world remains bounded by this biology -- if we let it.Read Post | CommentsSoraya Chemaly, 10/26/12Feminist, Writer, Satirist... not always in that orderRemember facts? Remember facts about rape? Because it turns out that a whole lot of people know less than nothing about the subject.

Talbott, 10/26/12Author, \"Survival Investing: How to Prosper Amid Thieving Banks and Corrupt Governments\"There is no reason to assume the big banks will be around in the long run. Therefore, do not take comfort that your money is safe with them. If you have less than $250,000 in an FDIC insured deposit account, then at least you have the US standing behind the claim. But, otherwise, beware.Read Post | CommentsJohn Hewko and Jeffrey Sachs, 10/26/12Some people ask why we should spend hundreds of millions of dollars to finish the job on polio when there are so many other health priorities.
