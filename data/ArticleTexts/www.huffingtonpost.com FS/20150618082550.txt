{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Fellow, Center for American Progress; President, JustJobs Network Inc.These days, we\u0027ve grown accustomed to economic debates winding up in bitter gridlock. In the embattled halls of the U.S. Congress, lawmakers have nearly torpedoed Obama\u0027s Trans Pacific Partnership. In the Eurozone, the failure to find agreement on Greek debt is sending the country spiraling toward default. But underneath the rumble of political debates, the tender shoots of a new global consensus around commonsense, practical and progressive economics are emerging. It\u0027s what Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven calls the Global Deal -- a new compromise between capital and labor that would ensure shared prosperity by putting jobs at the center of global macroeconomic policy.Europe\u0027s demands -- ostensibly aimed at ensuring that Greece can service its foreign debt -- are petulant, naive and fundamentally self-destructive. In rejecting them, the Greeks are not playing games; they are trying to stay alive.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia UniversitySometimes this gift of knowing how delicate life is can start to feel too real. It makes you feel stuck, anxious and scared of losing everyone you love. But in the midst of all of that, there are so many incredible surprises in store for all of us. Every morning we wake up is a gift.Digital Marketing Consultant and WriterThe fact that Rachel Dolezal was able to get away with living as a Black woman, albeit precariously, for so long is ironic as well as troubling. Her entire life story is the classic definition of White privilege.Professor of history, African-American studies and gender studies, East Tennessee State UniversityPope Francis\u0027 Laudato Si plea for environmental sanity and a serious recommitment to the Bible\u0027s call for humanity to be stewards of this planet earth just might make a huge difference by puncturing through the emotional depression that keeps most of the people of the earth paralyzed in face of the growing crisis.With the EU referendum bill racing through parliament, it is not too late to rethink fundamentals. Voters should not make their epochal decision on the basis of sound-bites and twitter-feeds. They should instead be given a day off from work to engage in a National Day of Deliberation on the basic issues at stake.Professor of law and political science, Yale; Author \u0027We the People:The Civil Rights Revolution\u0027Janet Peck Chair in International Communication at Stanford UniversityPhysicians and health professionals have lowered the rates of many deadly infectious diseases by instituting careful, data-driven, broadly-instituted approaches like hand-washing, universal vaccination, and food and drug quality laws. We need to consider firearms and bullets as pathogens, similar to the smallpox virus and its disease, smallpox.Pediatrician, teacher, parent, photographer, advocate for improved child health and safetyThe causes of our environmental crisis are more complex than any single religion. We can neither vilify Christianity, nor idealize ancient pagan religions.Managing Editor of HumanisticPaganism.comThat is one of the most important political events of the past several years. Investor oriented globalization faces by far its most serious challenge -- now its up to those of us who have been left out of trade diplomacy to come forward with better ideas.Former executive director and chairman, Sierra ClubSeeing Trump\u0027s candidacy as merely cynical, or ironic, or somehow merely a brief manifestation of late capitalism\u0027s excesses misses the point: this is also a serious candidacy that will have serious repercussions for both Democrats and Republicans alike.Assistant Professor of English at University of New Hampshire; Series Co-Editor, Best American Experimental WritingThe wins in Colorado and Washington represent the fruit of a broad national evolution on this issue. A majority of American voters now support full legalization. This movement does not result simply from the rise of the millennial generation, which is more favorable towards reform.Anna Greenberg is Senior Vice President at Greenberg Quinlan Rosner ResearchScalia has identified himself as a \"faint-hearted originalist.\" Nowhere is his faint-heartedness more evident than in his refusal to seriously consider whether and to what extent the Constitution protects unenumerated rights.Assistant Director at the Institute for JusticeThere is one very practical measure, immediately realizable and eminently feasible that is, as it were, staring the pope right in the face: The pope should not only end the Catholic Church\u0027s morally absurd and repugnant opposition to contraception, but should urge all families to engage in responsible family planning.President \u0026 CEO, Center for Inquiry; Author of The Necessity of SecularismNow that we\u0027re midlifers, the whole friendship thing is a little trickier to master. Chaotic schedules and stressful careers leave little time to nurture a new friendship between people with no shared history. That\u0027s just the way it is as you grow older.Senior Editor, The Huffington PostFor years, I have been entering farming facilities in the dead of night, rescuing a small handful of animals. The scale of the violence endured by these animals (like Yulin\u0027s dogs) is hard to believe. And, yet the slaughter of billions of these animals in US food production (unlike Yulin\u0027s dogs) barely registers as a public concern.Lawyer, investigator, and co-founder of animal rights network Direct Action Everywhere.It is a common and hyperbolic refrain that Democrats have been (and still are) the anti-religion party. Now, however, Republicans may be running into religion problems of their own as evangelical and Roman Catholics become more engaged with issues such as poverty and climate change.Director of the Center for Peace and Spirituality and University Chaplain at Pacific UniversitySpeaking out against the impending injustice against Haitians in the Dominican Republic is the first thing we can do to begin to reclaim our credibility and moral standing. I intend to express my concerns directly to Dominican and Haitian leaders in the coming days.Former Governor of Maryland and Mayor of BaltimoreIn 2014, tech billionaire Sean Parker announced he would invest $9.3 million dollars in Brigade, a new company that aims to \"use social media to transform politics\" and reignite civic engagement and activism in American life. On Wednesday, the new company finally gave the public a sense of how Brigade will actually work by releasing its first app.Senior Editor for Technology and Society, The Huffington Post.Google\u0027s multimillion-dollar investment is a bold step in the right direction for a company with a history of innovation. More companies, both in and out of the tech world, should choose to follow their lead and champion diversity and inclusion. If they fail to do so, they risk being left behind.Executive Director, Council of Urban ProfessionalsI live and teach in the same community as Rachel Dolezal. \"What are you?\" is an anxiety-producing question for me and for many mixed people. Calls for \"proof\" of heritage overlook the oppressive histories people of color have with respect to documentation.Professor of Women’s and Gender Studies at Gonzaga University in Spokane, WAViewing their workplace as their \"mission field\" causes many Christians to (sooner or later, in one way or another) evangelize at their place of employment.Founder, NALT Christians ProjectIt\u0027s the work of Amit Sood, MD, chair of the Mind-Body Medicine Initiative at Mayo, who has devoted his career to learning how we can live with less stress and more joy. His conclusion: Happiness is a habit that you can build over time. Here are six ways you can start today, as outlined in Dr. Sood\u0027s book.Health.com motivates you to eat smart, stay fit, be happy, and live your best life.Because of improvements in medical ethics over the past thirty years, we tend to think that this paternalistic attitude no longer or minimally exists. However paternalism in science is all too alive and healthy.Neurologist, public health specialist, authorAt 70, \"The Lady\" remains the leading voice for democracy in this strategic part of the world. Much depends on how she uses that voice from now on. The fall election will be the first relatively free ballot in 25 years -- and she needs every vote she can get to reduce the military\u0027s grip on the government.Former speechwriter at the U.S. Department of StateWhile reports maintain that Hezbollah is currently winning the decisive battle in Qalamoun, on the Lebanese eastern border, analysts believe they are showing signs of being stretched thin. Against this backdrop, there are several indications that Israel may take the opportunity to conduct a preemptive surprise attack.An Iranian-Canadian political analyst. He has extensively written analytical pieces surrounding Iranian foreign and domestic politics.One in six Americans struggles with food insecurity. Yes, we said Americans. Yet 40 percent of all food goes to waste. While a good part of that percentage is derived from people throwing out half-eaten grub, another significant chunk of waste is generated far before a meal reaches a diner\u0027s plate.Writer and editor exploring food politics, food culture and Millennials at EveTurow.comThe good news for Rush Limbaugh: One month after being notified he was getting dumped by his Boston talk radio host station, the talker has a new AM home in New England. The bad news: The station currently boasts a 0.6 rating.Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaEco-friendly travel is a crucial part, though, so be sure to travel with a responsible operator and remember these tips when traveling abroad.www.theactivetimes.comCaring about climate change is not foreign to our values as human beings on this planet, regardless of which faith we do or don\u0027t espouse. It\u0027s not inconsistent with being a Christian or a Catholic or even -- despite what the polls say about our opinions -- an evangelical.Climate ScientistI do not need the cards. I do not need the presents. I do not need the attention. However, contrary to popular belief, or what Hallmark wants you to think, Father\u0027s Day isn\u0027t about me.Www.rabbib.comWhen I was growing up in Cleveland, my dad was a bus driver and a proud member of the Amalgamated Transit Union.
