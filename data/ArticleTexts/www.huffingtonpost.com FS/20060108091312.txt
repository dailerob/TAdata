{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"APBill Frist and Tom DeLay are the Beltway incarnations of John Rigas and Dennis Kozlowski, the Adelphia and Tyco CEOs who used their companies as their personal piggy banks -- and have been sentenced to serious jail time because of it. I see the same self-dealing, the same hubris, the same mentality that says, I can do anything I want, say anything I want, give money and high-paying jobs to anyone I want. Of course, politicians like Frist and DeLay should pay an even higher price than the corporate Capones since they are betraying something even more sacred than shareholders: the public trust.READ POST | comments (75)01.07.2006 Rob SpillmanI\u0027d like to offer up a semi-regular list, a \"Buzz Watch\" of literary books eagerly anticipated by the publishing hive\u0027s worker-bees. So what are the drones rubbing their legs together about in early 2006?READ POST | comments01.07.2006 Harry ShearerHere\u0027s a story about the Afghan reaction to US plans to tiptoe quietly out of the country, and here is a piece about why the Afghans might well be concerned.READ POST | comments (16)01.07.2006 Al EiseleThe war in Iraq isn\u0027t going badly enough, so President Bush has to invite the chief architect of an even more disastrous and divisive war to the White House to advise him.READ POST | comments (26)01.07.2006 Steve CobbleThere are more than 160 Town Halls and meetings going on today, Saturday, all across the country, talking about ending the war.READ POST | comments01.06.2006 Karen KwiatkowskiThe destruction of a sovereign Iraq was the primary objective of this war. Bush was and remains correct from the moment he famously landed on an aircraft carrier and announced, \"Mission Accomplished.\"READ POST | comments (24)01.07.2006 RJ EskowAmericans want Democrats to take control of Congress. Sounds great, but like Bush\u0027s plunging poll numbers, it\u0027s another example of an odd phenomenon: Democrats do best at the things they\u0027re powerless to change.READ POST | comments (46)01.06.2006 Simon JenkinsThe good news is that 2006 will see the effective end of the western occupation of Iraq. It will end because everyone will be exhausted: the Americans, the British, the Iraqis and their neighbours. It will end because all justification for its continuance will have evaporated.READ POST | comments (29)01.06.2006 Jeremy PikserIt\u0027s high time the public realized that having no experience is REQUIRED of the person entrusted with the highest positions in select areas of government.READ POST | comments (25)01.06.2006 Norman SolomonBenjamin Netanyahu is media savvy. He knows how to spin on American television. And he\u0027s very dangerous.READ POST | comments (16)01.06.2006 Steve AndersonEach generation creates greater achievements, so one can argue that each generation supersedes the previous. Except for the guy who invented the \"Baby On Board\" sign for car windows.READ POST | comments (27)01.06.2006 Bill BarolLIVE!!... a shot of some police cruisers parked at angles in a condo parking lot.

And no shrink can help me. But if there was one who could, I would ask this: How in bloody hell did Al Gore or John Kerry not absolutely destroy President Bush in the debates?READ POST | comments (118)01.05.2006 Paul RieckhoffApparently I can\u0027t say this enough: It puts our Troops in danger when the President takes anything less than an unequivocal stand against the use of torture. Period.READ POST | comments (47)01.05.2006 Cenk UygurUnder a theory Sam Alito supports, the President can decide to ignore whatever laws he wants -- doesn\u0027t that make him a dictator?READ POST | comments (53)01.05.2006 Paul CumminsPerhaps by gathering together this list of twenty disparate (yet, I believe, related) items, the legacy will be seen for the mean-spirited, unenlightened, arrogant, plutocratic-cronyistic agenda that it is.READ POST | comments (106)01.05.2006 David SirotaIt\u0027s almost entirely implausible that a progressive House Democrat would be a source for a Bob Novak column, which means either the supposed \"source\" was fabricated out of thin air, or the source isn\u0027t a \"liberal\" or even a Democrat.READ POST | comments (26)AP/Kevork DjansezianAPFrom nytimes.comAFP/Justin SullivanFrom bbc.co.ukReuters/Robert GalbraithLogin to Huffington Post  |  Make Huff Post your Home Page  |  RSS/XML  |  Sitemap  |  Advertising  |  JobsCopyright 2005 © HuffingtonPost.com, LLC   |  User Agreement  |  Privacy  |  Comment Policy  |  Powered by MovableType","h1":"“DeLay, Inc.” Out Of Business…",".title":"","h2":"Abramoff Scandal Turns a Spotlight on the Charitable Foundation DodgeIn Charity, Too, the Rich Get RicherFuture Tense: Buzz Books for Early 2006The true meaning of a fundamentalist ChristianOpera Fans--Go See \"Match Point\"RadioNation Debut at \"Out of Iraq\" Town HallFuture Tense: Buzz Books for Early 2006The Forgotten WarRobert McNamara: He\u0027s Baaaaaaack!RadioNation Debut at \"Out of Iraq\" Town HallHe-Said, He-Said, and a 2006 PredictionAre the Democrats Saying the Serenity Prayer - Backwards?Leave the Field Now - The Iraqi Endgame is About to BeginYou Go, Alice.
