{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"I just arrived in Auckland, New Zealand, after a few very pleasant days in Australia, which is just coming out of a pleasant winter and heading into an even more pleasant spring. Did I mention it\u0027s very pleasant there? It\u0027s a country where the people are as sunny as the weather. They\u0027re upbeat, social, outgoing, gregarious, eager to connect and engage. And yet they\u0027re not immune to some of the same darker trends confronting other countries. Australia may be geographically isolated from the rest of the world, but they\u0027re right in the middle with the rest of us in facing the roadblocks that keep us from living a healthy life -- from overwork and exhaustion to burnout and stress, all amplified by technology. And Australia has its own traditions and unique ways of getting around these roadblocks -- from a vibrant beach culture to the ancient Aboriginal concept of \"Dreamtime.\"Abused as a child. Bullied. Raised by a terrorist. These are true facts about the life of Zak Ebrahim. Here\u0027s another one: Today, Zak tours the world as an advocate for tolerance and peace. Watch his remarkable story, and ask yourself: What does it take to choose nonviolence?Author, The Terrorist\u0027s SonAny reader unfamiliar with the ACLU\u0027s history and its leadership would be led by Geoffrey Stone\u0027s assertions to believe that the new leadership of the ACLU has come in and turned the ACLU\u0027s policy on campaign finance and free speech upside down. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth.Executive Director, ACLU (1978-2001, Retired)Measured according to the priority of civic life over war-making, the wars promoted by our recent presidents against the background image of September 11th are disturbingly paradoxical.Political theorist and author of \u0027Civic War and the Corruption of the Citizen\u0027Whether or not the NFL knew the true ugliness of the Rice situation and tried to bury it, what they should know now is that we are all watching very closely what they do from here on out. The league has the opportunity to send a strong message that it will not stand for any level of domestic violence.Philanthropist, Author, EntrepreneurThe Pistorius decision reflects a culture-wide challenge to hold accountable abusers and others who perpetrate domestic violence.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarWars often fail to solve the problems and ultimately make them worse. War has to answer to metrics, just as more peaceful alternatives do. The war in Iraq was a complete failure with enormous human and financial costs; ISIS is now one of the consequences.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersThe day when we all eventually do age is real, is out there, is waiting for each and every one of us. It comes even when you feel younger than your years, even when you truly believe that age is just a number and that you are only as old as you feel.Senior Writer, The Huffington PostBecause colleges and universities are tax-exempt institutions and receive other forms of government subsidies, policymakers can and should insist that they meet some basic standards in promoting economic diversity among their student bodies.E.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeThe New York state elections just concluded, and the national midterms are still weeks away, but there is a campaign office in downtown Manhattan that has just gone into overdrive. Volunteers there are hard at work on another deadline: September 21.Co-founder and Communications Director, 350.orgAt times, I think I was born the day Jackson was diagnosed. The world falls silent as cancer shuts out all the background noise of work stress, mortgages, that extra 10 pounds or what\u0027s on TV. It awakens a level of empathy to suffering and an awareness to what\u0027s truly important in life.Mom of two; \"Mothering Miracles\" bloggerWhen many people hear child poverty in America, the first stereotype is an inner-city child. But in a nation where over 16 million children, more than one in five, are poor, the truth is that child poverty affects children everywhere, although we know it affects urban, suburban, and rural children in some ways differently.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundIf we\u0027ve read evidence supporting our management decisions, let\u0027s own it by truly referring to the literature. But if we are only vaguely aware of research that supports a questioned decision, without first taking time to read the evidence and/or supporting editorials and guidelines, let us not sugarcoat our lack of due diligence.Medical writing for patients, students and practitioners.Everyday Americans are connecting those dots. They see that their opinions and voices are increasingly being shut out of a system that is supposed to be of, by, and for them.Executive Vice President for Policy and Program, People For the American Way \u0026 People For the American Way FoundationCheney\u0027s factual errors, misleading statements and hypocrisy are a continuation of his eight years as vice president. Blaming Obama for everything that is not right in the world does not help this country deal with the challenges it faces in the Middle East.Senior Fellow, Center for American ProgressInstead of going back to war in the Middle East, President Obama should announce alternative, and more effective ways to degrade ISIS. Here are a few suggestions.Advocacy Director, Win Without WarThis year, Drugs Over Dinner was born to facilitate honest, personal and non-judgmental conversation about drugs in America and the root causes of our culture of addiction.Features Editor, The Huffington PostThe president and his staff showed that he holds politics above the latino and immigrant communities, and continues to move forward with his efforts to lower the expectation for what is possible for him to do.Organizer with Orange County Immigrant Youth UnitedIf Republicans want to defend the rights of corporations and billionaires to spend unlimited, secret money in campaigns, then they should say so. But they do not get a free pass to defend unlimited, secret political spending by sidestepping the question and pretending that Democrats are attacking our nation\u0027s First Amendment.Democratic Senator from Rhode IslandAddiction proliferates behind walls. It feeds off the delusion of our separateness. We suffer in silence and too often recover in a shroud of secrecy. Although I would never judge any teacher who is unwilling to sacrifice anonymity in order to tell their story of recovery, I also think it\u0027s necessary to be honest with ourselves about what keeps us from sharing more often. I think we\u0027d be pleasantly surprised to see how much our students would gain when we stop obsessing so much about what we might lose.The stuff that hooks us.In the 40 years since I was the first woman of color to appear on the cover of American Vogue, things in the fashion realm have gone through a world of change. And yet at the same time -- unfortunately -- many things have remained the same.Supermodel and BusinesswomanYou don\u0027t win football games by only playing defense. And you don\u0027t win mid-elections that way either. Perhaps somebody should remind the Democrats that winning elections, like winning games, requires you to take the game to the opposition, and to take it to them on your terms -- not on theirs.Worrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsNearly everything you use or consume -- the coffee at your elbow, the table it\u0027s sitting on, the smart device you\u0027re reading this on -- was carried to you on a truck, and the chances are nearly 100 percent that that truck ran on diesel fuel.Head of the heavy-duty vehicles program of the International Council on Clean TransportationThis is a manageable public health crisis that we know how to solve, but doing so requires our focus, our attention, our resolve and our resources, tools that only the United States has.U.S. Senator from DelawareAlthough negative political ads take a toll, in most elections voters respond to positive messages. 2014 may prove to be an exception to this rule, as Republicans have waged a relentlessly negative campaign.Berkeley writer, retired Silicon Valley executiveHow do they make it? I tried to save with modest meals, usually bananas for breakfast and graham crackers for dinner, and yes, I was hungry. Can you imagine the difficult choices a minimum wage worker makes every single day? What about their kids?Pat Quinn is the 41st Governor of Illinois.President Obama should feature national service in his 2015 State of the Union Address, requesting in his final two budgets sufficient funding to put AmeriCorps back on the trajectory a bipartisan Congress authorized.Co-Chair, The Franklin Project at The Aspen Institute \u0026 CEO, Civic EnterprisesCo-Chair, Franklin Project at the Aspen Institute and CEO, Be The Change, Inc.Co-Chair, The Franklin Project at The Aspen Institute \u0026 CEO, Civic EnterprisesI used to get so annoyed when outdoor toys found their way indoors: sand buckets and pool noodles, hula hoops and soccer balls, the tricycle, the scooter. Now, I just take three deep breaths and look away.Writer, tween whisperer, toddler wrangler.How sweet it must be for the war profiteers to see the U.S. treasury tapped yet again so they can profit from blowing up weapons and Humvees that ISIL now controls that they already profited from when they were first sold off and given to the Iraqi military.Professor, historian, authorAny ideology fixated on preserving marriage and the nuclear family should be proactively encouraging as many couples to marry as possible, including gay couples. It\u0027s time to call out the hypocrisy of the right: It doesn\u0027t make sense to be pro-marriage and pro-family while opposing gay marriage and gay families.Political Journalist and Social CommentatorThe Skeleton Twins has an indie spirit, but it\u0027s also a fun crowd pleaser that\u0027s a real star turn for Bill Hader and proof that he\u0027s more than ready for leading man duties in comedies or dramas.Gentleman farmer, film critic for ReThink ReviewsGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"SPORTS GONE MAD NFL STAR INDICTED FOR CHILD ABUSE NBA GM ON LEAVE FOR RACE REMARKS FOOTBALL COMMISH \u0027SHOULD BE CUT\u0027 BLADE RUNNER GETS \u0027CULPABLE HOMICIDE\u0027",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
