{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Pierre OmidyarCEO and publisher of Honolulu Civil Beat, Founder of eBayThe government\u0027s actions against WikiLeaks in 2010 and companies\u0027 reactions to that pressure, as well as the prosecution of the PayPal 14 raise critical questions about the nature of the First Amendment in the digital age. The First Amendment is primarily a restraint on government intrusion and a bedrock principle of our society. How do commercial interests interact with those protections? How does government ensure space for free expression online when there are no public sidewalks or street corners? How can unpopular dissent resist government pressure when that dissent depends on commercial Internet providers to reach its audience? These are vital questions in today\u0027s society.CommentsDiane RavitchHistorian, NYU professorThe news reports say that the test scores of American students on the latest PISA test are \"stagnant,\" \"lagging,\" and \"flat.\" The myth persists that once our nation led the world on international tests, but we have fallen from that exalted position in recent years. Wrong, wrong, wrong.Comments (79)Aaron SherinianVice President of Communications and Public Relations for the United Nations Foundation.The beauty of #GivingTuesday is that families can join in whatever way works best for them, whether it\u0027s volunteering at a food kitchen, donating to a nonprofit, or raising awareness of an issue on social media. This is a great way to share the spirit of giving with our children.CommentsTess MunsterPlus size model, make up artist, blogger, activistOur bodies tell a story, and everyone\u0027s journey is different, everybody is different, unique, and exquisite. The only problem is that not everyone one respects that or comprehends that we don\u0027t have to all look like a cookie cutter or perfect picture of \"health.\"Comments (40)Olivia ColePoet, author, and activistThat\u0027s what you said, right? That the discussion of structural racism made you uncomfortable? That you felt the classroom was hostile? That you didn\u0027t like that \"we have to talk about this all the time\"? I have a simple question for you: how do you think people of color feel?Comments (84)George H. W. BushFormer President of the United StatesI was honored to be the first American President to welcome Mr. Mandela to the White House. It remains a genuine highlight from those four years I was privileged to hold that high office.CommentsKatie D. AndersonAuthor of the young adult novel KISS \u0026 MAKE UP and regular contributor at parade.com on raising teenagersWake up, people. This needless incessant phone-to-phone contact is ruining relationships and not just romantic ones. Bottom line: Our children need a break.Comments (39)Jon HotchkissCreator, ThisvsThatShow.comThe problem with e-readers is that we don\u0027t know what affect, if any, reading content on a digital device has on retention and comprehension. Until now.Comments (32)Diana Butler BassAuthor, \"Christianity After Religion: The End of Church and the Birth of a New Spiritual Awakening\"Ancient Christian saints, theologians and evangelists would be horrified that those who claim to stand for tradition have forgotten the most important aspect of it. Jesus Christ was not born that human beings would spend December shopping or saying, \"Merry Christmas.\"Comments (1,009)John KerryU.S. Secretary of StateThe truth is that in many ways, here at home, we\u0027ve ended 1985\u0027s meaning of \"AIDS as we knew it.\" It\u0027s not an unspoken word -- nor is it an automatic death sentence. And since PEPFAR, we\u0027re on the road to do the same globally. But now we have to end the era of AIDS -- period.Comments (22)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027There is a large and growing movement to pressure Walmart to raise its workers\u0027 wages. This has taken the form of direct action by workers, efforts to pass higher minimum wage or living wage laws, and implicit threats of consumer boycotts if Walmart does not raise wages and benefits.Comments (375)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesLooking at all the recent comings out among celebrities, Daley and Bello provide yet another way for public figures to announce who they are (even if they\u0027re not exactly choosing what category they fit in). And that gives young people who may be LGBT even more options.CommentsJessica RassetteBlogger, PhotographerThe magic of tomorrow is that it will be exactly like today, except everything will be different.Comments (32)Michael RundleHuffPost UK Technology EditorTwo weeks ago, I was Verified on Twitter. While outwardly meaningless, gaining that simple Blue Tick has since taken me on a journey of self-discovery which I never expected, and I hope will never end.CommentsRobert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, Beyond OutrageTechnology and globalization are driving the good deals American consumers are getting this holiday season. But the same forces are keeping wages down, and are even on the verge of eliminating many of the low-wage retail and related service jobs many Americans now need to make ends meet.Comments (521)Simon GoetzCopywriter. Ne\u0027er-do-well-off.I\u0027m selling dope, straight off the iPhone. Are you saying that you\u0027re actually selling drugs using your iPhone? We ran it by Marketing and they love your energy, but insist the copy is way off brand.CommentsJay Scarfone and William StillmanSince Oz is about to celebrate its 75th anniversary next year, here\u0027s a fun peek at a few details that may have escaped the attention of even the most ardent Ozophiles.Comments (415)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorSo ruled the judge, paving the way for the largest municipal bankruptcy in our nation\u0027s history.

WashingtonAuthor, \u0027Real Money Answers for Every Woman: How to Win the Money Game With or Without a Man\u0027When it comes to our relationships, money is not the issue many people believe it is. Money, that little green piece of paper in your wallet, in and of itself, is powerless. It\u0027s actually what the money represents to two different individuals that can be problematic, as well as their communication or lack thereof around the topic.CommentsRobert ScheerEditor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027Even if, like me, you don\u0027t fall into one of those categories and also take issue with the Catholic Church\u0027s teachings on a number of contested social issues, it is difficult to deny the inherent wisdom and clarity of the pontiff\u0027s critique of the modern capitalist economy.Comments (65)Bob CescaManaging Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowYou\u0027ve probably heard the scuttlebutt about the U.S. allegedly \"closing\" its embassy at the Vatican. It\u0027s a lie.Comments (461)Dan LyonsMarketing fellow at HubSpot and creator of \u0027The Secret Diary of Steve Jobs\u0027Why is this incredibly tight-lipped company suddenly showing off prototypes? The answer is that these drones were not designed to carry packages, but to give a lift to Amazon\u0027s image.Comments (116)Eric BoehlertSenior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaDespite Clinton\u0027s enviable position with regards to her sky-high name recognition, a proven ability to fundraise, and her strong favorable ratings, the starting point for much of the Clinton coverage lately is She Might Be Doomed.Comments (12)Ju HongResearch assistant, Harvard UniversityI am Ju Hong, the \"heckler\" that interrupted your speech last week. I spoke up not out of disrespect, however, either for you or our country. No, I spoke up -- and am writing to you now -- to ask that you use your executive order to halt deportations for 11.5 million undocumented immigrant families.Comments (663)Mailet LopezFounder, IHadCancer.comAs I was immersed in a few feet of water, holding my breath with my eyes closed, I became entrenched in living in the moment -- the distractions which usually plague my mind were no longer present.CommentsMing TheinCommercial photographer, writer and photographic instructorHow many times have you looked at the work of a photographer and thought -- not only is there something remarkably consistent about his or her style that makes the creator instantly identifiable, but also makes me as the viewer feel a certain way? Wonder no longer.CommentsPeter Van BurenAuthor, \u0027We Meant Well\u0027 and the upcoming \u0027Ghosts of Tom Joad, A Story of the #99Percent\u0027What if Edward Snowden was made to disappear? No, I\u0027m not suggesting some future CIA rendition effort or a who-killed-Snowden conspiracy theory of a disappearance, but a more ominous kind.CommentsDr. Michael J. BreusClinical Psychologist; Board Certified Sleep SpecialistIf our preferences for sleep and wake times are strongly influenced by genetics and biology, what are we to do when faced with inclinations that don\u0027t match up with the demands and responsibilities of our lives?Comments (110)EricSmithAuthor, Publishing ProfessionalAh, the wingman. An important role not just in the world of dating and episodes of How I Met Your Mother, but also in the world of literature.CommentsJohn GeogheganAuthorYes, Elf has its moments, including almost every scene with Will Ferrell, but it experiences so many missteps that unless you squint real hard, this is one holiday film that doesn\u0027t quite deliver.Comments (141)Dr. Karin L. SmithsonTherapist, Educator, Writer, Motivational Speaker. Spirituality Expert. Brave Mom of 3. DoctorKarin.comPeople often forget to check in on the parents.
