{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundWhat if we looked at violence in America as a public health crisis rather than a crime problem? What if we look for promising practices and expanded the ones that work to eliminate the epidemic of violence that keeps our graveyards, jails, and prisons full? That is exactly the approach recommended by a panel of the nation’s leading gun violence researchers in a report released this week by the Institute of Medicine. Convened by the federal government in the wake of the Newtown shooting, the panel provides a national road map for the research that needs to be done to prevent gun violence and improve public safety, especially for our most vulnerable.Comments (201)Gary HartPresident, Hart International, Ltd.It is one thing for senior members of Congress to say, about complex defense questions, \"I trust the experts.\" It is quite another thing for presidents to do so. It is impossible to be a competent commander in chief, as required by the Constitution, without preparing for that role.Comments (133)John PavleyCTO @ The Huffington Post, BloggerWith each Game of Thrones episode we struggle with whom to invest our emotions so that we\u0027re not left with that aching numbness in the pit of our collective stomachs when a favorite character dies. One character I\u0027m especially worried about is Daenerys Targaryen.Comments (30)Nathan SchneiderEditor, Killing the BuddhaWhat do we really mean by God, and what could count as proof? As many of these attempts at proof reveal, the line between God and no God has often been thinner than we\u0027re now led to believe.Comments (1,115)David BlaineIllusionistLearning to hold my breath for 17 minutes was an exciting challenge, but here, there was no block of ice, or coffin lid, or even a deck of cards separating me from the crowd.Comments (136)Norman LearFounder, People for the American WayWith all there is to care about in this world, why does a star of Tom Cruise\u0027s magnitude choose to hie off to a remote land to say nice things about a group of stores he isn\u0027t likely to be caught alive in? Clearly, Tom was there because he cared, and that fills me with wonder.CommentsDr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarStriving for gender equality both in and out of the workplace doesn\u0027t mean women should be striving to emulate, \"overtake,\" or actually be men. Whatever women choose to do -- hug, kiss, handshake -- it\u0027s key to embrace the choice and approach the movement with confidence and ease.Comments (23)John FarrEditor, bestmoviesbyfarr.comThis Sunday the thoroughly original, impossibly talented Johnny Depp hits the milestone age of 50. Does this mean he\u0027s actually middle-aged? No, it can\u0027t be.Comments (64)Jeff JarvisAuthor, \u0027Public Parts\u0027 and \u0027What Would Google Do?\u0027This is a story about transparency and the lack of it. It is a story about secrecy and its damages. It is a story about principles that are being flouted. I am asking for government to behave according to principles. I am also asking companies to do so.CommentsJason Apuzzo and Govindini MurtyFalling Skies seems most likely to be remembered as another distinguished entry in Steven Spielberg\u0027s huge body of work as a director and producer of science fiction.Comments (19)Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOThere is one thing worse than addressing a problem with imperfect solutions. It is not addressing the problem when better solutions are available. Yet this is what seems to happen every month in reaction to the highly-watched employment report.Comments (256)Arianna HuffingtonThis week, Bianca Bosker puts the spotlight on Joel Osteen\u0027s efforts to spread God\u0027s word through social media, and Ryan J. Reilly looks at the hunger strikes that have brought attention -- if only briefly -- back to Guantanamo, and the fact that President Obama still hasn\u0027t honored his pledge to close the prison camp down.Comments (43)Sarah BeauchampWriter, editor and drag queen enthusiast; editor, PCMA Convene; blogger, Freelance GingerI wonder what LGBT pride looks like in areas that are heavily influenced by religion, or areas that are so isolated from queer culture that the nearest gay bar is two hours away. These are questions that will take photographer Christian Hendricks below the Mason-Dixon Line for a six-week journey this August.Comments (197)Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoIf government officials are permitted to keep their actions secret from the American people, all sorts of mischief is possible. Human nature being what it is, we can be sure that, in the long run, secrecy can -- and will -- be used by public officials (who are no better or worse than the rest of us) to hide stupidity, corruption, partisan abuse, discrimination, ineptitude, and outright criminality.Comments (210)James KooleAccomplished pessimist, marathon runner and dadIf he says he held his breath underwater for 17 minutes and four seconds, and that he did it through intense training and a deep understanding of the physiology of his own body, then that should be good enough. I should take him at his word. I want to believe.CommentsThe Rev. Jacqueline J. Lewis, Ph.D.Senior Minister, Middle Collegiate ChurchOn Sunday at Middle Church, my white husband and I will celebrate Loving Day and the landmark case that gave us the right to marry and live with each other. We will celebrate in hope that the Supreme Court will once again change the story, that it will rule on Prop 8 and DOMA in such a way that all couples have the right to marry in every state in our union.Comments (94)Peter ScheerExecutive Director, First Amendment CoalitionFirst came news accounts of the government\u0027s use of armed drones in the targeted killing of suspected terrorists abroad. Then came the revelations about government surveillance programs tapping into data on phone calls, emails and more. These activities are, in fact, linked.CommentsRozanne GoldChef and authorA new chocolate bar called Dulcey Chocolate Bar is a \"blond\" chocolate and it is like no other chocolate you\u0027ve tasted. I expect there will be numerous copycats pretty soon.CommentsConrad BlackAuthor and HistorianDespite the immense importance of the battle for Quebec to the whole Western world, and the huge mythology that has been built about it, from both sides, it was an almost accidental and very close-run engagement.CommentsJames ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Back in the 1970s, there really wasn\u0027t much of an Arab American community. Most people of Arabic descent didn\u0027t even identify as \"Arab American.\" The Washington I see today is dramatically different from the city I came to 35 years ago.Comments (11)Steven RaichlenGrilling Authority, www.barbecuebible.comWhere there is a man and a grill, there is a gadget.Comments (14)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorWhat we have here is a high stakes game of musical chairs, as payrolls grow at a steady, if not-that-impressive, clip, essentially adding chairs to the game. Meanwhile, more players are coming off the sidelines, looking for places to sit.Comments (33)Laura Arrillaga-AndreessenFounder of Stanford Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society; Founder of Silicon Valley Social Venture Fund (SV2); Author, NYTs Besteller \u0027Giving 2.0: Transform Your Giving and Our World\u0027There is huge demand for philanthropic knowledge and tools, and vastly insufficient supply to meet this critical need. By making all my materials freely available through Giving 2.0 ProjectU, I am on a mission to extend philanthropy education to colleges globally and far beyond campus walls.CommentsEthan CaseyAuthor, \u0027Home Free: An American Road Trip\u0027We can, and should, be angry to learn that all of our communications and movements have been secretly monitored for years. But we can\u0027t escape our own responsibility by claiming to be surprised.Comments (138)Jordan K. TurgeonLifestyle Blog Editor, The Huffington PostI\u0027m always searching for new workout music, and the main thing I look for -- especially when it comes to running tunes -- is a song with a solid, quick beat.CommentsMontserrat DomínguezEditorial Director, El Huffington PostTelling, opining, or analyzing what is happening is no longer the job exclusively of journalists or of daily columnists: on HuffPost, anyone is invited to do it, just as they are on Twitter and Facebook. Thank you, bloggers; thank you, readers. HuffPost Spain would be impossible without you.CommentsLisa ShufroTEDMED\u0027s managing editor and producerI pulled the card out from my pocket. It reminded me that famous or not, everyone gets scared when they risk failure -- even David Blaine.CommentsPaul RieckhoffFounder, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of AmericaThe hundreds of thousands of brave veterans waiting for VA disability claims deserve to hear directly from the president. Although it is great to hear that the president is taking this issue seriously, the president needs to address many unanswered questions.Comments (31)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistBy the time they\u0027ve graduated, most college students have completed four years of grueling book learning and are eager to hear a more practical lesson about the real world into which they\u0027re entering.CommentsSusan LandauAuthor, \"Surveillance or Security? The Risks Posed by New Wiretapping Technologies\"The invasiveness of this data is hard to underestimate. It is data that reveals where every connected person is during the day, with whom they speak, when, how often.Comments (189)David BromwichProfessor of Literature at YaleThe security policy of the U.S. government from Cheney to Obama has passed from secret surveillance of communications abroad to secret surveillance of all communications at home. In what stages did it happen? Some day the history will be written; for now, it is instructive to rehearse the facts.Comments (486)Brandon Diamond, 2013. 8.06Norman Lear, 2013. 8.06Tom Teicholz, 2013. 8.06John Pavley, 2013. 8.06Robert J.
