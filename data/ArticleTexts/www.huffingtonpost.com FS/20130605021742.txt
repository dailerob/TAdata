{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Howard FinemanEditorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupBarack Obama was so focused and organized in Ohio for his reelection last year that he had 1,000 neighborhood teams in place in the state a year before Election Day. His Ohio message was clear and sharp: the country was facing an historic “make or break moment for the middle class,” and his work on health care and the auto-industry rescue were evidence of his enduring commitment. This famously aloof president assembled an unrivaled system of person-to-person, face-to-face and email-to-email contact –- a writ-large 21st century version of the 20th century Chicago ward politics, only without the patronage. Where is all of that now?Comments (2,875)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistTyra Banks got called \"Lightbulb Head.\" Chris Colfer was stuffed into lockers. Rihanna was mocked for not being \"black enough.\" And as for Howard Stern, he had to go to judo school just to learn to defend himself. And all of them not only survived, but thrived.Comments (92)Julian AssangeEditor-in-Chief and Founder, WikiLeaksIn the end it is not Bradley Manning who is on trial. His trial ended long ago. The defendant now, and for the next 12 weeks, is the United States. A runaway military, whose misdeeds have been laid bare, and a secretive government at war with the public. They sit in the docks. We are called to serve as jurists. We must not turn away.Comments (502)Noam ChomskyInstitute Professor emeritus, MIT Department of Linguistics and PhilosophyImagine you\u0027re an historian 100 years from now -- assuming there are any historians 100 years from now, which is not obvious -- and you\u0027re looking back at what\u0027s happening today. You\u0027d see something quite remarkable.Comments (303)Jen HatmakerSpeaker and AuthorWe are limping, limping across the finish line, folks. I tapped out somewhere in April and at this point, it is a miracle my kids are still even going to school.Comments (388)Ryan J. ReillyJustice ReporterIn what was almost certainly the first time the Obama administration subpoenaed a journalist to testify before a grand jury, federal prosecutors wound up letting the reporter off the hook. The reason: I had class.CommentsAndrew M. CuomoGovernor, New York StateFor too long New York\u0027s laws have not properly protected women\u0027s rights. These are significant problems, and big issues to tackle. But in New York, that\u0027s what we have always done.Comments (47)Desmond Tutu and Chen GuangchengAs we approach the 25th anniversary of China\u0027s crackdown in Tiananmen Square, world leaders have the opportunity to distinguish themselves from leaders of the past who, for the sake of economic progress or in the name of \"national security,\" have turned a blind eye to atrocities committed by Chinese leaders against their own citizenry.Comments (50)Derek ShearerProfessor of Diplomacy at Occidental College and former US ambassadorOf course, there is no shortage of weighty issues for Obama and Xi to discuss when they meet at the Sunnylands retreat on June 7th and 8th. But both countries would gain from an expansion of cooperative green activities.Comments (119)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; host, \u0027The Breakdown\u0027; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureRespected economist John Kay is about to make a public statements which essentially says that the world economy is a ticking time bomb and global markets are a lit fuse.Comments (30)Heather ArnetCEO, Women and Girls Foundation of Southwest Pennsylvania; Board Member, Ms. Foundation for Women and Women\u0027s Funding NetworkAbercrombie didn\u0027t turn down the girls\u0027 ideas because they were not clever enough. They turned them down because to do business with a diverse group of smart teenage girls would be a \"good guy\" move and as Tom Lennox himself said to me, our brand is being \"the bad guy.\"Comments (128)Jeff DanzigerPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideComments (80)Jeffrey SachsDirector, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \u0027The Price of Civilization\u0027Kennedy\u0027s success teaches us about problem solving in our own time, whether to avert war or save the planet from human-induced environment catastrophe. Peace and environmental sustainability are possible, but never inevitable.Comments (44)Lea GroverWriter and toddler-wranglerAs they asked me why I was sad, why I was tired, why I wasn\u0027t dancing, all I could do was stare at the three tiny faces I\u0027d brought into the world, and try to imagine what it would feel like to feel absolutely nothing about them.Comments (38)Danny GloverActorThe workers of South Africa have more freedom than the workers of Mississippi. As long as powerful corporations such as Nissan can use fear and threats to keep workers weak and without a voice, we will not be a land of opportunity for all.Comments (19)Brandon L. GarrettRoy L. and Rosamond Woodruff Morgan Professor of Law, University of VirginiaFirst, although Maryland\u0027s law was limited to collection from those arrested for \"serious\" offenses, nothing in the opinion suggests that this limitation is of constitutional importance. In fact, the opinion\u0027s reasoning suggests the contrary. What is a \"serious\" offense, anyway?CommentsW. Kamau BellComedian, Host of Totally Biased on FXCould it have been better? Sure? I certainly could have done a better job of playing traffic cop. But it was exactly what I wanted it to be: a well-mannered, intelligent, often funny, and always impassioned discussion about a sensitive and charged issue that you rarely see on TV.Comments (103)Adrian GrenierActor, Filmmaker, EntrepreneurI want to welcome you to Wreckroom, a music space in the basement of my Brooklyn home dedicated to supporting emerging bands. I\u0027m calling it a music incubator with label services. Perhaps not unheard of, but we\u0027re different in that we require our bands to give back.CommentsNeale Donald WalschWriterI don\u0027t mind when people use the Bible as their Source and Authority on matters of spiritual consequence, but I do have a problem with people who choose only those verses that suit their purpose, then ignore anything and everything that does not.Comments (418)Michael W. WatersPastor, Joy Tabernacle A.M.E. Church, Dallas, Texas, www.joytabernacleame.orgThe greatest injustice to Medgar Evers\u0027 legacy is not his death, but the failure of subsequent generations of Americans to tell his story.CommentsStephanie RuhleAnchor, Bloomberg TelevisionWhat if he\u0027s right? Is it bias that leads to the current situation or reality? Are there hundreds of women who want to be macro traders that are being held back by the men or the establishment? Or do their skills really vanish the moment they have a child?CommentsRobert ScheerEditor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027The United States has spent well over $3 trillion on its Iraq War, while suffering and inflicting much mayhem. Yet it is the studiously neutral government of China that has most clearly benefited from George W. Bush\u0027s folly.Comments (98)Alpita ShahInternational finance lawyer at a global law firmA few years ago, my mom was diagnosed with cancer for the second time. At that point, I had been in government and international service for over a decade; I had begun questioning whether exporting Western capitalism to developing countries was how I wanted to spend the rest of my life.CommentsBernard-Henri LévyFrench philosopher and writerWho are these demonstrators at Taksim Square and those who, in the country\u0027s other cities, have followed their lead?Comments (23)Christopher RosenEntertainment editor, Huffington PostThere\u0027s another way to look at the disappointing $27 million that \"After Earth\" earned during its opening weekend: What would this film have grossed without Will Smith on the poster?Comments (222)Tom AngellFounder and Chairman, Marijuana MajorityWhile marijuana use rates between blacks and whites are comparable, blacks are nearly four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession.Comments (71)Abraham H. FoxmanNational Director, Anti-Defamation LeagueWhile it is a marvelous medium for education, communication, entertainment and commerce, the ways in which the Internet is being used to disseminate and promote hateful and violent beliefs and attitudes are astounding, varied and continually multiplying.Comments (11)Mike HoganExecutive Arts and Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post Media GroupI can\u0027t decide if I envy or pity those of you who didn\u0027t know what was coming in this episode ... In truth, knowing that the episode would end the way it did cast a pall over everything that came before.Comments (919)Rocky KistnerMedia associate, NRDCMore than two months after ExxonMobil\u0027s 65-year-old Pegasus pipeline burst and spewed a gusher of thick Canadian tar sands oil through Mayflower, AR, and into a marsh on Lake Conway -- the state\u0027s most popular fishing spot -- residents are still complaining of health problems.Comments (752)Raymond J. LearsyAuthor, \u0027Oil and Finance: The Epic Corruption Continues\u0027Clearly there is a correlation between Middle East tensions and high oil prices. Are we seeing a replay of Russian policies that solidified Iranian intransigence on matters nuclear, thereby exacerbating those tensions to bring about significantly higher oil prices?Comments (13)Julie Carlson MillerConsultantI think I always knew that being pale in a tan-worshipping world was an uphill climb. After all, being bronzed is associated with beauty, health and vibrancy. Being fair-skinned is considered ghostly, sickly and unsexy. But who would have guessed this mindset started as young as six?Comments (16)Maggie Sergio, 2013. 4.06Elysabeth Alfano, 2013. 4.06Kathy Ko Chin, 2013. 4.06Greta Van Susteren, 2013. 4.06Stephanie Ruhle, 2013. 4.06Foodbeast, 2013. 4.06Brandon L.
