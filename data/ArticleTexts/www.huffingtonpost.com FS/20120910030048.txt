{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Afghanistan. Mitt Romney didn\u0027t even mention it in Tampa. Clint Eastwood did, and got a big applause by asking Invisible Obama why he won\u0027t bring the troops home in short order. It\u0027s not a bad question -- especially given the president\u0027s promise in Charlotte to \"use the money we\u0027re no longer spending on war to pay down our debt and put more people back to work...it\u0027s time to do some nation-building right here at home.\" But despite sky-high unemployment right here at home and a war price tag of $2 billion a week, the president stuck with his plan to withdraw from Afghanistan by 2014. He opened his acceptance speech by harkening back to his 2004 convention keynote. Perhaps he should have harkened back to 2002, when he declared, \"I\u0027m not opposed to all wars. I\u0027m opposed to dumb wars.\" Afghanistan has become a dumb war. It\u0027s time to get out.Read Post | Comments (232)Mohamed A.

Don\u0027t try to convince anyone Obama has magically transformed us - just tell them four years is simply not enough time to undo all the hurt caused by biggest economic crash since the Great Depression and the biggest military blunder/lie in our history.Read Post | Comments (1,487)Patton Oswalt, 09/06/12Comedian and writer who lives and drinks in Los AngelesNothing wrong with being rich. Nothing wrong with striving and bettering yourself. But there\u0027s definitely something wrong with people confusing capitalism and corporatism (the latter wants to destroy the former) -- and then demanding everyone else make the same mistake.Read Post | Comments (1,119)Arianna Huffington, 09/03/12The thinking behind the HuffPost Oasis at the national conventions is to help people to better deal with the destructive effects of stress in their lives and to help them be their best selves so they can go out in the world and make a difference in the lives of others.Read Post | Comments (98)Paul Reiser, 09/04/12Actor, writer and stand-up comedianThe term \"gentle giant\" may be overused, but I can\u0027t imagine a soul for whom the words could be better intended.Read Post | Comments (73)Steven Van Zandt, 09/08/12Record producer, songwriter, and musicianWhat the Democrats needed to do this week was very clearly lay out what they had intended to accomplish during the first term and why it didn\u0027t happen.

That\u0027s why I\u0027m running for president and that\u0027s why I approved this message.Read Post | Comments (388)Richard Branson, 09/04/12Founder, Virgin GroupThe war on drugs has had a devastating impact in the U.S. Yet, as Republicans and Democrats gather at their national conventions, neither party has taken a strong stand on the critical need to support drug policy reform. And that\u0027s surprising. Drug reform is not a partisan issue.Read Post | Comments (2,276)Marlo Thomas, 09/06/12Award-winning actress, author, and activistAs kids head back to classrooms this month -- many of them on school buses -- it\u0027s time for parents and guardians to step in and step up to their responsibility, and help avert another year of bullying before it has a chance to begin.Read Post | Comments (69)Harvey Karp, 09/09/12Pediatrician.
