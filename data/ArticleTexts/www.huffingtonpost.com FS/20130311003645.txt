{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, Rand Paul mounted an old-fashioned, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington-style filibuster against President Obama\u0027s nominee to head the CIA, John Brennan. The primary issue at hand was the new-fashioned issue of drone strikes. During the marathon monologue, Paul asked, \"Where is the Barack Obama of 2007?\" In fact, one could also ask: where were the Democrats of 2007? Paul was joined by only one Democrat, Sen. Ron Wyden, even though if the Bush administration had acted on drones the way the Obama administration is, there would have been dozens of Democrats up in arms. Of course, the hypocrisy extends to Republicans, many of whom -- after having supported the Patriot Act, warrantless wiretapping, show-your-papers laws, and torture -- have suddenly discovered civil liberties. Brennan wound up getting confirmed but, at least in the process, the bone-headed right/left way of looking at American politics was rather spectacularly scrambled.Read Post | Comments (153)David Bromwich, 03/09/13Professor of Literature at YaleA mixture of aesthetic admiration for the bombing and bafflement at the meaning of the Iraq war was common even then and remains so today. Indifference to the mass suffering and deaths inflicted on Iraqis by the unprovoked American attack of March 2003 has been an unaltered fact of American public discussion in the past decade.Read Post | Comments (271)Gary Hart, 03/09/13President, Hart International, Ltd.The drone is new and effective and, for the time being, we own it. But not for long. As with almost every new weapon, its use is outrunning the law, ethics, and morality required by civilization to govern its use.Read Post | Comments (275)Arianna Huffington, 03/06/13The devastating consequences of that war will continue for decades, but a full accounting has still yet to happen. Allowing the toxic mixture of lies, deception and rationalizations that led to that war to go unchallenged makes it more likely that we will make similar tragic mistakes in the future. So I hope we can use this moment to assess what really happened, to look back in order to look forward.Read Post | Comments (842)Simon Johnson, 03/07/13Author, \u0027White House Burning: The Founding Fathers, Our National Debt, and Why It Matters To You\u0027The Justice Department\u0027s budget documents prominently quote Thomas Jefferson: \"The most sacred of the duties of government [is] to do equal and impartial justice to all its citizens.\" The attorney general just told Congress and the country that this principle no longer applies to very large financial institution.Read Post | Comments (209)Maria Shriver, 03/07/13Award-winning journalist, best-selling author and activistI hope that as we continue this conversation, we do so with the understanding that no one woman\u0027s experience is the same, that we all have different choices to make, and that we all have something vitally important to bring to the table.Read Post | Comments (204)Larry King, 03/06/13Iconic television and radio interviewer, online at #LarryKingNow on @OraTVI found Hugo Chavez conflicting. In a strange way, he was extraordinarily easy to like, but of course many people -- both good and bad -- who rise to prominence can be that way. Chavez was larger than life. He was very engaging.Read Post | Comments (102)Marian Wright Edelman, 03/09/13President, Children\u0027s Defense FundGun violence is an urban problem. Gun violence is a suburban, small town, and rural problem. Gun violence is a problem in states with strong gun laws because guns still travel in from states next door.Read Post | Comments (452)Dr. Philip Zimbardo, 03/08/13Psychologist, AuthorWhy did some kids give in and start down that slippery slope of evil, while others resisted and stayed on the right side of that line separating good from evil?Read Post | Comments (1,175)Marlo Thomas, 03/08/13Award-winning actress, author and activistOne of the worst phrases I\u0027ve ever heard is \"empty calories.\" Who wants to ingest extra calories that are doing absolutely nothing for us? But many of us are doing that on a daily basis.Read Post | Comments (100)Robert Redford, 03/04/13Actor, director and environmental activistIt is time to take a hard stance on Keystone XL. We need a clear evaluation of the damage to our health and environment that will result from this dirty energy project. And then we need to reject the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline.Read Post | Comments (342)Jared Bernstein, 03/08/13Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorUnemployment is still high, the labor force participation rate shows evidence of continued weak demand, and that\u0027s taking its toll on wage growth. We\u0027ll need a lot more months like this to get back on track.Read Post | Comments (204)Jeffrey Sachs, 03/09/13Director, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \u0027The Price of Civilization\u0027Spending is not spending. The U.S. needs productive public investments, not wasteful spending. We need to modernize our infrastructure, retool our energy system, make our cities more resilient, and help to train a new productive labor force.Read Post | Comments (286)Valerie Jarrett, 03/07/13Senior Advisor and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsWith the re-authorization of the Violence Against Women Act, thousands of law enforcement officers will be better equipped to stop violence before it starts, and respond to calls of help when they are needed.Read Post | Comments (659)Rainn Wilson, 03/05/13ActorSometimes the hours tick away quite slowly and you find yourself obsessively checking the clock, almost willing it to hit 6 p.m., when you can gorge on smoothies and quesadillas. \"The Fast\" in the Baha\u0027i Faith is certainly misnamed. It should be called \"The Slow\" for the way time plods throughout the day.Read Post | Comments (198)Russell Simmons, 03/07/13Founder, GlobalGrind.comWith smokescreens and a barrage of bullets, the NRA is intentionally playing into the fears of a very few people.

Stone, 03/05/13Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoBarriers to achieving equal respect, equal dignity and equal rights for gays and lesbians through the political process remain daunting, and this is especially true at the state level, where a substantial majority of jurisdictions still fervently oppose equal rights.Read Post | Comments (191)Ann Brenoff, 03/09/13Senior Writer, The Huffington PostBarbie, the missile-breasted doll who never ages, actually turns 54 today. And while it\u0027s not one of those milestone birthdays -- the ones that end in a 0 or a 5 -- we think we know how she\u0027s feeling about this one.Read Post | Comments (51)Terrence Howard, 03/06/13Academy Award-nominated American film and stage actor, and singerI loved my mother dearly, more than anything. She is an irreplaceable woman and there is not a day that goes by that I don\u0027t think about her. I lost my mom to colon cancer after a six-year-hard fought battle with the disease. She died too young. She was diagnosed at age 50 and gone by 56.Read Post | Comments (87)Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, 03/08/13U.S. Senator from New YorkIt is deeply troubling that in 2013, our work is not done and the need to continue this fight remains. If we\u0027ve learned one thing from the recent attempts to disenfranchise voters around the country, it\u0027s that the Voting Rights Act continues to be a vital tool in the fight.Read Post | Comments (83)Bob Cesca, 03/08/13Political Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowThe lack of nuance, as well as the lack of a sense of history on both the far-right (and the far-left for that matter) is eerily coincidental. It\u0027s important to have oversight on drones, but let\u0027s get real here.Read Post | Comments (1,575)Michelangelo Signorile, 03/08/13Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesIt\u0027s certainly a great thing for an ex-president to weigh in with a reversal and give his opinion to the Supreme Court. And I commend Clinton for his evolution. But that doesn\u0027t remove this damaging act from Clinton\u0027s legacy.Read Post | Comments (209)Christine Lagarde, 03/08/13Managing Director, IMFToday, on International Women\u0027s Day, we see both amazing achievements and formidable challenges. But I am an optimist and see beyond these challenges; our daughters and granddaughters will have even better opportunities than women have today.Read Post | Comments (92)Tavis Smiley, 03/05/13PBS talk show host, PRI radio hostRead Post | Comments (64)Barry Levinson, 03/05/13Academy Award-winning director, screenwriter and producerIt came to me like a bolt of lightning. I was watching the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills and reading about sequestration at the same time when this amazing idea came into my head.
