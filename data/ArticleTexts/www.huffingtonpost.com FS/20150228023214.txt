{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Worrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsIn general Republican thought, poverty is not something caused by society into which some people are unfortunate enough to fall. Rather, poverty is something people fall into by their own failures, and it is also something that they can leave behind by climbing the ladder of success. If poverty persists, the argument goes, it is not because that ladder is somehow absent but because poverty persists whenever political and social conditions conspire to prevent a sufficient number of people from climbing the ladder of success with all the levels of skill and vigor necessary to the task. And the big criminal here, for many Republicans, is invariably the federal government itself. But if the Republican presidential hopefuls are genuinely concerned with the plight of the least well-off among us, they will need to consult more widely than simply economists drawn from libertarian and conservative think-tanks.Firas Kittaneh wants to disrupt the mattress industry. And the success of his online mattress company Amerisleep is about more than people\u0027s increased willingness to buy a mattress online without every trying it out in a showroom. It\u0027s about something much bigger: our changing attitude toward sleep.The faith community must remind the world that evil can be overcome, and that individuals involved in evil systems and practices can be redeemed. But how to overcome evil is a very complicated theological question, which requires much self-reflection. In trying to figure out how to overcome evil, it is often helpful to first decide how not to.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersThe outcome of the retrial, and its timeframe, remain uncertain. But more importantly, Mr. Fahmy should not be subjected to this process at all.LawyerAttempting to make good on its \"all of the above\" energy strategy, the Obama administration recently floated proposals for oil development that have infuriated members of Congress on both coasts, but for very different reasons.Senior Writer, Union of Concerned ScientistsWhat all the sound and fury misses is that for the Palestinians there is no meaningful Obama-Netanyahu rift. Indeed US-Israeli relations have never been stronger, nor more damaging to the prospects for peace and justice and for the very survival of the Palestinian people.Author, The Battle for Justice in PalestineHe\u0027s at a point in life where he could really use fatherly advice. He\u0027s also at an age where he\u0027s convinced his dad knows nothing. That\u0027s why I wanted to share this.Freelance writerWe all have a responsibility to promote the common good, and government is the principal mechanism through which we serve it. Let\u0027s not substitute the arbitrary and sometimes passing nature of individual altruism for what is in fact a continuing shared obligation.Professor Emeritus, Union Institute \u0026 UniversityRemember that this is an age of outsourcing, downsizing, the near-death experience of the global financial system and -- for developed economies -- competition from places that don\u0027t particularly care about their employees\u0027 emotional well-being.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarFew fictional characters, particularly from television, have been as enduring in the public consciousness, memorable and profound as Spock, and few actors have both inhabited and created a character as fully and brilliantly as Leonard Nimoy did with Spock.lincolnmitchell.comThe BATFE has introduced a proposed executive branch rule regarding ammunition that will likely pivot the election cycle back towards the same driving forces that caused so many blue states to turn red in the November 2014 midterm.Systemic Risk and Global Stability Observer; Architect of Risk Measurement SystemsYour stomach\u0027s feats should be celebrated, not shamed. And therefore, the stomach should be displayed with, yes, I\u0027ll say it, pride. Your umbilical cord connected you, your tummy, and your mother. Without that belly, you wouldn\u0027t be here.Online community for teens promoting positive body imageFrom October 15, 2014 to January 11, 2015, I ran a rather peculiar experiment... traveling from Paris to New York, and spending 90 days there without Internet, computer or a cell phone. Why? I needed to disconnect in order to better reconnect in a hyper-connected environment.Blogger, Footprint New YorkEveryone knows someone who shares way too much on Facebook. Too much information about the awards your children have won or too many pictures of the food you\u0027re about to eat. So I offer this advice: there are the 10 things that you should avoid posting on Facebook.Architect, attorney, badass mother writer and the author of an irreverent novel, Thin Rich Bitches.Sarye Huggins is a high school senior in Brooklyn\u0027s Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, a community disproportionately plagued by poverty and violence. Her journey from being a smart, shy girl attending some of the poorest and roughest schools in New York City towards becoming a strong, confident young woman has not been easy.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundOnly a negotiated settlement, no matter how unsatisfying, offers the possibility of a stable resolution of the ongoing conflict. Indeed, the alternative may be the collapse of the Ukrainian state and long-term confrontation between the West and Russia, at great cost to all sides.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteGovernor Cuomo has proposed major changes to teacher evaluations in New York State. We want to let you know, from a teacher\u0027s perspective, the changes this law could bring to public schools -- and to our profession -- if it passes.Teacher, Brooklyn New SchoolTeacher, Brooklyn New SchoolThe veto is just step one. Now, President Obama needs to move forward and reject Keystone XL once and for all. Pipeline opponents will be working even harder in this home stretch to make sure the [resident follows through and issues a real rejection.May Boeve is the Executive Director of 350.org, a global campaign to fight climate change.The comrades of Podemos are the only ones in Europe who have seriously dared to take this step and construct a vertical axis from a movement of a new potentiality and unprecedented power, organizing without demagoguery or subterfuge a pathway out of grassroots democracy.Philosopher, militant and writer, authorActivist and translatorThis year marks the 80th anniversary of America\u0027s best-selling board game, Monopoly. And while many folks might fib about their age, Hasbro\u0027s accounting of the game\u0027s birth is quite the tall tale.Filmmaker, Activist, FatherEven though the West Village offers \"lesbian nights\" on Fridays in hallowed locales like the Stonewall Inn and the Monster Bar NYC, it\u0027s a far cry from the dozens of spaces and nights for gay men spackled across the Five Boroughs.WriterAs we witness yet again the brutal and bloody consequences of religious intolerance in the form of ISIS, we have a majority of Republicans pining for a Christian America. Proponents of converting the United States into a theocracy do not see the terrible parallel between religious excess in the Middle East and here at home.Scientist and former White House Senior Policy Analyst; Ph.D. in marine biology/neurophysiologyA new report by the UK Waste \u0026 Resources Action Programme (WRAP) projects that reducing food waste by 20 to 50 percent per year by 2030 could save $120 billion to $300 billion annually and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 200 million to 1 billion tons, which is more than the annual emissions of Germany.Senior Fellow at the Bipartisan Policy CenterCitizens of the eurozone countries didn\u0027t know when they formed the monetary union that they were not only losing their sovereign and democratic rights to control their most important macroeconomic policies. They had also ceded this power to people with an anti-social-Europe agenda. Now Greece is trying to get some of that democracy back.Co-director, Center for Economic and Policy Research, Washington, D.C.For decades the common wisdom of parenting manuals was that teenagers feel invulnerable, immortal, and simply perceive less peril in dicey situations and believe they have much more control than they actually do. In short, they underestimate life\u0027s very real risks and dangers. But scientists who study adolescent decision making now dispute this common parenting wisdom.Author, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027The clear implication of the former mayor\u0027s comments is that, unlike President Obama, Giuliani is a patriot and loves America. However, examining his actions it is clear that Rudy Giuliani avoided every chance he had to be a real patriot and serve his country.Senior Fellow, Center for American ProgressModern masculinity is measured not by a stoicism that makes us resemble an inanimate object (a rock, a pillar) but by a capacity for feeling, a capacity to be moved -- even moved to tears. It may once have been true that, as the Cure sang, \"Boys don\u0027t cry.\" But not anymore. Today, real men cry.AuthorIt\u0027s past time to acknowledge the plain fact that students use drugs. Let\u0027s make sure they have the education and protections they need to do so safely.Executive Director, Students for Sensible Drug PolicyWhile I realize that Frank and Claire Underwood -- the scheming, ruthless, and fairly amoral couple at the center of the series -- hardly seem paragons of biblical virtue, hear me out.President, The Lutheran Theological Seminary at PhiladelphiaDespite what we may believe, quite often, we are not really seeking our own happiness at all. Many of us don\u0027t know ourselves well enough to conceptualize what we actually want. We conform to the notions and ideals of our society, our family and other influences that can drown out our own point of view.Psychology expert on relationships, parenting, self-destructive thoughts and suicide; author, \u0027Conquer Your Critical Voice\u0027I\u0027m a committed private-sector loving guy who invests capital for a living, so why the appreciation for the public-sector?
