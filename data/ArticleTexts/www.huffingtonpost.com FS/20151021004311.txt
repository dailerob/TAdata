{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Last week, the Democrats received an unexpected gift from the Federal Reserve Board. Lael Brainard, a member of the Fed\u0027s Board of Governors, gave a speech in which she questioned the need for the Fed to raise interest rates. Brainard pointed out the asymmetric risks in the current situation, where a premature rise in interest rates could lead to slowing growth and reduced employment. By contrast, there is almost no risk that delaying a rate hike will lead to serious problems with inflation, since the inflation rate has long been well below the Fed\u0027s 2.0 percent target. Brainard\u0027s comments are enormously important for the future course of the Fed\u0027s interest rate policy. First and most obviously, she is one of the 10 people currently sitting on the Fed\u0027s Open Market Committee (FOMC) that sets interest rates. However, the Fed has a tradition of trying to move by consensus and it is extremely rare for a governor to dissent.Join us for a conversation, sparked by Jeremy Rifkin\u0027s series on the \"Third Industrial Revolution,\" on climate change, technology and the growing global movement toward solutions.Votes over the CFPB present the same choice today that they always have -- a choice between big banks and predatory lenders on one side and families on the other.

People coming from the Gulf and Europe to visit their families in Gaza lose their jobs, scholarships, or miss their classes -- all for wanting to see a sick parent or meet a new family member.Director of Donor Development at ANERAIn objecting to our op-ed on the importance of ensuring that financial advisors place their clients\u0027 best interest ahead of their personal profits, Dirk Kempthorne, the President and CEO of the American Council for Life Insurers, offers a misleading argument, built on a large, incorrectly cited number.Fmr.
