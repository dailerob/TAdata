{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week, as summer\u0027s vacation high season began (at least in countries other than the unhealthily vacation-averse U.S.), the latest jobs numbers brought more evidence that our economy continues to be on a very extended holiday. We added only 162,000 jobs in July. Over half of them were in the low-wage retail and restaurant sectors, which is likely why hourly wages fell 0.1 percent. At this rate, it will still take up to a decade to erase our 8-10 million job deficit. In response, our leaders in Washington have done... nothing. Actually, worse than nothing, since they\u0027re currently wrangling over which job-killing budget cuts should replace the sequester\u0027s job-killing cuts. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Kerry said that he expected U.S. forces to remain in Afghanistan after 2014. To paraphrase a younger John Kerry, you never have to ask a man to be the last man to die in Afghanistan if you make the mistake of never leaving.Comments (173)David BromwichProfessor of Literature, Yale UniversityThe contemporary notion of a \"trade-off\" between liberty and security assumes that life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are separable goods. They are separate in our experience, so the argument runs, and therefore they must be separate in our political calculations.Comments (512)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundMany Americans heed the CPSC and its recalls of dangerous products to help keep their families safe. But thanks in large part to the work of the gun lobby, guns are specifically not under the CPSC\u0027s jurisdiction and are the only consumer product not regulated for safety.Comments (853)Michael MooreOscar and Emmy-winning DirectorLast week, Bradley Manning was convicted on 20 of 22 counts, including violating the Espionage Act, releasing classified information and disobeying orders. That\u0027s the bad news. The good news is he was found not guilty on the charge of \"aiding the enemy.\" That\u0027s \u0027cause who he was aiding was us, the American people. And we\u0027re not the enemy. Right?Comments (1,159)Arianna HuffingtonI\u0027m in London for the first international edition of our Third Metric conference, discussing a more sustainable definition of success that includes well-being, wisdom, and our ability to wonder and to give back. Why are we taking the conversation international? Because, while creation of the faulty definition of success definitely had significant help from the U.S., it\u0027s clear this is now a global phenomenon.Comments (155)José Ramos-HortaFormer President, East Timor, 1996 Nobel Peace Prize laureateIf the position of Nobel Peace Prize laureate adds authority and force to one\u0027s words, it is better used to encourage calm, dialogue and peaceful resolution than to further polarize.CommentsGreta Van SusterenHost, Fox News\u0027 \u0027On the Record With Greta Van Susteren\u0027If someone has something to say about Abedin, that person should have the courage to step up and put his or her name on it.Comments (43)Carla BuzasiCarla Buzasi is editor-in-chief of The Huffington Post UKOn Tuesday evening at Bafta in London, nearly 300 women -- and a \u0027few good men\u0027 -- gathered to discuss how we redefine success in the 21st century.Comments (27)Russell SimmonsFounder, GlobalGrind.comThe lucky ones, like you and me, owe a real explanation of the problems in our community to the ones who are still living in struggle, not some old, conservative talking points left in the garbage from Mitt Romney\u0027s campaign.Comments (877)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarWhile there\u0027s no longer a question of whether a woman can succeed in \"a man\u0027s world,\" statistics indicate that either the glass ceiling is thicker and lower than we imagined, or that younger women on the way up are finding a way out. Or, quite possibly, both.Comments (277)Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOIt is tempting for lawmakers to ignore the seemingly endless flow of economic data releases, especially as they prepare to take their summer recess. But, please, not this week.Comments (143)Sarah Koppelkamhopeave.wordpress.comHow to talk to your daughter about her body, step one: Don\u0027t talk to your daughter about her body, except to teach her how it works. Don\u0027t say anything if she\u0027s lost weight. Don\u0027t say anything if she\u0027s gained weight. Here are some things you can say instead.Comments (699)Marshall GanzSenior Lecturer in Public Policy, Harvard Kennedy SchoolI was shocked to read this morning of the fact that Jim Messina, manager of President Obama\u0027s 2012 campaign, had marketed himself to the UK\u0027s Conservative Party, while, at the same time, chairing the president\u0027s \"Organizing for Action\" program here in the States.Comments (24)Ram DassSpiritual teacher and best-selling authorWorking with the dying is like being a midwife for this great rite of passage of death.Comments (258)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027The battles over immigration reform and race have weighed heavily on me this summer. They have each become a symbol and a test, for me, of whether we can resurrect \"the common good\" in this nation.Comments (83)Sec. Kathleen SebeliusSecretary of Health and Human ServicesMedicaid expansion is a critical piece of the puzzle to ensure more Americans get the care they need. Expanding Medicaid also reduces the burden of uncompensated care. It injects significant resources into your local economies and local hospitals.Comments (82)Dan DennettCognitive scientist and philosopherIt is a mistake to think that first there was sweetness, sexiness, and cuteness, and then we evolved to love these properties. That\u0027s just about backwardsComments (594)Katie VyktoriahStay-at-home mom and blogger, amotherthing.comA grown man who should know better decided it was OK to step in and \"teach\" my child what it is to be manly. He thought it was OK to judge my child because he was not adhering to HIS idea of what a little boy should be.Comments (8,454)Alan ColmesLiberal political commentator, host of \"The Alan Colmes Show\" on Fox News Radio, publisher of alan.com, author of \"Thank the Liberals … For Saving America\"Seeing liberal bloggers declare victory about how a boycott of these shows\u0027 sponsors led to this makes my hair stand on end for four reasons. First, that\u0027s not at all what happened, as these shows will land elsewhere.Comments (701)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkIt\u0027s simply amazing how many on the right who never cared about \u0027Black issues,\u0027 or the fact that our youth are facing unequal access to education, jobs, housing and higher rates of incarceration, now suddenly want to act as if they are so concerned about what\u0027s going on with us.Comments (521)Kim SimonMother, Wife, Blogger, mamabythebay.comI am a formula mom. I am a breastfeeding mom. I know what it feels like when your breasts \"let-down,\" and I know what it feels like when your heart \"lets-down.\" The beauty of our stories is that we are all feeding with love.Comments (301)Bernard-Henri LévyFrench philosopher and writerWhat about the plan for a moderate Islamist government, the idea of an Islamist succession that would not become just another form of despotism? Whatever happens next in Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood has buried that idea.Comments (256)Elizabeth LicorishFreelance Writer and AuthorAt Lululemon, everything about you is inventoried and measured in terms of \"authenticity\" and \"integrity.\" Which sounds reasonable, until you realize your yoga mat\u0027s on a sweaty, slippery slope. In fact, according to Lululemon\u0027s standards, almost everyone is a lazy, sociopathic scumbag.Comments (657)Sen. Rand PaulU.S. Senator from KentuckyAll children, no matter who they are or where they live, deserve an equal chance to develop their skills and intellect. But today in America, too many kids don\u0027t get that chance.Comments (1,320)Jason WhitlockColumnist, FOXSports.comThe uniqueness of the black American experience and the side effects of that experience are not difficult to relate to, convey or understand. It\u0027s just that most pundits and broadcasters are far too lazy, scared and convinced of viewer ignorance to go beyond simple-minded, attention-grabbing sound bites.Comments (723)Joy GabrielWriter and momIs my body supposed to pretend it didn\u0027t rearrange all my organs and open my rib cage and my hips and grow a new human person and then proceed to feed and nourish that person from the very same body that delivered him, whole and perfect, into the world?Comments (213)Michael SmerconishSiriusXM Radio HostThe O.J. Simpson criminal prosecution was doomed from the moment the trial was moved to downtown Los Angeles, ensuring that the jury looked nothing like the two victims. Might the outcome of the Zimmerman trial have been similarly predetermined -- because of gender?Comments (434)Jordan K. TurgeonLifestyle Blog Editor, The Huffington PostFor me, health means strength. Health means trying each day to treat my body well. That kind of health goes beyond just diet and exercise. It comes in a variety of sizes. And if you don\u0027t carry that size in your store, I\u0027m happy to take my money elsewhere.Comments (97)Sen. Joe ManchinU.S. Senator from West VirginiaEach year, millions of American students rely on the federal student loan program to pursue higher education. For many families, without the ability to pay for their students\u0027 education over a longer term, college would simply be out of reach.Comments (75)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorMitt Romney famously said during his most recent bid for the presidency: \"Corporations are people, my friend.\" Perhaps nothing else better surmises the state of our country than a prominent politician running for the presidency openly advancing such a flawed opinion.Comments (222)Sarah MunirWriterAnd that is where the problem arises. When negative images of your country become part of a global popular culture, subconsciously guilt becomes a part of the national conscience.Comments (234)Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, 2013. 4.08David Finkle, 2013. 4.08Yoani Sanchez, 2013. 4.08Manuel Pastor, 2013. 4.08Carl Safina, 2013. 4.08John Feffer, 2013. 4.08Mike Sweeney, 2013. 4.08Simple.
