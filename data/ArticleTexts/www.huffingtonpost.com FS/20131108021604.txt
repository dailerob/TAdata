{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Howard FinemanEditorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupNo, Obamacare didn’t almost cost Terry McAuliffe his narrow gubernatorial victory in Virginia. But dodging that bullet shouldn’t be much comfort to other Democrats. For one, it’s not clear that implementation of the Affordable Care Act is going to improve or that, even if it does, the law will become more popular. Plus, McAuliffe was saved by two factors that Democrats won’t necessarily be able to repeat elsewhere in 2014: a monumental cash advantage and a local electorate deeply affected by a federal government shutdown. So the lesson of Virginia is obvious: What the Democrats really need is another Ted Cruz-led crisis.Comments (2,135)Bob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowAs the week began, another \"Obamacare\" horror story hit the press, instigating a fleet of outrage-pornographers to continue self-flagellating and screeching about the disastrous Affordable Care Act -- selectively forgetting about actual healthcare horror stories that existed before the law was implemented.Comments (1,036)Sarah Stewart HollandBlogger, bluegrassredhead.comI\u0027m sorry. I need to save $1,100 A MONTH to send my children to college almost 20 years from now?!? That is insanity.Comments (379)Menachem RosensaftProfessor of law and son of Holocaust survivorsThis sordid tale is of far more than academic interest for me: My parents were imprisoned at Auschwitz. I\u0027d be horrified to discover their uniforms advertised on eBay or anywhere else.Comments (35)Bishop Gene RobinsonThe Rt. Rev. V. Gene Robinson, Bishop of New Hampshire, USA. Visiting Senior Fellow at the Center for American Progress.The debate surrounding the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), which just passed in the U.S. Senate, has a number of religious leaders arguing against it. Sometimes, Jesus must just hold his head in his hands with embarrassment.Comments (122)Ann JonesAuthor, \u0027They Were Soldiers: How the Wounded Return From America’s Wars -- The Untold Story\u0027As I followed the sad trail of damaged veterans to write my new book, I came to see how much they and their families have suffered, like Afghans, from the delusions of this nation\u0027s leaders, more powerful and less accountable than themselves.Comments (32)Al FrankenU.S. Senator from MinnesotaAs we debated -- and ultimately passed -- the Employment Nondiscrimination Act (ENDA) this week, I discovered something fascinating: Americans were frankly surprised to learn that in the majority of states, it\u0027s still perfectly legal to fire someone because they\u0027re gay.Comments (27)Madeleine CrumAssociate Books Editor\"Like\" can serve two important, or at least forgivable, functions. The first is to allow a certain tentativeness to a spoken thought.Comments (240)Dan GlickmanVice President of the Aspen Institute and Senior Fellow at the Bipartisan Policy CenterSince coming to Washington in the 1970s, I have learned what qualities make a great leader: a genuine and authentic persona, an optimistic view of the future and a can-do attitude. With this week\u0027s resounding victory, Chris Christie has proved that New Jersey voters believe he has that.CommentsDana StarfieldScreenwriterNovember 1, 2013 was the luckiest and most traumatizing day of my life. Is it too soon to start talking about these weapons of war and the Members of Congress, the guardians of the BOOM, who have supported the reign of domestic terror Americans repeatedly endure?Comments (15)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Pundits who are already describing the victories of Terry McAuliffe in Virginia and Chris Christie in New Jersey as a \"return to the center\" of American politics are confusing the \"center\" with big business and Wall Street.Comments (420)Suzanne Braun LevineFirst editor of \u0027Ms.\u0027 magazine, Writer on Women Over Fifty, Author of: \"You Gotta Have Girlfriends - A Post-Fifty Posse Is Good For Your Health, \u0027HowWe Love Now,\u0027 \u002750 Is the New Fifty,\u0027 and \u0027Inventing the Rest of Our Lives\u0027Why would I never want to be 30 again? Let me count the ways.Comments (29)MJ RosenbergBlogger, Huffington Post, Tikkun, Washington SpectatorThe Republicans will never nominate Governor Chris Christie for president. And the reason is not that he is a moderate. No, the reason is that he stabbed the last GOP nominee in the back.Comments (142)Katie MortonAuthor, 10 Steps to a Blissful Life and teacher at The Monarch CompanyPeople with extraordinary willpower look objectively at other people\u0027s success, admire the hard work that went into it, and use that as inspiration.Comments (32)Radley BalkoSenior Writer and Investigative Reporter, The Huffington PostThere are sardonic artists in Nashville and, alternately, singer/songwriters who treat the stage like a confessional.

In Jack\u0027s story -- in that moment -- I was the villain.Comments (16)Adam WinklerProfessor of Law, UCLATuesday\u0027s gubernatorial election in Virginia was a remarkable setback for the Virginia-based National Rifle Association. Democrat Terry McAuliffe beat Republican Ken Cuccinelli, despite McAuliffe\u0027s support of expansive new gun control laws, like universal background checks and limits on assault rifles and high-capacity magazine.CommentsGrace BucheleBlogger, howibecametexan.comI hope those couple bucks you saved were worth it. Because your cheapness and willingness to rip off and take advantage of a young married couple -- my parents -- has cost me the chance to walk down the aisle in my dream wedding dress.CommentsFernando EspuelasHost of \"The Fernando Espuelas Show\" on Univision America NetworkIn the maelstrom of the shutdown, a debt-ceiling suicide attempt and the cutting off of nutrition support for poor people by Congress, it\u0027s clear that America\u0027s political class has unbounded belief in national stability.Comments (47)Ann BrenoffSenior Writer, The Huffington PostAs a rule, I try not to criticize the choices of others.

What would a day of optimal sleep promotion look like?CommentsMike WeisserMike the Gun GuyTalk to anyone in law enforcement and they\u0027ll tell you that gun violence, like all violence, is best controlled in and by the local communities where it takes place. Sunnyvale could be an isolated incident but it also might be the beginning of a new trend.Comments (155)Lloyd I. Sederer, MDMedical director, New York State Office of Mental HealthGiven the influence on prescribers that the J \u0026 J and other cases reveal, there are just too many ways that care can go awry.
