The holidays, beginning with Thanksgiving, seems to be an understood period of complete wretched excess...READ POST | comments11.24.2005 Patt MorrisonTwo extremes of Thanksgiving memories bookend my childhood, and in an odd way, life in America.READ POST | comments (25)11.24.2005 Charlie CrayIn October 1863, Abraham Lincoln established Thanksgiving as an official national (and federal) holiday to commemorate Union victories during the Civil War.READ POST | comments11.24.2005 David MametREAD POST | comments (42)11.24.2005 Greg GutfeldThank you, Pesticides! If fruits and vegetables were people, we would call what insects do to them \"rape.\" Pesticides are nature\u0027s \"rape whistles.\" Conclusion: People who hate pesticides are probably rapists.READ POST | comments (28)11.24.2005 David Corn\"Do scientists know if there is a God and if God created the world?\" my six-year-old asked.

I was very thankful for that.READ POST | comments (32)11.24.2005 Jeremy PikserI’m thankful my home, my water supply and my electricity have not been blown to shit by US bombs.READ POST | comments (17)11.24.2005 Seth GreenlandI am thankful that, as a union member, when I get sick I don’t have to rob a bank to pay for the treatment I receive.
