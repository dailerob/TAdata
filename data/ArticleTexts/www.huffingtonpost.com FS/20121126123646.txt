{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027As President Obama gets closer to making his deal with the Republicans on the budget, the most important thing to keep in mind is that the fiscal cliff is an artificially contrived trap. Were it not for the two Bush wars and the two Bush tax cuts and the House Republican games of brinksmanship with the routine extension of the debt ceiling, there would be no \"fiscal cliff.\" Rather, there would be a normal, relatively short-term increase in the deficit resulting from a deep recession and the drop in government revenues that it produces. When the economy recovered, the deficit would return to sustainable levels. In the meantime, these deficits are necessary and useful to maintain public spending as a tonic to the economy.Read Post | Comments (231)Steve Clemons, 11/25/12Publisher, \u0027The Washington Note\u0027Is Morsi the kind of leader who will aggrandize total power and then liberalize like a George Washington or Abraham Lincoln? Or is he more like a Lee Kuan Yew who can build a state and the facade of a democratic system while holding tightly to power for decades in all ways that matter?Read Post | Comments (22)Matthew Dowd, 11/24/12Political strategistFear seems like a useful leadership tool, but in the end it is fear that prevents us as individuals, as leaders, as a country, and as a human race from becoming our best self.Read Post | Comments (38)Laurence Watts, 11/25/12Freelance journalist and Board Member of the American Military Partner AssociationI\u0027d been trying to interview Matthew for more than a year, but his manager always managed to find a reason why it was never quite the right time.

It appears that he has never surrendered the Revisionist Zionist goal of a Greater Israel, with an autonomous and pacified Palestinian population that submits to Israel\u0027s diktat. And, in his way of thinking, he\u0027s almost there.Read Post | Comments (404)Maureen Ryan, 11/21/12TV critic, The Huffington PostIt\u0027s easy to come up with a list of a few things a movie about Elizabeth Taylor-Richard Burton should do. \"Liz and Dick\" does absolutely none of these things.

Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorMany deficit scolds are motivated by anti-tax, anti-social insurance, and anti-government ideology, so they\u0027ve got a vested interest in the status quo. But we\u0027re not going to make much progress if policy makers continue to obsess so exclusively on budget deficits instead of the income deficits experienced by the poor and middle class.Read Post | Comments (1,089)Carissa Henry, 11/24/12Recently divorced mother of two, high school librarian in Trenton, GABecause we agreed to remain amicable and on good terms for our two children, I assumed that this divorce would be easier than the messy divorces we witnessed over the years.Read Post | Comments (505)Don McNay, 11/25/12Bestselling author.
