{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week the media edged closer to their Murrow moment. In the 50s, CBS broadcaster Edward R. Murrow took on Sen. Joe McCarthy and his unscrupulous red-baiting, helping bring about McCarthy\u0027s downfall. And this week, the media finally began to call out Donald Trump\u0027s racism and point out the cowardice of those like Paul Ryan, who admitted Trump\u0027s comments about Judge Gonazalo Curiel were the \"textbook definition of racism\" -- and yet continued to endorse him. So the media edged closer to their Murrow moment, but they still have a long way to go, judging by their reaction to Trump\u0027s speech after winning the California primary. Only Donald Trump could be praised for a speech just because it did not include any overt racism. But whether he \"pivots\" to being \"presidential\" or not, we know what he thinks, and we know what \"textbook\" beliefs his policies are based on. \"This is no time,\" said Murrow of McCarthy, \"to remain silent.\" Nor to ignore or euphemize the grave danger we\u0027re facing.You can be deaf to the public\u0027s shouts for only so long. The insurgency of popular discontent that has upended politics this year will continue no matter the results in November. For much too long now it\u0027s been clear that money doesn\u0027t just rule democracy, it is democracy. Until we prove it isn\u0027t.Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanySenior writer, BillMoyers.com. Former senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.Enough is enough kowtowing to the Americans who cling to their weapons for dear life. Enough is enough social media activism without any real calls to action. Enough is enough.Full-time traveler and writer, blogging at TheLitmoLife.comWhat will it take? Not this. This won\u0027t change anything. An apparent terrorist? Fifty or more gay men? What about 20 cute little children between the ages of 6 and 7 at Sandy Hook? Nope. Dozens of other mass shootings this year? Nope. Thousands of gun murders every year? Nope.Writer/director, \u0027The Ledge\u0027; Author, Trials of the Monkey\u0027; President, ScienceDebate.orgDonald Trump\u0027s success in the U.S. is not unique. Europe is being buffeted by similar populist currents. Illiberal, nationalist governments rule Hungary and Poland. Austria nearly elected a right-wing nationalist as president. Anti-EU leftists share power in Portugal.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteAfter the Pulse nightclub massacre, there will be the customary vigils, speeches, and rainbow processions, vows of solidarity, and then the predictable return to business as usual. I am left wondering, amid all the prayers and mourning, wherein lies the responsibility and who is to blame?Trans researcher, mother, writer, and activist.In my years of studying politics at work, I know the \"thin pink line\" women walk to be sure that aren\u0027t disliked. Clinton is liked or else she wouldn\u0027t be where she is today -- a heartbeat away from being the first woman U.S. president.Professor Emerita, USC Marshall School; Author, \u0027The Secret Handshake\u0027 and \u0027Shadow Campus\u0027Why are there so few statesmen left in the Republican Party? Are there no principled Republicans whose loyalty to the nation is greater than their eagerness to win back the White House? No Republican leaders with the courage to stand up and say this is wrong -- that this man doesn\u0027t have the character or the temperament to be president, and his election would endanger America and everything we believe in and stand for?Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027People like Dan Patrick who encourage or in any way condone mass murder of fellow Americans they dislike or disagree with, however obliquely, are unAmerican and should not be in any position of authority in any state or community.Political advisor, writer, novelist, filmmaker, science advocateOne thing is certain: intolerance and hatred inevitably lead to violence and death. Our primary response to the horrific massacre at the Pulse nightclub must be to rededicate ourselves to creating a culturally diverse society that is based on tolerance and respect for other religions, sexual orientations, races and life styles.Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersContrary to those in the media and elsewhere who claimed he was \"far more accepting\" on LGBT issues than other GOP candidates, Donald Trump is proving that he very much will be a force against LGBT equality if elected president.Queer Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostIf you\u0027re hurting like I am right now, thinking about the epidemic of gun violence in this country, but you have not yet contacted your elected representatives to make your voice heard, it\u0027s time. This is our country, and elected officials work for us. Don\u0027t go down without a fight.Writer and comedianWhile Trump\u0027s flaunting of divorces, affairs, and other indiscretions may indicate a certain hubris and lack of regard for public opinion, none of it counts as abuse for everyday American women. The real abuse will come from his policy ideas if he\u0027s elected.Money Editor, Ms. magazine; national gender pay equity consultant, Director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsWe cannot simply applaud the reality of interracial or interreligious households but rather we must work hard to open the conversation about America\u0027s diverse population even wider to be able to include, respect, and perhaps even love, everyone.Whitman dean, author, and engaged citizenPart B drug payment policy. Boring. Obscure. But an ongoing battle over these policies will affect you -- especially what you pay for drugs.Chair of the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the University of PennsylvaniaWell here we are again. Waking up to reports of a mass shooting. This time in Orlando.Law school graduate, writer, human disasterWhen Leah and I were headed to the movies recently, I asked her who her favorite hero was. Waiting to hear the usual superhero response, Leah laughed and said, \"You\u0027re my favorite hero, daddy! Because you\u0027ve always saved the day.\" I smiled.Defensive End for the NFL Houston TexansBlackfish forced SeaWorld to announce that it would discontinue its orca-breeding program, effectively phasing out its orca captivity. That is good, but it is not enough to protect orcas at SeaWorld in the future, or orcas that are or might later be held in other locations.Actress and activistRacism is still deeply rooted in American society and in white culture. Donald Trump has repeatedly taken the racism that is often covert and made it overt, what is usually implicit and made it explicit. Trump has regularly turned racial \"dog whistles\" into bullhorns.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersHillary is the only candidate who has consistently stood on the side of gun safety. She\u0027s the only candidate has stood with gun violence survivors. And she\u0027s the only candidate who has shown the backbone to stand up to the gun lobby\u0027s extreme \"guns everywhere\" agenda.Founder, Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in AmericaThere is nothing more American than our vote. There is too much to lose if we don\u0027t show up. I don\u0027t want someone else deciding if my loved one gets to sleep soundly at night without fear of deportation or how a Latina makes decisions for her future and her body. Do you?Actor and activistIn 2007, I had the incredible opportunity to fly Professor Stephen Hawking, the world\u0027s expert in gravity, into zero gravity aboard a specially-modified Boeing 727-200 aircraft called G-FORCE ONE.Chairman/CEO, XPRIZEMost environmentalists I know are now more optimistic than ever that as a planet we are finally on the road to addressing this crisis. But action, collaboration, and leadership in the White House will make us or break us in the next four years.Author, Producer, AdvocateI met Sebenele, a bright 14 year-old boy with a big smile, this week during a visit to Swaziland to see how my fund is helping UNICEF to support and protect children living with HIV. Swaziland has the highest rate of HIV infection in the world. Twenty-four per cent of children here have lost one or both parents to AIDS and many are themselves now living with HIV. I thought about my own children and how in many ways the things Sebenele enjoys are the same things they do. Yet he told me how he is struggling to continue to take his antiretroviral medicine, which is vital to ensure he stays healthy, because he can\u0027t keep the pills down without any food.UNICEF Goodwill AmbassadorThrough tax-deductible \"charitable\" donations, the Kochs are systematically manufacturing a legion of \"experts\" at universities and think tanks across the country -- and then fighting to place them in Executive Branch positions so they can undermine the government from the inside.Democratic Senator from MassachusettsDemocratic Senator from Rhode IslandDemocratic U.S. Senator from New YorkLike millions of others, I really care about the ocean and can\u0027t just sit back and watch it being destroyed. Having had the huge privilege of swimming with magnificent creatures, I am in total awe of our underwater world.Founder, Virgin GroupDonald Trump shamed himself and his party -- and flunked judicial ethics 101 -- with his flagrantly racist suggestion that an Indiana-born federal judge hearing a lawsuit against his sham Trump University had an \"inherent conflict of interest\" because he was \"of Mexican heritage.\" Putting aside Mr. Trump\u0027s noxious pronouncements, there are situations, unrelated to a judge\u0027s race, ethnicity, gender, or religion, when a genuine conflict of interest exists, and a judge\u0027s recusal is essential for preserving the appearance and reality of judicial fairness central to the nation\u0027s justice system.Senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of LawWhile I am certainly excited that there are a growing number of individual organizations committed to building communities of environmental action, it\u0027s also important to recognize that we can\u0027t create change in isolation. When we work together we can go further, faster and build more blue minds.Actor, filmmaker, entrepreneur and social advocateWhere is your anger at a culture that has more concern for the impact of jailing a rapist than the impact of a rape? Weeks ago, we were told that women needed to be protected. But apparently not from rapists.Writer, speaker, musician, and defender of Oxford comma. Author of \u0027Embracing Grief\u0027Please forgive me for not writing sooner, Mexico. What with summer coming, some overtime at work and preparations for the coming dictatorship, I\u0027m afraid I\u0027ve fallen behind in my correspondence with even my closest friends and trading partners.Editor-at-large for MediaPost; Co-host of public radio\u0027s Peabody Award-winning \"On the Media\"While it\u0027s important to unite in joy throughout this month, it\u0027s equally important to turn our collective attention towards the work left to be done. For trans and gender non-conforming members of the LGBTQI community, every day in this country is a struggle -- a battle not only for equality, but for survival.Blog Editor, Huffington PostBlog Editor, Huffington PostGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
