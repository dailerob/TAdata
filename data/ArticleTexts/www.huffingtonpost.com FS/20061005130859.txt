{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"APFrom abcnews.comAPIf the Foley fallout turns out to be the tipping point when the American public finally turns on the Republican Party and hands control of the House to the Democrats, it won\u0027t be because of Foley\u0027s perverted acts; it will be because of the GOP\u0027s perverted priorities. Not because Foley enjoyed the image of a young boy\u0027s \"cute butt bouncing in the air\" but because Hastert and company have made covering their own butts Job One. The current narrative -- that the American people can\u0027t trust these guys to look after the interests of vulnerable children -- fits in perfectly with the building narrative that the American people can\u0027t trust them in so many other areas. It\u0027s clear they\u0027ll do whatever it takes to hold onto power.READ POST | comments (32)10.04.2006 Shelley LewisWhen his pattern of sexually assaulting staffers, lobbyists, elevator operators, and others came to light, Packwood did what any honorable Republican would do--he blamed it on booze, and went to rehab.READ POST | comments10.04.2006 Amy BergFor both the Catholic Church and the Congress, the well-being of children does not seem to matter enough to rein in the behavior of adults in their own ranks.READ POST | comments10.04.2006 Martin LewisEtymology: Latin exfoliatus, past participle of exfoliare to clean away repugnant detritus.
