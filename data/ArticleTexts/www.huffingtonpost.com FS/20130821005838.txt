{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Even after the collapse in 2008, and the subsequent Dodd-Frank reforms, there are few qualitative changes in the financial industry. The big banks are bigger and more profitable than ever. They are also engaging in the same sort of risky and speculative practices as they did in the pre-crisis years. Summers has to be held largely responsible for this situation also. He was President Obama\u0027s top economic adviser at a time when the administration could have dismantled the major banks since they were insolvent. The Obama administration also could have pushed Congress for stronger measures in Dodd-Frank. Summers had ample opportunity in his prior jobs to demonstrate a commitment to rein in the financial sector. All the evidence shows he pushed in the opposite direction.Comments (173)Katie HurleyChild and Adolescent Psychotherapist, Parenting ExpertLife is far too scripted today. Plans are made. Classes are attended. Craft projects are intended to mimic those found on Pinterest. Gone are the days of free play and creating something out of nothing. Many kids today are simply following a script.Comments (299)Naveen LambaAssociate Partner, Smarter Government, Transportation, and Public Safety, IBM Global Business ServicesWhether you live in Northern Virginia like me, New York, Nairobi, or Nice, road congestion and the ensuing traffic jams aren\u0027t just inconvenient; they can impede economic growth and impact the environment. Imagine how much more productive people are when they\u0027re not stuck in their cars or on the bus several hours per day. The good news is that help is on the way.CommentsDr. Yvonne Bohn, Dr. Allison Hill \u0026 Dr. Alane ParkOB/GYNs and authors of The Mommy Docs\u0027 Ultimate Guide to Pregnancy and BirthCollege comes with big life changes that you need to be prepared for, but it\u0027s important to pay respect to your vagina as well.Comments (72)Rachel WeightI\u0027m all for adventure, going out of my comfort zone, and pushing limits, but I also feel freedom in declaring things I don\u0027t want to do and will not be pressured into doing.Comments (55)Robert ScheerEditor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027Sixty years ago this week the United States successfully staged a coup in Iran to overthrow democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh that a newly declassified CIA document reveals was designed to preserve the control of Western companies over Iran\u0027s rich oil fields.Comments (196)Lauren DucaFellow, The Huffington PostThe recent paparazzi shots of North West draped in a blanket are so indistinguishable that they could be photos of any other baby. They could be photos of a small cat or rhesus monkey. And yet, the media is predictably freaking out.Comments (12)Lisa BelkinSenior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, The Huffington PostWhy do I care? Let’s start by admitting that I do. I watched that door of the Lindo Wing of St. Mary\u0027s Hospital in London for the first glimpse of the new family. I cooed at the new Prince’s little Royal Wave.Comments (104)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkJustice delayed is justice denied. And a dream deferred is a dream unfulfilled.Comments (48)Allison TateWriter, mother of fourThere\u0027s no way to fast forward or take a shortcut when we give a moment to our kids; there\u0027s no app for that. That\u0027s what makes it special.Comments (39)Mark Ruffalo and Wenonah HauterWhile the broad narrative of President Obama\u0027s speech on climate change in June was something to rally around, his support for fracking threatens to exacerbate climate change to the point of no return, while poisoning our water, air and families in the process. Here\u0027s what we need to do.Comments (40)Anita MoorjaniBestselling author of \u0027Dying to Be Me\u0027Many of us are taught from a young age to \"love our neighbors as we love ourselves.\" But learning to love others begins with learning to love ourselves unconditionally first. This seems to be a well-kept secret, which no one taught me as I was growing up.CommentsTimothy KarrCampaign Director, Free Press and SavetheInternet.comThese online agreements are as ubiquitous as the sites that use them. In exchange for using Google to search the Web or Facebook to connect and share information with friends, we surrender much more than we think.Comments (18)Ashley WoodsDetroit Editor, The Huffington PostWhen you work for The Huffington Post, your job is to cover breaking news, not cry over it. But that was my first impulse when I heard that Elmore Leonard, America\u0027s foremost mystery writer of the last century, had passed away at home Tuesday.CommentsThe Daily MealTheDailyMeal.comIt\u0027s just like picking up any other cooking oil, isn\u0027t it? Well, not quite.Comments (116)Janet TavakoliPresident, Tavakoli Structured FinanceBy the time Congress holds a hearing to wag a finger in an executive\u0027s face (right after lauding him), by the time a fringe-dwelling show-trial is launched by the SEC and DOJ, by the time a junior scapegoat is indicted, the damage to investment portfolios will be fully realized. The lesson here is that you are on your own.Comments (16)Helene LernerCEO, Creative Expansions Inc.In order to recharge, you don\u0027t have to take time off from work. All you need is a few minutes a day to reconnect with the things that make you joyful.CommentsMichael BialasEntertainment and sports journalistShania Twain\u0027s bucket list is really more like a deep, romantic wishing well that\u0027s filled with dreams and ambitions, many of them realized whether they\u0027re modest or grand.CommentsBarbara GarsonAuthor, \u0027Down the Up Escalator: How the 99% Live in the Great Recession\u0027A common explanation is that the bad jobs are coming back first and the good jobs will follow. But let me suggest another explanation: the good jobs are here among us right now -- it\u0027s just their wages, their benefits, and the long-term security that have vanished.Comments (255)Beth KohmDeputy Executive Director, PFLAG NationalAbout six months ago my 6-year-old, Joshua, asked, \"Mom, what is \u0027transgender\u0027?\" I explained as best as I could, but I also said that it\u0027s a very complicated topic that sometimes even grownups struggle with. Joshua thought about it for a moment and then issued his surprising response.Comments (417)Laura W. Murphy and Grover NorquistAttorney General Eric Holder\u0027s speech to the American Bar Association last Monday announcing critical reforms to the way the Department of Justice prosecutes and addresses drug crimes was historic and long overdue.CommentsDavid CoatesWorrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsIt is time, surely, for those of us who want to see important things done in Washington D.C. and in state capitals like Raleigh, North Carolina -- who want Washington and Raleigh to succeed -- to unite together to minimize the impact in both cities of those who want government to fail.Comments (34)Rachel LavineNYS Democratic Committeewoman, Downtown ManhattanWhat\u0027s with all this talk of vaginas and Christine Quinn running for mayor anyway? What is it about the prospect of a vagina possibly sitting in the seat of power that has so many people -- even people with vaginas themselves -- all worked up?Comments (15)Jordan SchultzThe Huffington Post\u0027s sports columnist, The Schultz ReportMike Shanahan has cited the obvious reason for keeping Robert Griffin off the field: that he does not want to risk further injury to his budding superstar, who is still just 23 years old. But it\u0027s a risk has taken before.CommentsAlison SpiegelBlog Editor, HuffPost Taste and HuffPost TravelThe sheer variety of food in New York makes this city what it is. It\u0027s noticeable, then, when a certain cuisine is missing. As of yet, Hawaiian food hasn\u0027t hit big in New York City. But is it the city\u0027s next big cuisine?CommentsDan KennedyAssistant professor, School of Journalism, Northeastern University; author, \u0027The Wired City\u0027In fact, there is nothing to stop the U.S. government from censoring the media with regard to revelations such as those contained in the Snowden files -- nothing, that is, except longstanding tradition.Comments (23)Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027In this anti-government, laissez-faire nation, the military gets a safe conduct pass to do something that no other branch of government is ideologically allowed to do -- commit the sin of economic planning.Comments (290)Stefanie WilliamsWriter and bloggerWe all fear this label. And the ironic part is, most of us do the slutty slut stuff. We take pics. We sext. We sleep with our boyfriends. Husbands. We get naked. We have vaginas. We use them. Some of us, sometimes, even enjoy using them.Comments (350)Bob KingPresident, United Auto WorkersWith joblessness still far too high, the income gap between rich and everyone else widening, racism and discrimination still festering and cities such as Detroit in the throes of bankruptcy, the words still call us to fight harder to achieve the unfinished agenda of civil rights and labor.Comments (23)Mike JulianelleBlogger, DadandBuried.comIt\u0027s uncanny how many aspects of the parenting experience remind me of prison -- complete with a sadistic little warden who harbors a Napoleon complex.Comments (1,218)Ayaan Hirsi AliFounder, AHA FoundationIn Cairo, Egyptian history appears to have completed a bloody full circle. First the crowds filled Tahrir Square to demand the end of a military-backed dictatorship. Then, just two years later, the crowds filled Tahrir Square again to demand the restoration of a military-backed dictatorship.Comments (278)Adam GrantWharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027We all know people who are go-getters. They’re the power brokers and business tycoons who are ambitious and enterprising in their pursuit of success. But there’s another path to success, one that focuses less on getting and more on giving.Comments (96)Michael Rose, 2013.20.08Carl Gibson, 2013.20.08Victoria A.
