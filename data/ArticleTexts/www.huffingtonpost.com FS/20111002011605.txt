{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week saw the rise of late-in-the-game Christie for President hoopla, and the dramatic, defeat-snatched-from-the-jaws-of-victory final fall of the Boston Red Sox. It also brought the start of Michael Jackson\u0027s doctor\u0027s trial (thrilling HLN\u0027s anchors, though Nancy Grace\u0027s wardrobe malfunction was caused by an energetic quickstep, not titillating testimony) and the end of Andy Rooney\u0027s run as America\u0027s favorite curmudgeon. Meeting a more final end was senior al Qaeda leader Anwar al-Awlaki, whose killing prompted Leon Panetta to offer this classic shot of wry: \"This has been a bad year for terrorists.\" Meanwhile, the Occupy Wall Street protests intensified, a welcome reminder that, for angry Americans, the Tea Party is not the only option -- and that the energy for real change will definitely come from outside Washington. Keep your eye on Zuccotti Square.Read Post | CommentsAlec Baldwin, 9/26/11ActorWe don\u0027t need the death penalty. Life in prison without parole is the worst possible sentence.

This time the office has to seek someone serious, and whoever that person is, has to come out of the closet soon.Read Post | Comments (168)Arianna Huffington, 9/26/11In the absence of jobs and a strong economy, voters at least want someone who speaks boldly about his plans to turn things around. It\u0027s not about the left or the right or the center, nor being smart or being reasonable. It\u0027s less about the brain and more about the lizard brain.Read Post | Comments (555)Van Jones, 9/30/11President of RebuildtheDream.com and author of NY Times bestseller, \"The Green-Collar Economy\"Wall Street has long been the home of the biggest threat to American Democracy.

El-Erian, 10/1/11CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOShould investors buy good companies trading at historically attractive prices?

In some ways, I think they\u0027re trying to tell me that thanks to the film, they now get it.Read Post | Comments (542)Rep. Keith Ellison, 9/27/11Co-Chair, Congressional Progressive CaucusInstead of supporting legislation to solve the jobs crisis, right-wing pundits and politicians are encouraging this gloom by claiming America is in \"decline.\" These critics are cynical and wrong.Read Post | Comments (140)Nelly Furtado, 9/29/11Mother, singer-songwriter, record producer and actressMy thoughts immediately went back to a concert I performed as part of a celebration thrown by someone described as an \"oil sheik\" in Italy in 2007. That night, I met a \"son of Gadhafi\" who had helped pay for the celebration.

They need our support.Read Post | Comments (255)Marian Wright Edelman, 9/30/11President, Children\u0027s Defense FundOur child poverty statistics are morally and economically indefensible.

Presidential elections are coming and the role of \"the evangelicals\" is predictably becoming a hot political story.
