{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoFaced with constitutional challenges to government actions, courts have two alternatives: they can uphold the law and allow it to be enforced or they can declare it invalid. When they uphold the law, they permit the majority to have their way; when they invalidate the law -- and exercise the power of judicial review -- they restrict the majority\u0027s freedom of action. The existence of judicial review matters only when the courts hold a law unconstitutional. A central question in evaluating this element of our constitutional structure is whether courts have exercised this authority wisely.It is, by now, a pretty well-worn topic that I don\u0027t think any of us particularly enjoy coming back to, but -- to bastardize Edmund Burke -- the only thing necessary for the triumph of stupid is for good men and women to do nothing.Jason LinkinsEditor, Eat the PressThe 2016 presidential elections will address a range of issues, many of them irrelevant. Unless a major war has broken out by that point, Americans will focus on their own wallets. As such, the wisest candidates will focus on gross inequality. Piketty\u0027s book should be a wake-up call for politicians. If inequality sells in the stores, it will sell at the polls as well.John FefferCo-director, Foreign Policy In FocusNo Child Left Behind, \"school choice,\" \"recovery school districts,\" and Common Core are what the United States has done to solve the education \"crisis.\" Mind you, the \"crisis\" is that the United States is not number one in education.Shayna A.

JoyceOnline job search expert, Job - Hunt.org writerThe major news of the announcement was the shock exclusion of Landon Donovan, the team\u0027s all-time leader in goals and assists. But the move was not the only surprise in the final round of roster cuts, which, considered together, paint a puzzling picture of the manager\u0027s decision-making.Bryan MaygersManaging Blog Editor, The Huffington PostThis system of destruction on a planetary scale, facilitated by most of the ruling and corporate elites on the planet, is becoming (to bring into play another category not usually used in connection with climate change) the ultimate \"crime against humanity\" and, in fact, against most living things. It is becoming a \"terracide.\"Tom EngelhardtEditor, TomDispatch.comIf you\u0027ve said any of these, don\u0027t feel bad (unless you\u0027ve stolen a handicap parking spot!).

His eyes danced when he told stories about dreaming up the multi-sectioned New York Times.Jill AbramsonExecutive Editor of the New York Times from 2011-2014Iggy Azalea is not a success story I wish to celebrate. To me, she isn\u0027t a success story at all: she is a novelty, a tiresome example of white female privilege and the delight white culture finds in white people appropriating any and everything.Olivia ColePoet, author, and activistAn Apple a day keeps the doctor away. An Apple every 20 seconds... well... that\u0027s too many f*cking Apples.Jeremy VandeheyTechnologist, entrepreneur, and writer. A Wisconsin farm boy at heart.Among the hundreds of thousands of twenty-somethings graduating from American colleges this month, an increasing number may consider forgoing the traditional first job search and opting instead for what has become something of the new American dream: Being your own boss.Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarLBJ, who himself had struggled to afford school to become a teacher, had a finely tuned sense of human potential, of justice, and of what was possible with hard work and a good education. In a speech at the University of Michigan, he asked America to see the powerful connection between educational opportunity and the nation\u0027s economic and moral health.Sec. Arne DuncanU.S. Secretary of EducationThe president should act now -- he should not wait for additional authority before doing the right thing, the moral thing. The president should transfer a significant number of detainees out of Guantanamo.Rev. Ron StiefExecutive Director, National Religious Campaign Against TortureScott Winship is one of a number of analysts who criticize Thomas Piketty\u0027s work for focusing largely on market incomes, thus leaving out the impact of taxes and transfer payments.
