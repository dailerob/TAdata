{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"The LA Times offers an eye-opening example of just how far our mission in Afghanistan has \"creeped,\" describing the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff telling an Afghan leader that the goals of the upcoming surge in Kandahar include \"providing jobs.\" Is that really why we are still fighting a war there nine years later, spending American blood and treasure? The Bush-era rationale for these overseas misadventures was always: We\u0027ll fight \u0027em over there, so we don\u0027t have to fight \u0027em over here. Today, it seems, we\u0027re fighting to create jobs for \u0027em over there, while we don\u0027t have enough jobs for our people over here. At a time when so many hardworking middle class families are reeling from the economic crisis that seems like the most perverted of priorities.Read Post | CommentsRobert Kuttner, 04.23.2010Co-Founder and Co-Editor of The American ProspectIf a bipartisan strategy is adopted on financial reform, both parties will declare victory and go home.

Better he apologize for the betrayals, rather than feign indifference. Why? Because the penitence may now spur change.Read Post | CommentsSen. Dianne Feinstein, 04.23.2010U.S. Senator from California.Time and time again, insurance corporations have demonstrated that their hunger for profit trumps any moral obligation to their customers.
