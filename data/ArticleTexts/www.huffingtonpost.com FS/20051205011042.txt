{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Reuters/Jim YoungFrom skinz.orgThis week’s hot topics included Bob Woodward, Duke Cunningham’s defense contractor ATM machine, that $10 million bat mitzvah, and President Bush’s new “Plan for Victory” -- which sounded an awful lot like his previous “Strategy for Victory”, with a twist: no more calling the insurgents “insurgents”! Don’t miss Marty Kaplan, Jesse Kornbluth, Paul Rieckhoff, Stephen Elliot, Stephen Schlesinger, and Bob Burnett on Bush’s speech; Trey Ellis, Patt Morrison, and Kaplan on Cunningham; and RJ Eskow and Anthony Lappe on the rockin’ bat mitzvah. Plus Danielle Crittenden’s latest Secret IM Session. And be sure and check out the best of the rest below in our Sunday Roundup.READ POST | comments (17)11.28.2005 Nora EphronI can’t believe that it falls to me to explain Bob Woodward. I can’t believe it for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that I don’t speak to Bob Woodward and Bob Woodward doesn’t speak to me.READ POST | comments (158)12.01.2005 Adam McKayAs we know, every lame, heavy-handed tactic the Republicans come up with the Democrats copy six months later and not as well. The Dems are kind of like Canadian TV that way.READ POST | comments (37)12.02.2005 Lyn Davis LearIf this report got the attention it deserves and broke through the static of our 500-channel universe, it could be the coup de grace of the Bush White House.READ POST | comments (133)11.29.2005 David ReesThank God the Iraq war has been such a BLOODY, MISMANAGED DISASTER, because we now know for sure that Saddamists and fundamentalists are capable of forming alliances!

Why, people like Junior Jenkins, people for whom cheapness is all, no matter what the cost. Every time Junior sees a Prius (or a working stiff), he sees only a price tag.READ POST | comments (82)11.30.2005 Robert ScheerSo, it is mission impossible that Bush has accomplished: A terminally inept U.S. occupation of Iraq now threatens to make the despot we overthrew look good by comparison.READ POST | comments (102)11.28.2005 Arianna HuffingtonHow did Woodward, supposedly the preeminent investigative reporter of our time, miss the biggest story of our time -- a story that was taking place right under his nose?READ POST | comments (138)12.01.2005 Robert F. Kennedy Jr.Yesterday, scientists revealed that global warming has disrupted and slowed the ocean conveyor belt that transports heat around the globe. So why was this vitally important story relegated to page 8 of the New York Times and page 20 of the Los Angeles Times?READ POST | comments (55)12.01.2005 Jane HamsherIf this is all the notoriously loose-lipped Luskin has, no wonder he\u0027s keeping the details of this particular story from the press.

What are these people thinking? Are they awake?
