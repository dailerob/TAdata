{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Author, \u0027Republic, Lost\u0027; Founder, RootstrikersI\u0027m a liberal. I believe in a woman\u0027s right to choose. I believe gays should be free to marry. I believe that society has an obligation to help the worst off. I believe public education should be free and fantastic. Business should not be allowed to pollute the environment.

John Conyers, 10/7/11Dean, Congressional Black CaucusToday, we mark the 10-year anniversary of the War in Afghanistan.

Pete Stark, 10/7/11Democratic Congressman from CaliforniaWe don\u0027t want to commemorate an 11th anniversary in Afghanistan.

Borosage, 10/7/11President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureNo one is confused about the message. Wall Street got bailed out; Main Street was abandoned. The top 1% rigs the rules and pockets the rewards.

Often these terms are delivered with a knowing wink, a certain warmth, almost in a family sort of way. Even so, they\u0027re still dicey in our community.Read Post | Comments (34)Denise Lumiere, 10/7/11Occupational therapist and creativity coachWhat if we really allowed ourselves to enjoy life, to laugh more -- and to see more inspirational movies?
