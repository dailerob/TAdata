In her announcement video, she indicated she wanted to be a champion for the average worker against the wealthy. While many policies will be needed to improve the situation of the poor and middle class, there are three simple ones that could make a big difference: a more competitive dollar, a Federal Reserve Board committed to full employment and a financial transactions tax to rein in Wall Street. If Clinton or any other presidential candidate wants to level the playing field, these policies would be a great place to start.When we launched our What\u0027s Working editorial initiative, we knew we wanted to tell solutions-oriented stories using all the tools at our disposal on a global scale. So in addition to our original reporting and the robust conversations we\u0027re starting on the blog, we\u0027ve now launched the What\u0027s Working Honor Roll, a daily morning roundup of the best solutions journalism around the world.I am a free speech absolutist. Perhaps the biggest tragedy in the West today is the fact that freedom of speech is no longer a right that we can take for granted. It is now a privilege available only to those with armed security.Author, Heretic: Why Islam Needs a Reformation NowToday McDonald\u0027s pledged to only buy food and raw materials from around the world that don\u0027t contribute to deforestation, a significant contributor to global warming. Given McDonald\u0027s reach, that\u0027s a potential game-changer.Senior Writer, Union of Concerned ScientistsIt may not have been your first thought when you looked at this picture of me at 39 weeks and two days pregnant, playing with my children in our backyard. But it\u0027s true.TV news reporter turned stay-at-home mama. Creator, SheJustGlows.comWe tend to treat these desperate migrant appearances en masse as sudden, unexpected events, almost like a tornado or tsunami, disconnected from the daily grind of national policy making and bad habits. They are not disconnected.Executive Director, MIT Center for International StudiesIt\u0027s for such reasons that I wish every policy maker trying to work with Iran could school himself in Farhadi\u0027s movies and see how every new step and revelation leaves one only deeper in an ever more bewildering maze. What is gambit and what sincere, where devil\u0027s advocacy ends and genuine unexpectedness begins, is hard for anyone (even those orchestrating all the moves) ever to know.Essayist, novelist, travel writerLynch\u0027s confirmation delay is nothing more than bells, whistles and red meat for the right-wing. It\u0027s yet another message that Blacks, women and quote \"others\" are expendable, and the least priority at best; they are in fact targeted by this crowd.President, National Action NetworkI am not exaggerating. The GOP voted to eliminate the estate tax. But the estate tax only applies to estates larger than $5.4 million for an individual and $10.9 million for couples. Eliminating the estate tax would benefit only 5,500 families in America (.02 percent of the population).Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersPoetry is not a frippery. It\u0027s a useful--even utilitarian--salve for what ails us. It is not the right salve for everyone, but it\u0027s right for some, and at times in its history, for very many. If it\u0027s right for you, you will know it. When you hear the right poem, you will feel its rightness.PoetConfession time. Yes, LGBT people are absolutely making a choice. They are choosing to be the most honest, authentic versions of themselves. The only relevant choice for straight Christians is whether we are willing to examine both our personal opinions and our theology accordingly. The choice is ours.Rogue Pastor and WriterYou\u0027ve undoubtedly heard that CEO Dan Price recently decided to cut his own salary in order to help finance a radical experiment in employee pay: everyone who works for Gravity Payments, based in Seattle, will now make $70,000/year.Author/Professor, Ohio StateWe are at a crossroads. The Republican budget seeks to destroy the legislative legacy of 1965 that made great differences in the lives of so many ordinary people. Democrats must defend our proud legacy and fight against the efforts of those who seek to devalue the worth of hardworking Americans.Representing South Carolina’s 6th Congressional DistrictTraditionally, fathers and daughters have struggled to regain the connection they shared when the girl was very young: the time of shoulder rides and tickle attacks. But fathers are learning to be role models for their daughters throughout adolescence and into adulthood.Author, research psychologist and gender scholar\"You keep wearing trash like this and you\u0027ll end up a whore, just like the women who represent Playboy.

Let\u0027s take a look at a few examples.Political strategistI\u0027m tired of feeling alone. I\u0027m tired of not being surrounded by activists fighting for survivors like myself. I smiled at No Red Tape\u0027s protest for the same reason I almost started crying with joy when I was accepted to Columbia: I know that, come August, I won\u0027t be alone anymore.Incoming freshman, Columbia University; Founder and president, Make It Safe ProjectThe reality is, we all have times of need. We all have moments when we have to reach out for help. At that time in my life I was thankful for the food bank. Their services helped feed my mind and body so that I could continue with my education.Author of The Deliberate MomRepealing the estate tax isn\u0027t just a boon for the 5,500 wealthiest Americans; it is a bust to federal taxpayers, who would be on the hook for its quarter-of-a-trillion-dollars cost. And it gets worse: Combined with other tax bills approved by House Republicans so far this year, our debt would grow by $584 billion to finance tax cuts for the wealthy.Sandy Levin is the Ranking Member of the House Ways and Means CommitteeFormer United States Navy Psychiatrist.

But few ask the opposite: What kind of children are we leaving behind for our planet?Youth Enterprise Development Consultant and U.S. State Department Fellow on the Community Solutions ProgramWhereas military force is selectively necessary to destroy irredeemably ruthless and bloodthirsty organizations such as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), to neutralize violent extremism in the long-term, no amount of military muscle will suffice.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUA woman president will only make a difference if that woman, while in office, stands for the rights and equal representation of women and girls, without apology, without dilution, and without her actions contradicting her words.Women\u0027s rights advocate, writer, women\u0027s leadershipIt\u0027s back for another season, and if you are HBO-less like me, you feel lost around the water cooler when your co-workers start talking about Game of Thrones.
