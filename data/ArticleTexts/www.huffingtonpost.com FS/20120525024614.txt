{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Financial crises are a lot like childbirth -- they both involve a lot of pain and end up costing you a lot of money. But, after a while, you forget about all the negatives and are ready to do it again. This propensity to forget, so useful when it comes to having babies, is incredibly destructive when it comes to our economy. So why do we do it? According to John Kenneth Galbraith, it\u0027s a combination of \"the extreme brevity of the financial memory\" and a general ignorance of history. As a result, boom and bust cycles are repeated endlessly -- and so is the response, in which reforms are proposed but, as the public\u0027s anger -- and memory -- weakens, so does the \"reform.\" By the time reform measures are passed, lobbying has weakened them enough to make another crisis inevitable.

But an American energy revolution that shifted meaningfully away from fossil fuels would require something more than episodic financial pain. It would require ongoing economic smarts.Read Post | Comments (27)Marlo Thomas, 05/24/12Award-winning actress, author, and activistHere are some of the women who left an indelible mark during their time in the White House.Read Post | Comments (36)Christy Turlington Burns, 05/24/12Founder, Every Mother Counts, Director/Producer, NO WOMAN, NO CRY, global maternal health advocate, mom, modelThe number of women who died from pregnancy and childbirth complications dropped to 287,000 in 2010.

The financial impacts of pension deficits are going to be felt at the state and local level for years, and will continue to influence the political landscape as politicians are forced to confront that which is manifestly broken.Read Post | CommentsAngie Harmon, 05/24/12ActressIt is for all of the wonderful men in my life that I am raising my voice about a disease that affects more than two million American men and remains the second-leading cause of cancer death for men in the U.S. We can make a difference with the progress of finding better treatments and ultimately, a cure.Read Post | Comments (39)Arianna Huffington, 05/24/12The moment I knew I needed more sleep was four years ago, when I learned the value of sleep -- the hard way.

For that same reason, Romney is the quintessence of an economic approach shown to be anti-growth and anti-jobs. The president needs to tell this to the American people.Read Post | Comments (490)Stephen Gyllenhaal, 05/24/12Stirring the pot...I made a comedy movie to go with this election cycle. But to be honest, I can\u0027t claim I was prescient about just how comedic the political scene would become. Or how tragic. And nothing fits better with tragedy than comedy.Read Post | CommentsBob Cesca, 05/23/12Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez Show, Media ProducerArguably the biggest lie coming from the Republicans and the Romney campaign is that President Obama is a tax and spend liberal who\u0027s directly and personally responsible for record deficits and a crushing national debt.Read Post | Comments (1,138)Adam Levin, 05/24/12Founder, Credit.com and former director NJ Division of Consumer AffairsThe system by which we fund higher education may be horribly broken, but that in no way means the people who are a product of it should be written off. Graduates should feel empowered to effect these changes. If they don\u0027t -- if they\u0027re all too cynical and feel there\u0027s no use in trying -- then we\u0027re in big trouble.Read Post | CommentsRep.

We stayed all night, and stumbled out only in time for breakfast.Read Post | CommentsJoseph A. Palermo, 05/24/12Associate Professor/Historian/AuthorIt\u0027s an uphill climb for Obama to even mildly criticize Mitt Romney for being a vulture capitalist given his lack of accomplishment in holding anyone on Wall Street accountable for the economic carnage they wreaked.Read Post | Comments (21)Mike Lux, 05/24/12Partner, Democracy PartnersHere\u0027s the deal about this election year: Democrats are going to have blow off these attitudes by their Wall Street gang if they are going to have a chance to win this election.Read Post | Comments (14)Tasha Gordon-Solmon, 05/24/12PlaywrightHere\u0027s the other thing: Miss Piggy is so much more charismatic than Emily. It was almost unfair they had to share screen time. There was a running gag of Piggy getting jealous of Em and Kermit. And despite Kermit\u0027s best efforts to compliment Emily, it was clear he\u0027s way out of her league.Read Post | CommentsAnnette Insdorf, 05/24/12Director of undergraduate film studies, Columbia University, and author of PHILIP KAUFMANIt\u0027s no surprise that Philip Kaufman -- perhaps the most European of American filmmakers -- was drawn to the passionate story of Ernest Hemingway and war correspondent Martha Gellhorn.Read Post | CommentsMichael Roth, 05/24/12President, Wesleyan UniversityBy no means is the three-year option for everyone.
