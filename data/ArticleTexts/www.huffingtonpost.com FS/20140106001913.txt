{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week, winter storm Hercules got 2014 off to a frigid start for the roughly 100 million people in its path. Things were equally chilly for the 1.3 million people whose unemployment benefits expired on December 28th -- a frosty \"gift\" from Congress, which was clearly unmoved by the fact that long-term unemployment is at its highest point since World War II. Congress should renew the emergency aid as soon as it reconvenes this week; if not, another 3.6 million Americans who\u0027ve been out of work longer than 26 weeks will shortly find themselves out in the no-more-benefits-cold -- and prey to the health consequences, damaged relationships and increased rates of suicide often associated with long-term unemployment. Maybe the New Year -- and the coming midterm elections -- will help melt the GOP\u0027s frostbitten heart.Comments (11)Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOI am a believer in the role of incentives in an economy, including how badly-aligned incentives can result in sub-optimal outcomes. But I find it hard to make the case here given the evidence on the extent and duration of long-term unemployment.CommentsGeoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoThe central question posed by the bulk telephony meta-data program is this: Is the government\u0027s collection of an individual\u0027s telephone call records from the individual\u0027s telephone service provider a \"search\" of that individual within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment?Comments (97)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundHis commitment as a leader to South Africa\u0027s children was the extension of a principle that has governed leaders of traditional communities for generations: If the children are well, then all of us are well.CommentsJim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027This past year taught me so much about the gospel and caused me to go deeper into my faith. As this new year begins, here are five spiritual resolutions I learned from last year.Comments (14)TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"To kick off the New Year, TEDWeekends is proud to present a compilation of six insanely popular TED Talks from our 2013 programming. These talks inspired a tremendous amount of engagement from our community last year, and each one provides valuable insight that will help you get the most out of life in 2014.Comments (21)Lincoln Mitchelllincolnmitchell.comIncome inequality is different from poverty, an issue that is often discussed by politicians. These discussions, until this year, tended to frame poverty as an isolated issue growing out of individual or collective failings. Income inequality is different because it suggests that the problem is structural and deeply embedded in our larger economic system.Comments (187)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorMichael Moore\u0027s oped in today\u0027s NYT about both the shortcomings and attributes of the Affordable Care Act, on the day its coverage officially begins to kick in, gets the politics wrong but he gets the policy right in important ways.Comments (256)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarWhat happens when a generation said to be far less conspicuous in its consumption confronts human nature? The personal growth and fulfillment at the top Maslow\u0027s Hierarchy of Needs occupies the floor just above esteem -- defined by status, achievement and reputation.Comments (30)Paul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostToday we can ask ourselves the ultimate question: To what will we devote our life in this very short span of time that we have in this world? What will captivate us, be the focus of our life\u0027s energy, be what we care most about in the world. In short -- what will we worship?Comments (126)Rachel Macy StaffordCertified special education teacher and authorMy child would not have learned this empathetic response if I had remained a yeller. Because yelling shuts down the communication; it severs the bond; it causes people to separate -- instead of come closer.Comments (28)Scott Barry Kaufman, Ph.D.Co-founder, The Creativity Post; Author, \u0027Ungifted: Intelligence Redefined\u0027Today millions of Americans will pull out their lists of New Year\u0027s resolutions, full of intentions to control their many temptations, from one-night stands to junk food to alcohol to smoking. What are the costs of all that self-control?Comments (22)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorYou can imagine my surprise when I received a request from a certain notorious former President of the United States asking for my financial support in his public policy center\u0027s efforts to address the \"challenges facing our world.\"Comments (285)Christine PelosiChair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusAs 2014 dawns, women on the run in political office and public service have multitasking ahead. How well we juggle doing it all -- home life, work life, personal space and public engagement -- may well determine the fate of our families and our nation.CommentsSen. Bernie SandersIndependent U.S. Senator from VermontAs we survey our country at the end of 2013, I don\u0027t have to tell you about the crises we face. Many of you are experiencing them every day.Comments (136)Linda McMahonCo-founder and former CEO, WWE; 2012 Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in ConnecticutDemocrats and Republicans didn\u0027t find a lot to agree on in 2013, but the first and most important action they should agree on in 2014 is to delay -- perhaps indefinitely -- the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act.Comments (89)David RockDirector, NeuroLeadership InstituteIn 2013, we continued to push the boundaries of what we know about ourselves; going boldly into questions no researcher has gone before. Like, what should we do when we need a little lift -- take a run, have a coffee, or grab a beer?CommentsRichard KirschSenior Fellow, Roosevelt Institute; author of \u0027Fighting for Our Health\u0027Is the political system in the United States capable of responding to the escalating crisis of stagnant wages, shrinking benefits, dissolving economic opportunity, and disappearing hopes of living anything that resembles the American Dream? It is a question I ask myself every day.CommentsClaire FallonManaging Blog Editor, The Huffington PostMy real resolution, however, involves a different kind of muscle -- one that\u0027s been atrophying in recent years. Yes, it\u0027s my brain, which needs to be strengthened with a healthy reading regimen.Comments (23)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Last week former New York Times editor Bill Keller had a column that distinguished the \"left-left\" and the center-left. However, what\u0027s more important than the labeling is the main line of distinction Keller tries to draw.Comments (90)Terry O\u0027NeillPresident, National Organization for WomenI don\u0027t doubt that the individuals who control the Little Sisters of the Poor are entitled to religious freedom. I wish they could recognize that their First Amendment right to practice their own religion doesn\u0027t trump women\u0027s basic rights.Comments (260)Mark RadcliffeWriter and singer/songwriterDear Ladies Who Are On The Fence About Whether Or Not to Dump The Guy Who\u0027s Taking You For Granted: Here\u0027s what you should be hearing from the guy who\u0027s worthy of your time.Comments (67)Joe PeyronninHofstra Journalism ProfessorMuch of the country kicked off the New Year with heavy snowstorms followed by a blast of frigid cold temperatures. But for 1.3 million Americans, whose unemployment checks have been cut off, this may be the coldest winter of all.Comments (39)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistOne of the many reasons I love living in New York is that we get a front row seat to the innumerable thrills that take place here. But my favorite New York tradition is the annual New Year\u0027s Eve ball-drop on Times Square. All around the globe, people are counting down in thousands of different languages as we bid goodbye to the departing year.CommentsAdam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; co-founder of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911Many of us spend more time watching TV shows we don\u0027t even like than we would need to fix our finances. Just follow these seven easy tips and not only will you be on the road to financial stability, you\u0027ll also realize how easy it is to stay on course.CommentsDonna Rockwell, PsyDLicensed clinical psychologist, specialist in celebrity mental health, leading mindfulness meditation teacher, and activist in contemporary humanistic psychologyResolutions usually made in desperation become another excuse for guilt and self-denigration, another opportunity to feel like a failure. How can resolutions be a point of positive self-growth, instead, where we make them, and keep them, and benefit from their healing and restorative powers?Comments (16)Ben IrwinAuthor, bloggerWhile it\u0027s popular to think people are poor because they\u0027re lazy, the poor actually work longer and harder than the rest of us.Comments (217)Jordan K. TurgeonLifestyle Blog Editor, The Huffington PostMy compulsive checking had become a burden instead of a fun way to keep in touch. I wanted to live a better, more present life, and in order to do that I had to stop bombarding myself with information on how everyone else was living theirs.Comments (24)Micah J. MurrayBlogger at RedemptionPictures.comIt\u0027s a special sort of condescending love we\u0027ve reserved for the gay community. We\u0027ll agree to love them, accept them, welcome them -- but we reserve the right to see them as different. We reserve the right to say \"them\" instead of \"us.\" So I\u0027m done.Comments (728)Jennifer BallMom, writer, teacher, lover of dirty martinis and yoga pantsHere are the things you need to stop saying if you are over the age of 30. Or if you have a mortgage, or a job that comes with benefits. Or if you have teens. Especially, if you have teens.Comments (778)Robert NaimanPolicy Director, Just Foreign PolicyNow we know that it\u0027s actually not so hard to get Washington to do the right thing if the choices are framed correctly. Having learned this lesson, let us apply it to the question of future wars, and to the proposed Iran war in particular.Comments (91)Student Reporter, 2014. 5.01Mohamed A.
