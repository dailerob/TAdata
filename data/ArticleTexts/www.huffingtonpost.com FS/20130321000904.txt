{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOAs they scramble to sort out the mess in Cyprus, European officials would be well advised to constantly remind themselves of a reality that I suspect extends across the continent: Despite all the happy talk about smaller deficits and lower sovereign credit spreads, citizens are yet to feel any notable improvement in their actual standard of living and in their prospects. Day in and day out, this situation undermines the population\u0027s confidence in the timely responsiveness of their elected representatives, the political system and traditional political parties. The longer this persists, the harder it will be to pivot to the type of policy reforms needed to decisively avoid more years of economic difficulties.Comments (37)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarAs we look at the rise of females in charge, there\u0027s been speculation of a future of kinder, gentler work environments. Maybe that will happen, maybe it won\u0027t. But guaranteed, the onus isn\u0027t on the queen bee alone. It\u0027s on her worker bees as well.Comments (85)Brendan Hannigan, 03.20.2013General Manager, IBM Security SystemsThe ability to access this data from anywhere in the world and finding meaningful ways to combine it with other sources of data is at the core of the vision for a smarter, more connected and intelligent planet. Yet, the flipside is that these new sources of data and information are perfect targets for fraud and crime.Read Post | CommentsDylan RatiganNew York Times Best-Selling author and formerly the host of MSNBC\u0027s The Dylan Ratigan ShowIf you are reading this, you likely know I left a highly-successful, self-titled show at MSNBC last June in search of meaning and purpose in my work and life. I had lost both after 18 years in Manhattan, and It was a three-tour Iraq combat Marine and his war-protestor wife who pointed me in a new direction.Comments (55)Hussein Ibish, Ph.D. and Pratik ChouguleTen years later, was the Iraq War worth it? Did the U.S. achieve its goals? Is Iraq a more democratic country? Are the Iraqi people better off than they were under Saddam Hussein? Was it worth the cost? And most important, was it worth the American and Iraqi lives lost? You decide.Comments (210)Norman LearFounder, People for the American WayWe veterans of WWII and everyone who remembers Eisenhower, this gentle man with the giant fist, the president who kept us out of conflict after conflict, often against the advice of those around him, have an investment in how he is remembered.CommentsCandida MossAuthor, \u0027The Myth of Persecution: How Early Christians Invented a Story of Martyrdom\u0027 and Professor of New Testament and Early Christianity and the University of Notre DameIf persecution language is not reserved for situations of actual persecution, then unspeakable violence becomes indescribable. Disagreement becomes martyrdom and martyrdom becomes disagreement.Comments (689)Peter TurnleyPeterturnley.comCommentsMichael HoganExecutive Arts and Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post Media GroupFor every instance of cultural tone-deafness, Vacation gave us a dozen immortal family-road-trip one-liners. Lines like: \"Nothing worth doing is easy, Ellen, you know that,\" \"Watch those freeways!,\" \"You\u0027re the gourmet chef around here, Eddie,\" \"Good talk, Russ\" and the poolside classic, \"This is crazy, this is crazy, this is crazy!\"CommentsJosh SilverDirector, Represent.UsElections have become auctions, and nearly every issue is paralyzed by the overwhelming influence of money. But you knew that. The real challenge is how to fix what has become one of our nation\u0027s most pressing political challenges.Comments (438)Kimberly BrooksArtist www.kimberlybrooks.comI\u0027m thrilled today to unveil and launch the ImageBlog, a communal platform for artists from all over the world to share and engage. Featured artists submit images of their work -- in whole, in detail, or in progress -- with a caption of any length, but unlike a blog, the image is paramount.Comments (15)Dan TreadwayAssociate blog editor, The Huffington PostUse your ignorance to your advantage, because in the majority of March Madness pools I\u0027ve been involved in, the person who ultimately wins hasn\u0027t watched one dribble of a basketball all season prior to filling out their bracket.CommentsRobert CreamerPolitical Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersWithout the social policy \"wedge issues\" that the GOP has used for decades to distract the attention of working class voters from the Republican Party establishment\u0027s core economic interests, the GOP risks being defined forever by that iconic \"47 percent\" moment -- and many like it to come.Comments (317)Dr. Patricia FitzgeraldWellness Editor, The Huffington Post; Doctor of acupuncture and Oriental medicine; Nutritionist; AuthorFor many dog guardians, our relationships with our dogs can be a taste of heaven. Except when the cuties start having surprising behavior that isn\u0027t so cute. Dogs are known to be stress reducers; however, for many people, their dog\u0027s behavior can be a huge source of stress.CommentsRonnie MusgroveFormer governor of MississippiThe issue of equal rights for LGBT individuals has vexed politicians for decades. I have my own cloudy history with the issue, which I believed at the time was a principled position based on my faith. But I no longer believe it was right.CommentsErel MargalitKnesset member (Labor); Founder, Jerusalem Venture Partners (JVP)Israel is often dubbed the \"Start-up Nation\" due to our technological prowess, but looking back at the status of the Israeli-Palestinian track over the past twenty years, as far as our diplomatic achievements are concerned, we are not a \"Start-up Nation,\" we are a \"Stagnant Nation.\"CommentsDaniel J. SchultzFoodCorps service member - Des Moines, IowaAs I read Michael Moss\u0027s new book, Salt Sugar Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us, I saw myself in it. I was one of the kids these companies targeted and successfully sold their products to.CommentsBarry LandoAuthor, \u0027Web of Deceit\u0027How could any U.S. administration stand by as an Arab dictator gassed his own people? The fact is they did: President Reagan not only turned his back on such ruthless attacks, though they were substantiated by grisly video evidence, but continued to aid the tyrant who was ordering the savagery.Comments (40)Steven KolbCEO, Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA)Counterfeiting is a multi-billion dollar global industry and shoppers from almost all socioeconomic backgrounds have admitted to buying a counterfeit product. As someone who works closely with both established and up-and-coming designers, these figures are deeply troubling.CommentsPam OmidyarFounder and board chair, Humanity UnitedMore than 65 years after the Holocaust, almost 20 years after Rwanda\u0027s horrific genocide, 10 years after the atrocities in Darfur and while Syrians and the people of the Nuba Mountains still suffer, it\u0027s unacceptable that we continue to accept these situations as status quo.CommentsLisa BelkinSenior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, The Huffington PostUntil we find that new path, women (and men) who can afford to step off the existing path, will continue to do so. And we will have the cover story equivalent of \"Groundhog Day\" -- as each new cohort finds itself conflicted for the first time.Comments (426)Matthew DowdPolitical strategistThe Republican brand and many of its candidates are seen as intolerant throwbacks to a time gone by and not compassionate to where people are in their lives.Comments (270)Imogen Lloyd WebberAuthor and BroadcasterPerhaps I am just getting old. Maybe it\u0027s the new normal to arrive twenty minutes late, to arrange a meeting so you can spend its duration broadcasting to the world where your physical but not mental presence is and to never snail mail.Comments (38)Courtney BaxterChief Wrangler at The OpEd ProjectFor some, the threat of violence is too real, and the simple act of holding hands or kissing on a street corner would be unwise and unsafe. But for the rest of us, we have the capability to shift the tides by making ourselves visible.CommentsTom MeyersFounder, editor, EuroCheapo.comAmericans love Eurail passes and for a good reason: They\u0027re convenient and exciting to hold onto before your trip. They are not necessarily, however, a great deal.Comments (42)Amitai EtzioniProfessor of international relations, George Washington UniversityIf you understand where President Obama is headed in his second term, pray send me an email. I like him, wish him God-speed, and might well support where he is going -- if I could just figure out where that is.Comments (53)Pat GallagherFreelance WriterMultiple marriages have made headlines in the Hollywood community since the golden age of film, when movie stars began to see their names in lights and their private lives scrutinized by the press.Comments (31)John GerzemaAuthor, \"The Athena Doctrine: How Women (And The Men Who Think Like Them) Will Rule The Future\"My collaborator and co-author Michael D\u0027Antonio and I travelled the world and conducted personal interviews with global political and business leaders as well as NGOs and start-ups to find out how these traits can be applied in real world situations.CommentsSen. Ben CardinDemocratic U.S. Senator for MarylandWe just passed the second anniversary of the Syrian uprising that began in March 2011 and the situation inside Syria and in the region is reaching catastrophic proportions.Comments (35)Jon WortmannMental Coach, AuthorYou\u0027ve heard for years that we only use a percentage of our brains. Not at all true. What\u0027s true is that we don\u0027t know how to consciously use our brains to take advantage of our best experiences and use them to make every 24-hour period happier and healthier.CommentsBritChick ParisBritish girl living the Parisian life with all its highs and lowsMy instinct tells me that if I want a baby it will come naturally or if it doesn\u0027t maybe it is not meant to be. Others have a different vibe about the whole thing and are comfortable with fertility treatment, IVF or other procedures. But for me and for many of my friends the cost was getting too high. It made me sick, frustrated, anxious and most of all I lost me.Comments (20)Angelina ChapinBlogs Editor, Huffington Post CanadaInstead of being revered as an upcoming star in women\u0027s figure skating, for the past few days Kaetlyn Osmond has been known as the girl whose crotch shot was printed in a national newspaper. And that\u0027s the real tragedy of this story.Comments (18)Sue Kerr, 2013.20.03Seth Santoro, 2013.20.03Chris Weigant, 2013.20.03George Bradt, 2013.20.03Norman Lear, 2013.20.03Gerry Hudson, 2013.20.03James Golsan, 2013.20.03Rob Taub, 2013.20.03Bruce Weinstein, 2013.20.03Grown And Flown, 2013.20.03Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"I\u0027M WATCHING YOU",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
