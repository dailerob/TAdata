{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonTo paraphrase Einstein, you can\u0027t solve a problem using the same type of thinking that created it. When you consider this bit of wisdom alongside the scale of the problems we\u0027re facing around the world, it\u0027s clear that our current model of leadership sorely needs a refresh. Everywhere we look, we see leaders with high IQs making terrible decisions -- government shutdown, anyone? -- burned out and unable to tap into their own wisdom. That\u0027s why I\u0027m here in Johannesburg to join a conversation among a group of 1,300 young leaders from all over the world who are every day solving problems in their communities. Being with them restores my faith in leadership. Together, we\u0027ll be highlighting examples from around the world of what is working when it comes to young people creating their own employment opportunities and extending opportunities to others.Comments (18)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027It is a minority of our elected officials who are demonstrating their anti-government ideology. But that extreme minority has captured their party and the political process, and has driven the nation into dangerous crisis based upon fear.Comments (178)Kirk DouglasActorWhen you get to be 96 years of age the road ahead is short, so you look back at the road you have traveled for almost 100 years. The first thing you come up against is technology.Comments (47)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureForty million dollars an hour. A third of a billion every day. $1.6 billion every week. That\u0027s a conservative estimate of the money Republicans are wasting by keeping the federal government closed down.Comments (327)Sally SteenlandDirector, the Faith and Progressive Policy Initiative, Center for American ProgressModern Republicans\u0027 callousness and willingness to overburden the poor evokes another act of state villainy -- one that is especially pertinent because Republican leaders so often invoke the Bible.Comments (940)Norman LearFounder, People for the American WayI\u0027m a WWII veteran myself. I like that the men and women who served alongside me can visit the monument in their honor. But maybe a better tribute from our Tea Party politicians would be to step away from the cameras and end this shutdown that they themselves created.Comments (18)Ann BrenoffSenior Writer, The Huffington Post\u0027It takes all kinds.\u0027 That\u0027s what my mother used to say with a shrug every time she encountered someone who behaved in a way she found offensive. I\u0027m a bit less tolerant than Mom was. For the occasions when forgiveness eludes me, I have created a few new Circles of Hell that Dante may have missed. Please add your own contributions in the comments below; here\u0027s my list.Comments (211)Bernard StarrPsychologist; Journalist; College ProfessorListen to sermons throughout religious America and you are likely to hear variations on the lofty principle featured in both the Old and New Testaments: \"Love your neighbor as yourself.\" But as we well know talk can be cheap.Comments (122)Valerie AlexanderAuthor, \u0027Happiness as a Second Language\u0027We all need to stop focusing so much on capturing the moment and just enjoy it instead. Be present. Live in it.Comments (43)Adam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; founder of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911If you think the most common cyber scam still involves deposed Nigerian royalty eliciting your help to extract fortunes from African banks, your time machine has stalled. Cyber ninjas have become far more creative, sophisticated and inscrutable.Comments (60)Thomas KentDeputy managing editor and standards editor, Associated PressThe debate over \"who\u0027s a journalist\" is getting more urgent. Fortunately, the outlines of a definition are becoming clearer. Might some basic ethical tests help in further drawing the lines?Comments (12)Zoe LintzerisAssociate blog editor, The Huffington PostYou name it, and I ate it. And I would like to believe by the grace of my genes and unchanging teen jeans\u0027 size, I still managed to resemble a knobby-kneed colt. Until I realized something was wrong. You see, whoever came up with that saying \"you are what you eat\" was right.CommentsWoody Roseland22-year-old motivational speaker, TED Talker, stand-up comedianI\u0027m not sure if my next scans will be clear, or if after my next scans I\u0027ll have to return to my all too familiar cancer routine. But for now, I\u0027m here. Which is a lot more than many people I\u0027ve met along the way can say.CommentsJohn KinnearAuthor of AskYourDadBlog.comOur kids are going to love who they love, and any amount of pushing I do is going to send my daughter straight into Michael\u0027s stubby little toddler arms. I suppose their love is inevitable. So here you go MICHAEL FROM DAYCARE. This is for you. Take good care of her.Comments (22)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThe more President Obama and Harry Reid assert their simple strategy -- we won\u0027t negotiate under these conditions; pass a clean budget patch and debt ceiling bill and then we\u0027ll talk -- the wilder the House Republicans are getting.Comments (74)The One Young World SummitBringing together young people from all over the world to \"help them make lasting connections to create positive change\"Education saved us. With funding from a Canadian government training program, my mother enrolled in a computer programming class. She had been raising my sister and me with money earned from odd jobs, but knew it wouldn\u0027t be enough.CommentsLaverne H. BardyAuthor, Syndicated Humor Columnist, bloggerShould the day come when I am forced to stop traffic as I cross the road with my walker, please do not feel sorry for me. My bones will be tired, my skin will no longer be taut and my body may be contorted, but my heart will be smiling broadly, for I will be deeply ensconced in the memories of my astounding life; a life void of regrets for what I should have done. I will have done it all.Comments (221)Theresa D\u0027AngeloProjects Director, The Huffington PostI was going to write a blog post along the lines of \"20 Ways I Freaked Out On My Babies\u0027 First Day At Daycare,\" but I was too busy freaking out to write anything down. It was actually nothing compared to the freaking out I did on Day 3 of daycare anyway -- and this time, it was all condensed into a span of about 114 seconds.Comments (394)Lord Weidenfeld of ChelseaFounder and chairman of Weidenfeld \u0026 NicolsonIt is the task of a bold and constructive German foreign policy to play a leading role in the EU and in that Zwischeneuropa, the \"Europe in-between\", from the Baltic to the Black Sea; but also to influence the peace efforts in what has become the \"Wild East\" - the Orient. Maybe it is going too far to speak of a German pacifistic Sleeping Beauty slumber.CommentsKathleen ReardonProfessor, USC Marshall School; Author, \u0027The Secret Handshake\u0027 and \u0027Shadow Campus\u0027The Republicans have chosen not to be good, not to be fair, not to be rational in the common sense of these words. The needs of the \"folks\" pale by comparison to the distributive demands of the moment.Comments (930)Laura Kate DaleVideo game enthusiastIn the last 72 hours I\u0027ve received more death threats, rape threats, abuse and hatred than I can count. I\u0027m transgender, and on Sunday, Sept. 29, I found my name spreading across the gaming community for identifying the man who\u0027d misgendered me.Comments (187)RoadtrippersDiscover Your AmericaDon\u0027t let the government shutdown get you down. Just do what a real adventurer would do: adapt! There\u0027s countless waterfalls, beaches, forests and more just waiting to be discovered in the country\u0027s state and county parks.CommentsChris WeigantPolitical writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comIf there was some underlying \"cut deficits\" strategy to the Republican shutdown, then why would the House have passed a budget bill on the brink of the shutdown which increased the debt by $29 billion?Comments (107)David VineAssistant Professor of Anthropology, American UniversityThe Pentagon has spent the last two decades plowing hundreds of millions of tax dollars into military bases in Italy, turning the country into an increasingly important center for U.S. military power.Comments (14)Alon Ben-MeirSenior Fellow, NYU\u0027s Center for Global AffairsThe right of return will continue to be a major obstacle in peace negotiations unless Israel and the Palestinian leadership accept the changing realities which in fact lend themselves to find a solution.Comments (17)Jen M.L.Author, Spending the Holidays with People I Want to Punch in the Throat and I Just Want to Pee AloneThey don\u0027t know what irony means, so it\u0027s adorable when they tell you that Green Eggs and Ham is one of their favorite books even though it\u0027s a story about a guy who refuses to try anything new and strange because he\u0027s afraid he\u0027ll hate it and then finally he relents and realizes it\u0027s amazing.Comments (19)Barbara BrunoNFL Analyst and Commentator, Independent Film Producer, Non-Profit Grant WriterHigh-flyers like Green Bay and Denver are both up against good defenses as they face Detroit and Dallas. Superstar Seattle is on the road against underrated Indy.Comments (16)Meghan RalstonHarm Reduction Manager, Drug Policy AllianceOperating as an above-ground source for a variety of drugs, ranging from marijuana to heroin and virtually everything in between, Silk Road created a safe environment, free of weapons and violence during the transaction, where people could acquire drugs.CommentsFrances BeineckePresident, Natural Resources Defense CouncilRepublicans have put America\u0027s health and environment in jeopardy with their shutdown tactics. The question is: will they learn from their error or do it all again in two weeks when the debt ceiling must be lifted?Comments (89)Saude CriancaSaúde Criança\u0027s holistic approach to healthcare is an investment that provides positive returns to society.CommentsJohn KaoChair, Institute for Large Scale InnovationWhen I imagine national security strategists sitting around trying to figure out what lies around the next corner, I hope they will spend at least part of their time reading Tom Clancy and the Tom Clancys to come.Comments (95)Esther Perel, 2013. 4.10Lori Bell, 2013. 4.10Laurie Gerber, 2013. 4.10Dr. Corey Allan, 2013. 4.10Jeffrey Rubin, 2013. 3.10Dr. Reese Halter, 2013. 3.10Steven Suskin, 2013. 3.10Steve DiFillippo, 2013. 3.10Beverly Bell, 2013. 3.10Elizabeth Baudouin, 2013. 3.10Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"DEBT DANCE BOEHNER BLINKS REPORTS: Speaker Says He Won\u0027t Let U.S. Default...
