{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Filmmaker, Brave New FoundationTo the opposition of the Iran deal, President Obama recently stated, \"Let\u0027s not mince words: The choice we face is ultimately between diplomacy and some form of war -- maybe not tomorrow, maybe not three months from now, but soon.\" And now, as the president is trying to broker the historic deal, Sen. Charles Schumer -- who also voted for the Iraq war -- is sabotaging the Iran deal, claiming the United States should call for a \"better deal.\" Schumer was wrong about Iraq and is wrong about the Iran deal.

Opposing this deal and offering no alternative is putting us on the path to war, which we all know will come at a tremendous cost.A career in the entertainment industry didn\u0027t make me an expert on the legal system, but being falsely accused of teen molestation came close.

Only a candidate who is a socially tolerant, fiscally responsible and principled leader can reinvigorate the Republican brand.U.S. Senator from Kentucky, candidate for 2016 Republican presidential nominationWe support the Sanders moment because of the rare opportunity his campaign represents to not just speak truth to power, but to join movements together to change our country.Executive director, National Nurses United (AFL-CIO) and California Nurses AssociationThe military commissions have once again cancelled two weeks\u0027 worth of hearings scheduled in the case of the five alleged plotters of the September 11 attacks. Although the attacks themselves took place nearly 14 years ago, the five men accused of masterminding the deadliest terror attack to ever take place on U.S. soil are still nowhere near trial.Senior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstPlanned Parenthood has become the battered scapegoat, bullied by a Senate that historically and profoundly excludes women. Lost in the politicking over this issue is the bravery and courage of women who agreed to be donors.

You don\u0027t need to be told about racism or white privilege. You might think this whole movement creates more trouble than it solves. Why, you may ask, do we insist upon bringing it up time and again? Here\u0027s why.independent bookseller, writer and occasional activistWe cannot and will not stand by any longer as our sisters and siblings are murdered in the streets, ignored by the nation and misgendered by the media.Genderqueer Transfeminine Feminist, Chapman University Class of 2015In meetings, I kept hearing revelatory things -- about how resentments were like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die, how rejection was God\u0027s protection and more that may sound clichéd now as I write but which literally changed my life. Basically, I fell in love with AA before I remembered that I hated it.AuthorIf you use Facebook, you\u0027re making easy work for identity thieves. The same goes for the whole cosmos of social media whether you favor Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, Pinterest, YouTube, LinkedIn, or prefer to Tumblr your thoughts, preferences and predilections to anyone who cares to know what they are.Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and IDT911In just the past 24 hours, two courts reaffirmed that religious beliefs can\u0027t justify discrimination against lesbians and gay men.Director of the ACLU Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender \u0026 AIDS ProjectIt does not help much, for those few individuals who are attracted to an ISIS type of extremism, to completely and summarily dismiss or condemn ISIS. In fact, the more that ISIS is condemned the more appealing it can be for some who are precisely seeking a movement or cause that will stick it to the status quo.Muslim Life Coordinator and Chaplain, Princeton UniversityI was honored to know my mom and I\u0027m grateful she let me share in her journey. It was a bittersweet gift filled with life lessons. I was lying on the sofa beside her at her home when she took her final breaths, and though it was of course a time of grief, she made sure we were ready.Dr. Chester Goad is an author and speaker on learning, leadership, and life. Connect with him at chestergoad.com.If you\u0027re a member of any group that\u0027s been shut out, pushed aside, forgotten or made fun of, you\u0027ll never change anything by following the rules. The rules are what marginalized you in the first place. You\u0027ve got to break a few of them if you want to make history.Writer, photographer, explainer of the strange and wonderfulWhere Mr. Carter comes from and lives, and his race, make little difference when one considers that this Southern white man has always stood up and fought for the rights and dignity of \"the least of these. He has been steadfast and immovable, as the Bible describes we should be.Writer, author, musician, pastor, preacher and social justice advocate.It pains me to say it out loud, but I think malls are dying -- and not the quick and easy way, or in their sleep. But slow, painful, gasping for their last breath kind of deaths.Writer and actorAs the price of oil continues on its downward course, the cancellation or postponement of such mega-projects has been sending powerful shock waves through the energy industry, and also ancillary industries, communities, and countries that depend on oil extraction for the bulk of their revenues.Author and Professor of Peace and World-Security Studies, Hampshire CollegeIn big ways and small, in new relationships or marriages 20 years deep, we all say hell yes or hell no hundreds of times a day, in hundreds of ways.

The lesson might be phrased: \"Strange things happen when the political and entertainment worlds collide.\"Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comWhether or not to cover is a mother\u0027s personal decision, but regardless of her choice, she should be able to breastfeed in public with confidence, knowing that she is doing the best thing she possibly can for her baby.Mother, wife, and photographerISIS cannot be beaten from the air while the iron lung pumping oxygen into it -- the Assad regime -- is left to do its worst. Legitimate governance -- not war -- is the ultimate cure for a Syrian illness rapidly becoming a regional and global contagion. Yet without an effective, surgical intervention of a kinetic variety, the patient has no hope of surviving.Senior Fellow, Atlantic Council; Former U.S. Special Advisor on Transition in SyriaMy parents may be at fault for me romanticizing love.

Because sadly, that is much different than the modern love story of today, I asked them, separately how they\u0027ve made it work this long.Publicist in Beverly HillsA global ecological deficit is called overshoot, and today, August 13, is Earth Overshoot Day. Earth Overshoot Day marks the date when humanity\u0027s demand on renewable natural resources exceeds the supply that our planet can regenerate.
