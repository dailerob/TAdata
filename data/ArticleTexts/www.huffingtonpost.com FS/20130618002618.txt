{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Simon JohnsonAuthor, \u0027White House Burning: The Founding Fathers, Our National Debt, and Why It Matters To You\u0027Global megabanks are pushing back hard against the idea that additional reforms are needed -- beyond what is supposed to be implemented as part of the Dodd-Frank 2010 financial legislation. The latest salvo comes from Goldman Sachs which, in a recent report, denied there is any such thing as downside protection provided by the official sector to creditors of \"too big to fail\" financial conglomerates. The Goldman document appears hot on the heels of similar arguments in papers by such organizations as Davis Polk, the Bipartisan Policy Center, and JP Morgan Chase. This is not any kind of conspiracy but rather parallel messages expressed by people with convergent interests, perhaps with the thought that a steady drumbeat will help sway the consensus back towards the banks\u0027 point of view. But the Goldman Sachs team actually concedes that too big to fail does exist -- punching a big hole in the case painstakingly built by its allies.Comments (105)Steven StraussAdjunct Lecturer in Public Policy, Harvard Kennedy SchoolReasonable people would agree that a bank having a history of involvement with fraud and mismanagement (and a recipient of one of the largest bank bailouts) shouldn\u0027t be writing bank legislation. Unless, of course, you are the U.S. Congress doing business as usual.Comments (245)Maureen RyanTV critic, The Huffington PostTonight we found out that Bob is not truly a product of the great state of Wisconsin (your loss, Cheddarheads). His identity is as thin and fragile as the pathetic map tacked up on his office wall.Comments (146)Tom EngelhardtEditor, TomDispatch.comWashington\u0027s urge to take control of the global communications environment, lock, stock, and chat room, to gather its \"data\" -- billions and billions of pieces of it -- and so turn the world into a secret set of connections, represents a remarkable development.Comments (21)Melanie CurtinFounder, Vixen On The LooseThis is in an attempt to spare both you, my fine male friends, as well as myself and other women, the cringe-inducing effects of such attempts at, um, seduction.Comments (1,141)Dan FroomkinExecutive Editor, FearlessMedia.orgEven in this day of fragmented audiences and decimated newsrooms, major news organizations still have the ability to spark a national conversation around a given issue, by putting experienced, tenacious beat reporters on the story. So what\u0027s needed is a new beat, to cover secrecy itself.Comments (13)Flynt and Hillary Mann LeverettAuthors, \u0027Going to Tehran\u0027; Penn State Professor and American University Senior LecturerIf the Obama administration wants to engage a new Rohani administration effectively, and to put U.S.-Iranian relations on a more positive trajectory, it will need to overhaul U.S. policy in four fundamental ways.CommentsRichard BransonFounder, Virgin GroupIt shouldn\u0027t just be left to politicians and community organizations to tackle the world\u0027s problems -- businesses should help, too. Although individually lots of businesses do great things, collectively they could be far more powerful and do much more good.CommentsJohn PavleyCTO @ The Huffington Post, BloggerI believe the iron triangle applies to almost every human endeavor. From throwing a party to keeping a marriage alive for 28 years, no plan survives its first encounter with reality. The only real question is which corner of the iron triangle am I going to compromise on?Comments (21)Newt GingrichFormer U.S. Speaker of the House of Representatives and GOP presidential candidateAnyone who has been paying attention knows that bureaucrats throughout the government are routinely abusing their power to advance their ideology and that of the current administration. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the administration\u0027s aggressive obstruction of American energy.Comments (206)Carole Brody FleetSpeaker and Award-Winning Author, \"Happily Even After…\" and \"Widows Wear Stilettos…\"This month\u0027s Dating Faux Pas Prevention continues with another subject of concern to many; what are the two of you going to talk about on that first date?Comments (75)Matthew CookeWriter-director, How To Make Money Selling DrugsDrug war supporters think Americans might tear apart the fabric of society if we were legally allowed to consume whatever plants or chemicals we chose. This is not based in fact.Comments (147)Phyllis CuttinoDirector, Clean Energy, The Pew Charitable TrustsTesla\u0027s repayment of a Department of Energy loan nine years ahead of schedule is welcome news and another indication that use of electric vehicles is growing -- both here and around the globe.CommentsMike WeisserThe Gun GuyWe may be headed towards Round 2 of the gun control fight, in which case the NRA will begin kicking and screaming about how expanding the national criminal background check system will ultimately lead to the confiscation of guns. But is the argument really about \"constitutional rights\"? Or is the real argument about something else?Comments (1,002)Mark SandlinPC(USA) Minister \u0026 co-founder of The Christian LeftNow, I love Superman but I will not be preaching about how Superman is like Jesus. There won\u0027t even be a children\u0027s sermon. Why? Violence. That\u0027s why.Comments (520)Jon Soltz and Sen. Tom UdallRecent history and the current intelligence on the ground supports the conclusion that the risks are just too great. After over a decade of war overseas, now is not the time to arm an unorganized, unfamiliar, and unpredictable group of rebels.Comments (63)Melissa T. ShultzEssayist, Award-Winning JournalistLast year I wasn\u0027t as smart or as old. This year, on the occasion of my birthday, I\u0027m making notes. I want to remember what I\u0027ve learned.CommentsJordan SchultzThe Huffington Post\u0027s sports columnist, The Schultz ReportWith the San Antonio Spurs leading the NBA Finals 3 games to 2, the question becomes, can Spoelstra respond? Will he stay with a smaller lineup, or will he re-insert Chris Andersen for some much-needed shot blocking?CommentsJoe RobinsonWork-life balance, stress management educator, speaker, and author, \u0027Work to Live\u0027\u0027The stress epidemic has gone uncontested for too long. We can change that by becoming a nation of first responders, creating a social movement of people who reach out when someone is in need, who talk and listen, not look the other way, who can be Stress Lookouts and Disrupters.Comments (17)Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027We have almost reached a tipping point where majorities of Americans who want government to be on their side look in vain for a government that actually serves them.Comments (294)João Vale de AlmeidaEuropean Union Ambassador to the United StatesIf EU and the U.S. can show that we want to open markets and resist protectionism even in this moment of crisis, it will send a powerful signal to the rest of the world about the continuing strength of the international economic order.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorAs the fiscal picture has improved, both through actions we\u0027ve taken already and the improving economy, it\u0027s much tougher to make the hair-on-fire urgency case that drove this benighted debate in recent years.Comments (25)Gordon BrownFormer Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationMalala Yousafzai -- the 15-year-old Pakistani girl militants tried to assassinate -- is the first signatory of a new worldwide petition launched today after terrorists, hell-bent on preventing girls being educated, murdered 14 students at an all girls\u0027 college in Pakistan.CommentsAdrian GrenierActor, filmmaker and entrepreneurFor too long we\u0027ve exclusively emphasized punishment for non-violent offenders over treatment and rehabilitation. The current system is unbalanced, unsustainable, and unnecessarily cruel. It\u0027s time to legalize or at the very least, decriminalize all drugs.Comments (54)Mark MooreFounder and CEO, MANA NutritionSince I spend my days at a company that makes products to fight malnutrition, I could not help but notice that Theo Jansen was born just after one of the most noted and awful famines of modern times.CommentsMáirtín Ó MuilleoirLord Mayor of BelfastToday, the Obamas saw a Belfast transformed by two decades of peacemaking which only bore fruit because of the dogged determination of Irish America. President Obama reaffirmed America\u0027s commitment to stand with the peacemakers of Belfast as long as we continue to push forward.Comments (11)Jeff MadrickRoosevelt Institute Senior Fellow; author, \u0027Age of Greed\u0027Our jobs conference in early June covered a wide variety of potential solutions to what we call the jobs emergency, from major macro policies to local activist ones. Given how little is done in Washington to solve the problem, it is stunning how many good ideas are out there.CommentsJeffrey LaurentiSenior Fellow, The Century FoundationFresh from such a stunning upset, Rowhani will need quickly to show Iranians some results, in particular on the economic front. Rowhani now needs to persuade supreme leader Khamenei to give him the running room to try a new approach.CommentsDr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarThe first step towards getting a boss to loosen her grip is to remove any possibility from her mind that she needs to be that way. Get to work on time. Meet deadlines. Be productive. Make clients happy.Comments (85)Blake KernenA 7th grader from Morristown-Beard School, New JerseyEvery dog has his day, and this Friday, June 21, just happens to be a really big one. It\u0027s Take Your Dog to Work Day, your four-legged friend\u0027s turn to prove who is truly the boss.CommentsRichard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureBorn at the dawn of the Reagan era, Millennials were the first generation to be fully subjected to the all-out assault of the idea that we take care of each other in this country. Some of us are the parents of Millenials, and we wonder: who will fight with them, and for them?Comments (547)Dean Baker, 2013.17.06Chris Weigant, 2013.17.06Richard Branson, 2013.17.06Youth Radio -- Youth Media International, 2013.17.06Peter Navarro, 2013.17.06Roy Speckhardt, 2013.17.06Connor Ryan, 2013.17.06Isaac Zablocki, 2013.17.06Jeff Danziger, 2013.17.06Daniel Garrie, 2013.17.06Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"YOU\u0027LL SEE ONLY WHAT I WANT YOU TO SEE!",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
