{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week saw the ongoing implosion of a once-likable figure who gave a crazy interview, refused to apologize, and made it worse the more he kept talking. I\u0027m referring, of course, to Mike Huckabee (sorry, Charlie) -- who, in an interview with a birther radio host, repeatedly claimed that Obama\u0027s worldview, particularly \"his view of the Brits,\" was shaped by \"having grown up in Kenya.\" When it was pointed out that Obama never even visited Kenya until 1987, Huckabee claimed he\u0027d misspoken and meant to say Indonesia -- even though it was a Dutch, not a British, colony. This pandering to the worst elements of the Obama-hating fringe is especially disappointing because Huckabee has previously dared to speak eloquently against immigrant bashing and in favor of poverty fighting. Now he\u0027d rather channel his inner Dan Quayle and criticize unwed-but-pregnant Natalie Portman. Maybe he misspoke and meant to slam Bristol Palin.Read Post | CommentsLance Armstrong and Don Perata, 03.02.2011We hate cancer.

He would like to get into the news by attacking Natalie Portman. Why? Because she is engaged and pregnant and not married yet.Read Post | CommentsElvis Costello, 03.01.2011Singer-songwriterThese days it might court shallow mockery to sing so openly of our humanity, mortality and divinity but not with music to make these themes fly or words containing such wit, grace and humility.Read Post | CommentsLaurie David, 03.02.2011Producer/Author/NRDC TrusteeThere\u0027s something seriously wrong with a food system that requires 80 percent of the country\u0027s antibiotics just to maintain itself.
