Corbyn is one. In many respects, Blair and others like him of that era did more damage to a decent Europe than his predecessor, the arch-Tory Margaret Thatcher. The Thatcher revolution brought an aggressive free-market conservatism to Britain. Blair neutered the ability of the main opposition party reverse it. Corbyn, with all of his deficiencies, is payback for the sins of Blair-ism. Thatcher\u0027s slogan was TINA, standing for There Is No Alternative. Blair-ism might have been represented by a variation -- TINO: There Is No Opposition. Well, now there is.If we ignore the warnings of science and don\u0027t start investing in clean technologies, climate shocks will push countries into panic-inducing scarcity, inspiring everything from ethnic and religious conflict in Africa and the Middle East, to imperial land grabs by a hungry and worried China.Professor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027As for issues like paid family leave and keeping Social Security intact that would make the lives of women better, Carly Fiorina\u0027s campaign statements are resoundingly silent.Money Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsWith the U.S. military having withdrawn many of its forces from Iraq and Afghanistan, most Americans would be forgiven for being unaware that hundreds of U.S. bases and hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops still encircle the globe.Assistant Professor of Anthropology, American UniversityReal friends of Israel should not provide him cover. They should insist instead that Israel (and Jews) and Bibi are not one and the same. For years Bibi\u0027s backers in the U.S. have sought to undermine American Jewish support for the Democrats, hoping for a right-wing realignment of American, American Jewish, and Israeli politics. This ambition needs to be frustrated.Co-Editor Emeritus, Dissent Magazine and Author, \u0027Zion and State: Nation, Class, and the Shaping of Modern Israel\u0027When I think about the type of unconditional love we hope to receive from others when we come out and the type of unconditional love we hope to share with another for the rest of our lives, I think of my grandparents. That\u0027s the type of love we come out for.Co-Founder Be The Change Revolutions, Co-Founder Changers of Commerce, Keynote Speaker, Advisory Board No Kid Hungry, Federal Club Council Human Right\u0027s CampaignThe U.S.\u0027 current response today is as anemic as it has been since the conflict in Syria erupted four years ago. In that time the U.S. has only given asylum to 1,300 refugees from Syria. In 2013, the number of Syrian refugees allowed into the U.S. was a shockingly low number: 90.Professor of Transnational and Borderlands History at Lewis \u0026 Clark College in Portland, OregonThe issue over the Iran deal, what\u0027s most likely -- allowing Tehran to race to a bomb now, or delaying that perhaps forever if Iran, in 15 years, chooses a strong economy over being a nuclear pariah? Why wouldn\u0027t they? Then: who\u0027s more worried -- Hillary because of falling polls, or GOP because of Trump\u0027s rising ones?Host, \u0027Both Sides Now\u0027The evidence thus far seems to strongly suggest that inadequate sleep duration increases the likelihood of becoming ill following an infection and hinders our body\u0027s ability to fight infection. Conversely, getting enough sleep may be one of our most powerful antibiotics to keep us healthy.Board Certified Pediatric Sleep and Pulmonary physician, researcher, and advocate for better sleep.Iran\u0027s negotiating terms are bad news for Syria. It reportedly offered to end the assault on Zabadani on two conditions: that its fighters be allowed to evacuate Fu\u0027a and Kefraya, and that Zabadani\u0027s largely Sunni population leave the city.Resident Fellow at the Atlantic Council, focusing on Syria and its neighbors.Student debt many Americans took on in their youth is following them to the grave. Now many of these student debtors are seniors whose Social Security benefits are being garnished to continue to pay those loans they took out a lifetime ago.Senior Fellow, Advanced Leadership Initiative, Harvard University. Co-founder, National Student Debt Jubilee ProjectCo-Director, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureSenior Fellow, Advanced Leadership Initiative, Harvard University. Co-Founder and President Emeritus, Presidio Graduate SchoolThe authorities don\u0027t learn. They don\u0027t take into account that the bars magnify a political leader and the pain suffered in the cells hangs on his chest like a medal won on the bloodiest battlefield.Award-winning Cuban bloggerBlack lives, a durable fiber of our nation\u0027s history, are also fraying due to stresses beyond the criminal justice system, with many of the root causes directly related to health.Physician, healthcare innovator, and cultural enthusiastSarah Palin is no longer a candidate, but her influence lives on. Donald Trump is the Republican frontrunner and Ted Cruz is eager to take his place if he falters. Both knew that if they wanted someone to rile up a crowd, Palin was their woman. In very few groups is Glenn Beck one of the least embarrassing people.President, People For the American WayAfter the U.S. spent decades pursuing a failed \u0027quiet diplomacy\u0027 approach to promoting rights and freedom in Tibet and China, now is the time for the President to turn up the volume and speak out publicly.Tibetan Independence Activist and Director of Tibet Action InstituteThe susceptibility of even celebrated black men to be hauled off when there\u0027s even the slightest suspicion -- mistaken or otherwise -- of criminal wrongdoing has left many police officials red-faced with embarrassment when they realized their goof. This was the case with Blake.Author and political analystAt 17, my high school friend Taylor broke her back. Without authorization she became a paraplegic poster child, reiterating her story to friends and entitled strangers alike again and again. Four years later, Taylor has a more intricate perspective of the female disabled experience.ArtistIt wasn\u0027t that long ago that the pundits had the 2016 presidential contest pegged as a Clinton-Bush match-up. While that may still occur, I wouldn\u0027t place a bet on it.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Prophetic grief can spur action and change; instead of focusing on the one who murders, we need to focus on the larger culture that fosters hatred and violence. It\u0027s easier to deal with the \u0027who\u0027 and singularize the crime and make one person responsible and thereby excuse ourselves.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundIn different ways, Obama\u0027s 2008 campaign and Trump\u0027s current crusade skillfully build on the awesome force of audacious promises. Their underlying strategies are simple: list the major ills that have people worried and guarantee their quick elimination, as if by a magic wand. But why are people ready to make the leap of faith with so little justification and so much at stake?Psychologist, Investigator, National Center for the Study of Terrorism and the Response to Terrorism, University of MarylandHis first impression long ago faded away. By contrast, even though Trump has been famous since the 1980s, this is most voters\u0027 first real exposure to him as a Presidential candidate. His narcissistic aura has not yet worn off. Thankfully, narcissism is a wasting assetAssistant Professor, Harvard Business School, Author, Indispensable: When Leaders Really MatterIt\u0027s important for oil companies to make their perspectives known when it comes to legislation that could affect their industry. But it is just as important for people who may fall victim to forest fires, floods, crop losses, loss of tourism and disease to have their perspectives heard.Author, When Money TalksIt\u0027s like a trance has been broken, and they all of a sudden remembered that looking at that guy in the chair is \"wrong.\" That by looking at me in that way, they have somehow deviated from the cultural norms that my disability defies. What if I told you I want you to stare at me? What if I told you that in these spaces, I long to be stared at?Founder/Co-Director, Deliciously Disabled ConsultingSelf-compassion is being aware of your own suffering with an interior response that is supportive and kind rather than harsh (I made a bad mistake but I\u0027m a good man and I can find a way to get through it).
