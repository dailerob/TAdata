{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundIn the spring of 1954, like so many Black families, mine waited anxiously for the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision. My father and I talked about it and what it would mean for my future and the future of millions of other Black children who were attending segregated but unequal Black schools. He died the week before Brown was decided. But I and many other children were able, in later years, to walk through the new and heavy doors that Brown slowly and painfully opened. Now, the most recent findings from the U.S. Department of Education\u0027s Civil Rights Data Collection, called the \"richest, fullest\" collection so far for measuring education access and equity in our nation\u0027s public schools, show many children are still receiving an unequal education. This is the unfinished work of the Civil Rights Movement.What if most of us aren\u0027t \"gay\" or \"straight,\" but somewhere in between? Artist and activist iO Tillett Wright makes a passionate case for accepting the complexity of individuality -- without making anybody feel like a second-class citizen. If her words don\u0027t persuade you, the images she shares just might.TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"Simple question. Are you Nigerian? If not, I have news you. You can\u0027t do anything about the girls missing in Nigeria. You can\u0027t. Your insistence on urging American power, specifically American military power, to address this issue will ultimately hurt the people of Nigeria.Jumoke BalogunCo-Founder of CompareAfrique.comIn commemoration of our ninth birthday, here\u0027s a look back at nine memorable blog posts since 2005 -- one from each year.The Huffington Post BlogWhat piece of advice did your mother give you that has had a lasting impact?Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistThere was a noticeable change this week. Republicans as a whole seem to be pivoting away from their stated singular campaign theme of \"Obamacare is the root of all the country\u0027s problems.\"Chris WeigantPolitical writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comBeau CoffronHusband, father and blogger, LunchboxDad.comWhat troubled me most was that Kerry, after acknowledging that many Israelis have offered the same warning, apologized for using the word \"apartheid\" saying that \"it is a word best left out of the debate here at home.\" In other words, Israelis can have this debate, but we can\u0027t.James ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027The name of Washington, D.C.\u0027s football team is a racial slur, a racist epithet. The U.S. trademark office agrees; so does the dictionary. But more importantly, Native American people feel it. How important is that to the rest of us? That is the moral question for all of us: Are we going to show respect for our nation\u0027s original citizens?Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersI have a friend who lovingly placed her child for adoption because she was too young to be a mother herself. While she\u0027s comforted by the feeling that she made the right choice, there remains in her a sense of longing -- the innate desire to be a mother. Mother\u0027s Day reminds her of those things.Seth Adam SmithAuthor and Blogger at SethAdamSmith.comWe are taught to believe that everyone thinks the same way, that everyone is in control of their own mind, and that free will operates under their command. This is the paradox of living with a chronic and disabling thought disorder. We know differently. Everyone knows differently.Henry Boy JenkinsBlogger, BringChange2Mind.orgWe believe that Niebuhr\u0027s early support for a future Jewish homeland in Palestine, and his practical concerns about the difficulties the project entailed, must be recalled now, when a document fiercely critical of Israel is making its way around the nation\u0027s largest Presbyterian denomination.Gustav NiebuhrElisabeth SiftonI have been watching Russian and French television all day, and for the former, fascinating TV agitprop -- ????? ???????? ? ?????????? -- set against the grand fireworks display in Moscow and Sebastopol.Michael VlahosIs thinking positive and cultivating a happy and balanced outlook important to people with cancer? Absolutely. Is telling someone else to think positive even the slightest bit helpful? Not at all. And don\u0027t get me started on The Secret.Dr. Nikhil JoshiPhysician, speaker and author of \u0027The End of Suffering\u0027When those of us who are childless by circumstance -- and the majority of childless women want or wanted children within the context of a relationship -- don\u0027t speak honestly about our experience, we continue to remain the silent majority.Melanie NotkinFounder and national bestselling author of Savvy Auntie. Author, Otherhood, March 4, 2014,Michael ShawPublisher of the visual politics and media literacy site, BagNewsNotesThere is no shortage of things you can stress about in high school. We know this. But prom -- and promposals, for that matter -- isn\u0027t (and shouldn\u0027t be) one of them.Taylor TrudonEditor, HuffPost TeenWe have many things in common, however, there is a major difference between us: I have been refused the right to raise my children with my husband, their father, at my side.Patricia GuillenRetired educator from the Houston Independent School DistrictI was 16 at the time my mother came out, and she seemed so much happier than when she was married to my cold, withholding, unfaithful father. So I was happy for her. She raised me to have an open mind about these things, and not judge people by the color of their skin, or who they loved, or what they worshiped. She raised me to judge them by their words and their actions.David Henry SterryAuthor, activist, performer, muckraker, book doctorWe\u0027ve been able to get to the bottom of nine common spirits myths and what we\u0027ve found is, to be honest, quite mind-blowing.Liquor.comLiquor.comSome people consider themselves highly educated and lettered literarians, but in fact they are often ULTRACREPIDARIAN -- a word which refers to someone who gives an opinion on things s/he knows nothing about.Oliver TearleAuthor; Lecturer in English, Loughborough Univ.Let\u0027s celebrate with the same spirit as the women whose activism sparked the holiday in the first place. Let\u0027s celebrate by taking action. Support the women around us. Fight for family-focused public policy. Lift up women in office who are writing these policies, and elect more women like them. A card is nice. Change is better.Barbara LeePresident, Barbara Lee Political Office and Barbara Lee Family FoundationMedia coverage of drugs and drug policy has grown much more sophisticated in the past quarter-century. Yet many journalists still often use inaccurate, offensive, or just plain absurd language that would be considered unthinkable when covering any other issue.Jag DaviesPublications Manager, Drug Policy AllianceA lot of people say that Mother\u0027s Day is one of those \"Hallmark holidays\" that don\u0027t really exist in the calendar, and I can certainly see their point. The commercialization of Mother\u0027s Day doesn\u0027t enhance anyone\u0027s idea of family. But there\u0027s another way that society is \"dumbing down\" motherhood that we must name and shame.Terry O\u0027NeillPresident, National Organization for WomenI had a conversation years ago with Grigory Yavlinsky, who lost to Putin in Russia\u0027s 2000 presidential election. When I asked what Putin was like, Yavlinsky said, \"He has the mind of a mid-level KGB officer.\" That struck me as right then, and in the years since and especially in the last couple of months I think Yavlinsky has been proven right.Ted KaufmanFmr. U.S. Senator from DelawareThe situation in Nigeria has focused us on the plight of these abducted girls, but were we blind before to this possibility? It always takes a current event to snap us out of our collective fog, to clear away the cobwebs of our own inaction and make us take notice. What can we do to help them and to make our Mother\u0027s Day mean a little more?Jamie Lee CurtisActress and children\u0027s book authorConsider how much time you commit to shaping your ass versus the time you commit to opening your heart. Let\u0027s redefine what the face of sexy looks like.Jesse BrunePersonal trainer; chef; co-founder and director, Project Service LAThe Common Core is not a national curriculum, because it is not a curriculum at all. It is only a set of standards, and that\u0027s completely different from the scope and sequence of curriculum planning. But like that terrible Match.com date you went on, the standards/curriculum distinction only looks good on paper.Peter GreeneTeacher, writerOnce upon a time, etiquette was important.Bon AppetitBon Appétit MagazineMy commitment to organics is to make sure I do my part to leave my children with a better, healthier planet. It\u0027s not just about today and this moment -- rather, it\u0027s about doing things with expanded thought and an interest in seeing a healthier future.Bill CouzensFounder, Lesscancer.orgOften I would wonder, \"What\u0027s wrong with me? Why doesn\u0027t he like me?\" My mother helped me realize that this line of thinking was becoming self-destructive.Tamara Duricka JohnsonJournalist and author of \u002731 Dates in 31 Days\u0027Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"NFL, MEET 2014",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
