{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jason LinkinsEditor, Eat the PressIdle hands are the devil\u0027s playground, especially during these dog days of summer where the \"news\" is supposedly \"slow.\" And so it really shouldn\u0027t be all that surprising that the hot new thing among the people who have twiddled their thumbs nearly to death is a fresh load of piping-hot blather over maybe, you know, impeaching President Barack Obama. And I have to admit, what the idea lacks in merit, it more than makes up for in being sort of exciting, in the way that daft people launching homemade flying machines off of a cliff can be exciting.Comments (7,646)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future1963: The Shirelles were topping the charts. The Fugitive  was a hit TV show. John Kennedy was in the White House. Jackie\u0027s pillbox hats were the height of fashion. And the minimum wage, when adjusted for inflation, was $8.37, a dollar and 12 cents higher than today\u0027s rate of $7.25.Comments (512)John GlaserEditor at Antiwar.comU.S. airstrikes won\u0027t neuter Assad\u0027s ability to continue to fight, may prompt worse violence from Assad, and may even directly kill more Syrian civilians. It seems clear these airstrikes are not about preventing more regime violence or saving the Syrian people. So what are they about?Comments (276)James ClearEntrepreneur, weightlifter, and travel photographerWhat got you here won\u0027t get you there. If you want to see different results, you have to do something different. If you want to see progress each week, then you have to progress each week.Comments (123)Lincoln MitchellHarriman Institute, Columbia UniversityHillary Clinton deserves credit for her good work at the State Department, but that tenure will very possibly be seen differently by 2016, and not because of Benghazi. The direction of foreign policy during the Obama administration will not fade away.CommentsCT Working Moms25 working moms juggling motherhood and a careerWe play for awhile till it\u0027s dinnertime. Sometimes, I\u0027m just so in awe of how cool she is and how fast she\u0027s growing up that I stare at her like this:Comments (36)Alon Ben-MeirSenior Fellow, NYU\u0027s Center for Global AffairsAmerica\u0027s standing and what is left of its credibility in the eyes of the international community is on the line. The burden falls squarely on President Obama\u0027s shoulders to act to save lives rather than preach the gospel of human rights, as there is no time left to spare.Comments (35)Carol HartsellSenior Comedy Editor, The Huffington PostI think you and I are exactly alike in practically every way. We both live in New York City. We both like Auburn. We both enjoy biking. We both wear cargo shorts even though every single other person in the world thinks they\u0027re stupid. You were in Blood Diamond and I want one.CommentsSusan Blumenthal, M.D.Public Health Editor, The Huffington Post; Former U.S. Assistant Surgeon GeneralHopefully, as the problem of food deserts and swamps gains greater recognition, communities will implement innovative and creative solutions. The USDA\u0027s Healthy Food Financing Initiative should focus on supporting this kind of innovation in communities across the country.CommentsLorie EberEntrepreneurWe all need to slow down and stop rushing headlong through life like we\u0027re on a bullet train. Here are some good ways to decrease your stress level.Comments (43)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorI wish I could see a way out of this ridiculous debt ceiling fight. Why ridiculous? Because remember, the money that the government needs to borrow in excess of the current debt ceiling is money they\u0027ve already agreed to spend.CommentsDiane RavitchHistorian, NYU professorBill de Blasio knows that public education will suffer if the NYC continues on its present course of privatization, high-stakes testing and closing of neighborhood schools. He understands that churn and disruption are bad for children, bad for families, bad for schools and bad for communities.Comments (14)Robert NaimanPolicy Director, Just Foreign PolicyIf President Obama can get us into war in Syria without prior Congressional approval, it will set a terrible precedent: A future president could get us more easily into war in Iran without prior Congressional approval.Comments (165)Cecilia MuñozDirector of the Domestic Policy CouncilAs we reflect on the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, much has been said about what has changed in fifty years -- and what has not changed enough.CommentsLisa BelkinSenior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, The Huffington PostSo how are you feeling about things this morning? About your career? About the response to your grinding declaration of adulthood on the VMAs last night?Comments (1,061)Jeff DanzigerPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideComments (35)Anne TheriaultFeminist bloggerI saw many prominent white feminists use their sizeable platforms to defend Miley\u0027s right to rub her ass on Robin Thicke while wearing flesh-coloured bra and panties. I watched as those same people remained embarrassingly silent about Miley\u0027s behaviour towards black women and black culture.Comments (316)Jason SattlerExecutive Editor, NationalMemo.com -- @LOLGOP on TwitterSpeaker John Boehner did something extraordinary this week, something akin to a parent posting a positive drug test on his or her child\u0027s Facebook page.CommentsDick SimonChairman, Co-founder, YPO/WPO Peace Action NetworkWhile almost everyone who is here in D.C. this week agrees that much has changed since that momentous day, they all are quick to add that there is still more that needs to be done before King\u0027s dream is finally realized.CommentsMarty KaplanDirector, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolOn the surface, the fight between the GOP and NBC is about the effects of media on audiences. The party\u0027s presumption -- based on no evidence -- is that the miniseries would put Clinton in a favorable light, and -- also based on no evidence -- that the halo would translate into votes.Comments (58)Paul ArmentanoDeputy Director, NORML; co-author, \u0027Marijuana Is Safer, So Why Are We Driving People to Drink?\u0027NIDA and other government agencies are privy to this information, of course, yet they willfully choose to ignore it -- as does the Obama administration. It shouldn\u0027t.Comments (490)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkHalf a century after Dr. King\u0027s momentous march, we must continue to push for justice and equality; anything less will be a disservice to the memory of this great leader and all those that paved the way 50 years ago.Comments (291)Ariel DorfmanAuthorWhat would he say if he could return to contemplate what his country has become? What if he could see how the terror brought to bear on 9/11 had turned his people into a fearful, vengeful nation, ready to stop dreaming, ready to abridge their own freedoms in order to be secure?CommentsFarahnaz ZahidiWriter and editorWe are honestly just as normal or as crazy as the rest of the women of the world. We laugh. We cry. We make mistakes. We are women who earn for their families and we are women who are home-makers, or we are both.Comments (34)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The wealth of the Walton family -- which still owns the lion\u0027s share of Walmart stock -- now exceeds the wealth of the bottom 40 percent of American families combined.Comments (1,135)Mary SchmidtWriter, Bay Area1. Most of the time, you don\u0027t know anything about anything. That was true when you were 15 and that will be true when you are 65. You do, however, know how to be a good person and you know how to follow your heart. Keep doing that and you\u0027ll be just fine.CommentsCharlie NoxDating coachWhile I don\u0027t go searching for men in relationships, I also don\u0027t pretend I feel nothing when it\u0027s not the case. I won\u0027t try to sleep with your boyfriend, and it\u0027s extremely unlikely, but I can\u0027t promise it won\u0027t ever happen.Comments (554)Sec. Kathleen Sebelius and Sec. Arne DuncanNo matter where any of us happens to live; no matter how young or old we happen to be, or whether we\u0027d rather be shooting hoops or playing video games, we never know when we\u0027ll need insurance. An injury, illness, or accident can strike anyone, at any time.Comments (13)Dr. Patricia FitzgeraldWellness Editor, The Huffington Post; Doctor of acupuncture and Oriental medicine; Nutritionist; AuthorWe\u0027ve decided to partner with the American Heart Association (AHA) to help close the knowledge gap. We are true soul mates in this marriage: Both HuffPost and the AHA are passionately committed to promoting ways to improve health and decrease stress.CommentsAlastair CrookeFmr. MI-6 agent; Author, \u0027Resistance: The Essence of Islamic Revolution\u0027The Middle East is both angry and frightened, too; it is bitterly divided and increasingly violent. To toss a few cruise missiles into this volatile, unstable brew simply is to invite the unforeseeable and the unwanted to make its explosive appearance.Comments (19)Ryan CostelloPolicy Fellow, National Iranian American CouncilInstead of heading into Syria guns blazing, the Obama administration should use new leverage for action to galvanize multilateral diplomacy to de-escalate the conflict and facilitate a transfer of power. There is reason to believe such an effort could bear fruit.CommentsJanet Blair Page, 2013.27.08Lincoln Mitchell, 2013.27.08Rashad Robinson, 2013.27.08Osi Mizrahi, 2013.27.08Judith Johnson, 2013.27.08Andy Plesser, 2013.27.08The Daily Meal, 2013.27.08Lauri Lyons, 2013.27.08David Harris, 2013.27.08Dan Solin, 2013.27.08Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"WARPATH",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
