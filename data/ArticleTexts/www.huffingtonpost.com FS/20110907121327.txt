{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"With a new class of students starting college this month -- replacing a class that just graduated into a historically bad job market -- there\u0027s no better time for another installment of our \"Majoring in Debt\" series, which examines the mountainous student debt college graduates are facing, how it will affect their futures, and what it will mean for the future of America. When I was 16 and living in Greece, I saw a magazine article about Cambridge and was overcome by a desire to study there. And I was lucky enough to get in. In the years after graduating, pretty much every break I got could be traced back to that experience.
