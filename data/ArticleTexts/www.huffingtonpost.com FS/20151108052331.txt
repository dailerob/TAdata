The urgency arrived on Thursday in the form of a major report compiled from 33 different research groups that found that \"human-caused climate change\" played a role in at least 14 extreme weather events last year. The action came a day later as President Obama, on the eve of the U.N. Climate Change Conference in Paris, announced the rejection of the Keystone XL pipeline, saying the project would \"undercut\" America\u0027s \"global leadership\" on climate change. \"If we want to prevent the worst effects of climate change before it\u0027s too late, the time to act is now,\" he said. \"Not later.
