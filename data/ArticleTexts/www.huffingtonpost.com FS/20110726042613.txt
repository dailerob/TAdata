{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"There is still no deal in the debt ceiling impasse between Congressional Republicans and the president, so we can\u0027t say who \"won.\" But we can definitely say who lost: America. Even if we ultimately get the touted \"Grand Bargain,\" it\u0027s not going be grand for anybody who correctly identifies unemployment and our economy\u0027s anemic growth as the biggest crises we\u0027re facing. After the champagne has been uncorked and lots of backs have been slapped in DC, the lives of regular Americans will not be better -- indeed, they will almost certainly be worse. Here\u0027s the maddening part: if Congress and the president had focused on the crisis of jobs and growth, the solutions they would have come up with would also have been the best solutions to the long-term debt crisis. The fact is, you can cut all the discretionary spending you want -- but it\u0027s growth, not cutting that will solve our long-term deficit problem.Read Post | CommentsNorman Lear, 7/25/11Founder, People for the American WayThe New York Times story this Sunday covering the bombing and the slaughter in Norway by a Christian Fundamentalist ends with these words from a researcher at the London School of Economics.Read Post | CommentsPamela Kripke, 7/25/11Journalist, TeacherSome might say I could have waited until we were wheeled out of the operating room, but I began the conversation early. \"Listen, there will be male people in the nursery,\" I warned, the moment her beanie-clad head hit my bosom. \"Do not worry.\"Read Post | CommentsMarty Kaplan, 7/25/11Director, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolThere is nothing like an English accent to make bulls--t sound like Shakespeare. But it was the King\u0027s English Rebekah Brooks spoke at the hearing that made me wonder if I was being too hard on her.Read Post | CommentsRobert Reich, 7/25/11Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Aftershock\u0027Republicans are proposing to cut the budget deficit this year and next, which will result in more job losses. And Democrats, from the president on down, seem unable or unwilling to present a bold jobs plan to reverse the vicious cycle of unemployment.Read Post | CommentsLeo Hindery, Jr., 7/25/11Chairman, U.S. Economy/Smart Globalization Initiative at the New America FoundationWashington is often a city of Chicken Littles, which makes ringing the alarm bell difficult. But once Washington wakes up from its deficit hangover, politicians will realize the sky has already fallen. Here\u0027s what we can and need to do.Read Post | CommentsMark C. Miller, 7/25/11HumoristWhen people exclaim, \"My feet are killing me!\", it\u0027s usually in reference to severe foot problems or improperly fitting shoes. Unfortunately, for Cary Hopper, the problem was even more dangerous.Read Post | CommentsRobert Kuttner, 7/24/11Co-founder and co-editor, The American ProspectAt some point this week, stock and bond markets will begin to start swooning, and the usual wise guys will begin making high-risk bets at the expense of financial stability as a whole. Obama will be revealed to be holding more of the cards -- if he starts playing his hand well (for a change).Read Post | CommentsLarry Strauss, 7/25/11Veteran high school English teacher, basketball coach, novelistIf we believe in the ideal of a meritocracy how can we support a system that favors birth rite over achievement?Read Post | CommentsBenjamin R. Barber, 7/25/11Democratic theorist; Author, \u0027Strong Democracy\u0027, \u0027Jihad vs. McWorld\u0027What we can\u0027t do is have it both ways -- talk number one and behave like number 34. Proclaim our superiority and privatize or close down every meaningful public program.Read Post | CommentsMohamed el-Erian, 7/24/11CEO and co-CIO, Pacific Investment Management CompanyIt will come down to the wire; and when the stopgap compromise is reached, many in Washington will declare victory and claim credit for averting a national disaster. Yet the resolution will likely be temporary, and the damage will be real and long-lasting.Read Post | CommentsRicky Gervais, 7/25/11Actor, writer, comedian, director, producerMy next tour is called \"Humanity\" and I\u0027d like your help with choosing the perfect image. Obviously as an artist it\u0027s important to evoke a strong reaction. But should I care beyond that how it affects people?Read Post | CommentsDean Baker, 7/25/11Co-Director of the Center for Economic and Policy ResearchThere is a full-fledged drive to cut social security benefits by lowering the annual cost of living adjustment for people already receiving benefits.Read Post | CommentsEirik Bergesen, 7/24/11Norwegian diplomat currently on leaveIf there was really ever such a thing as a hard rain falling, it fits the description of the rain that has pounded down on Oslo ever since the terror attack last Friday.Read Post | CommentsSteven Cohen, 7/25/11Executive Director, Columbia University’s Earth InstituteI find the discussion of deficits and cutting benefits curiously devoid of content. These cuts are not economic theories but economic realities; they have real impact on real people.Read Post | CommentsDavid Katz, M.D., 7/25/11Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterThere is a population -- an order of magnitude smaller -- for which it is vital to do so, and potentially even a matter of life and death.

The American Dream is in peril. It is time for the super-majority of Americans to be superheroes and rescue our economic future.Read Post | CommentsLincoln Mitchell, 7/25/11Harriman Institute, Columbia UniversityShould the U.S. not increase its debt ceiling, the country will likely face higher interest rates, another spike in joblessness, inability to pay basic expenses, and, almost inevitably, higher taxes in the not too distant future.Read Post | CommentsSimone Lewis-Koskinen, 7/25/11Program assistant, SeaWebMore people die while driving to the beach than while at the beach, let alone from shark attacks. In fact, more people die every year from toilet-bowl products or run-ins with a bucket than shark attacks.Read Post | CommentsClarence B. Jones, 7/24/11Scholar in Residence, Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute at Stanford UniversityAt the hastily called White House news conference following the collapse of discussions with Speaker John Boehner, President Obama rhetorically asked: \"Is there anything that the Republicans can say \u0027yes\u0027 to?\" Yes, there is: his resignation or re-election defeat.Read Post | CommentsAri Melber, 7/24/11Correspondent, The Nation; AttorneyBy fully caving on this stand-off, where the White House is backed by the general public and large swaths of the GOP, Obama would not only fail to impress independent voters, he\u0027d ensure a drubbing on a series of future fights.Read Post | CommentsRoger I.
