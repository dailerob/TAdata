{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureMost striking in the presidential campaign right now is the extent to which all of the major Democratic candidates have endorsed populist economic and political reforms. All three leading candidates have plans to raise taxes on the rich, crack down on corporate tax havens and loopholes, and limit capital gains tax breaks for investors. All support raising the minimum wage, guaranteeing paid family leave and paid vacation days, and empowering workers to organize and bargain collectively. All call for curbing the role of big money in politics. All favor action on climate change and a larger public investment in infrastructure and R\u0026D. The contrast with the Republican field is stark and clear. The growing populist movement in this country is driving this debate.Suppose we arm everyone -- do we really want to live in that kind of country and raise our children there? Or send our children to college on those campuses, as I will do for the first time next fall?Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersTwo weeks ago, America\u0027s first \"honest politician\" Gil Fulbright announced his bid for the White House. Fulbright is a satirical candidate cashing in on the flood of money in politics by doing whatever his donors want.Director, Represent.UsOur political system is built on the promise of democracy for all, not democracy for those who can afford to drive cross-state to get an ID. How can GOP leaders and presidential candidates continue to insist with a straight face that there\u0027s no need to restore protections for voters?Director of African American Religious Affairs, People For the American Way and People For the American Way FoundationAll empires fail and eventually devour themselves.

Here are eight toxic thoughts you need to let go of:Lifestyle writer, blogger, and cancer survivor sharing style, beauty, and wellness advice for women on HerAfter.comWestern diplomats are fond of legally and neatly putting things in boxes. Kremlin tactics are quite the opposite. Russian military thinking doesn\u0027t see a clean breakdown between what are weapons of war and what are civilian tools, or what are propaganda forums and what are channels for frank talks. The diplomats and talks are part of the offensive.Author, \u0027Fragile Empire: How Russia Fell In and Out of Love with Vladimir Putin\u0027Public brouhaha aside, from a climate change policy perspective, what is most troubling about this scandal is not what the company did, but the vulnerabilities it exposed in environmental policy.Research fellow at Stockholm Environment Institute, working on energy and climate change policiesSenior Research Fellow, Stockholm Environment InstituteHow dare you, Raven hyphen alternate spelling of \"Simone?\" Sitting there with a head full of colorful weave, the same sort of hair that was \"ghetto,\" \"tacky,\" \"low-class\" and \"unacceptable\" until it made it\u0027s way until the pages of mainstream fashion magazines?The premiere online magazine destination for African-American cultural insight, news and perspective.As Democrats get ready for a presidential debate in Las Vegas, it\u0027s clear that the Elizabeth Warren wing of American politics has fundamentally shifted the ground on which candidates will stand Tuesday night.Co-founder, Progressive Change Campaign Committee (BoldProgressives.org)Giant Wall Street banks continue to threaten the well-being of millions of Americans, but what to do?

Most Republicans say don\u0027t worry.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027As my mosque prepares to deal with an unfamiliar, terrifying influx of hatred in an unforgiving post-9/11 world, I can\u0027t help but think: I am so disappointed in you, Maryland. Can you still really call a place your home if you don\u0027t feel safe there anymore?Green Tea Enthusiast, Probably HungryAs Congress considers the federal budget in the coming months, we urge our colleagues in the House and Senate to join us in supporting robust funding for Guatemala.

Public is.Author of Swiped. Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and IDT911Following yet another mass shooting in Oregon leaving nine people dead and several injured, the GOP has, yet again, turned on the platitude generator, prepared their excuses, and spewed out another plethora of idiotic comments. That shooting was number 264 of the mass shootings in 274 days this year.Richard Zombeck is a freelance writer for hire and a contributor to www.nowitcounts.comElijah is an inspiring example to other young people--and all of us--of resilience, grace, and the ability to beat the odds.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundCan Bernie be elected? To be sure. If elected, could he be effective? Absolutely. Does his candidacy threaten the Democratic Party? Absolutely not; quite the contrary. What Bernie\u0027s rapid rise demonstrates is his own strength, flowing from the power of his ideas.Lecturer, author, editor, professor.Although it might be tempting to dismiss these protesters as part of a racist, fringe movement, not to be taken seriously, that would be a mistake. The organized anti-Muslim movement in this country is well-financed, well-organized and pervasive in American politics.Activist, blogger, waylaid CalifornianToday\u0027s topics include: Republicans in Disarray; Kevin McCarthy Drops Out of Speaker Race; Speaker Election Postponed; Boehner Begs Paul Ryan to Run; Ben Carson Is Totally Bananas; Ben Carson\u0027s Popeye\u0027s Stick Up; Ben Carson Doesn\u0027t Understand the Debt Ceiling; Babbleocity from Rocky Mountain Mike and Mary in Ann Arbor; Trump and the Colombian Woman; Jesse Ventura on the Two Party System; and much more.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027All people think of when they hear the word \"schizophrenia\" is the ramped-up media headlines about the very rare occurrences of people with the illness turning violent. The majority of people who experience schizophrenia are only likely to do harm to themselves.Leading the way to a better life for everyone affected by mental illness.US Secretary of Education Arne Duncan recently proposed to redirect $15 billion from correctional facilities toward increasing teachers\u0027 salaries in high poverty schools. It is both practical and eminently plausible. And with the right kind of leadership and advocacy, it might even become probable.Director of Strategic Planning for the Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race and Justice, Harvard Law SchoolRegardless of how much more we pour into Afghanistan, without forcing major political changes we are not going to see the results we have been seeking.

She has, in fact, a long record of verbally criticizing free-trade agreements, but then supporting them when in office.Author, \u0027Free Trade Doesn\u0027t Work: What Should Replace It and Why\u0027Sleep is the wonder drug for the feeling of well-being.

Founder and author, TBTPolitics.com.Trump as Speaker would also be the greatest campaign move in history. It is not a time-consuming job; all you have to do is make top-line decisions and make deals.
