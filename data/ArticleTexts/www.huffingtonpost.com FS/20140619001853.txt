{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor, historian, authorNeocons and elite media personalities who got everything wrong on Iraq now darken my TV screen telling me to ignore the invasion, the eight-year occupation, the lies about weapons of mass destruction, \"mushroom clouds\" becoming \"smoking guns,\" the torture at Abu Ghraib prison and everything else, and pretend the war started with General David Petraeus\u0027s miraculous \"surge\" where everything was wonderful in Iraq until the \"dove\" Obama pulled the plug. It\u0027s a nice narrative if your goal is partisan advantage, but like so much else we\u0027ve heard from policy elites regarding Iraq, it has nothing to do with reality.First, find who his or her biggest corporate donors are. Then check his or her record on policies that may impact the bottom lines of those companies. Does she support or oppose financial-sector reform? Has he recently signed a letter or released a statement opposing EPA curbs to coal-plant emissions?Senior Director of Strategy, Free PressThe Iraq disaster remains George W. Bush\u0027s enduring folly, and the Republican attempt to shift the blame to the Obama presidency is obscene nonsense. This was, and will always be, viewed properly as Bush\u0027s quagmire, a murderous killing field based on blatant lies.Editor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027I don\u0027t know the extent to which Court decisions necessarily reflect the prevailing mood, but if a new gun control bill comes back to Congress later this year, I\u0027m not quite ready to declare it dead.Mike the Gun GuyThe welfare state has been dismantled, leaving a much greater number of Americans without a safety net. And the further the public sector retreats from the provision of social services, the more the finance industry steps in to \"help us\" get what we need to get by.Professor and former dean at Milano School of International Affairs, Management, and Urban Policy at The New SchoolSo many young men and women served and sacrificed in Iraq, but that\u0027s not a reason to double down on a failed strategy. I\u0027m glad we\u0027re out of Iraq, we should stay out.Iraq War veteran; former Arizona state representative; candidate for the U.S. Congress representing Arizona\u0027s seventh congressional districtWe cannot allow this madness to progress further than it already has. Having a functional, fit body cannot become the \u0027privilege\u0027 of the upper classes, or of celebrities who can afford personal trainers and daily deliveries of perfectly balanced healthy food.Journalist and author of Gross Misconduct - My Year of Excess in the CityMy father was gone two weeks when a man I didn\u0027t know -- my mother\u0027s new boyfriend -- pushed the butt of a .22 rifle onto my right shoulder and with his big, dirty fingers folded my slender 4-year-old finger onto the triggerWriterIf we continue to advocate for some people being treated as \"less than\" others in any way, how can we claim the Gospel as our mandate with any credibility?Author, editor, speakerA woman\u0027s dress, marital status, and lifestyle do not inspire violence against women. Violence against women exists because the men in their lives -- single, married and strangers -- commit that violence. For the sake of humanity, stop blaming women.Author, \u0027The Wrong Kind of Muslim\u0027At \"press time,\" Gemma is almost 5 years old. I\u0027m writing you this letter because, while I love my daughter with all my heart, and I\u0027m trying really hard to be a great mom, I\u0027m pretty sure I\u0027m doing most things wrong.WriterAmericans think it is illegal for politicians to profit personally from their political office. However, the creation of leadership PACs allows members of Congress to sidestep the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, which bans the use of campaign funds for personal use.Professor of international relations, George Washington UniversityNHL commissioner Gary Bettman is a controversial figure in many circles. That includes not only among fans and segments of the media, but also among some on the playing and officiating sides of the game.Retired NHL Player and NHL Referee, ECAC Director of Hockey Officiating, Chairman KHL Officiating Evaluation and Discipline CommitteesIt may not have solved everything, but dividing Iraq up at least had the best chance for success. It might have allowed what is happening now to have happened in a more organized fashion, with a lot less violence and death. Or, to put it another way, Joe Biden was right.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comScientists estimate that there are over 100,000 intelligent alien civilizations in our galaxy alone--but we\u0027ve never heard anything from any of them. Here are 13 possible explanations for why.www.waitbutwhy.comThis time no one is talking about \"boots on the ground\" -- yet -- but starting with air strikes could easily lead to deeper U.S. involvement once it is clear that bombing is having no effect.Director, Arms and Security Project, Center for International PolicyMarquel expressed a simple truth that exposes why it\u0027s so damaging to see nearly all-white faces year after year on The Bachelorette -- and across much of mainstream pop culture.Senior Editor, HuffPost WomenA closer examination of Singh\u0027s record reveals a combination of both profound failure and accomplishment. Far from being settled, Singh\u0027s legacy is likely to remain the subject of vigorous debate for years to come.Non-Resident Fellow, the Belfer Center\u0027s India and South Asia Program, Harvard UniversityAt its core, legal reasoning is about trying to find insight, or logic, or common sense by comparing different situations and then striving to identify the most important similarities and differences. Analogies open some doors and close others. They shape and direct the analysis.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoIn fact, everything I learned at Princeton Seminary points me away from what I see as the moral laziness of libertarianism, in which I take care of me and nobody else.Associate Professor of Religious Studies, Alma CollegeEven though we can\u0027t always predict natural disasters, we can anticipate their likely aftermaths, including property loss, power or water service disruption, scarcity of food and supplies and overtaxed relief organizations.Vice President, Visa Inc.Kagan is apparently now viewed as a man of decision and literate expositor of necessary action who frontally challenges the U.S. president over the direction of America\u0027s international relations.Author and Fellow at the Century FoundationIf New York State Senate leaders get their way, I may not live to see the Compassionate Care Act -- a bill to create a well regulated medical marijuana program for seriously ill or debilitated New Yorkers -- become law.Cancer patient, medical marijuana advocateThe decline of Spanish Lake isn\u0027t just about white flight, it\u0027s also about de-industrialization and the weakening of organized labor. What happens to neighborhoods built for factory-workers when the factories close?St. Louis-based writer, cab driver, father, crime-fiction authorHis show arrived right at the moment when it seemed like America was coming apart, culturally, spiritually, and politically -- and promised us, in a tone that was relentlessly upbeat yet somehow never smarmy, that we actually could be one nation under a groove, that for three or four hours we could share a common bond.Author, \u0027Tear Down This Myth\u0027We all are acutely aware that Washington is in a serious jam because of the mounting threat to the Baghdad regime amidst signs of military and political unraveling. The United States is reaping the whirlwind from its 12 years of reckless \"War On Terror\" in the Middle East.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghI had no choice but to become an advocate for maternal health. Four years ago, if it were not for the skilled professionals by my side when I developed an amniotic fluid embolism, I would have died.Global maternal and newborn health advocateIt\u0027s a federal crime to communicate a true threat of violence in the United States. Such speech is not protected by the First Amendment\u0027s guarantee of free expression. But what exactly constitutes a true threat of violence in the age of Twitter, YouTube and Facebook?Professor and Brechner Eminent Scholar in Mass Communication, University of Florida in GainesvilleWe hope more employers will join us in making an investment in tomorrow\u0027s workforce by increasing access to a college degree. We need a new approach from leaders who will join us in taking up the mantle to do the right thing: for our companies, for our communities, for our country.CEO of Starbucks Coffee CompanyPresident of Arizona State UniversityWe often use the word unique to describe something special; something that is without equal. But why is it when we use the term \"unique\" to describe a person, the connotation is often negative?Chief Brand Officer, WWEOECD\u0027s report touts the virtues of the EITC as a wage subsidy for low-income workers that both encourages work and reduces poverty. They go on to emphasize an EITC reform that we too have gotten solidly behind.Fmr.
