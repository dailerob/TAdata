{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureFor years, Republicans have used race bait politics to consolidate their support among white, working class voters. For years, they postured about military action for partisan advantage. For years, they have worshipped Reagan as a man on a horse who rode in to save the country. Now Trump\u0027s tropes recycle these themes, in more nationalist, bawdy and bigoted rants. And in indicting our failed trade policies, defending Social Security and Medicare, questioning mindless interventions, he strays from the Republican gospel to appeal to the concerns of working Americans. He\u0027s calling out the phonies and offering himself as a true man on the horse to make America great again. The Republican establishment may just find themselves reaping what they have sown.The failure to implement even the most general or common sense reforms in the light of 800 mass shootings is an absolute refusal to lead on the part of Congress. It\u0027s a flat out disregard for the safety of American citizens. It\u0027s shameful political cowardice.Navy veteran and Co-Director of the Truman National Security Project San Diego ChapterMost agree that the work to reinvent New Orleans remains unfinished. That\u0027s true, especially because post-Katrina New Orleans is trending back toward its old self -- a sluggish regional economy with high inequality and not enough opportunities for its residents. That was certainly not the vision.Co-Director and Senior Fellow, Metropolitan Policy Program at Brookings InstituteApparently we\u0027re going to hear much more about \"illegals\" from the GOP campaign, and among their rote talking points will be how harmful such immigrant are for the U.S. economy and workers. Standing against such nonsense is not only the humane thing to do, however, but the factual thing to say as well.Executive Director, MIT Center for International StudiesOne day, you realize how absurd your current mindset is, that this shit doesn\u0027t matter. You let your demons go, knowing that, perhaps, sharing your story can help some other chubby, goofy, socially-isolated, sensitive kid getting bulled in America who feels like no one in the world cares about him.Former NFL playerFashion Week: for a young woman recovering from anorexia, attending fashion week, surrounded by beautiful people, skinny models, and a society which is centered around appearances, is similar to sending a recovering alcoholic to a bar that serves free drinks all night. Basically, a huge trigger.ViolinistEmphasizing that you are campaigning with the people, not on stage before the people, is what helps build the movement that will continue after the election -- win or lose.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorAs with any crisis, we can expect media coverage to extend across our televisions, computers, and mobile devices. The worry evoked is therefore exponential, and as parents and educators, we must consider the impact on the most impressionable and vulnerable among us--our kids.Professor of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, Executive Director, the Clay Center for Young Healty Minds, Massachusetts General Hospital, clinician, educator and musicianLet\u0027s pretend for a minute that Trump is a serious candidate who really believes the views he espouses on the campaign trail. His xenophobic, racist, unrealistic statements on immigration are getting all the attention, but I think another of his go-to themes is also acting as a major draw for supporters: His argument that he is not beholden to donors.Writer and ProfessorGeorge W. Bush, not Bernie Sanders, is the real \"socialist\" of our generation, primarily because the economy collapsed under his tenure and as a result, the conservative president began an ongoing program of government stimulus into various industries.Columnist published in The Cleveland Plain Dealer, The Baltimore Sun, The Hill, Salon, The Jerusalem Post www.hagoodman.comWhile clicktivism (sometimes called slacktivism) has had its share of critics, the case of Amir Hekmati demonstrates that it can be an effective tool in implementing change.Campaign coordinator, Free Amir campaignWhat you may not know about owning a pit bull is just how much you\u0027ll grow to love these blocky-headed dogs. Owning a pit bull may be habit-forming. You just might own two, or maybe three, or if you\u0027re really lucky, you just might own four. Good things come in multiples sometimes.Photographer, writer, outdoor enthusiast, and devoted canine mom to four rescued pit bulls/pit mixes.Daesh (\"ISIS\") recently destroyed an ancient monastery and a church. This, after abducting several Christians, in what has become the group\u0027s long scourge on humanity. Contrary to ISIS\u0027s ignorance and propaganda, Prophet Muhammad sought to protect the rights of Christians.Visiting Fellow, Harvard University\u0027s Prince Alwaleed bin Talal School of Islamic StudiesYes, I know, and I agree: Motherhood is precious. Babies are miracles. Time goes too fast. The days are long, but the years are short. But here\u0027s what people don\u0027t get: I can enjoy my baby and still wish he would sleep.Blogger at Raves \u0026 Revelations, writer, digital content guru, marketer, social media maven, wife and momWe are the only species known to deny overwhelming evidence -- about the dangers of smoking -- in ways that actually put us in greater danger. The emotional nature of human risk perception can sometimes produce a literally self-destructive irrationality. Non-human animals don\u0027t make such mistakes.Author, \u0027How Risky Is It, Really?\u0027Sanders is unwilling to break with the U.S.-Saudi alliance that has done such damage to both the Arab people and the American people. Now, we have a full-fledged, Israeli-Saudi alliance, and it must be music to the ears of pro-Israeli journalists for Sanders to be calling for U.S. backing of further Saudi domination.Communications director, Institute for Public AccuracyElders ask questions and learn how to build intergenerational movements, even when they do not understand younger generations. Elders build. Old people? They die. They judge and die. I submit that they kill young people in the process.Law student, Writer, and Quan Hitter. #Ferguson Freedom Fighter.Is there any grassroots groundswell calling on Biden to run? I sure can\u0027t hear it. It seems like the biggest fans of a potential Biden run are political journalists looking to cover a more exciting horse race, and some Democratic insiders who look at the same polls I cited and want an establishment insider -- any insider -- to be the alternative to Hillary, rather than Sanders.Entertainment attorney, writer and political activistFor several years now, the most innovative programming on television has come from cable programmers, not broadcasters. Understanding that, Sesame Workshop has made a bold and creative move.Former FCC Chairman, Senior Counsel Sidley AustinThere is no such thing as presumption of innocence if you are a poor, black Brazilian who wants to go to the beach in a part of the city \"where you are not supposed to be.\"Senior News Reporter at Brasil PostIf our legislators and Governor really support fair pay for women, as 90 percent of the voters think they should, supporting Senate Bill 3 is the right thing to do.Executive Director of Equal Rights AdvocatesClinton\u0027s position on church-state separation is inconsistent. While she was a strong advocate for secular education, she\u0027s also supported religiously backed discrimination in the past and is close to a number of Religious Right leaders. It\u0027s difficult to predict how she would handle these issue once in office.Executive Director, American Humanist AssociationI know you can do this. It might take a while for you to figure out the new classroom and the new expectations of kindergarten, but you\u0027ve got this.Blogger at Everything and Nothing from Essex- deannajsmith.comIn his statements and actions, Pope Francis reveals a commitment to emulate the earthly ministry of Jesus. This is particularly clear in the Pope\u0027s focus not only on the condition of humanity\u0027s inner selves, but even more so on the conditions in which so much of humanity lives.Associate Professor of Theology at Earlham School of ReligionFounder and president, Rainbow/PUSH CoalitionIn working with teens, we have to be nuanced in our thinking, open to different approaches and aware of broader social realities. But students are approached as though all drug use is the same and as though we don\u0027t each have a story of our own to tell.Intern, Drug Policy AllianceThe first solution is to take the carbon dioxide out of the stack gases of (mostly) coal-fired power plants, or if not there, then directly from the air. Both solutions are expensive and would add a cost to the price of electricity -- but both are, from a technological perspective, doable.Scientist and author who works on energy, climate and how humans have influenced our planet.When we get caught up in the need to respond and stay plugged in at all times, we are operating out of fear, which isn\u0027t helpful in any kind of communication -- business or personal. A few tips to shift your relationship with your inbox -- and the people you\u0027re emailing:Creative Wellness Coach \u0026 CheerleaderFar too many lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or questioning youth who encounter the juvenile justice system are placed in facilities that fail to address past experiences of trauma or where they are at risk for sexual violence.Research Associate for LGBT Progress at the Center for American ProgressTo be 100 percent honest, when we\u0027re away from you, we don\u0027t miss you that much. We might say it, but in reality, we like our man cave time. We don\u0027t have to listen to your stories about the drama at work. We don\u0027t have to pretend that we\u0027re interested in your annoying friend Amanda.Dating and relationship coach, authorWhile many of us who call the city home have become blasé about shelling out $10 for a coffee and a muffin, we realize that visitors may suffer from sticker shock. Fortunately, there are plenty of opportunities to take advantage of free tours, outdoor activities, and cultural attractions.TravelandLeisure.comFilmmaker + painter + musician + photographer - working on two new contradicting films simultaneously: Circuit Board Species and California on Fire.Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
