{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"A rolling stone gathers no moss, and this week a loose-tongued General got steamrolled by a paper one. President Obama did the right thing in canning McChrystal. But his appointment of David Petraeus bodes very badly for the July 2011 withdrawal start date. Last week, Petraeus hinted as much, telling Congress he would recommend delaying the withdrawal if conditions in Afghanistan didn\u0027t improve (and is there anyone left who thinks they will?). Petraeus Ex Machina got the president\u0027s backing: \"We didn\u0027t say we\u0027d be switching off the lights and closing the door behind us,\" the commander-in-chief told the nation. Something tells me that Obama - McChrystal + Petraeus \u003d upping the ante in Afghanistan.

It amounts to an assertion of command: the very thing that was aborted by the general\u0027s comments and the vulgar contempt for civilian authority he countenanced and seems to have fomented among his staff. But to assert command brings responsibilities; thus far in his presidency, Barack Obama has shown a relish mostly for the sound and posture of command.Read Post | CommentsMaria Shriver, 06.25.2010Emmy-winning journalist, best-selling author and first lady of the State of CaliforniaThink about what our re-commitment to the arts would mean - not just to our children - but to our economy.
