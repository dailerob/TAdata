{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Author, research psychologist and gender scholarSome who have become radicalized may be motivated by their own experiences with discrimination or unjust treatment. Others may join out of fear, and the promise that aligning with ISIS will keep them safer now and, perhaps, in the afterlife. Still others may experience disenchantment with Western ideals or have been disappointed by Western promises of freedom, employment, or financial stability. Through social media, ISIS has also engaged many younger Westerners who feel isolated and angry, and are seeking an outlet in which to rebel. But there\u0027s also another explanation that\u0027s been talked about less, and that\u0027s mental illness. The idea that radicalization may be a mental health disorder, or at the very least linked to one, is just beginning to be examined.Climate change is not the only crisis we face. We also face a crisis of joblessness. Of inequality. Of racial and gender injustice. So when we talk about climate solutions in this context, it has to be about designing and then fighting for integrated solutions, ones that radically bring down emissions while simultaneously building more just economies and democracies based on true equality.Author, This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. The ClimateChoosing to invest in others when everyone and everything is telling you to continue investing in yourself and your career shows strength of character and a willingness to live your principles. Why can\u0027t we learn to evaluate the success of a life, or even of a career, as a blend of money and meaning, of both climbing a ladder of accomplishment and building a web of relationships? We can, of course.President and CEO, New America; Author, Unfinished Business: Women, Men, Work, FamilyThe double standard can\u0027t be more jarring: For days television networks and media outlets have been parroting the FBI in telling us how the San Bernadino shooters were \"radicalized\" at this or that time, or speculating on their \"radicalization\" and how it occurred.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostMuch of the discussion about health in recent years has focused on new medications and technologies, expanded insurance coverage, and improved quality of care. What also demands attention is a fundamental building block of health that millions of Americans are lacking: food.Surgeon General of the United StatesThis is real and personal. It is close to my heart and makes me, as a proud American and a valuable contributor to my society, feel personally victimized. It makes me sad and hurt and anxious.Sophomore majoring in Human Development at UC San DiegoAnd we all ask ourselves: How could this keep happening again and again? Knowing that this cannot be normal? Or: Is this really who we have become? I ask these questions not just as a White House official who has attended far too many memorial services during the last seven years, but also, sadly, as a granddaughter with first-hand experience.Senior Advisor to the President and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsMany see student debt as a young person\u0027s problem, but it affects all generations. People ages 65 and older owe $18.2 billion on student loans. People ages 75 and older owe around $2 billion on outstanding student loans. As the population ages, the amounts owed by those age groups are increasing rapidly.Founding Co-director, Social Security WorksContrary to Prime Minister Netanyahu\u0027s assertion, the occupation erodes rather than buttresses Israel\u0027s national security and cannot be justified on either security or moral grounds.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUI am the greatest threat to ISIS and all Islamic terrorists world wide.

He has no vision. He doesn\u0027t even have a cohesive political brand, to use his favorite word. That makes him a charlatan.Former producer, \u0027The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\u0027The Venezuelan political system, with all its flaws, is much more democratic than the conventional wisdom has maintained. Now, what about the future? Opposition leaders will still face the same choice they have faced for the past 16 years: Do they want to participate in the political system, or simply vanquish their enemies (the Chavistas)?Co-director, Center for Economic and Policy Research, Washington, D.C.The holiday season is a busy time of the year for identity thieves and other kinds of identity-related fraudsters. Scams abound, but if you follow a few simple rules, you can sidestep some avoidable holiday blues.Author of Swiped. Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and IDT911As the deadline for a deal approaches, transparency and verification of progress are not the only unresolved issues. There still are the perennial questions of how much money richer nations will provide to poorer nations as they attempt to solve poverty and develop their economies with clean energy.Executive Director, Presidential Climate Action ProjectTo be Muslim today is to live an apologetic life as a scapegoat for the radicalized. The underlying basis of ideologies and motives behind terrorism is hidden and, in turn, Islam continues to be misrepresented as an aggressive religion.Student, Bard CollegeMy daddy died in January 2013, and one of the last things we talked about was the Chicago police. He was an optimistic man with a fierce passion for social justice, but after a protracted debate with an ultra-idealistic me, he shouted, \"Marilyn, don\u0027t you know that the police is the biggest gang in the city?\"Teacher in district and charter schools in Chicago since 2004, blogger at Education Post. Journalist, wife, mother and founder of Teachers Who Pray.I\u0027ve always pretended to be American. I pretend because it is feels great to be \"exceptional\" and more civilized than the rest of the world. I pretend because it makes me feel safer to fear others who are different. I pretend because American Republican politicians aren\u0027t afraid to demonstrate their overt bigotry by generalizing an entire group of people. Now, it\u0027s time to finally stop pretending and fulfill my true destiny.writer, activist and political commentatorI want women\u0027s bodies to be seen as human bodies.Writer. Sports lover. Whiskey drinker. Mom.The Korean War ended more than 62 years ago, but not really. The warring parties only agreed to an armistice. Technically everyone still is at war.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteIf you wish political talk radio felt as hot today as it did 15 or 20 years ago, take some consolation in the Donald Trump campaign. It\u0027s pretty much the same thing.Writer, Bob Dylan fan, memorized every line in \u0027Casablanca\u0027Beyond the bigoted speech and the violent readiness to kill, the worst aspect of all of this is that the compass guiding these statements and much of the sentiment that I hear coming from many Christians is not Love -- but rather it is fear.University Chaplain, University of PennsylvaniaThin was in, so chubby at six, I was put on a diet. Diets were also in. In fact, perhaps a peculiar corollary to the sexual revolution, was the mass diet industry. Women were dieting. Mothers were dieting. So for the first time, it was conceivable that little girls could diet along, too.Writer, author of \"Fat Kids: Truth and Consequences\" and \"Fat Sex: The Naked Truth\"It is natural to want to be surrounded by positive people.

In Paris, negotiators are trying to come to agreement on a global climate treaty, and a lot is on the line -- especially for women.President, International Women\u0027s Health CoalitionAmong those calling out Trump on his opportunistic xenophobia are, thankfully, numerous faith leaders. One faith leader who didn\u0027t join his peers is Franklin Graham. He didn\u0027t remain silent, mind you, but doubled down, boasting that he beat Trump to the punch.Professor, writerThis may seem like the most obvious advice you\u0027ve ever read. But for some strange reason, a lot of beginners believe that everything revolves around the equipment they have. Nothing is further from the truth.PhotographerIn the America of haves and have-nots, fewer folks are \"movin\u0027 on up\" like George Jefferson of the classic sitcom.
