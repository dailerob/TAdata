{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonOur need to redefine success is as urgent on the collective level as it is in our personal lives. Limiting our metrics of success to money and power (and in Washington, especially power), and completely defining ourselves by our jobs, creates a political class obsessed with short-term gain -- one that\u0027s not up to the types of long-term challenges we\u0027re now facing. And given the scale of those challenges, it\u0027s not too much to say that we\u0027re in a state of crisis -- a crisis of leadership.Pleading guilty to criminal charges is proving so harsh and damaging to Credit Suisse that its stock price is only up 1 percent Tuesday morning. Must be nice to be too big to truly prosecute. The Swiss bank pleaded guilty Monday evening to conspiring to help U.S. customers evade taxes, the first such guilty plea by a major financial institution in years. Not long ago, prosecutors, regulators, banks and shareholders all feared that having a major bank like Credit Suisse plead guilty could have catastrophic consequences for the bank and the global economy. Now they know better -- everything will be just fine.Mark GongloffChief financial writer, The Huffington PostLove your self, love your work, love the people around you. Dare to love those who are different from you, no matter where they\u0027re from, what they look like, and who they love. Pursue this life of love with focus and passion and ambition and courage. Give it your all. And that will be your path to true success.John LegendRecording artist, concert performer and philanthropistFeminism is an endeavor to change something very old, widespread, and deeply rooted in many, perhaps most, cultures around the world, innumerable institutions, and most households on Earth -- and in our minds, where it all begins and ends.Rebecca SolnitAuthor, \u0027A Paradise Built in Hell\u0027The arts are not the whole solution for education in the 21st century. We need strong leadership, effective teachers and hard work on many fronts. But arts education gives our schools effective tools to reach and teach students.Kerry WashingtonActressIt is hard to imagine that most parents, even in conservative states, are comfortable dining next to a group of people toting large weapons. By distributing photos that show just what that looks like, Moms Demand Action has hit on an effective strategy.Ben HallmanSenior Financial Writer, The Huffington PostThe GOP\u0027s recent efforts to gin up presidential scandals in punitive hearings, media lynchings, and weekly calls for impeachment, evince a party-wide pathology that puts partisanship over patriotism.Robert F. Kennedy Jr.President, Waterkeeper Alliance; Senior Attorney, NRDCHow do we learn what it means to really fall in love? More simply put, who teaches us how to actually date?Jen GlantzAuthor (All My Friends are Engaged) \u0026 Blogger (The Things I Learned From)If we want to help veterans transition successfully -- to become as productive in civilian life as they were overseas -- then we need to change how we talk about mental injuries sustained in combat.Justin ConstantineInspirational Speaker, Wounded Warrior Project Board of Directors, Advisor to US Chamber of CommerceWhether one is bound to a wheelchair, suffers from ADHD, or repeats the first syllable of a word as I do, we have been tacitly, yet resoundingly told to doubt both ourselves and our abilities. Doubt, as has been observed, kills more dreams than failure ever will.Parker MantellGraduate of Indiana UniversityThe wrong question is being asked. It is not, can faith exist with science? It is rather, can enchantment be restored in the age of enlightenment?Gary HartUnited States Senator (Ret.)Banks and equity funds that invest in charter schools in underserved areas can take advantage of a very generous tax credit, which they can combine with other tax breaks while they also collect interest on any money they lend out. Doing this, they can double their money in seven years.Alan SingerSocial studies educator, Hofstra UniversityMany of society\u0027s favorite psychoactive compounds, both legal and illegal, work by hijacking our own neurotransmitters and brain receptor sites. In other words, they aren\u0027t creating something out of nothing -- they only work because our brains are set up to get high and feel pleasure.Mark SissonFormer elite marathoner and triathlete; Author, \u0027The Primal Blueprint\u0027You know the feeling. When it hurts to see other people succeed. When you read articles about Mark Zuckerberg, the world\u0027s youngest billionaire. When you watch some freak child prodigy playing piano like a mini Mozart. When your friend gets that thing you wanted for yourself.Karen X. ChengCo-founder of Giveit100I mean, you can\u0027t walk in and take a book off the shelf and put it in your jacket and walk out -- but there\u0027s no law that says you can\u0027t walk into the store with a book in your jacket and put it on the shelf, is there? Nah. It was a genius strategy, I thought, congratulating myself.Brendan LeonardOutdoorsman and author of \u0027The New American Road Trip Mixtape\u0027Conversations about trigger warnings seem more and more like superficial proxies for ones about deeper problems on campuses regarding diversity, equity, the corporatization of education, and, the dreaded word, privilege.Soraya ChemalyFeminist, Writer, Satirist... not always in that orderNo single person or entity has the expertise, resources or reach to effectively address global challenges alone. Instead, it will take a collaborative effort among the public, private and nonprofit sectors to move forward.Anne FinucaneChief Global Strategy and Marketing Officer at Bank of AmericaPresident Obama has only one option -- use every ounce of his authority to unilaterally improve economic security. He is more than willing to work with congressional Republicans, but he is certainly not going to wait for them.Dan PfeifferSenior Advisor to President ObamaBeauty abounds in the most unexpected places, making the minor and mundane suddenly magnificent. The trick is to include yourself in this expanded version of beauty.Lisa SadikmanWriter, tween whisperer, toddler wrangler.A coalition of black pastors filed an amicus brief in Michigan\u0027s gay marriage trial last Wednesday. The group hope to defeat efforts to make same-sex marriage legal in Michigan and in the brief they particularly rejected comparisons between the gay civil rights movement and the struggle for African Americans in this country.Paul Brandeis RaushenbushExecutive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostMr. Ray made me think critically about the future for the first time, and he did it by showing me what I could become.Josh Misner, Ph.D.Award-winning communication and leadership professor and mindfulness researcherWhat are the new norms, if any?

But if you listen carefully to the conversations, the main concern is not about the standards, themselves, but about the consequences of high-stakes tests attached to the standards. And those concerns are well-placed.Linda Darling-HammondRandi WeingartenEventually, your loving husband, whom you had specifically banned from taking breastfeeding pictures, the one you had forced to delete any pictures that showed any area of your breasts, sends you this amazing photo.Sandy RoffeyWriter, mother, former educator, milk addict enabler.The truth is that pro-gun activists don\u0027t want any laws or regulations on firearms, regardless of the intent of the law.Mike WeisserMike the Gun GuyIt is still so new that we, as women, have a strong voice.

We watched him kiss his boyfriend. We even retweeted his message.Yogi RothAthlete Ally Ambassador, New York Times best-selling author, Emmy-nominated filmmakerThe claim that dozens of men at Guantanamo cannot be tried in the United States and are also too dangerous to release to another country is just not plausible. It\u0027s a claim we wouldn\u0027t accept from any other country, and we shouldn\u0027t get comfortable with it in the United States, either.Daphne EviatarSenior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstAs a result of their aggressive recruiting and their low investment in actual education, for-profit schools saw more than half of the students enrolled in 2008 leave within a median of four months, without a degree or certification, just troublesome debt.Kevin M. RyanPresident and CEO, Covenant HouseSociologists say that unless you\u0027re a tech aficionado, it\u0027s hard to care about government spying that doesn\u0027t affect your daily life. For most white, middle-class people, data gathering seems abstract. We can\u0027t see it happen and the only manifestation is a targeted ad on our Gmail that we might dismiss with a \"well, that\u0027s creepy.\" For poor people, surveillance is an everyday reality.Angelina ChapinBlogs Editor, Huffington Post CanadaGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"EARTH HITS HEAT RECORD IN APRIL",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
