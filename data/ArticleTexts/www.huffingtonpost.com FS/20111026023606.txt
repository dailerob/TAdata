{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"I was in Spain on October 15th when half a million took to the streets of Madrid to voice their frustration with a political system that has failed the people of Spain -- in the same way our own \"Los Indignados\" (Spanish for \"The Outraged\") are voicing their anger and frustration at a system that has failed the \"99 percent\" here in America. I was struck by how family-oriented the protests were. But when I looked at how the media covered them, instead of the thousands of families and children and retirees who marched in towns all across Spain, what dominated the airwaves were burning cars from the protest in Rome -- which was hijacked by a coterie of masked anarchists. Just as solutions to the problems facing Europe and America are not going to be found in traditional political ways, the truth of what\u0027s happening is not going to be found in traditional media coverage either.Read Post | Comments (311)Norman Lear, 10/25/11Founder, People for the American WayI am haunted by something I saw on my TV set this morning.
