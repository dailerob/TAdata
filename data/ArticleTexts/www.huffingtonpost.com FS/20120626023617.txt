Otherwise, actions taken in any one area would be quickly undermined by lack of progress elsewhere. Success here speaks to much more than whether it is Obama or Romney who wins the November presidential elections. It also relates to whether our political system as a whole can regain over time the ability to agree on a common economic vision, and to pursue it with the proper sense of shared responsibility, adequate seriousness and focused implementation. Anything short of this would entail something that America is yet to experience in its proud history: the highly unsettling prospect that our our children\u0027s generation may end up worse off than ours. We should certainly not go there.Read Post | Comments (15)Keli Goff, 06/25/12Author, Commentator and Contributing Editor, TheLoop21.comYet again, a powerful, influential woman had a platform to talk about the issue of choice when it comes to women, parenthood and power and chose not to discuss one of the most undervalued choices of all: the choice not to become a parent.Read Post | Comments (310)Cenk Uygur, 06/25/12Host, \u0027The Young Turks\u0027President Obama thought compromise, conciliation and agreement with Republicans was the correct path in his first term.
