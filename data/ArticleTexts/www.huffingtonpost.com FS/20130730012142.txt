{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonI\u0027m in London for the first international edition of our Third Metric conference, discussing a more sustainable definition of success that includes well-being, wisdom, and our ability to wonder and to give back. Why are we taking the conversation international? Because, while creation of the faulty definition of success definitely had significant help from the U.S., it\u0027s clear this is now a global phenomenon. That\u0027s why we\u0027ll be holding more events like the one today -- so people can connect, learn from each other, exchange ideas and truly begin to ingrain healthier habits and restructure the way we live our daily lives. Our unsustainable definition of success is a global problem, and it\u0027s going to require a global response. I hope you\u0027ll join the conversation and tell us how you\u0027re redefining success in your own life and in your part of the world.CommentsZack ExleyVenture AnachronistIf people like Peter Buffett and other major philanthropic and business leaders took seriously the unglamorous truths about ending poverty, and spoke out about them, it would create the conditions for not just a new story, but a new political movement that would transform the world.Comments (295)Jason WhitlockColumnist, FOXSports.comThe uniqueness of the black American experience and the side effects of that experience are not difficult to relate to, convey or understand. It\u0027s just that most pundits and broadcasters are far too lazy, scared and convinced of viewer ignorance to go beyond simple-minded, attention-grabbing sound bites.Comments (260)Shelley EmlingEditor, Post 50Last week I did something I\u0027ve never done before: I went a full 11 days without checking my email or phone. And you\u0027ll never guess what happened.Comments (128)Paul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostIf more Christians can speak out the way Pope Francis and Archbishop Tutu have this week and so many have been in recent memory -- it will change the way people view Jesus and the faith that he inspires in so many of us.Comments (493)Eugene JareckiAward-winning dramatic and documentary filmmakerToday, we must poignantly modify Eugene Debs\u0027 refrain, \"while there is a soul in prison who would sooner take his life than cave to the harrowing oppression of a predatory system, I am a participating in that system with my silence and with my next meal eaten as a free man.\"Comments (16)Frances BeineckePresident, Natural Resources Defense CouncilAmerica has a choice to make. We can stand by and watch energy companies industrialize our beloved landscapes. Or we can create smart safeguards that hold companies accountable for pollution and put sensitive places off limits.Comments (125)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkIt\u0027s simply amazing how many on the right who never cared about \u0027Black issues,\u0027 or the fact that our youth are facing unequal access to education, jobs, housing and higher rates of incarceration, now suddenly want to act as if they are so concerned about what\u0027s going on with us.Comments (45)Ali SmithArtist, AuthorWhen you enter the health care system as a 38-year-old pregnant woman, you suddenly discover you\u0027re a bit of a problem. They\u0027ve coined a rather insulting phrase for you and you hear it ad nauseum. You are a lady of \"advanced maternal age,\" a term definitely not thought up by a woman.Comments (50)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorI didn\u0027t hear Treasury Secretary Jack Lew on TV yesterday, but I read this morning that he was asked \"how come the Obama administration bailed out the banks but isn\u0027t talking about doing so for Detroit?\"Comments (215)Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoHow do we know when to abandon a successful policy? At first blush, this might seem a contradiction in terms. Why would one ever abandon a successful policy? But most policies have costs as well as benefits, and at a certain point one might decide that the costs outweigh benefits.Comments (160)John PavleyCTO @ The Huffington Post, BloggerBy the time I started learning to code, as a hobby, I was well into my twenties. I believe my computer science education started much earlier.Comments (97)Kader A. AbderrahimDirecteur éditorial , Al Huffington Post MaghrebBoth countries are now weakened by violence. Another path is possible. Taking it requires the willingness of politicians, especially those who are governing, to open the dialogue and create a broad consensus. This is the only choice; the other leads to the abyss.Comments (31)Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027A week ago, a carefully orchestrated series of leaks signaled that President Obama was on the verge of naming Larry Summers to succeed Ben Bernanke as chair of the Federal Reserve. Now, a massive backlash from Senate Democrats makes Summers\u0027 appointment something of a long shot.Comments (266)Michael SmerconishSiriusXM Radio HostThe O.J. Simpson criminal prosecution was doomed from the moment the trial was moved to downtown Los Angeles, ensuring that the jury looked nothing like the two victims. Might the outcome of the Zimmerman trial have been similarly predetermined -- because of gender?Comments (202)Peter ReilingExecutive Director, Henry Crown Fellowship Program \u0026 Executive Vice President for Leadership and Seminar Programs, Aspen Institute.This summer we are taking this idea to a new level with a major new annual event, the \"Aspen Leaders Action Forum\" taking place July 29-August 1. Its goal: to assemble some of world\u0027s most entrepreneurial leaders and inspire them to step up, to move from \"ideas to action\" and to take on some of society\u0027s greatest problems.CommentsAngelina ChapinBlogs Editor, Huffington Post CanadaAfter a week consumed with New York mayoral hopeful Anthony Weiner\u0027s wiener pics, the relationship between male power and sex has once again been thrust into the spotlight. And it seems these scandals always centre around men and their wieners. Where are all the women, drunk off authority (and maybe a little wine) snapping vagina pics for young college students?Comments (93)Ahmed Salah and Alex MayyasiJanuary 25, 2011 was not a normal day. Around 4 p.m. I gazed up at the iconic pink stone of the museum as I approached Tahrir -- with 6,000 other Egyptians marching all around me. When we entered the square, we realized we were entering a battlefield.CommentsCarole TravisAttorney, activist, former president of United Auto Workers Local 719Today marks the first day of the 4th week of the California Prison Hunger Strike. On July 8 when the prisoners began their hunger strike to call attention to this torture, 30,000 inmates across California stopped eating.Comments (57)Sen. Rand PaulU.S. Senator from KentuckyAll children, no matter who they are or where they live, deserve an equal chance to develop their skills and intellect. But today in America, too many kids don\u0027t get that chance.Comments (813)Tom EngelhardtEditor, TomDispatch.comThere are two men, both of whom, Washington is convinced, must be brought in: one to face \"justice,\" one to escape it. And all of this is a given, nothing that needs to be explained or justified to anyone anywhere.Comments (21)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesAs Russia moves in a very dark direction, a line must be drawn in the sand. American companies and politicians who court LGBT people are going to have stand against this brutal regime in no uncertain terms. And it must be expressed in actions, not just words.Comments (152)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarShould there be more women in the senior ranks of organizations? Should men support that quest by fitting easily into -- and feeling respect in -- the role of caregiver? Should the numbers of opportunity reflect the gender makeup of the group. Yes.Comments (303)Bryan MaygersDeputy Blog Editor, Huffington PostWith the U.S. using an almost completely different roster from the first-choice team that won three straight World Cup qualifiers in June, the Gold Cup served as an extended audition for many players looking to work their way into the squad going to Brazil next summer.CommentsRichard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureIt\u0027s a real-life disaster movie, one that\u0027s left neighborhoods in ruins all across the country, killed thousands of people, and ruined millions of lives. You might call it a \"Banknado.\"Comments (171)James ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Reviewing events unfolding from Iraq in the East to Lebanon in the West can give one the distinct feeling that the region is on a path leading to self-destruction. What, if anything, can be done to reverse course?Comments (325)Leo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersRepublicans lost the White House. They lost an opportunity to control the Senate. They lost seats in the House, though they remain the majority there. Yet it is their plan, from that minority position, to sustain their sink-middle-class-boats economic policies and scuttle all attempts to change course.Comments (187)Peter DreierE.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeWalmart invites big-name celebrities not only to entertain the shareholders but also to lend legitimacy to the company. By appearing at these annual events, the celebrities appear to be endorsing Walmart\u0027s business practices.Comments (11)Tiffany GuarnacciaCommunications and Public Relations professional. Founder of Kite Hill PR.The flexible group environment created by co-working is helping to transform and improve the startup experience by creating a feeling of interaction and increased productivity.CommentsAmy L. FreemanDevelopment Director at Bethesda CaresLike most of us, I want to help people in distress. With panhandlers, though, I never knew whether the person was truly in need. I worried that my money would fuel some addiction, rather than funding food or shelter. I worried that I was being scammed. Was I right?Comments (221)Raymond J. LearsyAuthor, \u0027Ruminations on the Distortion of Oil Prices and Crony Capitalism\u0027Quite dramatically, being the biggest bull in the China shop, JPMorgan Chase made the striking announcement this past week that it would quit trading in physical commodities.Comments (20)Lisa Mirza Grotts, 2013.29.07Dean Baker, 2013.29.07Chris Weigant, 2013.29.07Shannah L.
