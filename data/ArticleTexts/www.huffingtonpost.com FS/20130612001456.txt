{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoIn my judgment, based on what I know from the media thus far, Snowden is neither a hero nor a traitor, but he is most certainly a criminal who deserves serious punishment. What should he have done? Probably, he should have presented his concerns to senior, responsible members of Congress. But the one thing he most certainly should not have done is to decide on the basis of his own ill-informed, arrogant and amateurish judgment that he knows better than everyone else in government how best to serve the national interest. The rule of law matters, and no one gave Edward Snowden the authority to make that decision for the nation. His conduct was more than unacceptable; it was criminal.Comments (1,684)Ann BrenoffSenior Writer, The Huffington PostIf you want to be hired by the insanely awesome company, you need to be confident about your place in it. But be yourself. If they wanted another 20-something hipster for the job, you wouldn\u0027t be sitting in the room with the interviewer.Comments (167)Jedediah PurdyProfessor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027Because North Carolina refused the Obamacare Medicaid expansion, I ended up in handcuffs. That was my trigger, anyway. Statistically, next year more than two thousand people in the state will die who would have lived if NC had accepted federal money to give health insurance to low-income families.Comments (531)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The irony is we already have a national economic strategy but it\u0027s been dictated largely by powerful global corporations and Wall Street. If we had a strategy designed to increase jobs and wages, what would it look like?Comments (174)Ricky GervaisActor, writer, comedian, director, producerNever grow up. If you\u0027re writing or directing, give yourself enough time to play. Play the fool. Goad. Shock. Laugh. Trip over something that isn\u0027t there. Try something. And never be afraid to fail. That failure is useful too. It\u0027s just another building block.Comments (90)Andrew ZimbalistRobert A. Woods Professor of Economics, Smith CollegePoliticians\u0027 egos, buoyed by the private economic interests that stand to profit and the frenzied international competition for hosting the Olympics, drive the bid. It leads to untethered grandiosity. Putin\u0027s pet project in Sochi seems to be a case in point.CommentsRalph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorDisturbingly, those of us who saw the warning signs are routinely ignored or even chastised, while the blatant war mongers, the misleaders, the defrauders and the corporate apologists are given ample time and space to promote their wrongheaded views.Comments (47)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkWe never rendered our own verdict; we instead urged authorities to follow proper protocol and have Zimmerman arrested, an investigation put into place and a court of law to decide. This week, nearly a year and a half since Trayvon\u0027s death, that day has finally arrived.Comments (467)Lisa ArendsAuthor, wellness coach, and math teacherFourteen years ago, I was preparing to marry you. I was so excited but, even more, I was so sure. Sure that we were so good together. Sure that we would continue to weather any storm. Sure that we would be together forever.Comments (313)Cecile RichardsPresident of Planned Parenthood Federation of America and Planned Parenthood Action FundHopefully, with this decision, women all over the country will soon be able to walk into a pharmacy and pick up emergency contraception off the shelves, as soon as they need it -- no barriers, no shame.Comments (25)Kristin MeekhofWriterI\u0027m choking back tears, searching for words. I\u0027m actually speechless. Impulsively, I blurt this out, \"What do you mean?\"Comments (67)Jon SoltzCo-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranAt a time when the budget is stretched to the breaking point because of poor decisions like the sequester, choices need to be made. If the choice is between taking care of our troops and veterans or protecting Europe from a ghost, it should be an easy choice to make.Comments (55)Amy J. SennettLitigation associate, Washington, D.C. law firmImpact -- a third metric beyond money and power -- is so important for women and men. And it does not have to mean working for non-profit, charitable causes. Impact can mean designing a time-saving app for smartphone users.CommentsAnna LappeProject Director, Food MythBusters and author of \"Diet for a Hot Planet: The Climate Crisis at the End of Your Fork\"While biotech proponents love to talk about the promise of drought-resistant, nitrogen-efficient, and nutritionally enhanced varieties, to date, commercialized genetically engineered crop varieties have been mostly limited to two types: those developed to resist a proprietary herbicide, and those engineered to produce a specific insecticide.Comments (79)Chase MadarLawyer, writerThe prosecution of Bradley Manning, WikiLeaks\u0027 source inside the U.S. Army, will be pulling out all the stops when it calls to the stand a member of Navy SEAL Team 6, the unit that assassinated Osama bin Laden.Comments (154)Erik NielsonAssistant Professor of Liberal Arts, University of RichmondThere was something remarkable about seeing rappers pledge their support to a mainstream presidential candidate, especially given the history of antipathy between national politicians and hip hop.CommentsMark SissonFormer elite marathoner and triathlete, author of the best-selling health and fitness book, The Primal Blueprint.As much as we focus on food and fitness as the \"physical\" arbiters of health and longevity, there appears to be much more to it. In fact, most research fails to find any grand commonalities in the diet and fitness patterns of the longest lived.Comments (13)Bruce LubinAuthor, Who Knew?Here\u0027s a terrific tip to use during warm weather: Turn off your dishwasher after the rinse cycle, open it up, and let your dishes drip-dry. You\u0027ll save a lot by avoiding the heat-drying cycle on your machine.Comments (538)MeiMei FoxNew York Times bestselling author, speaker, life coachWhat I found so fascinating about my own experience coping with extreme stress was that I had to heal both mind and body--through yoga, meditation, and dietary changes.CommentsJordan SchultzThe Huffington Post\u0027s sports columnist, The Schultz ReportThe strange and rare reality of Tebow -- whom the New York Jets quite literally could not give away -- is that the media love to cover him, to criticize him, but perhaps most importantly, to try to make sense of him.Comments (16)Jenny IsenmanHumor columnist, Jen X\u0027pert, Jenny From the Blog at TheSuburbanJungle.comAh, \"Momisms\"; those phrases we turn to get a short reprieve, to conceal criticism, to maintain our sanity or simply because we have no clue what our child just said and we\u0027re trying to go with it.CommentsJames Cameron and Susan K. AveryWe explored outward to the moon and outer space at the end of the 20th century, but we entered the 21st century managing to overlook this continent-size frontier right on our own planet.CommentsLeonard SteinhornAuthor and Professor of Communication at American UniversityAs with so much journalism about baby boomers, the Washington Post\u0027s front page story, \"Why the sharp rise in suicides by boomers?\" is not only misleading but built on a flaccid foundation of inaccurate history, bubblegum sociology, and generational stereotyping.CommentsJoe PeyronninHofstra Journalism ProfessorThe revelations that the U.S. government has been collecting phone and Internet data has reopened a debate about the balance between privacy and security, at a time when America is becoming an increasing target of terrorists.CommentsStephen SchlesingerAuthor and Fellow at the Century FoundationWhether the surveillance program is the correct response to possible terrorism is still up for debate. But politically, Obama had no choice.CommentsMark R. KennedyProfessor of political management and director of the Graduate School of Political Management, George Washington UniversityCan lightning strike twice in one place? Not according to folklore, but when did Massachusetts ever comply with convention? When it comes to special elections in the Bay State, anything is possible.CommentsChristine OrganAuthor; Freelance Writer; BloggerSuccess is not a victory or result, but a perpetual state of mind. It is learning from external paradigms of accomplishment while listening to a compassionate inner voice.CommentsRobert ScheerEditor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027The folks at Booz Allen, and its parent company the Carlyle Group, love that world as a fabulous profit center, and it is truly inspiring that there are still folks like Edward Snowden whom they can\u0027t buy.Comments (91)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesEven in this time when some pundits claim gays have arrived, our supposed friends are still throwing us overboard, subjecting us to ongoing discrimination. Here\u0027s hoping that, even if John Roberts isn\u0027t among them, five justices of the Supreme Court get that.Comments (51)Leighton WoodhouseCo-founder, DogParkMedia.com\"We shouldn\u0027t be surprised that a government establishment that is not being held accountable or in check by any other institution, that is Byzantine in size, structure and purpose, and that receives 25 percent of all government funding is overreaching.\"Comments (18)Ozan VarolAssistant Professor of Law at Lewis \u0026 Clark Law SchoolHistory has prominent examples that demonstrate the power of non-violent resistance against government repression. The Turks are in the process of crafting a story that exemplifies how the power of humor and innovation can be effectively harnessed against repression and abuse.CommentsDavid Finkle, 2013.11.06Brad Johnson, 2013.11.06Trey Ellis, 2013.11.06Lia Petridis Maiello, 2013.11.06Edward Goldman, 2013.11.06Emily J.
