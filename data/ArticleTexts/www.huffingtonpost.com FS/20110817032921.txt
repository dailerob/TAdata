{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"What the country needs right now is a good hedgehog. Back in 1953, British philosopher Isaiah Berlin famously laid out two opposing styles of leadership -- hedgehogs and foxes -- taking his cue from a line in an ancient Greek poem by Archilochus: \"The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.\" According to Berlin, the fox will \"pursue many ends, often unrelated and even contradictory, connected, if at all, only in some de facto way.\" In contrast, the hedgehog offers an \"unchanging, all embracing... unitary inner vision.\" Right now, with the country in crisis mode, the American people sense that our problems can\u0027t be solved by foxy spinning, triangulating, slicing and dicing, and tinkering at the edges. They are longing for a hedgehog at the helm -- even a fanatical, delusional hedgehog like those currently leading the Republican Party.Read Post | CommentsJason Linkins and Tyler Kingkade, 8/16/11Ron Paul wanted Congress to have the power to audit the Federal Reserve. Rick Perry has gone after the Fed. One man is clearly the pale imitation of the other, and it\u0027s the pale imitation who\u0027s getting all the coverage. That sound like good journalism to you?Read Post | CommentsSen. Harry Reid, 8/16/11Senate Majority LeaderWhen I was a kid, I thought I was a lot tougher than I was.

While none of these developments involved him directly, all three collectively were a victory for Mitt Romney.Read Post | CommentsWill Bunch, 8/16/11Author, \u0027The Backlash\u0027As Perry surges to the head of the GOP pack, it\u0027s important to see how the governor\u0027s ideas and his rhetoric were radicalized in tandem with Beck\u0027s.Read Post | CommentsDr. Cindy Haines, 8/16/11Dr. Cynthia Haines: Chief Medical Officer, HealthDay NewsPeople have needless biopsies, CT scans and other testing every day after a blood test opens the door to a concern -- and these can lead to major costs and complications.Read Post | CommentsDiane H. Mazur and Aaron Belkin, 8/16/11The repeal of DADT will be difficult for any future administration to reverse. That said, it\u0027s legally possible, and presidential candidate Michele Bachmann\u0027s stated intent to re-instate the military\u0027s ban is therefore of some concern.Read Post | CommentsRobert Naiman, 8/16/11Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicyAn argument against cuts to projected military spending that is sure to rear its ugly head is that this would cost American jobs.

Views are his own.President Obama said that Social Security is not an \"entitlement,\" or a \"driver of the deficit or debt,\" at a Minnesota Town Hall meeting on Monday.
