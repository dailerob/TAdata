{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Merry Christmas, HuffPosters. This year\u0027s It\u0027s A Wonderful Life Award goes to Gregory Schauer, the unemployed man who demonstrated the true Christmas spirit by taking in a homeless woman and her three children for the holidays. Remarkably, when we contacted Greg to tell him about all the people who had written in offering to help him, he told us: \"Please let them know that the best thing they can do is pass it on so to speak. Instead of sending me anything, call a shelter, sponsor a family for Christmas, give to the food pantries, spread the spirit of Christmas to as many people as they can.\" So, in Greg\u0027s honor, please go to The Goods, our online store featuring goods and services for those in need, and make a purchase in Greg\u0027s name (See full post for details on how -- my choice was to help pay the rent of a family in need in Greg\u0027s name).Read Post | Comments (38)Johann Hari, 12.23.2010Columnist for the London IndependentIn the endless whirr of 24/7 corporate news, the people who actually make a difference are often trampled in the stampede to the next forgettable news-nugget like Lady Gaga\u0027s meat-dress.
