The explicit purpose is to make patent protection stronger and longer. While these provisions are likely to lead to higher drug prices in the United States, they will have their greatest impact in the developing world. In most developing countries, drugs are far cheaper than in the United States. This is especially the case in India. The country has a world-class generic industry that produces high-quality drugs that typically sell for a small fraction of the price in the United States. The U.S. drug industry desperately wants to eliminate this sort of price gap, which can exceed a ratio of one hundred to one. This should have everyone very worried.The \"heritage\" of the Confederacy, the enduring belief in Lost Cause romanticism, the invention and adoption of revisionist \"traditions\" and culture, has become society\u0027s Old Faithful: a cultural geyser that periodically lets off steam.
