{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Howard FinemanEditorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupEliot Spitzer, the previously disgraced former governor of New York, told me today that he is testing what may be new dynamics of personal transgression and forgiveness in politics. In 2008, Spitzer resigned amid disclosures that he had paid as much as $80,000 to prostitutes over several years. Yesterday, a little more than five years after his humiliating departure, the 54-year-old Harvard-educated lawyer declared his candidacy for comptroller of New York City, a little-known but powerful post. Spitzer’s announcement comes in a campaign era that seems, at first glance, to have become more tolerant of second chances for those involved in sexual and marital scandals.Comments (449)Galip DalayPolitical researcher, SETA Foundation in TurkeyThe Islamist identity of Morsy and his party seems to be the major reason for the reticence of the international community and media in defining this coup a coup.Comments (300)Jeff CohenAuthor and media criticWith Obama in power, a number of MSNBC talking heads have reacted to the Snowden disclosures like Fox News hosts did when they were in hysterical damage control mode for Bush -- complete with ridiculously fact-free claims and national chauvinism that we\u0027ve long come to expect from the \"fair \u0026 balanced\" channel.Comments (670)Josh ZeppsHost and Producer, @HuffPostLiveThere\u0027s no doubt that Morsi was a disaster. There\u0027s no doubt that Islamism is the most pernicious strain of politics to grace the global stage today. But I\u0027m torn. To believe in democracy is to believe that people have the right to make their own mistakes, to elect their own pernicious fools, and to suffer the consequences of their own bad choices.Comments (150)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The Koch brothers -- whose companies are among America\u0027s 20 worst air-polluters -- have long been intent on blocking a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade system. And they, too, have been donating generously to Republicans to do their bidding.Comments (766)Ban Ki-moonSecretary-General, United NationsMalala Yousafzai may be one of the best-known students in the world, but she is also a teacher. This month she will mark her 16th birthday by coming to the United Nations and sharing an important lesson about education -- particularly for girls around the world.Comments (15)Rana FloridaCEO, The Creative Class Group \u0026 Author, UpgradeDon\u0027t disappoint your family or friends by getting stuck in the office. Here are some tips to ensure you get to take your vacation on your schedule.Comments (42)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkUntil we, the people of this nation, unite as one and continue fighting for expanded equality for all of God\u0027s children so that they may in fact be free from persecution, discrimination and the shackles of inequality, a post-racial America will only be a comfort on the lips of those seeking to advance themselves.Comments (25)Sara KeagleFlight attendant \u0026 founder of TheFlyingPinto.comSurviving a plane crash comes down to surviving the initial impact and getting out fast. With this in mind, what can you do to up the odds of survival and is there a \"safer\" place to sit on a flight?Comments (87)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027It is widely recognized that economists are not very good at economics. That is why we are looking at a decade of economic stagnation with tens of millions of people being unemployed or underemployed in Europe and the United States.CommentsNick TurseManaging Editor, TomDispatch.comIn the airport upon returning to the United States, I was singled out by a CBP agent. This agent proceeded to question me about the contents of my bag, pulled out my papers and began reading them. She also wanted to know about my profession.Comments (43)Dina PowellGlobal Head of Corporate Engagement, Goldman SachsIf the new Egypt, the most populous Arab nation in the world, empowers its women fully, it can also become the strongest, most prosperous and hopefully most peaceful nation in the region.CommentsRobert NaimanPolicy Director, Just Foreign PolicyIn addition to the importance of adhering to the rule of law -- not a small thing in its own right -- there are other good reasons to cut off U.S. aid to Egypt.Comments (18)Food52food52.comCulinary accidents tend to veer towards the disastrous. Sometimes though, with a little bit of luck, a simple mix-up can lead to a dish that\u0027s unexpectedly delicious. Sometimes forgetfulness allows the perfect combination of time and flavor to come together into a genius gastronomical invention.CommentsRoger HickeyCo-Director, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureFor four long years after the recession officially ended, conservative austerity policies have sabotaged America\u0027s economic recovery, condemning millions of Americans to unemployment and poverty. But conservative spending cuts still dominate policy.Comments (429)Randy HainManaging Partner of Bell Oaks Executive Search, Author, SpeakerStraight talk, given in love with a smile, is one of the best gifts we can offer a person. I often ask permission to be candid before I share critical feedback. This is usually appreciated and works well for me.CommentsBenjamin R. BarberDemocratic theorist; Author, \u0027Strong Democracy\u0027, \u0027Jihad vs. McWorld\u0027To be sure, there is no turning back -- we can\u0027t rewind history -- but going forward demands that we understand just how contradictory and uncertain has been the path of earlier democratic revolutions.CommentsPaul RaeburnAuthor, \u0027Do Fathers Matter? The New Science of Fatherhood\u0027I gathered that fact from a fascinating story in the August Esquire by Luke Dittrich, in which Dittrich comes as close as one could, without access to Alexander\u0027s private thoughts, to showing that the book was a cynical effort to provide a new career for a neurosurgeon whose career was being consumed by malpractice suits.Comments (59)Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027So is Edward Snowden a hero or a creepy betrayer? The fact that he is huddled in a Moscow airport waiting for some country to take him in lends credence to the betrayer view.Comments (617)Bennett L. GershmanProfessor of Law, PaceInstructing a jury to disregard something they\u0027ve already heard has been assailed as a fiction, a judicial fraud, and tantamount to telling a jury to \"un-ring a bell.\"Comments (30)Paula Davis-LaackLawyer turned stress \u0026 resilience expertThe more I burned out, the more I just wanted to hole up in my office and avoid people, and that was exactly the opposite of what I should have been doing. I didn\u0027t want to let people know how awful I was really feeling because I thought it meant I was weak.CommentsAri HartRabbi, Co-founder, Uri L\u0027Tzedek: Orthodox Social JusticeHow do we, as individuals and as a society make the difficult choices balancing privacy and security, sharing and oversharing, convenience and confidentiality?CommentsJames ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Change is never easy and is most often messy. If the events of the last two years have demonstrated anything it is that the Egyptian people want change, they feel empowered to demand change, and, when it is not forthcoming, those in power will be held on a short leash that can be pulled back.Comments (87)Raymond J. LearsyAuthor, \u0027Oil and Finance: The Epic Corruption Continues\u0027Will it be a serious and searching probe of the malevolent formation of prices in the oil industry, costing American and world consumers billions, or just a cursory headline in the manner of the now discredited \u0027The Oil and Gas Price Fraud Working Group.\u0027Comments (61)Mike WeisserThe Gun GuyTogether the Facebook pages of five gun violence prevention groups total slightly more than 100,000 supporters and this number probably represents numerous duplicates. The NRA is just shy of 2.5 million. That\u0027s a joke, and not a funny joke.Comments (182)Karen FrattiMedia and technology writerI know we all miss simpler days, hotter vampire sex, and Richard Edgington, but this season is hysterical so far. Jason and Andy are back on the same team, Eric\u0027s got his smirk back, and Sookie\u0027s on her way to kicking butt.Comments (28)Don TapscottAdvisor to government and business leaders; Author, \u0027Macrowikinomics\u0027Many of the features we take for granted in modern computing and communications can be traced back to the visionary work of Douglas Engelbart, who passed away last week at the age of 88. It is hard to overstate the importance of his pioneering insightsCommentsMurray LippSocial justice activistDespite the fact that full LGBT equality has not yet been achieved, the trend towards achievement of that goal is definitely clear.Comments (62)Suzan Haskins and Dan PrescherInternationalLiving.com EditorsThere are many ways to make a living overseas. You can start your own business, buy an existing business, become a real estate investor, do online trading, teach yoga, pet sit... the sky is the limit. And where there\u0027s a will, there\u0027s a way. We\u0027ve done it, and you can do it, too...Comments (89)Arzu Kaya UranliEditor, Zaman USAWe don\u0027t know yet what is coming next in Egypt. But we all know that true democracy can only be possible in a society where women are safe in public and when women\u0027s rights are in effect.Comments (33)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThis report, with its positive revisions, a whiff of increased labor force participation, and a bit of pop in wages suggests not just an improving job market, but one that\u0027s improving a bit faster than we thought.Comments (169)Dean Baker, 2013. 8.07Michelle Chen, 2013. 8.07Lester \u0026 Charlie, 2013. 8.07Sofie Karasek, 2013. 8.07Joel Reynolds, 2013. 8.07Chris Weigant, 2013. 8.07Mark Baer, 2013. 8.07Linden Schaffer, 2013. 8.07Anthony Amore, 2013. 8.07Jason Kitchen, 2013. 8.07Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"NYT: OBAMA WEIGHING AFGHAN \u0027ZERO OPTION\u0027",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
