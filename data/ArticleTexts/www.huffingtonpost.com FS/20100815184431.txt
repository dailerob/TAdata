{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Turns out the Republicans were against raising the deficit until they were for it -- at least when it comes to extending the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans (a move that comes with a budget price tag of $700 billion over the next decade). Whenever they are asked to explain the contradiction, the suddenly-plucked deficit hawks -- led by John Boehner -- fall back on the canard that if the Bush cuts are allowed to expire, more jobs will be lost. This reveals a total lack of understanding about how jobs are -- and aren\u0027t -- created. Hint: it has nothing to do with the personal tax rate of the people running the business. It has everything to do with demand -- from consumers, advertisers, government contracts, etc. When businesses have more demand, they hire more people. Simple. Maybe Boehner can skip a few rounds of golf and take an Economics 101 class.Read Post | CommentsSteven Chu, 08.10.2010U.S. Secretary of EnergyAll signs indicate that the cement is holding at the Deepwater Horizon well.
