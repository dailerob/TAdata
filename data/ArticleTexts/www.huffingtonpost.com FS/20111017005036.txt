{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"MADRID -- While in Europe, working on upcoming HuffPost international launches, I have received a flurry of emails from readers praising two remarkable pieces of enterprise journalism produced by HuffPost reporters this week. The first is the initial installment of Beyond the Battlefield, a ten-part series exploring the extraordinary challenges -- both physical and emotional -- faced by soldiers returning home from Afghanistan and Iraq with horrific injuries. The series, by HuffPost military correspondent David Wood, is based on many interviews done over the course of the last five months. It\u0027s impossible to read Beyond the Battlefield (or watch the videos) and not be moved. The other story that captivated readers is Chris Kirkham\u0027s investigation into how Goldman Sachs, just as the subprime mortgage boom was going bust, bought into another predatory play: for-profit colleges. Chris\u0027 relentless digging -- and resulting reporting -- connects all the dots and lays out a compelling and damning narrative. Don\u0027t miss them.Read Post | Comments (42)Amb. Alan D.
