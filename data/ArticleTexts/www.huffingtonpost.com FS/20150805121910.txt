She was my anti-stereotype.Actor, writer, director and hand-talkerThe killing of Cecil the Lion, tragic as it might be to some, has laid bare some key issues that warrant further discussion. Few -- if any -- of these people rallying for ol\u0027 Cecil have shown their public concern and care for Zimbabweans.Editor and contributor, Conversation ZimbabweThe rapid explosion of cell phones, YouTube and Twitter has increased public awareness of police misconduct toward black citizens.

And, it\u0027s not surprising that most employees at any company in the world want to perform well and be highly engaged.

But this study was done for a reason.Health.com motivates you to eat smart, stay fit, be happy, and live your best life.There are a great many other voters willing to imagine a future without Wall Street greed and rampant income inequality. \"Bernie Sanders Can Become President\" has replaced \"I like him but he can\u0027t win.\" With only a limited amount of media coverage, Sanders has captivated the hopes of millions of Americans.Columnist and author published in The Hill, The Baltimore Sun, The Jerusalem Post, Salon, and other publicationsI just finished watching the first \"candidates\u0027 forum\" (don\u0027t call it a debate!) of the season, where 14 of the 17 Republicans running for president all appeared on the same stage in New Hampshire.

We don\u0027t know what happened to that pie. Maybe the sun got hotter!\" Would you believe that their views are worthy of respect and should be given equal weight?Founder, Grub Street; former Associate News Editor, The Huffington PostFemale artists, particularly pop musicians, are continually defined within parameters that are practically impossible to satisfy: Not too sexy but not too prudish, not too aggressive but not too meek, not too serious or smart but not too fun or \"dumb.\" And it sets them up to \"fail.\"Chicago Editor, The Huffington PostI learned that decisions women make about our reproductive health aren\u0027t about death, but about life. Whether we are faced with an unintended pregnancy, or when a wanted pregnancy goes heartbreakingly wrong, we are simply trying to live the life we want for ourselves and our families.Wisconsin State Representative. Progressive. Advocate. Mother. Former Planned Parenthood Policy Director. Attorney.Was this former president\u0027s provocative allegation merely his opinion? Or was it actually lots more than that? It was lots more than that.Investigative historianMy secret lover, John Deere, and I are extremely grateful that Rep. Steve King has allowed man/mower unions to step out from the shadows. It is with enormous pride that I post the following announcementProfessor of Theater, Ursinus CollegeWithout an inchoate caliphate, ISIS becomes another bunch of terrorists roaming in the area, competing with several others.ISIS can be defeated, and quite readily.

Breastfeeding isn\u0027t all or nothing. It looks different for each mom and baby. And it is never anyone\u0027s place to judge a mom who chooses not to breastfeed. Whether or not you breastfed or were breastfed matters in many ways, and in many ways it doesn\u0027t matter at all.Mom, writer, lactation consultant (IBCLC)Any order that\u0027s too off-menu will have to be DIY.
