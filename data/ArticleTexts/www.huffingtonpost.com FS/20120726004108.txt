{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOThe current global interest rate convergence need not be a bad thing. But it will be if it is not quickly accompanied by major policy actions that address the causes of today\u0027s global economic malaise. What the world economy needs today is a coordinated set of measures to promote growth, allocate financial losses, match healthy balance sheets with those that are challenged and reforming, and improve the functioning of the labor and housing markets. For this to materialize, highly polarized and dysfunctional politics needs to give way to more strategic and constructive interactions across party lines and social segments.

Malloy, 07/25/12Governor of ConnecticutAs much as we\u0027d like it to be otherwise, the fact is that large problems call for equally large solutions.
