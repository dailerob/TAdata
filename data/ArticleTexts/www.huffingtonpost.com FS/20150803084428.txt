{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The EU was created to expand democracy, boost economic growth, and contain Germany within a democratic whole. Instead, it is destroying democracy, crushing growth, and leaving Germany\u0027s most churlish impulses to rule Europe. A recent New Yorker profile of the former Greek Finance Minister, Yanis Varoufakis, quotes him as saying, \"There are times when you say, \u0027I\u0027m not going to sign something I disagree with. And stuff the consequences.\u0027\" People all over Europe are expressing just those sentiments. Unlike World Wars I and II, the destruction being wrought by Germany is not military. But it is just as poisonous and more insidious. Before it is over, one of history\u0027s noblest experiments in enlightened statecraft -- the project of European union -- could end in ruins.President Sisi should know that the world will be watching the court\u0027s verdict on Aug. 29, and his government\u0027s response to it. Media freedom in the region is at stake. And, as the Council of Europe has put it, \"it will be the commitment shown to free speech which determines whether or not Egypt grows -- or shrinks [--] in the eyes of the world.\"LawyerLet\u0027s go back to Hwange National Park, the scene of Cecil\u0027s demise. The Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority, responsible for managing this park, derived most of its income for wildlife conservation across the country from trophy hunting. Let us mourn Cecil, but be careful what we wish for.Chair, IUCN Sustainable Use and Livelihoods Specialist GroupIt seems likely that the nominees in 2016 will be Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton. After all, the ruling class still controls America. But the revolt against the ruling class won\u0027t end with the 2016 election, regardless. Which means the ruling class will have to change the way it rules America. Or it won\u0027t rule too much longer.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027A little over 70 years ago, Paul Olum stood with his colleagues in the desert near Alamogordo, NM. They had spent the last few years designing the first atomic bomb. Six days after the bombing of Nagasaki, World War II was over -- and Paul Olum became a lifelong advocate of nuclear arms control and disarmament.Rabbi Emeritus, peace advocate and daughter of the late Paul Olum, Manhattan Project scientist and lifelong critic of the nuclear arms race.Hardly was the ink dry after the agreement July 17 between Greece and its creditors before columnists, commentators, economists and politicians jumped to far reaching conclusions: Greece would never make it. But often overlooked is the plain fact that the destiny of nations rests with the people -- Greece is no exception.Author, \u0027The Global Economy in Transition\u0027There is certainly a lot of outrage over the killing of Cecil the Lion by an American dentist. Yet, as Americans have grieved and raged against the killing of Cecil, many have not put that same energy and empathy into grieving and raging against the slaughter of African Americans in the U.S., especially by police.Professor of Theology, Chicago Theological SeminaryOur Utah trip tested the fears of at least one of us. Together, we marveled at the vast landscape, the untouched earth, and as a pair, we found a home in the great outdoors. I\u0027m sure it\u0027s a concept that resonates with many of us, but which is actually attained so rarely. It\u0027s what keeps us enjoying our beautiful country. But I still asked myself: Was it the place? Was it my daughter? Or was it me?Author, research psychologist and gender scholarThe leading medical organizations plus the American Bar Association believe that \"deaths and injuries related to firearms constitute a major public health problem in the United States.\" This consensus is not going to change because some judge thinks that doctors should avoid the issue of guns.Mike the Gun GuyAware of the legacy of the Bush years, the Obama White House, the Department of Homeland Security, and the FBI have spent much time and effort rethinking previous policies and have designed what they are calling a \"new\" approach to security.Director, Center on National Security at Fordham Law SchoolThe Times could have insisted on seeing the documents they were describing. Or, if the Times spoke with Republicans in Congress, even off the record, they could have checked their facts with me or other Committee Democrats. Unfortunately, this rush to print anonymous, unverified claims against Secretary Clinton is not unique.Congressman from Maryland\u0027s 7th DistrictYears ago, Rev. Jesse Jackson would open up several of his speeches by loudly asking, \"What time is it?\" He would answer his own question by responding, \"Nation time!\" Well, it\u0027s \"Nation time\" again. Only this time, it is more urgent.Diversity Visiting Professor, University of San Francisco; and Scholar Writer in Residence, MLK, Jr. Institute, Stanford UniversitySeventy years after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the world can not remain in this legal no man\u0027s land, between threat of mass destruction and balance of terror. Accepting the status quo means admitting the scenario of a backward and, thereby, that an atomic bombing could again occur.Professor at the Faculty of Law of the University Lusófona of Porto (Portugal), visiting professor at Sciences Po Paris and the Catholic University of Lille (France)Vice president of the organization Arrêtez La Bombe and France Director of the Parliamentarians for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament (France)My body positivity does not hinge on the idea that all bodies are perfect as they are, because for some of us, this isn\u0027t true to our experience. But all bodies are worthy -- meaning we should treat them with love and care, whatever that care looks like so long as it\u0027s good for us.There\u0027s no wrong way to be a woman.The vice presidency is both a blessing and a curse. It\u0027s a blessing if you are running for your party\u0027s nomination. Then it turns into a curse when you run in the general election. Any Democrat who gets the nomination next year will face the charge that he, or she, represents a third term for Obama. With Biden, the charge will stick.Professor, George Mason University; contributor, Al JazeeraEven though it didn\u0027t live up to my very high expectations for all things yoga and 98 Degrees, at the end of the day I still get to say I did hot yoga with 98 Degrees. Hey, that\u0027s pretty cool.Healthy Living Writer, HuffPost TVThe 2016 Republican presidential contest has barely begun and it has already grown alternately tiresome and old or just downright scary. As a Democrat, I might be pleased, but as an American, I am deeply troubled. I just want it to end.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027How high must an American president get to escape the sweltering heat of the Washington summer? About 1,700 feet. That\u0027s how high Camp David, the official presidential retreat, sits in the relatively cool Catoctin Mountains, 62 miles from the White House.Political journalist, nature photographer, blues guitarist.South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, one of the world\u0027s leading peace and justice advocates, has called Bryan Stevenson \"America\u0027s Nelson Mandela.\" He has gotten innocent men off death row, successfully argued before the U.S. Supreme Court multiple times, including to ban \"death sentences.\"President, Children\u0027s Defense FundI hadn\u0027t been on the dating market for oh say ... 18 years. But unbeknownst to me I\u0027m currently out there \"Looking For Fun.\"Relationship Sensei, Mom Butler, Wife Dominatrix, Slightly MustachioedBig-game hunting leaves us troubled, I surmise, because it summons us to think of its sordid past. Big-game hunting no longer serves any social utility. Perhaps big-game hunting will vanish from the modern world, through the force of social criticism if not by positive legislative enactment.Professor of Law, University of St. ThomasAs we pinpoint the cause of our anger through compassionate self-exploration, we can learn how to simultaneously decode its helpful warnings and respond to it constructively.For anyone who is interested in leading a healthful lifestyleEveryone loves Italian. From homemade pasta sauces to homemade bread, these recipes are serious family pleasers. It\u0027s hard to improve on sweet summer tomatoes and fresh mozzarella, but a drizzle of balsamic glaze adds a pop of tangy-sweet flavor to every bite.Chef, Recipe Developer and Busy MomWhile stress causes some people to crumble, mentally strong people continue to thrive in the midst of added tension.Psychotherapist and author of \u002713 Things Mentally Strong People Don\u0027t Do\u0027Would you consider yourself a typical bride? If you get sick at the idea of taking a loan out for your wedding, or feel that diamond rings are more marketing gimmick than romantic symbol, consider yourself a practical anti-Pinterest bride.Writer. Runner. Editor of StylebyFire.ca | Twitter: @theMirandaSamHow do you know when you\u0027re old? None of my peers seem to know they\u0027re old. Even after they see their wrinkles and gray hair, whine about arthritic pain and celebrate another monumental birthday, all I ever hear them say is, \"I\u0027m getting old.\" They don\u0027t get the connection between those old age signs and actually being old.Author, Syndicated Humor Columnist, bloggerMattress lifespan depends on many factors, but following these best practices can help ensure that you enjoy years of healthy sleep and that your investment lasts as long as possible.Writer, Content Manager at AmerisleepMy advice to teachers and school administrators this fall is to ignore the unit sequence in the Common Core aligned ELA curriculum. If someone complains, explain that you think it is more important that the ELA and social studies curriculum be coordinated so they make sense and support student learning.Social studies educator, Hofstra University, my opinions, of course, are my ownAll three cocktails utilize peak season produce such as: blackberries, mint, ginger, cucumbers, lemon and lavender; and all ingredients are highly complimentary to gin. All beverages are light, refreshing and go down really smoothly -- you have been warned.Private chef, culinary school graduate and second-generation foodieI can\u0027t help but wonder how many of the reviewers have simply contrived their headlines to grab our attention in a noisy and cluttered culture, and how many actually believe what they\u0027re saying, and are thus perhaps, like mockingbirds.Bestselling Author, Speaker, Philosopher at TomVMorris.comRecently I was clicking on links, another short cut we all do now- we\u0027re fed some news item on our Facebook page, or the actual news page, and from there it\u0027s a veritable rabbit hole of links. By the time you end up on some twisted site about how dogs are tortured, you\u0027ve probably seen all kinds of inside out items you never would have searched for, and you might have adopted a puppy.Mother, Writer, Traveler, Treasure Hunter and Sushi lover.
