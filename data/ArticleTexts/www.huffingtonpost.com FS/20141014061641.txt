{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghWe have not had one since Barack Obama entered the Oval Office six years ago. This means that the United States\u0027 external relations have not been guided by a comprehensive strategy based on a conception of our place in the world and a clear sense of our interests. Without such a strategy, purposeful actions informed by and meant to serve a coherent scheme happen by coincidence rather than intention. The potential costs of the resulting ad hocism and short-termism are now manifest in the Middle East, where we are muddling through the IS/Iraq/Syria crisis -- and will continue indefinitely. It is impossible to foresee what we will do next, or even lay out a set of reasonable options, due to the multiple contradictions of our disjointed policies in the region.Striking a balance between humanitarian assistance for developing nations and preserving the resource of healthcare workers will take more than a team of idealistic doctors rushing into Africa with the hope of saving some lives.George E. Wantz Distinguished Professor of the History of Medicine and director of the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of MichiganDuring off-year elections, too many women stay home when their votes are needed. In the last midterm election, 10 million unmarried women who voted in 2008 did not show up! As a result, conservatives swept to power and eviscerated policies aimed at supporting American women, especially in healthcare.Singer; Actress; Director; Composer; ActivistAt 9 p.m. on that August night, when I arrived for my first shift as a cocktail waitress at Whispers, one of the two strip clubs in downtown Williston, I didn\u0027t expect a 25-year-old man to get beaten to death outside the joint. Then again, I didn\u0027t really expect most of the things I encountered reporting on the oil boom in western North Dakota this past summer.Author, \u0027A Dream Foreclosed\u0027Imagine a system of college education supported by high and growing government spending on elite private universities that mainly educate children of the wealthy and upper-middle class, and low and declining government spending on public universities that educate large numbers of children from the working class and the poor. You can stop imagining.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Not only is the deficit down sharply from its levels of 2009 and 2010, when it was near 10 percent of GDP, it is below the levels that even the deficit hawks had targeted back in those years. In other words, even if we had followed the lead of deficit crusaders like Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson, the deficit would be no lower today.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Iowa remains ground zero for the fight for the Senate, and for early voting mobilization activities. As of Friday, 119,141 Iowans had voted in the 2014 general election, representing 10.5 percent of the total vote in 2010.Associate Professor, University of FloridaLast week, in the tightly contested Senate race in Kentucky, both Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell and his Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes gave newsworthy interviews in which they seemed to stumble over basic questions. But only one of the awkward missteps was treated as big news.Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaThe U.S. economy is growing slowly and Europe\u0027s hardly at all. The stock market lurch last week is a belated acknowledgement that our two economies share a common affliction, and Europe suffers more seriously. The affliction is austerity. And yet the main remedy being promoted by the U.S. government and its European allies is a trade and investment deal known as T-TIP.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027One little girl I met, seven-year-old Elizabeth, was living under a house with her older brother just steps away from where their mother\u0027s body had been taken over a month ago. They had come and burned all their belongings and sprayed down the room but the children would not go back inside. While they survived the 21-day incubation period, they now faced the prospect of starvation and stigma as people in their town are too scared to even look at them.President \u0026 CEO, Save the ChildrenThe real reason that people call funnyman Stewart \"the most trusted news source in America\" is that he\u0027s an outsider. He rarely worries about offending his journalistic colleagues or angering high-level news sources who won\u0027t return his phone calls -- because he doesn\u0027t really have any.Author, \u0027Tear Down This Myth\u0027Saying that \"Ukraine is empowered to join Europe\" is an empty phrase. However, when you point out the mutual interests that ensure that, as in Mandeville\u0027s fable of the bees, where private vices commingle to produce public good, Ukraine will in fact be part of Europe, it becomes a phrase with real impact.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.Living with a chronic mental illness often feels like waiting for the other shoe to drop. I\u0027ve been struggling for a while, but I\u0027m finally coming around to admitting it. Despite seeing therapists on and off for nearly 10 years, I still find it hard to communicate how I feel. But even more difficult is being honest with myself about how I am feeling.Reader, writer, tweeter and mental health advocate.While at the food bank, I talked with other volunteers as well as those there to collect food -- an experience that opened my eyes to the faces of hunger in our country. The people in line who needed food were often indistinguishable from the volunteers.ActorYes, it\u0027s true that about a third of species we\u0027ve evaluated are threatened with extinction, and that we\u0027ve killed about half of all our wildlife in the past forty years. But with all the gloomy predictions being thrown about, you may not know that the Sixth Mass Extinction is not a done deal.Professor, researcher, authorThe not-so-subtle message was that if women worked hard, then wage inequality wouldn\u0027t exist. This advice might be logical if women weren\u0027t already working hard, if our country had a system with a level playing field where people were judged fairly, and if rampant wage inequality wasn\u0027t already the norm.Executive Director/CEO and Co-Founder of MomsRising.orgIt\u0027s long overdue that more of us get serious about doing something different with Columbus Day.Pastor, Author, and Co-Creator of \"Living the Questions\" curriculum for Progressive ChristiansHalloween, with its blood and gore, witches and werewolves, is a children\u0027s holiday because its horrors are fictional. Republicans have picked up on that theme for their Halloween fear-mongering. Fabricating characters and events to induce terror is just part of the GOP-Halloween scheme.International President, United SteelworkersSome mistakes in life are big, like cheating on your SATs or accidentally getting yourself imprisoned and caned for vandalizing a truck in Singapore, but others are THE BIGGEST, like drinking beer all wrong.Everything worth caring about in food, drink, and travelI worked at a radio station, a national television network, three local news stations, a reality television production company, a politician\u0027s press office, a weekly newspaper, a national newspaper and at a food start-up. I was also heavily involved in my college newspaper.Writer based in LA and owner of a food tour companyHave you ever wondered why the line \"Bond, James Bond\" sounds so cool? I mean, there\u0027s not much content there. It\u0027s just a character saying his name. But it\u0027s one of the most famous lines in movie history. It\u0027s right up there with \"Run, Forest, run.\"Writer, Journalist, ProofreaderThere is some chatter amongst some D.C. Democrats that it really doesn\u0027t matter in the South Dakota Senate race which of the two candidates running against Republican Mike Rounds beats him. Democrats, simply put: This is crazy talk.Co-Founder, Democracy PartnersAs difficult as this kind of chronic pain can be, the hours of exhaustion that pile on, I\u0027ve also learned several invaluable lessons on how to survive, to love, and even, sometimes, to thrive. Here are the five most important things I\u0027ve picked up on my journey.Writer, Life Enthusiast, Easily AmusedIt has been said that measure of a society is its humane attention to the sick and vulnerable. When real reform, transformation, comes to mental health and addiction services we will meet that moral and ethical standard -- and we will be able to serve so many in need.Medical director, New York State Office of Mental HealthMedical director, New York State Office of Mental HealthAt first I didn\u0027t recognize him. It\u0027s incredible how our bodies, our minds, try to protect us. The person who has haunted me most, impacted every decision I\u0027ve ever made, who taught me what real fear was, and I still thought, \"No, that\u0027s not how he spells his last name.\"Writer, Feminist, Teacher in Cleveland, OHA specter is haunting America - the privatization of its public schools, and Big Money has entered into an unholy alliance to aid and abet it. Multi-billionaire philanthropists and others are making common cause to hasten the destruction of public schools.Retired high-school teacherI\u0027m not in any way opposed to using a gun or anything else for genuine, self-defense. But I am opposed to the shameless pandering of the NRA and other gun promoters to the childish fantasy that if you walk around with a gun, that you\u0027re protecting yourself or others from harm.Mike the Gun GuyRepublicans are conflating crises as if there\u0027s an ISIS terrorist with Ebola at the Border. Lowry and Shrum debate if hitting the panic button can work in November, and if Dems can counter with good economic news and GOP voter obstruction. Then: Is Panetta patriotic or betraying?On the heels of the most impressive win of the Jason Garrett era and of this NFL season, the 5-1 Dallas Cowboys sit tied atop the NFC East after out-Seahawking the Seattle Seahawks 30-23 Sunday. And yet, all is not perfect with Dallas -- far from it actually.The Huffington Post\u0027s sports columnist, The Schultz ReportGone is the rose-tinted vision of Israel as an island of democracy in a sea of irrational and violent Arabs. Gone is the belief that Israel wants to negotiate, if only it could find a partner to talk to. Gone, too, is the notion that there is symmetry in this conflict.Editor, Middle East EyeThis may be the 21st century, but we\u0027re still finding that culture, customs and religion continue to have as strong a pull in the opposite direction as science and facts. But Ebola can be halted with education, safe practices and infection control. And that is a message we must continue to underline.President and CEO of Project HOPEGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"UP TO 70 EXPOSED",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
