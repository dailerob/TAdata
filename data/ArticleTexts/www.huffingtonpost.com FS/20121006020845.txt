{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Fellow, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesPayrolls grew by 114,000 last month and the unemployment rate ticked down significantly to 7.8 percent, according to today\u0027s jobs report from the BLS. That\u0027s the lowest unemployment rate since January of 2009. Moreover, unlike last month\u0027s report, September\u0027s decline in the unemployment rate was due to more job seekers finding work, not giving up and leaving the labor market. Both July and August\u0027s jobs numbers were revised up significantly such that in the third quarter of the year, payrolls grew by 146,000 per month on average, a notable acceleration over the second quarter\u0027s growth pace of only 67,000 jobs per month. All told, this report and the revisions paint a considerably better labor market picture than the last few reports. We\u0027re not yet out of the labor market woods, and I\u0027d like to see us moving more quickly, but we\u0027re on the right path.Read Post | Comments (236)Bob Herbert, 10/04/12Former New York Times columnistIt\u0027s time to stop making excuses for Barack Obama.
