{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Democracy 21In 2007, with the additions of Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito to the Supreme Court, a new 5 to 4 majority emerged on the Court extremely hostile to campaign finance laws. This led to the Citizens United decision and the McCutcheon decision, which together have blown a massive hole in the campaign finance laws big enough for an army to drive through. Citizens United overturned a century of national policy and decades of Supreme Court decisions to hold that corporations could make expenditures in elections as long as they were made independent of the candidates being supported. In other words, today, donors can give and candidates can receive legalized bribes.In implicating Trump as a bigot and, by association, the audience as cohorts or sheep, the media, especially the photo media, thoroughly missed the most curious and unscripted moment of this dispiriting campaign.Publisher of the visual politics and media literacy site, Reading The Pictures.Journalists try to gather information. Protesters try to push buttons. Sam Dorman\u0027s admission that he was trying to push a button on Pelosi and provoke the response he got is all the evidence we need that he was in protest mode, not journalist mode.Founder and Editor, ConWebWatch.com; former senior editor, Media MattersNow, the concept of \"going to the gym\" has been increasingly overshadowed by niche fitness classes. All of them promising to be the best workout you will ever get on planet earth. These classes also come with pretty package incentives, which are absurdly overpriced and can hardly be considered motivation to join.TV Producer turned Comedian and CommentatorJeb Bush\u0027s recent use of \"stuff happens\" perfectly encapsulates the attitude about gun violence that is now prevalent in the Republican Party. The fact that this \"stuff\" happens more in America than anywhere else in the developed world doesn\u0027t seem to change their mind that mass shootings are an inevitable act of nature.President, People For the American WayParenting without the weight of the marital failure has been freeing. The feelings of a relationship ended are not neatly secured in a trash bag, disposed in a dump, never to be thought of again. Fragments remain. But they need no longer control us. And what is left is a deep, abiding love.Director of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel HillAssistant Director, Lineberger Cancer Center, UNCI want you to learn at a very early age to be comfortable talking about your anxieties, struggles and fears. Most importantly, I hope these eight things help you live an authentic life with the understanding that you\u0027re never alone.Lifestyle Blog Editor, The Huffington Post\"I\u0027m a grinder....I\u0027ve never taken more than a week off in my adult life. I truly believe work is a virtue, it gives you purpose. I love my family, love my grandkids.\"theSkimm makes it easier to be smarter. We read. You Skimm. Sign up at www.theskimm.com/huffpo to start your day off right.The fate of women in Afghanistan has been the moral linchpin for the continued occupation by U.S. and NATO forces since the presidency of George W. Bush. But according to experts and women across the war-torn country, little has changed for women there despite upwards of $1.5 billion spent to empower women and girls.Political activist and authorLondon-based journalistIf I\u0027m not really familiar with Gaga and our interests are probably quite different, what in the world could I possibly have in common with her? The commonality that links me and Lady Gaga is this: We were both raped. And we both seem to find some healing in the telling of our story.Best selling Author, Speaker, and Survivors’ AdvocateOne reason for our shamefully low turnout is America\u0027s ramshackle voter registration system. States have slowly improved the process over the last decade. But this year, a bold new reform has caught on -- automatic voter registration, starting at DMVs.President of the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of LawI look around and I know. None of this -- the municipal complex, the school across the street, the supermarket up the road -- is built for 100 years, especially not this hundred years. It won\u0027t last. And I can\u0027t imagine a better future version of this either.Columnist, Waging Nonviolence; author of \"It Runs in the Family: On Being Raised by Radicals and Growing into Rebellious Motherhood\"Protesters warned about the problems the Pacific Rim trade deal could bring to people around the world. Whether it\u0027s jobs being shipped overseas and wages being driven down in the U.S., medicine prices going through the roof, more pollution or unsafe food and products heading to our shores as a result of this bad trade deal, that wasn\u0027t enough to sway TPP negotiators.General President, International Brotherhood of TeamstersThe weight of everything that\u0027s wrong in the world shouldn\u0027t fall on the generation that didn\u0027t screw things up in the first place. Millennials aren\u0027t dumb, and we\u0027d love to show you how to build social media platforms and crowd-fund world-changing start-ups once we finish taking this selfie.Recent Graduate, Colby CollegeUnlike those who\u0027ve taken to social media to express their disgust over Cosmopolitan Magazine\u0027s crowing of the Kardashians as \"America\u0027s First Family,\" I\u0027ve failed to understand the big to-do about the headline on the cover of their November issue. Love or hate them, the Kardashians embody what our country has come to represent to the rest of the world; vanity and excess.Radio host, writer, producerEven given the policy analysis failures of Trump\u0027s positions, other leading Republican contenders for the presidency are far more clearly referring to mental health as an excuse to dodge gun control rather than develop a functional system.Research assistant for the Global Initiative for Civil Society and Conflict. Writer for The Hill.There is an abundance of research pointing to the effectiveness of early treatment of mental illness in reducing developmental delays and the health damaging complications of these disorders during these critical early years of a child\u0027s life.Public Health Editor, The Huffington Post; Former U.S. Assistant Surgeon GeneralAll of those things I worked so hard for in my twenties and achieved? I watched them get ripped away from me almost immediately.Blogger, AJD PublicationsPractice the following five exercises on a weekly or bi-weekly basis and get rid of that aching back.National fitness expert, speaker, contributor to Prevention magazine, author of several books and fitness DVDsIf I could sum up the era of my life in which I was discovering my sexuality in one word, that word would be: shame. Despite the personal nature of this story, I feel compelled to share it, because I fully believe that no young woman should have to experience such intense shame -- yet the sad truth is, most do.Writer, musician, lover of life.While focused on Qatar, the campaign also targeted other Gulf states and prompted other activists to focus on high-profile construction projects like sites for Western museums and universities in the UAE. It also motivated countries across the region to tinker with their labour systems.Senior fellow, S. Rajaratnam School of International StudiesIf I\u0027m judgmental of you, just because of how you breathe and who you are, that anger will consume me and I can\u0027t be myself. When folk hate or reject LGBT people, it affects the person who is doing the hating.Executive Director, NETWORK, A National Catholic Social Justice LobbyThis is the month when Latinos are officially celebrated for everything we have achieved and contributed to this country. Yet the celebration of Latino Heritage Month is bittersweet, because we remain the most underrepresented group in politics and government leadership.Eric Garcetti\u0027s Chief of StaffGosar defended his outlandish statements by claiming to be a \"proud Catholic\" who attended a Midwestern Jesuit College. He cites his \"excellent education\" that provided an opportunity for him to \"think critically, to welcome debate and discussion and to be held accountable for [his] actions.\"Aspiring Multimedia Journalist/NBC Sports Game Logger/Emerson College GradIf you\u0027re going on vacation, chances are you want to have a good time, and sleep may not be your top priority. But getting poor quality rest can put a serious drag on your festivities, whether traveling for business or pleasure.Writer, Content Manager at AmerisleepInstead of giving refugees arriving in Germany a fair chance to settle, allowing them to make a respectable adjustment into work and education, more and more self-declared experts are taking the opportunity to point fingers.Political journalist, HuffPost GermanyThe Berenstain Bears volumes are mild jeremiads meant to protect our little ones from the potholes of early development and it\u0027s surprising there isn\u0027t The Berenstain Bears Stick Their Finger in a Wall Socket or The Berenstain Bears Stick Their Knife in the Toaster.WriterAt the height of the Cultural Revolution, Project 523 -- a covert operation launched by the Chinese government and headed by a young Chinese medical researcher by the name of Tu Youyou -- discovered what has been the most powerful and effective anti-malarial drug therapy to date.Independent source of news and analysis, from the academic and research community.Ultimately, this is a decision that Joe Biden has to make. And, by all accounts, it is a hell of an emotional one. I feel for him. There\u0027s always a chance that Biden could run, and win. But the chances are, frankly, slim.Public Relations Consultant, www.winningprogressive.comIt took a coordinated response from the Department of Health and Human Services and partners around the government to fight this epidemic. Those efforts have made us better prepared than we were a year ago.Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, US Department of Health and Human ServicesNow is the time to elevate engineering as key to innovation. While we can\u0027t all be Sally Ride or John Glenn, we can learn enough about engineering to thrive in our complex technological world. Let\u0027s make the Orion spacecraft, designed to take humans into deep space, a real first step toward Mars.President, Museum of Science, Boston; former NASA Advisory Council member; Center for Advancement of Science in Space Board member; engineerGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
