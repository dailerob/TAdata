But that was then, and while we all deeply care about our brothers and sisters overseas, there is so much that needs to be done in the U.S. for LGBT people that an American presidential candidate could promise right now.

Headlines matter -- that is what most people read and then stop. Collapsing the two driving records in that one headline smears the candidate. She is the one with the driving problem -- 13 violations to his four.Host, Fox News\u0027 \u0027On the Record With Greta Van Susteren\u0027To my great sadness, the modern conservative movement has devolved into something quite different from the kind of Bob Dole conservatism I grew up around. It\u0027s not necessarily more conservative, mostly just a whole lot meaner. It is important to note, though, that there are two different kinds of meanness that animate it, and they are very different from each other.Co-Founder, Democracy PartnersInnovative drug policies being practiced around the world are keeping people out of prison, getting help for those who need it, reducing HIV, crime and overdose deaths.
