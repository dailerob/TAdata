{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor Emerita, USC Marshall School; Author, \u0027The Secret Handshake\u0027 and \u0027Shadow Campus\u0027All political candidates dissemble. Indeed, all people do. A degree of deception is required in order to be civil. \"It was a pleasure to meet you,\" is often just a way to gracefully exit a conversation. But at what point does a political candidate take deception too far? In Hillary Clinton\u0027s case, that is a critical question. Andrea Mitchell told Clinton she has an authenticity problem. S.A. Miller of the Washington Times described Clinton\u0027s \"authenticity gap\" as a major issue for her coming up to the New Hampshire primary. What does it mean to be authentic, particularly an authentic politician? The term may seem an oxymoron. Politics by nature is about strategy, knowing what to say when, in what way, and to whom. Where is the room for authenticity?What we are looking at is a middle class that is dying, literally, and a party that supposedly represents them holding their head under water. As long as the GOP fights middle class progress they will have a difficult time reaching the votes they need outside of rural areas and winning the presidency.Former Intelligence Specialist, Veteran, WriterWe are sequencing the world -- from ourselves to all of the organisms upon which we depend as a living planet. In the future, our planetary genome might include new life forms built in the lab; there is even talk of the possibility of a resurrected Neanderthal, carried by a surrogate human mother. Science fiction? Not anymore.Author, Biocode: The New Age of GenomicsI am a woman in a man\u0027s profession, and it\u0027s certainly time that the prevalence of societal sex-stereotyping is publicly addressed. We begrudgingly accept this level of misogyny and anti-family sentiment when it\u0027s subtle, constitutive and mixed with praise for being tough. After all, this is surgery. And surgeons are tough.Breast cancer surgeon, mom, wife.There are plenty of reasons to get your credit into the best shape possible. New car models are hitting showrooms, real estate may become more expensive (many believe the Federal Reserve will raise the prime lending rate), and (like it or not) the holiday shopping season is almost upon us.Author of Swiped. Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and IDT911There was a moment at a recent rally when the nature of the tuition beast was suddenly, and unforgettably, revealed; when \"Mandy,\" an anonymous NYU junior, took the stage to tell exactly how, and why, she had no choice but to become a prostitute to meet NYU\u0027s soaring price.Professor of Culture and Communication, New York UniversityI fear that many of my Republican colleagues do not understand that war must be a last resort, not the first resort. It is easy to go to war, it not so easy to comprehend the unintended consequences of that war.U.S. Senator from VermontLast year, we highlighted Jimmy\u0027s story on Huffington Post, which led to a number of bone-marrow cheek-swab submissions, but unfortunately Jimmy is still looking for a match. As we approach the 14th anniversary of the events on September 11th, we\u0027re taking a moment to remember his story -- and hope to find a match to save this honorable heroes life.Kiva FellowYes, they were bullshit. And yes, they were probably worthwhile. In other words, the MDGs may -- may -- have been the right development initiative for the world of the late 1990s, but they are increasingly irrelevant to the one we have now.Blogger, Rottin\u0027 in DenmarkNobody knew what had happened: Dad didn\u0027t, nor did the police. I knew, though. My body was screaming the truth at me, great waves of horror sweeping through it. And, as hard as my body screamed, my head fought against what was utterly inconceivable.Firefighter, Author \u0026 Physiotherapist.The refugees I have known didn\u0027t feel entitled to anything. They hated living off of food stamps, welfare, government cheese, and in an internment-like and/or poverty stricken communities. But they appreciated the assistance, making the best of what came their way.Host of Finding Rebecca podcast and multi-dimensional freelancer.Every season the push for racial diversity during Fashion Week is as much a part of the conversation as what\u0027s trending on designer runways. However, spotting models representing all shades and sizes continues to be more of the exception than the rule.Editor-in-Chief, Essence MagazineToday we launched a campaign will make it possible for all of America to be great. Not just Silicon Valley or Hollywood. Not just Nashville or Broadway. Not just the heartland or the White Mountains. But even Washington, D.C. too. Today we have launched a campaign to give us a government we can be proud of again.Law professor, activist, candidate in the Democratic Primary for PresidentCongress is back, and they\u0027re already moaning about how much they have to do in September. After all, they\u0027ve got an upcoming budgetary train wreck to create, the Pope is going to visit and -- first on their list of looming deadlines -- they\u0027re supposed to vote on the Iran nuclear deal.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comLiving as whites within a system that gives us unfair advantages, we often continue to act out those advantages with people of color, even as we seek to address inequity. We expect to lead when we should follow. We expect to teach when we need to learn.Dismantling racism from the inside outBoth China and the U.S. face enormous challenges at home, common security problems, and an array of international crises that could really use the coordinated efforts of two superpowers. But both have about as much capacity to work together at the moment as Donald Trump and Jeb Bush.Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogOpening the new community toilet may lack the glamour of cutting the ribbon on a new hospital, so fewer politicians lobby for their communities to gain sanitation.Chief Executive of WaterAidThe K2 drug scare has become inextricably linked to the East Harlem\u0027s homelessness problem, particularly to the corner of 125th and Lexington, which has long had a significant population of homeless people and is also the site of increasing gentrification.New York deputy state director, Drug Policy AllianceCongress shall make no law prohibiting the free exercise of religion. The question (and it is a question that cannot be answered by just parsing the text) is, What does it mean to freely exercise one\u0027s religion?Davidson-Kahn Distinguished University Professor and Professor of Law at Florida International University; Floershimer Distinguished Visiting Professor of Law at Cardozo Law SchoolInstalling toilets in India without addressing behavioral change has resulted in thousands of free toilets becoming storage sheds or chicken coops, while the owners continue to defecate outside.Founder, World Toilet Organization and BOP HUBThis book explores the gruesome misdeeds of a murderer (and rapist), but it is also an extended reflection on how and why one might write about, and even befriend, such people. On both counts, it is an admirable success.Author, \u0027The Catonsville Nine: A Story of Faith and Resistance in the Vietnam Era\u0027We cannot continue indefinitely to strike at jihadists in Iraq while stopping, absurdly, at the border of the neighboring state.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.It\u0027s expensive to be poor. So expensive in fact that people who live below a country\u0027s poverty line can end up paying 5-15x per liter of water compared to people who live above that poverty line.Chief executive officer and co-founder of Water.orgActor and Co-founder, Water.orgMore is at stake than individual health; international security is at risk. Experts have identified water as the number one global risk in terms of significant negative impact on countries in the coming decade. Water can either be a source of conflict or cooperation.Deputy Secretary-General, United NationsGovernor John Kasich (R - OH) worries that the Kentucky spectacle of Christian extremism will turn people away from religion. He is right to worry. I am disgusted by the un-American, hypocritical, mean-spirited rallies and shows of support for Kim Davis.Professor of Theater, Ursinus CollegeNew York has long been overdo for a Sarah Charlesworth retrospective. Throughout the summer of 2015, the New Museum filled the void with Doubleword a partial-survey of Charlesworth\u0027s work curated by Massimiliano Gioni and Margot Norton, a most welcome arrival.Cultural critic, essayist and novelist published with Parkett, Art in America and Bijutsu TechoThe Broncos, widely used in the Vietnam war, were delivered to Indonesia in 1977-1978, when the slaughter of the Timorese civilian population was at its worst. Torture and mass executions were commonplace. Political prisoners were dropped live from helicopters, entire villages purposely starved to death, and more. Most Americans are little aware of either of these events.Former President, East Timor, 1996 Nobel Peace Prize laureateDonald Trump may not be Ronald Reagan, but the Ronald Reagan that whipped Jeb\u0027s father was not the saint of people\u0027s imagination either. Jeb might have the better resume, he might be a man of compassion, but neither experience nor compassion are the currencies of the moment.President, Fiscal Strategies GroupThe school-to-prison pipeline is a no-nonsense trend in American education, where children are directed straight from the classroom and into the bureaucratic clutches of the criminal justice system.Journalist, author and advocate for global reform of the prison system.Our global economic and political system is the root cause of the problem, so instead of blaming Europe, lets fix the problemNow we witness the return of the medium in Greece, after six whole years. Will it influence something this time? It would be difficult, but it is not impossible. While voters remain reluctant and morose, and political leaders fail, it may play a role.Editor-At-Large, HuffPost GreeceGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
