{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Here we are, approaching Christmas 2014. Racism still taints the American dream. And unlike, say, in 1964 when there was a sense of a movement on the march with history on its side, it is hard to summon up optimism. It is one thing when the government decrees that blacks can\u0027t vote, can\u0027t patronize restaurants, can\u0027t apply for good jobs. That sort of racism shames everyone. But when cops brutalize young black men, and prosecutors wink, and grand juries refuse to indict, that sort of racism is deeper in the social fabric and much harder to explicitly root out. It is encouraging to see outraged citizens on the march again, heartening that the marches includes whites as well as blacks and other groups. Yet what sort of movement, what sort of policies, what sort of majority support in the country can we imagine that will fix what is broken?When President Obama returns to India this January, he will become the first U.S. president to celebrate Republic Day as chief guest.

This must stop. America can\u0027t tackle widening inequality without confronting the power and privilege lying behind it.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Greetings from India, where I\u0027m thrilled to announce we\u0027re launching our latest international edition, in collaboration with The Times of India Group and its digital arm, Times Internet (TIL).Do not be silent. Do not be complacent. Do not continue to live with police misconduct and violence as somehow acceptable. We are not anti-police; we are anti-police-brutality. And today we challenge Congress to follow in the president\u0027s footsteps and take legislative action to protect us, the citizens.President, National Action NetworkOne thing I\u0027ve come to realize over a few cycles of depression is this: depressed people don\u0027t need you to empathize; they just need you. A depressed person would rather have you say all the worst possible things, rather than not have you at all.Blogger at \u0027Under Reconstruction\u0027, Artist, Aspiring Special Educator.I fear that the dubious claims by this latest report simply complicate prospects for having the very important and necessary conversation about what measures California will need to take to deal with what is likely to be a steadily worsening water crisis. That is no small matter.Director of Penn State Earth System Science Center; Author of \u0027Dire Predictions\u0027 and \u0027The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars\u0027Fighting corruption is a global imperative. Today, on International Anti-Corruption Day, it is more important than ever that the international community re-affirm its collective commitment to preventing and eradicating public corruption.Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division, U.S. Department of JusticeAssistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement AffairsSomething felt terribly wrong. At first I was just a little woozy. Five minutes later I threw up Taco Del Mar all over the locker room floor, and then had the unfortunate aim of collapsing in it. It was clear that this was unlike any concussion I had received in my past.StudentWe aren\u0027t supposed to admit to caste feeling even if, in some cases, it lurks somewhere beneath the surface.Former Indian Minister of State for External Affairs; Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External AffairsLast time I checked, people in relationships, whether new or established, want to see their partners. This phenomenon can be nearly impossible while juggling work deadlines.Associate creative director, animal lover, reader, runner and a Brooklyn girl by birth—and at heart.Rubble. That\u0027s been the one constant for the Awajah family for as long as I\u0027ve known them.

The parable of Charles Dickens\u0027 \"A Christmas Carol\" springs to mind.International President, United SteelworkersI\u0027ve seen over and over, one empowered citizen journalist can truly change their world, and in an increasingly intertwined globe, everyone else\u0027s. Who makes the news is as important as what the news is.Founder of Video VolunteersYou can think of many adjectives to describe The Huffington Post and it almost always will be accurate for India as well -- vibrant, diverse, feisty, inclusive, wise and fun.Editor-in-Chief, HuffPost IndiaAt long last the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is expected to vote this week on an authorization for the use of force for the war against ISIS that started in early August. There is little doubt that a majority of the committee supports the use of force against ISIS. What will be revealed this week is what limits the committee will support in authorizing the use of force.Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicyThe ACA is far from perfect. It would have been much better to have a universal Medicare system, or at least have a public option, but it was a huge step forward not only because it insured millions of previously uninsured people but, even more importantly, because it freed tens of millions of workers from dependence on their employers for insurance.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027The parent who can come to me and sat they\u0027ve never offered their child anything as a reward for good behavior can show me their Parent of the Year certificate and I\u0027ll kiss it. I\u0027ll kiss it in my Santa boxers and my ugly Christmas sweater.Father of two and blogger at PuzzlingPosts.comIt\u0027s 2014, a black stormtrooper shouldn\u0027t be considered progress or pandering, it should be considered the norm.
