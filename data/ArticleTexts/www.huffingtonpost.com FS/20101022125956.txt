They are an eclectic mix of those accustomed to the spotlight and those who have been working under the radar. And there were more than a few surprises...Read Post | CommentsJosh Silver, 10.21.2010President, Free PressIt\u0027s no longer just about Juan Williams or NPR. We\u0027re in a moment when we have to decide: Are we going to let our news media further devolve into a morass of shouting heads, hateful rhetoric and political opportunism? Or will we build something better?Read Post | CommentsMona Gable, 10.21.2010Writer and Journalist focusing on politics and parentingI\u0027m all for more women running for office. God knows, we need more women in Congress. But when did it become acceptable for female candidates not to be smart? Or accomplished?

I Say\"It now sounds like Williams will profit handsomely from NPR\u0027s rush to judgment, but that doesn\u0027t make it right -- even for a PC liberal like me.Read Post | CommentsBrendan Nyhan, 10.21.2010Political scientist and media criticDespite the influence of the Tea Party movement, the GOP actually has more House candidates who have previously held elected office running for open seats than the Democrats do.Read Post | CommentsLee Camp, 10.22.2010Comedian featured in new bestselling book \"Satiristas!\" \u0026 www.LeeCamp.netThe following memo was found in the garbage outside of Christine O\u0027Donnell\u0027s campaign headquarters.

Wilson, 10.21.2010Founder and President of The White House ProjectOnly a critical mass of women in politics will change this focus on \"hair, hemlines and husbands\" -- unfortunately, these three words too often encapsulate the ways in which female politicians make it in the headlines.Read Post | CommentsAparna Pande, 10.21.2010Research fellow, Hudson InstituteIn the context of rumors about an impending military coup in Pakistan, Obama\u0027s unannounced meeting with the Pakistani delegation emphasizing American support for the present civilian government might be a game-changer.Read Post | CommentsNiall O\u0027Dowd, 10.21.2010Founder, IrishCentral.comWe are not perfect human beings, no matter what NPR believes.

I know I have been on both sides of the issue.Read Post | CommentsPepe Escobar, 10.21.2010Roving correspondent for the Asia TimesI was deep inside Islamophobistan - that Europe-wide arc where Islamophobia is being gleefully practiced as an electoral business of fear.Read Post | CommentsDerrick Crowe, 10.21.2010Political Director, Brave New FoundationThe New York Times just published a story that could not include more Pentagon talking points if it were written by General David Petraeus himself.Read Post | CommentsTrey Ellis, 10.21.2010Novelist, Screenwriter, and Assistant Professor at Columbia UniversityObviously not everyone, not even a majority of Tea Partiers is racist; however there is unquestionably a racist strain in that movement to which the Tea Party, the GOP and intellectual conservatives feign ignorance.Read Post | CommentsMelinda Gates, 10.21.2010Co-chair, the Bill and Melinda Gates FoundationAid is having a huge impact in poor countries, and it\u0027s an impact that will build on itself for generations. Bill and I often think if everybody could see the living proof of progress that is being made, they would be as optimistic as we are.Read Post | CommentsDennis Santiago, 10.21.2010CEO and Managing Director of IRARichard Alarcon and his colleagues on the L.A.

Tax dollars should be used to fund initiatives that take care of the needy or provide services that the private sector can\u0027t or isn\u0027t willing to provide.Read Post | CommentsBob Cesca, 10.20.2010Host of the Bob and Elvis ShowThe Republican strategy for this midterm election is simple: Treat voters like easily manipulated hoopleheads. Take Obamacare and the stimulus -- destroying America from within, right?Read Post | CommentsPaulina Porizkova, 10.21.2010SupermodelWe can call injections of foreign stuff under our skin \"having nothing done\". So what if Botox makes you look like a poorly dubbed movie?Read Post | CommentsFarihah Zaman, 10.21.2010Film Critic, Programmer, and FilmmakerBedeviled brings up some prickly questions about whether or not convention should be so easily accepted.
