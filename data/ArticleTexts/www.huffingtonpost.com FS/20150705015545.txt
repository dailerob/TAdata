{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, while the U.S. celebrates its independence, the world watches a modern Greek tragedy unfold as Greece votes on austere bailout terms imposed by the country\u0027s creditors. However the vote goes, one thing is clear: The austerity that came with the two previous bailouts has utterly broken the Greek economy. GDP has gone down nearly 30 percent. A quarter of the country is unemployed, including half of its young people. Pensions have been slashed. The health budget has been cut by 40 percent. Suicides are up 36 percent since 2008. The Troika has authored a new Greek myth -- that you can cut your way to growth. And now they\u0027re back, demanding more of what\u0027s already shattered the economy. The question is will they shatter the spirit of the Greek people? Just as we value our independence, so do the Greeks, who, after all, invented democracy. No matter the outcome of the vote, feeling some measure of control will help keep Greece\u0027s spirit alive.The attitude that Lyall adopts toward Senator Sanders is, instead, mildly and cheerfully disparaging -- affectionate, but at the proper distance of condescension; ironically agreeable, as you are allowed to be in dealing with a second cousin or an eccentric uncle who is a bit of a blowhard. Hers is not the first such article to appear on Sanders in the Times.Professor of Literature, Yale UniversityBoth sides of this debate have a point that has divided us. Maybe that\u0027s why the cliché of the \"Greek tragedy\" that the international media often uses to describe what\u0027s happening is accurate this time.Editor-At-Large, HuffPost GreeceWhite supremacy asks us, on the Fourth, to consider ourselves one American people. But this too is an injustice, because it asks many to forget the ways in which the promise of America never applied to them and still remains largely incomplete. Perpetuating the myth of American independence, while it doesn\u0027t fully apply to all, cannibalizes the very hope of full emancipation and real equality.Writer, Researcher, EducatorPlans based on common sense of purpose and partnership in problem solving are the basis for delivering the much needed change. There are many areas which should be subject to deep structural reform. The willingness has to be there from both sides.Founder of IKOS Asset ManagementProfessor at The Johns Hopkins University Advanced Academic Programs and adviser to the Kiernan GroupThe reason that we cling to Europe, the EU and the Euro despite all our suffering and however much we attribute to their poor handling of our present predicament, is that with all the disillusionment we have in the capacity of our own governments and our institutions, imperfect Europe remains our beacon of hope.Associate Professor of Environmental Economics, University of Athens.While all of what I described here remains in my memory there is only one split second incident that calls that July 4th, 1927 event to my mind.Founder, People for the American WayThe decision to hold a referendum on the creditors\u0027 proposal is the final act in a drama that started five months ago, when the new Greek government initiated a new round of negotiations with the country\u0027s creditors.Lecturer, Department of Political Science and Public Administration, National and Kapodistrian University of AthensIt\u0027s easy to laugh off Donald Trump\u0027s fact-free comments about Mexican immigrants being rapists. But there is a serious issue here, and mainstream media interviewers have neglected to ask Trump about it.Author and media criticDespite the conventional wisdom that patriotism means \"my country -- right or wrong\" and is best displayed by blind flag-waving, to many Americans patriotism means loyalty to a set of principles, and thus requires dissent and criticism when those in power violate those standards.E.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeE.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeSome territorial claims are easy. Often, however, history disdains simplicity. In this case, there is a complex mix of control, historical practice, international law and treaty. In the view of most observers, Beijing\u0027s claims are extravagant. Yet, they are not unprecedented.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteIn America, we have something called the Medal of Honor. It is a military award that is only given to the people that went above and beyond reasonable expectations of bravery to achieve something truly heroic. Here is a list of 10 of our greatest American heroes. On this 4th of July, take one of these stories and tell it to your buddies over the grill, or while waiting for the fireworks.Corruption Fighter, Activist, Candidate for CongressThe book is instructive and disturbing on many levels. First and foremost, I was struck by the arrogance and the sense of impunity with which Ally was written. No one who criticizes Israel is spared from Oren\u0027s venomous pen. Two targets receive special attention: President Obama and liberal American Jews.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027I am a native South Carolinian. Charleston is my maternal ancestral home. My great grandmother was born during slavery. My great grandfather I have been told was a plantation overseer. Never have I been more proud and more ashamed of my dueling ancestral heritages than right now.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundSteve King Wants to Impeach Supreme Court Justices; Rush Limbaugh\u0027s Butthurt Balm; Crazy Christian Facebook Lady is Crazy; and much more.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027Like the chorus of a drama played out in some ancient Athenian amphitheater, Europe\u0027s politicians and pundits chant that the Greeks deserve their fate; they violated the sacred dictum of the Gods of Finance -- that countries must not live beyond their means. Therefore, they must be punished.Jeff Faux, author of The Servant Economyit\u0027s not over. Not by a long shot. Not when conservatives are already looking for ways to chip away at marriage equality the way they whittled down reproductive rights to nothing in many states.Director of Advocacy, SPARTANow that United States and Cuba are preparing to open embassies in each other\u0027s countries, what else needs to happen to support the process of détente between the two countries?Professor, Thomas Jefferson School of LawMany people want to know more about Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders\u0027 foreign policy agenda. Yes, they say, we like what Sanders is saying about reducing extreme inequality, about reducing the political power of the billionaire class. But what about U.S. foreign policy?Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicyI\u0027m sure several of you are shaking your heads, wondering if I got the title wrong. But while American political figures officially declared their independence on July 4, 1776, winning it was another matter. And that came on a hot day in June, instead of a cold day in December.Political science professor, LaGrange College in GeorgiaIn order to act you must feel the a gap between what you have and what you want have, what is and what you want it to be. This gap creates a tension that, just like the tension between the poles of a battery, gives you the energy to act.Founder and Chairman, Conscious Business Center InternationalHere\u0027s another self-evident truth: Our servicemembers and veterans should be financially secure. No one should be expected to wage war on behalf of the United States while worrying about making their monthly payments back home.President and CEO, The PenFed FoundationWhy should you slave away in the kitchen while everyone else sips their cocktails? This year, enjoy your party (and be the star of it) with these easy and delicious recipes.Chef, Recipe Developer and Busy MomFIFA: Where morality and good sportsmanship are squeezed out and shunned at the behest of the television industry and matchday ticketing operations.I\u0027m an Editorial Fellow for Huffington Post Sports. I\u0027m also an urban ninja.We\u0027re not a perfect nation nor do we claim to be. We have much work to do on many fronts. But we\u0027re also a country that has demonstrated a willingness to grow and evolve to the benefit of our citizens. So, despite our difference let\u0027s celebrate and appreciate our Day of Freedoms.Psychotherapist, AuthorI don\u0027t want to spend my time chastising you. I\u0027ll leave that to your business partners who have the power to scold you where it hurts. Instead, I\u0027m writing to say thank you! What you did with your straight talk was send more Latino voters to the polls than several registration rallies combined!Award-Winning ActressSocial Security is as American as fireworks on the Fourth of July. This summer marks the eightieth anniversary of its enactment. To celebrate the birthday, let\u0027s do what past generations have done.Founding Co-director, Social Security WorksAt the moment, it doesn\u0027t have the means to take on the world or take over even a single country. But that could change. ISIS isn\u0027t like previous proto-states or liberation movements. It\u0027s a fundamentally different creature.Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogFor all its genuine achievements, the sad reality is that the once-proud edifice of the European Union has turned into a wobbling house of cards. What has gone wrong? Let me suggest a few of the most obvious weaknesses.Christian Author and SpeakerFalcon 9 is the third resupply mission of its kind to fail in recent months. Is it more than a failure, but also a metaphor of our times?
