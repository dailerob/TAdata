{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor at Columbia University and a Nobel Laureate in EconomicsWhen companies go bankrupt, a debt-equity swap is a fair and efficient solution. The analogous approach for Greece is to convert its current bonds into GDP-linked bonds. If Greece does well, its creditors will receive more of their money; if it does not, they will get less. Both sides would then have a powerful incentive to pursue pro-growth policies. Seldom do democratic elections give as clear a message as that in Greece. If Europe says no to Greek voters\u0027 demand for a change of course, it is saying that democracy is of no importance, at least when it comes to economics. Why not just shut down democracy, as Newfoundland effectively did when it entered into receivership before World War II? One hopes that those who understand the economics of debt and austerity, and who believe in democracy and humane values, will prevail. Whether they will remains to be seen.To hear Paul tell it, vaccines are a worthwhile preventive measure, but carry significant risks of harm -- enough to warrant spacing them out over time.

President, Writers Guild of America, East.The announcement of the restoration of relations between Cuba and the United States has provoked a resurgence in this country of a feeling lost for decades: hope.

A more accurate term would be the \"share-the-scraps\" economy. New software technologies are allowing almost any job to be divided up into discrete tasks that can be parceled out to workers when they\u0027re needed, with pay determined by demand for that particular job at that particular moment.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Governor Chris Christie today announced that his choice for Surgeon General would be \"my Auntie Ida, who always said that the best way to cure a wound is just let it dry out in the fresh air, even if the air is in Newark.\"Congressman from New York\u0027s 3rd Congressional District; Author of the book \u0027The Global War On Morris\u0027At this stage Washington has little to lose from taking China\u0027s advice on how to address Pyongyang. It is time for both the U.S. and PRC to act.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteImplying that absence of a citation in an academic journal means medical advice has no merit is a misleading premise and misses a truth that practicing physicians acknowledge -- at least half the time that we are faced with a clinical decision, strong scientific evidence is lacking.Medical editor, The Huffington Post; Founder and president, Preventive Medicine Research InstituteThe Disney outbreak could be a game-changer for those of us trying protect children with immunizations. Because suddenly, there is a vaccine-preventable disease that is spreading like wildfire -- and could be dangerous.Pediatrician, Boston Children\u0027s Hospital, Harvard Medical SchoolPETA\u0027s kill statistics for 2014 are now available.

So why hasn\u0027t there been a successful U.S. electoral countermovement along Syriza\u0027s lines? There are a number of reasons.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourIt has been shown that even seemingly inconsequential stimuli can lead to stereotype threat. Researchers found that female students who checked the gender box before taking their AP calculus exam, as students usually do, did worse than students who checked the box after.Philosopher, Scientist, and MathematicianI\u0027ve heard free speech isn\u0027t free, and Brandon Duncan, who raps as Tiny Doo, has learned that the hard way.Legal Director, ACLU of San Diego \u0026 Imperial CountiesHillary Clinton served on the board of directors of Walmart from 1986 to 1992.

It is not science\u0027s fault that these children, our fellow Americans, caught the measles. It is not their parents\u0027 fault. It is the fault of the anti-vaxxers.Pediatrician in Washington DC, member of the National Physicians AllianceReal markets do exist. There are even real markets in fantasy objects like \"derivatives.\" People are engaged all the time in competitive buying and selling; we haggle and adjust, trade goods, money, and contracts. But the \"mainstream economist\" presupposes and proselytizes about something that purports to be more than that.Political theorist - Founding Director \"Civic Inquirer\" - author of \"Civic War and the Corruption of the Citizen\" \u0026 \"Abandoned To Ourselves\"A number of labels that originally signified progressive ideas continue to be (mis)appropriated, their radical potential drained away, with the result that they\u0027re now invoked by supporters of \"bunch o\u0027 facts\" teaching or a corporate-styled, standards-and-testing model of school reform.Education expertThe specter of the Islamic State has silenced congressional criticism and marginalized anti-war voices on the outside. The looming question is whether an open-ended authorization will extend the war on terror for years to come. The most critical issues are these.Former State Senator and leader of sixties peace, justice and environmental movement. Director of the Peace and Justice Resource Center.In both parties, the first prerequisite for success in next year\u0027s White House contest will be a strong performance in the Plutocrat Primary.

Most importantly, the alternative technologies are cleaner and safer.Vice President of Research and Innovation, Singularity UniversityBut falling in love, like applying to medical school, requires a different sort of strength. It is a frightening, potentially cataclysmic leap of faith, one that could either yield exquisite or grimly embarrassing results.Student, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount SinaiFor years everyone else has been picking up the tab for big corporations because our tax system encourages them to shift jobs and profits offshore. It\u0027s time for that to end. President Obama\u0027s plan does not go nearly far enough to do that.Executive Director, Americans for Tax FairnessOn Sunday, when 3,800 members of the United Steelworkers (USW) walked off their jobs at nine oil refineries across the country (including two in my home state of California), it marked the first national oil refinery strike in more than three decades, going all the way back to 1980. Congratulations, USW. With this strike, organized labor is finally showing signs of life.Playwright and author (\"It\u0027s Never Been Easy: Essays on Modern Labor\")I am fat and I am ridiculously happy. That may just be my personality. I do not have the proverbial \"skinny girl\" inside me just dying to escape. I think that is such sad and tired cliche.
