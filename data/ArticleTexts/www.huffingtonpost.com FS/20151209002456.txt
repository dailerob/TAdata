Donald Trump is appealing to racial and religious fear and hate in order to advance his own success. But an even greater danger than Trump is the growing popular response to him, the standing ovations to his most vicious attacks on racial minorities, immigrants, and now all the members of a world religion.

That work is vitally important. But here on the ground, it\u0027s clear that another powerful force is also shaping the outcome of the talks: civil society.Former President, NRDCAppointed by President Bill Clinton, I took my oath of office to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States of America with my hands on the Quran atop my wife\u0027s Bible. It was one of the proudest moments of my life. I carried the American flag with dignity, honor and distinction.United States Ambassador from 1999-2001On December 8, finance ministers of Germany, France, and eight other eurozone countries released a one-page agreement outlining the current consensus on \"core issues.\" While important details remain, the negotiators appear to have stood up to fierce industry opposition in several key areas.IPS Global Economy Project DirectorIt\u0027s not enough for them to reject one outrageous plan.

It\u0027s directly trickling into to new legislation that Congress is currently considering -- legislation that will effectively create two classes of Americans.President, National Iranian American CouncilThe loss of confidence in government, fostered by many in government, is a more serious threat to American security than ISIS. There is no American alive today who can destroy confidence in our government and expect to restore it by being elected.United States Senator (Ret.)A true artist, music runs deep through Bocelli\u0027s veins. In this clip, he speaks on the ever-present melody that lives within his mind, body, and soul.PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorAll parents should understand the critical role that they play in shaping their students\u0027 mindset for lifelong learning and see the power of computer science to make our lives and the lives of those around us better.Director, Google K-12 Education Outreach - inspiring girls and under-represented minorities to pursue STEM/CS. g.co/cseduCreating life is not just a physiological process; as that revolutionary Jewish couple showed, every adult who decides to support new life becomes the greatest expression of the universe.Authors of Il Marito dello Sposo blogThe calculus of Trump\u0027s egregious comments is that they serve to justify the suspicions and bigotry of white supremacy in the public discourse.
