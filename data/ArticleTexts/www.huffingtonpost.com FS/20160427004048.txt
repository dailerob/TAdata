{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Novelist and contributing opinion writerIt is hard to kill off a major political party. The Republicans proved that between 1964 and 1968, rallying from the Goldwater debacle to win the presidency with Richard Nixon. But that was then, when the Democrats were riven by the war in Vietnam. Now the Democrats are having an honest fight — nasty, to be sure, but one whose premises are commonly understood: that a society does better when more of its citizens thrive, and that helping to ensure this is a legitimate concern of government. Not so the Republicans. They are structurally fragmented and ideologically incoherent, an agglomeration of sects with irreconcilable differences. Their only common denominator is that all are at war with the changing demographics which, at the presidential level, are doing the party in.It may too soon to tell, but so far North Carolina GOP governor Pat McCrory\u0027s signing of a sweeping anti-LGBT law hasn\u0027t been a great help to his re-election campaign.Queer Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostAnita Hill believed in the system and trusted the process, even though in the end it betrayed her. The Republican obstructionists today have disrespected the system, turned their back on the process, and taken the coward\u0027s way out.President, Alliance for Justice and Alliance for Justice Action CampaignBeyoncé\u0027s album is not an attack on anyone. It is a celebration of the strength, endurance and potential within black womanhood. The fact that you are mad/uncomfortable/agitated about it is evidence enough of how blind you are to the realities of being one.One of Britain’s most successful black female entertainersThis week is World Immunization Week and what better way to commemorate it than by discussing the facts about vaccines and the importance of herd immunity.Anthropologist, writer, actress, comedienne, \u0026 cartoonistWhat is remarkable about Bob McDonnell\u0027s case is not the technical arguments he makes, but the sheer brazenness with which he and many his supporters defend his conduct.Senior Counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice.Across America, men and women who were unfairly convicted languish in jails and prisons. Those cases and stories rarely receive any attention from the legal system, the media, and the public. Fortunately for Mac Phipps, the media has taken note and well-known artists have publicly offered him their support.Associate Professor of Law at the University of GeorgiaCommunity activist and Grammy-award winning rapperAssociate Professor of Liberal Arts, University of RichmondThe message at the heart of Junction 48 is that Palestinians do not need the patronizing help of Western liberals; even less do they need the silence about \"honor killing\" as part of the Western leftist\u0027s \"respect\" for Palestinian ways of life. These two aspects are the two sides of the same ideological mystification.Slovenian philosopher and psychoanalystToday, it is mostly silence that surrounds the abandoned buildings that stand as testimony to the hasty departure.Freelance Photojournalist and Documentary VideographerAfter the earthquakes, many families had no choice but to sleep out in the open. The earthquakes not only destroyed their homes and their schools, but left millions of children scared and in danger.Actor and Unicef UK ambassadorUpon arrival to The Grove in Hertfordshire, I knew something was up. Police were at the gates and more police were on the long, pastoral roadway leading into The Grove. And there was a general atmosphere that suggested something special was going on. With the regular parking lot closed, we pulled right in front. \"What\u0027s going on?\" I asked? Tight lips, no answers.CEO of Stillwell Partners and Executive Director of Advertising Week and Advertising Week EuropeAs the words of Somali poet Warsan Shire propelled the potent imagery that evoked a plethora of emotions that possessed me, ?I was haunted by the truth of who I\u0027ve been for all this time.Multimedia JournalistOn March 16, the media said it was over, and they\u0027re saying it\u0027s over now. But those who \"do their own research\" knew then that the movement had many contests left to win, and they know now that 19 states and 1,401 delegates are still available.Author, \u0027Double Happiness\u0027, aiming to make the world a better place via research, travel, and writingPolls purportedly show that a significant number of Bernie Sanders\u0027s backers say they won\u0027t vote for Clinton no matter what. Now Sanders has made it clear that he will do whatever it takes to \"make sure\" no Republican gets in the White House.Author and political analystYoung people worldwide, who have been more affected than their elders by the financial crisis, identify with one another more than they ever have in the past. They are the #StarWarsGen: just as no one cares where you are from on Endor or Coruscant in Star Wars, for these kids, being from planet earth is enough information, thank you very much.Former President, East Timor, 1996 Nobel Peace Prize laureateExecutive Director of the think tank Youthonomics and CEO of mYgrationCEO of the Stockholm Chamber of CommerceCo-founder of TibbaBernie, use this moment to mobilize your activists in states that have already had their primaries, and have that movement already happening before the Democratic convention in July. You just might find that some of those \"super-delegates\" have second thoughts if they realize that their jobs may be at stake.Editor, Tikkun MagazinePublic defenders can and do play a critical role in helping people transitioning back to the community, when provided the opportunity and funding to do so.Executive Director, National Association for Public DefenseDirector of Training and Outreach, Metropolitan Public Defender, Portland, OregonMany Jews are familiar with Maimonides\u0027 teaching that the highest level of tzedakah (charity) is to help a person gain employment so that they can have the dignity of working to support themselves. But what if full-time work paid so little that a person was denied that measure of dignity by continuing to be in need of tzedakah?Director of Bend the Arc Jewish ActionHard feelings are given a bad rap. Uncomfortable feelings -- feelings that make our bodies ache and shake and cause noises to come out of our throats, that make us again elemental -- honey, that is the stuff of life, of human person living. Do not miss out on a fundamental part of the reason you\u0027re here because you\u0027re hellbent on being comfortable.Do you sometimes talk a little bit too loud about your feelings, too? Come sit by me.Rigor. The Merriam-Webster dictionary says it means, among other things, \"an act of strictness, severity or cruelty.\" As horrible as that sounds, the word rigor has spread like a bad plague that makes up look like down.LGBT advocate, U.S. Navy Veteran and Dearborn, Mich. residentWhy does it serve United States\u0027 interests to adopt the Saudi line that Iran is an implacably hostile force that sows instability throughout the Middle East and with whom any form of normalization is dangerous?Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghIt is almost impossible for us to have meaningful tax reform, either incremental or transformative, until there is general acknowledgement that supply-side economics has not and does not work. It\u0027s time to move beyond wishful thinking and focus on what has actually happened.U.S. Representative for New York\u0027s 12th District; Ranking Democrat, Joint Economic CommitteeThere is no better candidate than Muhammad, no one in fact that comes even close, in terms of fulfilling Jesus\u0027s promise of the Spirit of Truth who would bring forth a new revelation from God.Theologian, minister, ethicist, and activist; co-founder of Common Street Spiritual Center (www.commonstreet.org)Whereas general relativity took a single genius (Einstein) a decade to create, that deeper theory -- known as a quantum theory of gravity -- has flummoxed generations of geniuses for a century.Science Journalist and AuthorHumanitarian aid rests on the belief that a crisis is a short-term event lasting days, weeks or months, not years. From Syria to Sudan, history says otherwise.Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationI love the Bern. I even feel the Bern occasionally. But I\u0027m afraid he unwittingly stumbled into a sticky Big Soda trap last week when he declined to support the soda tax that Philadelphia\u0027s popular mayor Jim Kenney is fighting for.Author, Producer, AdvocateThere are few areas where there is more bipartisan support than the need to provide adequate health care for the country\u0027s veterans. This is why it is especially annoying to see right-wing groups invent scandals around the Veteran Administration\u0027s hospitals in order to advance an agenda of privatizing the system.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027When my kids were little, people would always say, \u0027Enjoy this time. They grow up so quickly.\u0027 And, yes, they were right. But whereas days used to slip away like hours and weeks used to slip away like days, right now our months as a family unit feel as though they\u0027re slipping away like minutes.Senior Editor, The Huffington PostThe death of a celebrity like Prince evokes a response that reveals more about us than about the deceased. Our chest beating in grief is a bit self-indulgent. Cronkite was a dinosaur from the past, but one who understood this and reported accordingly, but he was probably the last one to do so.Scientist and former White House Senior Policy Analyst; Ph.D. in neurophysiologyBodies are such a gift, and the choices we make with them aren\u0027t always comfortable or easy. But they are deeply personal. To all the women out there, I hope you know: the only thing that will always be too small is the size of everyone else\u0027s perception of what your body should look like.Writer, feminist, lover of coffee and treats.This time last year, I never dreamed I\u0027d spend Mother\u0027s Day without my mom.
