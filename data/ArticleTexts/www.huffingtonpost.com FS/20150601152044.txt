{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Last week, I went back to Oberlin for my 50th Reunion (!) where much of the weekend was a celebration and retrospective of our graduation ceremony in 1965, whose commencement speaker was Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. It was one of his greatest speeches. When Dr. King was murdered, he was in the process of connecting civil rights to economic justice. Both causes represent America\u0027s terrible unfinished business. We have made halting progress on civil rights since 1965, but on economic justice America has gone almost straight backwards. One can think of many leaders who deserve our respect and our thanks, but I can\u0027t think of a single prophetic voice on a par with Martin Luther King, Jr. Dr. King was just 36 when he gave that speech. If he had lived, he would be 86 today. Imagine what his prophetic voice might have accomplished had he lived into the 21st century.Daniel Lee is a co-founder of Hush, the earplugs that block out sleep-disrupting noises while remaining wirelessly connected to your smartphone so you don\u0027t sleep through your alarm. In answer to my questions, he shared his insights on why such a product is needed, how poor sleep can affect our most important relationships, and the future of wearable technology.Six weeks ago, Northwestern University President Morton Schapiro wrote a fine op-ed in the Wall Street Journal in which he offered a ringing endorsement of academic freedom. It is therefore both surprising and disappointing that Northwestern University recently found itself embroiled in two embarrassing violations of the core principles of academic freedom.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoBrexit is not just a referendum. It is a momentous decision gambling with Britain\u0027s, England\u0027s, and Scotland\u0027s future. The question will linger for a long time: Was it worth it - were the nation and the people best served by this course of action?Author, \u0027The Global Economy in Transition\u0027I join the American family in mourning the death of former Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden to brain cancer. He was a joy to his loved ones, an advocate for our most vulnerable, and a Bronze Star Army Captain who fought for veterans and military families. Many politicians preach family values -- Beau Biden lived them.Chair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusI don\u0027t begrudge Texas billions of dollars in disaster relief. But the flow of federal money poses a bit of awkwardness for the Lone Star State. After all, just over a month ago hundreds of Texans decided that a pending Navy Seal/Green Beret joint training exercise was really an excuse to take over the state and impose martial law.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The success of the economies of these countries is not only important for their own people, but for the millions of expatriates who work there, sometimes under difficult circumstances, and who annually send $50 billion to their home countries -- making this region the largest source of remittances in the world.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Having trouble falling asleep is a real drag. Having no trouble sleeping, but being awakened with by a whispered, \"Are you asleep? I\u0027m not,\" is a reason for justifiable homicide in six states.Medical Director, Charlottesville Neurology \u0026 Sleep Medicine, sleep medicine, neurology specialistIf there is one thing I wish I knew when I was graduating from college, it\u0027s that the Delphic admonition \"Know Thyself\" and Socrates\u0027 admonition that \"the unexamined life is not worth living\" are not ancient philosophical platitudes, but in fact the most relevant and important guiding truths for our lives.Perkins, who died 50 years ago this month, is one of our nation\u0027s greatest heroines. Her remarkable life should inspire us to continue the battles she fought. Many of the issues she worked on -- including wage theft, discrimination against women workers and the rights of immigrant workers -- remain problems today. Anyone who fights for social justice stands on her shoulders.E.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeWhat if doctors could check a patient\u0027s brain vitals just as easily as taking their pulse or blood pressure? Recently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved several new technologies to help assess brain health and detect emotional and cognitive changes earlier when treatment can be most effective.Public Health Editor, The Huffington Post; Former U.S. Assistant Surgeon GeneralWhen all is said and done, we don\u0027t need scientific studies to prove to us the inestimable value of having, sustaining and sharing hope. For those of us working hard to improve our health, in spite of huge challenges, hope forms an indispensable infrastructure of internal love and support.For anyone who is interested in leading a healthful lifestyleMany women like how they look in heels. They shouldn\u0027t be made to feel as if they\u0027re abandoning the feminist cause, or kowtowing to the patriarchy if they choose to wear them. It\u0027s possible to want to wear high heels and also want equality in the workplace at the same time.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarThe leading conservative and progressive commentators on Hillary\u0027s ethics clash -- is the likely next Democratic nominee and president more motivated to make history and policy... or money? They review charges, point by point, and actually arrive at one consensus. Then: \"Who Lost China\", er, Iraq?Host, \u0027Both Sides Now\u0027So Chris Christie has decided to repudiate the Common Core. Big frickin\u0027 deal. Here are just a few of the reasons that his newly-discovered disdain for the standards is unimpressive, and unlikely to help save the fantasy of Christie running for President, ever.Teacher and writer; blogger, curmudgucation.blogspot.comWhile the news business has changed dramatically over the past six decades, there is much for all journalists to learn from Bob Schieffer\u0027s remarkable career. He hosted presidents and world leaders. He asked tough questions, but was never confrontational. He never wanted to be the story; he just wanted to cover the news.Hofstra Journalism ProfessorI like to think of this time of year as Parenting Season, the span between Mother\u0027s Day and Father\u0027s Day. It can be a challenging time for LGBTQ parents and our kids, since we don\u0027t fit into those two categories in the traditional way -- but it can also be a great time to celebrate and raise awareness about our families.Founder and publisher, MombianI was 23. I was about to get married. Then I got pregnant. In a reaction that surprised me to my very \"abortion is murder\" core, the first thought that went through my brain was \"Get an abortion.\"After Obama, it\u0027s going to be hard to sell another inexperienced candidate. Normally, Americans go for outsiders -- candidates with fresh new ideas, uncontaminated by political experience. But or the first time since 2007, a majority said experience is more important than fresh ideas in a recent CBS-Times poll.Professor, George Mason University; contributor, Al JazeeraAt a time when we should be celebrating Medicaid and CHIP successes, serious threats to Medicaid, CHIP and the ACA continue to surface in Congress. So, in addition to advocating for continuing improvements in children\u0027s health coverage, we must also play defense to protect the hard-earned gains made for children as well as adults.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundJune 2 would have been Hadiya\u0027s 18th birthday, but because of a shooting on January 29, 2013, her young life ended. She loved this city and she had dreams: dreams of going to college and of becoming a journalist--dreams of traveling the world.Father of Hadiya Pendleton, who was shot and killed on Chicago’s South Side in January 2013President, Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun ViolenceLast weekend demonstrators joined a March Against Monsanto in some 428 cities in 38 countries, including more than 240 cities in the U.S. alone. What exactly has so many people riled up? Monsanto, of course.Senior Scientist with Consumers UnionThe country is saddened, and party doesn\u0027t matter. We all share the family\u0027s loss because it can happen to any one of us. It did to me, and while I know some friends and FB acquaintances are tired of my efforts to bring child loss to the national discussion, the loss of Beau Biden compels us to talk about it.PR veteran, gadfly, troublemaker, cigar smoker, journalist and activist on behalf of bereaved parents everywhere.,Everyone in my family gave these recipes an enthusiastic thumbs-up.Chef, Recipe Developer, and Busy MomUrbex and photographer Iain Bolton offer us a haunting glimpse into the town of Pripyat, the nuclear city established in February of 1970 to support a nearby power plant you might have heard of... It was called Chernobyl.Wordsmith, photo nerd, sitcom junkie, dog lover, and Editor at 500px. Everything I ever needed to know I learned from Calvin and Hobbes.As she turns 50, Brooke Shields says she has found self-confidence. \u0027I struggled with it forever because I was always trying to navigate my mother, or the public, or people, or an image, or whatever,\u0027 she said.Global community for people over 50Daydreams have benefits. And with a little focus, you can turn them into a creative task that will help you get more done and be more inventive with everything you do. Daydream more ... with a little direction.Writer, photographer, serial entrepreneur and reinvention coachYou wouldn\u0027t think much has changed since turning 25. You would probably think the two ages are one in the same because in a way, they are (for example: lots and lots of wine). But, there are things that change at 26...Founder, ForeverTwentySomethings.comWe reached out to some of the top fitness experts and asked how they balance their exercise, health and sleep schedules both personally and for clients, and also asked them to clear up common misconceptions they see regarding rest in the fitness world. Read on to learn from some of the best in fitness.Writer, Content Manager at AmerisleepMost of us who have faced anxiety know that we should have come out with it sooner, and that doing so brings about great relief. Letting it fester and go untended is a surefire way to add fuel to the fire.Behavioral Therapist and author of Reset: Make the Most of Your StressYou know you\u0027re here for big things, right?
