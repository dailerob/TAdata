{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressIf there\u0027s one word that\u0027s become associated with Wisconsin Representative and vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan over his long tenure in Washington, D.C., it is \"serious.\" Ryan is credited, up and down, with being a \"serious\" man. His reputation for seriousness precedes him in every fresh encounter on Capitol Hill and every booking on Sunday morning\u0027s political chat shows. And more amazingly, that reputation lingers long after those encounters have ended, despite each new pile of evidence to the contrary.
