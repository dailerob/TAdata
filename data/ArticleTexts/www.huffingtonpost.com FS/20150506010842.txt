{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorTo the extent that we share national values, they tend to lean more towards equal opportunities than equal outcomes. The thing is, these two phenomena are linked, and likely not just through correlation, but through causation. That means that we can\u0027t increase opportunity without reducing inequality. Though I\u0027ve made this point a lot lately, I\u0027ve got good reason to do so. First, there is a theme, if not a meme (not totally sure of the difference; maybe the latter is a theme amplified on the internet), developing among candidates for president, especially among the many Republicans, that what matters is opportunity, not inequality. Second, the evidence keeps building for this connection.I believe strongly that it is the responsibility of women across the globe that have achieved success in the digital and IT sector to give something back. We can capture the imagination of young women and give them the confidence to believe they can create the great tech innovations that will define our future.Life Peer in the House of Lords and David Cameron\u0027s Digital AdvisorAs thoroughly disgusting and hurtful as I may find Pamela Geller\u0027s views to be, she is totally correct that neither governments nor bullets nor bombs should block access to her ignorance or our right to publicly repudiate it -- or perhaps even ignore it -- for the hate that it is.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityBritain is f*cked. Gone are the days when power was exchanged between the main political behemoths -- Labour and the Conservatives.Night Editor, The Huffington Post UKThe young people of Baltimore are human beings. They are not thugs. They are not leeches on society. They have hopes and dreams. People in Baltimore -- all of them -- are real, live human beings, with real blood flowing through their veins, who are all important to someone and loved by someone.EducatorSpurred on by powerful multinational corporations and aided by their corporate lobbyists, the administration wants Congress to sign a blank check for yet another \"free trade\" deal, with the same inadequate safeguards as previous failed deals.Chief economist, AFL-CIO; professor of econonomics, Howard UniversityResearch Prof. NYU, Pres. Emeritus, Alfred P Sloan Foundation, Former IBM SVP Science-TechFreddie Gray\u0027s homicide was not an isolated incident; it was the tipping point. That said, the question now is how to honor this truth?Associate attorney, Murphy, Falcon \u0026 MurphyHistory offers D.H. Lawrence\u0027s warning that influential people shouldn\u0027t stimulate others\u0027 \"personal, superficial, temporary desires\" but \"tell us of our own deeper desires.\" The powers that conservatives champion have been doing the former, with increasing velocity.Lecturer in Political Science, Yale UniversityEight Hundred years ago in June, King John of England signed Magna Carta, a word most English speaking peoples recognise, but what actually was it?Author and Historian; author of the acclaimed Anjou Trilogy and frequent lecturer and historical writer.Emilie\u0027s birth and Mother\u0027s Day are emotionally so connected for me. They are one and the same. I was truly blessed to have been given such a sweet angel, and since her death at Sandy Hook, I have miss her every moment of every day.Blogger, TheParkerFive and co-founder, safeandsoundschools.org and The Emilie Parker Art ConnectionI hate to think people actually believe those stereotypes, but it\u0027s likely some do. Or maybe they simply don\u0027t stop to think about how hurtful and damaging those kinds of images can be.Minister, BuxMont Unitarian Universalist FellowshipOur nation owes a great debt to the young persons and older adults who protested against acts of actual or perceived police misconduct in Baltimore, Maryland; Staten Island, New York; Tulsa, Oklahoma; Ferguson, Missouri; Cleveland, Ohio; North Charleston, South Carolina; and other cities around the country. They are the moral conscience of our nation.Diversity Visiting Professor, University of San Francisco; and Scholar Writer in Residence, MLK, Jr. Institute, Stanford UniversityThe bottom line is that the Republican budget fails to support families trying to create a better life for themselves and their children. It will exacerbate the economic hopelessness that is fueling unrest throughout the country rather than alleviate it.U.S. Senator from CaliforniaThere\u0027s no telling what sort of blood lust this whole Bernie Sanders situation could unleash in our household and I\u0027m betting your family is struggling with the same sense of unease. I\u0027ve put together some answers to use when fielding common questions from your kids.Writer. Creative Director. Hates the cold. Not a fan of humidity. Neutral on cow manure. But loves Vermont. I don\u0027t get it either.On August 11, 2015 I plan to be on the starting line of the PepsiCo TransRockies Ultramarathon event, a multi-day trail run that covers 56 miles and nearly 9,000 feet of elevation gains. This is a formidable challenge for most people, let alone for a Stage IV lung cancer survivor.Founder, Supportersize; the one hundred 2015 honoreeIt\u0027s likely that had I any dedication and fitness ethic I would try SoulCycle again and again, til I grew numb to the pain. Maybe I could get used to the endless pedaling and the silliness of throwing my body around on a stationary bike.#1 most read free daily nationwideEven if the folks at D.A.R.E. somehow did not realize that this was likely, at best, a satire site, any qualified drug educator should know that the information about marijuana contained in the article is not even close to accurate.California Policy Manager, Drug Policy AllianceDudes are allowed to have \"dadbods\" and be seen as cute for it precisely because their worth isn\u0027t as intrinsically tied to their appearance the way a woman\u0027s worth is.Writer and blogger, The Adventures of Ernie BuffloMore than half the nation\u0027s Fortune 500 companies are incorporated in Delaware. So Delaware corporate law affects everyone. A recent case kicked off the need to recalibrate Delaware law. Here\u0027s what happened.President, Alliance for Justice and Alliance for Justice Action CampaignFollowing the most recent work stoppage by port truck drivers in southern California, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti announced the formation of a new employee-owned trucking company, which will be a model for good pay and protecting the environment. The announcement takes the port drivers\u0027 ongoing protest of low wages and exploitative working conditions to a new level.Senior Fellow, Roosevelt Institute; author of \u0027Fighting for Our Health\u0027This week marks the fifth anniversary of the flash crash. For those who don\u0027t remember, the Flash Crash was when the stock market lost almost nine percent of its value from its opening level, with most of this decline occurring in a five-minute period.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027I walked into my classroom this morning a bit groggy and bleary-eyed from a terrific weekend -- a weekend not spent grading or lesson planning, but instead, spent with my daughter on a surprise early Mother\u0027s Day weekend visit.Mother, teacher, writerThe more active America\u0027s foreign policy, the more the U.S. has to spend on the military: the \"defense\" budget is the price of Washington\u0027s foreign policy. American military personnel and contractors die. Enemies are created. A national security state develops.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteI don\u0027t love why Planned Parenthood exists. I don\u0027t love that too many states allow legislators to restrict women\u0027s health. What I love is the dedicated staff of people who are doing the ministry of caring for people. \"Care. No matter what.\" Those are words to live by. As a Christian, I say it proudly: I love Planned Parenthood.Pastor, parent, partner, and pro-alliterationistSocial anthropologist Janine Wedel, author, most lately, of Unaccountable: How Elite Power Brokers Corrupt Our Finances, Freedom, and Security, has spent decades getting to the bottom of how powerful people wield influence. Truth and transparency, she warns, have devolved into a performance art.Author and cultural theoristI always loved fashion but never really thought about a career in it. Building a business takes dedication and lots of time management. I ran my business entirely from my home for the first five years. As we\u0027ve grown to over 110 employees, I can honestly say I\u0027ve done every single job in our organization at some point.Linda’s Stuff is the leader in luxury consignment.I have experienced many moments of gratitude that have changed my life. Yet as I reflect on these moments, one stands out: a moment in the classroom that changed the way I look at my \"problems.\"Teacher and Author, \u0027Gratitude: A Way of Teaching\u0027Mr. Walker became my father away from home. He would give us weekly speeches telling us that we don\u0027t have to be products of our environments -- on welfare, using drugs or spending a life in prison. Mr. Walker always told us we could do anything and be anyone we wanted.EducatorI firmly believe that without Lisa, the negative education statistics that plague Latino communities would have become my sobering reality. Instead, Lisa was one of the first people who recognized my potential and instilled in me a passion for learning.Associate Editor to Arianna HuffingtonAs long as people like Sens. Ron Johnson and Ted Cruz are working against LGBT equality, none of us should be giving them any cover, let alone raising money for them. We surely don\u0027t have the luxury to join them on other issues with which some of us may agree, not when they\u0027re trying to make us second-class citizens. And that\u0027s why the boycott against the hoteliers is so important.Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesThis may sound confusing, but it\u0027s really quite simple. We are not our symptoms. So why should we let them define us? Mindfulness gives us the power to view these symptoms as an observer rather than an active participant.
