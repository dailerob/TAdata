President, Writers Guild of America, East.How long will we allow the climate deniers the prominence and weight that lets them give our political leaders cover to run and hide from reality? Two men in Massachusetts decided: No longer. This past May, they used their lobster boat to block a coal freighter from docking at a Massachusetts power station. They turned themselves in and faced charges that could have resulted in two years in jail and thousands of dollars in fines. But last week, the local district attorney stood on the courthouse steps and announced that he had dropped the criminal charges. \"Climate change is one of the gravest crises our planet has ever faced,\" he said. \"In my humble opinion, the political leadership on this issue has been gravely lacking.\" He then announced his intention to be at the People\u0027s Climate March in New York.Why does the world seem to celebrate schmoozers, and what might we be missing when we assume quieter people have nothing worth saying? This persuasive talk from author (and self-proclaimed introvert) Susan Cain will leave you questioning your assumptions about what makes a good leader, and you may see the people in your life a bit differently - yourself included.\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"Regardless of the soundness of the president\u0027s strategy, to ensure greater success in defeating ISIS, three distinct interlinked aspects must be factored in. Acting accordingly will permanently degrade ISIS and prevent it from rising again to pose a serious threat to our allies in the Middle East and Western security in the future.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUI\u0027ve often said on my show that domestic violence is a silent epidemic. Right now, in the aftermath of the NFL controversy surrounding several players\u0027 involvement in domestic abuse cases, it\u0027s anything but silent. We have arrived at a teachable moment in America for children and adults.Author, Host \"Dr. Phil\"These days, the barrier to advancing is more likely to be self-constructed. That\u0027s right: Your own worst workplace nemesis is you.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarSaying \"yes\" to her often means saying \"no\" to him -- or forcing him to watch from the sidelines. Saying \"no\" to both seems easier -- more fair -- though I am now seeing that it is the former rather than the latter.Writer, SAHM, CMO - Chief Medical Officer (of my family), Wife, www.JamieKrugAuthor.comThis sends a very clear message to children in this country, boys in particular, who aspire to be athletes, or those who simply see these athletes as role models. The time has come to flip that message and make it one of zero tolerance.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersScotland\u0027s independence vote has been cast, and its citizens chose overwhelmingly to remain part of Great Britain. But this historic vote should be studied by all those who want to affect political and economic change around the world, because there are important lessons to be learned.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourAs we celebrate the rascally Murray\u0027s 64th birthday, let\u0027s take a quick look at some roles he missed or passed on, and wonder what might have been.Editor, bestmoviesbyfarr.comPatriarchy makes good use of the issue of privacy. Behind that curtain -- or those elevator doors -- it can still swagger and intimidate and hurt. Then, if the victim refuses to press the case, the state is reluctant to intervene.Novelist, commentator and essayistIt is a moral disgrace that child poverty in the U.S. is higher than adult poverty, higher than for children in almost all other competitor nations, and higher than our country with the world\u0027s largest economy should ever allow.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundThis has nothing to do with privacy. I\u0027m so tired of people blabbering on about how we need to respect people\u0027s privacy. Sexuality shouldn\u0027t be a private matter. It certainly isn\u0027t for straight people.Executive Editor, HuffPost Gay VoicesIt\u0027s so important for girls and teens to develop the courage and self-esteem to know that they can accomplish anything they want in life, and I hope that through my continued work with Girl Scouts of the USA, we can help enable girls across the country to reach their full potential.Philanthropist, Author, EntrepreneurFor almost everybody in Scotland the referendum vote is seen as not the end of the matter; the key question is, \"What now?\"Chair of the Centre for Scottish Public Policy \u0026 Professor of Management at Queen Margaret University, EdinburghIn the difficult aftermath of extreme weather events, higher rates of physical violence against women also often occur, notably in two of the most economically developed countries in the world: the United States and Australia.Polar explorer and climate change campaignerFrench Jews certainly have had enough of all this. Are we still at home, they ask themselves, in this strange country where the vilest anti-Zionism, the stubbornest Holocaust denial, and the murkiest competition for victimhood are combining to produce a new and potentially devastating form of anti-Semitism?Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.There is here, surely, a delicious irony in Obama and Kerry taking upon their shoulders the task of seeking the \"delegitimization\" of the very doctrine from which the Saudi kingdom is derived.Fmr. MI-6 agent; Author, \u0027Resistance: The Essence of Islamic Revolution\u0027The first major choice students make is in selecting their college, and it\u0027s clear some campuses offer a better shot at fitness success than others.www.theactivetimes.comOur colleges and universities aspire to help students to find what John Dewey called \"the large and human significance\" in their lives and work. This requires not just teaching to the test and not just parroting critiques. It requires learning to think with contexts and concepts, deploying cooperation and creativity.President, Wesleyan UniversityThe scientific debate about whether human-caused global warming exists is long over. The remaining window of time for the needed transformation is short, and the only real issue is how we respond. This is where U. S. leadership is most critical.Director of Penn State Earth System Science Center; Author of \u0027Dire Predictions\u0027 and \u0027The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars\u0027Professor of Energy, University of California, Berkeley; ECPA Fellow, U.S. Secretary of StateThe only thing keeping the Republicans in the game is the Kochs and their big-money friends dumping hundreds of millions of dollars into the pot, and McConnell and other party leaders know it.Co-Founder, Democracy PartnersIn the past year and a half, I\u0027ve given over 100 keynote speeches and hundreds of presentations, and things have changed dramatically. I still get nervous occasionally, but public speaking is now one of my favorite activities. Here are the five steps that have been most helpful in reducing my anxiety.Wharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027It\u0027s worth remembering these days -- as President Obama declares that air power will be the primary and perhaps only U.S. effort against ISIS in Iraq and Syria -- that the impressive Pentagon videos of missile warheads exploding in the crosshairs obscure the difficulty that air power has in achieving positive, lasting effects on the ground.Senior Military Correspondent, The Huffington PostAn extraordinarily stressful experience, such as war captivity in early adulthood, can reverberate throughout a lifetime and influence later well-being, but many factors shape the outcome.Author, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027Homes keep getting bigger while our buying power gets smaller and smaller. Maybe it\u0027s time to respect the \"old\" in our lives -- starting with our living spaces.Executive Editor, HuffPost HomeRunner or non-runner, whichever you call yourself, I\u0027ve been there. And I think I\u0027ve finally figured out that whole label thing. When running is fun -- when, even when it\u0027s hard, it comes easy -- that\u0027s when you feel like a runner.Vegan marathoner; Author, \u0027No Meat Athlete\u0027By invoking Shylock, the villain of The Merchant of Venice, Biden trafficked in one of the most insidious stereotypes about Jews, that the people of the book are unethical money lenders.Author, journalist and mental health activistThousands of union members will link arms with environmental activists, to demand action from global leaders to reverse the effects of climate change. At first, that might seem strange -- the labor movement and environmentalists are not often characterized as natural allies.President, 1199 SEIU United Healthcare Workers EastAuthor of a dozen books, including \u0027The End of Nature\u0027 and \u0027Deep Economy\u0027Psychologist Abraham Maslow famously quipped, \"If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.\" It\u0027s the nature of American leadership: we hold the largest hammer in the world.Berkeley writer, retired Silicon Valley executiveWhen you\u0027re looking at it, keep in mind that the Mayo Clinic says 400mgs of caffeine per day is safe.Everything worth caring about in food, drink, and travelWhile some households and neighborhoods have recovered from the recession, most black and Latino households and neighborhoods are still waiting to recover.Law professor at UT-Austin and author of \u0027Homeownership and America\u0027s Financial Underclass\u0027Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"THEY KNEW",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
