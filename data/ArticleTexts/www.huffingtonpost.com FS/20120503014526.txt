{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editorial Director, AOL Huffington Post Media GroupJust because you can take things over the top -- and the Obama administration\u0027s made-for-tv events today are just that -- it doesn\u0027t mean that you should. Barack Obama promised to be a new and different kind of politician. If any further proof was needed that he isn\u0027t, this week -- with Bill Clinton\u0027s testimonial to his courage under fire, and with unsubtle attacks on Romney\u0027s manhood, not to mention common sense -- should finally be enough. But, in another sense, Obama is a new and different kind of politician. He\u0027s a Democrat executing the GOP media playbook better than Bush did.Read Post | Comments (1,629)Bob Cesca, 05/02/12Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez Show, Media ProducerRegarding the campaign commercial, yes -- more like that, please. It\u0027s an important distinction that\u0027s crying out to be defined: while the Republicans might be good at coming up with scary bumper sticker slogans, the Obama team can actually do the job.Read Post | Comments (613)Lisa Gittens-Williams, M.D., 05.02.2012Associate Professor, Obstetrics, Gynecology and Women\u0027s Health, UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical SchoolNearly one out of every six African-American babies in the United States is born premature. In Newark, New Jersey it\u0027s one in five. I am a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, and every day I see women who are at risk of delivering early.Read Post | Comments (4)Michelangelo Signorile, 05/02/12Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay Voices; SiriusXM radio hostWhy is Richard Grenell\u0027s resignation a win? Because Grenell was being used for cover by a candidate with abhorrently anti--gay positions, a man who has promised to \"propose and promote\" a federal marriage amendment if elected president.Read Post | Comments (60)Arianna Huffington, 05/01/12The Obama administration has every reason to celebrate the anniversary of Osama bin Laden\u0027s killing, as does the country. Less laudable is Obama\u0027s attack ad questioning whether Mitt Romney would have made the same call to go after the man behind the 9/11 attacks.Read Post | Comments (1,420)Cenk Uygur, 05/02/12Host, \u0027The Young Turks\u0027For the love of God, stop doing \"he said, she said\" crap that doesn\u0027t actually deliver the news to anyone. Democrats said this and Republicans said that -- who cares? What is the reality?! Your job is supposed to be to bring us facts.Read Post | Comments (180)Cesar Millan, 05/02/12Dog Whisperer and CEO of CesarsWay.comStray and abandoned dogs are reproducing faster than we can find homes for them, and if spaying and neutering doesn\u0027t increase dramatically, we are going to see the problem get completely out of control.Read Post | Comments (34)Doug Bandow, 05/02/12Senior Fellow at the Cato InstituteRon Paul and Gary Johnson should run together for the Libertarian Party nominations for president and vice president, respectively. That wouldn\u0027t guarantee their selection. However, Paul-Johnson would be the strongest ticket the LP could offer. It would be the best alternative available to the Republicrats.Read Post | CommentsKatie Halper, 05/02/12Co-founder, Laughing LiberallyRead Post | CommentsAlison DeNisco, 05/02/12JournalistThe first time I read the now-famous sex letter she sent me, I was shocked and amused at her amazing openness and took it as a gesture of love. She truly wanted to help guide me in the only way she knew how.Read Post | Comments (26)Russell Simmons, 05/02/12Founder, GlobalGrind.comOur democracy has been hijacked. The corporations and special interests pay our politicians to do their bidding instead of the people\u0027s. This legal bribery has to stop.Read Post | Comments (25)Leigh Steinberg, 05/02/12Sports agentI knew Junior Seau since the day in 1990 when he and his friends partied back stage after he was drafted.

It seems that Mitt Romney has outsourced this task to Ed Conrad, one of his former partners at Bain Capital.Read Post | CommentsSteven Strauss, 05/02/12Advanced Leadership Fellow, Harvard UniversityWe may yet need to intervene militarily in Syria, because of our strategic interests or to prevent genocide. But for the sakes of the American and Syrian people, military intervention should be our last resort -- we should learn the lessons of Iraq.Read Post | CommentsSoraya Chemaly, 05/02/12Feminist, Satirist and Media CriticEvery 90 seconds, somewhere in the world, a woman dies from a pregnancy-related complication. This isn\u0027t just a \"third world\" problem. The United States currently ranks 50th in the world for maternal health. It is safer to give birth in Bosnia or Kuwait than in California.Read Post | CommentsMichael Brooks, 05/01/12Science ColumnistSometimes doing something stupid or undignified is the only way to make the discovery or breakthrough you have been reaching towards. Sure, you might break a taboo or two, and you\u0027ll almost certainly break the rules, but since when did playing safe win anyone a Nobel Prize?Read Post | CommentsDennis A. Henigan, 05/02/12Vice President, Brady Campaign; Author, \u0027Lethal Logic\u0027In a real sense, Trayvon Martin\u0027s death at the hands of George Zimmerman exposes the mythology of the NRA\u0027s core narrative about guns and self-defense.Read Post | Comments (132)Ann Brenoff, 05/02/12Senior Writer, The Huffington PostWeight slips on with great ease when you are middle aged and getting it off requires a whole new arsenal of willpower weaponry. I\u0027ve approached dieting as an all-or-nothing mandate: Once I fall off the wagon, it\u0027s just too hard for me to crawl my way back on -- especially now that I\u0027m post-60.Read Post | Comments (41)The Los Angeles Public Library, 05/02/12Read Post | CommentsRichard N. Haass, 05/02/12President, Council on Foreign RelationsPast sacrifice is a poor justification for continued sacrifice unless it is warranted.

Krishnamurti and the Oak Grove School\u0027My friend Marilyn recently adopted a beautiful cat, all white, with deep blue eyes. The cat loves to gaze at herself in the floor-length mirrors on Marilyn\u0027s closet doors. What does she see? Is she admiring her own beauty? Or is she fascinated by the sight of what she thinks is another cat?Read Post | CommentsBrandon L. Garrett, 05/02/12Roy L. and Rosamond Woodruff Morgan Professor of Law, University of VirginiaCorporations can be prosecuted as criminals and every year some get convicted of crimes. However, over the past decade the government has not stepped up corporate crime enforcement. In fact, the evidence is to the contrary.Read Post | Comments (65)Elizabeth Kantor, 04/30/12Author of The Jane Austen Guide to Happily Ever AfterSurely the most benighted pre-liberation \u002750-style womanhood couldn\u0027t be any more humiliating than the conditions that liberated modern women routinely tolerate today.Read Post | Comments (16)Jag Davies, 05/02/12Publications Manager, Drug Policy AllianceThe continued decline in teen cigarette smoking is great news -- not just because it\u0027s the most deadly drug but also because it reveals that legal regulation and honest education are more effective than prohibition and criminalization.Read Post | CommentsKevin O\u0027Brien, 05/02/12vice president of business development, UBM Studios, MilicruitThe Friday before Mother\u0027s Day each year is known as Military Spouse Appreciation Day. Like me, I would imagine those reading this would agree that everyday should be Mothers Day, and everyday should also be a day where we appreciate and recognize military spouses.Read Post | CommentsRichard Kirsch, 05/02/12Senior Fellow, Roosevelt Institute; author of \u0027Fighting for Our Health\u0027Unlike most advocates for economic justice or democracy who have separated the issues, the Occupiers got this right.
