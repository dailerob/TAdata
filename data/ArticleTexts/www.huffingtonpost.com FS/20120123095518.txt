{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Bonjour! Le Huffington Post, an international collaboration bringing together Le Monde, Les Nouvelles Éditions Indépendantes, and the Huffington Post Media Group\u0027s signature mix of news, blogging, community, and social engagement, arrives today. While we will be importing the platform, technology, and tools from across the pond, Le Huffington Post will be rooted in French culture and will reflect France\u0027s own unique personality, rich culture, and diversity of voices. And it will do so at a time when France\u0027s fortunes, challenges, and decisions are of great consequence not only to the people of France but to all of Europe and the world beyond. For me, today\u0027s launch is the culmination of a lifetime of loving France and I\u0027m delighted to invite readers in France and French speakers throughout the world -- as well as those who care about its people, issues, and rich culture -- to join the conversation.Read Post | Comments (139)Anne Sinclair, 1/23/12Editorial Director, Le Huffington PostLe Huffington Post will be a place to celebrate, debate, argue, imagine and inform.

We hope these rumors are untrue.Read Post | Comments (118)Chris Kelly, 1/22/12Writer, \u0027Real Time with Bill Maher\u0027I don\u0027t know why Mitt Romney treats his tax returns like Nixon treated running a burglary ring, but I have a theory, and if I\u0027m right, someone should keep pushing.Read Post | Comments (150)Jedediah Purdy, 1/22/12Professor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027By all means, let\u0027s keep arguing about the morality of Bain Capital. But let\u0027s ask questions that give us answers we can use.Read Post | Comments (78)Richard (RJ) Eskow, 1/22/12Consultant, Writer and Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureThe State of the Union address offers President Obama perfect chance for a home run. There\u0027s no better way for the president to start the year than with a vigorous, unambiguous defense of Social Security -- and Medicare, too.Read Post | Comments (24)Cecile Richards, 1/22/12President, Planned Parenthood Action FundLast year, anti-women\u0027s health politicians across the country launched what was surely the most aggressive assault on women\u0027s rights since the Roe decision was handed down.Read Post | Comments (17)Paul Abrams, 1/22/12Last person on Earth not on FacebookThe president should tell us, as is true, that the state of the nation in 2012 is \"better\" than it was when he took office.Read Post | Comments (20)Pat Gallagher, 1/22/12Freelance WriterOne day, young ladies -- somewhere between the age of 50 and 65 -- you will be wearing my grandmother\u0027s panties. I promise.Read Post | Comments (26)Steven Strauss, 1/22/12Advanced Leadership Fellow, Harvard UniversityLike all Americans, I yearn for a simplified tax code, but Grover Norquist\u0027s misleadingly-named Americans for Tax Reform has absolutely nothing to do with tax reform.Read Post | Comments (38)HuffPost Radio, 1/22/12Spitzer and Matalin debate Romney\u0027s taxes, Gingrich\u0027s racial coda and the key to Keystone. Can Mitt alter his image with a 30 minute national address on \"the moral basis of capitalism\"?Read Post | CommentsLinda Milazzo, 1/22/12Participatory journalist and educatorAfter seventeen debates, all led by journalists, who for the most part don\u0027t represent the populations at-risk if any of these four are elected, isn\u0027t it time to have a representative panel do the grilling?Read Post | CommentsDavid Paul, 1/22/12President, Fiscal Strategies GroupThere are many participants involved, and each has their own set of metrics for a successful outcome of the Greece workout.Read Post | CommentsJon-Christopher Bua, 1/22/12Sky News White House CommentatorSuffering the chants of \"Newt Can Win\" and \"USA USA\" all the commentators who thought South Carolina would hand Mitt Romney the brass ring and a ticket to ride to the nomination -- it\u0027s time to eat crow!Read Post | CommentsTom Doctoroff, 1/22/12CEO, JWT North AsiaTo the Chinese, materialism is not superficial.
