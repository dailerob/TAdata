{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jason LinkinsEditor, Eat the PressLast night, the exemplar of politesse that is the Anthony Weiner mayoral campaign took a turn that we should have perhaps expected, when his communications director, Barbara Morgan, blasted one-time Weiner intern-turned-scoop purveyor Olivia Nuzzi with a litany of eye-popping obscenities. Morgan made these remarks to TPM reporter Hunter Walker, after Nuzzi\u0027s insider-look at the Weiner campaign made the cover of the New York Daily News. As often is the case when a string of newsmaking vulgarities come stumbling into our lives, newspapers covering the story were faced with the challenge of presenting the remarks to their readerships of ostensible adults. Some of the terms deployed by Morgan were words whose usage in print have long been governed by the vagaries of internal style guides. But Morgan, momentarily confusing the person under whom she works with a person she supervised, also referred to Nuzzi as a \"slutbag.\"Comments (180)Bob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowTed Nugent and Rand Paul aren\u0027t joking. They\u0027re playing the same old Republican game: do and say a lot of peculiar things, then later insist that it never happened and hope that no one fact-checks any of it.CommentsSocial SmurfSocial Media Blogger, SmurfEveryone\u0027s got favorite users they follow on Facebook, Instgram, and Twitter!

A recent study showed that those who had genetic changes in a hormone called ghrelin consumed more sugar (and alcohol) than those that had no gene variation.Comments (145)John GlaserEditor at Antiwar.comDid Manning break the law? According to the letter, yes he did. But since when did we presume to hold people in government accountable to the law?Comments (442)QuoraConnecting you to everything you want to know aboutEach person (and other animal) exudes a cocktail of carbon dioxide and other emanations, and we also emit heat. Mosquitoes may discern any of us as human beings, but some of us will have a more attractive signature than others.Comments (27)Michael MooreOscar and Emmy-winning DirectorBradley Manning was convicted on 20 of 22 counts, including violating the Espionage Act, releasing classified information and disobeying orders. That\u0027s the bad news. The good news is he was found not guilty on the charge of \"aiding the enemy.\" That\u0027s \u0027cause who he was aiding was us, the American people. And we\u0027re not the enemy. Right?Comments (687)John PavleyCTO @ The Huffington Post, BloggerFacebook has been criticized as a \"walled garden.\" Embedded Posts break through the wall so that public posts are available on the open Internet, where the Huffington Post and the majority of journalists and bloggers live.CommentsNarges BajoghliDocumentary Filmmaker and Ph.D. Candidate in Anthropology at NYUI could not believe that the best birth control left in Iran -- an Iran whose pharmaceutical market has been decimated by sanctions -- were the same pills facing court action and considered a serious health threat in the United States.Comments (527)Jeff MadrickRoosevelt Institute Senior Fellow; author, \u0027Age of Greed\u0027Though some have claimed Larry Summers\u0027s views on monetary policy are unclear, his time in public service reveals a history of accommodating Wall Street over Main Street.CommentsVictor ChanAuthor, \u0027The Wisdom of Compassion\u0027For the Dalai Lama, meditation is like brushing his teeth.

LewisGordon McKay Professor of Computer Science at Harvard and Fmr. Dean of Harvard CollegeSummers should not be given another role in which his self-importance can threaten the welfare of the people he should be serving. He has proved too many times that he cannot stop playing to win the smartness game, no matter how great the risk of collateral damage.Comments (17)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorWhile the reformers are running around trying to get folks excited about tax expenditures (the price), government (the product) is increasingly dysfunctional.Comments (33)Carla MolinaWriterI tell them if they like princesses, choose the ones with admirable qualities.

None of this putting your life on hold until prince charming comes around.Comments (257)Mike RyanSenior Entertainment Writer, The Huffington PostWe\u0027ve seen Lorne Michaels pull off miracles to save the show in the past. No miracles will be needed this season. \"SNL\" is in good shape -- great shape, even.

GoodmanExecutive Business Editor, The Huffington PostThe president visited an Amazon warehouse on the city\u0027s industrial periphery to spotlight a hopeful surge in recent hiring, part of his campaign to urge job creation as the fix for middle class decline. But the first part of landing a job is getting to the workplace.Comments (1,627)Bianca BoskerExecutive Tech Editor, The Huffington PostIn contrast to an earlier generation that experimented with spouse-swapping, group sex and free-love communes in the 1960s and \u002770s, today\u0027s online generation is embracing sex with no one.Comments (310)ThrillistWe\u0027re a quick, free, daily e-mail ...After investigating the constitution of the nation\u0027s most-consumed coffees, we found this truth to be self-evident: all cups of Joe are not created equal.Comments (29)Lauren DucaFellow, The Huffington PostSo many girls \"just want a gay best friend,\" and can you blame them? Why shouldn\u0027t all ladies want a man who will just listen and go shopping but isn\u0027t a total betch like their girlfriends are can be? The thing is that grouping all gay men into this \"gay best friend\" bundle counts as stereotyping.CommentsBernard-Henri LévyFrench philosopher and writerWhat about the plan for a moderate Islamist government, the idea of an Islamist succession that would not become just another form of despotism? Whatever happens next in Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood has buried that idea.Comments (79)Sonal ShahSenior Fellow, Case FoundationAs I sit here at this gathering, I see that we each in our own ways are doing BIG things to move small mountains. Yet, I can\u0027t seem to get over the nagging feeling that there must be more. Sure we can have 1000 successes, but is that enough? Will each of these individual efforts be enough to create the tipping point?CommentsRichard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureSure, they still need scapegoats they can indict instead of Wall Street executives. But America doesn\u0027t want to see television\u0027s too-good-to-be-true housewife take the fall anymore -- not when it can get a caricaturishly bad one instead.

First, that\u0027s not at all what happened, as these shows will land elsewhere.Comments (454)Jacob TomskyWriter, hospitality veteran, and author of HEADS IN BEDS, now in trade paperback.It\u0027s impossible to explain all that happens or can be learned from working in a hotel. Because everything that can happen in the world happens in hotels.
