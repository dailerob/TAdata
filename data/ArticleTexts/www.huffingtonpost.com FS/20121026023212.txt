{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupPresidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton are turning into the most watchable buddy-buddy road show since \"Starsky and Hutch.\" All they\u0027re missing are platform shoes and a Gran Torino. Next week they will travel together to Florida, Ohio and Virginia, as Clinton tries to infuse his explanatory magic into Obama\u0027s campaign-trail pitch in the final days of a grueling 2012 race.
