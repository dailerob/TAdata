{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The same diligent workers who earned decent wages a couple of generations ago are now working just as hard for a lot less. The fact is, American productivity has nearly doubled in a generation. The problem is that the fruits of that productivity have gone to the wrong people.

It is hard to swallow the idea that today\u0027s one percent has higher skills and somehow earned these astronomical rewards.
