{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week saw President Obama take his anemic case for military strikes against Syria to Congress. Just how anemic was made clear on Monday as Secretary of State Kerry ominously warned that the U.S. was facing a \"Munich moment.\" It was a comparison every bit as absurd and insulting as the \"mushroom cloud\" metaphor brandished by Condoleezza Rice and President Bush in the fall of 2002. But this time the fear-mongering fell flat, as the Coalition of the Unwilling continued to grow throughout the week. In response, the president announced he would speak to the country on Tuesday, to \"make the best case that I can to the American people.\" A good start would be jettisoning the over-the-top scare tactics. Addressing the overwhelming unpopularity of the proposed strikes, the president declared \"these kinds of actions are always unpopular, because they seem distant and removed.\" But he got it backwards. The unpopularity is precisely because the blowback from poorly-conceived military actions no longer seems distant or removed.Comments (541)Doug BandowSenior Fellow, the Cato InstituteThe president has placed the decision whether to go to war where it belongs, with Congress. Legislators should act on behalf of the American people, not the Obama administration. And the right decision is to keep the U.S. at peace.Comments (62)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027When a head of state is responsible for the deaths of 100,000 of his people and has used chemical weapons against innocent civilians -- the world needs to respond. Doing nothing is not an option. But how should we respond, and what are moral principles for that response?Comments (749)Oprah WinfreyChairman and CEO, Oprah Winfrey NetworkYears ago, my friend and trainer Bob Greene said to me, \"Hawaii is one of the best places on Earth to live.\" I discovered he was right. There\u0027s a reason it\u0027s often called paradise. I am blessed that for at least two months out of the year (working on three) I get to call it home.Comments (250)George LakoffAuthor, \u0027The Political Mind,\u0027 \u0027Moral Politics\u0027 and \u0027Don\u0027t Think of an Elephant!\u0027President Obama has reframed his position on Syria, adjusting the Red Line metaphor: It wasn\u0027t his Red Line, not his responsibility for drawing it. It was the Red Line drawn by the world, by the international community -- both legally by international treaty, and morally by universal revulsion against the use of poison gas by Assad.Comments (501)Arianna HuffingtonAloha!

Just when I was finding the courage to discuss the darkest moment in my life, we were literally plunged into darkness together.Comments (108)John KerryU.S. Secretary of StateI\u0027m sometimes asked how, as someone who testified 42 years ago against the Vietnam War in which I had fought, I could testify in favor of action to hold the Assad regime accountable today. The answer is, I spoke my conscience in 1971 and I\u0027m speaking my conscience now in 2013.Comments (2,223)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundFar too many young Black boys are only hearing the first part of the message - -\"You can\u0027t do it.\" We need supports in place to show them that they can choose a different path.Comments (58)Luis Moreno OcampoFormer Chief Prosecutor, International Criminal CourtThe Syrian conflict offers the world an opportunity: to find an innovative response to establish global order.Comments (400)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarThink hard: When\u0027s the last time you took credit -- really took credit -- for a job well done?

Only a decade later, that broke graduate student and his family have not only established themselves successfully and put their roots in this beautiful country, but more importantly, we feel more at home here in the U.S. than anywhere else in the world.Comments (196)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistWhen I was a kid, nobody set a table or stocked a pantry like my Mom. As a true Sicilian, her love of food was matched only by her keen sense of display. She always said, \"The eyes eat before the stomach.\" And all these years later, I can still picture what our kitchen looked like every year at this time: big bowls and platters everywhere, filled with the season\u0027s fresh harvest of brightly colored fruits and vegetables.CommentsLord David OwenFmr. British foreign secretaryIf the proposition to withdraw all chemical weapons were agreed, it would almost certainly be sufficient to bring about an accompanying ceasefire. It would also be an impetus to start the planned conference in Geneva to negotiate a peace settlement.Comments (176)Marisa McPeck-StringhamBlogger, Iron DaisyI know your family would not be thrilled at the thought of my teenage daughter seeing you only in your towel. Did you know that once a female sees you in a state of undress, she can\u0027t ever un-see it? You don\u0027t want my daughter to only think of you in this sexual way, do you?Comments (905)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorNow, as if having learned nothing from the devastating and costly aftermaths of the military invasions of Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya, you\u0027re beating the combustible drums to attack Syria -- a country that is no threat to the U.S. and is embroiled in complex civil wars under a brutal regime.Comments (847)Kateri AllardRegistered nurseI am a nurse. I didn\u0027t become a nurse because I couldn\u0027t cut it in med school or failed organic chemistry, but rather because I chose this. This wasn\u0027t my plan B. It was my plan A.Comments (174)Medea BenjaminCo-founder, CODEPINK: Women for PeaceThe clock is ticking, with President Obama and Secretary Kerry frantically selling a war that the American people don\u0027t want to buy. If Congress goes ahead and approves military action, they -- unlike their British counterparts -- will fail to represent the people who elected them.Comments (730)Gavin de BeckerSecurity specialist; Founder, Gavin de Becker \u0026 AssociatesToday, we are warned by John Kerry and others that if we don\u0027t act with lethal force, the Syrian government will kill thousands more people. Let\u0027s not be deluded: When we do intervene militarily, the Syrian government (and we) will kill thousands more.Comments (492)Lori DuronMother of two, wife, blogger and author, \u0027Raising My Rainbow\u0027By trying to eliminate the need for a gay son to come out, I created an environment where a straight son felt the need to come out. As I try to learn from my mother\u0027s mistakes, I may be making some new ones of my own. I guess that\u0027s how it goes with parenting.Comments (640)John SkylarPhD candidate, science fiction author, and bloggerYou may just be unaware, you may have failed to learn about the city before you came to it, you may have forgotten to keep in mind that you\u0027re inconveniencing a horde of other people.Comments (1,452)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesMasha Gessen believes that it\u0027s time for Russian LGBT people to flee the country to escape what she says has now become \"all-out war\" against LGBT people in Russia.
