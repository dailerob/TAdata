{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week was a study in contrasting visions for the country. On Tuesday, President Obama gave his last State of the Union address, inviting us to end the \"rancor and suspicion\" that have enveloped us. That invitation was soundly rejected two nights later in the Republican presidential debate, which featured little but rancor and suspicion: sniping about birtherism (Canadian style), \"New York values,\" our military as \"a disaster\" and President Obama as \"a petulant child.\" At one point, discussing Donald Trump\u0027s idea to ban Muslim immigrants, an incredulous Jeb Bush, sounding like an uncool dad failing to get through to a room of adolescents, pleaded, \"we\u0027re running for the presidency of the United States here!\" Indeed. A good time to remember the words Pope Francis spoke to Congress, which President Obama repeated on Tuesday: \"To imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place.\"For one Bill Cosby, there are hundreds like him who will never be indicted. I think this way because I know it from experience. I have my own Bill Cosby tale to tell.Ernst Freund Distinguished Service Professor of Law and Ethics, The University of ChicagoWhat\u0027s been less noted is how the religious right, another force behind Cruz, would have responded if it knew at the time that Cruz was taking a loan from a company that had helped make marriage equality a reality.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostPresident Obama did one other thing this week. He said that one seat in the First Lady\u0027s State of the Union guest box will be left empty on Tuesday. It\u0027s a seat for the victims of gun violence who no longer have a voice -- for their families.Founder, Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in AmericaDr. King understood that there are two Americas: The America of golden opportunity, and the America that has little or no hope. He knew that a nation that does not have hope for most of its citizens can never be great. Like him, we must be passionate, courageous, and tireless activists.Diversity Visiting Professor, University of San Francisco; and Scholar Writer in Residence, MLK, Jr. Institute, Stanford UniversityFounder and CEO of the Imagine Institute, a think tankUnfortunately, Chelsea Clinton misrepresented Senator Sanders\u0027 position, and her premiere performance on the stump backfired, producing a flood of political donations to Sanders.Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanySenior writer, BillMoyers.com. Former senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.We need leaders willing to call out the corruption of our criminal justice system and clean it top-to-bottom. It\u0027s time to step up and become the leaders we\u0027ve been waiting for. It\u0027s time we stopped demanding justice from others and started creating it for ourselves. Who\u0027s with me?Founder of Garner Way Foundation and daughter of Eric GarnerWriter and Program Coordinator, Forward TogetherWhite Christians are as a whole less likely to believe the experiences of black Americans than non-Christian whites.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersIt is critically important that school districts and community partners across the country respond to Acting Secretary King\u0027s and Secretary Burwell\u0027s call to action to connect children to needed health coverage and ensure they\u0027re in school and ready to learn.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundThere are rules for issuing and securitizing mortgages. These rules were completely ignored in the peak years of the housing bubble. At every step, there were people who knew they were not following the law, but thought it would not matter.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027I came away with so many things from Bowie. Queer is beautiful: You\u0027re never too old to reinvent yourself. Reinvent yourself constantly, and you\u0027ll always be ahead of the curve. Be fearless. Be different. What you do today can inspire queer people 40 years from now.Director of Advocacy, SPARTAThe inescapable essence of birtherism is that Obama is not merely wrong on the issues, but an illegitimate president, a stranger who, by virtue of his origins, is uniquely undeserving of the decent respect otherwise due his office. Now let us contemplate the current treatment of that would-be president and child of Canada, Ted Cruz.Novelist and contributing opinion writerWe, like many of our constituents, have seen firsthand how this tragic epidemic has affected our own friends and loved ones, and by sharing their stories we hope to put a face to the addiction crisis.U.S. Representative, New Hampshire\u0027s second congressional districtDoes it really matter whether we classify the emerging technological configuration as a Third or Fourth Industrial Revolution? I believe it does. The evolution of digitalization has barely begun to run its course, and its new configuration in the form of the Internet of Things represents the next stage of its development.Author, \u0027The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of Things, the Collaborative Commons, and the Eclipse of Capitalism\u0027In our children\u0027s eyes especially, we\u0027re all kooks with quirks and flaws. At the root of this song is a celebration of this fact, a loving disclaimer from parent to child: we\u0027re not perfect, we\u0027re actually a little strange.Deputy Features Editor, The Huffington PostSitting to clear your mind is an excellent barometer of physical and mental health. It was sad to realize I could not even sit still for 10 minutes. I recommend meditation to anyone who needs a reminder that to be more effective at work, they need to slow down.Blogs Editor, Huffington PostI vehemently oppose Big Government and Nanny State regulation, but also have no use for guns, find hunting distasteful and wish that James Madison had never dreamed up the Second Amendment while politicking for the Constitution.Author, \u0027The Great Deformation: The Corruption of Capitalism in America\u0027To be clear: God is not finished with the Episcopal Church yet. We have miles to go and much work to do to overcome the many systemic issues that continue to challenge us as we strive to live into our call to be the Body of Christ in the world.Episcopal priest and activist from Pasadena, Calif.Why has Wall Street been pushing its lie, blaming the government for what happened? And why has the Street (along with its right-wing apologists, and its outlets such as Rupert Murdoch\u0027s Wall Street Journal) so viciously attacked the movie The Big Short?Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027Nothing would make me happier than Hollywood getting serious with this and hiring proper diversity experts and giving them full power to create a safe, inclusive, diverse industry... but that looks like a pipe dream.Writer and directorFree expression has not been stifled at Yale. We are functioning just the way a collegiate community should in attending to these challenges. Having surfaced important differences in experience and perspective, our campus community is searching in good faith for ways to recognize and address them.President of Yale UniversityBlack boys have an especially difficult time as they approach adulthood, and I sometimes feel helpless when I think about all of the tools you\u0027ll need to navigate the world. Remember that no matter where your life leads, I will always be your mother, your friend and your number one fan!CEO \u0026 FounderDavid Bowie did not die. Don\u0027t believe what you\u0027ve heard. Kill the messenger. Burn the newspapers and magazines. Yell out your window. David Bowie is alive. So alive, and he will live forever.Actor, Best Selling Author, and 2016 Grammy Nominated ComedianThese addresses often have an optimistic spin, and particularly so as a president nears the end of his term and seeks to cement his legacy, so let me say a few things that Mr. Obama surely knows but may be reluctant to put into words.President, The Greenlining InstituteAlthough I love my husband and even his last name, the fact of the matter is that it is not my name. Changing my name felt like giving up my identity.Blogger at It\u0027s Simply Lindsay (itssimplylindsay.com)On Saturday, six Republican candidates for president joined Speaker Paul Ryan, Senator Tim Scott, and other members of their party for a forum on poverty in America. Some of what they said made sense. Much of what they proposed did not.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributor34Justice co-founder and bloggerIt is neither the threat of the police nor being baked in a convection oven that evokes the most fear in Greek children; it is not the wooden spoon or sandal either. It\u0027s the death stare of a Greek mother -- or what I like to call, the Voldemort of punishments.Unofficial ambassador for young women striving to create their own identitiesIf we care at all about future generations, we must listen to the president\u0027s call for sensible gun legislation, while at the same time push for national police reform. We cannot address one while ignoring the other.President, National Action NetworkI\u0027m finally laying everything out on the table, because I know there are people in the world who need to hear this. I have nothing to apologize for, or to be ashamed of.Writer, feminist, bibliophile, and political junkie.Where are the David Bowies in our modern society? Where are the people in positions of power who look beyond themselves and say, \"I want to hear from those who don\u0027t look/act/think like me\"?Actor, writer, director and hand-talkerThe candidate with the least amount of media coverage, and the candidate thought of as unable to win a general election by some pundits (even though he beats Trump in a \"landslide of epic proportions\"), is the only candidate in 2016 with positive favorability numbers.Columnist published in The Cleveland Plain Dealer, The Baltimore Sun, The Hill, Salon, The Jerusalem Post www.hagoodman.comGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
