{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027Marissa Mayer tells us a lot about why Americans are so angry, and why anti-establishment fury has become the biggest single force in American politics today. Mayer is CEO of Yahoo. Yahoo’s stock lost about a third of its value last year, as the company went from making $7.5 billion in 2014 to losing $4.4 billion in 2015. Yet Mayer raked in $36 million in compensation. Even if Yahoo’s board fires her, her contract stipulates she gets $54.9 million in severance. In other words, Mayer can’t lose. It’s another example of no-lose socialism for the rich — winning big regardless of what you do. Why do Yahoo’s shareholders put up with it? Mostly because they don’t know about it.I don\u0027t believe Selena Gomez or Andra Day would intentionally harm a single child, and yet their association with Coke will inevitably set millions of children on a path to poor health.

It is critical for policy to address this problem, and the Young Child Tax Credit is an important step in the right direction.U.S. Representative, Connecticut\u0027s Third DistrictPresident, Center for American ProgressYes, I have a #womancard. Every woman does. This Mother\u0027s Day I decided I will take out my #womancard and play it by lifting up the peacemaking history of Mother\u0027s Day and by challenging the kind of violent, oppressive patriarchal power that leads to social conflict and ultimately to war.Professor of Theology, Chicago Theological SeminaryFifteen years after the 9/11 murders, we have uncovered a part of that truth, let us hope it does not take another fifteen years for the whole truth to emerge. Rest assured, we will never give up nor will we ever go away.9/11 widow and activistSanders hangs his claim on defining \"contested convention\" in a way it never has been before and ignoring the way voting takes place at the convention.University of Maine political scientist who focuses on the history and uses of public opinion in the United StatesI\u0027m a white mother of six children, five of whom are children of color, and four of whom came home to our family through foster-adoption.AuthorAre some corporations becoming allies of progressive reform -- or does it just look that way because most of the corporate elite and the Republican Party are now so far to the right?Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Every year some 150,000 to 300,000 businesses owned at least in part by Boomers have owners that hit retirement age.

This is true, but psychologists have also shown that the reverse is true: changing your body language changes your attitude.Author of #1 bestselling book, Emotional Intelligence 2.0, and president of TalentSmart, world\u0027s leading provider of emotional intelligence.Is Media Matters selectively exposing corporate reform while trying not to implicate or offend the current or potentially-future Democratic White House?Public school teacher, education activist, PhDThe man who still lives at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue has just unveiled his plan to move forward with \u0027smart gun\u0027 technology, and while the Devil is always in the details and I\u0027m not sure that all the details have been worked out, some of the hurdles that previously stymied the development of smart guns seem to have been anticipated and overcome.Mike the Gun GuyThe End Demand folks who are pushing this agenda are not concerned with the rights and safety of the women and men who sell sex; they are on some kind of high-minded moral crusade to \"rescue\" people who don\u0027t want or need to be rescued.Award-winning journalist, author and journalism professorIf you\u0027re reading this it means you\u0027re somewhere safe where there aren\u0027t airstrikes going on in the background or drone attacks?--?or maybe there are shots fired and there is still a secure wifi connection?--?either way I am thankful for the internet.Dentistry Student, Writer, Activist, Humanitarian, Sri Lankan \u0026 Canadian, Global HumanTurks who now speak out for secularism apparently don\u0027t see that it is exactly this Turkish form of \"secularism\" that put their country in this situation in the first place. Without Turkey\u0027s non-secular secularism, there would be no way to impose the conservative Islamic values of the AKP on school children. Turkey needs a constitution that finally gets rid off Turkey\u0027s non-secular secularism, which will continue to be used by anybody in power to suppress other groups in society.Turkey expert and Kurdistan correspondentUnlike Ted Cruz and the GOP elected officials obsessed with sexual orientation and identity issues, Trump recognizes that most Republicans are scared of something other than which public bathroom people use.Author of \u0027Obama’s America: A Transformative Vision of Our National Identity\u0027Trying to tackle \"trans issues,\" as though that were somehow a simple topic, with a token character in a one-off episode generally ends up being problematic at best and outright harmful at worst, and this episode was no exception.Trans Rights Advocate, Musician, Volunteer Coordinator for STRIVE, Social Media Coordinator for the Florida Transgender Alliance, Vlogger, Nerd, Artist, Proud Feminist SlutChief executive Tim Cook is probably one of the most competent operations executives in the industry but is clearly not a technology visionary.
