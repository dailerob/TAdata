{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027The problem with the young invincible story is that almost every part of it is wrong. It is true that under the rules set up for insurers in the exchanges young people will on average provide somewhat of a subsidy for older people. However the size of this subsidy is relatively minor. It also is primarily a young male story since young women tend to do things like have children that raise their health care costs. Furthermore, since the extent of the subsidy from the young to the old is relatively small, it really doesn\u0027t matter much how many young people sign up for the program. The Kaiser Family Foundation did an analysis showing that even an extreme skewing of enrollees toward older people would only raise costs in the program by 2 percent. A 2 percent increase in costs is not close to being enough to produce the sort of death spiral that is the dread of Obamacare supporters and dream of Obamacare opponents.Comments (86)Mika BrzezinskiCo-host, MSNBC’s \u0027Morning Joe\u0027When I put the phone down, I felt weird, incomplete, like I wasn\u0027t wearing a bra or something. At times during the beginning of the vacation, I actually held the phone even though it was off. It was like weaning: The turned-off phone was my binky.CommentsAdam GrantWharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027Admitting defeat, I was dragged onto Twitter kicking and screaming. I thought it was a necessary evil. And I was wrong. In the past year, I\u0027ve grown fond of Twitter. It might be partially due to cognitive dissonance. But it\u0027s also due to six benefits that no one mentioned.CommentsMax TegmarkPhysics professor, MITAt first glance, our universe doesn\u0027t seem very mathematical at all. The groundhog who trims our lawn has properties such as cuteness and fluffiness -- not mathematical properties. Yet we know that this groundhog -- and everything else in our universe -- is ultimately made of elementary particles such as quarks and electrons.Comments (16)Lina EscoDirector, \u0027Free the Nipple\u0027If an average teenager in America sees thousands of humans killed on TV shows by the time they\u0027re 18 I believe they can handle a nipple.Comments (43)Linda RobertsonLeader, Local HIV/AIDS Outreach Team, Overlake Christian Church; Volunteer, RoseHedge MultiFaith WorksWe told our son that he had to choose between Jesus and his sexuality. Choosing God, practically, meant living a lifetime condemned to being alone. So, just before his 18th birthday, Ryan, depressed, suicidal and disillusioned, made a new choice.Comments (2,878)David Crosby and Ben Cohen \"Who are the men, who really run this land? Why do they run it with such a thoughtless hand?\" Crosby, Stills, \u0026 Nash have been singing this song for many, many years now, and we\u0027ve had enough. With the deluge of dark money flooding our elections, we feel that these questions have never been more important to ask.CommentsArianna HuffingtonI\u0027ve just returned from the most amazing place. I\u0027m not talking about Hawaii, where I spent the holidays with my daughters, my sister and my ex-husband -- though it was lovely, and all the more so because of the foot of snow that\u0027s greeted my return to New York. I\u0027m talking about the week I spent unplugged, away from email, social media and TV.Comments (14)Janet TavakoliPresident, Tavakoli Structured FinanceThe growth of the U.S.\u0027s bigger and broader productive economy has been stunted by bad policies and bank bailouts benefiting rent-seeking financiers siphoning off an outsized percentage of the nation\u0027s gross domestic product (GDP).CommentsEric CooperFounder, President of the National Urban Alliance for Effective EducationFor the benefit of the nation, we must limit the use of testing and employ it strategically as a tool that can help students view learning with curiosity and frame their responsibilities as citizens of a great country.CommentsNadia TolokonnikovaActivist, Pussy Riot band member\"They beat you once, then may come grab your hair, hit your head on the sewing machine or take you into a punishment cell, there they kick you using hands, legs, or remove the belt from a sewing machine and thrash you with it.\"Comments (27)Anne SinclairEditorial Director, Le Huffington PostThere is so much ineptness in a recent Newsweek article by Janine di Giovanni aimed at destroying France -- now a specialty of the magazine. \"French bashing\" is trendy again among Anglo-Saxons!CommentsBryan AppleyardSpecial feature writer, The Sunday TimesDon\u0027t take any notice of people who tell you that Philomena is a polemic against the Catholic church or an anti-religous diatribe.

Only in the case of the five alleged perpetrators of the September 11 attacks did the plan cause such an uproar that their case was moved to another country.CommentsEdward WassermanDean, UC Berkeley Graduate School of JournalismWhy do the media have so little place in their editorial imaginations for the pain of these wars when the people hurting aren\u0027t ours? Why do they dwell on a bruised fist while ignoring the face it shattered?CommentsRichard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureIt\u0027s true that Enron\u0027s energy market manipulations were horrible. Enron executives and employees deprived people of their life savings, drove up the price of a vital public utility, and concealed their crimes with all the wiliness of history\u0027s worst master conspirators. But JPMorgan Chase did everything Enron did -- and much, much more.CommentsMatt WalshBlogger, talk radio host, father of twinsNow, to speak directly to a certain terrifying subset of this species.

Thus we expect regular reports both from the universities and from them. Otherwise, both can expect to hear from us.CommentsGeoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoWe do not hesitate to make phone calls because of the infinitesimal risk that the government might be using a pen register to track our calls.

That is a good thing for college football. Let me rephrase that: It is a great thing for college football. And the SEC showing a chink in its armor might just be as well.CommentsRev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action Networkhen issues like women\u0027s reproductive rights, unemployment benefits, marriage equality, economic fairness, education, immigration reform, a minimum wage increase and affordable health care are on the line, how can anyone think that making promises or a new year\u0027s resolution is enough?CommentsEzra PriorWriterReading Letters, a collection of Kurt Vonnegut\u0027s letters, edited by Dan Wakefield, allowed me to connect with my grandfather by pretending that I was their recipient.

But, through it all, I remained a loyal supporter, because I respected his independence and I knew his heart was in the right place.CommentsBill MoyersManaging Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyFirst it was Wisconsin. Now it\u0027s North Carolina that is redefining the term \"battleground state.\" On one side: a right wing government enacting laws that are changing the face of the state.
