{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogThere is no clash between Islam and the West, except in the minds of the Islamic State and the ideologues of the “free world” who believe that inside every Muslim is an Islamofascist dying to get out. The real clash is taking place within a civilization, within Islam, over doctrinal issues, the nature of the state, the relationship with the market, and so on — and the Islamic State is largely peripheral to this ideological clash. More fundamentally, an equally contentious struggle is going on within the so-called free world. Here is where the civilizational rubber really hits the road. Will enough good people of conscience -- enough moderate Christians and moderate Jews and moderate whatevers in the United States -- stand up to the intolerance of our native extremism?One thing on which both Democrats and Republicans agree: in this time of good tidings when you care enough to give the very best, a little something tucked away in legislation in exchange for campaign largesse is, as my Texas mother used to say, better than black-eyed peas on New Year\u0027s.Senior writer, BillMoyers.com. Former senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.For me, football was a lifeline. And for many other NFL players, it was a lifeline. If it wasn\u0027t for football, a lot of us would be dead, or lost, roaming the streets somewhere. With all due respect, Dr. Omalu, football doesn\u0027t give us an opportunity to play a game. It gives us a chance at life.NFL wide receiver; Co-founder, PROJECT 375It\u0027s particularly difficult when sex is used as a weapon to hurt someone you love--especially if it\u0027s a child.

This is what I wish I wasn\u0027t an expert in.Freelance writer, teacher, and speaker making light of the dark stuffDuncan leaves as he came -- making word-noises that actually sound pretty good, but are attached to policies and a reality that does not reflect them at all. Duncan never held himself responsible for the progress of students, choosing instead to blame bad, lazy teachers and low-information parents (so long, white suburban moms) and a Congress that wouldn\u0027t behave as he wanted it to.Teacher and writer; blogger, curmudgucation.blogspot.comWe need to fight against the fear and anger directed at Muslims and others. We need to resist the dangerous prejudices of our past that gave us the Jim Crow laws, the Chinese Exclusion Act, Japanese incarceration during World War II, and jobs offered with the caveat that Irish, Italians, or Jews need not apply.U.S. Representative for California\u0027s 27th DistrictWell if you didn\u0027t like the way the CEO class used their huge political donations and fleet of lobbyists to manipulate the economic rules last time, wait until you see what they\u0027ve cooked up now.Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersOn the title track of her classic album No Secrets, Carly Simon sings, “Sometimes I wish that I never knew some of those secrets of yours.” With the release of her autobiography, Boys In The Trees: A Memoir, Simon surrenders so many secrets that one might find him or herself reiterating that same sentiment.Trafficbeat Entertainment, Music Biz VetAt the heart of the American mental health crisis today lies the highly flawed, dangerous and unspoken assumption that people with mental disabilities are somehow less than human.Author, Attorney, Activist, UN Global ExpertAmong those who founded our nation were those fleeing religious persecution.

Or can we cross this bridge to a new America where we begin to see the \"beloved community\" that Dr. King envisioned?Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersWhen a candidate\u0027s speech veers into such unconstitutional, un-American territory as proposing a religious litmus test for entering our country, the core values of America are in jeopardy.President, Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute(HUC-JIR), North America\u0027s first Jewish seminary, in Cincinnati, Jerusalem, LA and NY.As much as I hate to admit it, however, I can\u0027t shake the notion that there may be value in Trump\u0027s words: they were proof that we all actually can agree on something.President, Spokane Interfaith CouncilIn a provocative interview with Truthdig Editor Robert Scheer for his KCRW podcast \"Scheer Intelligence,\" John Kiriakou, author of The Reluctant Spy: My Secret Life in the CIA\u0027s War on Terror, details his 15 years as a CIA analyst and counterterrorism operation officer specializing in the Mideast.Editor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027They Know Everything About You\u0027That loud sighing sound you heard after the San Bernardino shooting was a collective sigh of relief from guns of all sorts from all over the United States. And for good reason. Each time the mass slaughter of U.S. citizens occurs, the guns worry that someone will remember Australia and Scotland and suggest that the United States should do what those countries did after mass shootings.LawyerIt is the fact that we have indeed \"been down similar roads before\" that should most shake us from any temptation to believe that we are inherently \"better than this.\" Historically, we have been both better than this and worse than this.Executive Director, Center for Constitutional RightsIt is our collective responsibility - as parents, educators, community members, and as a society - to ensure that all young people have equal access to a high quality, world-class education.

Ducommun Professor of Education Emeritus at Stanford UniversityThe new national mood is, \"we have everything to fear, including fear itself.\" In part, it\u0027s an unintended consequence of a political strategy sparked by the far right in 2010 -- or perhaps, after all, it was intentional.Congressman from New York\u0027s 3rd Congressional District; Author of the book \u0027The Global War On Morris\u0027Some commentators have argued President Barack Obama suffers from a failure of leadership. That was evidenced once again last week when he traveled to Paris to demand the world cut greenhouse gas emissions on the very day his administration was making moves that would do just the opposite.AuthorBernie Sanders won\u0027t need an acceptable number of debates to defeat Clinton. Bernie Sanders will become our next president because he\u0027s winning among normal, everyday Americans; not a select group of less than 1,000 people meant to speak for 316 million other Americans.Columnist published in The Cleveland Plain Dealer, The Baltimore Sun, The Hill, Salon, The Jerusalem Post www.hagoodman.comIt is so easy to talk about abstinence. Lots of people could get behind it. Teachers really didn\u0027t need to know anything about reproductive health. They just had to know how to teach kids to say \"no\" to sex. One of the easiest ways to do this was through shame.Reproductive biologist specializing in male fertility and an educator focusing on reproductive health for all ages.What\u0027s happened with the Somali refugees is likely what would happen with the Syrians and other refugees, especially those relocated to smaller, former industrial cities with population drain -- places in need of revitalization.Cross-genre writer based in Boston and MaineThe Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT), a US climate change denial group that espouses the \"free-market,\" has lost more than two thirds of its funding in the past two years, according to tax filings reviewed by the Center for Media and Democracy (CMD).Director of Research at The Center for Media \u0026 DemocracyIt\u0027s not easy avoiding her -- she\u0027s everywhere.

A teacher? A protector? A guide? A master? An editor? A coach? A fresh eye? All these things. The 2015 class of Rolex artistic protégés will remember what their distinguished mentors have taught them: To trust themselves. To be fearless. To get joy from difficulty. To bring narrative to a project. To rehearse in a hallway for three days and not be afraid. To juggle. To avoid being academic or theoretical. To become more \"wild\". To work hard. To question their identity. To use all five senses. To learn that to be an artist is a solitary journey, most often a frightening one.Culture Columnist, Huffington Post, CultureZohnWhen I speak at colleges about my own story of sexual abuse, I never forget how difficult it was for me to even speak the words, \"I was sexually abused.\" It took me an even longer time to believe it, or to understand it could happen to me.PTSD peer-peer specialist, artist, author, survivor, award-winning founder of the Fearless Ostomates, actress and playwright touring the country with Gutless \u0026 Grateful, her one-woman musical autobiography.
