{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027My pragmatist friends make a number of arguments in their effort to dismiss the Sanders phenomenon.First, Sanders is too left-wing to get nominated, much less elected. In principle he is, but this isn\u0027t a normal year. There is mass economic frustration in the land; it is finally, belatedly, the main issue in a presidential campaign; and, it is up for grabs politically and ideologically. We can blame foreigners and government, or we can blame a badly tilted economic system. If a Republican populist is nominated, a Democratic populist might well do better than a Democratic moderate in energizing the electorate and winning over working class voters who might otherwise support a figure like Donald Trump. The polls show Sanders doing better than Clinton against the main Republican contenders. My pragmatist friends dismiss these on the grounds that the voters haven\u0027t really focused on Sanders\u0027 views yet, and the Republicans haven\u0027t yet opened up the heavy artillery.Clinton still has a gap to traverse to lock in votes this primary season. She\u0027s already made significant changes to her campaign to change course and not repeat 2008. But schooling young women on what it means to be a feminist isn\u0027t going to win any votes.Host/Producer, HuffPost LiveI never got drunk . I was just \u0027taking the edge off\u0027. But I also recognized that reaching for a glass of wine, or three, had become my response to stress or sorrow in my life. And like most women I know -- most human beings -- there was generally plenty of that.Author and journalistThere are many seniors, like me, who are seasoned in the history of the struggle with a strong and deep connection to the pursuit of social justice for the Black communityAdministrative Coordinator for LGBT Faith Leaders of African DescentIn their interest to garner favor with U.S. companies (mainly in search of campaign funds), the U.S. Congress has allowed these companies to escape U.S. corporate taxes by magically declaring that their IP is located in some foreign tax haven.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia UniversityFebruary 8 marks the one-year anniversary of McKenna\u0027s death. Now is the time for journalists who were missing a year ago to shed light on the circumstances surrounding McKenna\u0027s death. This date is an opening for activists across the country to take to the streets and march for justice for Natasha McKenna just as they have for Black men.Writer, activist and intersectional feministOur democracy is strongest when everyone is able to participate, and it is time to fulfill that promise to the American people. The people should be selecting their leaders, not the other way around.U.S. Representative, Wisconsin\u0027s 2nd congressional districtCo-chair, Congressional Progressive Caucus; U.S. Representative for Minnesota\u0027s 5th DistrictIf you think that we need a leader who will push to change the way we see the world then it makes perfect sense to imagine Bernie as the realistic candidate, the one who will get things done.Author of a dozen books, including \u0027The End of Nature\u0027 and \u0027Deep Economy\u0027If you haven\u0027t talked to your child\u0027s teacher about what their lesson plans are for Black History Month (or for any subject), I encourage you to do so.The burden of education isn\u0027t solely on the teachers. It\u0027s my responsibility, as well. There are many opportunities available for what your children learn. You just have to ask.Writer and bloggerPerhaps no moment epitomizes Clinton\u0027s courage, activism, brilliance and defiance of convention than her challenge posed to the Chinese government when she spoke before the United Nation\u0027s 4th World Conference on Women in Beijing on 5 September 1995.Cultural critic, essayist and novelist published with Parkett, Art in America and Bijutsu TechoNAFTA and the TPP are giant greenbacks for multinational corporations. CEOs close U.S. factories, destroy the lives of American workers and collect bigger profits as a result of the less-than-subsistence wages they pay foreign labor.International President, United SteelworkersTrying to poach jobs across state lines is an expensive waste of taxpayer resources. Investing in making your state a great place to run a business, on the other hand...now that\u0027s a smart idea.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributor34Justice co-founder and bloggerMedia message received: Clinton is loud and cantankerous! But it\u0027s not just awkward gender stereotypes that are in play these days. It\u0027s a much larger pattern of thumb-on-the-scale coverage and commentary. Just look at what seemed to be the press\u0027 insatiable appetite to frame Clinton\u0027s Iowa caucus win last week as an unnerving loss.Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaWhile the press likes to portray Santorum as a kooky culture warrior and Rubio as an establishment square, the two hold many of the exact same positions. The similarities start with their dangerous views on abortion rights.President, People For the American WayCheap gasoline raises the perennial question over how the U.S. funds its transportation infrastructure -- a key rationale behind Obama\u0027s proposed oil tax. And it makes electric vehicles (EVs) and biofuels less competitive on price, hindering U.S. efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and oil consumption. Can the U.S. continue to fund upkeep of its infrastructure and reduce emissions from transportation?Independent source of news and analysis, from the academic and research community.Maybe if we stopped claiming that we were the greatest, most exceptional, most indispensable nation ever and that the U.S. military was the finest fighting force in the history of the world, both we and the world might be better off and modestly more peaceful.Editor, TomDispatch.comDrunk drivers, earthquakes, cancer, shooters -- and now cranes. It\u0027s rattling to be reminded how vulnerable we are. We busy our lives to distract ourselves from mortality, to extract meaning from absurdity, to pretend we control a cosmos of chance. At best, what I get from Worth Street is the gong of mindfulness. Savor the moment. Hug your children. Don\u0027t go back to sleep. At worst: Grow up. It\u0027s all hanging by a thread.USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorOf course candidates have to deny that they listen to Wall Street, and flatter voters into thinking ordinary people\u0027s opinions about high finance and economic fairness really matter. But of course most candidates also suppose that ordinary people don\u0027t understand banking and that bankers do.Professor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027It\u0027s time for us to stop singing along to any song that has the n-word or celebrates blackness in a way we will never understand. Our ancestors signed away that right when they signed their names to contracts that said they owned human beings.Founder, #IRLProjectCall out sexism and misogyny -- especially if it\u0027s coming from someone who claims to be progressive. However, I worry the label is being thrown around loosely and being applied to many well-meaning, non-sexist male critics of Clinton.Professor, writer, blogger, feminist, activist, and social justice warriorProgressive change has never happened without bold ideas championed by bold idealists.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027The citizens of Flint deserve much more than a steady convoy of trucks carrying privately donated bottled water. They deserve a full-fledged humanitarian military deployment, and a steady convoy of trucks carrying the equipment needed to repair their broken infrastructure and homes.Thinker, writer and speaker.Because he\u0027s backed by the GOP establishment -- and apparently, because his backers view him, rightly or wrongly, as the only candidate who can court the extremes and still woo the middle -- many in the media proclaim him to be a moderate. But still, how is that possible?Queer Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostLike many simplistic and \"sound bite\" arguments of the modern era, and of Sanders in particular, the argument that Hillary Clinton supported the war George W. Bush prosecuted in Iraq is nonsense.Former Obama Administration official, political activist, attorneyThis debate was not so much about winners and also-rans as it was about the one clear loser: Marco Rubio. If Rubio had not shown so much promise earlier in the campaign, the loss would seem less momentous.Professor of Journalism, Northeastern University, BostonI reject the notion that FIFA cannot be reformed from within. The crisis at FIFA is a crisis of leadership.FIFA presidential candidateThis is the same person you have loved and love still, so be there for her by listening closely rather than just hearing what she has to say. Remember that her actions speak louder than her words... and this is never more true than when faced with a health crisis.Human Behavior, Parenting, and Education Expert, Speaker, Author. Ph.D., Ed.D., M.Ed.Hillary is veering from the truth when she suggests her $225,000 per speech fee, paid three times by Goldman Sachs, was \"what they offered.\" It was not what they offered -- it was what Team Hillary demanded.Author, \"Runaway Inequality: An Activist\u0027s Guide to Economic Justice\"An expert might be reasonably good at predicting the growth of a single exponential technology (e.g. the Internet of Things), but try to predict the future when eight technologies are all doubling, morphing and recombining.Chairman/CEO, XPRIZEIn this episode of \"Scheer Intelligence\", Robert Scheer sits down with potential Green party presidential candidate, Jill Stein, to discuss her plans and why she thinks the Green Party is more relevant than ever.Editor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027They Know Everything About You\u0027Shrum and Lowry hear two \"sighs of relief\" in Iowa -- from HRC, because two straight losses would\u0027ve been awful, and from Lowry, because Iowa vindicated his gutsy National Review issue denouncing Trump. Also: There\u0027s now a sense that Clinton\u0027s rising in NH, while Rubio\u0027s robotry reveals someone more callow than charismatic.Host, \u0027Both Sides Now\u0027Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
