{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThere\u0027s an interesting debate going on right now as to factors behind the rise in the inequality of earnings that\u0027s been a fixture of our job market for decades (with interesting and germane variations, as you\u0027ll see). At the center of the debate is whether technological change is the main factor driving inequality or is it policy changes that end up steering more income growth towards those at the top of the wage scale. You can definitely show that deunionization, lower minimum wages, and persistently high unemployment rates contributed to the growth of inequality in ways that are more empirically consistent than skill-biased technological change. But they only get you part of the way there in terms of explaining the trends.Read Post | Comments (449)Bob Cesca, 01/18/13Political Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowThis week, President Obama announced a bold series of new gun control regulations. The roster of actions went far beyond the expectations of gun control advocates, while blunting some of the paranoid delusions of the gun lobby and the Republican Party.Read Post | Comments (556)Alexander Tsiaras, 01/18/13Founder, CEO and Editor-in-Chief, TheVisualMD.comMy goal is to visualize life in all its glory.

Squires, 01/18/13Professor of sociology, public policy and public administration, George Washington UniversityObama owes quite a bit to the black community, but not because of the vote, his color or even the presumably more liberal politics of his Democratic Party but because the federal government, among others, has an obligation to address the continuing significance of race in America.Read Post | Comments (50)Susie Pearl, 01/18/13Happiness, Well-Being ActivistAs we enter into the swing of a bright new year full of potential, many of us are busy setting up new plans and ideas for the coming months.Read Post | Comments (31)Jim Wallis, 01/18/13Christian leader for social changeWayne LaPierre\u0027s statement \"the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun\" is at the heart of the problem of gun violence in America today -- not just because it is factually flawed, but also because it is morally mistaken, theologically dangerous, and religiously repugnant.Read Post | Comments (92)Sierra Black, 01/18/13Writer, activist, motherSometimes, open relationships just suck.

In direct contrast to his opponent, he pledged to lift all boats -- especially those boats that had gotten stuck in the mud. Now that he is about to begin his second term, the black community is watching to see how he will follow through.Read Post | Comments (45)Bill Moyers, 01/18/13Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyThe United States Senate -- known as \"the world\u0027s greatest deliberative body\" when I had a summer job there almost 60 years ago -- is now a carbuncle on the body politic.Read Post | Comments (17)Kevin Powell, 01/18/13Public speaker and activist; author, \u0027Barack Obama, Ronald Reagan, and the Ghost of Dr. King: Blogs and Essays\u0027Imagine, for a moment, if Lance Armstrong, cancer survivor, had merely raced in the Tour de France and finished, even it was last?

Boyd Jr., 01/17/13Fourth-generation farmerWhat are you hunting that requires the need of a semi-automatic weapon -- an instrument used for military warfare?

Moore, 01/18/13Writer, educator, and activistLike powerful divinities, grays remind us of our impermanence. They are cues that we are getting \"old,\" which is a descriptor used by the young to signal that which is no longer en vogue.

Stone, 01/18/13Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoThe denial of the \"title\" of marriage serves only one purpose -- to denigrate and diminish the dignity of the same-sex or interracial or interfaith or Catholic or African-American unions.
