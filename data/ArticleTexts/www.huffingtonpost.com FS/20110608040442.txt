{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Reacting to the latest round of depressing jobs numbers, the president said that it is just like \"if you got hit by a truck, it\u0027s going to take a while for you to mend.\" Being hit by a truck is not a bad metaphor -- but he left something out.

Charles Rangel, 06.07.2011Representative from the 15th Congressional District in New YorkOur deficit will not be reduced by ending Medicare and Medicaid.
