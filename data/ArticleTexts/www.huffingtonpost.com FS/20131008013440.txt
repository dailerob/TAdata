{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Josh SilverDirector, Represent.UsWhile Congress acts like 535 corrupt adolescents in a food fight, our government shuts down, and America\u0027s struggling middle class is driven further down the economic ladder, our Supreme Court is contemplating whether to allow the barons of the New Gilded Age to bribe those adolescents with even bigger bribes that will ensure their prosperity at the expense of the rest of us. How many more articles like this can you stomach? It\u0027s time for the American people to get off the mouse wheel of loathing and despair, and become part of the solution to this, the imperative political challenge of our times.Comments (107)Michael SmerconishSiriusXM Radio HostYou know who should be angry about Obamacare? Real socialists. The tea party opponents of the Affordable Care Act promised them a government incursion that the new law does not deliver.Comments (826)Mike FanningExecutive Vice President, U.S. Insurance Group, Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance CompanyThis generation has come of age in one of the bleakest economies in decades.

The same people who object to my tone waste no time denouncing me in abusive language.Comments (262)Gov. Deval PatrickGovernor, MassachusettsAccessible, affordable, quality care in all cases improves lives and in many cases saves lives. It gives peace of mind and economic security to families. It increases productivity for large and small employers as well as for students. It creates jobs and contributes to our economic strength. It\u0027s a powerful statement of who we are.Comments (333)Carole KingSinger, songwriter and environmental activistI don\u0027t understand how men and women who want the best for their children and grandchildren can be so blind to the consequences of their actions. There is nowhere to hide from global warming.Comments (56)Leo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersThe threat made by the Grumpy Obstructionist Party (GOP) is simple: \"Gimme what I want or I\u0027ll kill the government.\" Democrats refused to pay the ransom by defunding the Affordable Care Act, so the GOP defunded the federal government.Comments (224)Patricia Leavy, PhDAuthor of American Circumstance and Fiction as Research PracticeStrong bonds between women are vitally important as we negotiate both the everyday stuff of life and the bigger challenges and choices we face. While I feel fortunate to have a range of meaningful female friendships, I\u0027ve had my share of dysfunctional relationships too,CommentsDr. Carmen HarraAuthor, clinical psychologist and relationship expertI\u0027ve committed my grandmother\u0027s invaluable wisdoms to memory and recall them whenever faced with uneasy decisions. It\u0027s amazing how a few simple words which we believe with conviction can enrich us with an incredible power to act and an unimaginable strength to recover.Comments (21)Steven L. SpiegelProfessor of Political Science, UCLAWhether the Obama-Rohani phone call will turn out to be the equivalent of the Nixon era\u0027s breakthrough with China remains to be seen. But, as in the case of China, such a dramatic turn of events requires assuring neighbors that their vital security interests will be protected.Comments (11)Neta C. Crawford and Catherine LutzYes, Bin Laden was killed. But so were approximately 145,000 other people in Afghanistan and Pakistan, including 2,280 U.S. soldiers. And this is the tip of the iceberg -- many more have died or been injured because of the destruction of infrastructure and the mass dislocation that always accompany war.CommentsLisa BelkinSenior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, The Huffington PostLisa Miller’s written-to-be-controversial article in New York Magazine this week paints parents as ethically challenged at best and downright venal at worst.Comments (18)Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027It\u0027s beginning to look as if the Republican effort to hold the rest of the government hostage for the sacking of the Affordable Care Act just might backfire, big time.Comments (1,134)ThrillistWe\u0027re a quick, free, daily e-mail ...The following 10 behaviors are surefire ways to seriously piss off these hard-working bean-grinders.Comments (27)Jason SaltmarshCompetitive masters runnerI took notice the other day when I heard someone say that \"running families are always the nicest people.\" Of course, I always thought that was true, but it was gratifying to hear my secret theory being confirmed aloud in public by a complete stranger.Comments (17)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkBlacks, Latinos, Native Americans, Asians, women, gays and other marginalized groups have fought long and hard to level the playing field and bring about change. While we have many more challenges ahead of us, we have made tremendous gains.Comments (19)V-DayA global activist movement to end violence against women and girlsLast year ONE BILLION RISING was a \"catalyst and a wind.\" This year, come dance again. Come sing. Come imagine. And, come to reconfigure and begin to restructure the world with stronger winds. We are doing it for ourselves, and everyone.CommentsDesmond Tutu1984 Nobel Peace Prize winnerWe need each other\u0027s magnificence to be fully human. I need, and the world needs, you to be the unique and wonderful gift that you are. You are made for goodness and to be a person of peace. This is true for you and for every single human being on the planet. So join us on the Ubuntu Train and be part of the movement for peace within, among and between people.CommentsMichelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesThe fact that any American in 2013 -- let alone a justice of the United States Supreme Court, located in a major urban center with a large LGBT population -- can say he or she doesn\u0027t know anyone who is openly gay is pretty astounding. Scalia has spun a cocoon around himself.Comments (70)Amitai EtzioniProfessor of international relations, George Washington UniversityOn Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court will decide whether the core, remaining limits on campaign contributions -- the individual caps -- should be struck down in McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorOne of the problems we\u0027re facing now is the inability of the House Republican leadership to mete out effective discipline on the Tea Party, or, if you will, the \"shutdown caucus.\" And one reason for that -- not the only reason, maybe not even the biggest -- is gerrymandering.Comments (20)Fodor\u0027sFodors.comNot everyone wants the typical room service, continental breakfast, and double bed of a chain hotel. Whether you still harbor a childhood dream of living in a treehouse, or you love wine so much you\u0027d give anything to sleep inside a giant empty wine barrel, there\u0027s a crazy hotel out there that fits your vacation needs.Comments (21)Molly BlakeWriter, military spouseHe sharpened his SpongeBob pencil and carefully penned the following letter: \"Dear Admiral McRaven, When I grow up, I want to be a SEAL too but can you tell me who is quieter -- SEALs or Ninjas? Also how long can you hold your breath for? v/r Walker Greentree.\"Comments (15)Brandt GoldsteinAuthor and Visiting Professor, New York Law SchoolWill we finally see the umpire that the Chief Justice promised us? Or will he continue to move the foul lines and alter the strike zone to favor the rich and the powerful? Americans should keep their eyes on the Court.Comments (14)Dean KarnazesUltramarathonerNature? Nurture? Who\u0027s to say? Perhaps, we really were born to run and some people feel this intrinsic primordial instinct stronger than others?CommentsAllison TateWriter, mother of fourI still have to push down feelings of insecurity when giving myself over to the mercies of the camera. But I\u0027m working on it.CommentsThe Daily MealTheDailyMeal.comCountries all over the world have their own lists of edible items that are banned from being imported or consumed. While some of the foods banned in the U.S. may seem obvious -- like the deadly Japanese blowfish -- others might be quite surprising.Comments (118)Rebecca SolnitAuthor, \u0027A Paradise Built in Hell\u0027Sometimes I wish media stories were organized in proportion to their impact. Unfortunately, when it comes to climate change, there is not paper enough on this planet to properly scale up a story to the right size.CommentsYuen ChanLecturer of Journalism at the Chinese University of Hong KongThe term \"monster parent\" was first coined in Japan to describe excessively protective parents who meddle in every aspect of their children\u0027s lives, and constantly complain to and about their teachers.CommentsYouyoung Lee and Aaron TimmsWas that uncomfortable for anyone else? Also, how much longer before Brody surfaces to (hopefully) get the show gets back on track?Comments (18)Wendell PotterAuthor, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgHad there been no shutdown, the D.C. press corps would have covered every glitch accompanying last Tuesday\u0027s launch of the Obamacare-created health insurance marketplaces to the point that the glitches would be all that they -- and we -- would be talking about now.Comments (35)Miri Ben-AriGrammy Award-winning violinist/producerIf you had the choice, would you give your child a video game or a musical instrument to play daily?CommentsDale Hansen, 2013. 7.10Lawrence D.
