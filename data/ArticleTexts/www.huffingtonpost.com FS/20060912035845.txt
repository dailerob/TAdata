{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"From news.yahoo.comAPFrom silverthorn.comFrom bbc.co.ukOn Sunday, Dick Cheney offered a picture of what completing the mission in Iraq would look like that was as untethered from reality as the notion of purple unicorns taking sips from the Euphrates. Unfortunately, many Democrats continue to buy into the GOP\u0027s \"complete the mission\" framing. Hillary Clinton certainly did during the Senate debate on Don Rumsfeld. \"We went to war with the secretary of defense we had,\" she said. \"Now is the time to complete the mission with a new secretary of defense that we need.\" As a soundbyte it was a winner -- a pithy callback of a Rummy classic. But as a message it was a total loser. Please tell us, Sen. Clinton: what \"mission\" are you talking about, and how will we know we\u0027ve completed it?READ POST09.11.2006 Taylor MarshFive years after 9/11 it\u0027s once again time to ask why Osama bin Laden is still alive.READ POST | comments09.11.2006 Tim DickinsonThe administration, in the height of cynicism, preferred to keep Zarqawi alive because his presence in Iraq bolstered the case for toppling Saddam.READ POST | comments09.11.2006 Michael Oates PalmerWhat moves me beyond no end is that the memories from five years ago are more vivid than my memories from a day last week.READ POST | comments09.11.2006 John SeeryBy lending her academic authority to the Bush administration\u0027s fiasco in Iraq, providing cover and credibility, Condoleezza Rice has sold her soul to the Devil of Mendacity.READ POST | comments (18)09.11.2006 Linda Cronin-GrossFive years later, Imagine New York still stands as a testament to what\u0027s possible within a real democracy and within the context of pain and national tragedy.READ POST | comments09.11.2006 Paul HippREAD POST | comments (55)09.11.2006 David SirotaNo matter how many GOP politicians and operatives in Washington spit on the graves of 9/11 victims, they just can\u0027t hide the facts anymore.READ POST | comments09.11.2006 Rachel SklarIt\u0027s all there - the fluttering papers; the sudden fireball as the second plane slices into Tower Two; the horrified upturned faces; the crumbling towers slipping down into clouds of dust.READ POST | comments09.11.2006 Scott ThillHere we are, five years later, wondering how to situate, contextualize, memorialize and, most importantly, capitalize on 9/11.READ POST | comments09.11.2006 Sean HuzeThe most important thing this film accomplishes is that it forces Americans to pay more attention to what\u0027s being asked of young men and women in uniform.READ POST09.11.2006 Patt MorrisonWhat may wind up being the most pointless trial in the entire War on Terror is all because a guy from Skokie didn\u0027t want his mom to know he was horny.READ POST | commentsSimon JenkinsEric AltermanGeorge LakoffRJ EskowJesse KornbluthJohn FundRobert ScheerBob CescaBob GeigerAPAPFrom ncdc.noaa.govAPFrom nytimes.comFrom adweek.comLogin to Huffington Post  |  Make Huff Post your Home Page  |  RSS/XML  |  Sitemap  |  JobsCopyright 2006 © HuffingtonPost.com, LLC   |  User Agreement  |  Privacy  |  Comment Policy  |  Powered by MovableType","h1":"",".title":"","h2":"Bush: “The Safety Of America Depends On The Outcome Of The Battle In The Streets Of Baghdad”...Memo to Democrats: Stop Buying into the GOP Framing on IraqDARK MILESTONE: More Americans Have Now Died In Iraq Than Died On 9/11Memo to Democrats: Stop Buying into the GOP Framing on Iraq\"Path of 9/11\": Finally, Painfully, The Stuff We All Know Is TrueHindsight at 20/25: A Call to the Post-9/11 Millennial GenerationThe Mundane DetailsHow Did We Get From 9/11 to Iraq?9/11 -- The Movie -- and The Terrorist Bush Let Slip AwayThe Mundane DetailsHarvard, Say It Ain\u0027t So!After 9/11, An Exercise in Democracy as Thousands Helped \"Imagine New York;\" Lesson Learned?Two Thousand Six Hundred SoulsSince 9/11, We\u0027ve Come So Far Yet Progressed So Little\"Path of 9/11\": Finally, Painfully, The Stuff We All Know Is TrueMemorializing HyperrealityThe Ground Truth: Waking Folks the Hell UpNo Sex Please, We\u0027re Homeland SecurityGiving Terrorism what it Craves9/11: America Attacked Twice (And P.S., I\u0027m Fired)Five Years After 9/11: Drop the War Metaphor9/11: Rain of Blood, Reign of FearSometimes, Pictures say it all: Joel Meyerowitz on \"The Pile\"Clinton Officials Have a Point on Docudramas - Let\u0027s Clean Them All UpGaping Holes in the 9/11 NarrativeFive Years Without Another AttackRepublican Senator: Iraq Insurgents \"Same Enemy\" Who Attacked on 9/11","h3":"-RJ Eskow-Arianna Huffington-Rachel Sklar-Jake Brewer-Michael Oates PalmerBlogsColumnistsFull BlogrollArianna Online ArchiveNews Sources",".snippet":"","h4":"British Leader Blasts Blair\u0027s “Slavish” Support For Bush...Half Of British Think “War On Terror” In Being Lost...Congress Demands Hewlett-Packard Records...George Allen\u0027s Opponent Has “Nearly Erased Lead” In Wake Of “Macaca” Comment...Climate Change Feeds Destructive Hurricanes, New Study Shows...Sen.
