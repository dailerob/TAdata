{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editorial Director, AOL Huffington Post Media GroupThis presidential campaign is shaping up as one of the most personally nasty in modern times -- and more quickly than experts thought it would. Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama already are in choreographed hand-to-hand combat mode. The GOP\u0027s presumptive nominee has angrily demanded an apology from Obama himself for a campaign staffer\u0027s suggestions that Romney may have committed a felony by misstating his role at Bain Capital in a SEC filing. Romney called the remarks \"outrageous\" and \"beneath the dignity\" of Obama and the presidency. Not only did the president not apologize, he all but scoffed at his foe. Obama did not pawn off the controversy onto his campaign staff or position himself above the fray as a sitting president with much more lofty work to do.Read Post | Comments (1,125)Jedediah Purdy, 07/17/12Professor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027Since Teddy Roosevelt, the steady refrain of American reformers has been that, in a complex society and economy, unrestrained markets cannot do the good that early Americans expected from them, and which market fundamentalists still expect.Read Post | Comments (174)Neil Isford, 07.17.2012VP of Smarter Analytics, IBM North AmericaIt\u0027s a staggering amount to think about: Health care fraud costs the economy about $250 billion every year, according to the FBI.Read Post | Comments (12)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 07/17/12Author, research psychologist, and gender expertModern parents are almost obsessed with filling up their children\u0027s time. There are after-school classes, team sports, camps, lessons.

Better to create your own facts and forge ahead against all odds -- and at any age.Read Post | Comments (27)Arianna Huffington, 07/16/12Barack Obama\u0027s campaign has given us all a crash course on the ills of Bain, but hasn\u0027t given us an alternative narrative of the kind of capitalism that should define the nation as we emerge from the financial crisis -- if, in fact, we ever do.Read Post | Comments (470)Ben Affleck, 07/17/12Academy Award-winning actor and screenwriterDespite recent good news for children in other African nations, in Congo, the numbers are still grim.

The basic problem is not cyclical, it is structural. The time to act is now.Read Post | Comments (115)Jane Friedman, 07/17/12CEO, Open Road Integrated MediaThe public\u0027s heated response to E. L. James\u0027s Fifty Shades trilogy seems to indicate that a book that speaks frankly and passionately about sex is a new invention. But the truth is there are many seductive titles that deserve to be rediscovered.Read Post | CommentsEmily Peck, 07/17/12Managing Editor, HuffPost BusinessA few years ago I desperately needed a raise and only had a few months to get one before my baby bump started to show. I worried that my higher-ups would think that I wasn\u0027t serious about work. The news about Marissa Mayer apparently proves me wrong.Read Post | CommentsDavid Callahan, 07/17/12Senior Fellow, DemosThere are any number of reasons why Romney might not have wanted to sever his ties with Bain. But here\u0027s one that nobody has yet explored: So his wife, Ann, would not lose her health insurance as she battled with multiple sclerosis.Read Post | Comments (80)Robert Greenwald, 07/17/12Filmmaker, Brave New FoundationYou know it\u0027s a big moment for defenders of the United States\u0027 bloated military budget when some of the all-time superstars of the Military-Industrial-Congressional Complex descend on Capitol Hill to fight for their perceived right to profit.Read Post | CommentsDr. Jade Teta, 07/17/12Specialist in natural health, fitness, and body transformation; author, \"The Metabolic Effect Diet\"Weight loss and fat loss are not the same thing. You can be burning calories and losing weight, but those calories and that weight may or may not be fat. In fact, the one-size-fits-all weight loss model of \"eat less and exercise more\" can result in muscle being lost as readily as fat.Read Post | Comments (67)Will Bunch, 07/17/12Author, \u0027The Backlash\u0027John Sununu made an interesting point, and it certainly got me to thinking.

I tried to downplay the risk, but some security experts and journalists sounded alarms.
