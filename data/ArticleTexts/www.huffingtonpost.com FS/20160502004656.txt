{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week the nation got a glimpse of the future, as the frontrunners tipped their hands about what lies in store for us. After big wins in several states, Donald Trump proclaimed, to a sideways glance from Mary Pat Christie, that \"the only card [Clinton] has is the woman\u0027s card.\" Clinton responded by saying, \"If fighting for women\u0027s health care and paid family leave and equal pay is playing the woman card, then deal me in!\" It\u0027s a curious strategy to start off the pivot to the general election by insulting 52 percent of the electorate. Republican women lawmakers responded by urging Trump to nominate a woman as VP. But as insulting as Trump\u0027s comments were, even worse for women are his policies. Policies denying women equal pay and access to reproductive rights are pretty good examples of \"playing the man card.\" What\u0027s clear is that the GOP\u0027s Dais Strategy -- reaching out to a group put off by its policies by bringing a member of that group up on the dais -- isn\u0027t a winning hand.The Republicans know the \"woman card\" well since they\u0027re the ones who invented it. They\u0027ve been playing it since 1984 when the Democrats nominated Geraldine Ferraro for vice president, the first woman to make it onto the ticket of a major American political party.Professor, historian, authorMuch as I applaud the historic diplomatic achievements the Paris Agreement represents, the treaty contains fatal flaws that threaten us and the planet.Founder and Chair, Bianca Jagger Human Rights FoundationThe press is concerned with polls and primaries, numbers of delegates, and the reporter\u0027s hopes for exciting contested conventions. But many faith leaders are concerned with the moral quality of our national discourse -- how much fear, division, and even hate are dominating over trust, compassion, and even love.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersJoining the Uber board, which CEO Travis Kalanick announced last week, represents for me an opportunity to have an impact on a global scale in a way that truly adds value to people\u0027s lives -- which are also priorities for us at The Huffington Post.If there was a real reason to believe that the current system is badly hurting our veterans, and that they would be better cared for under a privatized system, then it would be reasonable to support the transition. But this is the opposite of the reality.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Across America, men and women who were unfairly convicted languish in jails and prisons. Those cases and stories rarely receive any attention from the legal system, the media, and the public. Fortunately for Mac Phipps, the media has taken note and well-known artists have publicly offered him their support.Associate Professor of Law at the University of GeorgiaCommunity activist and Grammy-award winning rapperAssociate Professor of Liberal Arts, University of RichmondYoung people worldwide, who have been more affected than their elders by the financial crisis, identify with one another more than they ever have in the past. They are the #StarWarsGen: just as no one cares where you are from on Endor or Coruscant in Star Wars, for these kids, being from planet earth is enough information, thank you very much.Former President, East Timor, 1996 Nobel Peace Prize laureateExecutive Director of the think tank Youthonomics and CEO of mYgrationCEO of the Stockholm Chamber of CommerceCo-founder of TibbaRev.

The DAPA and expanded DACA initiatives would help parents remain in the U.S. temporarily to work, further their education, and support their families.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundDear Mr. Buffett, if you believe that the Paris climate accord has put us on a path to rapid phase-out of fossil fuels, if you believe that the sun and wind will soon provide all the world\u0027s energy needs, there is little reason for you to say more. But I suspect you agree that more is needed.Climatologist and Adjunct Professor, Columbia University Earth InstituteA design sprint helps teams filter ideas and gain clarity as to which of them are best to pursue.Chairman/CEO, XPRIZEAs part of a global community of journalists and editors who, at least in theory, strive to educate and inform, I was disgusted Thursday to come across a Glamour UK article that in one little gif-filled, navel-gazing story undermined Beyonce\u0027s \"Lemonade\" message.News Editor, The Huffington PostFar more than arcane delegate rules, the two-headed monster of Cruz and Kasich personifies establishment perfidy. Where this goes is plain to see.Novelist and contributing opinion writerWhile we fight to save our planet from the ravages of climate change through the Clean Air Act, international agreements, better fuel mileage standards and clean energy incentives, climate change is already happening.Ranking Member, Senate Environment and Public Works CommitteeI can honestly say I have no idea how many concussions I have had. One reason for that: There was no \"concussion protocol\" when I played, even up until the time I retired in 2005. After a hard hit to the head, you just got up, shook your head, saw some stars and tried to play through it.NFL veteran quarterback, author, HollyRod co-founderIn Maryland: Yes, the \"establishment\" won. Yes, we will soon have an all-male delegation. I can certainly see how that looks from the outside. For those of us inside, however, this was about something other than \"identity politics,\" which Congresswoman Donna Edwards derided as a Republican conceptExecutive Director, Gender Rights MarylandDonald Trump\u0027s first foreign policy speech was an incoherent mess. Let\u0027s start there. He doesn\u0027t even care enough to think up his own thoughts.Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranWhen my kids were little, people would always say, \u0027Enjoy this time. They grow up so quickly.\u0027 And, yes, they were right. But whereas days used to slip away like hours and weeks used to slip away like days, right now our months as a family unit feel as though they\u0027re slipping away like minutes.Senior Editor, The Huffington PostClearly economic insecurity is everyone\u0027s issue: policy makers, business leaders, and educators, not to mention the millions of Americans who wrestle with it every day.Governor of DelawareWhen the Dixie Chicks announced their 2016 tour, I got excited... then got carried away. I can\u0027t wait to welcome them back from a \"Long Time Gone\" in London, cry to \"Cowboy Take Me Away\" in Dublin and sing the ultimate female empowerment anthem, \"Goodbye Earl,\" with my girlfriends in Pennsylvania and Virginia.Writer and editorUnder a Hillary administration, it is likely that more women and people of color will find their way into elite positions within the current political and economic hierarchy. However, her idea of \"breaking all barriers\" does not include breaking the biggest barrier of them all -- runaway inequality.Author, \"Runaway Inequality: An Activist\u0027s Guide to Economic Justice\"With all of the stress that comes with teaching, I think it\u0027s easy to forget all the amazing things I experience as a teacher that would never be the status quo in a \"normal job.\"Christian, writer, teacher, coffee lover.

Please, don\u0027t let another day slip by without connecting with yours.Jessica Wolstenholm is an author and freelance writer who blogs about motherhood and life at graceformoms.comWealth inequality is even more of a problem than income inequality. That\u0027s because you have to have enough savings from income to begin to accumulate wealth -- buying a house or investing in stocks and bonds, or saving up to send a child to college. But many Americans have almost no savings, so they have barely any wealth. Two-thirds live paycheck to paycheck.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027I almost lost my marriage because of you. It was the year my son named Jack was born, and you were born right along with him.WriterDon\u0027t get me wrong, white people are allowed to have opinions and share them, but to attempt to interpret a film and album that was made for and meant to empower black women simply does not make sense.

Lover of coffee, social justice, and Parks and Rec.I see a man who has committed every fiber of his being to keeping our family together. It suddenly occurred to me that my heart wasn\u0027t the only one that ached over the past few months. His did, too. Despite that, he has carried on with the calm, steady manner that I always recognized, but never realized was so vital to our relationship.Mom, medical professional, wife and proud driver of \"The Struggle Bus\"The message at the heart of Junction 48 is that Palestinians do not need the patronizing help of Western liberals; even less do they need the silence about \"honor killing\" as part of the Western leftist\u0027s \"respect\" for Palestinian ways of life. These two aspects are the two sides of the same ideological mystification.Slovenian philosopher and psychoanalystEvery Mother\u0027s Day I get asked what I want.
