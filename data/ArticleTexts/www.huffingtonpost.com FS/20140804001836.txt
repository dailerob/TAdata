{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week Congress lived down to the standards we\u0027ve come to expect. First, House Republicans voted to sue President Obama for using executive authority to delay implementation of the health care law they\u0027ve held over 50 votes to repeal. Then, after a revolt in their own ranks, House leadership withdrew their bill to deal with the border crisis -- then issued a jaw-dropping statement urging the president to (wait for it... ) use executive authority \"without congressional action.\" But on Friday, after worsening an already bad bill by weakening protections for the children at the center of the crisis, they finally passed a symbolic and useless package -- useless since their Republican counterparts in the Senate already torpedoed that chamber\u0027s $2.7 billion border crisis bill. Their \"work\" done, they recessed for a five-week vacation -- during which they will no doubt fundraise, using the \"crisis\" they\u0027ve failed to address as fodder. If only we could issue an executive order to put an end to this nonsense.With the exception of a few courageous journalists, the American view of Gaza -- the posture of looking away with pity and calling it \"heartbreaking\" as if the wild disparity of deaths did not exist -- has been an abortion of moral responsibility. It testifies to a poverty of leadership almost as desperate as that of the Israelis and the Palestinians half a world away.Professor of Literature, Yale UniversityI was raised to be against any act of violence, and the consequent suffering of humanity for it, regardless of religions, ethnicities and borders.Academy Award-winning actorThe two guys at the top of national security (the Director of National Intelligence and the director of the CIA) have both been caught lying to the American people and to the U.S. Senate -- they have no right to lie.Host, Fox News\u0027 \u0027On the Record With Greta Van Susteren\u0027Who\u0027s us? Who\u0027s them? Increasingly, corporate nationality is whatever a corporation decides it is. So instead of worrying about who\u0027s American and who\u0027s not, here\u0027s a better idea: Create incentives for any global company to do what we\u0027d like it to do in the United States.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027It should be possible to say that we should continue with the movement toward the decriminalization of marijuana. And we should also be able to say that as we decriminalize, we should take every step possible to minimize the harm, since there is scientific evidence of the dangers of pot on adolescents and young adults.We are very good about passing along information that inflames our passions of outrage. Can we be as good about passing along an invitation to share A Moment of Peace?Executive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostNothing should be off limits to discussion. No, let me amend that. If you think some things should be off limits, let\u0027s sit down together and discuss that proposition itself. Let\u0027s not just insult each other and cut off all discussion because we rationalists have somehow wandered into a land where emotion is king.Biologist and writerThe war will eventually come to an end. The question is: Will the terms for ending the bloody conflict set the stage for the next round of hostilities, or will both sides shed their delusions, recognize each other and stop this vicious cycle of violence?Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUOur celebrity culture has turned us all into armchair therapists who put even our president on the couch to analyze his personality flaws. But when the label of \"detached\" acquires a political spin, it\u0027s no longer just nonsense. It becomes dangerous.Co-Director, Foreign Policy In FocusWhen women take note of sexism during their daily lives -- for example, talking openly about street harassment or workplace bias -- and name it for what it is, they stop accepting it as \"normal.\"Feminist, writer, and satirist (not always in that order)Given the choice between immigrants entering the U.S. with a path to citizenship or Hannity and Perry with their smirky, middle-aged, white, itchy trigger fingers, faux badassery and gun fetishes, I\u0027ll take the immigrants in a heartbeat. So should we all.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027In the face of the ongoing aggression, the ensuing humanitarian crisis, and the political stalemate between Israel and Hamas, I have written this letter to my former congressional colleagues.Former 16-year member of the U.S. Congress and two-time U.S. presidential candidateThe sitting Parliament, where at least half the delegates can be qualified as unprincipled populists at best and outright criminals at worst, is incapable of acting on behalf of the people, and it must be dissolved.Member of the Ukrainian Parliament (Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine)The place he needs to start is to put a stop to the Keystone pipeline foolishness once and for all. This carbon-maximizing project that allows investors like the Koch brothers to make billions while screwing up the Canadian wilderness so that oil can be sold to China is a disaster in every way.Co-Founder, Democracy PartnersAre you \"pro-Israel\" or \"pro-Palestine\"? It isn\u0027t even noon yet as I write this, and I\u0027ve already been accused of being both.Pakistani-Canadian writer, physician and musicianYou have about 4,500 weeks to live, and seeing them all on one image is a weird experience.waitbutwhy.com\"You can say no,\" I find myself saying to family after family -- which is kind of an amazing thing to have to say, if you think about itPediatrician, Boston Children\u0027s Hospital, Harvard Medical SchoolI love what Hollywood could be, but I must say that I don\u0027t love what it is. I can\u0027t accept that while my daily life is filled with black and brown women, they are completely absent, erased, when I look at a TV or movie screen.Poet, author, and activistYou\u0027ve got to wonder: What would motivate creatures from other worlds to suffer a journey of hundreds of trillions of miles to visit our planet? Why bother? I\u0027ve been asked this question at least a half-dozen times by Hollywood writers, and the best answer I can muster is \"I don\u0027t know.\"Senior Astronomer, SETI InstituteThe besieged Jews of the Warsaw ghetto had a motto \"to live and die in dignity.\" As I sit in my own besieged ghetto, I think how Palestinians have honored this universal value. We live in dignity and we die in dignity, refusing to accept subjugation.Palestinian human rights worker in GazaWhat we know: Having women in the boardroom is a good thing. But are more women a better thing? That depends, of course, on how they get there.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarAs parents, we lie all the time -- about the Easter Bunny or Santa or the Tooth Fairy, about how long 10 minutes is, about whether or not we remembered they wanted to have grilled cheese for dinner again. We lie a lot. But one thing I never lie about is sex.Writer and toddler-wrangler at Becoming SuperMommyIt\u0027s time for our institutions to scrap their crisis communication plans when it comes to violence against women, and replace them with real plans to protect victims and hold perpetrators accountable.President and CEO, National Network to End Domestic ViolenceNormally, higher unemployment is bad news, and people seeing \"HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT\" on the evening news tonight will naturally assume the worst. But this time, unemployment actually rose for a good reason. Here\u0027s why.Chief financial writer, The Huffington PostI always found it interesting how people could have such strong opinions about a couple of people and a dog they\u0027ve never met. Fear is an interesting thing. Do we listen to that fear and euthanize Wallace to guarantee that he never hurts anybody? Or do we take our chances?Founder/CEO, Wallce the Pit Bull FoundationOnly the United Nations General Assembly can mobilize world opinion. Nothing else seems likely to break the deadlock.Former British foreign secretaryOur fairly recent reliance on prisons and homelessness as solutions to mental illness was the common fashion 200 years ago but now seems anachronistic and indecent in a society that has the tools and can afford to do much better.Professor Emeritus, Duke UniversitySadly, my kids will never know the joys of rolling freely around the back of a station wagon or eating Twinkies as part of a healthy lunch. Writer, editor, and radio host; blogger, mommyklatch.blogspot.comWhile I\u0027ve been a true believer and I\u0027ve perpetuated the belief in hard work as the great poverty buster, now when I talk to some of them I feel that I\u0027ve perpetuated a great fraud upon them.Veteran high school teacher and basketball coach; author, \u0027Students First and Other Lies\u0027This is one of those things that non-teachers don\u0027t entirely get. If you work in an office, time is pretty flexy. If a meeting can benefit by running an extra 10 or 15 minutes, you just do it. But in most schools, when the bell rings, you\u0027re done. There is no little extra bit of time you can just throw into the work.Teacher and writer; blogger, curmudgucation.blogspot.comGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"ISRAEL WITHDRAWS",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
