{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week delivered another stark lesson in the difference between a real scandal and a manufactured one. On Tuesday, President Obama was photographed at the Nelson Mandela memorial service taking a selfie with British Prime Minister David Cameron and Danish PM Helle Thorning-Schmidt, thus kicking off #selfiegate. This happened just before the president apparently destroyed America by shaking hands with Cuban President Raul Castro -- at a ceremony honoring a man for, among other things, rising above old hatreds and promoting reconciliation between former enemies. Attracting far less social media fury was the fact that an estimated 28,000 people, including almost 200 children, have been killed by gun violence in the year since Newtown -- or that under the Murray-Ryan budget deal being worked out, extended unemployment benefits for 1.3 million Americans will abruptly end on December 28. Maybe for Christmas, we should all ask Santa for a more well-placed sense of outrage.Comments (29)Alissa ParkerBlogger, TheParkerFive and co-founder, safeandsoundschools.orgIt has been one year since I saw my sweet little Emilie. I will be honest, I hate when the media comes into town. I don\u0027t like seeing their vans with large satellite dishes parked on every corner. I don\u0027t like seeing my daughter\u0027s picture on the news associated with her violent death.Comments (98)Diane ScottExecutive Vice President, Chief Product and Marketing Officer, Western UnionTexts, email, social media--in a society that feels over-connected, this time of year many of us crave more meaningful connections. Prior to joining Western Union, checking in with distant loved ones was prompted by the aroma of a Thanksgiving turkey or a birthday reminder on my calendar. Today, helping people connect is the core of what I do, and I get to learn this skill from some of the very best.CommentsKatie CouricCancer advocate; Host of \u0027Katie\u0027; and Award-Winning JournalistI know there is a segment of the population that has expressed intense concern over vaccines in general and that this is an emotional issue for some. But based on the science, my personal view is that the benefits of the HPV vaccine far outweigh its risks.Comments (295)Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCODuring his nearly three decades of often-cruel imprisonment, Mr. Mandela was repeatedly offered his personal freedom provided he agreed to conditions that limited the freedom of others. Every single time, he refused.CommentsKirk DouglasActorToday is my 97th birthday. I am a lucky man. I\u0027ve been married to my wife, Anne, for 60 years and she continues to captivate me. When you get to be 97, you can reflect on the lessons you\u0027ve learned in almost a century of life.Comments (253)Arianna HuffingtonIn this week\u0027s issue, Bianca Bosker tells the story of how one man uncovered the secrets of Syria\u0027s chemical warfare against its citizens.CommentsDavid RockDirector, NeuroLeadership InstituteResearch is beginning to have us question where we put our attention as a society, questioning what we should care about. If we want to avoid any kind of derailing, perhaps it\u0027s time we all paid more attention to sleep.Comments (11)Josh SugarmannExecutive director, Violence Policy CenterMuch will be said in the coming days about how successful advocates have been in achieving their goals since 12/14. And make no mistake: Given the opposition we face, we cannot expect to win overnight.Comments (257)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundOne year later, despite Congress\u0027s appalling lack of action, there has been important progress in some areas and states. The White House has quietly delivered on most of the executive actions President Obama promised in the aftermath of the Newtown shooting.Comments (51)Paul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostLapsed Catholic, atheist and people of other religions have all declared themselves a fan of this Pope. And, as a Baptist minister so have I. Pope Francis is the religious figure that the world has been waiting for.Comments (117)Bill MoyersManaging Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyWhy are record numbers of Americans on food stamps? Because record numbers of Americans are in poverty. Why are people falling through the cracks? Because there are cracks to fall through.Comments (378)Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde and Bishop Ian T. DouglasIt is long past time to pass legislation that will expand background checks and other modest measures that will save lives and assuage even a small portion of the grief caused by gun violence that has become a staple of our pastoral duties and our prayers.Comments (118)TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"What if you could spend your summers swimming with dolphins in turquoise seas? Behavioral biologist Denise Herzing does just that. In this beautiful video, meet some of the dolphins she\u0027s befriended along the way.Comments (58)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027Congress ends its December session today, and we will break down the tent. But this is not the end of the Fast for Families; it is only the beginning. It\u0027s time to take our movement deeper, take this nation deeper, and take our political debate to a much deeper level.Comments (31)Josh Silver and Mansur GidfarAs an anti-corruption advocate, I don\u0027t have a position on derivatives trading. What I do have a position on is corruption, and H.R. 992 is a textbook case of the way corruption has turned the People\u0027s House into an auction house.Comments (55)Ben FoldsLeader of Ben Folds FiveSchools are cutting their music programs in an attempt to save money. But wait. A crazy thing is happening. This next generation of students is filling the musical education void by just doing it themselves.Comments (16)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarThe great thing about celebrity narcissism is that we hold the clicker. When we\u0027ve had enough, we can simply move on to another distraction. In our lives, the closer the narcissist is, the hard it is to escape the vortex.CommentsBrian Levin, J.D.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityNothing says SEXY better than a poster of a scantily clad woman in Nazi garb standing outside of what appears to be a Photoshopped concentration camp. That is the world of Tila Tequila on the web today.Comments (85)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistThe holidays are the perfect time of year to gather with our loved ones, flip through favorite family photo albums and reflect on cherished memories. In my home, it would be nearly impossible to find a photo from the best years of my life without my husband, Phil, right by my side.CommentsAlan ColmesLiberal political commentator, host of \"The Alan Colmes Show\" on Fox News Radio, publisher of alan.com, author of \"Thank the Liberals … For Saving America\"While those horrible blue-staters are doing all they can to stop patriots like Sarah Palin and her Tea Party friends from celebrating Christmas, try being a Jew during Christmas in America. And see if you can find anything to eat besides General Tso\u0027s chicken.Comments (85)Jennifer MeerMother and writer at my-jenneration.blogspot.comDecember has always been a miraculous time. It marks the season in my life when I labored with both my children on the same date, in different years: December 14. But I cannot help but think of a community not so very far from my own. December 14 marks a very different day for them.CommentsNoah MichelsonEditor, HuffPost Gay VoicesWhat\u0027s got me so despondent (and dramatic)? A couple of recent blog posts that appeared on HuffPost Gay Voices, lamenting, worrying about or lashing out at queers (like me) who don\u0027t want to live a heteronormative life.Comments (247)Dennis J. KucinichFmr. 16-year Member of US Congress; Two-time US Presidential CandidateIn a country where the average monthly minimum wage stands at about $150 USD, it\u0027s not hard to understand why Ukrainians are in the streets. But is their plight being exploited to usher in a new military agreement under the guise of economic reform?Comments (44)Lyz LenzWriterI realize I\u0027m writing a defense of consumerism. A treatise on spoiling. But it\u0027s one day. One day I can say \"yes.\"Comments (75)Tommy G. ThompsonFormer Gov. of Wisconsin and Sec. of the Department of Health and Human ServiceWhile the Affordable Care Act continues to badly stumble out of the gate, it is instructive to look at the last major change to our health care system -- the addition of a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program.Comments (77)Raquel D\u0027ApiceStand-up comic and writer of \u0027The Ugly Volvo\u0027 blogI am a 10-month-old baby and I write because my mother has been sending out my \"Christmas List\" to people, and her list does not in any way represent the things I really want. I could give two s#*ts about receiving stacking cups.Comments (21)Dominique de VillepinFmr. Prime Minster of FranceNow is the time for a new globalization, that can be either multipolar, based on fair development, stability and innovation or confrontational, based on privileges, speculation and inequities. This means making choices and changes in many sectors: let\u0027s begin with credit rating.CommentsJessica Ann MitchellWriter for OurLegaci.com and founder of Black Bloggers ConnectThis defense obviously doesn\u0027t work for black and poor youth. Yet, news outlets are spiraling about 16-year-old Ethan Couch who caused the deaths of four people by drunk driving. His defense was that he suffered from \"Affluenza\" -- a disorder that only the affluent have.Comments (68)Suzy StrutnerFellow, Huffington Post TravelFried okra is a vegetable. ...and so are fried onions.Comments (361)Jim HigleyBobblehead Dad; Author; Speaker; Parenting Columnist; Radio Host; Cancer WarriorOne of the things I\u0027ve learned is that being an effective dad requires strong communications with your child. If you can nail that part of the dad job, the rest comes much easier. A daunting task for sure -- especially as kids get older. So, here are my three top tips to help you grease that two-way road to trust-filled communications with your children.Comments (65)Laura W. MurphyDirector, ACLU Washington Legislative OfficeInnocent Americans should never have to worry their government\u0027s awesome surveillance capabilities are intercepting, filtering, collecting, analyzing, and storing the intimate details of their lives. Appallingly, they do.Comments (24)Gary Hart, 2013.15.12Peter Gorman, 2013.15.12Dr. Charles G. Cogan, 2013.15.12Dan Miles, 2013.15.12Amber Elliott, 2013.15.12Bernice A.
