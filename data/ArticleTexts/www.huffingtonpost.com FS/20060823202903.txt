{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"APFrom washingtonpost.comAPFrom tvsquad.comHillary Clinton is meeting with Ned Lamont in the next few days on her home turf in Chappaqua. As usual, Hillary is precariously balancing on the tip of a triangulation strategy. She\u0027s offered Lamont her perfunctory \"following the will of the people\" support but she\u0027s not raising money for him and she\u0027s yet to schedule any campaign appearances with him. It\u0027s not by accident that their meeting is in Chappaqua, not Connecticut. The mountain/Mohammad casting is clear. But triangulation isn\u0027t really an option this time around when the GOP is doing all it can to ensure a Lieberman victory. Republicans already know how to beat Lieberman Democrats (see 2000, 2002, and 2004). Lamont Democrats are a whole different story. Hillary has to choose.READ POST | comments (36)08.23.2006 Bill MaherREAD POST | comments (48)08.23.2006 Melissa LafskyIn a word, Bruno\u0027s words were flooring.
