{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Howard FinemanEditorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupElijah Cummings, 62 years old, has lived and seen the best -- and the worst -- of what this country means, offers and does to a black man. He knows the promise and pain of Black America. His parents were Southern sharecroppers who moved to Baltimore for a better life. The budding civil rights movement was active in the city, and schools and public facilities became integrated when he was a boy. They were excellent, and he went on to become student body president at Howard University, earned a law degree and now serves as a Democrat in the House. The story of Elijah Cummings is a story of Black America in the summer of 2013: rising visibility and achievement, power in high places, but also renewed focus on the persistence, or decay, of conditions on the streets and in the homes of African Americans. We aren\u0027t living in the colorblind, post-racial society we hoped a black president might usher in, not when success is so split along color lines.Comments (13,601)Catherine WileyAssistant Professor of English, Temple UniversityI was introduced to the concept of white privilege in 1984, when I was 19, in college. I was having lunch with my first love, a black man, in a diner in central Ohio.Comments (407)Jon HotchkissCreator, ThisvsThatShow.comThe one and only thing men fear during pregnancy is that during sex, they will poke the baby in the head with their penis. Amazing, right?Comments (309)Steve KarrasStaff Writer, Web2Carz.comEnjoy settling in to your new \"digs\" at one of your family\u0027s many palaces. Eat, smile and repeat \"mummy\" for as long as you can and remember this, you don\u0027t pick your family, but you can pick out anything else you want. Don\u0027t worry, your family can afford it.Comments (12)Dr Raj Persaud and Dr Nicholas MorrisYou might consider that being born a royal means you are born lucky - are some people indeed born lucky? The luckiest people alive - or at least people who believe they are lucky - are born in May. The Royal baby, it appears, has missed out being born in May by around two months - how unlucky is that?Comments (17)Gov. Jack MarkellGovernor of DelawareOn July 17, I signed into law a bill enabling the formation of a new type of corporation that is hard wired to compete to be the best in America at being the best for America. These new Delaware public benefit corporations will harness the power of private enterprise to create public benefit.Comments (33)Judith EllisEntrepreneurThe burden of the minority to explain to the majority the system under which power has been exercised to denigrate, humiliate and confiscate their very right to exist alongside others equally is most certainly not merely a thing of the past.Comments (106)Marty KaplanDirector, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolYou wouldn\u0027t realize from these campaign-style ads that what\u0027s really at stake is money. Your money. Both CBS and TWC want more of it. They\u0027re probably going to get it. The only issue -- which this battle is about -- is how they\u0027ll divvy up what they pick from our pockets.Comments (26)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkTrayvon Martin went to store to buy Skittles and an iced tea. Trayvon Martin was shot dead by a civilian who had no authority to stop him. Trayvon Martin\u0027s killer wasn\u0027t arrested for weeks until after the horrible incident. Those are facts. And facts cannot be denied no matter how they may be twisted or spun.Comments (207)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027If countries are allowed to act as tax havens against a financial speculation tax or any other measure it is because the administration in Washington is content to let them act as tax havens. When it actually wants something to happen, the Obama administration, like its predecessors, is prepared to do a full Snowden.CommentsGeoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoEven though, as President Obama observed, things are better for African Americans in our nation today than when he was the age of Trayvon Martin when he died, the moral crisis of racism remains an open wound. We should not kid ourselves. Things have gotten better, but they are still shameful.Comments (727)Wendy BrandesFine jewelry designer and fashion bloggerAre you finally ready to try skinny jeans but wondering if the trend has already passed you by? After all, no less a wit than Oscar Wilde declared \"Fashion is ephemeral. Art is eternal,\" in an 1885 newspaper essay called \"The Philosophy of Dress.\"CommentsEduardo PaesMayor, Rio de Janeiro, BrazilDemocracy has to reinvent itself in accordance with this new \"liquid society\" where collaboration happens between many millions of people directly. Leadership is not vertical, as in the past, but horizontal.CommentsCourtney HardyAccount Executive at FOX40My sophomore biology class was studying genetics when I learned, by accident, that I was adopted. As my teacher explained that two blue-eyed parents would never have a brown-eyed child. I raised my hand, happy to be the exception.Comments (39)Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Larry Summers is running hard to succeed Ben Bernanke as chairman of the Federal Reserve. This is a terrible idea. Once appointed chief of economic policy, Summers with Tim Geithner was a prime architect of propping up and bailing out the biggest banks, rather than cleaning them out and altering the conflicts of interest at the core of Wall Street\u0027s business model.Comments (135)Lisa RubischTV commercial directorMy style was cultivated out of a need to rebel against the conservative, preppy sameness of my hometown. It never occurred to me that my son would grow up to rebel against me.Comments (27)Paul CheungThe names were supposed to be a joke. Only this joke wasn\u0027t funny. It was offensive, insensitive to the victims of Asiana\u0027s plane crash, and indicative of a major problem in a government and journalism institution. These \u0027jokes\u0027 make me question my American-ness.Comments (17)Ted KaufmanFmr. U.S. Senator from DelawareFailure was built into Dodd-Frank from the beginning. Instead of writing laws that addressed the abuses that led to the crisis, it nearly always kicked the can down to agencies, instructing them to write new regulations.Comments (133)Romany MalcoActorWhen we signed on to do reality shows that fed into the media\u0027s stereotypes of black men, we ingrained an image of Trayvon Martin so overwhelming that who he actually may have been didn\u0027t matter anymore.Comments (2,322)The Daily MealTheDailyMeal.comThe finest steakhouses the country has to offer: must-visits for even the most casual carnivore.Comments (101)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The geo-political divide has become so palpable that being wealthy in America today means not having to come across anyone who isn\u0027t.Comments (1,040)Paul MecurioEmmy Award-winning comedian, host of The Paul Mecurio ShowI spoke with Sir Paul, about everything from music to comedy to raising kids to ... well, you\u0027ll have to listen to what the man said.CommentsMike LuxCo-Founder, Democracy PartnersDetroit\u0027s bondholder-friendly, worker/retiree-unfriendly bankruptcy tells the story of an economy -- and a society -- where the priorities are completely screwed up. This is not how you build a healthy sustainable economy.Comments (12)Baba BrinkmanRap artist, playwrightLike the Golden Rule, \"Don\u0027t Sleep With Mean People\" is easier to embrace in principle than in practice, but also like the Golden Rule it can make a difference even if you fall short of perfection.CommentsLizbeth MateoOrganizer, National Immigrant Youth AllianceIf immigration reform passes, we cannot leave out the millions of people whose families have been separated by deportation. They deserve to be home, and if we win, they may come home soon.Comments (79)Subhankar BanerjeeFounder, ClimateStoryTellers.orgEquipped with Atlases on the ground, backed by drones in the sky, and real-time global surveillance--the US government will soon be ready to announce: \"Resistance is futile.\"Comments (78)Norman SolomonAuthor, \u0027War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death\u0027Journalists who can be compelled to violate the confidentiality of their sources, or otherwise go to prison, are reduced to doing little more than providing stenographic services to pass along the official story. That\u0027s what the White House wants.Comments (59)Jack MirkinsonMedia Editor, The Huffington PostEven though we know it\u0027s all going to fall apart, the story of the supposed American war crime in Pakistan continues to intrigue. It\u0027s somewhat encouraging that it is the framing around which the entire season appears to be based.Comments (58)Kate SpencerWriter, producerOur cultural conversation about pregnancy, birth and motherhood is way off from what the actual experience is. And it\u0027s hurting women.Comments (140)Leo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersBanks are corporations, which are legal entities established under rules written by people. Their existence should advance America and Americans. Not the other way around. Many in Congress need to be reminded of that.Comments (57)Mike WeisserThe Gun GuyHave you noticed how each side in the current argument about guns has a favorite statistic that they like to throw around? Does anyone know where these numbers come from? Here\u0027s the answer.Comments (374)Zev Yaroslavsky, 2013.22.07Simple. Thrifty.
