{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, the Senate released its report on America\u0027s use of torture after 9/11. The revelations were appalling: a detainee being chained naked to the floor and dying of exposure, another forced to stand on broken legs, more widespread use of waterboarding than previously known, and forced \"rectal hydration\" (in other contexts, known as rape). And not only did the CIA mislead Congress, but its claims -- repeated this week -- about the program\u0027s effectiveness were also unsupported by the evidence. It was a small step in accounting for one of the most shameful episodes in U.S. history. But it\u0027s not enough to, as the president did, simply say we won\u0027t do it again. The larger question is: Why aren\u0027t the program\u0027s architects being prosecuted? The methods used, the president said, are \"inconsistent with our values as a nation.\" And so is placing some people above the law for political expediency. Thankfully, there is no statute of limitations on torture.It is scarcely believable to imagine a world without elephants, rhinos, lions or tigers. Yet time is running out to save these creatures from being consigned to the history books and to stories of days gone by.Duke of Cambridge and President of United for WildlifeThese are more than jarring statistics that tug at our heartstrings. They are emblematic of a looming water crisis that will directly impact us all.ActorU.S. Representative from OregonGreetings from India, where I\u0027m thrilled to announce we\u0027re launching our latest international edition, in collaboration with The Times of India Group and its digital arm, Times Internet (TIL). Beyond its 1.24 billion people, India is vast in every way -- its history, its colors, its food, its spiritual traditions, the billions of stories of its people, its contradictions.I have forgotten most of them, and so has the public. However, I am proud of the ones I will tell you about. A few are sentimental favorites that mark meaningful times in my off-screen life and milestones in my rise to stardom. Others are meaningful to me because they also gave insight into serious issues.Actor, author of 10 books and a book of poems \"Life Could Be Verse” to be published by HCI, December 2014A half-century later, my father\u0027s words are still powerful, still relevant. Justice, racial equality, and the Beloved Community that he often described are still, to paraphrase Victor Hugo, ideas whose time has come. In fact, their time is long overdue.Chief Executive Officer, The King CenterWhen you ask why are so many people out in the street, I\u0027d say we\u0027ve reached a tipping point, in the original, pre-Malcolm Gladwell use of the term. The scale that\u0027s tipping, simply, is justice. It was already going over when the torture report hit like a ton of bricks.Author, \u0027Tear Down This Myth\u0027Consider these the early slush of the coming Republican winter, the first returns on investment for their donors. Tucked into the 1,603-page bill to fund the government -- that no legislator will read -- are cankerous riders, foreshadowing what is to come.President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureThere has been a suggestion in recent days that now is not a good time to release a review prepared by the Senate Intelligence Committee of the CIA\u0027s detention and interrogation program. But is there ever a good time to admit our country tortured people?U.S. Senator from CaliforniaThe threat of climate change is screaming at us. We must approach this global threat with the urgency that it warrants. We must work together, rich nations and developing nations as well, to avoid the instability and vulnerability that will surely befall us if we fail to heed the warning on climate change.U.S. Secretary of StateIf US officials tortured people, and we know torture is, was and always has been illegal, why isn\u0027t the government prosecuting them? Maybe there\u0027s some complicated legal reason that isn\u0027t obvious to most of us why the evidence wouldn\u0027t hold up in court. If so, it\u0027s in the government\u0027s interest to explain what that is.Senior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstMany white Americans tend to see this problem as unfortunate incidents based on individual circumstances. Black Americans see a system in which their black lives matter less than white lives. The question is: Are we white people going to listen or not?Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersSo let\u0027s cut the talk of fundamental American values that the rest of the world should admire. Obama may not want to dwell on the past, but history will, and his legacy on torture will be one of acceptance.Host/Producer, HuffPost LiveIf you\u0027re a Congressperson looking to sneak through something shady, the omnibus budget bill is the perfect opportunity since 1) It\u0027s 1600 pages long and relatively easy to hide things in, and 2) Congress has to pass it or the government shuts down. Again.Director, Represent.UsThis year, I ask you all to honor my mother\u0027s life with action. I ask you all to take one small step to honor her, and all of the others whose lives were taken far too soon by gun violence.Daughter of slain Sandy Hook Elementary School Principal Dawn Hochsprung, outreach associate at Everytown for Gun SafetyNelson Mandela, who founded The Elders in 2007, believed transformative leaders needed the generosity and courage to see beyond narrow self-interest. No challenge requires these qualities as much, or as urgently, as climate change.Chair of the Kofi Annan Foundation and The EldersFormer President of Mexio, Member of The EldersBody shaming is a part of American culture, at once abhorrent and everywhere. Women are shamed for being fat, skinny, tall, short, flat chested, busty, too plain, too sexy. But lately, there seems to be a different response from women -- frustration followed by acceptance and moving on.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarThe truth is that torture did work, but not the way its defenders claim. It worked to produce justifications for policies the establishment wanted, like the Iraq war.Communications director, Institute for Public AccuracyEmploying this many workers may make the company seem virtuous and altruistic, but the business model is not a model other companies should emulate.Communications Director, Brave New FoundationWe intend to continue making documentary series and films and writing blogs about human rights. We\u0027ll be announcing another one soon. But all this talk is useless unless we band together and act.Writer-Director, How To Make Money Selling DrugsProducer, How To Make Money Selling DrugsSuccessful companies like Apple need to make fundamental changes to the way they allocate resources and stop throwing away America\u0027s most valuable asset for future innovation -- you.Author and cultural theoristDo not be silent. Do not be complacent. Do not continue to live with police misconduct and violence as somehow acceptable. We are not anti-police; we are anti-police-brutality. And today we challenge Congress to follow in the president\u0027s footsteps and take legislative action to protect us, the citizens.President, National Action NetworkOn December 10th President Obama hosted a White House Summit on Early Education, bringing together a broad coalition of philanthropic, business, education, child advocacy and elected leaders and other key stakeholders.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe reason Democrats have pulled their punches with the financial sector for years is because it\u0027s hard to punch the hand that feeds you. This must stop. America can\u0027t tackle widening inequality without confronting the power and privilege lying behind it.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027MEMORANDUM: Please do not eat those little mini hot dogs while calling the President socialist, fascist, communist, or other words ending in -st, as saliva-saturated, half-chewed food remnants tend to travel quickly from one\u0027s angrily-frothing lips.Congressman from New York\u0027s 3rd Congressional District; Author of the forthcoming book \u0027The Global War On Morris\u0027Elections are behind us, and many new state legislative sessions don\u0027t begin until January -- yet lawmakers are already giving us a preview of the bills they intend to pass into law first chance they get.President of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Planned Parenthood Action Fund and Planned Parenthood VotesThis past Saturday night, Robin and I went to Santa Barbara for a private screening of the soon-to-be released movie \"Selma.\" An Oprah project. This movie is about you, and it is about me, and you absolutely must see it.Author, Host \"Dr. Phil\"We are not taking urgent action. Nature does not negotiate, it responds to our intransigence. For the people of the Philippines, and in many other parts of the world, climate change is already a catastrophe.Executive Director, Greenpeace InternationalI never wanted you here. You simply were never part of the plan. Growing up and dreaming of my family I never included you. I didn\u0027t want help from another woman to raise my child. But then you arrived. Dang your kind smile! I was planing on really hating you. I wanted to resent you but you made it impossible.Founder, Women With WorthIn light of history repeating itself so completely, one must ask where did all these millions of dollars go if, 12 years later, the very same mistakes, blunders and oversights are being made?Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorI fear that the dubious claims by this latest report simply complicate prospects for having the very important and necessary conversation about what measures California will need to take to deal with what is likely to be a steadily worsening water crisis. That is no small matter.Director of Penn State Earth System Science Center; Author of \u0027Dire Predictions\u0027 and \u0027The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars\u0027Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"I\u0027D TORTURE AGAIN!",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
