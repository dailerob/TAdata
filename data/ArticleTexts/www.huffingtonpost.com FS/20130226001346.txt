{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupThe downside of this Celebrity Presidency is not yet known. But it will be tested this spring and summer in a series of budget crises that amount to a reality show drama about leadership -- with real-world consequences for all Americans. President Barack Obama is facing a Washington version of Wall Street\u0027s \"triple-witching hour,\" a pileup of fateful deadlines in tight sequence. He\u0027ll be hit with the $85 billion sequester cuts likely to begin Friday, a possible government-wide shutdown if no deal is reached on the overall budget by March 27 and yet another collision over the debt ceiling this summer. So the show\u0027s plot is simple: Can a popular president, recently reelected and reigning supreme culturally and socially, master -- for the sake of prosperity and his vision of a just society -- the sclerotic tribal dynamics of Washington?Read Post | Comments (37)Mitchell Bard, 02/24/13Writer and FilmmakerRepublicans in Congress are willing to take the pocketbooks of the American people hostage, all to try and ransom spending and entitlement cuts that would, in the opinion of many economists, cause further economic damage to all but the wealthiest Americans.Read Post | Comments (1,576)Jerry Cuomo, 02.25.2013IBM FellowAbout four years ago, we started hiring high school interns. The idea was to introduce basic software development skills and help create interest in the field. What we didn\u0027t anticipate was how much we\u0027d learn in the process. In many ways, the teachers became the students, and the experience continues to transform the way we view risk, reward -- and the user experience.Read Post | CommentsDr. Dean Ornish, 02/25/13Medical editor, The Huffington Post; Founder and president, Preventive Medicine Research InstituteAn article just published in the New England Journal of Medicine claims that a Mediterranean diet is much more effective than a \"low-fat diet\" in preventing cardiovascular disease. A careful reading of the study reveals that this is simply not true.Read Post | Comments (155)Michelangelo Signorile, 02/25/13Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesIt\u0027s unlikely that Pope Benedict resigned because he was pushed out by an all-powerful \"gay lobby\" within the Vatican; it\u0027s more probable that that at 85 years old, he is simply not up to the task of purging the church of the secret gays whom the Vatican sees as the cause of its problems.Read Post | Comments (58)Anna Leahy and Douglas Dechow, 02/24/13If we can hear the constituents of the universe, we must remember that we, too, are part of this universe.

Professor, Univ. of Missouri, Kansas City; Sr. regulator during S\u0026L debacleThere is a clear answer to how to help our nation.
