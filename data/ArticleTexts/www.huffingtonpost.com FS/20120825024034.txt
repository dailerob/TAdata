{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Host of HBO\u0027s \"Real Time with Bill Maher\"Republicans would like to pretend like Congressman Akin\u0027s substitution of superstition for science is a lone problem but it\u0027s not: they\u0027re all magical thinkers, on nearly every issue. They don\u0027t get their answers on climate change from climatologists, they get them from the Book of Genesis. Hence Sharia Law in America is a dire threat, and global warming a hoax. How do they get away with it? They know that, because we\u0027re already such a religious country, our minds are primed for magical, fantasy thinking. The gullibility comes factory-installed.
