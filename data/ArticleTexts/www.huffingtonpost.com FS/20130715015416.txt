{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week was a week of comebacks, some welcome, some less so. At the U.N., Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani teen who was shot by the Taliban for promoting girls\u0027 education, marked her 16th birthday by giving an inspiring speech. Less welcome was the comeback by the Texas anti-choice bill, which passed on Friday. In Moscow, accused NSA leaker Edward Snowden emerged at Moscow\u0027s Sheremetyevo airport to ask Russia for asylum. Closer to home, former governor Eliot Spitzer announced his bid for New York City comptroller, and former New Jersey governor Jim McGreevey joined the Jersey City cabinet. And that\u0027s a good thing -- further restricting our pool of leaders to flawless robots won\u0027t help us meet our challenges. Speaking of challenges, the unlikely Senate duo of Elizabeth Warren and John McCain introduced a bill pushing for Glass-Steagall to make a comeback. Passage is considered unlikely, but, then, so was the unlikely pairing of sharks and tornadoes. Until now.Comments (25)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe outrage over the killing of an unarmed Black teenager who was doing nothing wrong must continue until some semblance of justice is achieved. Let us refuse to be silent until the killing of Black mothers\u0027 sons is as important as the killing of White mothers\u0027 sons.Comments (198)Judith Browne DianisCo-Director, Advancement ProjectThe movement must not stop with this verdict but continue on until each and every young man of color in America can walk the streets in any of our nation\u0027s neighborhoods unafraid, knowing not only that he is safe, but that his country walks beside him.Comments (911)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkUntil we, the people of this nation, unite as one and continue fighting for expanded equality for all of God\u0027s children so that they may in fact be free from persecution, discrimination and the shackles of inequality, a post-racial America will only be a comfort on the lips of those seeking to advance themselves.Comments (712)Charles ClymerBlogger, student and Army veteranIf a stranger approached you with a gun, late at night, how would you react? As a white person, I am permitted to attack and defend myself. People of color, within seconds, must consider how this will look to a jury. Think that\u0027s off-base?Comments (416)Arianna HuffingtonRobert Greenwald\u0027s Brave New Foundation\u0027s recent video on the U.S. \"signature\" drone attacks gives us a glimpse, even if the White House won\u0027t, of what\u0027s being done in our name.Comments (1,113)Jeffrey SachsDirector, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \"To Move the World: JFK\u0027s Quest for Peace\"American politicians and pundits know almost nothing about Egypt but were quick to endorse the military coup against Morsi. The reason is Islamophobia: the biased U.S. presumption that Morsi\u0027s fall is simply the result of Islamist authoritarianism. The truth is a little more complicated.Comments (292)Charles HowardUniversity Chaplain, University of PennsylvaniaSo now that we see that there is neither justice nor peace, what is next? We must work for both: To fix a broken justice system and a to fix the broken peace within our hearts and within our communities.Comments (336)Ryan GoslingActorI take my beloved dog George with me almost everywhere I go. Once, George even shared the stage with me on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.Comments (257)Sarah BrownFounder, A World at SchoolEducation is relatively inexpensive in the developing world, and fosters citizens who can contribute to their local economy, raise healthy families and ensure a safer, less militant society.Comments (41)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorI sent D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray five questions to consider in deciding whether he would support or veto the living wage bill passed by the city council. These questions should be answered by any community considering the value of a Walmart store.Comments (773)Rahfin FarukUndergraduate, Southern Methodist UniversityFor the last month, the George Zimmerman trial controlled the airwaves. From MSNBC to 20/20, every news program has provided disproportionate coverage to a case that has sparked important discussions about American race relations, identity and politics.Comments (54)Larry StraussVeteran high school teacher and coach, writerWhatever the verdict and however any of us feel about it, this incident is a symptom of a sickness of which we are all a part.Comments (1,350)BLACKYo-yo performance artistI had reached the highest title in the yo-yo world -- but yo-yo is not in the Olympics, and it is not a major sport. Even the title of world champion had no value in society. I was crushed. I lived many spiritless days for many years.Comments (175)Patricia SundFlight attendant and freelance writerThere\u0027s a lot more to being a flight attendant than slinging orange juice. You just don\u0027t see it. If you saw what was covered in my manual, you\u0027d freak. And there\u0027s only so much training you can get before you run into something that has never happened before.Comments (161)Ban Ki-moonSecretary-General, United NationsMalala Yousafzai may be one of the best-known students in the world, but she is also a teacher. This month she will mark her 16th birthday by coming to the United Nations and sharing an important lesson about education -- particularly for girls around the world.Comments (53)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarThe past few years especially have seen a tremendous uprising of parenting experts, including baby nurses, parenting coaches, and, of course, mommy bloggers. Everyone has a different opinion, and there are endless outlets through which to voice that opinion.Comments (34)Gordon BrownFormer Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationMalala Yousafzai, the girl the Taliban shot for going to school and who has become the world\u0027s symbol for the right of every girl to have an education, will speak at the United Nations on her sixteenth birthday today.Comments (23)Sec. Kathleen SebeliusSecretary of Health and Human ServicesFar too many children -- especially those known to the child welfare system -- have experienced trauma. Despite the amazing work of the professionals who care for these vulnerable children, we know there\u0027s more we can do. Today, I\u0027m pleased to announce a critical step forward.CommentsMaurice TracySaint Louis University American studies doctoral candidate; Chicago, ILGeorge Zimmerman, you are free, you are a killer but you are free; so many of us are not, and are still waiting be seen as human, let alone equal.Comments (68)Harvey WeinsteinFilm ProducerIf we run ads with The Butler, the MPAA is imposing $25,000 a day in penalties. We have to pull 5,000 trailers from the theaters, we have to pull our website down, all of which we complied with. What the hell do they need the title for?Comments (119)Tara SkurtuPoet and Teaching Fellow, Boston UniversityThis poem wants to stand its ground, silence force with simple words, pray you alive, anyone\u0027s son -- tall boy, eye-smile, walk on home.Comments (35)Janet ColmPresident \u0026 CEO, Planned Parenthood of Central North Carolina and Planned Parenthood Action Fund of Central North CarolinaAll these issues are connected -- education, health care, prenatal care, unemployment benefits, support for domestic violence services, early education, voting rights -- and access to birth control, accurate sex education, and abortion. This is how we make our state better.Comments (44)Sen. Dianne FeinsteinU.S. Senator from CaliforniaWhy does the cultivation of poppy -- the plant used to produce heroin -- in a faraway land matter? Simply put, the illicit drug trade in Afghanistan finances terrorist activities of the Taliban.Comments (303)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027God is far bigger than a single political party. What we cannot accept, nor allow, is for our own leaders to willfully exacerbate our problems and directly harm people who are already suffering -- to sacrifice the common good to their own ideological agendas.Comments (246)Stephanie R. CaudleManaging Editor, She\u0027s My SuperwomanThere are numerous things I never thought I would have to tell people not to do but in many cases common sense is not so common. Here are a few tips you should consider NOT doing when attending your next wedding.Comments (358)Jamie CullumAward-winning UK jazz artistRaymond Blanc is a whirlwind of a man. A wind tunnel of ideas, wisecracks and long, hilarious, partially understandable jokes. He\u0027s like the naughty boy at school that is cleverer than all the teachers.CommentsRichard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureBankers break the law with impunity, are bailed out, and go on breaking the law, richer than they were before. And yet, bizarrely, the only Americans who seem to be seething with anger are the beneficiaries of this economic injustice -- the wealthiest and most privileged among us.Comments (2,120)Paloma GoñiJournalistWomen have hair on their legs. We have hair on our armpits. And on our pubis. And in a thousand other places. We\u0027re hairy, the same as men. And that\u0027s real. A reality that women, pressured by one another, insist on hiding.Comments (648)Benjamin Todd JealousPresident and CEO, NAACPClimate change is more than an environmental issue. It is important to remember who is most affected by climate change, and specifically by coal pollution: low-income communities and communities of color.Comments (30)Lauren LyonsRecent graduate, Harvard Kennedy School of Government; founder of BetaDater.comDespite NASA\u0027s award-winning social media and web outreach efforts, there are still massive gaps between the public\u0027s perception of the agency, and the reality. And unless you are a big space geek like me with daily space Google alerts, it\u0027s not unreasonable to be a bit confused.Comments (167)Binta Niambi Brown, 2013.14.07Ray Chambers, 2013.14.07Gabrielle Dunkley, 2013.14.07Jeremy Harris Lipschultz, 2013.14.07Stephanie Mott, 2013.14.07Stu Kreisman, 2013.14.07Alfred W.
