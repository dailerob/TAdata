{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week the mystery over Malaysia Airlines flight 370 deepened, as officials said the 777\u0027s tracking mechanisms may have been deliberately turned off, and that the plane might have flown for hours afterwards. One thing we already know for sure -- but seem to forget every time -- is that in these kinds of situations the first breathless rounds of \"Breaking News!\" speculation are almost always wrong. Suspense also continued to build in Crimea as Russian forces moved into a village outside the Crimean border ahead of today\u0027s referendum, already regarded as illegitimate by Western governments. Meanwhile, the White House is considering delaying the confirmation vote on Dr. Vivek Murthy as Surgeon General because lawmakers -- including many Democrats -- are upset that he spoke out in favor of gun control. Why it would be considered controversial to have a chief public health official who wants to do something about the source of 30,000 deaths each year is a uniquely American mystery.Comments (42)Dr Mark WilliamsonDirector of Action for HappinessEverywhere we look the story is the same: buy and achieve these things and then you\u0027ll be happy. But remember, you\u0027ll then need to keep getting more in order to stay happy and keep up with your peers. And if they start to get ahead then just keep consuming! On and on we go in a mindless and seemingly endless cycle.CommentsDavid BromwichProfessor of Literature, Yale UniversityObama entered the presidency at 47 -- an age at which people as a rule are pretty much what they are going to be. It is a piece of mystification to suppose that we have been denied a rescue that this man, under happier circumstances, would have been well equipped to perform.Comments (338)Diane RavitchResearch Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027There is no evidence from any other nation that replacing a public system with a privatized choice system produces anything but social, economic, and racial segregation.Comments (441)Arianna HuffingtonWhy have we made exercising -- at least the way we do it in the places that have come to be known as \"health clubs\" -- such an awful experience? If we\u0027re going to redefine success to include well-being, we also need to redefine getting in shape to include mental and soul fitness.Comments (38)Rashard MendenhallNFL Running Back, Arizona CardinalsI\u0027ve greatly enjoyed my time, but I no longer wish to put my body at risk for the sake of entertainment. I think about the rest of my life and I want to live it with much quality. And physically, I am grateful that I can walk away feeling as good as I did when I stepped into it.Comments (319)Robin LakoffProfessor of linguistics emerita, University of California, BerkeleyWe need to understand why a word like \u0027bossy\u0027 exists with its current meaning, and change the world that makes it meaningful and useful.Comments (74)Jeffrey SachsDirector, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \"To Move the World: JFK\u0027s Quest for Peace\"There is no doubt that Russian militarized bullying can lead to the de facto division of Ukraine, an event that would be of grave long-term consequences not only for Russia and Ukraine but for the world. The practical question is whether international law can still function to stop this from occurring. In my view, the answer is yes.Comments (33)Tim StobierskiAspiring author and editorStudents around the country have families who have been evicted from homes; parents who have used their retirement accounts to pay the mortgage until it ran dry; rent and student loan payments that leave them with less than 50 dollars a month with which to buy food.Comments (97)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe sad truth is you can work full time in America and not be able to meet your family\u0027s basic needs. A parent working full time at the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour earns $15,080 a year before taxes. That\u0027s $4,700 below the poverty level for a parent with two children.Comments (159)Noah MichelsonExecutive Editor, HuffPost Gay VoicesIn honor of my dad, Robert Michelson, one of the most incredible men who ever spent a little time on this planet -- and in honor of the pain and grief and wonder conjured by death -- I am sharing five things that I learned while helping him die.Comments (178)Peter H. SchuckLaw Professor, Yale; Author, \u0027Why Government Fails So Often, and How It Can Do Better\u0027There are many functions that only the government can perform and many others that Congress has decided that it should perform. In the case of the ACA, as with many other programs, its relationship with the relevant markets is ambivalent, uneasy, and uncertain.Comments (12)Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoThis week marks the 50th anniversary of the Supreme Court\u0027s decision in New York Times v. Sullivan, perhaps the most important First Amendment case in American history. In the words of the great First Amendment scholar Alexander Meiklejohn, the decision was \"an occasion for dancing in the streets.\" Why was Sullivan so important?Comments (19)Elizabeth RiderHealth coach, blogger, wellness expert, speakerI\u0027ve redefined my own success to mean being relevant to people who need my help, giving more than I take, and living life on my own terms. The letters behind my name and my rank within a company just don\u0027t matter.Comments (21)Al GoreChairman, Generation Investment Management and The Climate Reality ProjectIt is extremely disturbing that the government of Malaysia -- by continuing to press this case beyond the bounds of reason, let alone the bounds of justice -- has used the courts to short-circuit the political process.CommentsTEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"If thinking of cerebral palsy makes you think of someone sad or helpless, then watch this talk and let comedian Maysoon Zayid blow your mind. She\u0027s fierce, she\u0027s funny, and she refuses to let you feel sorry for her.Comments (83)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorWall Street gamblers are still paid huge money and are again creeping toward reckless misbehavior. Their corporate crime wave strip-mined the economy for young workers and is draining away their ability to afford basic goods.Comments (65)Naomi CampbellModel, Actor, Activist, Mentor and Executive Producer of The FaceWhen going nude in any setting I think most of us initially worry about being judged and feeling vulnerable in that there is no place to hide our insecurities - they are totally exposed for everyone to see.CommentsJim WallisChristian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersToday the world celebrates Pope Francis\u0027 first year. Notice I didn\u0027t say the church is celebrating, but the world. His popularity has moved beyond Catholics to Christians of all kinds, believers from other faith traditions, agnostics, and the \"nones,\" who are very drawn to this pope who emphasizes love and simple living.Comments (26)K. Ford K.Author, \u0027The Wife of John the Baptist\u0027 and \u0027The Concubine\u0027s Gift\u0027I began to feel I had slipped so low that I was no longer respected. I lost self confidence. I stopped talking about my writing. Soon nobody knew that I was a writer or that I\u0027d ever gone to college. Nobody knew me. I became invisible.Comments (166)Michael SmerconishSiriusXM Radio HostMarine Lance Cpl. Matthew A. Snyder was just 20 years old when he died in a one-vehicle Humvee accident in Iraq on March 3, 2006, just five weeks after his deployment. A half-dozen Westboro members picketed Matthew Snyder\u0027s funeral at a Roman Catholic Church in Maryland one week later.Comments (71)Amanda DubermanNews Editor, HuffPost WomenThat researchers and health advocates need to presume harsh judgement of sexually active women to convince skeptics of birth control\u0027s utility just reminds us how far we have to go.Comments (281)Scott FettersCopywriter and Facebook marketing consultantI\u0027m obsessed with tracking. I have numerous tools for tracking metrics, hours, and even an activity tracker for my personal life. Oddly enough, I never tracked my daily work routine from waking up to dozing off -- until now. Suitably dubbed, The 6 a.m. Experiment.Comments (24)Ellie KrupnickSenior Editor of Viral Content and Strategy, The Huffington PostSuddenly, like revelation at Sinai, Shabbat started to make perfect sense. Those 25 hours became a respite from my mounting schoolwork, a forced hiatus from the endless black hole of the Internet, the only time I could turn off a screen long enough to, say, play a game with my family.CommentsRobert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027It\u0027s often assumed that people are paid what they\u0027re worth. According to this logic, minimum wage workers aren\u0027t worth more than the $7.25 an hour they now receive. If they were worth more, they\u0027d earn more. Any attempt to force employers to pay them more will only kill jobs.Comments (906)Claire FallonBooks Editor, The Huffington PostUsing \"huh\" as a replacement for a real inquiry drives me absolutely nuts. It smacks of a willful detachment from the conversation, a way of saying \"I heard you and am reacting, but I don\u0027t care enough to bother thinking of a meaningful response.\"Comments (114)Pierce BrosnanActorMust whales and dolphins be subjected to deafening noise that will cause more than 3.5 million instances of temporary and/or permanent hearing loss?Comments (16)Patrick SmithAirline pilot, air travel columnist and authorIt\u0027s fascinating how this story has moved from being one about a presumed airplane crash to, really, a mystery story. It\u0027s the very missing-ness of the plane that the public finds so captivating.CommentsKrista BarthAttorneyWhy do people marry people they know are unkind, unfaithful, selfish, or without common values or interests?Comments (32)Joseph A. PalermoProfessor, historian, authorThe Senate must prevail in this Constitutional showdown between a secretive Executive Branch relic of the Cold War that has a long history of doing nasty things in our name.Comments (124)Alissa ParkerBlogger, TheParkerFive and co-founder, safeandsoundschools.orgTriggers are hard. They are often unpredictable and they are strong. I have learned to not fight these emotions, but to let them run through me.CommentsThomas de Zengotita, 2014.16.03Jonathan Weiler, 2014.16.03Jared Bernstein, 2014.16.03Nicholas Tampio, 2014.16.03HuffPost Radio, 2014.16.03Lewis Lapham, 2014.16.03Jason Sattler, 2014.16.03Marta Ibarrondo, 2014.16.03Rev.
