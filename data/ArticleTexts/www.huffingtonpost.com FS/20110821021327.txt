{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Children\u0027s Defense FundAs our nation pauses to honor Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on the anniversary of the historic 1963 March on Washington, most will focus on only part of the story. When many Americans think of the historic March, they think of Dr. King standing on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial delivering his inspiring \"I Have a Dream,\" words he spontaneously added at the very end of his speech. For nearly 50 years the powerful words in that section have been quoted all over the world. But too few people remember that the March on Washington wasn\u0027t focused just on racial equality but was actually named the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and was a demand for economic opportunity and economic justice for all.Read Post | CommentsHoward Fineman, 8/19/11Editorial Director, AOL Huffington Post Media GroupKarl Rove won\u0027t say it aloud, but he is afraid of Rick Perry: afraid that the smack-talking Texas governor will wreck the GOP\u0027s chances of winning the White House and the Senate in 2012.Read Post | CommentsJames Zogby, 8/20/11President, the Arab American Institute; Author, \"Arab Voices\"The Arab League should make it clear that the Assad regime has lost whatever legitimacy it once claimed in the Arab World and promptly suspend its membership in the organization, declaring that the regime has forfeited the right to play a role in Syria\u0027s and the region\u0027s futureRead Post | CommentsJoanna Dolgoff, M.D., 8/20/11Pediatrician, Child Obesity Specialist, and Author of Red Light, Green Light, Eat Right!It\u0027s important in college -- especially with so much to do -- to be aware of the proper nutrition your body needs to help you perform at your peak, both in the classroom and in the rest of your daily life.Read Post | CommentsLouis Peitzman, 8/20/11Freelance arts writerLook, I don\u0027t think Kim Kardashian needs any help from me, but her role as walking punchline is absurd.

It is the solemn and fundamental obligation of ALL religious institutions and leaders to fight relentlessly for understanding and reconciliation.Read Post | CommentsRicky Gervais, 8/19/11Actor, writer, comedian, director, producer\"Life\u0027s Too Short\" is a fake documentary about a showbiz dwarf. But it\u0027s not a sitcom about being short at all. It\u0027s about a man with a small man complex. He is angry, arrogant, manipulative, selfish, and above all, fame hungry.Read Post | CommentsMJ Rosenberg, 8/20/11Senior Foreign Policy Fellow, Media Matters Action NetworkThe Palestinian decision to turn to the UN is not a threat to Israel, it is an opportunity. And Israel cannot afford to miss any more opportunities.Read Post | CommentsDanielle Tumminio, 8/20/11Author, \u0027God and Harry Potter at Yale\u0027I have become even more firmly convinced that sometimes laughter is the greatest blessing we have in stressful times. Perhaps God wants us to laugh in those moments when pain seems to be the only thing we feel.Read Post | CommentsAl Norman, 8/20/11Founder, Sprawl-BustersAs Wal-Mart\u0027s U.S. operation loses momentum, and lack-luster same store sales performance from its overbuilt domestic inventory continues to disappoint, shareholders will suffer from Wal-Mart fatigue, and look for more nimble, faster-growing competitors.Read Post | CommentsJames Peron, 8/20/11President, Moorfield Storey InstituteWhen Hollywood rallies to the defense of innocent people, and secures justice for them, this is contemporary liberalism at its best.Read Post | CommentsDaniel Cubias and Louis Pagan, 8/20/11Could a personal-feedback loop help recent immigrants learn English more quickly? Might the idea be applied to concepts like voter registration or proper prenatal care, both of which are issues within the Latino population?Read Post | CommentsJowita Bydlowska, 8/20/11WriterMommy has a frilly tank top that shows off her chest, so why shouldn\u0027t her daughter have one produced by a company named Jours Après Lunes (or should it be \"the morning after\"?). The little girl will put on a string bikini not understanding at all what the string is meant to suggest, not understanding that it\u0027s a signifier.Read Post | CommentsReza Aslan, 8/19/11Founder, AslanMedia.com; Author, \u0027Beyond Fundamentalism\u0027The stage is set for a showdown this weekend between two prevailing forces in Israeli society: one which advocates national security above all else, and one which believes a country that prides itself on being a prosperous democracy must meet its obligations to its weakest citizens.Read Post | CommentsJason Linkins and Zach Carter, 8/18/11It\u0027s been a while since we\u0027ve heard that trumpet voluntary from the Treasury Department, signaling the sending of another press release celebrating the fact that \"TARP worked!\" But this week, the horns sounded.Read Post | CommentsJeff Wald, 8/19/11CEO, ARIA Multimedia EntertainmentConservative and Liberal are labels we are given to divide us.

I am going to attempt a tribute of sorts, as I can think of few people in the entertainment field more deserving.Read Post | CommentsSteve Mariotti, 8/20/11Educator specializing in at-risk youthLike the standard business cycle, drug money creates booms, busts, and misallocations of investments and resources. One of the most insidious aspects of the drug industry is that its excess profits are invested in human capital.Read Post | CommentsRob Johnson, 8/19/11Director of Economic Policy, Roosevelt Institute, NewDeal2.0The ongoing talk of more quantitative easing is mainly a symptom of desperation and reflects the dysfunction in Congress and the White House that has stopped us from using much more effective tools to spur the economy forward.Read Post | CommentsLaura Stampler, 8/19/11A chubby young girl with Pippi Longstocking braids stands in front of the mirror holding up a too-small pink dress and sees a different version of herself.
