{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Director, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \"To Move the World: JFK\u0027s Quest for Peace\"We should understand from the start that the US had a major hand in creating the new ISIS monster. The US funded the Mujahedeen in Afghanistan in the 1980s, which then morphed into al-Qaeda. Then the US destabilized Iraq from 1990 onward and Syria from the mid-2000s, in effect giving al-Qaeda and its affiliates a new stronghold. (As Assad moved closer to Iran, the US and Saudi Arabia took up the effort to topple him.) ISIS broke away from al-Qaeda, and then captured the weaponry that the US had supplied to the Iraqi army. Now, President Obama is getting us still deeper into this never-ending battle with monsters stoked by our own ill-advised policies. Why is he leading us further down this failed path? The US fights these failed wars mainly because of domestic politics.Can you believe in women\u0027s rights and enjoy football? Can you be angry about Ray Rice and the NFL\u0027s inadequate handling of him but still feel okay about watching the game? The answer, to both, is no.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarIn May 1977, President Jimmy Carter gave a speech at Notre Dame rejecting what he termed the \"inordinate fear of communism.\" As President Obama prepares to address the nation this evening, Americans with some grey in their hair have seen this movie before.Senior Fellow, Brookings InstitutionISIS is making headlines all over the world, but not always for the same reasons. Are U.S. and international media covering ISIS the way they should be? An international group largely made up of Muslim reporters tells me what they think of ISIS, the American media and the Muslim world.National Religion Reporter, The Huffington PostWhile this dynamic is understood by those working in the beltway, people outside of Washington remain largely unaware of the relationship between civil rights organizations and the interests of telecom industry players.Co-founder ColorOfChange.org and Citizen Engagement Lab\"But there\u0027s really nothing new about this tragedy,\" Dr. Murray told me. \"Nothing new at all. It\u0027s like all these guys read the same abuser handbook. They\u0027re not unique. They\u0027re just abusers, and they all do the same thing.\"Award-winning actress, author and activistCapitalists used to spend their time battling unionized labor for the spoils of their joint economic pie -- and generally capitalists were successful. Now their battle is with the high-end talent upon whom capital is entirely dependent to make the decisions that will make the company they own profitable or not.Author, \u0027Fixing the Game\u0027Do you know someone who died by his or her hands, or tried (including perhaps you)? If you do, whether near or far from your heart, we hope you will join New York State and The Huffington Post in our campaign to help prevent deaths that need not happen.Medical director, New York State Office of Mental HealthIn the state I was in, I don\u0027t even know if it was day or night, but I was told later that the police came to find me after being alerted by a close friend who had seen the Facebook post on my timeline. When they arrived, I had a bottle of Jack Daniels in one hand and a knife in the other.Professional boxerThings will not get fixed overnight in Chicago. But it is heartening to see the impact that athletes can have working with community leaders. It is even more moving to see young men and women take a stand against the violence in their communities and work toward a better future.NBA Hall of FamerThe Zionist colonization of Palestine has proceeded primarily on the principle of the quiet establishment of facts on the ground, which the world was to ultimately come to accept. It has been highly successful. There is every reason to expect it to persist as long as the US provides the necessary military, economic, diplomatic, and ideological support.Institute Professor emeritus, MIT Department of Linguistics and PhilosophyIt\u0027s possible that, underneath it all, though, we stay because our brains are wired wrong. I know I was addicted to the oxytocin produced by having a man in my life -- no matter how awful a man.Film and TV writer and producer; author, \u0027Love Addict: Sex, Romance and Other Dangerous Drugs\u0027As two gay men adopting a child -- as \"different\" parents raising a \"different\" family -- this was, in fact, what we\u0027d signed up for. Yet no amount of preparation or groundwork or open-mindedness kept me from being surprised by these not-really-out-of-the-blue questions.Writer, graphic designer, illustrator and dadWhat the NRA is trying to do is cast itself in a softer, more reasonable and, if you\u0027ll pardon the expression, less combative way, because for the first time they are up against an opponent whose money, smarts and media access can sway lots of people to go the opposite way.Mike the Gun GuyAs I watch the woman seizing in front of me though, I do not feel helplessness, but shame. In many ways, learning how to care for patients with Ebola means unlearning some of my most basic clinical instincts.Assistant Professor of Emergency Medicine, Brown Medical SchoolTomorrow night on PBS I\u0027m joined by Ed Harris, four-time Oscar nominee and Golden Globe winner, to talk about his new film, Frontera, co-starring Eva Longoria and Micheal Peña.PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorAt the core of all of this is an ignominious reality at odds with one of the nation\u0027s most (publicly) cherished ideals, and one of our Constitution\u0027s most sacred laws: the Fourteenth Amendment right to \"equal protection of the laws.\"President, Emerging Millennials Leadership AllianceThe temple was huge and packed and silent and all her fancy friends were there, as well as many of us girl comics, because we had lost our dear leader (I do see her as my own personal Kim Jong Ill, as she was tiny yet commanded an empire) and so it was our saddest day.Comedian, actor and recording artistFor many of our brave servicemen and women, transitioning home is challenging. Imagine the strain of leaving family and friends for months on end in an unfamiliar country, enduring battle and seeing your friends fall to the enemy. Then, you come home to banners, beers and thank yous -- but the nation is focused largely on other issues. You\u0027ve lost a sense of serving a greater mission, and working alongside men and women you would trust your life with.Founder, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of AmericaThe Republicans have their billionaires, the Democrats have theirs. What\u0027s the big kerfuffle about campaign spending, right? Wrong.President, Public CitizenIf you don\u0027t understand how Ray Rice was allowed to initially escape prosecution, accepting a much lesser punishment of therapy from the court, nothing illustrates the culture of protecting the abusers of women better than Republican Ben Carson\u0027s statement on behalf of Ray Rice.Author, political writer, relationship expert.If Westboro does show up in front of our offices to protest, we\u0027ll be ready for them. We\u0027re not scared of a handful of sad people with access to school supplies and a few nasty slogans.Executive Editor, HuffPost Gay VoicesAs President Obama gives a national address this evening on how he intends to destroy ISIS without putting American \"boots on the ground,\" a potent force of 2,500 combat Marines, backed by attack helicopters and jet strike fighters, is aboard warships trolling off the U.S. east coast.Senior Military Correspondent, The Huffington PostThis summer, 12 major corporations publicly identified policy roadblocks and called for new opportunities for collaboration with utilities and energy suppliers to increase their ability to buy clean, renewable energy.Head of Climate Change Program, World Wildlife FundAmid the degeneration and loss of freedom and wellbeing of millions, an ember of civility and civilization in the form of a video entitled \"The Greek Secret\" has emerged. It is sweeping around the world.President and Founder, The Washington Oxi Day FoundationFrom the airport to the board room, I want to make sure I look my best and, most importantly, well-rested! Here are a few of my favorite go-to products for travel to ensure you look fabulous from take-off to touchdown.Makeup artistt is not acceptable that we have to be shown something that we knew occurred in order to be moved.

It\u0027s also one of the most easily avoided, and most difficult to fix: the ever-present Twitter Blunder.Torontonian, Traveler, ActivistA new poll confirms that voters don\u0027t just want their Social Security benefits protected, they want them expanded -- in overwhelming numbers, across geographical distances, and crossing all party lines. It\u0027s not just \"liberals\" who feel that way. Three out of four Republican voters support it.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourDepression impacts all of us, even the funny ones. Including me. After chemo I didn\u0027t know what to do. I wasn\u0027t suicidal, but I also wasn\u0027t alive. After a couple near breakdowns (which often involved store security officers, I\u0027m embarrassed to admit), I sought help.Writer, Comedian, ManRegardless of whether one agrees or disagrees with the views of the super-rich, this state of affairs is an unmitigated disaster for American democracy.Edward H.
