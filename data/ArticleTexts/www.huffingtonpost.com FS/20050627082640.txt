{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AriannaYesterday’s Meet the Press with Donald Rumsfeld might as well have been called Meet the Press Conference because it’s unclear what more we got out of Rummy than we would have gotten if he had just given one of his preening, cutesy press conferences. Every single one of Rumsfeld’s answers was, in fact, designed to confuse, obscure and obfuscate. That’s his shtick. And E-ZPass Russert’s is to let him slide right on by. He even let Rumsfeld get away with saying: “The terrorists have no vision, they have no Ho Chi Minh, they have no Mao, they don\u0027t have any cause… That isn\u0027t any long-term formula for success”. Shouldn’t Russert have asked him when Ho Chi Minh became our standard of leadership? And shouldn’t he have asked him whether the terrorists, in fact, have more of a long-term formula for success than we do?Later, when Russert brought up new reports about meetings between U.S. officials and members of the insurgency, Rumsfeld insisted that the administration is not reaching out to insurgents “with blood on their hands”. And Russert never asked him who these non-violent insurgents are. Did we miss the news about the creation of a non-violent political wing of the insurgency?READ MORE06.27.2005 Harry ShearerSunday morning, Donald Rumsfeld made the rounds of the TV yakfests, talking up the war. One of Rumsfeld\u0027s stops was on Meet the Press where, just before going on the air, the old master administered a bit of crucial spin to the host and moderator (and NBC Washington bureau chief.

Sure there are some promising things happening, but they are not being embraced nearly fast enough. All the wisdom of the Supreme Court will not change that bottom line.read whole post | permalink06.25.2005 Bob DreyfussI paid pretty close attention to the just-concluded visit to Washington by Iraqi Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari. Sadly, the media gave Jaafari a free pass, asking him mostly softball questions and ignoring his radical-Islamist past, including his terrorist connections. Nothing at all came up about Jaafari\u0027s background as a leader of the Islamic Call (Al Dawa) party.read whole post | permalink | comments06.25.2005 Paul FeigWith Italy calling for the arrest of 13 of our CIA agents, it has become clear that we must demonstrate our displeasure with their actions by extending our formerly popular and successful “Freedom Fries” campaign. Hence, Italian sausage shall now be referred to as “Independence Sausage.” The following list has been compiled in order to minimize the time it will take members of the administration and congress to illustrate their displeasure with other non-cooperative nations...read whole post | permalink | comments06.25.2005 Hooman MajdA question for George Bush: where were the Iranians you stand with, those who stand for freedom and democracy, on Friday? They must not have been at polls, for arch-conservative Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was elected the next president of the Islamic Republic in a landslide. Despite some questions of fraud and voter intimidation, Ahmadinejad won with enough of a margin to put to rest the idea that Iranians are ready for regime-change.read whole post | permalink | comments06.26.2005 Bill DiamondArianna’s Huffington Post scoop has me wondering -- is it that far-fetched to speculate that Dick Cheney’s long history of knee problems will soon result in his resignation, leading the President to tap Condoleezza Rice for the V.P. position before his term is over?read whole post | permalink | comments06.25.2005 Nellie BMay I interrupt the Rovian food fight long enough to mention a threat to America that could dwarf 9/11? Flying under the headlines, avian flu A (H5N1) has killed only 54 people so far (and an awful lot of birds) in Asia, but the World Health Organization and assorted scientists are worried that the virus could lead to a pandemic that would kill at least 500,000 in the United States, many more world-wide.read whole post | permalink | comments06.26.2005 Paul KrassnerWhen Scientology learned that (a) The Realist had no assets, and (b) I was in the habit of publishing satirical articles, they offered to settle their $750,000 lawsuit for $5,000. I turned it down. Then they offered to drop the suit altogether if I would publish an article by Chick Corea, a jazz pianist and member of Scientology. I explained that this was not how I made my editorial decisions, and again I refused to settle. They dropped the suit anyway.read whole post | permalink | comments06.25.2005 Dan CarolReady to wonk out a bit? Let\u0027s talk about the energy bill debate coming up in Washington. Hmm, never mind, maybe it\u0027s a good time to head to the islands and avoid hearing politicians of every stripe crow about their commitment to energy independence -- and then watch Congress and Bush fail to deliver the bold, clean energy moon shot we really-really need.read whole post | permalink | comments06.26.2005 Richard ValerianiPresident Bush tells a news conference he thinks about Iraq every day. Could have fooled us. In Iran, the hard-liner defeated the moderate in the race for President. The difference?

The annual appropriation from Congress, the appointment of CPB board members by the President, increased dependence on corporate underwriters and other structures ensure that the public broadcasting will remain the victim of – rather than be insulated from – political and commercial pressures.read whole post | permalink | comments06.25.2005 Tom HaydenNewt Gingrich narrated a Fox Special this weekend suggesting that Salvadoran gangs might smuggle Al Qaeda terrorism into the United States. Fusing the war on terrorism with the war on drugs and the war on gangs makes good politics, but is as flawed as the claim that Iraq was collaborating with Osama Bin Ladin.read whole post | permalink | comments06.27.2005 Jodie EvansStill absent is any sign of the US media, except the cameras of Deep Dish TV.
