{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Stephen SchlesingerAuthor and Fellow at the Century FoundationUN Secretary Ban Ki Moon\u0027s trip to Moscow to meet with President Putin yesterday was, at best, an exercise in pro forma UN diplomacy. It seems mostly designed to show to UN member-states that Secretary-General was acting expeditiously to resolve the Crimean crisis but without really advancing any innovative or practical solutions to the dispute. Listen to Mr. Ban\u0027s words to Russian President Vladimir Putin, as reported in the press: let\u0027s protect the Russian minority in the Ukraine; let\u0027s make sure that \"a small incident\" does not spiral out of control; let\u0027s begin a dialogue between Kiev and Moscow. Now no person will disagree with Ban\u0027s sentiments. But given the dire confrontational situation now looming between Europe and the US versus Russia, one might have expected Ban to come forward at this stage in the stand-off.Comments (21)TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"Why is it more prestigious to be a CEO than it is to take care of your family? Why aren\u0027t caregivers and breadwinners equally celebrated? And do women actually have more choices than men? Watch this provocative talk from public policy expert, wife and mother Anne-Marie Slaughter.Comments (116)Mark Ruffalo and Cyrus BuffumFor too long, we have paid little attention to our planet\u0027s most crucial natural resource: water.CommentsDr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarThe more companies tell consumers they love us; the more they show us that they don\u0027t. Some say that modern retail is really a \"war to con consumers.\"Comments (11)Jürgen TrittinFormer Federal Minister for the Environment, GermanyGermany\u0027s energy transformation is an example of a win for both independence and sovereignty. The rapid expansion of renewable energy saves us not just about 150 million tons of greenhouse gases each year. It also reduces the need for annual imports worth about 10 billion euros.CommentsJosh Kilmer-PurcellAuthor, \u0027I Am Not Myself These Days\u0027I\u0027m sending a casserole to Fred Phelps\u0027 daughter, Shirley Phelps-Roper -- a person I\u0027m proud, and somewhat befuddled, to call an old friend.Comments (134)Chi ShermanWriter, blogger, spoken word artistI got laid off from a full-time job due to the belly-up economy. I didn\u0027t realize just how much of my identity I had associated with \"being important\" -- dressing up, interacting with clients, being seen as a professional. Now I was aimless, wearing jeans and flip flops, and worrying about money in a way I never had before.Comments (64)Scott HarrisonFounder and president, charity: waterIt was still dark and cool when 13-year-old Letikiros walked out the door to get water. She never came home. At 4 p.m. a man found her lifeless body swinging from a tree, a rope tied around her neck.CommentsAzie DungeyWriter and star of the two-season hit web series, \u0027Ask A Slave\u0027Reimagining Peter Pan and the character of Tiger Lily presents an opportunity to reform a role that was written in a marginalizing, demeaning way. If we are going to retell these stories, it is our job to do this hard work.Comments (45)James ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027President Obama\u0027s upcoming meeting with Saudi Arabia\u0027s King Abdullah comes at a time when transformative developments are convulsing the regional and world order and relations between the US and the Kingdom have become strained.CommentsMarian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundJo Ann Robinson and other unsung heroines of the civil rights movement remain role models for the tireless indispensable behind-the-scenes leaders whose strength and determination we desperately need right now.CommentsRaluca StateLife is short. And I want to spend the rest of it loving myself and taking pride in the woman I have become and the choices I make.CommentsChris WeigantPolitical writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comRepublicans all patted themselves on the back this week for fixing their party\u0027s problems. No, really! It\u0027s been one year since their \"autopsy\" or \"post-mortem\" of the 2012 elections and the party\u0027s completely \"fixed.\"Comments (19)Adam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911Most people assume identity thieves are super-sophisticated hackers sitting in front of banks of blinking computer screens. But sometimes you really never see it coming, and the identity thief who ruined your credit and turned your life upside down is actually your mom or dad.CommentsBrad StulbergPopulation Health ConsultantIt\u0027s time to start thinking about innovation in health care not just as some new fancy machine or surgical technique, but also as how we identify, approach and work with vulnerable people so there is less need to treat them as acute patients.Comments (13)Adam GrantWharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027Evidence shows that we think we\u0027re superior to others in every domain: We believe we\u0027re smarter, more attractive, more likable, and more skilled at a wide range of tasks, from math to leadership. For a long time, I hoped these narcissistic tendencies wouldn\u0027t extend to the domain of giving and helping. I was wrong.Comments (16)Tom MorrisOne of America\u0027s most active public philosophersWe live at a time that has many of its values positioned upside down. The least important things, we think and talk about the most, while, the most important things, we think and talk about the least. Current values force dedicated teachers, nurses, and blue-collar workers to live in obscure poverty, while young media entrepreneurs and entertainers compete for vast fame and fortune.Comments (11)Sarah KleinSenior Editor, Health \u0026 FitnessAt this age group, the goal is without a doubt more activity. But because it\u0027s also essentially a HIIT workout, which we know burns calories and fat while improving fitness levels, even adults could benefit from a little CrossFit for kids.CommentsTheo BarkWriter, Producer/Host HuffPost Live MusicTo a large extent, this year\u0027s SXSW Music Conference felt like an extension of the Interactive portion that preceded it; a brand-sponsored networking event with musical entertainment. It\u0027s not about the fans and press anymore, it\u0027s just not.CommentsRachel Lincoln SarnoffBlogger, Mommy GreenestI believe that we can still support environmental health while remaining pro-vaccine. Isn\u0027t the green movement about questioning preconceptions, seeking out good science, and making better decisions?Comments (19)The Daily MealTheDailyMeal.comThink back to the last time you ate at a fancy restaurant and try to remember the exact dialogue you had with your server. During that seemingly innocuous meal, odds are that several different attempts were made to get you to spend more money.CommentsJim WallisChristian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersFox voiceovers loom: \"Food stamp abusers, eating on taxpayers.\" Then another, \"America\u0027s poor are actually living the good life\" -- quite a despicable comment revealing the perspective of those who have never lived with, worked with, or even been around poor people in America.Comments (64)Keith ProctorSenior Policy Researcher, Mercy CorpsLike many Syrian refugees fleeing the civil war in their country, Sabeen has found another crisis in Jordan: water scarcity.CommentsSharon GreenthalBlogger, Empty House Full Mind, Founder, Midlifeboulevard.comMy high school years were a pot smoke-filled haze of bad decisions. For a variety of reasons, including a cross-country move at the age of 14 and the break-up of my parents\u0027 marriage, I was not a happy girl during my high school years.CommentsKelly MacLeanStand up comic, actress, writer @thekellymacleanThere are several Geniuses here today, it\u0027s pretty much the same combination of guys you see at any Apple store, in fact I think they\u0027ve franchised this combination: Hipster prodigy kid wearing skinny jeans and Keds; cool, sophisticated black dude with a halfro; hugely beardy questionable hygiene guy; a middle-aged square.CommentsCommittee to Protect JournalistsFor the last decade, Pakistan has been one of the world\u0027s most dangerous countries for the media. At least 46 journalists have been killed, 24 of them murdered for the \"crime\" of covering the intelligence services, the Taliban, separatists in Balochistan, or the criminal underworld.CommentsJohn SauerHead of External Relations, International Programs, Water For PeopleIn 2010, Water For People set out to support small scale entrepreneurs to be in a position to solve this problem for customers in Blantyre. One of these was a man named Matthias John.CommentsDee ReneFreelance writer and author in BrooklynI first learned my dad\u0027s birthday when he sent me a request on Facebook. For years, it was one piece of information that haunted me. When had the person that had given birth to me received life? I contemplated it as much as wondering the exact day he decided to leave me behind.CommentsAlan SingerSocial studies educator, Hofstra UniversityContrary to Common Core-aligned curriculum that declares \"free enterprise the pillar of the United States economy,\" I cannot find free enterprise described in any of the \"founding\" documents, or imbedded in the Constitution, of the United States.Comments (37)Paul ReiserActor, writer and standup comedianDave Brenner was in our living room with remarkable regularity, a saturation level I\u0027ve never seen equaled since. He was a guest on the Tonight Show, he hosted the Tonight Show, he was on Merv Grif?n, he was on Mike Douglas (for weeks at a time), he was on game shows... and, it seemed to me, always with new material. That kind of proli?c consistency takes a lot of hard work and dedication -- something I sensed would hit home with my dad.Comments (18)Bob BurnettBerkeley writer, retired Silicon Valley executiveThe Washington conventional wisdom argues the U.S. can\u0027t meet its energy needs, and reduce carbon emissions, without using natural gas as our primary energy source. This perspective has become one of the few points of agreement between Democrats and Republicans.Comments (125)Jackie K.
