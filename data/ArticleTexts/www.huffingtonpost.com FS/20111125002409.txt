{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Happy Thanksgiving, HuffPosters! There is much to be thankful for this year. I\u0027m thankful that the UC Davis police are not in charge of security at our offices. I\u0027m thankful that Herman Cain doesn\u0027t oversee HR here, that the supercommittee isn\u0027t responsible for determining our editorial budget, and that Mayor Bloomberg hasn\u0027t paid a visit to our nap rooms (he might find them a \"health and fire safety hazard\"). I\u0027m thankful my daughters are home from college for the holidays. I\u0027m thankful my move to New York has brought me a great new neighborhood filled with surprises around every corner. And I\u0027m very thankful for our great HuffPost team -- which rose to the challenge of adding 24 new sections since March -- and for our passionate, engaged community. How about you? What are you thankful for? Let us know in the comments section.Read Post | Comments (756)Dylan Ratigan, 11/24/11Host, MSNBC\u0027s \u0027The Dylan Ratigan Show\u0027; Author, soon to be released \u0027Greedy Bastards\u0027If we resolve to Occupy Ourselves -- to acknowledge all of ourselves -- especially our darkest aspects -- only then can we stop the fear that is running ourselves and our society.Read Post | Comments (163)Rita Wilson, 11/23/11Editor at Large, Huff/Post50; Actor and ProducerAs a kid I was thankful for my Barbie and her \"house\".

Daughters, Fathers, And The Changing American Family\u0027I think we have an indestructible hope that as bad as things get, if we work hard enough and talk long enough, we\u0027ll find our way out of the forest. It\u0027s who we are. And I\u0027m thankful for that.Read Post | CommentsCara Santa Maria, 11/24/11Science Correspondent, Huffington Post; Editor, Talk Nerdy to MeThis year, don\u0027t blame the turkey if the football game renders you unconscious.

No simple answer. It was a combination of things, probably starting when, though I am three-and-a-half years younger than my brother, I became the older brother.Read Post | CommentsLaurie David, 11/23/11Producer/Author/NRDC TrusteeCorporations are no longer allowed to advertise cigarettes on TV due to the potential impact it could have on our kids. When it comes to hard liquor, the government didn\u0027t ban it, the companies did it voluntarily. So, isn\u0027t it sugary sodas\u0027 turn?Read Post | Comments (308)Parker J. Palmer, 11/24/11Founder, Center for Courage \u0026 RenewalAs a Christian who does his best to take reason as seriously as I take faith, I find impossible to understand America as a \"Christian nation\" -- and I believe that there are vibrant possibilities in the fact that it is not.Read Post | Comments (32)Marian Wright Edelman, 11/24/11President, Children\u0027s Defense FundFor some families Thanksgiving may be the only meal of the year where they pause before eating to truly give thanks for the food in front of them.

Susan Russell, 11/23/11Senior Associate for Communication and Inclusion, All Saints Episcopal Church, Pasadena, Calif.Take that, Western Civilization. How are you doing, Institution of Marriage?
