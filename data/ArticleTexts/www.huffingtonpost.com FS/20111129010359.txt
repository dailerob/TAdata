{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Mitt Romney\u0027s brazenly dishonest ad is far from the garden-variety truth stretching we\u0027re used to in political campaigns. It is so breathtakingly cynical it should cause us to question whether a candidate that would put it forth is fit for any public office -- let alone the presidency. Along with being deceitful, the ad is also a challenge to the media. It\u0027s like when a toddler looks right at you and slowly and deliberately spills a glass of milk. The child wants to see the reaction. It\u0027s a test of boundaries. If there\u0027s no reaction, then the message is that it\u0027s okay. That Mitt Romney hasn\u0027t been forced to apologize for this ad, that he hasn\u0027t been forced to fire the team responsible for it, isn\u0027t just a failure of Romney\u0027s -- it\u0027s a failure of our media culture.Read Post | CommentsKeli Goff, 11/28/11Author, commentator and contributing editor, TheLoop21.comThose of us who are tired of this political posturing should remember that the real culprits in the political standoff over contraception are not conservatives.Read Post | CommentsTom Doctoroff, 11/28/11CEO, JWT North AsiaChina will not easily capture hearts and minds. They will be an economic superpower only. The Chinese are ethnocentric and in large ways and small, an instinct to narrowly defend interests can be off putting.Read Post | CommentsDylan Ratigan, 11/28/11Host, MSNBC\u0027s \u0027The Dylan Ratigan Show\u0027; Author, soon to be released \u0027Greedy Bastards\u0027Imagine if you could identify a small number of patients who end up eating up most health care dollars. Let\u0027s say you could focus resources just on them, while also cutting the overall amount of health care spending dramatically. This isn\u0027t fiction, it comes from Camden, New Jersey.Read Post | Comments (69)Ben Affleck and Cindy McCain, 11/28/11What do presidential and parliamentary elections in one of Africa\u0027s largest democracies have to do with you and with us?

What\u0027s more, you\u0027re probably thinking that getting down on yourself for overindulging is part of the cure.Read Post | CommentsLarry Magid, 11/28/11Technology journalistThere is a lot of talk about how social networks, search engines and even seemingly innocuous websites can invade our privacy, but the biggest risk to our privacy is what we post ourselves.Read Post | CommentsHilary Rosen, 11/28/11Communications, media and political strategistBarney Frank will always be my dear friend. But I will miss his vote counting, his policy analysis, his creativity and his ability to cut the opposition in half without breaking an intellectual sweat. There won\u0027t be another like him.Read Post | Comments (138)Craig Newmark, 11/28/11Founder, craigslist and craigconnects.orgRecently, Jeff Jarvis held an event on restoring fact-checking to the news business.

Gerard, 11/28/11International President, United SteelworkersAmericans don\u0027t like debt, including bills owed by their government. It weighs on them, even when it\u0027s to create jobs and speed recovery. That\u0027s why there was a deficit Super Committee. But for the majority of millionaires, incurring debt does not evoke anxiety.Read Post | Comments (664)Dean Baker, 11/28/11Co-Director of CEPR; Author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027It\u0027s time to expose the lies for what they are. The 1% have rigged the deck to accomplish the most massive upward redistribution in the history of the world. These are not people who care about budget deficits or free trade or free markets. They care about making themselves richer at the expense of everyone else.Read Post | Comments (144)Maria Lin, 11/28/11Editor-in-chief, LearnVestThere is something to be said for not unwittingly losing the \"warmth and conviviality\" in our lives as we grow in our financial prosperity.Read Post | CommentsLucas Kavner, 11/28/11Culture and Media Reporter, The Huffington PostMusic, in general, might be missing its lyrical heroes. Who are our real poets in 2011? With Occupy Wall Street and the recession and the slipping middle class, it seems like the right time for a new icon to emerge. One that speaks more directly to us, without hiding.Read Post | Comments (56)Elena Haliczer, 11/28/11Product development for HuffPost Social NewsWe\u0027re excited to team up with Facebook to bring you the latest in HuffPost Social News: The Huffington Post Social Reader.Read Post | Comments (26)Dennis A. Henigan, 11/28/11Acting President, Brady Campaign; Author, \u0027Lethal Logic\u0027Conservatives don\u0027t have to believe that concealed carry of loaded guns in public places poses unacceptable risks in order to be opposed to H.R. 822. Principled conservatives -- even those who think concealed carry is a positive good -- should be driven to the same conclusion.Read Post | Comments (65)Mary Hughes, 11/28/11Founder and Director, The 2012 ProjectTwenty years later, 1992 remains the high water mark for American women\u0027s gains in national elections. In fact, women\u0027s progress since then has been glacial. But as we head into the 2012 elections, there are signs that another gender-driven prairie fire may be igniting.Read Post | Comments (17)Vicki Larson, 11/26/11Journalist, mother, thinkerWhether you like his politics or not, there are two things about Newt Gingrich that almost all of us aren\u0027t too happy about: he\u0027s a cheater and he\u0027s twice-divorced.Read Post | Comments (634)Robert Kuttner, 11/27/11Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027All of the accounts of the current situation in Europe have some merit, yet all miss the deeper point. This crisis occurred because bankers and shadow bankers (such as the hedge funds that are betting against Europe\u0027s bonds) have too much power.Read Post | Comments (307)Raymond J. Learsy, 11/28/11Author, \u0027Oil and Finance: The Epic Corruption\u0027Sometimes it is not just the numbers. The human factor and historical imperatives need play their role in policy formation. For Germany and for Europe, much more is at stake than simply the balance sheet of the European Central Bank.Read Post | Comments (37)Jeffrey Sachs, 11/28/11Director, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \u0027The Price of Civilization\u0027Across the ideological spectrum, we all agree on the need to end crony capitalism. But let us also work together not to cripple government but to make it work for all Americans.Read Post | Comments (250)Charles Gasparino, 11/28/11Fox Business Network contributor; Author, \u0027Bought and Paid For\u0027Just a few months ago Jon Corzine was on the short list to be Treasury Secretary, but now he\u0027s ignoring a request to testify before a subcommittee investigating the demise MF Global and setting up a showdown that could have major implications for the president\u0027s re-election.Read Post | CommentsBarry Levinson, 11/28/11Academy Award-winning director, screenwriter and producerIf that great comedy team were still alive, the routine on our unemployment woes might go something like this.Read Post | Comments (115)David Frum, 11/27/11Editor, FrumForum.comA Gingrich presidency, if such a thing can even be imagined, would be a chaotic catastrophe. A Gingrich nomination would yield an Obama landslide. So that leaves us with the two governors, Mitt Romney and Jon Huntsman.Read Post | Comments (653)Soraya Chemaly, 11/28/11Feminist satirist and media criticThink about how many movies you see where the woman, beautiful and sexy, is the source of the leading man\u0027s vulnerability and then, ultimately, his reward.Read Post | CommentsBren Shucart, 2011.11.28Keli Goff, 2011.11.28John K.
