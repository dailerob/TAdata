{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor, historian, authorThe same Republican leaders who mined birtherism, xenophobia, and racist dog whistles for political gold, and who failed to stop the Trump clown car when they had the chance, are now gearing up to pantomime a unified party. Reliable number crunchers have already compiled masses of data showing that Trump is toxic with women voters, Latinos, evangelicals, immigrants, Muslims and other religious minorities, and young people. Add this level of voter estrangement to the rancor the GOP establishment has already shown toward Trump, ranging from grudging acceptance to outright opposition, and there emerges an anti-Trump pincer movement with crucial blocs of voters rejecting him from below, while big Republican donors and party insiders rebuff him from above.So, awaiting final toxicology, it has now been reported in the New York Times that Prince was toxic. I can relate. I was toxic too.Actress and children\u0027s book authorI look at the long lines at polling stations, the broken machines, the disenfranchised voters and I wonder if having citizens vote is much of a priority in this country. We need to fix a system that we all know is broken. Tolerating it only exacerbates the problem and leads to more and more disillusionment that results in less and less voters.ActorCunha\u0027s removal from the Lower House has both legal and moral implications. After all, the most important court in the country has finally imposed the first and foremost defeat of one of the icons of Brazil\u0027s current ethical and political disaster.Editor in Chief at HuffPost BrasilHappy first day of a half year of living with the possibility (however remote we have to believe it to be in order to stay sane) that Donald Trump - this crass and crude boor, this bloodthirsty psychopath, this Brobdingnagian narcissist, this proudly misogynistic ignoramus, this pus-filled boil of hate, this odious short-fingered vulgarian - could be the 45th President of the United States.Paul Slansky is amassing a memory for Americans allergic to accountability and addicted to amnesia.Looking to celebrate Cinco de Mayo like a true Mexican? Well that won\u0027t happen because they don\u0027t celebrate the holiday in Mexico. While it does reference historic events, it\u0027s a day North Americans have re-appropriated so they could throw \"fiestas\" with salsa, sombreros, and margaritas.Empowering a new generation of digital voicesDecades ago, Gloria Steinem had talked about the \"click,\" moments, those aha, revelatory, eureka moments when a woman suddenly recognizes the gender discrimination she faces. I am sorry to say, I never had one of those consciousness-raising moments. Until now.Author, \u0027The Space Between Us\u0027Ah, Cinco De Mayo. I can smell it now: the tacos, the margaritas, the racism. Here\u0027s how to show the Latino people around you that you don\u0027t really care for them as humans.Writer, satirist, tiny dancerAllowing more charters schools -- online or not -- without planning and oversight robs communities of stable, safe schools where children can learn from great teachers. All children deserve a quality education.Executive Director, In the Public InterestResearch has shown that when you cultivate a healthy work environment for nurses, you also improve the quality of overall health care for patients.35th president of the American Nurses Association (ANA), which represents the nation’s 3.4 million registered nurses.It\u0027s safe to say, looking at who Donald Trump is turning to now, that it\u0027s unlikely there will be any progress on LGBT rights -- and would likely be great harm to them -- under a Trump presidency.Queer Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostA baby is born with ALD every 36 hours in America. The tragedy is most parents won\u0027t know it. Currently, newborn screening is a state-by-state matter. In 2013, New York became the first state in the US to test all newborns for ALD.Founder, Aidan Jack Seeger FoundationIt only takes a gander down one allee of the Frieze Art Fair to realize just how important and prescient was Roberto Burle Marx, the Brazilian landscape architect and subject of a new Jewish Museum retrospective, how very contemporary in his cross-media grazing (landscape, architecture, jewelry design, sculpture, painting, drawing, tapestry, collage), how elegant and unique his view of the world.Culture Columnist, Huffington Post, CultureZohnBill O\u0027Reilly has every right to say that some kids are just bad apples, out of control, and should be carted off by constables. But educators have got be committed to proving him wrong.Veteran high school teacher and basketball coach; author, \u0027Students First and Other Lies\u0027One angle of the saga of Hamilton, both on-stage and off, that has not been commented on is how it shows the value of time off. Alexander Hamilton wasn\u0027t just the subject of our country\u0027s first sex scandal. He was perhaps also our first fully documented case -- and the founding father -- of political burnout.What happens next will test the character for all of us - Republican, Democrat, and Independent. It will determine whether we move forward as one nation or splinter at the hands of one man\u0027s narcissism and divisiveness.Democratic Senator from MassachusettsIf it can be imagined, it can be achieved. The fact that the IRS has essentially looked the other way when it comes to the unlawful use of personally identifiable information in the face of our identity crime Armageddon is inexcusable.Author of Swiped. Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Co-founder of Credit.com and IDT911Men give themselves more room for failure, and tend to be more forgiving toward themselves. In the workplace, there are few places where this difference in perception rears its ugly head as much as in self-assessments, which are now commonplace as a step before a performance review takes place.President \u0026 Co-founder of FairygodbossA law has been passed that is not merely about the bathroom or even transgender equality. A law has been passed that is in the service of something that undercuts everything this country was designed to withstand.Author of House of Leaves, Only Revolutions and The FamiliarAs it turns out, you have been as sideswiped, as sucker-punched, as drop-kicked as the rest of us. We feel for you. And there can be no overstatement about it. Your party has done the unthinkable: It\u0027s made Donald Trump\u0027s ascendency to the GOP nomination for the president of the United States.Sass \u0026 SensibilityThe president makes me proud to be a Black man and proud to be an American. He puts respeck on all of our names by the example he sets. I root for him the way I root for all of my n***as. Obama wants to see me win. I believe that.Writer. Learner. Learner. Learner.Whether they seek to overthrow it, try to seize control within its limits, rebel against it and become outcasts, try to survive its perils, use their position of authority within it or manipulate their way forward, all of the women of Westeros have one problem in common.Writer and radio hostAs tough as this may be for people to hear, as long as I do not harm anyone with my headscarf, then no one needs to harm me by asking me to take it off.Student with Pakistani roots, Ahmadiyya MuslimAt the end of the day, it comes down to what \"values\" are the true metric of \"value investing\": shareholder return or public health. As a nation we have answered that question for tobacco, but we are clearly still debating it for sugar water.Executive Director, Center for Science in the Public InterestIf the past 20 years are a guide, Sino-Russian cooperation will result in a shared isolation of both countries\u0027 citizens from international civil society, international media and the Internet. A recent meeting between the two countries on Internet sovereignty was apparently motivated by a desire to protect against extremism, drug sales and the like. But the essence of it was two major nations getting together to compare notes on how to build walls.Former Sr. Advisor to the United Nations and International Crisis Group; author, \u0027Splinternet: How Geopolitics and Commerce Are Fragmenting the World Wide Web.\u0027Banks and payday lenders have had a good deal going for a while: They could break the law, trick their customers in illegal ways, and not have to face any consumer lawsuits.Executive Director, Public JusticeThis is one of the rare occasions where the love of charters and the disinterest in teachers is right there under the President\u0027s name and not, say, a Secretary of Education. Public school teachers -- take your week of weak praise and get back to finishing the work you haven\u0027t done yet.Teacher and writer; blogger, curmudgucation.blogspot.comLooking back on my decision to leave, I wouldn\u0027t change a thing. It made us better partners, fostering trust and appreciation. To be honest, our relationship has flourished because of the time spent apart and continues to reflect that to this day, nearly a year since we reunited.Writer, blogger, teacherIt\u0027s a story close to my heart. And as a kid growing up in India, it\u0027s the story of my childhood. No, I wasn\u0027t a human cub raised by wolves in the Indian jungle. But I was raised in Mumbai by my grandparents.Integrative Medicine Physician, Harvard Medical SchoolNow that Governor Kasich is suspending his campaign, will the party come together and enthusiastically support its standard-barer?Hofstra Journalism ProfessorIf you care about protecting the environment, if you care about raising revenue for the state, if you care about protecting young people, if you care about communities harmed by our past drug policies, if you care about racial justice, then you should care about the Adult Use of Marijuana Act.Staff Attorney, Drug Policy AllianceGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
