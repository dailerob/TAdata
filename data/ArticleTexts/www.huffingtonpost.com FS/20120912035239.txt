{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Last Friday we learned that only 96,000 jobs had been added in August and unemployment stood at 8.1 percent, down from 8.3 percent largely because of 368,000 people leaving the workforce altogether. Every month, the range of our expectations is now limited to \"might be a little bit better,\" or \"might be a little bit worse.\" The idea of a \"wow, those are great numbers\" report doesn\u0027t even seem like a possibility anymore. That\u0027s why citizens\u0027 role in the process needs to be more than just hoping for a good number to be delivered from the Washington skies. So as we enter the final lap of the election -- and the billion dollar deluge of less-than-edifying television ads that will come with it -- let\u0027s remember that we don\u0027t have to wait for Washington to act to take care of our own.Read Post | Comments (36)Tim Armstrong, 09/11/12Chairman and CEO of AOLIn a matter of minutes and hours, an act that was meant to freeze the country and our freedom, led to an outpouring of immediate action.

El-Erian, 09/11/12CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOCentral bankers seem to be the only policymakers both willing and able to respond to many unusual challenges. Yes they are using imperfect tools.

Haass, 09/11/12President, Council on Foreign RelationsWhat 9/11 shows us is that while terrorists can destroy, they are unable to create. They are not the inspiration behind the upheavals in the Arab world. Terrorists offer no alternative, only violence.Read Post | Comments (25)Lincoln Mitchell, 09/11/12Harriman Institute, Columbia UniversityIf Romney loses, there will be lots of explanations and excuses offered by people associated with the Republican Party.

Spending trillions on secret wars, secret trials, offshore prisons and forever prisoners? There\u0027s no future in that.Read Post | Comments (374)Dean Praetorius, 09/11/12Director of Trends and Social Media, The Huffington PostSocial media would undoubtedly have painted a clearer picture of what happened inside the towers in 2001. Many argue it\u0027s an image we don\u0027t want to imagine. Yet gruesome as resulting imagery could have been, the benefits of having social media on that day may have been profound.Read Post | Comments (35)Joseph A.
