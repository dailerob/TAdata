{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week, Mika Brzezinski and I hosted our second Third Metric conference. Last year, we had 300 people crammed into my living room. This year, we had over 2,000 people at the New York City Center -- all embracing the notion that success needs to be redefined beyond money and power. Over the two days of the event, we were collectively inspired, moved, encouraged and galvanized as we heard from neuroscientists, authors, singers, entrepreneurs, yoga instructors, CEOs, comedians and medical doctors. And we took away practical tools and tips to allow us to incorporate more well-being, wisdom, wonder and giving into our daily lives. We wanted the conference to serve as a bridge -- from knowing to doing, from idea to action. Thanks to everyone, onstage and off, who crossed that bridge with us -- and you can make the journey too by watching the video of the event here.Hopefully today\u0027s name change, so meaningful to me personally, can also raise awareness of the fact that we trans* people exist everywhere in America today, and that we must jump through hurdles every day just for being who we are.Chelsea ManningFormer U.S. Army intelligence analyst, military whistleblower and democracy advocateWould you do this to your own mother? Would you starve her, ravage her, drill her, strip her, pollute her, poison her, frack her, crowd her, pave her, drain her, extract her, constrain her, imprison her?Jamie Lee CurtisActress and children\u0027s book authorIt would be too easy to wash one\u0027s hands and blame politicians for their failure to address climate change. Any failure would be collective. Responding to climate change is everyone\u0027s responsibility.Jimmy CarterMary RobinsonIn 2008 Oprah and the spiritual teacher and author Eckhart Tolle held a number of conversations as part of their Web series Oprah \u0026 Eckhart Tolle: A New Earth. Now they\u0027re bringing those episodes to television for the first time, Sundays at noon on OWN, the Oprah Winfrey Network. Since my new book Thrive is concerned with many of the same questions, I asked Tolle about the series, why this is a conversation we as a society need to have now, and the moment he knew he needed to change his life. Here\u0027s our conversation.Arianna HuffingtonBy carving out time away from being busy, I have been able to think clearly about my long-term goals. I have avoided jumping on the treadmill when I know that I should keep going at my own pace. And while I can still feel guilty about it, I sometimes slow down to soak in the moment.Nafees SyedLaw student, Former Congressional stafferOf course, the National Review has every right under the First Amendment to say all of these things, and I would defend to the death, in Voltaire\u0027s words, its right to say them. But that does not make them any less offensive -- or ignorant of the law.Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoYou might assume that, four years after the spill, the U.S. would have implemented the safeguards and policies needed to prevent similar disasters. But you\u0027d be wrong. We\u0027ve made little progress in preventing future spills, and the situation is getting worse.Ted DansonAndrew SharplessChildren, women and a scattering of men, who have endured unspeakable violence and anguish, loss and horror, agony -- biblical in force and nature -- and have responded with unbounded love. Redemption. Resurrection. Faith. I leave Haiti with these gifts in abundance.Kerry KennedyPresident, Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human RightsYour spouse is growing distant. You\u0027re terrified of losing your job. Your teenager is driving you insane. On the inside, you\u0027re falling apart. But from the outside, no one would ever know.Panache DesaiContemporary thought leader and spiritual teacherIs anyone really surprised by the alleged recorded statements of Donald Sterling to his girlfriend? Hasn\u0027t it been well-documented that he has made racist comments such as these multiple times in the past?Etan ThomasAuthor, poet, philanthropist, 11-year NBA veteranThe case for providing the basics for all children in America is hard to refute. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 2.2 million children were lifted out of poverty by SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, in 2012. Yet right now we are fast approaching a critical time for hungry children: summer vacation.Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundYou and me? We can contribute to a more awake, or enlightened, society on a day-to-day level, using mindfulness as a way to become more clear on how to do that.Lodro RinzlerAuthor of \u0027The Buddha Walks into a Bar\u0027 and \u0027Walk Like a Buddha\u0027The armed gathering of pro-gun activists, anti-government groups and right-wing-politicians at Bundy\u0027s ranch did not happen in a political vacuum.Josh HorwitzExecutive Director, Coalition to Stop Gun ViolenceIn addition to improving the way we use water, we need to prevent future egregious waste. Solving our water crisis absolutely requires that we pass a moratorium on fracking and other dangerous drilling practices that use a tremendous amount of water.Sandra FlukeCandidate for CA State Senate SD-26And at state and local levels, while the poorest fifth of Americans pay an average tax rate of over 11 percent, the richest one percent of the country pay -- are you ready for this? -- half that rate.Bill MoyersManaging Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyAll video streaming companies including Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and others now have to offer closed captioning by April 30, 2014 or else be subject to the same fines as traditional broadcast television.Marlee MatlinAcademy Award-winning actressFor Christians, caring for God\u0027s creation should be a priority. It is not just a matter of science or politics, but an indication of our worship and praise of the Creator.Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersA recent study out of MIT even suggests that analyzing crowd statements on Twitter may allow researchers to predict the future, citing as one example early tweets associated with the 2013 coup d\u0027état in Egypt. But Twitter -- and all that accessible information -- has some undeniable downsides, too.Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarMy life prior to student loan debt and the economic collapse of 2008 was one of promise. I was a straight \"A\" student in high school and I have earned two degrees. I am a law abiding citizen and have never been arrested.DJ CookFormer high school history teacherIn the first few weeks, the community really supports the rape victim, but then there is a shift and the rape victim becomes isolated while the community circles around to defend the perpetrator.Terry O\u0027NeillPresident, National Organization for WomenWhile I\u0027m happy for any conversation about gender gaps that need closing, I\u0027m not interested in teaching adult women how to become more confident. I want women to keep the confidence they have as young girls. The confidence we, collectively, crush.Soraya ChemalyFeminist, Writer, Satirist... not always in that orderThe BP spill should have been a wake-up call for elected officials and organizations tasked with responding to this type of disaster, but it seems like those in charge of protecting our waters have learned nothing.Mark RuffaloScott SmithJohn L. PrattJon HotchkissCreator, ThisvsThatShow.comFrom this list I deduced that, lo and behold, I was indeed happy, even thrilled, with the life I\u0027d be able to have with my two daughters. I was willing to let go of the first two items to be able to participate in the rest of them.Mike ReynoldsFather of two and blogger at PuzzlingPosts.comWhat does it look like for campuses to have comprehensive, survivor-oriented sexual assault policies? There are key steps to creating safer campuses.Selena ShenTracey E. VitchersIf we want to counter the rise in inequality that we have seen in recent decades we are going to have to find other mechanisms for reversing this upward redistribution than a politically infeasible global wealth tax. Specifically, we will have to look to ways to reduce the rents earned by the wealthy. These rents stem from government interventions in the economy that have the effect of redistributing income upward. Fortunately, we have a full bag of policy tools to accomplish precisely this task. The best place to start is the financial industry, primarily since this sector is so obviously a ward of the state and in many ways a drain on the productive economy.Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027This will not be the last time someone discounts my son because he is different. It will not be the last time someone makes a joke at his expense, but to actively seek out actual people to tease goes beyond cruel. It\u0027s inhuman.Megan Davies MennesEnglish teacher, writer, motherIn this life-affirming video, Sue Austin goes where few have been... in her wheelchair. Refusing to be defined by pity or limitations, she proves that we can\u0027t let ourselves be defined by how other people see us -- and that telling our own story sets us free.TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"As a social worker, my Mom dedicated her career to helping other people. After she retired, she volunteered helping immigrant students prepare for their GEDs. Because of her, I\u0027ve always been curious about other countries and cultures, and have tried to find ways to help people in need.Amanda PeetActress, mother, Every Child By Two Ambassador to the Shot@Life CampaignI want to talk about the fallout when senior management chooses to politicize their brands.
