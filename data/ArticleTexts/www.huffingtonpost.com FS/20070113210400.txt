{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"From cpsb.org/files.blog-city.comThe yin and yang of Iraq proposals -- President Bush\u0027s troop escalation speech, and Sen. Kennedy\u0027s measure calling for a Congressional vote before any escalation can take place -- rightly dominated the week\u0027s headlines, and our bloggers had plenty to say about both. Don\u0027t miss Rep. Jane Harman, Rep. John Conyers, Jane Smiley, Nathan Gardels, Larry Beinhart, Rep. Jim McDermott, Stephen Elliott, Nadim al-Jabari, Suzanne Nossel, David Kuo, Stephen Schlesinger, Martin Lewis, and Rep. Jan Schakowsky on Bush\u0027s depressingly familiar New Way Forward (my presidential diagnosis is here), and Bob Cesca, Kathleen Reardon, Stephen Kaus, Bill Robinson, Michael Shaw, Chris Weigant, and Alec Baldwin on Kennedy\u0027s attempt to thwart what he termed the president\u0027s \"policy of desperation built on denial and fantasy.\" Plus our Featured Roundup below.READ POST01.12.2007 Sen. Jim WebbWhile the President and his top cabinet officials spent the week testifying in support of their new strategy for victory, Americans are left with an even foggier view of what it\u0027s going to take to get us there.READ POST | comments (130)01.09.2007 Gary HartHistory has already judged the invasion and occupation of Iraq as an American disaster of epic proportions. But what damage has been done to the U.S. Constitution and our form of government?READ POST | comments (111)01.08.2007 Nora EphronHere\u0027s the deal, Nancy, there\u0027s no justification for sending 20,000 more troops to Iraq. No matter what President Bush says. There\u0027s no justification at all.READ POST | comments (107)01.07.2007 Esther DysonI recently almost got a job as a monthly columnist for a national print publication. However, I couldn\u0027t sign the contract that said \"without limitation... take no money from potential news sources.\"READ POST | comments (38)01.11.2007 Rep. John MurthaIt is unacceptable to me that we are sending troops back to Iraq who have not completed their training cycle and that we are extending troops who are battle- weary from the intensive combat in Iraq.READ POST | comments (84)01.09.2007 Sen. Edward M. KennedyThe President must make clear the mission of our troops and lay out a path to bring them home, and Congress must stop being a rubberstamp for failed policies and stand up and act.READ POST | comments (113)01.10.2007 Bob CescaThis address was, from beginning to end, a flim flam. The \"new way forward\" contained so many loopholes we\u0027d all have to be high right along with him to actually believe it.READ POST | comments (72)01.11.2007 Elayne BooslerI\u0027m the Decider \u003d Let the Democrats come up with a plan; Rebuild Iraq \u003d Not rebuild New OrleansREAD POST | comments (32)01.11.2007 Eason JordanThe Iraqi government consistently fails to meet its security objectives; it\u0027s highly unlikely the Iraqi government will oversee responsibility for security in all of Iraq by November.READ POST | comments (31)01.10.2007 Arianna HuffingtonSo there you have it. The New Way Forward. The promise of great new things followed up by the delivery of more of the same failed thinking and policies.READ POST | comments (228)01.10.2007 E. A.
