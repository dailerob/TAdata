{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Black Voices Editor, The Huffington PostThe agony pulsing through Charleston, SC, today is the same piercing pain felt each time a black life is lost to the acts of bigots and brutality. It is the familiar pain felt each time a black life is violently dehumanized, devalued and disposed of -- often without repercussion. It\u0027s not breaking news that being black in America can be difficult and frightening, to say the least. Now, more than ever, we cannot ignore or mask the reality that we live in a country where one’s complexion is a direct threat to their safety and livelihood. The massacre will be investigated as a hate crime, Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen said. However, by definition, we should see it as a domestic act of terrorism, and the gunman, a terrorist.As soon as I heard about the mass killing of nine worshipers at Charleston\u0027s Emanuel AME Church, my heart broke -- again. Yet another gunman, yet another place that should be safe from violence, even more families shattered. No more Charlestons. No more Newtowns, Auroras or Isla Vistas. Not one more.Founder, Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in AmericaI am by no means a minister who is going to tell people who are subject to racism not to be angry. I am, however, going to say that this moment needs our faith. This moment needs our focus. And in spite of this young man\u0027s attempt destroy the sanctity of prayer, we need prayer.Ordained minister in the United Church of Christ. Associate Minister at Brown Memorial Baptist Church in Brooklyn.I remember when the news out of Ferguson, Missouri first came to us. I heard white friends and colleagues encourage each other to sit in a posture of listening. I honor that listening. White allies, I thank you for your thoughtfulness in this regard. Now allow me to be your stopwatch; time\u0027s up.Teaching Elder, Presbyterian Church (USA); Pastor, Unity Presbyterian Church in Temple Hills, MarylandWhen white people go on shooting sprees, their actions are frequently attributed to mental illness and, thus, they’re not considered fully accountable for the harm they’ve inflicted. This narrative -- which is not afforded to people of color -- excuses the system that allows racialized terrorism to keep happening.Staff Reporter, The Huffington PostThursday morning I posted the obligatory Facebook status, encouraging others to pray for all involved and affected by this massacre. When stuff like this happens, it\u0027s easy to sputter over your words and sometimes, prayer is all you\u0027ve got.Writer, Author, TherapistAs the Charleston community comes together in mourning, it is important to also come together to reflect on how such a tragedy could happen in the first place, and what must be done at a larger, societal level to prevent this from happening again.Tracy Fehr Sardone is a human rights practitioner and independent journalist. She currently resides in Charleston, SC.Black Churches have been under attack for hundreds of years, dating back to slavery. Be it bombings during the civil rights movement, or Black Churches being set on fire, the Black Church has been under perpetual attack since its inception.Author, Speaker, Coach, ConsultantWhen I woke up to news of another church shooting -- of nine people killed in the place you feel safest -- I only want to share the parts that ripped me up. The parts that are still confusing and raw. Because that\u0027s what it feels like when someone comes into your life with a gun and tries to kill you.Director of outreach, Canterbury United Methodist ChurchThe facts of this tragedy remain under investigation, and there is still a lot that we don\u0027t know. But what we do know is that every day, 88 Americans are killed in shootings. No, there is not a single magic solution that will keep every gun out of the hands of every person intent on doing harm -- but we can do a lot better.Dan Gross is President of the Brady Campaign and Center to Prevent Gun Violence, united with the Million Mom MarchIs it the sound of one million Mamie Tills mourning over one million Emmetts, one million Sybrina Fultons mourning over one million Trayvons and one million Samaria Rices mourning over one million Tamirs? Or is it a pain so deep that tears fall, yet no sound is made?Award-Winning Author of Freestyle: Reflections on Faith, Family, Justice, and Pop Culture; Founding Pastor of Joy Tabernacle A.M.E. Church in Dallas, TexasFor more than a decade and at very considerable expense, the United States has been attempting to create an Iraqi government that governs and an Iraqi army that fights; the results of those efforts speak for themselves: they have failed abysmally.Author, \u0027The Limits of Power: The End of American Exceptionalism\u0027To that small minority who see this crime against humanity as a victory: Know that God is with the people of Mother Emanuel. God is with those working to end gun violence. Yes, God takes sides and calls those of us who follow that call to take sides with both humbleness and a fierce desire for justice.Director of the Center for Peace and Spirituality and University Chaplain at Pacific UniversityTo all of you who have lost a father whom you have loved dearly and who showed you that love right back, I hope you can embrace Father\u0027s Day with a spirit of gratitude and courage. In my father, God gave me the greatest gift ever: an angel to watch over me. And, this Sunday, I will celebrate him.Emmy Award-winning journalist, producer and TV hostI doubt you even know any people that Mexico \"sent.\" So, let me introduce you. I am the daughter of one of the people that Mexico \"sent.\"Public relations professional and former broadcast journalistIt\u0027s not enough to tell our daughters to stand up for themselves. Part of putting an end to harassment involves educating boys to be completely accepting of women, both at home and at work, so that harassment becomes a relic of the past.Journalist, wife, mama, author of Getting Real, and Fox News Host of The Real Story with Gretchen Carlson weekdays 2PM EST.I hope that the discussion on Grexit will remain at a theoretical level and that the Greek people will not experience the real consequences of a default.Member of the European Parliament, New Democracy PartyThe suspected racially motivated massacre at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, SC by alleged shooter Dylann Roof drew shocked gasps, rage and a renewed focus on hate violence in the country. That\u0027s fine. But it doesn\u0027t focus on the continued greater danger: Hate crimes still remain grossly under-reported and prosecuted.Author and political analystHere Ed Kane discusses how changes in corporate law and culture must make it legally and socially unacceptable for bankers to blow their toxic fumes at the rest of us.Author and cultural theoristAre these types of rampage shootings on the rise, or does it just seem that way? Whether it\u0027s a lone wolf or an organized group matters little to the victims. Maybe now is a good time to enact legislation that even a majority of gun owners want.Political science professor, LaGrange College in GeorgiaPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideEmanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church teaches us, at great cost, that politics -- politics done right and righteously -- is actually deeply spiritual. And religion -- religion done right and righteously -- is actually deeply political.Author, \u0027Fresh Air: The Holy Spirit for an Inspired Life\u0027This massacre occurred on the very anniversary of a failed slave revolt, a rebellion that played a significant role in the African American liberation movement in South Carolina. Last night, that church that was torn by bullets. Violence is not God\u0027s path. We must sing louder than weapons.Editor, \u0027Peace in Our Cities: Rabbis Against Gun Violence\u0027The Pope, by the way, is not bringing religion to the debate; he is simply acknowledging that the science is overwhelming and compelling, and given that, there is a moral obligation to act.Scientist and former White House Senior Policy Analyst; Ph.D. in marine biology/neurophysiologyAs I headed to bed Wednesday night, a white gunman shot and killed nine people in an historic black church in the center of town just four blocks from where I used to live. Unaware of the evil, sleep came quickly. But in the wee hours, the ping of a text from an Australian colleague woke me.Publisher, Statehouse ReportAs is the case with every horrific incident of gun violence in this country, we ask the same questions: Were there warning signs? How could this have been prevented? And in this case, it\u0027s hard not to ask: What might have been different if Texas had a \"Gun Violence Restraining Order\" (GVRO) policy in place?Executive Director, Coalition to Stop Gun ViolenceThe U.S. inability to help resolve the myriad island disputes in Asia and its failure to overcome domestic resistance to the TPP suggest that a time will come quite soon when America no longer rules the waves in the Pacific (or has the hegemonic power to waive the rules).Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogWe can\u0027t walk the streets of our own neighborhoods. We can\u0027t be buckled in or have our rights respected when arrested, or locked up without trial, assaulted and beaten in an American prison. We can\u0027t be youth at a pool party. We can\u0027t be at church. We can\u0027t be president and really comment about these things. We can\u0027t breathe...Doctor, adventurer, world traveler, reader, writer, listener, and not-so-quiet observer of pretty much everything around him. Not your typical black, gay, physician.Old people have sex. They have it in many places; they even have it in nursing homes. They have heterosexual sex, same-sex sex, sex with multiple partners, and sex with themselves. But for some reason, the very fact that older people have sex makes younger people uncomfortable.Senior Writer/Columnist, The Huffington PostPhysicians and health professionals have lowered the rates of many deadly infectious diseases by instituting careful, data-driven, broadly-instituted approaches like hand-washing, universal vaccination, and food and drug quality laws. We need to consider firearms and bullets as pathogens, similar to the smallpox virus and its disease, smallpox.Pediatrician, teacher, parent, photographer, advocate for improved child health and safetyThe world\u0027s water challenges are technical, economic, political, and social issues, but the Vatican Encyclical reminds us that ultimately they are ethical and moral issues as well.President, Pacific InstituteGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
