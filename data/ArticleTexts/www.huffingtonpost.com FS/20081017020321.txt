{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOMcCain scored the zinger of the night with, \"I am not President Bush. If you wanted to run against President Bush, you should have run four years ago.\" But his performance was, in fact, incredibly Bush-like, mirroring Bush\u0027s signature stubbornness -- especially on Iraq -- by doubling down on a failed strategy. McCain\u0027s reliance on angry attacks on Obama has been an unequivocal failure. But instead of course-correcting, he doubled down -- coming across as angrier and meaner than ever before. This debate was won on the reaction shots. Every time Obama spoke, McCain grimaced, sneered, or rolled his eyes. By contrast, every time McCain was on the attack, Obama smiled. It was like watching a split-screen double feature -- Grumpy Old Men playing side by side with Cool Hand Luke.Read Post | CommentsBIOMike Barnicle, 10.16.2008It is a sad story: a proud and independent man permits a handful of advisers to take his hard-earned reputation and alter it to such an extent that the original is now hard to recognize.Read Post | CommentsBIONora Ephron, 10.16.2008If John McCain thinks Americans are angry, it\u0027s either because he\u0027s projecting, or else he\u0027s simply been going to too many of his own rallies.Read Post | Comments (282)BIOCecile Richards, 10.16.2008The debate last night was just the most vivid example of what we\u0027ve known all along: John McCain is out of touch on women\u0027s health.Read Post | Comments (113)BIOHilary Rosen, 10.16.2008In all, there is not much new in the Republican playbook this year -- and that continues to be their real problem and our real opportunity.Read Post | Comments (44)BIODavid Kirby, 10.16.2008The media may be transfixed on \"Joe the Plumber\" today, but the real winner of last night\u0027s debate was autism. No single disorder has ever been so prominent in a national election.Read Post | Comments (44)BIONancy Keenan, 10.16.2008The same woman who wants a president to address the difficulty of paying to put gas in the car while other bills pile up also wants a president who respects her ability to make personal decisions.Read Post | Comments (35)BIOHenry Blodget, 10.16.2008When the value of the asset drops below the value of the debt used to buy it, poof -- the owner\u0027s equity just went to zero. So it\u0027s not just Wall Street that is rapidly developing a distaste for leverage.Read Post | CommentsBIOMarty Kaplan, 10.15.2008Ninety minutes of John McCain making faces was more than enough for a lifetime. It\u0027s hard to imagine anyone willingly inviting that antic lemon-sucking grinfest into their homes for the next four years.Read Post | Comments (291)BIOJudy Muller, 10.16.2008When it comes to dismissive finger gestures, there is nothing quite like the two-handed \"air quote.\" For pure sarcastic appeal, it beats the much more obvious middle finger every time. But beware what words you put inside those little air quotes.Read Post | CommentsBIOSteven Waldman, 10.16.2008McCain won the battle to most thrill the activists but Obama got the bigger prize: he defined himself as a reasonable seeker of the common ground.Read Post | Comments (66)BIOMichael Seitzman, 10.16.2008Mccain and Palin and their ilk don\u0027t laugh. They patronize. They don\u0027t smile, they snicker. They don\u0027t debate, they denigrate. They don\u0027t talk, they condescend. They don\u0027t argue, they ridicule.Read Post | Comments (101)BIOKatie Halper, 10.16.2008Read Post | CommentsBob Cesca, 10.15.2008Mitchell Bard, 10.16.2008William Friedkin, 10.15.2008Christine Wicker, 10.16.2008Eric Deggans, 10.16.2008Robert Shrum, 10.15.2008Glenn W.
