{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressThe media needs to recognize that the true center of gravity in the Ebola story is the crisis in West Africa. That\u0027s the situation that has to be emphasized, even if we have ongoing cases of the disease in the United States. This is not to say that you don\u0027t cover what\u0027s going on in America -- that information is, of course, vital. But the origin of any domestic cases of Ebola will be West Africa. Solving that crisis solves our own. So when you cover the story, don\u0027t forget to mention West Africa. Lead with it, focus on it, keep people up to speed with what\u0027s happening there. Talk to the people fighting the disease there. Ask policymakers tough questions about what they\u0027re going to do about it. And if you write some listicle about Ebola, end with it. Because that\u0027s where the media can do the most good right now.I\u0027m not worried about Ebola. I\u0027m worried about America. I\u0027m worried about our confidence and courage.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Many Americans probably think of it as our sleepy socialist neighbor to the north. But Canada is a key ally in the war against terrorism in general, and ISIS in particular. And today\u0027s attack is a harbinger of things to come in America.Political science professor, LaGrange College in GeorgiaWhile KFC and Komen earn millions selling pink buckets of fried chicken and Boar\u0027s Head pink-wraps its meats, women could do more to combat breast cancer by convincing their friends and family members to say no to pink-beribboned animal products and yes to the produce aisle.President and co-founder, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA)The real question is, why should women\u0027s access to health services be dependent on whatever ideologies currently prevail among legislators?President, National Organization for WomenThe administration\u0027s Iraq policy has failed. The U.S. is more entangled in conflict and war; Americans have been killed in retaliation for Washington\u0027s intervention; the Islamic State is still advancing; U.S. allies continue to free ride on America; Washington hopes to square a nonexistent circle in Syria.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteThe companies that succeed in solving the problems of pandemics will surely reap the large financial returns that Silicon Valley looks for. But the social returns will be far greater.Academic, Researcher, Writer, EntrepreneurAs expected, the news of Ben Bradlee\u0027s passing brought accolades for his work as editor of The Washington Post. He and the Post helped instill a new word into our national vocabulary: Watergate. But my one encounter with Mr. Bradlee was in a different context.Journalist and authorWhen will there be a good news day? One news day where the news is so good that it is the story of the day. A day that excites all Americans, whether they are Republicans, Democrats, or any other political persuasion. The news is so good that all the news coverage is overwhelmed by this wonderful event.Academy Award-winning director, screenwriter and producerEvery taxpayer, business, and government agency in America is supposed to be able to pass a financial audit by the feds, every year. It\u0027s the law, so we do our duty. There\u0027s one exception: the Pentagon.Co-founder, CODEPINK: Women for PeaceNow they plan to enter another realm, one inhabited by giants more powerful and more devious than they HBO, CBS, Lionsgate or Tribeca can ever imagine. It\u0027s one thing to be carried as part of a cable package. It\u0027s another to be streamed, and to be at the utter mercy of Comcast, Verizon and AT\u0026T.Communications consultantLet me start by saying that I\u0027m a fan. But then you did that interview with GQ. I was more than a little disappointed with the things you had to say about the Washington football team\u0027s name and logo, and I think we need to have a talk.Writer, producer, and member of the 1491s, a sketch comedy groupLocally our gasoline and diesel purchases are the most lethal toxin in American politics. Just a couple of weeks out from the election it\u0027s good to remind ourselves -- lots of voters may not think the ballot counts, but Big Oil knows better.Former executive director and chairman, Sierra ClubRunning used to appear on my to-do list somewhere before \"get a lobotomy\" and after \"read the dictionary.\" Now I\u0027m training for my first marathon -- the 2014 TCS New York City Marathon. Previously, my longest run of all time was somewhere around 3 miles.Managing Editor, BE On Custom Solutions, AOLPresumably, Chevron, vexed by such governmental interference, decided enough was enough. Cue the campaign cash machine. Turn on the pumps.Senior writer, Moyers \u0026 Company on public TV. Senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.It\u0027s a critical moment for the public to take another close look at this industry, which now has 13 percent of all U.S. college students and swallows more than a quarter of federal aid -- over $30 billion a year in taxpayer money. It\u0027s also a critical moment for President Obama to stand up for fiscal responsibility.Attorney, advocate, writer at RepublicReport.orgWe can\u0027t say it\u0027s hard. We can\u0027t cry over the pressure. We are supposed to grin and bear it. It\u0027s no wonder so many snap, so many are depressed, so many take this pent-up rage and resentment out on their kids. I\u0027m not saying it\u0027s right. I\u0027m saying I understand, carajo.Writer, educator, dreamer, bad assI love my country, the land I was born in, and the culture -- but if being patriotic means dying, then I am not patriotic.Teacher, photographerIt may be that no single race better exemplifies these developments, and foreshadows the shape of future federal elections, than Senator McConnell\u0027s competitive re-election contest against Alison Lundergan Grimes.Research Associate at the Brennan Center for JusticeDeputy Director, Brennan Center for Justice Democracy ProgramThe young people in Hong Kong can consider looking towards the bright side. The media landscape has been expanded and extended to allow for more voices due to the power of the Internet and social media. Hopeful indeed.Commentator and Journalism educatorThe times that are most challenging for us as parents -- the times when we must discipline our kids -- are the times we have the greatest ability to support and shape a child\u0027s growing brain.New York Times Bestselling Author, Neuropsychiatrist, Mindsight Educator, and Interpersonal NeurobiologistCo-author of \u0027The Whole-Brain Child\u0027I have worn Oscar de la Renta\u0027s signature fragrance, Oscar, my whole adult life, and I will stay forever devoted and will wear him to my grave. Gentle, soft, feminine, chic, elegant. His style. My scent. Words I attribute to us both.Actress and children\u0027s book authorI am deeply troubled by your sudden quietness in the midst of such powerful youth activism against police brutality and state violence. The killing of Mike Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, has awakened a movement, yet you are silent. Other members of the black entertainment industry have contributed in various ways, yet you are ghost.Chicago native. DC resident. Tulane University Alum. Passionate about social change and public policy.Maybe it\u0027s because I\u0027m British, but the idea of keeping calm and carrying on seems like a good one right now. Any concern should remain focused on West Africa, where the epidemic continues to spread.Medical doctor, epidemiologist and journalist; Staff writer at The Dallas Morning News; Professor of public health at The University of Texas at DallasMost of the rank-and-file conservatives with whom we might interact get their information from conservative media sources. Republican politicians are ensconced within it as well. Inside the walls of that closed environment, facts that do not jibe with conservative ideology or the conservative interpretation of events are twisted, turned on their head, or simply ignored.Author of \u0027Obama’s America: A Transformative Vision of Our National Identity\u0027Even on the difficult days, remember that you are never forgotten. Students who read this letter will think of you. They think of you all the time. We all will talk about the stories of teachers that we adored for decades. We will laugh, cry and appreciate. We carry what you taught us in our minds, and also in our hearts, for the rest of our lives.Writer, Marketing Co-op, and College Student.When a student walked past my brother and yelled the \"r-word\" (retard) at Kevin and his classmates, I knew I had to stand up for my brother. I avoided physical confrontation, but I used my most powerful weapon -- my voice.Student, member of Special Olympics\u0027 National Youth Activation CommitteeStudent, Special Olympics athlete, Unified Sports participantThe importance of a rigorous, normative approach to the implementation of primary health systems and the building of a cadre of trained public health professionals cannot be overstated. The industrialized countries have an obligation to assist with expertise, crisis management and funding.Under-Secretary General of the United Nations; Chair, UNITAIDNot one of the many specialists that I visited wanted to recognize that I was clearly struggling with an eating disorder. Eventually, when all else failed, I was diagnosed with \"runners\u0027 hematuria\" -- blood in the urine -- from running too many miles. \"It happens to marathoners all the time,\" one doctor said dismissively. \"It makes perfect sense.\"Leadership consultant, speaker and author, \u0027My Thinning Years: Starving the Gay Within\u0027Like the sound of a sonata, like Mozart, Einstein, and Whitman, you too will be gone someday. But like the abstract structure of a musical composition, the space-time coordinates and emergent patterns of your life are immortal, and your atomic and subatomic components will continue to exist in many and varied forms for trillions of years.Professor of natural sciences at Paul Smith\u0027s College, author of \"Your Atomic Self\" and \"Deep Future.\"It\u0027s hard to tell how much the far right, in its enduring hate for Obama, is seeing an opportunity in the Ebola hysteria, or the Ebola anxiety is feeding and re-igniting those racist and religious attacks on Obama from their heyday in \u002707-\u002710 when he was so unknown.Publisher of the visual politics and media literacy site, BagNewsNotesGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"SHOOTINGS ROCK OTTAWA",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
