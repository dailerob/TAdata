{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressThe bigger problem for Clinton is simply the fact that this isn\u0027t how this primary was supposed to go! And yet, after two contests Clinton\u0027s team is revealing a deep concern for the road ahead. Nevertheless, pointing to the way those party elites who enjoy voting privileges favor her over Sanders is not a move her campaign advisers should even be countenancing at this point. The basic argument of her candidacy is that the institutions that govern our lives do not need to be torn down, root and branch. For this reason, she shouldn\u0027t be telling voters that the system isn\u0027t really rigged against them while simultaneously telling her donors, \"Don\u0027t worry, the Democratic primary is rigged in my favor.\" But for whatever reason, that\u0027s where we are right now.Transforming movements towards social justice depend on the work of a core group of committed and persistent and not always frontline soldiers -- women and men who seize the moment and choose to stand up for what is right.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundI fear that the new voters who see Bernie Sanders as their savior are coming to view the rest of the Democratic party and those of us who have long worked to achieve it\u0027s goals as the enemy.Actress, founding member of MOMENTUMBernie Sanders is far too easy on Hillary Clinton in their debates. Clinton flaunts her record and experience in ways that Sanders could use to expose her serious vulnerabilities and disqualifications for becoming president.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorIt may be true that, as Hillary Clinton stated, \"One vote in 2002 is not a plan to defeat ISIS.\" But the real issue is whether or not Americans should entrust someone who helped facilitate the rise of ISIS with a plan to counter that threat.Author, \u0027Dangerous Ground\u0027The latest round of trash talking between GOP contenders Donald Trump and Jeb Bush has particularly focused on the other\u0027s mental health, if in an entirely juvenile sort of way. This, unfortunately, is the most common format in which mental health is referenced.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarWe are so committed to protecting Black masculinity and Black men. We rarely think about how vulnerable Black women and Black femininity are. Why are we more invested in protecting Black masculinity than we are in protecting ourselves from Black masculinity?Strategic partner and organizer with #BlackLivesMatterAssistant Professor of Women\u0027s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies at The Ohio State UniversityWhile the United States has been distracted by Russia and the Middle East, China is quietly considering putting its nuclear arsenal on high alert. That could spell trouble.Senior Writer, Union of Concerned ScientistsCelebration and distraction are not the same thing. Taking time to step back from our difficult realities to rejoice, heal and love together is crucial. Investing in corporate fantasies and confusing them with our movements is detrimental.Activist, artist, and youth workerThe secret for our national future in this troubled world is to be the west in the east and the east in the west. Comfortable and conversant with the multiple cultures of our region, and respectful of their diversity. Just as we are comfortable and engaged with the multicultural society we have become at home.Prime Minister of Australia (2007-2010)The Clintons are insiders now, their personal wealth of over $50 million derived nearly entirely from the wealthy and powerful. And it shows. Hillary\u0027s gradualism in health care carefully protects health-related industries. Her proposals for financial regulation do not include putting executives in jail, or confiscating the wealth they obtained by theft.What I keep hearing is that more than outright hostility, a huge piece of the white church\u0027s complicity in America\u0027s original sin comes down to indifference to others. Indifference to the experience and sufferings of their black neighbors and even black brothers and sisters in churches -- including indifference to those \"prophets who cry out.\"Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersThis week\u0027s KCRW podcast \"Scheer Intelligence\" features Truthdig editor and host Robert Scheer in conversation with Nomi Prins, author, journalist and former investment banker, who explains the culture of Wall Street and its influence on government.Editor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027They Know Everything About You\u0027We may take a child out of an army, but unless we do more for him -- help him re-enter society, enroll him in a good school, teach him a useful trade -- we have not set him free. Unless we are there to meet them with open arms, open homes and open schools, their wars will never end. And neither will ours.Academy Award-winning ActorThere have been many scientific highlights of physics and astronomy in recent years: the Higgs Boson, landing a probe on a comet, and an amazing fly-by of Pluto. But all this is dwarfed by what has been announced this week. A new era of science has begun.Astronomer; Director of the Dunlap Institute for Astronomy and AstrophysicsWhen Bernie Sanders denounces the control of big money over our politics and the unwarranted power of the millionaire and billionaire class, he\u0027s not just speaking truth to power, he\u0027s mobilizing the \"people with the pitchforks\" that Obama said early on he was protecting the bankers against.Professor, historian, authorHe\u0027s said to be a brilliant orator with a sharp legal mind. But his expression unsettles me. I realize my reaction is visceral and automatic, but as a neurologist it is my business to notice things out of the ordinary and probe them.NeurologistYesterday Charles Blow wrote a column in the Times headlined, \"Stop Bernie-Splaining to Black Voters,\" and it made me think about how the same arrogance is coming from straight supporters of both candidates to LGBT voters.Queer Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostThe U.S. plans on filling Eastern Europe with thousands of troops along with vehicles and weapons to equip an armored combat brigade. Uncle Sam may be bankrupt, but nothing is too expensive for our pampered European allies, who enjoy greater wealth while spending far less on the military.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteAll mothers who have lost their beloved children share the same pain and no matter what image or label the media, politicians or the powers that be assign, their lives will never be the sameSpokesperson, Parents Circle - Families Forum (PCFF)My grandparents were married for nearly 60 years before my grandmother passed away in 2008. After 26 years, it\u0027s safe to say I\u0027ve learned a lot about unconditional love from the couple I\u0027ve affectionately called \"Nanny and Pa.\"Deputy blog editor, The Huffington PostWhat role can artists play in not only addressing political issues, but also helping to resolve political problems? As provocateurs, can artists do more harm than good? Is all art inherently political — or are politics and art antithetical?Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogWhat type of south is Beyoncé trying to get us to see and hear? Are we still in the Beyhive or down in the fire ant pit? I\u0027d put money on the latter, and a lot of folks ain\u0027t comfortable with that. It\u0027s cool. \"Formation\" ain\u0027t for everybody.Scholar, Storyteller, Down South Georgia GirlI\u0027ve spent many a Valentine\u0027s Day alone, while utterly indulging myself in ways that thrilled and titillated and pleasured me.Award-winning actress and lifestyle expert, www.everydaylovelybylorraine.comThe gravitational disturbance that produced this history-making detection was apparently the result of two colliding black holes. That\u0027s not something you see every day. Yes, gravity waves are ubiquitous, but even the extremely sensitive instrumentation of LIGO is thoroughly unable to pick up these very local disturbances. It took a rare cosmic catastrophe to produce a space-time ripple large enough to be sensed.Senior Astronomer, SETI InstituteI became an ecologist because I love the living world. I resent greedy, threatening bullies who would take from wildlife their refuge and from the Paiutes and the rest of us our sacred grounds and our children\u0027s trust.Author and host, \u0027Saving the Ocean\u0027 on PBSThe debate over the health risks caused by the deadly fiber has long since ended, yet it remains legal and is still imported and used in a number of industries and products today.Ames Professor of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and System Chair of Thoracic Surgery at Mount Sinai Health SystemCo-founder, Asbestos Disease Awareness OrganizationAt the Democratic Primary debate in Wisconsin, there was not one single science question. Although there were a few vague references to the environment, neither of the candidates revealed any aspect of their science policy agendas. Think about that.Writer/director, \u0027The Ledge\u0027; Author, Trials of the Monkey\u0027; President, ScienceDebate.orgI am awake, alive and breathing fine. So nothing is wrong, right? That\u0027s the thing about anxiety disorders. We look fine. Of course, we look fine. That however, does not make it any less debilitating.Writer, singer, coffee addict. Changing the world one word at a time.I\u0027m an unashamed metalhead, but I want to talk about Phil Anselmo, racism and why I don\u0027t even touch any sort of metal community anymore. The problem isn\u0027t entirely the shitty joke. he problem is that a lot of his fans in particular, don\u0027t think it\u0027s a joke.Writer, nerd, weirdo,It\u0027s our choice -- fight for Bernie\u0027s brave new world, or waste our strength in an alliance with an ideology that is not only morally repugnant, but that is politically decrepit and eventually doomed to fail.PhD student at the University of CambridgeGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
