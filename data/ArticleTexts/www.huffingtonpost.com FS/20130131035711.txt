{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressIn the real world of actual human life and interaction, there are a lot of things to look forward to in the next four years. There are birthdays and graduations and some Olympics and a World Cup and a new Justin Timberlake album and a third season of Sherlock where we\u0027ll finally find out how (SPOILER) the titular character pulled off that staged suicide -- gads, it is just maddening! In the world of politics, however, there is only the 2016 election to look forward to and right now, Hillary Clinton is just ruining everything! She\u0027s all, \"Guys, I think I\u0027m just going to chillax for a while after being secretary of state,\" but this is so selfish because people are waiting for her to declare her intention to run for the White House and can brook no delay, according to Chris Cillizza.Read Post | Comments (206)Matthew Chapman, 01/30/13Writer, director, \"The Ledge\"I am pretty sure I can predict the outcome of the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on guns today. Reason will not prevail. Nowhere in America is anyone proposing a serious ban on weapons, yet gun lovers squeal in hysterical fear and frighten everyone else. It must be a form of Infantile Castration Anxiety.Read Post | Comments (1,471)Ari Melber, 01/30/13Attorney \u0026 Correspondent for The Nation magazineHere is one iron law of the Internet: a social network\u0027s emphasis on monetizing its product is directly proportional to its users\u0027 loss of privacy. Facebook\u0027s latest program, Graph Search, may be the company\u0027s largest privacy infraction ever.Read Post | Comments (59)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 01/29/13Author, research psychologist and gender scholarTo say that men are in irreversible decline based on snapshots is to say that those of us who grew up in the sixties would never tolerate another unnecessary war -- or come to realize that In A Gadda Da Vida was a really bad song.Read Post | Comments (877)Robert Reich, 01/30/13Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The stock market is bullish. The housing market seems to have rebounded a bit. So why are consumers so glum? Because they\u0027re deeply worried about their jobs and their incomes -- as they have every right to be.Read Post | Comments (628)Sec. Kathleen Sebelius, 01/30/13Secretary of Health and Human ServicesThis is an historic time for those Americans who never had health insurance, who had to go without insurance after losing a job or becoming sick, or who had been turned down because of a pre-existing condition.Read Post | Comments (53)Lorie Eber, 01/30/13EntrepreneurAt the risk of offending my fellow boomers, and in an effort to foster inter-generational harmony, I propose that we give up our senior discounts. It seems like the least we can do. After all, every time I get 20 percent off the cost of my hotel room, a Gen Yer is subsidizing me by paying a higher price.Read Post | Comments (634)Amb. Swanee Hunt, 01/30/13Lecturer in public policy at Harvard, former ambassador to AustriaThe legacy of Secretary Clinton will not be a dictator dead, air assault over Libya, or de-escalation in Gaza. Instead, like Nobel Peace Laureate George Marshall, she leaves behind a world more stable because she added women\u0027s force as indispensable to \"smart power.\"Read Post | CommentsJared Bernstein, 01/30/13Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorEconomists are well aware that slowing labor force growth is a factor in slower growth predictions in the future, but faster immigrant flows can improve that outlook. But what about the near term impact of immigrant competition in a job market that\u0027s already too weak?Read Post | Comments (39)Cara Lemieux, 01/29/13Single mom and blogger, Me and Ducky and Lifetime MomsOh wait -- did we all forget how most moms (referenced in these articles) become single moms? Right, at one point there was a man... and then there wasn\u0027t. But for some reason (which infuriates me), the headlines don\u0027t typically frame the story that way.Read Post | Comments (347)Marlo Thomas, 01/29/13Award-winning actress, author and activistWhen should you increase the weights in your workout routine?

Sorry folks. Your oily, burnt French and Italian roasts are the antithesis of what today\u0027s coffee should be.

The very best of those times. Forty years later, nothing has changed.Read Post | CommentsLois Alter Mark, 01/29/13Co-founder, StyleSubstanceSoul.com; Winner, BlogHer Voices of the Year \"People\u0027s Choice\" AwardGoing to a prostitute is like going to a restaurant. You choose what you want from the menu, you eat and you pay. With a surrogate, it\u0027s more like going to culinary school. You learn the recipes, you learn your way around the kitchen and then you go back to your life equipped with new skills.Read Post | Comments (94)Tim Ferriss, 01/30/13Author, \u0027The 4-Hour Workweek\u0027Brewing coffee beans is like cooking garlic. If you use bigger chunks of garlic, the taste is mild; if you put garlic through a press or finely dice it, the taste can be overwhelmingly powerful, even bitter. This is why chefs harp about cutting into uniform size. Coffee\u0027s no different.Read Post | Comments (62)Jeffrey Bland, Ph.D, 01/29/13President, Personalized Lifestyle Medicine InstituteWhen we talk about a healthy population, we need to remember that a very important focus needs to be on the health of our returning veterans.
