{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundA law requiring Levi Reed’s grandfather to store his gun safely might have saved Noah McGuire’s life. As Jodi reflected, “Storing your firearms responsibly with constant regard that there are children nearby -- if you have children in your home and you have firearms, then that needs to be on the forefront of your mind at all times.” Enough is enough. It is time for responsible parents everywhere to make sure everyone in their community stores their guns safely out of the reach of unsupervised children. And it is time for responsible citizens everywhere to stand up to the gun lobby and demand that politicians pass common sense gun safety and safe storage laws.Comments (343)Valerie JarrettSenior Advisor and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsIf you are willing to be flexible, you will find your true passion.

After all, what\u0027s more fun than gathering friends and family for a sunny, backyard picnic or a garden party under the stars? But I\u0027ve always found that a little bit of planning can take a perfectly nice meal outside to the next level.Comments (67)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarIf you believe the surveys -- and parse all they commentary they create -- successful working women must find balance, as they lean forward, peering up at the glass ceiling, looking over their shoulders at coming competitors in an environment that is not nearly as sisterly as we assumed.CommentsTim FerrissAuthor, \u0027The 4-Hour Workweek\u0027\"We\u0027ve all heard of acai, goji berries and chia seeds.

I was called terrible names that were quite hurtful. At that time, I had just realized that I\u0027m gay, and the bullies used the word \"gay\" as an insult. This made me feel like being gay was horrible.Comments (313)Olivia NuzziFreelance writer and studentAs in polling, you can get television numbers to tell you anything you want to hear. But even in that context, when ratings changes are as profound as MSNBC\u0027s, they tell a story that can be relied upon in terms of direction if not always in terms of exact degree.Comments (275)Rabbi Geoffrey A. MitelmanAssociate Rabbi, Temple Beth El of Northern WestchesterWhether it is the ocean, a sacred text, or another person\u0027s story, too often, we assume that all we need to know about something is what we see on the surface.CommentsGlennon MeltonBlogger, MomasteryThe work of a mother is repetitive. We fold the clothes, we wash the bowls, and we sing the same song and read the same bedtime story night after night. But that work is our prayerComments (11)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Economic forecasters exist to make astrologers look good. But the recent jubilance is enough to make even weather forecasters blush. \"Just look at the bull market! Look at home prices! Look at consumer confidence!\"Comments (294)Richard SteinerProfessor and conservation biologistTo unleash the same destructive, uncontrolled corporate determinism into the deep sea that has destroyed much of the land surface of our planet would be an historic mistake.CommentsRonna BenjaminManaging Editor/Boston www.betterafter50.comThough many of us 50 and over women are more accepting of our bodies than we have ever been, the act of bathing suit shopping still gets to us. Though we may be stoic, viewing our bodies in the soft lighting of our home bathrooms, before the full-length mirror under the harsh lights of a dressing room, even the best of us crumble.CommentsWilliam BaldwinActorThis shot over the bow of wrestling from the IOC could be the wakeup call we have been waiting for.
