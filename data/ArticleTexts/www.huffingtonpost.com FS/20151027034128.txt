Otherwise some of the worst tyrants in history would be considered great leaders. They weren\u0027t leaders; they were demagogues. There\u0027s a difference. A leader brings out the best in his followers. A demagogue brings out the worst. Leaders empower the powerless; they give them voice and respect. Demagogues scapegoat the powerless; they use scapegoating as a means to fortify their power. America is the only democracy in the world where anyone can declare himself or herself a candidate for the presidency -- and, armed with enough money, possibly even win. Which makes it all the more important that we distinguish leaders from demagogues. The former ennoble our society. The latter degrade and endanger it -- even if they lose.When I look back on the great teachers who shaped my life, what I remember isn\u0027t the way they prepared me to take a standardized test. What I remember is the way they taught me to believe in myself. To be curious about the world.44th President of the United StatesUnless reporters give Ryan a pop quiz, they really don\u0027t know what he knows about the budget, but they do know what he says. In addition to wanting to privatize both Social Security and Medicare, Ryan has indicated that he essentially wants to shut down the federal government.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027The rue des Martyrs is all about sharing, and I bonded with its merchants, artisans, and residents. Paris finally felt like home. And thanks to this street of magic, anyone can feel at home here.Author, \"The Only Street in Paris: Life on the Rue des Martyrs\"Ben Carson\u0027s rise is hard to explain. He\u0027s now leading the polls in Iowa, and while he\u0027s still trailing Trump nationally, he is slowly catching up (a claim absolutely none of the other GOP candidates can make). Carson is, in some ways, the anti-Trump.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comAs the world enters the Third Industrial Revolution, increased connectivity between businesses and prosumers, powered by clean and renewable energies, will change the global economy. Here\u0027s how we can make that happen.Author, \u0027The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of Things, the Collaborative Commons, and the Eclipse of Capitalism\u0027We must not protect ourselves from disagreement; we must be open to being offended for the sake of learning, and we must be ready to give offense so as to create new opportunities for thinking.President, Wesleyan UniversityTomorrow, the European Parliament will vote on a proposal that will decide the future of the open Internet in Europe. The proposal is supposed to protect net neutrality, the principle that keeps the Internet an open and free platform, but it contains dangerous loopholes that threaten the future of free speech, innovation and democracy in Europe.Law professor, activist, candidate in the Democratic Primary for PresidentProfessor, Stanford Law School; Director, Stanford Center for Internet and SocietyUnfortunately, just as we learn more about sleep\u0027s role in our health, we are also learning that we\u0027re not getting enough. More than one-third of adults report daytime sleepiness for 15 days or more each month that gets in the way of work, driving and spending time with friends or family.Secretary of Health \u0026 Human Services (HHS)It\u0027s shocking (and not entirely surprising) that as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, voting rights of African-Americans are being taken away by right-wing state governments, using the very techniques that the 1965 Act prohibited -- techniques that were legalized after the fact by a partisan Supreme Court.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Today, regardless of lessons learned over the years, it is important that every young person understand that Hillary Clinton is one of the most important global voices on LGBT human rights in our time.President, Elizabeth Birch Company/Global OutI can see Biden\u0027s point about solving the nation\u0027s problems: If you\u0027re working toward solutions, why call an advocate of a policy you oppose your \"enemy,\" when \"my good friend across the aisle\" will do? My reservation is that speaking well of the other party can drain genuinely moral disputes of authentic moral authority.USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorIsrael\u0027s Prime Minister attributing the Holocaust to Palestinian influence over Hitler is a \"Blood Libel\" level lie.Editor, Tikkun MagazineI\u0027m so proud to have stood at April\u0027s side this Saturday with our daughter and before more than a hundred of our nearest and dearest friends and family to at long last celebrate the legal recognition of our love.Plaintiff in Miller v. Davis; Retired special education teacherToday I am proud to stand with Senator Bernie Sanders and hundreds of Verizon Workers at a Wireless retail store in Manhattan as 39,000 CWA and IBEW members battle for their contract and the organizing and bargaining rights of Verizon Wireless workers.past president, Communications Workers of America,\u0027What should I do next if I want the world to be a better place?\u0027 That\u0027s my favorite question to get, because it\u0027s the one I tried to answer with my book. I want kids to learn about the world around them and then decide what makes them angry or curious or inspired.Vice Chair, Clinton FoundationOn Wednesday, the wide field of Republican candidates vying to become the 45th president will arrive in Boulder, Colorado for a debate on the economy. But the health of our economy is inextricably linked to our environment.41st Governor of Colorado; Director of the Center for the New Energy Economy at Colorado State UniversityThis is a fight about what happens in the future, not the present. By implying otherwise, the president\u0027s opponents are playing politics with defense, the precise thing they have (wrongly) charged the administration with doing.Director, Arms and Security Project, Center for International PolicyWhat has taken Clinton and Trump decades and billions of dollars in name recognition to accomplish, Bernie Sanders has done with grass roots organizing and fundraising. He is the only electable Democrat for president.Columnist published in The Cleveland Plain Dealer, The Baltimore Sun, The Hill, Salon, The Jerusalem Post www.hagoodman.comWhat Sanders exposed is a simple truth: Clinton, in an interview on Rachel Maddow last week, revised the history of her husband and the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA).Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostWe are sharing nutritious, easy-to-prepare meals with the public through social media. Home-based cooks, students and adults and professional and celebrity chefs are invited to film themselves preparing an easy-to-prepare meal that is plant-based.Board-certified radiologist; Board member, Lesscancer; Author, \u0027A World Without Cancer\u0027I have no issue with Benghazi being investigated; all the better to prevent future attacks. It is also understandable to be outraged at the deaths in Benghazi. But not if you felt no such outrage when embassy staff was killed under Bush. Or if you give Bush a pass on 9/11.Scientist and former White House Senior Policy Analyst; Ph.D. in marine biology/neurophysiologyThe primary debates are a great venue for these discussions, but the past two debates have instead been dominated by ideological rants about immigration and Planned Parenthood.Vice President of Policy and Research, Center for American Progress Action FundThe black dad that you don\u0027t think exists is nurturing. He is soft. He is kind. Gentle. Thoughtful. Hardworking. Dedicated. Creative. Sleep-deprived. Caring. Devoted. Well-informed. Present. The black dad that you don\u0027t think exists does. And he is not an anomaly.Writer based in PhiladelphiaThese fertility programs work, and the inertia to keep doing things the same old way must end. How many more scandals and reports can this agency endure before it brings fundamental change to this program?President and CEO, The Humane Society of the United StatesThe perceived personality battle of the two Hillarys may be more real that many of us would like to believe. It is indicative of the leadership corner many female officials get painted into--in order to succeed politically women are forced to take-on masculine characteristics to survive in the political battlefield.Talented communicator, master problem solver \u0026 systems builder, leadership sage, courageous guide, balance creator and part-time goddessThere is, of course, a certain logic to imagining that the increasing global sweep of these deployments is a sign of success. After all, why would you expand your operations into ever-more nations if they weren\u0027t successful?Managing Editor, TomDispatch.comAs anti-Muslim sentiment continues to be an accepted part of our political discourse, and Islamophobia continues to rise, we are undermining the core values of our constitution and our founding principles. Continued silence and acceptance of our political candidates engaging in such vitriol is both racist and un-American.Professor of Political ScienceAs Vice President Joe Biden announced his decision last week not to run for president, he talked about dreams denied, possibilities foreclosed. He wasn\u0027t speaking of his own aspirations, though.International President, United SteelworkersRather than bask in Trudeau\u0027s afterglow, many Canadians are offended by the international swoon. The basic argument is that since women know the horrors of objectification, why would we inflict the same treatment on men? But the \"same treatment\" has a very different effect.Blogs Editor, Huffington PostThank you for reminding me who I really am. I thought we were now beyond ethnic identities. But apparently not.
