{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, Americans fulfilled part of our responsibility to our government by filing taxes. But the government isn\u0027t doing its part in return. First, as a new report by the National Taxpayer Advocate showed, the IRS has been crippled by years of budget cuts, resulting in a \"devastating erosion of taxpayer service\" and filing misery for millions. Hold times, which were under three minutes in 2004, are now over 30 minutes. This isn\u0027t smaller government; it\u0027s broken government, which, for many budget-slashing legislators, is the point. In more news from dysfunctional D.C., Attorney General-Designate Loretta Lynch remains in limbo, her nomination held hostage by Senate Republicans for over five months. On Friday, a clearly frustrated President Obama demanded, \"Call Loretta Lynch for a vote...This is embarrassing.\" Meanwhile, the bigger \"news\" was the breathless scoop of Hillary Clinton eating at Chipotle. She had, we were told, a chicken burrito bowl (with guacamole). If only our political system -- and media coverage -- were as satisfying.At first, I leaned toward keeping our kids vaccine-free. I thought the concern about vaccination made sense. But after hearing both sides of the argument, I decided facts were my friends. I couldn\u0027t rely on word-of-mouth, friend-of-a-friend information. It was going to require actual research from vetted sources; I wanted the truth.Mother, ActressIn the United States, African Americans are far more likely to be arrested for selling or possessing drugs, even though studies have shown that African Americans and whites use drugs at the same rate, and whites are actually more likely to sell drugs.U.S. Senator for New JerseyRacism, homophobia, the refusal to regard women as equals -- these beliefs will only end if we keep talking about why and how they\u0027re problematic, and force those who hold them to own them -- and face the consequences.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarIt was back to the edit room to update yet again a video that is heartbreakingly more relevant than ever. We can only pray that it will never need another revision. Sadly, we\u0027re pretty damn sure it will.Co-host, The HuffPost ShowCo-host, The HuffPost ShowHillary Clinton\u0027s campaign announcement is an insult to the presidency. It represents a total capitulation to the political consulting business -- two-and-a-half minutes of marketing images, without anything resembling serious argument.Professor of law and political science, Yale; Author \u0027The Decline and Fall of the American Republic\u0027We need to create a society where girls and women are getting the same encouragement and support to build their careers as the boys and men are. From the start. That\u0027s just my #78cents.Actor, \u0027OITNB\u0027 \u0026 \u0027HTGAWM\u0027On opening day, rejoice that the fundamentals that America\u0027s pastime and American democracy share -- character, support, versatility, endurance and diversity -- strengthen and enrich us all. In that spirit, play ball!Chair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusThis move truly designates Chile as a global leader in marine conservation. Chile has passed effective fishery regulations in the past -- like implementing science-based fishing quotas -- but a ban of this scale marks a truly historic move. Hopefully, other nations will soon follow Chile\u0027s footsteps, prohibiting bottom trawls around sensitive habitat.Actor; board member, OceanaActor; board member, OceanaGoogle has committed so many abuses, over so many years, that it has hard to know where the European Commission should start. And, I believe, once the filing of complaints and litigation start, there will be additional complaints.Professor of Operations and Information Management at The Wharton SchoolHotels are making a killing. Occupancy rates are exceeding pre-recession highs, and are expected to reach record levels in 2016. But the little-known trade association representing this robust $163 billion dollar industry is a major force fighting behind the scenes on Capitol Hill and in statehouses and courtrooms across the country to keep workers wages low.The Center for Media and Democracy/ALEC ExposedWe are a long way from justice and this case will have to work its way through the prosecutor, jury selection and trial, but just the contrast of this tragic incident and that of Garner\u0027s death and others is remarkable.President, National Action Network\"Right now, if I want to find out what\u0027s going on in Ukraine or Syria or Washington, I read the New York Times, other national newspapers, I look at the Associated Press wires, I read the British press, and so on. I use Google all the time, I\u0027m happy it\u0027s there. But just as when I read the New York Times or the Washington Post, or the Wall Street Journal knowing that they have ways of selecting and shaping the material that reaches you, you have to compensate for it.\"CEO of BylineIn a nation where millions of working families still can\u0027t earn enough to pay rent, pay the bills, and put food on the table at the same time -- and where in fiscal year 2013 there were 4.9 million households with no income but SNAP, including 1.3 million households with children -- relying on the charity of PB and J Day is not a substitute for justice.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundI have noticed how often I -- and my female friends -- apologize for things that are out of our control. This, of course, is different than saying, \"I am sorry for being late,\" or \"I\u0027m sorry I picked a fight last night because I was really hungry and you were taking forever to figure out our plans.\"Senior Editor, Los AngelesWhen we have complicated trade agreements that could put thousands of U.S. workers on the unemployment line and hamper this nation\u0027s economy, shouldn\u0027t our elected officials have a chance to review and make changes to them? After all, lawmakers have certainly spent significant time considering more frivolous matters in recent years.General President, International Brotherhood of TeamstersYou can load up your diet with foods that have been shown to fight inflammation, specifically plant-based foods containing bioactive compounds that help turn down the immune response.Registered dietitian; Co-author, \u0027The Real Skinny: Appetite for Health’s 101 Fat Habits \u0026 Slim Solutions\u0027She is by far the most qualified and trustworthy person to protect our national security interests and to create a better American future. Hillary stood with us, as she has stood with so many over the years, and we are proud to stand with her for our country now.Retired AmbassadorCEO, JC Wilson International VenturesIt\u0027s been three years since the divorce, but it occurred to me this morning that I had something I needed to tell my ex-husband. And it\u0027s only this: there were nice times too.Mother, Writer, Student. Sometimes funny fat girl at parties.Don\u0027t hold your breath, but future historians may look back on 2015 as the year that the renewable energy ascendancy began, the moment when the world started to move decisively away from its reliance on fossil fuels.Author and Professor of Peace and World-Security Studies, Hampshire CollegeIf we are going to ask our students to work hard and achieve the American Dream, we must do our part to ensure that they have the resources they need. We can start by investing in our schools.U.S. Representative for California\u0027s 27th DistrictThe period has usurped the role of transforming a sentiment into something weightier -- something more emphasized. Which isn’t to say that exclamations are endangered. In fact, they’re cropping up everywhere.Books Editor, The Huffington PostSleep problems can set teens up for increased risk of substance use and abuse and the dangerous behaviors associated with alcohol and drugs. Poor and insufficient sleep also makes teens more likely to experience other health problems.Clinical Psychologist; Board Certified Sleep SpecialistWhy was Abraham Lincoln murdered? The popular understanding of his character makes the question surprisingly hard to answer. We have been taught to regard Lincoln as a clear-headed statesman, an exemplar of the spirit of reconciliation.Professor of Literature, Yale UniversityWe are careful to trust not in words alone, but in actions that are fully transparent. The Framework Agreement, with its unprecedented provisions for verification, relies more on transparency than trust and offers the best path to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear-armed state.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersThe GOP have gotten used to a FOX softball press that offers them a national stage to say whatever they want with no push-back. If the little resistance to their BS we\u0027ve seen in the last few weeks is any indication of what\u0027s to come, it should make for an entertaining campaign season.Richard Zombeck is a freelance writer for hire and a contributor to www.nowitcounts.comI care about who you are, how we relate to one another, and what motivates you. I care about what matters, and I really don\u0027t care about the rest.Writer, Recovery AdvocateI continue to worry about what I have referred to in past posts as \"the age of insanity.\" Recently I met with R.H. Flutes, my old friend from the Lying Institute of America. Dr. R.H. Flutes was in a jubilant mood because his former student, Ted Cruz, was on the presidential campaign trail.Academy Award-winning director, screenwriter and producerIn late February, Sen. Barbara Boxer, Sen. Ed Markey, and I sent a letter to 100 organizations affiliated with the fossil fuel industry asking whether they spent money to support climate research. That letter provoked a torrent of criticism from conservative groups and publications mischaracterizing our motives and muddling our message. I\u0027d like to set the record straight.Democratic Senator from Rhode IslandAfter a quarter century at the apex of American government, Hillary is an unlikely champion of the fundamental changes we need. But she is brilliant and resilient. It\u0027s clear that the argument posed by Elizabeth Warren has already concentrated her mind. She\u0027ll lead the charge only if populist movements and upheavals make her do it.President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureRaises would, of course, cost these billion-dollar corporations something. More costly, though, is the price paid by minimum-wage workers who have not received a raise in six years. Even more dear is what these workers have paid for their campaign to get raises. Managers have harassed, threatened and fired them.International President, United SteelworkersGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"THE BATTLE BEGINS",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
