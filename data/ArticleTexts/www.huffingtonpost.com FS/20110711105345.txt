{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Throughout my life, I\u0027ve had the good fortune to have a group of very close and supportive female friends. They have been a real blessing. So when I saw an early screening of the new film, Snow Flower and the Secret Fan, I was deeply moved by the passionate way it evokes the power of female friendship. The film chronicles the friendship of two girls in 19th-century China, and the bond between two of their descendants in present day Shanghai. But the story is universal. One scene, depicting the cruel tradition of bound feet, caused me to make my own time-shift jump to the present: thinking about what modern women are inflicting on our feet in the form of wearing impossibly high heels.

They play more to emotion than reason. But they\u0027re disturbingly predictable, especially when they come after the death of a child. The push for \"Caylee\u0027s Law\" needs a douse of cold water.Read Post | CommentsAdam Hanft, 7/11/11Political Columnist, CEO of Hanft UnlimitedThere\u0027s something puzzling about a president who wrote a book called The Audacity of Hope becoming the Privatizer-In-Chief, turning much of the space program over to for-profit companies.Read Post | CommentsMarty Kaplan, 7/11/11Director, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolPeople who voted for Obama can banish their blues by believing that he actually has an awesome super-secret strategy going on.

Because in an age of information what is unquestionably true is that control of that information is extremely unequal -- and that inequality drives broader economic inequality in our economy.Read Post | CommentsDean Baker, 7/11/11Co-Director of the Center for Economic and Policy ResearchThe Washington press corps is living some bizarre delusion about the balanced budgets at the end of the Clinton years. They didn\u0027t come about from politicians making tough choices. They came about from much stronger than expected economic growth.Read Post | CommentsDaphne Eviatar, 7/11/11Senior Associate, Human Rights First’s Law and Security ProgramAccording to Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY), the Casey Anthony verdict is precisely why the U.S. should no longer be allowed to bring suspected terrorists to trial in its civilian federal courts: because juries cannot be trusted to convict in all cases.Read Post | CommentsBrian Frederick, 7/11/11Executive Director, SportsFans.orgForget the Super Bowl.

Abromowitz, 7/9/11Senior Fellow at the Center for American ProgressThe choices being made today by leaders in Washington will determine if the titanic U.S. economy stays afloat or sinks further underwater.
