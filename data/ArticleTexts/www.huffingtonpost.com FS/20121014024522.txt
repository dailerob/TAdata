In Obama\u0027s case, the largest fantasy was perhaps this: that you can fight for a cause and win without fighting against anything.

The plaintive undertone that you hear sometimes, under his heartiest shout, really says to his listeners \"How can anyone reject what I\u0027m saying? This is so reasonable.

James Martin, S.J., 10/12/12Catholic priest and author, \u0027The Jesuit Guide to (Almost) Everything\u0027When a Catholic candidate speaks about his or her faith, it\u0027s more important for voters to concentrate on their policies, rather than trying to worm their way into the person\u0027s soul.Read Post | Comments (347)Richard Reeves, 10/12/12Former Deputy Director of Strategy to the UK GovernmentThe debates over social mobility will rage between and within the main political parties. But they should do so on firmer ground. The nuts and bolts of congressional and government machinery make poor copy for soaring campaign speeches.

Amanda Todd\u0027s story brought back painful memories of my own experience with bullying, years of misery that nag at me even today. I didn\u0027t have any elementary school friends, so I got manipulated easily. Kids would pretend to be my friends, gain my trust, then relay embarrassing facts about my personal life to the rest of the school. My mistake was responding.Read Post | Comments (30)Arianna Huffington, 10/12/12From Afghanistan, Josh Hersh puts the spotlight in Huffington magazine this week on the war efforts we rarely hear about -- the \"hearts and minds\" development projects.
