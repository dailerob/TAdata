{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressHey, America! Are you ready for some high-level presidential scandals? No, no, calm down. I have none to report. But what\u0027s being reported is that one day -- maybe someday soon! -- there will be a scandal to report, and this can be totally proven with mathematics. So, should a scandal blossom, it\u0027s now been predicted. If one fails to materialize, well, that just means there\u0027s one around the corner.

In contrast, the U.S. got its man, but demonstrated that it still hasn\u0027t grown out of its comic-book phase.Read Post | CommentsDavid Katz, M.D., 05.31.2011Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterDr. Joel Moskowitz, director of the Center for Family and Community Health a UC Berkeley, answers my questions about the talking we all increasingly do, and offers advice on how best to take stock, and control, of the risks involved.Read Post | CommentsAlan Alda, 05.31.2011Actor, writer, directorIt may seem frivolous to talk about loving Marie Curie, as though I insist on seeing her in a personal way. But for those of us who are not scientists, yet hunger to understand science more deeply, the personal, the human, is our doorway.Read Post | CommentsArianna Huffington, 05.30.2011This weekend, I learned of squirrels whose behavior offers scientific proof of the evolutionary basis of altruism. It was a lesson especially worth remembering on a weekend devoted to recalling the sacrifice of those who have given their lives in defense of ours.Read Post | CommentsDavid A. Cleveland, 05.31.2011Professor, Environmental Studies Program at UCSBWhile localization is a necessary strategy with great potential, it is not sufficient. In addition, there is also a danger that it can obscure the real goals or even replace them, luring us into the \"local trap.\"Read Post | CommentsKathryn M. Ireland, 05.31.2011Finally the show is here! Million Dollar Decorators... if only I had taken Margaret Russell\u0027s advice and insisted on hair and makeup, not to mention losing 15 pounds before the show was taped instead of after, I would have no negative comments.Read Post | CommentsBryce Covert, 05.31.2011Assistant Editor, New Deal 2.0Credit scores are becoming more and more important, but who is in charge of these scores and how are they determined? The answer isn\u0027t easy to come by.Read Post | CommentsDean Baker, 05.31.2011Co-Director of the Center for Economic and Policy ResearchA crucial question that the public should be asking the pundits and press is: how often does Alan Simpson have to be wrong, and how far from the mark does he have to go, before he loses credibility?Read Post | CommentsAmitai Etzioni, 05.31.2011GWU ProfessorTrue, mentally ill patients vary in their capacities, which hopefully can be made to grow. But protecting life takes precedent over respecting a will that is not free but distorted by mental and often genetic, chemical or other malfunctions.Read Post | CommentsMichael Shaw, 05.31.2011Publisher of the visual politics and photojournalism site, BagNewsNotesInstead of glamorizing Sarah Palin with Cover Girl photos, what if the media published photos of Team Palin as the flimflam they really are?Read Post | CommentsDavid Bromwich, 05.30.2011Professor of Literature at YaleThe tone of the present administration is more soothing than that of its predecessor. But ever since Obama gave his National Archives Speech, in May 2009, the continuities with Cheney-Bush have been unmistakable.Read Post | CommentsLouis Licari, 05.31.2011Beauty expert, Contributing Editor, \u0027Today Show\u0027Hair should looked controlled but never done. This might seem to be an impossible challenge in the heat and humidity, but the solution is simple: Styles that incorporate the natural texture of your hair work best.Read Post | CommentsJudith Orloff MD, 05.31.2011Author, \u0027Emotional Freedom: Liberate Yourself from Negative Emotions and Transform Your Life\u0027Recognizing that you\u0027re a gusher enables you to become a better communicator by learning to balance self-sufficiency with emotional expression.Read Post | CommentsAaron Marquez, 05.31.2011Co-Founder of ServeNext.orgDespite the vision for a Veterans Corps, we have not moved aggressively enough to develop these types of programs. The primary challenge has been the uncertainty of Americorps funding.Read Post | CommentsGen. Wesley Clark, 05.31.2011General, U.S. ArmyRic Sanchez will be a different kind of senator. He served under me in the Army, and rarely have I served with a more competent, intelligent, and morally courageous man.Read Post | CommentsCarl Safina, 05.31.2011MacArthur fellow, Pew fellow, and Guggenheim fellowOne of the weaknesses of the Endangered Species Act is that it sets a floor -- preventing total extinction -- rather than setting a standard of abundant populations. The bluefin is on a path to endangerment. And so we wait.Read Post | CommentsTom Engelhardt, 05.31.2011Editor of TomDispatch.comIs the Libyan war legal? Was bin Laden\u0027s killing legal? Were those \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" legal? These questions are irrelevant. In terms of \"foreign policy,\" and \"national security,\" the U.S. is now a post-legal society.Read Post | CommentsG. Roger Denson, 05.31.2011Critic, essayist and cultural nomadEminently lyrical and rapturous in the cinematic manifold that it kaleidoscopically brings into and out of focus onscreen with each turn of the Terrence Malick lens, Tree of Life is one of those singular cinematic milestones.Read Post | CommentsSam Harris, 05.30.2011Author, NeuroscientistThe concept of free will is a non-starter, both philosophically and scientifically.
