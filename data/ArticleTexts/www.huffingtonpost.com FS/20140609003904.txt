It\u0027s not rocket science. Sgt. Bergdahl was never a living, breathing human to these people -- just what the director Alfred Hitchcock would have called a \"MacGuffin.\"Author, \u0027Tear Down This Myth\u0027This week\u0027s announcement by the Obama administration to reduce our nation\u0027s global warming pollution from power plants is the most important step taken to combat the climate crisis in our country\u0027s history.Chairman, Generation Investment Management and The Climate Reality ProjectHow can I raise my boys into men who will never, ever touch someone when they are not wanted?

I\u0027d love for those boycotting to be lions that roar at Brunei, not little mice that squeak at a hotel chain.Actress; Director of this year\u0027s Sundance selected short film \u0027Dawn\u0027The largest prison education program in California is thriving at Ironwood State Prison, where men are transcribing college textbooks into Braille, learning trade skills and where an astonishing 1200 students have earned college degrees.Executive Producer of The Hangover film franchise, founder of The Anti-Recidivism Coalition (ARC)The dangers from human-induced climate change are real and the climate science is sound.

Even for a day.Writer-Director, How To Make Money Selling DrugsWriter-Director, How To Make Money Selling DrugsI firmly believe there must be swift and certain consequences for all crime, but I also believe that the way our system deals with low-level, nonviolent and non-serious offenders wastes resources needed to fight more serious crime.California Attorney General and author of Smart on CrimeAs much as I had longed for an apology from my father for all of those years, I had never really thought it was possible.
