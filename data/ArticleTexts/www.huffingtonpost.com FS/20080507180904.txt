{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOAfter his loss in Pennsylvania, Obama faced gale force political winds. The media had turned. Hillary was on the attack. Rev. Wright threw himself into the center of the debate. But in spite of it all, he won an overwhelming victory in the tenth largest state. All that counts now is how many delegates each remaining primary contributes to achieving Barack\u0027s magic number -- the 2025 delegates he needs to clinch the nomination. Barack will most likely lose West Virginia and Kentucky, but each one will contribute more delegates to the final number he needs.Read Post | CommentsBIOLawrence O\u0027Donnell, 05.07.2008A senior campaign official and Clinton confidante has told me that there will be a Democratic nominee by June 15. He could not bring himself to say the words \"Hillary will drop out by June 15,\" but that is clearly what he meant.Read Post | Comments (80)BIORJ Eskow, 05.07.2008Before today\u0027s primaries she had already lost the nomination process according to any objective measure not invented by her own campaign. It\u0027s still over. She\u0027s still through.Read Post | Comments (194)BIODylan Loewe, 05.07.2008What is unclear is whether Hillary can possibly move the race forward. Whatever path to the nomination she once envisioned has entirely evaporated, a reality not lost on the remaining superdelegates.Read Post | Comments (134)BIOArianna Huffington, 05.06.2008The way the McCain camp has reacted to my revelation about his not voting for Bush in 2000 is further confirmation that he is now willing to say or do anything, or sling mud at anyone, to satisfy his hunger for the White House.Read Post | Comments (331)BIOIan Welsh, 05.07.2008To be crass and point out the unpalatable truth, there isn\u0027t a lot in it for Hillary to back Obama in a more than pro-forma \"going through the motions\" fashion.Read Post | Comments (319)BIOCenk Uygur, 05.07.2008Hillary has deluded people into thinking her chances of winning the nomination were improving as they were getting dramatically worse.Read Post | Comments (69)BIOJason Linkins, 05.07.2008With the media stating explicit demands, and practically begging Obama to just let them give him a news-cycle win, Obama finally sucked it up and gave in last night, during his speech in North Carolina.Read Post | Comments (26)BIOBob Cesca, 05.06.2008Obama pushed through and managed to reclaim momentum against the most popular Democratic brand in the world. And now, he\u0027s going to be widely regarded as the presumptive nominee.Read Post | Comments (249)BIOLee Camp, 05.07.2008Read Post | CommentsBIODavid Bromwich, 05.07.2008This was perhaps the most opaque, elaborately qualified, antiseptically cleansed and institutionally begged-off story ever published by a major newspaper anywhere.Read Post | Comments (28)BIOTom Hayden, 05.06.2008Hillary needed two wins. She failed utterly. But she will not stop, not on her own. The superdelegates should intervene tomorrow to send Hillary a message. Out now.Read Post | Comments (72)BIOArt Levine, 05.06.2008The Election Protection coalition is already reporting disturbing accounts from the Indiana and North Carolina primaries. All these obstacles undermine fair and accurate voting in both states.Read Post | Comments (98)Robert Scheer, 05.07.2008Errol Morris, 05.06.2008Matt Littman, 05.06.2008Chris Kelly, 05.06.2008Keli Goff, 05.06.2008Lawrence O\u0027Donnell, 05.05.2008Harry Shearer, 05.06.2008Ari Melber, 05.06.2008Joseph A.
