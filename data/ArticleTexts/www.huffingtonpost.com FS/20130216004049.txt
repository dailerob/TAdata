And for much of that time -- as with any long-sought dream -- the fantasy never quite lived up to the reality. All of that arguably changed in 2008, when Hillary Clinton came within arm\u0027s reach of the Democratic nomination for the presidency.Read Post | Comments (73)Al Gore, 02/14/13Chairman, Generation Investment Management and The Climate Reality ProjectA new study by the National Cancer Institute of the National Institute of Medicine reveals that the Tea Party Movement was planned over a decade ago by groups with ties to the tobacco and fossil fuel industries.Read Post | Comments (766)Peter Diamandis, 02/15/13Chairman/CEO, X PRIZE FoundationToday scientists are closely tracking 434 asteroids that are large enough and come close enough to the Earth to be of potential future concern, and while none of these pose any significant risk today, increased surveillance is required.Read Post | Comments (12)Jill Di Donato, 02/15/13Writer, Adjunct Professor of English, The Fashion Institute of Technology, New YorkTaboos change with the times.
