{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Russell SimmonsFounder, GlobalGrind.comFor 42 years, we have waged war against our own people that we have disguised as the \"War on Drugs.\" Forty-two years of failure that has cost the American taxpayers $1 trillion dollars, resulted in 45 million drug arrests, and overfilled America\u0027s prisons while failing to reduce the availability, sale, or use of drugs in the United States. Instead, it destroyed the fabric of communities of color, where diseased, innocent people in need of drug rehabilitation were trained in violent criminal behavior and became lifetime consumers of the prison industrial complex. All the while, it led America to become the world\u0027s leading jailer, with 2.3 million of our citizens behind bars, more than any country on earth. Tomorrow, we will begin a \"cyber march\" on Washington to stop this five-decade-long misery and devastation of humanity, that has resulted in one in every 15 African-American men in prison.Comments (136)Peter Alexander MeyersAuthor, professor, political theoristThe most important instrument we have for formulating and controlling everyday action -- our imagination -- has been off-loaded to screens and boxes with industrial abandon. This is the underpinning of our cinematic culture and it sustains the abuse of guns.Comments (427)Megan PillowWriterWhen the nurses took Atticus to the nursery a few hours after his birth because his temperature was low, it didn\u0027t occur to me to be afraid. Even when a nurse entered the room with a doctor who introduced herself as a neonatologist, it didn\u0027t trigger an alarm.Comments (89)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027With the sequester, America has adopted austerity economics. Yet austerity economics is the wrong medicine at exactly the wrong time. Look what it\u0027s done to Europe.Comments (31)Keli GoffAuthor and political correspondent, TheRoot.comThe question is this: What is our responsibility as women when it comes to supporting, celebrating or critiquing trailblazing women whom we may not agree with, like or respect.CommentsTom Zeller Jr.Senior Writer, The Huffington PostIf TransCanada felt it had weathered the worst of a five-year battle with environmentalists and other critics of the Keystone XL pipeline project, events of the last week or so will have curbed their enthusiasm.CommentsEugene JareckiAward-winning dramatic and documentary filmmakerI\u0027m not naive. I know what bureaucratic thrust drives the war on drugs and what an obstacle this represents. Yet still, everywhere I look, I also see the writing on the wall. Everyday, a growing number of states moves closer to legalizing marijuana as Colorado and Washington did on Election Day.Comments (42)Robert RedfordActor, director and environmental activistTar sands expansion rewards the oil industry while putting us all at risk of oil spills and climate change. That\u0027s a raw deal by any calculation.Comments (44)Maureen RyanTV critic, The Huffington PostMore than ever, it feels as though we\u0027re supposed to \"solve\" \"Mad Men\" episodes these days; each meaning, symbol, allegory and metaphor is as neatly arranged as a Japanese bento box, one we are supposed to unpack with proper care and reverence.Comments (388)Sorab ShroffProduct Manager at AOLMargaret Thatcher is despised by many left-leaning Britons. However, how many of our former prime ministers are loved? We British have a need to take down uppity people. Margaret Thatcher, however, was something special.Comments (95)Howard Steven FriedmanStatistician and health economist for the United Nations; Teacher, Columbia UniversityWith Rutgers University\u0027s Mike Rice video and subsequent firing now in the news, many are tempted to talk about the special treatment given to sports. This conversation makes me wonder, which special treatment are they talking about?CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorIf we wanted to target the persistent slack in the labor market, though I can\u0027t see any signs that we do, we shouldn\u0027t just target the unemployment rate; we should also go after the underemployment rate.CommentsDavid WestinAuthor, \u0027Exit Interview\u0027; Former President, ABC NewsAt a time when there is so much bickering and self-doubt on this side of the Atlantic, it\u0027s good to remember how much difference a leader can make.CommentsJanet TobiasDirector/ Producer/ Co-WriterNo Place On Earth let the group of us who made the film -- our film family -- touch, taste and in very low light see the the power of the human spirit, the power of family, friendship, and a village underground.CommentsDean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027The costs of protectionism can be large, as economists frequently point out when discussing 20 percent tariffs in steel. For some reason they become strangely silent when it comes to patent protection that raise the price of drugs by 1,000 percent.CommentsMichael NovakDistinguished visiting professor, Ave Maria University in FloridaShe was supposed to be an Iron Lady, and she was in the sense that when she asked you a question she expected a quick, accurate, and useful answer. But I know that what my wife and I enjoyed most about her was her warmth and simplicity when we sat at table with her alone.CommentsDavid BerriCo-author, \u0027Stumbling on Wins\u0027; Economics professor, Southern Utah UniversityAs long as schools place winning -- and the ticket sales winning generates -- above the welfare of the students, it seems unlikely we are going to see athletic directors and presidents alter their behavior.CommentsRobert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The Republican bargaining habit is well-established -- take Obama\u0027s \"final\" offer as the new starting point and demand further concessions. With this strategy, our president has let them take him to the cleaners for more than four years now, and is still hoping that sweet reasonableness will produce compromise.Comments (760)John PavleyCTO @ The Huffington Post, BloggerA smarter set of technologies is what we need for the mobile. During periods of high speed and high quality bandwidth, mobile apps should anticipate what we\u0027re going to read or watch and cache it for later. Don\u0027t make us have to remember to pre-download or prepare for being offline.Comments (16)Michael HoganExecutive Arts and Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post Media GroupNo fire, no dragons, no Others, no Khaleesi, no Melisandre, no gratuitous nudity. I\u0027ll say one thing for this episode: it\u0027ll be a cinch to cut it for basic cable. (By then, I doubt they\u0027ll bother to bleep out The Hound\u0027s use of the F-word.)Comments (145)Bill McKibbenAuthor of a dozen books, including \u0027The End of Nature\u0027 and \u0027Deep Economy\u0027Stonewall took place in 1969, and as of last week the Supreme Court was still trying to decide if gay people should be allowed to marry each other. If the climate movement takes that long, we’ll be rallying in scuba masks.Comments (179)Christina HuffingtonWithin seconds, I was crying and grasping for breath on the floor. It had probably already spread to my heart and lungs by now. I had hours to live.Comments (17)Rabbi Shmuley BoteachRabbi and WriterSurely logic would dictate that however misguided the President\u0027s comments about Kamala Harris, they are utterly insignificant compared to the ongoing campaign to make our girls into sexually active women well before it is healthy or appropriate for them to be so.CommentsBlake Kernen7th grader from New Jersey, founder of peaceloveprofits.com, authorApril is Earth Month. Let\u0027s celebrate everybody: the environmentalists and the capitalists who care about preserving and protecting our earth. And just maybe, Hollywood will start rolling out the red carpet for capitalism.Comments (25)Allen FrancesProfessor Emeritus, Duke UniversityAccumulating evidence suggests that animals are a lot smarter and humans are a lot dumber than we previously thought. A recent study shows that the short-term memory of chimpanzees far exceeds what we can expect from ourselves.Comments (16)AmeliaMother, wife, partner and breadwinnerWith politicians there is a lot talk of \"acceptance\" and \"tolerance\" when it comes to homosexuality. I accept the fact that I have to pay taxes. I tolerate the fact that I have to go to the dentist. Why should either of those words apply to how a parent feels about their child?Comments (552)Ingrid NewkirkPresident and co-founder, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA)PETA\u0027s statistics are also often used, as they are being used now, in a truly perverted way by some \"no-kill\" evangelists to try to turn people away from the \"evil\" of what is actually a dignified, merciful release from suffering.Comments (435)Jonathan SchwarzEditor, MichaelMoore.comAlmost no one today remembers Margaret Thatcher\u0027s long history with Iraq. But few people beyond Saddam Hussein played a greater role in shredding the country into tiny little pieces. Here are some highlights.CommentsGov. Peter ShumlinGovernor of VermontFor every piece of good news we hear about women assuming new leadership roles, there is more evidence that our current political culture fails to encourage qualified women to run for office.CommentsMohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOI was struck by what came out of the Troika this week after it finished negotiating the program with the authorities in Cyprus. This is not the first time officials bungle an element of the Cypriot rescue.Comments (79)James FrancoActor and authorLarry Brown\u0027s final story/novella at the end of Big Bad Love, \"92 Days,\" is essentially a story about a struggling writer, Barlow, trying to get published. The drive to be published acts as a reprieve from the rambling life of squalor that Barlow lives.CommentsCharles Garcia, 2013. 8.04Michael J.
