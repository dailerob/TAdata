{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonIt\u0027s become accepted wisdom that Washington has become pathologically polarized and partisan, with every new debate inevitably breaking down along party lines. That\u0027s why it was so remarkable last week when Rand Paul\u0027s old-fashioned talking filibuster scrambled the even more old-fashioned right-vs.-left way of looking at the world. The Paul-provoked debate on the confirmation of John Brennan to head the CIA in turn provoked a wider and critical debate about the use of drones -- a debate that needs to continue well beyond Brennan\u0027s confirmation. Since 2004, only 2 percent of those killed have been confirmed as militant leaders. From mid-2004 to mid-2012, between 474 and 881 civilians were killed in Pakistan. This includes 176 children. Last week\u0027s debate allowed Americans to put themselves in the position of those living under drones overseas -- imagining, even hypothetically, life under drones. And, not surprisingly, most of us didn\u0027t like it.Comments (102)Daniel EllsbergFormer American military analyst who sparked a national uproar in 1971.Today, the Freedom of the Press Foundation has published an audio recording of Bradley Manning\u0027s speech to a military court from two weeks ago, in which he gives his reasons and motivations behind leaking over 700,000 government documents to WikiLeaks.Comments (513)Eric E. SchmidtExecutive Chairman, GoogleIt\u0027s up to others, outside of Silicon Valley, well beyond the tech sector, to embrace an innovation agenda if we are truly to build a new economy -- and new future -- that will endure for generations. Thankfully, this is already happening in places that have historically been at the forefront of innovation: America\u0027s cities.Comments (54)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorAs the Ryan budget, which is really quite divorced from reality outside the hyper-conservative House and has absolutely zero chance of enactment, shows, these budgets have little to do with the actual agreements that determine actual revenues, outlays, and policies.Comments (65)Monique HonamanAuthor, \u0027The High Road Has Less Traffic: honest advice on the path through love and divorce\u0027There are an overwhelming number of women who feel unappreciated by their husbands.Comments (2,715)Lewis LaphamEditor of Lapham\u0027s QuarterlyOver the course of the last two centuries, animals have become all but invisible in the American scheme of things, drummed out of the society of their myth-making companions, gone from the rural as well as the urban landscape.Comments (41)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Paul Ryan\u0027s new budget purportedly gets about 40 percent of its $4.6 trillion in spending cuts over ten years by repealing Obamacare, but Ryan\u0027s budget document doesn\u0027t mention that such a repeal would also lower taxes on corporations and the wealthy that foot Obamacare\u0027s bill.Comments (195)Arianna HuffingtonAt HuffPost, we\u0027re committed to putting the spotlight on organizations leading us into a more compassionate future. Like Chime for Change, which brings together a range of voices, from women\u0027s advocates and experts to business leaders and philanthropists, to seize a moment in which girls\u0027 and women\u0027s issues are in many ways front and center.CommentsJohn DearChristian peace activist, author of \u0027Lazarus, Come Forth!\u0027 and \u0027A Persistent Peace.\u0027 www.johndear.orgLast week, an extraordinary, historic event occurred. The government of Norway invited all the nations of the world to a two-day conference to discuss the humanitarian effects of nuclear war and to begin the process to ban all nuclear weapons.CommentsLisa BelkinSenior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, The Huffington PostThe best advice I ever received as a mother was \"ask for help.\" It was given to me by one of the few of my friends who\u0027d started this parenting thing before I had, and who\u0027d been determined, she finally confessed, to make it look easy.Comments (14)Trita ParsiPresident, National Iranian American CouncilAlmost ten years to the day of the foolish invasion of Iraq, the discrepancy that existed between the media description of the Iraqi threat and the non-manipulated assessment of the U.S. intelligence community is being seen again -- but this time on Iran.Comments (18)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistHere\u0027s a riddle: A trucker is sitting in a bar next to a feminist. They\u0027ve both had a lot to drink and they\u0027re arguing. The feminist says women have been oppressed for centuries -- the trucker says they haven\u0027t. The feminist says women deserve equal pay -- the trucker says they don\u0027t. The feminist says a woman should be president -- the trucker just laughs.Comments (1,724)Rev. Amy ZiettlowGenX Pastor, Writer, and Host of FamilyScholars ConversationsI was reading the bios out loud, enjoying a warm mother-daughter moment, when my daughter\u0027s face fell.Comments (139)One For The Tableoneforthetable.comThe majority of food trucks in Austin aren\u0027t trucks at all. With tires mere props, these trucks are trailers. Since they never move, trailers can offer customers creature comforts like picnic benches and umbrellas.CommentsDean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027There is the possibility that the Justice Department really believes that prosecuting the criminal activities of Bank of America or JP Morgan could sink the economy. If this is true then it make the case for breaking up the big banks even more of a slam dunk.Comments (406)Joseph BobrowFounder and president, Coming Home ProjectThe 60 Minutes piece last Sunday on the life and death of Clay Hunt, a Marine who earned a Purple Heart serving in the Marines in Iraq and Afghanistan, demonstrated how much we have yet to learn about the epidemic of suicide in our returning troops and veterans.Comments (16)Robert ScheerEditor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027Go offshore, young man, and avoid paying taxes. Plunder at will in those foreign lands, and if you get in trouble, Uncle Sam will come rushing to your assistance, diplomatically, financially and militarily, even if you have managed to avoid paying for those government services.Comments (166)Peggy ElliottReformed sit-com writerI am not attracted to men with facial hair. It\u0027s not really a phobia, though I confess I am somewhat ambivalent about both Santa Claus and Jesus. It is all because of my childhood Pediatrician - my parents called him a baby doctor - had a mustache exactly like Adolf Hitler\u0027s.Comments (32)Lincee RayTV enthusiastIt turns out that an elephant, a loving father, a weepy mother and two children who surely have Pottery Barn Kids modeling deals in the works turned out to be more entertaining than the super secretive \"letter of doom\" we\u0027ve been teased about for weeks.Comments (44)Joe PeyronninHofstra Journalism ProfessorAs Roman Catholic cardinals gather in the magnificent Sistine Chapel to select a new pope, their conclave is at a critical crossroads. Will the cardinals vote for a pope who can re-energize the faithful, and restore the trust that has been missing for millions of lapsed Catholics?CommentsMark Hyman, MDPracticing physicianThese ideas are false.

We will make sure it is burned (just a little more slowly).Comments (50)Emma GrayAssociate Editor, HuffPost WomenI\u0027m not sure that Glamour\u0027s topless cover shots are appealing to women because the cover models\u0027 breasts are \"average.\"Comments (37)Kathleen PeddicordPublisher, Live and Invest OverseasWelcome to the world of exchange rates.
