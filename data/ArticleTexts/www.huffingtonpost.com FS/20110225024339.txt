{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"We are now locked in the great budget battle of 2011. Who will win, the president or House Republicans? It\u0027s impossible to say yet, but I do know who is going to lose: us. In fact, we\u0027ve already lost. This is due, in part, to the fact that our country no longer seems capable of coming up with anything other than what Tom Friedman once called \"suboptimal\" solutions to our problems. Just look at this so-called \"debate\" we\u0027re having. It is concentrated almost entirely on the debt side of the equation and barely at all on ways to grow the economy. How has the playing field of what is acceptable in this debate been so shrunken that the only two competing proposals still allowed on the field are the president\u0027s cuts and the House GOP\u0027s draconian cuts? It turns out this was no accident.Read Post | CommentsJason Linkins, 02.24.2011Editor, Eat the PressDo you have the impression that the Affordable Care Act was actually repealed?

Carolyn Maloney, 02.24.2011Congresswoman from New YorkThe current attack on women\u0027s personal liberties, our access to reproductive health services and our right to lifesaving medical care is stunning in its scope, appalling in its indifference, and outrageous in its arrogance.Read Post | CommentsBruce Reyes-Chow, 02.24.2011Pastor, Blogger, DadAnd while I applaud President Obama\u0027s recent decision regarding the Defense of Marriage Act, I for one believe that the government should get out of the marriage business all together.Read Post | CommentsBernard Weisberger, 02.24.2011Historian; Author, \u0027The LaFollettes of Wisconsin: Love and Politics in Progressive America\u0027If we ourselves light candles from the flame kindled in Madison and carry them to our communities, then the tumult in Madison could resemble events in the 1890s that provoked a political revolt against the first Gilded Age.Read Post | CommentsJeff Jarvis, 02.24.2011Author: \u0027Public Parts\u0027, \u0027What Would Google Do?\u0027In the Guardian, Jonathan Freedland is the latest curmudgeon to recycle Nick Carr\u0027s distraction trope, microwave it, and serve it with gravy.
