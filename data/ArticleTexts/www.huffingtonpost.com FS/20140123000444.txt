{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonGreetings from Davos. I\u0027m here for the 44th annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, where the theme is \"The Reshaping of the World: Consequences for Society, Politics and Business,\" and we\u0027ve chosen this moment to launch The WorldPost, in partnership with the Berggruen Institute on Governance, as a hub for everything from political and economic news to discussions of the cultural and artistic forces shaping and reshaping our increasingly global collective imagination. It\u0027s a moment that represents the culmination of more than a year of conversations between Nicolas Berggruen, our editor-in-chief Nathan Gardels, executive editor Peter Goodman and me about the need for a global platform that can bring together a mix of perspectives, from world leaders to young people whose voices might otherwise go unheard, original reporting and a platform built for engagement and conversation.Comments (86)Paul PolmanCEO, UnileverPermissible growth in the future has to be based on sustainable and equitable models. Having acquired a license to operate, it\u0027s time for business to earn a license to lead.CommentsChrystia FreelandLiberal member of the Canadian ParliamentThe recognition by Pope Francis and others that surging income inequality is an urgent political problem marks an important shift.Comments (45)Richard BransonFounder, Virgin GroupTo finally break the fossil fuel cycle that leads to warming and war, new and disruptive energy technologies (from advanced renewable fuels, to electric cars that leave their petrol-powered rivals behind, to more efficient, lower-cost solar cells and intelligent ways of heating and cooling buildings) need adequate financial backing.Comments (39)Ding XuedongChairman, China Investment CorporationAfter the 2008 international financial crisis, global trade and investment protectionism has again been resurgent. Policy barriers are becoming more covert, populism and provincial politics are causing greater disruption and policies are increasingly being made in a self-centered way. This trend deserves our high alert.CommentsWalter IsaacsonPresident and CEO, Aspen InstituteInnovation is wonderful, but on its own it\u0027s not the holy grail. Other things matter just as much in creating a great company or product, most notably execution and focus. Apple excels at these things. That\u0027s why I use an iPhone and iPad. Innovation without execution produces footnotes to history, such as the Xerox Alto and Star.CommentsSarah BrownCo-Founder, A World at School; Executive Chair, Global Business Coalition for EducationBasic education and learning is too often neglected when dividing up aid and young boys and girls are held back for years -- if not a lifetime -- by the absence of good schooling mindful of the life skills and employment skills that will serve them well.CommentsJames MooreBest selling author, TV political analystThe story is true. Every damned bit of it. Wendy Davis of Fort Worth, Texas was a single mother. A teenaged mom. She lived in a mobile home. And went to Harvard. Also, she got help along the way. Can you believe it?Comments (103)Larry Summers and Gavin YameyIf we make the right investments in the health sector today, we could achieve universally low rates of infectious, maternal and child deaths by 2035.CommentsRichard (RJ) EskowSenior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host, Take Action NewsWhat does it mean for a representative democracy when most of its representatives are insulated from the real-world economic experiences of its citizens?Comments (44)Jamie KrugWriter, SAHM, CMO - Chief Medical Officer (of my family), Wife, Blogger at OurStrokeOfLuck.netThey don\u0027t have to imagine how my favorite childhood characters from books walk or talk, what their voices sound like or how they interact with their friends and family -- it\u0027s all right there, laid out in front of them on screens both big and small.CommentsPascal Lamy and Ian GoldinWhile the future is full of opportunity, it is also highly uncertain and characterized by growing systemic risks. In many cases, these risks are the consequences of our success, arising from rising incomes, population growth, interconnectedness and technological advances.CommentsAllen FrancesProfessor Emeritus, Duke UniversityPsychiatry is a noble and essential calling that should not be judged by the faltering incompetence of the American Psychiatric Association. We need to rectify the mistakes of the past if we are to establish the much needed higher standards for the future.CommentsPeter S. GoodmanExecutive Business and Global News Editor, The Huffington PostThe WorldPost is a product of the idea that the most foundational challenges of our era, from the perils of climate change to the epidemic of youth unemployment, can neither be understood nor addressed through the traditional frame of the nation state, but require collective efforts spanning geography and cultures.CommentsJonathan ZittrainProfessor of Law and Computer Science, Harvard University; Founder, Berkman Centre for Internet and SocietyPerceived digital warfare is escalating as a sophisticated breed of attack against corporations, governments and individuals.CommentsRob ReinaldaWriter, 28 years in print journalismThere\u0027s nothing worse than sentences that begin, \"There\u0027s nothing worse than...\" Unless, of course, you\u0027re being ironic to illustrate a point; then it\u0027s acceptable. Quite brilliant, actually.CommentsAmitai EtzioniProfessor of international relations, George Washington UniversityIt is impossible to prove an alternative history, what would have happened had Biden\u0027s Boots Off the Ground strategy been followed. But I found that as far as can be determined, the U.S. -- and many millions of people in the Middle East -- would be much safer and better off if Biden\u0027s counsel was heeded.CommentsJie-Song ZhangProducer and Director of international arts \u0026 cultural exchange projects; Violinist; Contributor, National GeographicI am curious if you have ever found a moment, undressed of your \"Tiger Mom, celebrity author\" costume and all of the salesmanship it entails, to sit in your natural skin as an Asian-American, and as a mother, to properly measure how the thoughts you spread might affect our community, and in particular our youth.Comments (13)Jillian BermanAssociate Business Editor, The Huffington PostEven armed with the knowledge that the conversation was probably going to go my way and the feeling that I did deserve more, I had a tough time getting the words out of my mouth. After the talk ended, I was relieved, but not completely.Comments (35)Lincoln Mitchelllincolnmitchell.comAs the 2016 election approaches, it is likely that we will also be told that having a clear nominee early in the process, rather than a hard-fought, and potentially nasty, campaign for the nomination will be good for the party. This idea is intuitive and attractive, but it should be noted that it also completely false.CommentsPatte BarthDirector, Center for Public EducationFar from an education revolution, the political attention given choice and competition is diverting us from the hard work of making sure public schools prepare every child for their next steps after graduation.CommentsTimothy KarrCampaign Director, Free Press and SavetheInternet.comIt\u0027s a troubling sign that the information age has entered a new era -- one where our rights to connect and communicate are under constant siege by governments and corporations.CommentsFernando Henrique CardosoFormer President of Brazil; Member of the Berggruen Institute’s 21st Century CouncilEveryone sees the gap between the claims of the Brazilian miracle and the reality of daily life. People want more accountability to fix Brazil\u0027s institutions.CommentsDr. Judith RodinPresident of the Rockefeller FoundationBy pursuing the resilience dividend, cities can get an economic leg up and better prepare for what\u0027s next. Because no matter if the next shock hits tomorrow or 10 years from now, resilience is something a city can realize the benefits of each and every day.CommentsKumi NaidooExecutive Director, Greenpeace InternationalBusiness elites and politicians continue to suffer from an acute case of cognitive dissonance. All the facts are there, we need to re-think and re-design our economies, yet they are largely in denial about the scale and pace of the necessary change.CommentsAnne-Marie SlaughterPresident and CEO, The New American FoundationReports, panel discussions and media reports still focus overwhelmingly on measuring the participation of women in what has traditionally been the world of men. But it is equally important to measure the participation of men in what has traditionally been the world of women.Comments (55)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action Networke simply cannot celebrate Dr. King, then turn around and watch efforts to dismantle the very things he fought and died for. Here we are recognizing such an esteemed figure and a national holiday, yet the Supreme Court recently gutted part of the Voting Rights Act itself.CommentsThe B TeamNot-for-profit prioritizing people and planet alongside profitWith the UN Climate Change negotiations underway, and as the United Nations designs its flagship Sustainable Development Goals in 2015, business needs to engage.CommentsRachelle FriedmanBlogger; speaker; ambassador for the spinal cord injury communityUnless you yourself are paralyzed or you know someone who is, how could you possibly know everything about our world? So I\u0027m here to set the record straight on some common misconceptions.CommentsRichard ZombeckFounder, BluZink at www.bluzink.comWe\u0027re finally having a discussion about income inequality and the enormous disparity in wealth in this country. Is it really a surprise to anyone that Walmart is the go-to example of what\u0027s wrong in this country?CommentsTerry O\u0027NeillPresident, National Organization for WomenAs we observe the anniversary of the historic Roe v. Wade decision, it\u0027s vital to remember that every woman has the right to have the children she wants, raise the children she has, plan her own family and make her own health care decisions. That means women must have the social, economic and political power to pursue their goals.CommentsThomas White, 2014.22.01Tony Newman, 2014.22.01Liquor.com, 2014.22.01Tom King, 2014.22.01Adrienne Vendetti, 2014.22.01Liquor.com, 2014.22.01MaryEllen Tribby, 2014.22.01Maia James, 2014.22.01Will Travers, 2014.22.01Keith Gaby, 2014.22.01Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"SHERMAN: \u0027THUG\u0027 NOW THE \u0027ACCEPTED WAY OF CALLING SOMEBODY THE N-WORD\u0027",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
