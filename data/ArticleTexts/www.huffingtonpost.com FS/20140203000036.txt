{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week we were told that the State of our Union is, as per usual, strong. President Obama, also as per usual, gave a solid speech. But it was hard to take it as much more than political theater (albeit theater with a wildly skewed entertainment-to-applause ratio). Given what we know about D.C. dysfunction, boilerplate bits like \"let\u0027s work together\" and \"let\u0027s all come together\" played like laugh lines. And despite the presidential exhortation, \"let\u0027s make this a year of action,\" progress in Congress will more likely look like traffic in Atlanta in the wake of Tuesday\u0027s snowstorm. For some actual action, we\u0027ll have to tune into the Super Bowl, where even if the game is a dud, the commercials usually rock. Maybe next year\u0027s SOTU should include breaks featuring Scarlett Johansson or puppies and Clydesdales.Comments (15)Howard FinemanEditorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupThe polls say that President Barack Obama is at a low point, but you couldn’t tell it from the tour de force of his State of the Union speech. He was standing at the podium, but seemed to have a spring in his step. His smile was winning; his enthusiasm for America’s future infectious.Comments (3,050)Michael MooreOscar and Emmy-winning DirectorIn the State of the Union tonight, President Obama is going to call for a national minimum wage of $10.10. Then the Republicans will say that\u0027d be a huge disaster that would make the Washington Monument fall over, Mt. Rushmore explode, etc. But here\u0027s what neither will tell you.Comments (856)Arianna HuffingtonBrazilians are social by nature, both online and off, making Brazil the perfect place for The Huffington Post to expand our platform, which is all about conversation and engagement.Comments (43)Dax ShepardActor, director, and writerA few days ago my wife and I wrote tweets urging folks to boycott publications that buy photos of celebrities\u0027 children without the consent of their parents. We got a myriad of responses, ranging from heartfelt solidarity to vitriolic rage. Now, against the advice of my better half, I am going to address some of those Twitter detractors.Comments (102)Maria ShriverAward-winning journalist, bestselling author and activistFor too many American women, the dream of \"having it all\" has morphed into \"just hanging on.\" This is not about handouts. This is about smart economic policy. Working women are the core of our economy. Leave them out and you don\u0027t have a robust economy. Lead with them and you do.Comments (23)John MellencampMusician and ActivistPete Seeger\u0027s life-long commitment to the cause of peace and to addressing the plight of the downtrodden has been an inspiration to all those who have championed society\u0027s victims and have done what they could to combat injustice.Comments (12)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundBlack history is American history. I hope this Black History Month is not just about our history but about our obligation to protect our children and move our nation forward in our multiracial world.Comments (122)Michael E. MannDirector of Penn State Earth System Science Center; Author of \u0027Dire Predictions\u0027 and \u0027The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars\u0027Although the current temperatures in the eastern U.S. may seem unusually cold, in the context of our history they really aren\u0027t. In fact, most of the cold that has made the news lately hasn\u0027t been all that chilly compared what was \"normal\" for the 20th century.Comments (67)Sen. Elizabeth WarrenDemocratic Senator from MassachusettsWith post offices and postal workers already on the ground, USPS could partner with banks to make a critical difference for millions of Americans who don\u0027t have basic banking services because there are almost no banks or bank branches in their neighborhoods.Comments (1,344)Cherie BlairFounder, Cherie Blair Foundation for WomenLast week, I attended my sixth Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) at Davos, Switzerland. I attended many of the sessions in and out of the forum and there was no shortage of women\u0027s faces. But appearances can be deceptive.Comments (21)Mark Ruffalo and Wenonah HauterIn previous years, President Obama has used his platform to promote his \"all of the above\" energy plan, which includes significantly expanding domestic oil and gas production -- i.e. fracking -- thus betraying the promises he articulated in his nomination speech at the 2008 DNC.Comments (49)Rached GhannouchiPresident of Tunisia\u0027s Ennahdha PartyOn the third anniversary of the Arab Spring, the principal question is: has the Tunisian model for democratic transition succeeded in placing Tunisia on the path of democracy? And what are the principal features of this model that make it successful?CommentsRep. Debbie Wasserman SchultzAuthor, \u0027For the Next Generation\u0027; Chair, Democratic National CommitteeA raise of the federal minimum wage is one of those common-sense proposals that is both good for the economy and good for the country. Considering there has not been an increase since July 2009, workers who depend on these wages have been losing income to inflation for over four years. A raise is long overdue.Comments (77)David CoatesWorrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsNo politician these days gets any traction from the exploitation of bad news, unless he/she is currently out of power and, like the GOP, trying to work their way back in.Comments (20)Taylor HirthChildren\u0027s advocate and motherI have composed this sample buget. It accounts for the things that many people expect lower income families to maintain, and maintain without public assistance. It doesn\u0027t account for saving for college for our children, saving for retirement, or saving for much of anything at all.Comments (268)Ben HallmanSenior Financial Writer, The Huffington PostAn accounting of my spending reveals that when I told my daughter we couldn\u0027t afford the book, what I meant was that I\u0027d rather spend that money on something else. That something, in most instances, is beer.Comments (81)Ellie SleeOne third of ThingsWeWish.comBeyonce: when you smile affectionately and sing along with that lyric, you are propagating a cycle of humiliation, of rape, of violence that is still horrifically real for women all over the world.Comments (245)Albert II of MonacoReigning monarch of the Principality of MonacoThere are initiatives underway in the sector of philanthropy that are not top-down, but ingenious, effective, and inspiring. We need to bring more attention to these efforts, in order to spur a new and vigorous approach to more effective giving around the world.Comments (11)TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"NPR and TEDWeekends have teamed up to explore the state of privacy today. It it worth fighting for? Or should we accept that sharing information, willingly (on social media, for example) or unwillingly (through government surveillance) is the wave of the future? An artist, a lawyer, a hacker, an economist and an entrepreneur share their ideas on the meaning of privacy in the 21st century.Comments (27)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027\"The transformation of the world, which many of us long to see, requires the changing of frameworks, ethics, and, most of all, our decisions; and that will not happen without taking risks, a true leap of faith.\"CommentsTavis SmileyPBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti joins me tonight on PBS to preview tomorrow\u0027s State of the Union address, during which it is anticipated that President Obama will lay out plans to address poverty and income inequality as part of the 2014 legislative agenda.CommentsSherrie Campbell, PhDVeteran, licensed PsychologistOur children are the lights of our lives. We all start off as parents envisioning nothing but success, love and happiness for them. However, these dreams often do not manifest because they are not getting the important things they need to become disciplined, mature and motivated adults.Comments (102)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorAfter 94 years, on January 27, 2014, the world lost Pete Seeger. The world is the lesser for that loss. I met and spoke to Pete Seeger a few times and can attest to his steady determination and uplifting spirit.Comments (15)Emma GraySenior Editor, HuffPost WomenJackson simply had the bad luck to be a black woman in possession of a nipple. Even today, we see the policing of women\u0027s bodies -- and their breasts in particular -- by media gatekeepers.Comments (147)Kevin SmithThat fat guy who got thrown off the planeI\u0027ll miss you, Jim. Thanks for shaping the last two decades of my life. Rest in peace knowing you were an absolute success and, with the exception of that one mall picture, you made some excellent, unforgettable movies.CommentsTed Danson and Andrew SharplessIt\u0027s not often that someone can make a philanthropic investment that simultaneously fights climate change, biodiversity loss, and world hunger. But Michael Bloomberg is doing just that.CommentsMarlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistEarlier this month, I shared Martha Stewart\u0027s recollections of the single piece of advice that would ultimately shape her career. Today, we hear from CNN\u0027s Chief International Correspondent Christiane Amanpour, who reveals how even the harshest of words can inspire us to realize our dreams.CommentsJim Yong KimPresident, World Bank GroupMyanmar is emerging decisively from conflict, fragility, and isolation toward a prosperous and peaceful future. It is in the midst of a triple transition: from a military government to democracy, from conflict in border areas to peace, and from a state-centered to a market-oriented economy.CommentsBarbara BrunoNFL Analyst and Commentator, Independent Film Producer, Non-Profit Grant WriterIn the shadow of the NFL\u0027s biggest game, the Broncos defensive and Seahawks offensive players must feel like the forgotten stepchildren of Super Bowl hype.CommentsMehdi HasanPolitical director of The Huffington Post UKEnough with the apologies. Week after week, senior Labour figures queue up to express regret over the party\u0027s record on immigration... Give it a rest, folks. For a start, the mea culpas are unnecessary.Comments (50)Meghan Ralston, 2014. 2.02Lana Gorlinski, 2014. 2.02Leslie Sisman, 2014. 2.02Leslie Sisman, 2014. 2.02Joe Peyronnin, 2014. 2.02Jesse Kornbluth, 2014. 2.02Tim Giago, 2014. 2.02Hon.
