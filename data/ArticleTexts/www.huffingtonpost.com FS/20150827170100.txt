{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureFor years, Republicans have used race bait politics to consolidate their support among white, working class voters. For years, they postured about military action for partisan advantage. For years, they have worshipped Reagan as a man on a horse who rode in to save the country. Now Trump\u0027s tropes recycle these themes, in more nationalist, bawdy and bigoted rants. And in indicting our failed trade policies, defending Social Security and Medicare, questioning mindless interventions, he strays from the Republican gospel to appeal to the concerns of working Americans. He\u0027s calling out the phonies and offering himself as a true man on the horse to make America great again. The Republican establishment may just find themselves reaping what they have sown.One day, you realize how absurd your current mindset is, that this shit doesn\u0027t matter. You let your demons go, knowing that, perhaps, sharing your story can help some other chubby, goofy, socially-isolated, sensitive kid getting bulled in America who feels like no one in the world cares about him.Former NFL playerMy gold medal is my most-prized possession -- I\u0027m so proud of it. However, I never wanted my kids to feel like they had to have a gold medal in order to be considered a success... so I haven\u0027t displayed my medal. Here\u0027s where it currently lives...Public speaker, activist, OlympianMost agree that the work to reinvent New Orleans remains unfinished. That\u0027s true, especially because post-Katrina New Orleans is trending back toward its old self -- a sluggish regional economy with high inequality and not enough opportunities for its residents. That was certainly not the vision.Co-Director and Senior Fellow, Metropolitan Policy Program at Brookings InstituteLet\u0027s pretend for a minute that Trump is a serious candidate who really believes the views he espouses on the campaign trail. His xenophobic, racist, unrealistic statements on immigration are getting all the attention, but I think another of his go-to themes is also acting as a major draw for supporters: His argument that he is not beholden to donors.Writer and ProfessorThe Treasury Department\u0027s exciting announcement that U.S. paper currency will soon feature the image of a historical American female was a long time coming.Treasurer of the United StatesWhile clicktivism (sometimes called slacktivism) has had its share of critics, the case of Amir Hekmati demonstrates that it can be an effective tool in implementing change.Campaign coordinator, Free Amir campaignThe failure to implement even the most general or common sense reforms in the light of 800 mass shootings is an absolute refusal to lead on the part of Congress. It\u0027s a flat out disregard for the safety of American citizens. It\u0027s shameful political cowardice.Navy veteran and Co-Director of the Truman National Security Project San Diego ChapterDaesh (\"ISIS\") recently destroyed an ancient monastery and a church. This, after abducting several Christians, in what has become the group\u0027s long scourge on humanity. Contrary to ISIS\u0027s ignorance and propaganda, Prophet Muhammad sought to protect the rights of Christians.Visiting Fellow, Harvard University\u0027s Prince Alwaleed bin Talal School of Islamic StudiesHollywood, it seems, wants to give Lily Tomlin an award. I\u0027m all for it; she\u0027s been around a long time and has done consistently brilliant work. But if she gets an Oscar, it shouldn\u0027t be for her new movie, Grandma, which has been receiving rapturous reviews from just about everyone.Davidson-Kahn Distinguished University Professor and Professor of Law at Florida International University; Floershimer Distinguished Visiting Professor of Law at Cardozo Law SchoolWhat William F. Buckley and Gore Vidal did for discourse in America was unprecedented. They proved there was a time not so long ago we relished hearing both sides of political arguments. And there is a time -- call it the present -- when a hunger for authenticity seems to be driving both parties in unexpected directions.CEO, Professional Investor and Chairman, Intelligence Squared U.S. DebatesClinton\u0027s position on church-state separation is inconsistent. While she was a strong advocate for secular education, she\u0027s also supported religiously backed discrimination in the past and is close to a number of Religious Right leaders. It\u0027s difficult to predict how she would handle these issue once in office.Executive Director, American Humanist AssociationSanders is unwilling to break with the U.S.-Saudi alliance that has done such damage to both the Arab people and the American people. Now, we have a full-fledged, Israeli-Saudi alliance, and it must be music to the ears of pro-Israeli journalists for Sanders to be calling for U.S. backing of further Saudi domination.Communications director, Institute for Public AccuracyIt is easy to view our students as essentially trapped in school, and so it doesn\u0027t matter how we spend their time because they never had any control over their schedule anyway. Wrong. We\u0027re talking about minutes of fellow human beings\u0027 lives. Don\u0027t waste them.Teacher and writer; blogger, curmudgucation.blogspot.comGeorge W. Bush, not Bernie Sanders, is the real \"socialist\" of our generation, primarily because the economy collapsed under his tenure and as a result, the conservative president began an ongoing program of government stimulus into various industries.Columnist published in The Cleveland Plain Dealer, The Baltimore Sun, The Hill, Salon, The Jerusalem Post www.hagoodman.comWhen we get caught up in the need to respond and stay plugged in at all times, we are operating out of fear, which isn\u0027t helpful in any kind of communication -- business or personal. A few tips to shift your relationship with your inbox -- and the people you\u0027re emailing:Creative Wellness Coach \u0026 CheerleaderOn Women\u0027s Equality Day, we write to echo the hundreds of thousands of grassroots activists who support the Women On 20s campaign. As we continue making progress for the cause of women\u0027s rights, we hope to preserve Alexander Hamilton\u0027s place on our currency while elevating a woman to a place she deserves.U.S. Representative for New Jersey\u0027s 9th congressional districtDelegate to the U.S. House of Representatives from the U.S. Virgin Island’s at-large congressional district, attorneyThe truth is, for black people with roots in this city, the recovery isn\u0027t complete. And many of us are asking ourselves: What is the place for black people in post-Katrina New Orleans?New York-based writer, editor and producerHere\u0027s a preview of the exciting new books on work and psychology. Instead of just spouting their opinions, these authors bring us real data.Wharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027My alliance is obviously with the pro-choice contingent, but I was disappointed with their advocates making no mention of people with Down Syndrome. They only spoke about \"Down Syndrome\" as a potential cause for concern for expectant mothers.Writing, blogging, homeschooling. www.atypicalson.comWe Actually Agree with Glenn Greenwald; Lindsey Graham Wants to Fight Trump; Trumps Latest Polling; Biden Joining the Race; Trump\u0027s Hat and Making America Great; and much more..Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027Real, authentic leaders seek to heal, not to dig deeper canyons of differences within our communities.Political strategistIn the absence of instant security gratification at a time when breaches have become the third certainty in life and consumers are the product -- how do we better protect ourselves?Author of Swiped. Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and IDT911Make no mistake, however. There\u0027s nothing gender neutral about having a baby. Pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum recovery are strictly women\u0027s issues. Since healthy women are the foundation for producing healthy babies, the design of any family leave program must prioritize the needs of women over those of men.Healthcare Strategist, Political Commentator, Solution SeekerOur opponents refer to paid sick days as \"fringe benefits,\" an \"extra\" handed out by employers when they can afford it. But the reality is, sick time should be a basic part of compensation, a minimum standard that keeps employers from docking workers\u0027 pay or kicking them out of a job for being a good parent or following doctor\u0027s orders.Director, Family Values @ WorkI never intended to be a voice for pit bull type dogs. Never in a million years. My life has quite literally gone to the dogs over the years. And while I never intended to be any type of voice for pit bull-type dogs, this is why I care so much and will never stop being a voice for them, either.Humane Society Director/Humane Agent, Army Veteran, dog rehabilitator, and pit bull advocate. #dontbullymybreedThanks to their occupations, these jetsetters know when and where to book flights, what to pack and how to get the ultimate local experience. Rookie travel mistakes were made in years past and now serve as a source of abundant knowledge.U.S. News \u0026 World Report TravelThe scale and nature of Iran\u0027s intervention in Iraq will have profound consequences for regional security and the struggle against ISIS. Unless the US or the GCC provide large-scale assistance to fundamentally reshape the balance of power in Iraq, escalated Iranian involvement could push Iraq closer than ever to becoming a failed state.MPhil student, University of OxfordApproximately 13 percent of the U.S. population is foreign-born, of which about six percent are naturalized U.S. citizens. Given the image associated with immigrants, one would assume that all Americans in the U.S., natural born or naturalized, have equal worth as citizens. This, however, is not necessarily the case.Blogger and a freelance columnistWe face exceptional threats against our nation but, as evident from the president\u0027s declaration of the state of emergency, Tunisians are determined not to give in. As a group less likely to commit terrorist acts but disproportionately affected by terrorism, women must play a critical role in countering violent extremism.State Secretary for Finance, Tunisia. Co-founder of Tounissiet -- NGO to empower women leadersIf the state-level Republicans do decide to create loyalty oaths in a naked bid to keep Donald Trump off their primary ballots, his supporters are going to be enraged.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
