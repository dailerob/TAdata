{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Tessa GouldDirector, HuffPost Partner StudioThe banter around native advertising, and more specifically native content publishing, reached fever pitch this year. Every man and his dog had a view on how it should be defined, measured, labeled, scaled and priced. And while the the jury may still be out on a number of these issues, one thing we do know here at HuffPost Partner Studio is bloody good native content when we see it.CommentsRichard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FuturePresident Lyndon Johnson declared war on poverty in his first State of the Union message, 50 years ago. That speech was delivered to a Congress and a nation still grieving the assassination of a young and vibrant president. \"Let us carry forward the plans and programs of John Fitzgerald Kennedy,\" said Johnson, \"not because of our sorrow or sympathy, but because they are right.\" Johnson knew that some of his colleagues might pay a price for their political courage on this issue. But he rejected the path of centrist convenience in his moral call to fellow Democrats. A generation later, the ranks of the poor, which swelled after Wall Street triggered the 2008 crisis, have too often remained out of sight and out of mind to a political and media class obsessed with false arguments about deficit reduction and \"downsizing government.\"Comments (152)Joseph A. PalermoProfessor, historian, authorToday, as Orwell predicted, we need a new political language. \"Reform\" is being used in our political discourse by the wealthy and corporate mouthpieces as code for privatizing and deregulating every public service they can get their greedy hands on.Comments (12)Cindi LeiveEditor-in-chief, Glamour; author, \u0027100 Recipes Every Woman Should Know\u0027Unplugging was harder than it looked -- for the first few days I had phantom-phone syndrome, the constant urge during any spare second of time to reach for my small, rectangular best friend. But I persevered. Four things I discovered...CommentsPablo EisenbergSenior Fellow, Georgetown Public Policy InstituteWhen President Lyndon Baines Johnson declared an \"unconditional war on poverty\" fifty years ago, it marked the first time the federal government had ever launched an aggressive program to eliminate poverty. Sadly, it was the last time an American President turned out to be a strong advocate for poor people.Comments (13)Martha J. BaileyAssociate Professor, University of MichiganCritics are right that the War on Poverty has been expensive, but wrong to call it a failure. Yes, poverty is still with us, but many of its often forgotten programs were landmark successes.Comments (27)Christine Gross-LohAuthor, Parenting Without Borders: Surprising Lessons Parents Around the World Can Teach UsThough parents around the world have the same goals, American parents like me (despite our very best intentions) have gotten it all backwards.Comments (1,242)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesIt was Time magazine that dreamed up the word \"outing\" back in 1990. Specifically, it was now-deceased William Henry III, a Pulitzer Prize-winning cultural critic, who coined the term to define what he saw as a terrible invasion of privacy against even the most vile and homophobic closeted public figures by gay activists and gay journalists, and, most pointedly, by me.Comments (66)Carly PaulLiving in ColoradoThis is how I came to be in poverty\u0027s grip. It was not overnight, and it was not all because of me, and not all because a system that failed me, and not all because of a dysfunctional family, and not all because of overblown capitalism, and not all because of any one thing.CommentsTimothy KarrCampaign Director, Free Press and SavetheInternet.comRupert Murdoch is plotting his empire\u0027s expansion -- growth that could include purchases of Tribune Company newspapers and, reportedly, Time Inc. But will 2014 be the year that the media mogul, who\u0027s skilled at reinventing himself and burying old mistakes, is finally held to account?CommentsLincoln Mitchelllincolnmitchell.comBefore we address income inequality, we must recognize that it is a problem and that, for example, this is now a country where most children born into poverty live their whole lives in poverty and where the opportunities enjoyed by the children of the wealthy are dramatically different from those of poor children.CommentsAndrea LeverePresident, Corporation for Enterprise DevelopmentTake a single mother with an income of $15,500. When her income increases to $15,600, statisticians will celebrate that we\u0027ve moved that mother and her child out of poverty. But is there really much reason to celebrate? Is the mother now financially secure?CommentsWilliam BradleyPolitical AnalystI like Robert Gates. He\u0027s a professional, a grown-up. He\u0027s a thoughtful, reasonable Republican at a time when such are overshadowed by something very different. I agree with him on many things. But his \"Mission Impossible\" assignment to salvage Iraq and Afghanistan is blinding him.CommentsAmb. Marc GinsbergFmr. U.S. Ambassador to Morocco \u0026 White House Middle East AdviserWhile recruiting a broad range of international actors, Kerry single-handedly has forced the actors to focus on a common framework to guide the ongoing talks. While Kerry still has his skeptics, he has everyone\u0027s admiration for his efforts. Well, almost everyone.CommentsJessica SmockWriter, Educator, ResearcherIf you share the fact that your toddler pooped repeatedly during nap time, wait for a reply. If you\u0027re met with awkward silence and a swift subject change, retreat! If, however, she responds with, \"OMG! Mine smeared poop all over the crib today!\", then you\u0027re golden.CommentsDr. Mark Dybul and Dr. Julio FrenkEmerging powers are well positioned to have an enormous impact on the regions in which they reside as well as on the global stage. They should maximize this impact in positive and mutually beneficial ways, helping to lead and support strategies for global and regional growth.CommentsJeff DanzigerPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideCommentsJohn BridgelandCEO, Civic EnterprisesGiven the needs today, with high youth unemployment, 6.7 million young people disconnected from school and work, two million veterans returning from war, and public lands and waterways in desperate need of our attention, our country has the opportunity to marry vulnerable resources once again.CommentsAlissa ParkerBlogger, TheParkerFive and co-founder, safeandsoundschools.orgThe year anniversary was just one of many many ways we have felt connected to our little Em. So, as cliché as it might sound, I know I didn\u0027t get my goodbye that day because she has never truly left us.CommentsCaleb HouseknechtSocial media manager, KegWorks.comMy bad mood disappeared, and I thought about this phenomenon. Snow. In Buffalo. It\u0027s one of those things. Other people talk about it a lot, but I\u0027d bet we talk about it even more, and mostly, we\u0027re complaining. But, honestly, is it really that bad?CommentsRep. Mike MichaudU.S. Congressman representing Maine\u0027s 2nd DistrictYou know the old adage \"As Maine goes, so goes the nation\"? Well, under the leadership of my opponent for governor, Gov. Paul LePage, that is no longer the case. Instead of leading Maine, he is making us fall behind.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorAccess to decent education, starting with preschool, remains a significant challenge even here in wealthy America, and of course far more so in less developed countries. Many of the world\u0027s kids will apparently tell you so.CommentsPeter DreierE.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeWe know how to reduce poverty. Within a decade after President Johnson declare a War on Poverty, we cut the nation\u0027s poverty rate in half. We should commit ourselves to cutting it in half once again by 2025.Comments (19)Arianna HuffingtonI\u0027ve just returned from the most amazing place. I\u0027m not talking about Hawaii, where I spent the holidays with my daughters, my sister and my ex-husband -- though it was lovely, and all the more so because of the foot of snow that\u0027s greeted my return to New York. I\u0027m talking about the week I spent unplugged, away from email, social media and TV.Comments (16)Emma NicholsonBlogger, \"Hot Flashes of Inspiration\"Earlier this year, I turned 50. It was mostly a non-event as I\u0027ve been telling people I am 50 since I was 42. Adding years to your actual age always elicits a \u0027you look good for your age\u0027 response and I am not against shortening my life span for a compliment. But actually being 50 is turning out to have tons of unexpected benefits. Here are my top 10 reasons.Comments (21)Bernard-Henri LévyFrench philosopher and writerSince I began reading Philippe Sollers, I have witnessed the unfolding of four major \"periods\" in his work. I have a feeling that the work he published this week -- Médium, his 25th novel and one of the most lively, spirited works to emerge from this Mozart of letters -- marks the beginning of a fifth period.CommentsRana FloridaCEO, The Creative Class Group \u0026 Author, UpgradeThe goal of team members and colleagues is to add value, skills and expertise. Managers can and should enable and even unleash their people, but they cannot control them. I am not the boss of my team, but I am available for feedback and input.CommentsEric CooperFounder, President of the National Urban Alliance for Effective EducationFor the benefit of the nation, we must limit the use of testing and employ it strategically as a tool that can help students view learning with curiosity and frame their responsibilities as citizens of a great country.Comments (20)Janet TavakoliPresident, Tavakoli Structured FinanceThe growth of the U.S.\u0027s bigger and broader productive economy has been stunted by bad policies and bank bailouts benefiting rent-seeking financiers siphoning off an outsized percentage of the nation\u0027s gross domestic product (GDP).CommentsChristine BaderAuthor, forthcoming \"The Evolution of a Corporate Idealist: When Girl Meets Oil\"The question is not \u0027whether,\u0027 but \u0027when.\u0027 Assume that your company will get caught up in a crisis when you least expect it.CommentsNadia TolokonnikovaActivist, Pussy Riot band member\"They beat you once, then may come grab your hair, hit your head on the sewing machine or take you into a punishment cell, there they kick you using hands, legs, or remove the belt from a sewing machine and thrash you with it.\"Comments (31)Anne SinclairEditorial Director, Le Huffington PostThere is so much ineptness in a recent Newsweek article by Janine di Giovanni aimed at destroying France -- now a specialty of the magazine. \"French bashing\" is trendy again among Anglo-Saxons!Comments (18)Amb.
