While disputing the critique that its story choices skew left, it should make loud and clear its claim of exclusive authority to decide whether, where, how and when to publish content.Executive Director, First Amendment CoalitionI wonder if things would have been different if my brother could have talked about his illness more instead of being shamed or stigmatized because, through absolutely no fault of his own, he was burdened with a terrible, terrible disease.Student, Occidental CollegeThe cancellation of the meeting seems an indication, no matter what he and his campaign say, that Sanders knows the race is over and that he\u0027s lost.Queer Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostWhat is the primary thing that employers should change to improve retention and job satisfaction among women?

She writes one of the most tender, but most explicit love scenes I\u0027ve ever read. Along the way there are explorations of the meaning -- and pain -- of devotion to our art or passions, the importance of our senses, how we account for ourselves, and our impulses to keep secrets and to confess them.Culture Columnist, Huffington Post, CultureZohnI have lived with the reality of a premature death for more than four years. Today, I live with blackouts, blindness, convulsions and more. Aside from these horrific symptoms, I live in constant fear of even worse days that lie ahead. What crime did I commit to be forced to die this way?Former ChefTake the time to pause and open your mind to those things which you do not fully understand. You will be the better for it -- and, as your feelings of awe ripple out through acts of kindness, so will the rest of us.Based at the University of California, BerkeleyA Bloomberg report on Amazon Prime\u0027s delivery services showed that, in 27 metropolitan areas, same-day delivery is not an option for members living in some of the poorer and minority-concentrated, segregated neighborhoods.Noted international urban scholar from rural North Carolina, spokesman for racial and ethnic minorities, champion of health equity for allIt is our obligation to protect and to empower women, to end violence, including sexual violence, and to safeguard women\u0027s role in our societies. There can be no excuse for the appalling crimes of sexual violence. The UN has to show its strong commitment to ending impunity for violence against women and girls.Director General, UNESCOMake no mistake: your actions did in fact make light of the experience of sexual abuse victims. You made a parody and a spectacle out of what is a real-life, inescapable nightmare for thousands of people for your own personal gain.Professor of Law, University of Miami School of Law; Legislative \u0026 Tech Policy Director, Cyber Civil Rights InitiativeA CSX freight train derailed in Washington, D.C. last week.
