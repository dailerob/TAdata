{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Poor Scott McClellan. He must be feeling left out. While members of both parties keep popping up and calling for Karl Rove, Donald Rumsfeld, and even Vice President Cheney to resign, no one has mentioned Scottie. So, in the gentle spirit of this Thanksgiving weekend, let me step in: Scottie McClellan should step down. But not for the same reasons as Rove, Rummy and Cheney. I think Scottie should resign for Scottie\u0027s sake. I mean, just look at him. Day in and day out, being sent out with such ludicrous talking points, contradictory evasions, half-truths, non-sequitors, and outright lies -- it\u0027s hard to even watch him.Sunday morning I\u0027ll be on with Howard Kurtz and Glenn Reynolds on CNN\u0027s Reliable Sources discussing among other things, Bob Woodward, Andrew Sullivan, and the big business of blogging. 10 a.m. ET/7 a.m. PTREAD POST | comments (66)11.26.2005 Harry ShearerLarry grills famed Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward (click here for audio).
