{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, The American ProspectDemocrats should be enjoying a nice political windfall thanks to the Republicans\u0027 blunder on Medicare. But watch for the bipartisan Gang of Six to snatch defeat out of the jaws of victory. In the most likely budget compromise, the differences between the parties will collapse in a largely conservative direction.

I\u0027m sorry someone can stand on a stage and spew violent words, then issue an apology and go back to work. It\u0027s time for this hate to end.Read Post | CommentsJared Bernstein, 06.12.2011Senior Fellow, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesWhy hasn\u0027t the administration been able to do more on job creation?

It made me nostalgic for the days when $50 million was a big budget and when movies had their biggest single night on Saturday of their opening weekend.Read Post | CommentsChris Dodd and Robert Bennett, 06.12.2011All Americans, regardless of political affiliation, can agree that no child should ever die of a preventable, treatable illness simply because of where he or she is born. Yet each year, that is precisely what happens to millions of children without access to vaccines.Read Post | CommentsDavid Harris, 06.12.2011Executive Director, AJC; Senior Associate, St. Antony\u0027s College, Oxford UniversityIf a page is to be turned in the Arab world\u0027s most populous country, it cannot come at the expense of a vulnerable minority.

To advocate violence against anyone is disgusting, but against our most vulnerable youth -- it crosses the line.Read Post | CommentsJon Foreman, 06.12.2011Lead singer and guitarist of SwitchfootI\u0027ve found that true success has very little to do with income or comfort.

Wolfe, Attorney at Law, SeattleMore so than public squares -- which require a conscious set-aside of assembled space -- corners naturally result from crossroads, the elemental feature of travel between places.Read Post | CommentsRon Nyswaner, 06.11.2011Screenwriter, \"Philadelphia\"It seems to me that Tracy has channeled the anti-gay anger in our culture and is holding it up for us to examine. The things he said are merely more outrageous versions of homophobic beliefs that all of us live with -- and silently accept -- every day.Read Post | CommentsAndrew Reinbach, 06.12.2011JournalistEven when a conservative and I agree on a premise, we come to completely different conclusions. Why? My own guess is that conservatives\u0027 source for facts is the right wing media, a more or less alternate reality filled with alternate facts.Read Post | CommentsMeathead, 06.11.2011AmazingRibs.com, Barbecue Whisperer, Hedonism Evangelist, OmnivoreHow could innocent crunchy, delicious sprouts, full of nutrients and beneficial compounds, be dangerous?
