{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"APAPFrom the run up to Shock and Awe to last month\u0027s flurry of resolutions on Iraq, Barbara Boxer has been one of the most consistent critics of the war. So what is she doing heading up to Connecticut to stump for pro-war Joe Lieberman and against his anti-war challenger Ned Lamont? After all, Tailgunner Joe isn\u0027t just one of the staunchest supporters of the war, he\u0027s repeatedly and steadfastly spoken out against those who oppose it. Look, I understand the you-scratch-my-primary-run-and-I\u0027ll-scratch-yours ethos of sticking up for your fellow incumbent.
