{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"David CoatesWorrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsThe task before us in 2014 is nothing less than to find a route back to generalized prosperity amid the wreckage left in place by the collapse of the Reagan growth model and the rise of the globalized economy. The debate now underway about the relationship between full employment and income inequality is vital because progressives have to find -- and find quickly -- a set of economic policies that can credibly refute the sustained attempt by the GOP to take us back to the future. From conservative circles, we now face a coordinated campaign to intensify income inequality, to erode the welfare safety net, to undermine public services and to weaken still further already weak labor unions. For moral as well as for economic reasons, progressives have to challenge this conservative renaissance by developing a political program that explicitly and proudly combines job creation and inequality reduction, one that insists on greater income equality as the route to full employment.CommentsSteven StraussAdjunct Lecturer in Public Policy, Harvard Kennedy SchoolAmericans aren\u0027t looking forward to their new careers as \"micro-entrepreneurs.\" Being a \"micro-entrepreneur\" in this brave new world seems instead just a euphemism for being an employee, except with reduced compensation, job security, benefits and protections.Comments (182)Whitney BradleyMechanically-inclined and artistically skilled guyI\u0027m lost, suffocating in poverty, and I have a disability that is the primary cause of that. My credit is so bad I can\u0027t even get a cell phone contract. I work incredibly hard and I am incredibly skilled. But what I can\u0027t do is shake hands and make eye contact all day. And because of that I\u0027ve been homeless more than a few times.Comments (172)Jack MirkinsonMedia Editor, The Huffington PostIt hasn\u0027t been hard to see that morning news is getting gayer and gayer. But the confirmation by Robin Roberts of the widely assumed -- but rarely discussed -- fact that she is a lesbian in a long-term relationship is on another level entirely.Comments (37)Rep. Louise SlaughterU.S. Congresswoman from New York\u0027s 25th DistrictRight before they left for the holidays, Republicans in the House of Representatives left a lump of coal in the stockings of 1.3 million Americans. On Saturday, long-term unemployment benefits for those struggling Americans expired.Comments (41)Donna Rockwell, PsyDLicensed clinical psychologist, specialist in celebrity mental health, leading mindfulness meditation teacher, and activist in contemporary humanistic psychologyResolutions usually made in desperation become another excuse for guilt and self-denigration, another opportunity to feel like a failure. How can resolutions be a point of positive self-growth, instead, where we make them, and keep them, and benefit from their healing and restorative powers?CommentsBrian LeiterKarl N. Llewellyn Professor of Jurisprudence and Director of the Center for Law, Philosophy and Human Values at the University of ChicagoThe status quo in American legal education hummed along quite well for several decades -- most graduates of accredited law schools passed the bar, most found paid work as lawyers, and most fared far better, financially, than those who did not get law degrees. But two events in the last eight years unsettled the status quo, one familiar, one less so.CommentsJennifer BallMom, writer, teacher, lover of dirty martinis and yoga pantsHere are the things you need to stop saying if you are over the age of 30. Or if you have a mortgage, or a job that comes with benefits. Or if you have teens. Especially, if you have teens.Comments (587)Amy ChanRelationship \u0026 lifestyle columnist, founder of www.JustMyType.caThis year, instead of creating a new set of goals and resolutions, I\u0027ve decided to create a contract. This is a contract with myself, on the everyday behaviors and perspectives I can incorporate so I can grow -- so that I can be the best version of \"me,\" that I can be.CommentsSen. Bernie SandersIndependent U.S. Senator from VermontAs we survey our country at the end of 2013, I don\u0027t have to tell you about the crises we face. Many of you are experiencing them every day.Comments (67)Robert CreamerPolitical Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersThe coming year will determine whether progressives allow the obstructionist tactics of extremists and their billionaire allies to stop change that benefits the vast majority of ordinary Americans.Comments (120)David Katz, M.D.Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterResolutions, born of a \"ready or not, let\u0027s go\" mentality, invite failure. So reinvent your resolutions and make them more likely to succeed. Resolve to get ready, and go only when you are.CommentsMarlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistMy favorite New York tradition is the annual New Year\u0027s Eve ball-drop on Times Square. All around the globe, people are counting down in thousands of different languages as we bid goodbye to the departing year.CommentsMark RiddleExecutive Director, New Leaders CouncilRobertson\u0027s comments equating homosexuality to bestiality or implying African Americans were better off under Jim Crow laws are shameful, no doubt. But, what is even more startling is the almost instantaneous defense of Robertson by several prominent elected officials.CommentsDave TomarBlogger, Music Critic, Author of \"The Shadow Scholar\"Even if you haven\u0027t a clue what it means, Auld Lang Syne evokes an undeniable sentimentality, a disorienting nostalgia, an instantaneous affection for the people around you at that exact moment; loved ones and strangers alike. A New Year stands before you, brimming with possibility.CommentsSharda SekaranManaging Director of Communications, Drug Policy AllianceHere\u0027s looking back on racist drug war moments from the past year. Let\u0027s raise a glass of your beverage of choice (intoxicant or not) and hope that the prohibitionist madness will come closer to ending in 2014.CommentsDoug and Leslie GustafsonAuthors, Marriage CounselorsBe men who fight against the ripples and currents that hold back love. Who fight against the darkest shadows. Who create blueprints and music that flow from unrestrained hearts and end up touching the lives of those who know you. Especially your wives.CommentsAndrey TolokonnikovFather of Pussy Riot Band MemberI\u0027m sorry, but during the two years of harassment of the women from the punk band Pussy Riot, I finally lost faith in the Russian people and the hope that on this earth in Russia there will ever be something different. Nadia has not lost hope!CommentsJamin RaskinAmerican University Law Prof, MD State Senator, People For the American Way Senior FellowThe phony alibis for marriage discrimination have fallen away, and the Court\u0027s decision in United States v. Windsor leaves no doubt: gay people have an equal right to marry in the United States of America.CommentsChristopher RosenSenior entertainment editor, The Huffington PostThis is a film about a greedy king who built his empire on the desires and dreams of others. \"Everybody needs money,\" Danny DeVito says in David Mamet\u0027s Heist. \"That\u0027s why they call it money.\" Jordan Belfort might as well have that on his business card.Comments (20)Barbara HarmanPresident, Catalogue for Philanthropy: Greater Washington and Executive Director, Harman Family FoundationResearch shows that the poor give a greater percentage of their income to charity than the rich, and that they do so because they see before them on a daily basis just what real need really looks like.CommentsNate HoughtelingPartner and Executive Producer at Portal AAs we bask in the ubiquity of \"The Fox,\" \"Wrecking Ball,\" and \"The Harlem Shake,\" it\u0027s important to remember that there\u0027s so much more that happened on YouTube this year outside of the top 10.CommentsAnnabelle GurwitchAuthor, \u0027I See You Made an Effort: compliments, indignities and survival stories from the edge of 50\u0027Every year millions of Americans make resolutions. These are essentially to-do lists, most of which never stick, which is why each year I make a to-don\u0027t list. It\u0027s much easiest and more satisfying. By setting expectations low, I never let myself down, just like our government.CommentsPeter DreierE.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeThe same Republicans who slashed jobless benefits also recently cut food stamps, taking food out of the mouths of children, causing incredible and unnecessary suffering. This was not only callous and mean-spirited, it may also turn out to be politically stupid.Comments (85)David Palumbo-LiuLouise Hewlett Nixon Professor, Stanford UniversityThat the resolution has been so condemned by some without an understanding of these basic facts, upon which supporters voted for it, is regrettable and only shows the more the power of the prejudices to which even very smart people might be susceptible.CommentsKelechi EzieActress, writer, and singerI want married men to stop trolling single women like me in an attempt to feel relevant and appreciated again. Your wife just texted me -- neither of us appreciate you. Bonsoir.Comments (13)Bill SchneiderDistinguished Senior Fellow and Resident Scholar at Third WayIn the 21st century, cultural issues have displaced economic issues as the principal alignment in American politics. Economic issues matter, of course, but they no longer define partisanship the way they did in the 20th century: rich Republicans, poor Democrats.CommentsJames ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027The Middle East promises to be every bit as complicated and challenging to US policy-makers as it has been in the year just ending. There is a dizzying array of conflicts and crises unfolding across the region -- all of which will involve the US in the year to come.CommentsSara EckelAuthor, It’s Not You: 27 Wrong Reasons You’re SingleWhatever you end up doing on New Year\u0027s, there is often this sinking feeling that really you should be doing something else. That your true life -- the one that involves sipping great champagne, wearing an excellent dress and cracking wise with a bevy of smart, sexy singles -- is out there.CommentsRichard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureWhat a difference a year makes. Last year at this time, a president and a party who had just won an election with progressive rhetoric were quickly pivoting toward a \"Grand Bargain\" which would cut Social Security and Medicare. Today the forces of corporate consensus are on the defensive.Comments (21)Robert NaimanPolicy Director, Just Foreign PolicySpeaking as a Jewish atheist, I would like to take this opportunity to respond to the pope\u0027s appeal to me to make common cause with him for peace. A sus órdenes, Pope Francis. Count me in. The verdict of history has been decisive. Stalin was wrong.
