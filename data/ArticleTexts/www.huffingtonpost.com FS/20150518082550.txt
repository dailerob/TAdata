Certainly there are no winners.Sass \u0026 SensibilityAfter the dust-up between Obama and Netanyahu settles, we can expect to add even more steel to our commitment to protect Israel by adding more to its already vast store of sophisticated weapons. Thus, we take another step deeper into the tragedy of U.S. intervention in the Middle East that has become a noxious farce.Jeff Faux, author of The Servant EconomyWhat actually happens to those people who \"die\" and come back? And what can they tell us about the life that might awaits us after death, and the importance of life in the hear and now?Executive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostThe full range of debate about the Big Standardized Tests really comes down to answering two critical questions about the testing: Does the test collect good data?

King perform live or ever met him in person, yet I carry with me a lesson that he taught me many years ago.

But let\u0027s not let the present moment pass without acknowledging that those who were most focused on the future during the run-up to the war in Iraq were the ones working to stop it from happening.Editor, Eat the PressSuicide is not a happy topic but we need to hear about it and talk about.

Removing taboos and encouraging open conversation is a positive step. We need more articles about depression, not less.Distinguished Fellow, George Washington University’s School of Media and Public AffairsThe narrative playing out in the media and in state capitals across the country is that LGBT freedom advances only at the detriment of religious liberties, and vice versa.
