{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Stephen SchlesingerAuthor and Fellow at the Century FoundationObama has understood from the beginning that, in certain global situations, American power is severely limited. Despite the overwhelming US military arsenal, we cannot police the world as we wish -- unless we want to risk miring ourselves in new Iraqs and Afghanistans. Our best use of our power is to use our diplomatic skills to resolve disputes without resort to armed action. Obama is now trying to do this in Syria, Iran, North Korea, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and in Ukraine. Obama\u0027s pragmatism may sometimes seem too cautious or too \"small ball\" -- but, so far, over six years he has kept the peace, brought our troops back from Iraq and Afghanistan, and saved our country from wars in Syria, Iran and Ukraine. Not a terrible record after all.The situation in Nigeria has focused us on the plight of these abducted girls, but were we blind before to this possibility? It always takes a current event to snap us out of our collective fog, to clear away the cobwebs of our own inaction and make us take notice. What can we do to help them and to make our Mother\u0027s Day mean a little more?Jamie Lee CurtisActress and children\u0027s book authorWe\u0027ve accomplished storytelling on the silver screen and the latest Internet meme, but is the art of storytelling dead when it comes to complicated, politically charged issues like our environment and the need for swift action to combat climate change?Robert RedfordActor, director and environmental activistWe should be ashamed of the way we treat human rights standards right now and we should be ashamed at the way we treat our soldiers and veterans. We deserve better and we can do it with a united voice.Jack HealeyFounder, Human Rights Action CenterIf you give a bald little girl a wig to wear, you perpetuate the idea that her lack of hair is unacceptable to you and the rest of society. You train her to believe that she can\u0027t be pretty the way she is.Claire DinhStudent at Haverford CollegeSunday is Mother\u0027s Day, and there\u0027s no better time to join the movement to improve the health and well-being of mothers and babies everywhere. That\u0027s the goal of the Global Moms Relay. In partnership with the UN Foundation, Johnson \u0026 Johnson and BabyCenter, HuffPost is putting the spotlight on the ways we can bring new opportunities to women and children around the world.Arianna HuffingtonWe are taught to believe that everyone thinks the same way, that everyone is in control of their own mind, and that free will operates under their command. This is the paradox of living with a chronic and disabling thought disorder. We know differently. Everyone knows differently.Henry Boy JenkinsBlogger, BringChange2Mind.orgEvery once in a few years, a documentary about food captures the public\u0027s imagination and inspires people to make changes in their lives and in our food environment. The latest, and perhaps the most strategic, of these is Fed Up, the film about food industry\u0027s contribution to obesity.Michael F. JacobsonExecutive Director, Center for Science in the Public InterestToday, the country is at a tipping point. The most recent events in Bor and Bentiu are alarming. They bear all the troubling signs of a country drifting into a dangerous polarization of the conflict along ethnic lines which is about to spin out of control.Sean PennHilde JohnsonBrain health is not as hard as we make it, and a happier life is closer than most of us realize. The secret is not a mystery: A few better habits can lead to feeling a lot more comfortable in our own skin.Jon WortmannAuthorWhen I think about my mom, I wonder what a difference these relationships with a variety of other women across the globe might have made in her life. In our lives, too, my brothers\u0027 and sister\u0027s and mine. I know that it\u0027s had an immeasurably positive impact on my life.Meagan FrancisPublisher, TheHappiestHome.comThere\u0027s no legal limit to what you can be paid as a charter school operator. The only limits to your salary are the limits set by your own sense of shame. If you have no shame, then ka-ching, my friend. Ka. Ching.Peter GreeneTeacher, writerSince \"sleeping on the job\" has long been associated with laziness, I was terrified of being discovered. But because my afternoon naps had such an obvious positive effect on my ability to function in the later hours of the day, I made every effort to sneak them in.Liz WilkesFounder \u0026 CEO of ExubrancyIf today\u0027s Cosmo is \"capitalizing on the widespread interest\" in \"a buffet of light and heavy\" that now \"is an established formula for success,\" it\u0027s cashing in on a formula as inventive -- and traditional -- as the American women\u0027s magazine itself.Dr. Amy AronsonAssociate Professor, Fordham University and author, Taking Liberties: Early American Women’s Magazines and Their ReadersTea Party groups have evolved over time. Initially, they were supposed to be grassroots, libertarian, and spontaneous; but there were many who almost immediately attempted to grab the Tea Party mantle and turn it into their own giant political machine.Chris WeigantPolitical writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comBeing disillusioned with your life\u0027s path is a symptom, not a sickness. In other words, it\u0027s a sign of something much deeper that you have to address. You can\u0027t just throw money at universities and expect them to cure your life\u0027s woes.Kevin KleitchesEntrepreneur and lifestyle blogger, PeoplePassionate.comThere are so many gay men who treat other gay men with love and respect. I definitely want to acknowledge that. But we, as individual gay men, can make our lives and lives of other gay men even richer, pleasant, and vibrant by choosing our words wisely and speaking from the heart.Josh HershLife coach and entrepreneurGrowing up, in church we had the homily; at home it\u0027s what I call the \"momily\" -- the inspirational and instructive mom-isms that every family has. My mother Nancy Pelosi\u0027s momilies were memorable and still echo through the years from my childhood to my motherhood.Christine PelosiChair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusThe problem with traditional job skill training in many cases is that you can walk a horse to water but you can\u0027t make it drink. Far too many workers -- employed and unemployed -- don\u0027t seem interested in finding water on their own.Ira WolfeAuthor|Speaker|President, Success Performance SolutionsWe moms are used to temper tantrums and irrational behavior. We get it from our kids, we get it from elected officials and we get it from the right-wing media. (At least one of those groups will grow out of it, we tell ourselves.) That doesn\u0027t mean we\u0027re going to put up with it.Laura ReyesSecretary-Treasurer, AFSCMEThe Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations\u0027 decision to ban J Street demonstrates, if there was any doubt, that the Israel lobby is nearly identical to the gun lobby.MJ RosenbergBloggerAt 5:13 p.m. on April 19 this year, I was sitting in my car when I got a text message from Mir. Two years after our first hello, I had become Mir\u0027s producer for special shows he hosted when he came to Karachi. My phone pinged and the message read: \"I\u0027m attacked.\"Marium ChaudhrySenior producer for news and programming, Geo NewsIf the public does not see that people are directly benefiting from the program, support will erode and the program\u0027s future will be in doubt. Fortunately, the enrollment success and direct patient benefits of the ACA, makes it well-suited to build long-term public support. Unfortunately, not all public health care programs are on such solid footing.Howard DeanFormer Governor of Vermont and DNC Chairman, Democracy for America FounderMy mother died when I was 18 years old. We were just beginning to know each other as adults, finally leaving behind the drama of my adolescence and the tedium of childhood. Now that I\u0027m in my 30s, here\u0027s what I wish I could tell my mother.Claire Bidwell SmithLos Angeles-based grief therapist and author of the memoir \u0027The Rules of Inheritance\u0027As Washington increasingly comes to rely on the \"forward projection\" of military force to maintain its global position, the Fulbright Program may be the last vestige of an earlier, more democratic, equitable, and generous America that enjoyed a certain moral and intellectual standing in the world.Ann JonesAuthor, \u0027They Were Soldiers: How the Wounded Return From America’s Wars -- The Untold Story\u0027You don\u0027t really need to know much about me, except that I am a teenage girl, my mother was a teenage mom and I listen to Beyoncé (a lot). I wanted to take a little bit to speak with you about teen pregnancy.Rebekah BolserYouth activistI, maybe more than most people, can completely understand why broke white folks get pissed when the word \"privilege\" is thrown around. As a child I was constantly discriminated against because of my poverty, and those wounds still run deep. But luckily my college education introduced me to a more nuanced concept of privilege: intersectionality.Gina Crosley-CorcoranAuthor and advocate behind TheFeministBreeder.comA headline from a Capitol Hill newspaper declared that our current Congress could be the \"worst ever.\" Another said negotiating political agreements is a \"lost art.\" The whole country knows something is wrong with our government. It\u0027s time it\u0027s shown how to fix it, at least the U.S. Senate.Sen. Mike EnziU.S. Senator from WyomingI am suggesting that our spectrum is one in which there is nowhere where girls and women are not for sale. Some of us, depending on where we live and what we look like, are simply considered more valuable and expensive than others.Soraya ChemalyFeminist, Writer, Satirist... not always in that orderWe can only get married because millions of people took a stand to defend and protect us. The gay people of Brunei -- and Russia, and Uganda, and many other countries -- need us to take another stand today.Elton JohnDavid FurnishI\u0027m not just a \"paralyzed bride.\" I\u0027m Rachelle, a regular girl who had everything going for her when it all came crashing down. And my dear friend, who had only innocent intentions, is not just the girl who pushed me.Rachelle FriedmanBlogger; speaker; ambassador for the spinal cord injury communityGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"THAT\u0027LL BE 7 YEARS FOR THE BRUISE ON YOUR BREAST, MA\u0027AM",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
