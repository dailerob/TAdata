{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"You\u0027d think a ten-and-a-half year war would be a major issue in a presidential campaign -- especially a war going as badly as the one in Afghanistan.

Yet our response has largely been not to find better ways of connecting the dots, but rather simply to collect more dots.Read Post | CommentsClare Winterton, 04/02/12Executive Director, International Museum of WomenWhy is it that, in a world where almost every aspect of motherhood is discussed and dissected, the incredibly common reality of miscarriage is still so hidden? Why is the pain that so many women experience intensified by the sense that their experience is shameful or should be kept secret?Read Post | CommentsLarry Strauss, 04/04/12Veteran high school English teacher, basketball coach, novelistWe cannot begin to fix our education system until we get everyone in power to recognize the falseness of the military-corporate-education analogy, until we accept the absolute stupidity of executive-ruled schools.Read Post | CommentsVan Jones, 04/04/12President, RebuildtheDream.com; Author of NY Times bestseller, \u0027The Green-Collar Economy\u0027Today, April 4th, 2012, marks the 44th anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\u0027s assassination.

And yet -- I still don\u0027t know what it\u0027s like to be a person of color in America. It\u0027s never easy to talk about the ugly side of our society.
