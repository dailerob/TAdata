{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"APFrom nytimes.comFrom news.aol.comFrom jpost.comNed Lamont\u0027s historic victory over Joe Lieberman (only the fourth time in 26 years an incumbent Senator has lost a primary), and Lieberman\u0027s decision to run as an independent were the hottest topics on HuffPost this week. Don\u0027t miss the Lamont/Lieberman takes of Margaret Carlson, John Conyers, Stephen Schlesinger, Gabriel Rotello, Jane Hamsher, Eric Boehlert, Jayne Lyn Stahl, Rick Jacobs, Trey Ellis, RJ Eskow, Eric Alterman, and Taegan Goddard (Here\u0027s mine). For this week\u0027s developments in the Middle East, you\u0027ll want to read Tom McCarthy, Max Blumenthal, Suzanne Nossel, Eugene Jarecki, Deepak Chopra, Nina Burleigh, Kathleen Reardon, and Philip Slater. And be sure to check out this month\u0027s Contagious Festival. Plus, our Sunday Roundup below.READ POST08.08.2006 Joe ScarboroughThe conventional wisdom is that a Joe Leiberman loss will yank the Democratic Party so far left as to make other Democratic candidates unelectable this fall. The logic is laughable and similar to what I heard from Republican leaders in 1994.READ POST | comments (117)08.09.2006 Rep. John MurthaThe war in Iraq is the No. 1 issue in the country today. Americans are no longer willing to accept the human suffering or the financial toll of a war that has lasted for 3 ½ years with no end in sight.READ POST | comments (131)08.11.2006 Chris DurangFifty-five gay people in the army who are proficient in Arabic and you want them fired? Gosh, and here I thought you wanted to protect us all in your war on terror.READ POST | comments (29)08.10.2006 Harry ShearerTrying to answer the question, who are the terrorists?, should be the first step in deciding whether the advocates for a more \"muscular\" Middle East policy should finally be replaced by the advocates of a more brainy one.READ POST | comments (19)08.10.2006 Lawrence O\u0027DonnellBy late September, Bill Clinton will be onstage hugging his new best friend and starring in Lamont commercials.READ POST | comments (138)08.07.2006 Timothy NaftaliIf the US is seen to be supporting an Israeli occupation of even one inch of Lebanon, our ability to effect change in the region will sink even lower than it is now, the recruitment of new terrorists will be made even easier and our troops will be in even greater jeopardy in Iraq.READ POST | comments (31)08.08.2006 Simon JenkinsI could analyse, champion and condemn events and players in the Middle East to my heart\u0027s content. The form in which Israel was created and has been sustained was always going to ensure half a century of bloodshed, but nothing is going to change history.READ POST | comments (49)08.08.2006 Marty KaplanChris Matthews to Ned Lamont on MSNBC Tues: What do you think of the pajamahadeen? Lamont: Huh? Matthews: The bloggers.READ POST | comments (44)08.07.2006 Jill SobuleI thought of a funny political song where Mel Gibson has to do a remake of Yentl (in the Mandy Patinkin role), but instead I wrote a depressing angry old timey anti-war song.READ POST | comments (27)08.07.2006 Norm OrnsteinThe United Nations Interim Forces in Lebanon are not a full-blown army, but their presence right next to Hezbollah\u0027s military installation spoke volumes about their meaninglessness.READ POST | comments (74)08.10.2006 Arianna HuffingtonIf Democrats can\u0027t effectively repudiate the GOP\u0027s fear-mongering strategy of linking Iraq to national security, they can kiss 2006 -- and 2008 -- good-bye.READ POST | comments (189)John ZogbyDavid SirotaDavid MametToby BarlowJerry and Joe LongEarl Ofari HutchinsonRobert ScheerSusan MadrakDonnie FowlerAPAPAPFrom images.amazon.comAPLogin to Huffington Post  |  Make Huff Post your Home Page  |  RSS/XML  |  Sitemap  |  JobsCopyright 2006 © HuffingtonPost.com, LLC   |  User Agreement  |  Privacy  |  Comment Policy  |  Powered by MovableType","h1":"",".title":"","h2":"One More Day: Israel Expands Offensive In Last Try For Victory...Sunday RoundupThe Better Way of Fighting TerrorismNew Orleans--the Books You Should and Shouldn\u0027t ReadMel Gibson Should Extract Big Head From Drunk Ass!Is This Chick Lit?
