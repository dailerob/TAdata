{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week\u0027s news spotlight was captured by the judiciary, with the Senate\u0027s confirmation of Elena Kagan as the Supreme Court\u0027s 112th justice (and fourth woman), and federal judge Vaughn Walker\u0027s decision overturning California\u0027s ban on same-sex marriage. His 136-page ruling landed with the force of history being made. It felt less like a legal finding than another milestone on the road to a more perfect union -- another step in the long journey that has included the Emancipation Proclamation, the 19th amendment, Brown v. Board of Education, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Those who continue to oppose same-sex marriage are not just standing against the right of gays and lesbians to marry -- they are standing against the inevitable. When the case makes its way to the Supreme Court, will John Roberts\u0027 court want to position itself as a roadblock in the way of historic inevitability?Read Post | CommentsDavid Bromwich, 08.07.2010Professor of Literature at YaleTo say America now acts as if we need a war may underrate the syndrome. We seem to require three wars at a given time: a war to be getting out of, a war we\u0027re in the middle of, and a war we aim to step into.Read Post | CommentsWyclef Jean, 08.05.2010Grammy-winning musician and founder of Yéle HaitiMy concern for my family was my primary thought as I was urged to seek the presidency of Haiti. But then I came to realize that I have to make this decision for them, especially for my daughter, as much as for myself and my country.Read Post | CommentsMichael R. Bloomberg, 08.03.2010108th Mayor of the City of New YorkThe World Trade Center Site will forever hold a special place in our City, in our hearts.

So why is Sarah Palin, who so rarely deals in policy fixes, so popular?Read Post | CommentsJosh Silver, 08.05.2010President, Free PressSince its beginnings, the Internet was a level playing field that allowed all content to move at the same speed, whether it\u0027s ABC News or your uncle\u0027s video blog. That\u0027s all about to change.Read Post | CommentsMelinda Gates, 08.06.2010Co-chair, the Bill and Melinda Gates FoundationRotavirus is the most common cause of severe diarrheal disease in children worldwide and is responsible for the deaths of more than 500,000 children each year. It doesn\u0027t have to be this way.Read Post | CommentsRussell Simmons, 08.04.2010Founder of GlobalGrind.comWe are a pluralistic society and this means we welcome all religions. Islam did not attack the World Trade Center on 9/11, sick and twisted men did. They did not only hijack four airplanes, but also hijacked a religion.Read Post | CommentsJimmy Carter and Kofi Annan, 08.03.2010Vaccines have saved the lives of millions of children around the world, and have the potential to save millions more as newer vaccines are developed and introduced. Yet we are at risk of losing many of these gains. Why is this?Read Post | CommentsRep. Luis Gutierrez, 08.04.2010CongressmanThe pro-life, pro-family Republicans are now pro-neonatal detention and deportation. It isn\u0027t enough to drive out the people not born here, now they want to drive out the ones that were.Read Post | CommentsAndy Borowitz, 08.05.2010Comedian and Host of PBS\u0027 \"Next Week\u0027s News\"\"Soon after marrying, most men stop hitting on women and start shopping for furniture,\" the author of a news study said. \"Scientifically speaking, how gay is that?\"Read Post | CommentsJanine R. Wedel and Linda Keenan, 08.05.2010There\u0027s taxpayer money going into the hands of the very people attacking U.S. troops and the contractors who risk their lives for a paycheck. 260 of those workers took that risk and lost over the last year, and their names will likely never be known.Read Post | CommentsJared Bernstein, 08.03.2010Chief Economist and Economic Policy Adviser to Vice President Joseph BidenTwo Republican senators have released a third report critiquing 100 Recovery Act projects. And just like the last two, this one was an inaccurate and misleading attack on programs that are putting Americans to work.Read Post | CommentsRichard Trumka, 08.06.2010President, AFL-CIOWe do not have an immediate deficit crisis. We have an immediate jobs crisis. We cannot hope to shrink the deficit if the economy fails to grow or create jobs -- or worse, if it falls back into a double-dip recession.Read Post | CommentsBob Cesca, 08.04.2010Host of the Bob and Elvis ShowThe press, government officials and BP pitchmen are insulting our intelligence by suggesting that the oil has vanished and there\u0027s nothing to worry about.
