{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AriannaThere is some cool, creative stuff showing up on The Blog. Don’t miss the revealing voice mail message posted by Max Blumenthal, the funny screen shot grabbed by Ze Frank, and another round in the Lampley-York Smackdown. While on our Featured Post scroll, Kid Notorious, Robert Evans, shows himself to be a NBB (Natural Born Blogger), Mike McCurry silences the DC buzz, and Paul Rieckhoff goes ballistic over the travesty of U.S. troops being outfitted with faulty combat vests.05.11.2005 David MametI have just heard that John Simon has been fired from the post he long disgraced at New York Magazine. In his departure he accomplishes that which during his tenure eluded him: he has finally done something for the American Theatre.Author Bio | permalink05.11.2005 Mike McCurryFour million children die each year around the world within one week of being born. Three million of them could be saved if they had proper sanitation, clean water, nutrition. Simple things.Read whole post.Author Bio | permalink05.11.2005 Deborah RappaportIn the six months since the Presidential election, progressive Democrats have held countless retreats, conferences, convenings, strategy sessions, and conference calls—all with the goal, either stated or implied, of figuring out what went wrong and how to fix it. If the people and organizations that were responsible for what went wrong knew how to fix it, it probably wouldn’t be broken in the first place.Read whole post.Author Bio | permalink05.11.2005 Jon Robin BaitzThe theatre is about actors taking pauses to collect themselves, and funny makeup and the sleight of hand magic of good lighting. It doesn’t take any money at all to do it. You can do it in your kitchen. So. I am thinking of Odets and the theatre, and how much I love it.Read whole post.Author Bio | permalink05.11.2005 Norm OrnsteinThe United Airlines default on its pensions has huge implications for Social Security reform, and for the general sense of economic insecurity in the country.Read whole post.Author Bio | permalink05.11.2005 Robert EvansTry a thing you haven’t done three times. Once, to get over the fear of doing it. Twice, to learn how to do it. And the third time, to figure out whether you like it or not.Read whole post.Author Bio | permalink05.11.2005 Danielle CrittendenAdmit it. Hollywood misses those halcyon days of the Clinton administration, when the Lincoln bedroom functioned as a luxury hotel suite for crusading celebrities. In the first term of the Bush administration I bumped into Bruce Willis over the M\u0026M bowl in the White House Mess: A happier looking man you could not imagine. Just wait until he told his pals what he’d said to the President! (“I think you really kick ass, sir.”)Read whole post.Author Bio | permalink05.11.2005 David ReesI stopped by the Carnegie Council this morning and asked if Larry David was ready to read my screenplay--AS I HAD BEEN PROMISED.Guess what Arianna? You were mistaken: Larry David doesn’t work at the Carnegie Council.So my screenplay remains unread. (It’s called \"Heritage Foundation’s Ultimate Energy Policy Adventure\": Think \"Revenge of the Nerds\" meets \"a bunch of bullshit underwritten by ExxonMobil.\")An unread screenplay? For this I agreed to blog?Read whole post.Author Bio | permalink05.11.2005 Harry EvansThere\u0027s a lot of hope in the air for peace in the Middle East. Forget it. All the talk of \"the road map to peace\" between Israel and the Palestinians is pure wind while the same sponsoring governments are also sponsoring hate.Read whole post.Author Bio | permalink05.11.2005 Paul KrassnerKurt Vonnegut, my favorite Luddite, occasionally sends something my way via snail-mail. For example, his idea for a bumper sticker: “Your Planet’s Immune System Is Trying to Get Rid of You.” So I’m taking the liberty of sharing his latest thought-provoking missive here in cyberspace:Author Bio | permalink05.11.2005 Paul RieckhoffI say Mr. Rumsfeld does what all good tactical leaders should do and lead from the front. He should take his happy ass over to Fallujah, don one of the vests in question, and walk outside the wire on a few patrols. He will finally be among the troops for more than a photo op.Then we’ll see how confident Mr. Rumsfeld is about the Pentagon\u0027s ability to properly equip and field our men and women in uniform.Read whole post.Author Bio | permalink05.11.2005 Hilary RosenMany have wondered what it would take for Mary Cheney, daughter turned campaign operative, to speak up about her life. It turns out it\u0027s a million dollars.Read whole post.Author Bio | permalink05.11.2005 John ZogbyThe GOP may very well lose on personal accounts, on John Bolton\u0027s nomination, and on the so-called nuclear option to get up and down votes on judicial nominees. But what are the Democrats offering to the American people? Where is their plan? They are merely reactive. The Republicans produce the ideas, the Democrats merely react by saying no.Read whole post.Author Bio | permalink05.11.2005 Cory BookerThe grave urgencies facing us do not simply lie in fighting terrorism abroad but also in ensuring that our children - all of our children - can grow strong, talented, and hopeful in this land that we love.Read whole post.Author Bio | permalink05.11.2005 Harry ShearerI have no intention of competing with Mickey Kaus in the Bash CNN Prexy Johnathan Klein Derby. Kaus has lapped the field. But Klein seems to be on a mission to make himself risible. Fresh from a contentious interview with On the Media\u0027s Brooke Gladstone, he gives an upbeat assessment of CNN\u0027s primetime lineup to the subscription-only site Newsblues.com, which includes these nuggets: \u0027At 7, says Klein, Anderson Cooper \"is having a lot of fun. He\u0027s not worrying so much about the voice of his show. He realizes he\u0027s the voice of his show.\" And at 10, Aaron Brown \"has been very flexible in thinking freshly about the show. It shows in his delivery, carriage, demeanor. He\u0027s having fun.\"\u0027Anderson\u0027s having a lot of fun. Aaron\u0027s just having fun. Aaron clearly has to work on his fun skills.Posted at 03:31 PM | Author Bio | permalink","h1":"",".title":"","h2":"On The Blog NowRe: John SimonD.C.
