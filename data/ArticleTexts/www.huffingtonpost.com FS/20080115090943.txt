Edwards is closest to being on the right track.Read Post | CommentsBIOKristen Breitweiser, 01.14.2008Why don\u0027t Clinton and Obama both do something so out-of-the-box and head turning that it would virtually guarantee the White House to the Democrats in 08?Read Post | Comments (264)BIOEarl Ofari Hutchinson, 01.14.2008If Hillary could be faulted for anything it\u0027s that she didn\u0027t go far enough.Read Post | Comments (298)BIOJohn McQuaid, 01.14.2008In contrast to The Wire\u0027s amazingly cool, disciplined eye for every other aspect of urban society, this plotline has so far been the worst possible thing for a drama, both preachy and sentimental.Read Post | CommentsBIOArianna Huffington, 01.11.2008If enough of us refuse to answer pollsters\u0027 questions, their data will become so unreliable even the media would have to admit it was useless.
