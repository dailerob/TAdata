It\u0027s a movie about social networking born out of a fundamental disconnect. Social networking is here to stay, and it\u0027s not just about Facebook. At a time when we need to have deeper, more serious conversations across the country about the irrevocable impact of social networking in our lives, we have a movie that purports to be about social networking but ultimately proves to be a mostly fleeting distraction. See it; you probably will.

It\u0027s un-American. It\u0027s socialistic. It\u0027s an insult to democracy.Read Post | CommentsStephen Schlesinger, 10.01.2010Author and Fellow at the Century FoundationThere may be a dim, but brightening, beacon, at the end of the Afghan tunnel.
