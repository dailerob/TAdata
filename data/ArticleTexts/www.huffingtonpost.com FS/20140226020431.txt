Against this backdrop, the GOP, by choice, is offering nothing but attacks on the ACA, scandal-mongering on Benghazi and IRS missteps and a roadblock against any fiscal initiative that would improve the economy and put the many unemployed, under-employed and out of the labor force to work.Comments (80)Oliver LuckettFounder and CEO, theAudienceMy eyes hurt from doing nothing but staring at screen after screen all day -- from my laptop to my desktop screen to my iPhone and my iPad, TV screens, movie screens, I realized I was always staring at something other than the world.CommentsBob CescaManaging Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowIgnoring the crazies is not unlike ignoring a suspicious mole. It might make you feel better to not worry about it, but it won\u0027t keep it from ballooning into something serious. And yes, I just compared Ted Nugent to skin cancer. With apologies to skin cancer.Comments (41)Noah MichelsonExecutive Editor, HuffPost Gay VoicesAfter reading your stunningly bratty \"as told to\" New York Magazine tirade where you threatened to leave behind public life because you\u0027ve been so maligned by the queer community, there are a few things I want you to know.Comments (129)Mark GongloffChief financial writer, The Huffington PostThe unregulated digital currency beloved by techies, libertarians and the Winklevoss twins is having a crisis moment that could end its hopes to ever be accepted as a legitimate currency.Comments (94)John Kerry and William HagueWe see it especially in Goma, where one of us met in a hospital with young women so damaged by rape that they required surgery. And we see it in Syria today, where rape is being used as a tool of oppression. So is this personal to us? You bet.CommentsCC GoldwaterProducer of the documentary \u0027Mr. Conservative: Goldwater on Goldwater\u0027My grandfather was one of the first politicians to support gays serving openly in the military, and was known for being pro-choice and pro-immigration. But the current crop of Arizona Republicans has forgotten his policies and replaced them with the policies of divide and conquer.CommentsJill KrauseStory teller and moment hunter at BabyRabies.comIf you are a Stay At Home Parent who can manage to care for your children, your house, and your appearance all in an 8-hour work day, I applaud you. But please, do not assume for one second that the parent who can\u0027t take on all these extra roles is somehow failing.Comments (51)Rob JohnsonExecutive Director, Institute for New Economic ThinkingMany state and local governments are struggling to meet their obligations to retirees, and the easiest explanation is that workers are overpaid and their pensions are unaffordable. But the evidence suggests that the pensions crisis is both less pervasive and more complex than that.CommentsAllison HudsonBlogger, www.itsalushlife.comWe were all kids at one time who had big dreams. None of us grew up thinking it would be fun to struggle with addiction. But the thing is, you don\u0027t see it coming. And by the time you do it\u0027s usually too late.CommentsWait But Whywww.waitbutwhy.comGiven that the choice of life partner is by far the most important thing in life to get right, how is it possible that so many good, smart, otherwise-logical people end up getting it so wrong?Comments (12)Brian Levin, J.D.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityWhile there is good news in a reduction in the number of hate groups, those that remain may very well be more dangerous as a sustained core of more radicalized adherents sticks around.CommentsDean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Now that the talk of death panels and other craziness about Obamacare has faded away, people are looking more seriously at what the program actually will do. A major part of the story is that Obamacare will allow people to get health care outside of the workplace.Comments (197)Jon NegroniPublic relations writer and professional bloggerIt all started with a hat. Several months ago, one of my anonymous Pixar Theory Interns came to me with a crazy proposition: Andy\u0027s mom is Emily, Jessie\u0027s previous owner. For some time, I compiled all of the evidence and found some incredible support for this theory.Comments (50)Kirsten HaglundAmbassador for the National Eating Disorders Association and Miss America 2008Eating disorders happen behind closed doors. Signs are frequently overlooked (particularly among minorities), even by medical professionals... until the damage is undeniable.CommentsMiles MogulescuEntertainment attorney, writer and political activistIf you watched the Winter Olympics on NBC TV the past two weeks, it\u0027s hard to have missed the Cadillac ELR commercial which was almost as ubiquitous as figure skating. What\u0027s wrong with this commercial? Let me count the ways.Comments (19)Literally, DarlingOnline magazine for twenty-something womenI am blessed to be friends with some amazing and strikingly beautiful women. I go out with them and I feel the notion from men that I am simply an obstacle to keep distracted while they hit on my more attractive counterparts. So I\u0027ve accepted it.CommentsMatt SteelSt. Louis-based creative director, designer, poet, surfer, fatherBy all means, be careful when spending your hard-earned cash; but spend your time with ruthless discernment. The world has great need for your best work, words and wisdom. It has no need for wasteful or addictive habits.CommentsRev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkIt\u0027s sometimes hard to believe that the year is 2014. For all of our advances, tech developments, innovations, achievements and progress, we are watching elected officials enact laws and propose others that are simply unbelievable.Comments (20)Tavis SmileyPBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorTonight on PBS, I\u0027m joined by film, television, stage actor and co-star of The Blacklist, Harry Lennix.CommentsRomila “Dr. Romie” Mushtaq, MDNeurologist with expertise in the field of mind-body medicineIn the United States, there is no governing body overseeing the life coach training industry. People can claim to be a life coach but may have done so by watching videos or reading self-help books.CommentsMichelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesWhile we\u0027re hopefully beating back this law in Arizona, with anti-gay forces claiming it\u0027s about religious freedom and not about discrimination, keep in mind that their goal is to see homosexuality criminalized and punished around the world.CommentsAdam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911Apple fans had a nice run, but it\u0027s time to face the fact that perhaps the only thing standing between most of us and a successful targeted cyberattack is our own behavior, not our operating systems.CommentsL. Susan ZhangHealthcare technology analyst, modern girlGrowing up I was poor. I\u0027m 28 now and I recognize my childhood taught me a lot about what is necessary and what isn\u0027t.CommentsLinda StoneWriter, speaker and consultantWhat if I told you that the way we are talking about attention is part of the problem? Our conversation about distraction, multitasking, and the stern command to focus, actually creates a level of stress, anxiety, and shame.CommentsAdam GrantWharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027The Internet has cracked down on kleptomnesia and intentional plagiarism. Now, online tools can instantly crawl through millions of records to see if your writing is authentically yours. Yet the digital era has opened the door for a third kind of plagiarism.CommentsAlon Ben-MeirSenior Fellow, NYU\u0027s Center for Global AffairsThere are two intertwined implications for the Gulf States and Israel in particular that a nuclear Iran presents: the physical and the psychological. Whereas Iran\u0027s physical possession of nuclear weapons can be neutralized through deterrence and containment, the psychological aspect will linger as it will constantly bear a high degree of uncertainty.CommentsMichael KeeganPresident, People For the American WayTed Nugent isn\u0027t a Greg Abbott gaffe. His presence on the Abbott campaign trail represents a deliberate effort to cultivate the most extreme elements of the Republican base.CommentsAlex KimCommunications marketer, 500pxOutside visitors are allowed to visit North Korea, their visits categorized into different streams: journalism, charity, tourism, family reconnection.
