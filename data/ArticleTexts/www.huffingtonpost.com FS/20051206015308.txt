{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"APReuters/Jay JannerToday\u0027s Meet the Press was a pretty dispiriting affair. And not just because it was, well, Meet the Press. The marquee guest was John McCain. Or, should I say, \"John McCain.\" The guy who showed up looked like McCain, but didn\u0027t sound like McCain. What made the experience all that much stranger for me is that right after watching the show, I had breakfast with McCain\u0027s campaign finance reform partner, Senator Russ Feingold, whose fearless assessment of the reality in Iraq made it even clearer that the Straight Talk Express has gone seriously off the road. And the weirdest part was Russert\u0027s refusal to acknowledge any of it. The whole show had a surreal, subdued, almost underwater quality. You got the feeling that McCain knew the stuff coming out of his mouth -- \"the president has done a good job\" -- was absurd, and you kept waiting for Russert to ask: \"But wait a minute, aren\u0027t you John McCain?

The second is that the agenda abandons the principle of concentration.
