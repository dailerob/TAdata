{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Director, Earth Institute at Columbia UniversityTo overcome an economic crisis, the creditor must be smart and measured. It is right to demand strong reforms of a mismanaged debtor government; but if the debtor is pushed too hard, it is the society that breaks, leading to instability, violence, coups, and pervasive human suffering. While the debtor loses the most, the creditors also lose, as they are not repaid. The formula for success is to match reforms with debt relief, in line with the real needs of the economy. A smart creditor of Greece would ask some serious and probing questions. How can we help Greece to get credit moving again within the banking system? How can we help Greece to spur exports? What is needed to promote the rapid growth of small and medium-size Greek enterprises? For five years now, Germany has not asked these questions.By departing from tradition and becoming more inclusive and less doctrinaire, the court has deprived itself of any brakes that might stop the train it has set in motion. Many will think this is a good thing. The question Scalia and the other dissenters raise is whether it is a legal good thing.Davidson-Kahn Distinguished University Professor and Professor of Law at Florida International UniversitySkewed media coverage can cause policymakers and members of the American public to draw erroneous conclusions. If you genuinely want to understand why Puerto Rico is mired in a crisis, but you disregard or downplay the lack of political and civil rights in the territory, then you are missing a core point.Resident Commissioner, Puerto RicoMany people, including many student debt holders, may be surprised to learn that people can be pursued for student debt even into their elder years. In fact, the government is withholding Social Security payments for some retirees, because their student loans have not been fully repaid.Senior Fellow, Advanced Leadership Initiative, Harvard University. Co-founder, National Student Debt Jubilee ProjectSenior Fellow, Advanced Leadership Initiative, Harvard University. Co-Founder and President Emeritus, Presidio Graduate SchoolCo-Director, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureBy allowing the religiously-affiliated troops to still ban gay adults, the BSA is making a religious exemption seem like a reasonable compromise when in fact it is allowing the very people who would discriminate to keep discriminating.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostMy brother died in a car crash when he was 18 and my family never really recovered from it. I can\u0027t begin to imagine the Prescott family\u0027s pain. We live in a world that makes it very, very difficult to be trans.Public speaker, activist, OlympianIt\u0027s thoroughly obvious why this photo of Dick Cheney went absolutely viral the other day. For the left-leaning, it presents the ultimate opportunity to hate on Darth Vadar for being so callous. And for the right, the nonchalance is cowboy fuel for biding one\u0027s time before retaliating with vengeance.Publisher of the visual politics and media literacy site, BagNewsNotesI am an Eagle Scout, and I am the Scoutmaster of Troop 179 in Springfield, OR, and I happen to be gay. For the first time in my 18 years in scouting, I can truly be myself.United Methodist Pastor in Training, Scoutmaster of Troop 179 in Springfield, ORDon\u0027t sweat the July nuclear accord between the United States and Iran. There are two crucial points to take away from all the angry chatter to come: first, none of this matters and second, the devil is not in the details, though he may indeed appear on those Sunday talk shows.Author of \"Ghosts of Tom Joad: A Story of the #99Percent\" and \"We Meant Well\"Unless you\u0027re purposely trying to be alone, or on a deserted island, the chances of you actually being alone when you travel solo are quite skinny.Travel Blogger, MyLifesaMovie.com | Instagram: @mylifesatravelmovieWhen such a man, a noted \"radical Republican,\" who is \"anti-abortion and anti-feminist,\" shoots up a theater full of women at an Amy Schumer movie, his motive should hardly remain a mystery. Houser\u0027s insistence on making public statements regarding his hatred of women is well-documented.Freelance Writer and AuthorPuerto Rico is on its way to one of the largest debt defaults in history, right up there with Greece and Argentina. If you want to know what\u0027s happening in Puerto Rico, Anne Kruger is where you must start.CEO, Professional Investor and Chairman, Intelligence Squared U.S. DebatesOur fear of offending, of not doing the right thing, of being misunderstood or considered not \"fun,\" not \"game,\" or not a \"good team player\", that fear is greater than our fear of pain. Of being violated. Of conceding where we don\u0027t want to concede. Of being overpowered.Sass \u0026 SensibilityAt some point, a scientist must say it is time to stop waffling so much and say that the evidence is pretty strong. In my opinion, we have reached that point on the sea level issue. We have a global crisis, an emergency that calls for global cooperation to reduce emissions as rapidly as practical.ClimatologistSocial Security demonstrates that public systems are often better than their private counterparts -- more transparency, fewer middlemen, less opportunism. The problem is that government-managed systems are only as good as their stewards, and one of our two major parties hates government.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027If you were to believe some reactions, all women who become mothers are doomed to live the rest of their sad little lives, fat, hairy and exhausted. That is, if you\u0027re doing a \"good\" job. And apparently it is other moms who determine what \"good\" really is.JournalistNo one I knew ever trusted the police. We never believed that they were there to protect and serve us. This became abundantly clear when I was 14 years old.Executive Director of SisterSong, the National Women of Color Reproductive Justice CollectiveWhen Fox News announced that they would be limiting the number of candidates invited to their debate to only the top ten in polling, it was inevitable that there would be a struggle to get on the main stage. But there will also be a \"consolation prize\" debate earlier in the day, which will feature those who didn\u0027t make the cut.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comDear fellow white feminists, we need to talk about Sandra Bland. More specifically, we need to talk about why we aren\u0027t talking about Sandra Bland.Producer, HuffPost LivePuerto Rico\u0027s economic crisis is nothing to laugh about. Drawing comparisons to Greece and Detroit could be illustrative, but the context of Puerto Rico\u0027s case is far different. Neither Detroit nor Greece has a state monopoly over energy responsible for a significant portion of their debt.Consultant, WriterFor dogs, most breeds are considered seniors once they reach eight years of age. Veterinary care of senior and geriatric dogs has made big advances in just the last decade, so there\u0027s no reason that your dog can\u0027t live a long, happy, comfortable life.Best-selling author, public speaker, and the internationally acclaimed star of “Cesar 911\" on Nat Geo WILD.I don\u0027t want to be around your kids. (I often don\u0027t want to be around my kid!) I\u0027ll tolerate them, and if they\u0027re acting up, I\u0027ll even empathize with what you\u0027re going through because I\u0027ve been through it myself, but that doesn\u0027t mean I\u0027ll be happy about itBlogger, DadandBuried.comI\u0027m a thin mom who loves to move my body, who loves to eat healthy food and have a glass of wine and some dark chocolate every night, who loves to sit on the front porch with my husband after the kids go to bed, who loves to read, who loves my children---who, frankly, is a person beyond my physical exterior, and I recognize this.Writing, blogging, hoppy ale drinking, stay-at-home-yoga mama machine. Author of The Best Day of Your Life.It would be a mistake to diminish their tweets to a \"catfight,\" which conjures the image of two thirteen-year-old girls fighting over a boy, not two serious artists discussing their careers.M.Phil. Student, University of OxfordSlowly I started the feeling the prejudice. In my infant child for my spouse and in my spouse for my child. But I chose not to understand why. \"I didn\u0027t say anything,\" I would say repeatedly, frustrated and furious. And I would spend long hours in the deserted after-work cafeteria with staring at my screen, my eyes filling up with tears.Engineer, Writer, Artist, ActivistWordsmith, photo nerd, sitcom junkie, dog lover, and Editor at 500px. Everything I ever needed to know I learned from Calvin and Hobbes.Whether it\u0027s paired with wine or melted over a burger, cheese is where it\u0027s at. And not just because eating it makes life worth living.Details MagazineScreen time isn\u0027t intrinsically evil -- and there are clearly lots of ways we can use technology to educate and engage children. But as we explore all its possibilities, it\u0027s really important that we make sure that technology doesn\u0027t stop our children, especially our youngest children, from interacting with people -- and the world around them.Pediatrician, Boston Children\u0027s Hospital, Harvard Medical SchoolYou can see that crisis of understanding taking place in American politics, and it applies to those who cover it just as much as it applies to the elected officials they cover. They all seem to be saying, \"how can this guy be doing so well? Everything we know about politics tells us he can\u0027t.\"Writer, thinker, musician.Symbols are powerful, and furling the Confederate battle flag was an important gesture. But symbolic gestures are no substitute for substance. I hope the Legislature will codify the stipulations the state made to the court in order for it to uphold the state\u0027s voter identification law.Representing South Carolina’s 6th Congressional DistrictSo your dinner plans fell through and it looks like you\u0027ll be eating solo.
