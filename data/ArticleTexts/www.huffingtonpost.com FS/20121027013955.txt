{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupPresidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton are turning into the most watchable buddy-buddy road show since \"Starsky and Hutch.\" All they\u0027re missing are platform shoes and a Gran Torino. Next week they will travel together to Florida, Ohio and Virginia, as Clinton tries to infuse his explanatory magic into Obama\u0027s campaign-trail pitch in the final days of a grueling 2012 race. But as attention turns -- even before Election Day -- to the dreaded \"fiscal cliff\" looming at year\u0027s end, it\u0027s becoming clear that Clinton\u0027s sidekick duties will not be over on November 6 if Obama wins. If the current president gets the chance to try to fashion a post-election deal, he\u0027ll need Clinton\u0027s help in selling it to fellow Democrats.Read Post | Comments (1,089)Mark Cuban, 10/25/12Owner, Dallas Mavericks; Chairman, HDNetThere is no greater opportunity than here in America.

Years are already a bit blurry, and decades were mostly beyond the limits of consideration for most of human history. And our reaction to perils in the modern world remains bounded by this biology -- if we let it.Read Post | CommentsSoraya Chemaly, 10/26/12Feminist, Writer, Satirist... not always in that orderRemember facts? Remember facts about rape? Because it turns out that a whole lot of people know less than nothing about the subject. Indeed what they think they know is a whole lot of something that is wrong and dangerous to our heath, safety and well-being.Read Post | Comments (23)Robert Naiman, 10/26/12Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicyAlthough it was a great first step that Bob Schieffer even said the word \"drone\" and made Mitt Romney say it too, to let politicians merely answer the question at this level of abstraction -- \"I support drone strikes, too\" -- is to let them off the hook.Read Post | Comments (11)Paul Douglas, 10/25/12Chief Meteorologist, \"WeatherNation TV\"; Star Tribune\u0027s \"On Weather with Paul Douglas\"I\u0027m tracking Hurricane Sandy for our Alerts Broadcaster clients, but I wanted to share some of our thinking with HuffPost readers who may be personally impacted by Hurricane Sandy over the next 4-5 days.Read Post | Comments (24)Fred Goldring, 10/26/12Entrepreneur, Strategist, Musician \u0026 LawyerWe hope that our anthem will quickly inject into the public consciousness some sorely missing positivity, optimism, and emotional resonance in the final days before the election.Read Post | Comments (86)A.J.

Talbott, 10/26/12Author, \"Survival Investing: How to Prosper Amid Thieving Banks and Corrupt Governments\"There is no reason to assume the big banks will be around in the long run. Therefore, do not take comfort that your money is safe with them. If you have less than $250,000 in an FDIC insured deposit account, then at least you have the US standing behind the claim. But, otherwise, beware.Read Post | CommentsJohn Hewko and Jeffrey Sachs, 10/26/12Some people ask why we should spend hundreds of millions of dollars to finish the job on polio when there are so many other health priorities. The risk of rebound is one compelling reason. Yet there is another as well.
