{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Novelist and contributing opinion writerThe principal agent in pushing the Court to the right has been the Federalist Society, an organization founded in the 1980s, and for whom Antonin Scalia was perhaps the most visible proponent. The record shows that future Republican appointees will inevitably decide cases not on the basis of unbiased and dispassionate legal reasoning, but to advance the political and ideological preferences they were selected to uphold. To assert that this is merely a matter of \"judicial philosophy\" is to obfuscate the systematic and deliberate effort to transform the federal courts, packing them with political activists whose rulings are foreordained. And so with Scalia\u0027s death, the Supreme Court is at a final crossroads. As are Democrats who may feel tempted to walk away from their party\u0027s nominee, whether it be Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton.He said: \"I\u0027m sending up the Bat Signal for you. We miss you, we need you?--?the old you, the political you?--?especially now, as the nation faces nothing less than a crisis of democracy.\" She said: \"I\u0027m just talking about politics in a different way and from a different angle. This is certainly an unconventional election, and it needs more than conventional coverage.\"Author, \u0027Public Parts\u0027 and \u0027What Would Google Do?\u0027Author, \u0027Public Parts\u0027 and \u0027What Would Google Do?\u0027In Justice Scalia\u0027s case, we wonder if the sudden death in bed might have been due to sleep apnea, made worse by the combination of obesity, thinner air at high altitude, and possible use of alcohol, sleeping pills, or opiates.Professor of Psychiatry Emeritus, UCSD and co-Director of Research, Scripps Clinic Viterbi Family Sleep CenterThis whole \"having it all\" business has been grossly misinterpreted by our society at large. The purpose of all that bra burning back in the \u002760s was to give women choices. Doing all of it at the same time was never the idea.Print and radio reporter, co-host of Range PodcastThe Virginia Governor invited the NRA to the table, but not gun violence prevention experts, and it shows.Executive Director, Coalition to Stop Gun ViolenceDuring the U.S. occupation of Iraq, Hillary emerged as one of the administration\u0027s toughest critics. She used her position as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee to harshly question the disastrous Bush policy. She never flinched in her criticism. Not to acknowledge the full story of Hillary\u0027s record is to distort it.Retired AmbassadorIn the same way that soldiers in the U.S. Armed Forces gear up and wage war, so too must we social justice warriors gear up and wage peace. On December 2, 2015 I left the comforts of the Jersey Shore and traveled to Lesvos, Greece, the front line of the Muslim refugee crisis.Director, Educating For JusticeWhen someone commits a heinous criminal act, we always hope the punishment will match the offense.

Yet all too often that opportunity is being blown.The full spectrum of human relationships with drugsSecretary Clinton has flipped Sanders\u0027 claim around and challenged him to show where she has reversed a position to serve the moneyed interests.

No longer. And that\u0027s a huge problem for the rest of us.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027Why would anyone in his right mind favor \"sluggish\" Europe over \"vibrant\" America? If we focus on data rather than snappy sound bites, the attraction of the European model is clear.Economist, Educator and AuthorDear Mr. President, please appoint Elizabeth Warren to the Supreme Court before the end of the week. She\u0027s earned it. She deserves it. And she\u0027ll be so, so good at it.U.S. Congressman for Florida\u0027s 9th DistrictThe throw pillows on the sofa were slightly askew and needed to be fluffed and set at a pleasing angle. I found myself running back and forth in a desperate effort to create stylistic balance until I passed out on the boomerang table.Writer and lemonade-drinkerWhen presidential candidate Bernie Sanders talks about income inequality, and when other candidates speak about the minimum wage and food stamps, what are they really talking about? Whether they know it or not, it\u0027s something like this.Author of the forthcoming \"Hooper\u0027s War,\" \"Ghosts of Tom Joad: A Story of the #99Percent\" and \"We Meant Well\"To protect the next generation, maybe now it is time to look back to previous generations for the practical good sense that protected and saved lives. My great grandfather did it with cars and today we can all have a role in protecting our families and communities.Founder, Lesscancer.orgWithin minutes of the start of the hearing in the case against the five alleged masterminds of the September 11 terrorist attacks, Walid bin Attash, who\u0027s accused of helping to train the 9/11 hijackers, announced he doesn\u0027t trust his appointed lawyers and wants to communicate with the judge directly instead.Senior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstWhen I think about the bill before our state legislature, House Bill 1008, the feelings I had in high school come back to me.

I find myself at a loss for words, unable to accurately describe what is going on in the region I just left. But the fact is, we all need to do better to help each other.Student, Writer, FriendA climate conducive to learning has to have a balance between risk-taking and rule-following. That notion really resonates with me, because I see teaching as an ongoing balancing act. And some of that balance is between risk and rules.Teacher and writer; blogger, curmudgucation.blogspot.comImagine the Supreme Court deciding more than 100 cases without its full complement of nine Justices. Imagine this closely divided Court splitting 4-4 in many of those cases, meaning that it cannot issue a decision that provides binding law for the whole country.Chief Counsel, Constitutional Accountability CenterIt\u0027s labor, so everyone knows it\u0027s going to hurt, right? Wrong. Whatever our patients think it\u0027s going to be like, it\u0027s different.  And every time they think it can\u0027t get worse than this, they\u0027re surprised, because it does get worse than this. Registered nurse behind the blog Adventures of a Labor Nurse: the Highs and Lows of Labor and DeliveryTargeting Black, Brown, HIV positive, and queer bodies, laws regulating disclosure of personal information - specifically HIV - serve as a regulatory tactic to perpetuate stigma and fear.Community organizer and advocate for LGBTQ youth of color in the house and ball communityEducation is the key to make opportunity less serendipitous and more systemic for all of us.

I had advantages that women generations before me didn\u0027t have -- education, economic independence and, most importantly, I was able to exercise a right that until then wasn\u0027t available to women.Lawyer with the Law Offices of Amy Oppenheimer and a retired administrative law judge for the State of CaliforniaTake that trip to Lyon. Go to that underground music event none of your friends care about. Enjoy a nice dinner. And all those people you think are judging you... they likely are, given the stigma of doing things alone, but what does that matter in the grand scheme of things?Just another human. Thinking, exploring, creating, and hopefully inspiring.By embracing our inequalities we\u0027re that much more likely to get stuff done, to grow and achieve more.
