{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureSen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) just announced that fast-track trade legislation won\u0027t be introduced until April. Thanks to the objections of Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Oregon), the effort to fast-track fast track has been put on hold. Fast track -- \"Trade Promotion Authority\" -- is designed to grease the skids for passage of the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement that is still being negotiated behind closed doors. The postponement opens up a month to have a true national debate on our global trade tax policies. Surely one is long overdue. To aid in that debate, the Congressional Progressive Caucus has released its \"Principles for Trade: A Model for Global Progress,\" which shows that there could be an alternative to the TPP, a global strategy designed to benefit workers, not investors, and serve the nation\u0027s interests, not the special interests of global companies and banks. The CPC seeks more trade, but on terms that will strengthen, not sabotage, working families.To all of my precious students: My guess is that all of you will wonder why I am making you take these tests.

It evolved as a signal to get our attention and keep us out of trouble.Author and professor of psychology, Western Carolina UniversityThe people and police officers of Ferguson can ill afford to allow the difficult but necessary reform process that\u0027s now underway to be subsumed by petty politics. To plunge headlong into a dialogue defined by the same narrow, reductive, zero-sum talking points that frame so much of our national debate would be an inexcusable mistake.Writer; former chief speechwriter to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder; veteran of Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.Because insurers don\u0027t know which way the Supreme Court will rule come June, they reportedly are thinking of pricing their policies for 2016 based on the worst-case scenario of a plaintiffs\u0027 victory.
