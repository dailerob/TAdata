{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week began with \"The Horrible Call\" finally deflating \"Deflategate\" in a thrilling Super Bowl that ended up being the most-watched program in U.S. television history. Though Patriots rookie Malcolm Butler stole the main event, the halftime show\u0027s breakout star was Left Shark, Katy Perry\u0027s more-funny-than-fearsome, freelancing dancer. On Wednesday, the Obama administration scored big with FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler announcing strong net neutrality regulations, including \"enforceable, bright-line rules\" that would forbid Internet service providers from throttling connections or charging more for access to sites like Netflix. So now you won\u0027t have to pay through the nose to binge-watch the next season of House of Cards -- unless, of course, legislative loopholes are added during the sausage-making process, a la... House of Cards. Meanwhile, debate continues over Brian Williams and his personal \"fog of war\" -- though if the same level of skepticism and debate had been applied before the Iraq invasion, perhaps Williams, and the troops, wouldn\u0027t have been there in the first place.Some parents today are being swayed by misinformation that has caused them to delay or decline vaccinating their children, jeopardizing the health of many others. I want all people to know that immunizations are safe, and that they work.Former First LadyISIS be damned! I thought. But with the next breath I could only think that our own barbarians did not have to wait at any gate. They were insiders. Home grown. Godly. Our neighbors, friends, and kin. People like us.Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyIn Davos last month we announced \"What\u0027s Working,\" a global HuffPost editorial initiative to double down on our coverage of what\u0027s working. By shining a light on these stories, we hope that we can scale up these solutions and create a positive contagion. You\u0027ve heard of copycat crimes. We want What\u0027s Working to inspire copycat solutions.We now have an imperative to address expanding economic disparity and environmental hazards, which are adding fuel to geopolitical tensions around the world, and to reassess the role of business can play in improving the world for future generations.Chairman and CEO of SalesforceShamefully, the Court\u0027s systematic dismantling of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act and the Court\u0027s anticipated modification of the Fair Housing Act may cause it to be remembered by history as a strict constructionist Court with neither heart nor soul.Chief Executive Officer, The King CenterDoes anyone in their right mind think that any country would willingly put itself through what Greece has gone through, just to get a free ride from its creditors? If there is a moral hazard, it is on the part of the lenders -- especially in the private sector -- who have been bailed out repeatedly.Professor at Columbia University and a Nobel Laureate in Economics\"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,\" is as true today as it was when we heard our grandparents say it.Board-certified radiologist; Board member, Lesscancer; Author, \u0027A World Without Cancer\u0027These infants were counting on us, their herd, to provide them with community immunity until they were old enough to get vaccinated. It is not science\u0027s fault that these children, our fellow Americans, caught the measles. It is not their parents\u0027 fault. It is the fault of the anti-vaxxers.Pediatrician in Washington DC, member of the National Physicians AllianceOne in six children born today in the Democratic Republic of Congo won\u0027t live to see their fifth birthday. Since the outbreak of fighting in 1998 almost three million children have died here. Within these dire conditions I saw the extraordinary work of War Child and met children who, despite every element working against them, astonished me with their warmth, intelligence, determination and desire to learn and build a better life.Actress and War Child ambassadorSenator Cotton may prefer hell to Guantanamo for my clients, but what does he really know about either? What he knows is how to play politics -- a game where one thing is certain: the prisoners at Guantanamo always lose.Staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights in the Guantanamo Global Justice InitiativeThe king has died. Long live the king. Saudi Arabia today is a medieval system whose horrid human rights practices match its antiquated political system.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteThe rapid rise of measles of this year has highlighted the importance of vaccines. They are heralded as one of the top 10 successes of public health in the 20th century. So why do some people -- even some health care workers -- choose not to use them?Medical doctor, epidemiologist and journalist; Staff writer at The Dallas Morning News; Professor of public health at The University of Texas at DallasInstead of staying laser-focused on the very real, very complex and very dangerous consequences of the outcome of the negotiations with Iran, the public discourse is now being hijacked by politics.National Director, Anti-Defamation LeagueSo many children have lost ground as the trumped-up fear of excessive debt children did not cause has been used by some in Congress to cut safety net programs we know work.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundReal markets do exist. There are even real markets in fantasy objects like \"derivatives.\" People are engaged all the time in competitive buying and selling; we haggle and adjust, trade goods, money, and contracts. But the \"mainstream economist\" presupposes and proselytizes about something that purports to be more than that.Political theorist - Founding Director \"Civic Inquirer\" - author of \"Civic War and the Corruption of the Citizen\" \u0026 \"Abandoned To Ourselves\"The euphemism is the \"share\" economy. A more accurate term would be the \"share-the-scraps\" economy. New software technologies are allowing almost any job to be divided up into discrete tasks that can be parceled out to workers when they\u0027re needed, with pay determined by demand for that particular job at that particular moment.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027According to economist Lance Taylor and his colleagues, we\u0027re not yet talking about the kinds of major changes needed to keep us from becoming a Downton Abbey society.Author and cultural theoristA number of labels that originally signified progressive ideas continue to be (mis)appropriated, their radical potential drained away, with the result that they\u0027re now invoked by supporters of \"bunch o\u0027 facts\" teaching or a corporate-styled, standards-and-testing model of school reform.Education expertI am not a scientist. I am not smart enough for that. But I am a mother. And although I am not really smart enough for that either, I do know autism from that angle. I know the rigidity and the obsessiveness and the rage over having an aide in school. I know the quiet longing that comes with being different or weird, because I see it every single day.WriterThere is value in recognizing that, far from wanting to sustain the U.S. in its global policing role, we would do better to welcome the emergence of a new multipolar world, to recognize our limits within that emerging multipolar world, and to begin to live within those limits.Worrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsHopefully Ashton Carter, President Obama\u0027s nominee for Secretary of Defense, will make a strong commitment to closing down Guantanamo before the end of President Obama\u0027s term. His confirmation hearing will be a key indicator of how committed he is to this goal.Senior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstAs approval of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline appears to be resting on extremely thin ice, TransCanada on Wednesday announced they would be entering the oil-by-rail business to help further their tar sands investments.California Philanthropist \u0026 Climate ChampionTo fight ideological extremism in the Middle East the main starting point must be youth. It is vitally important that Arab/Muslim youth are given satisfactory answers to their economic, community and spiritual needs. The challenge is difficult and there are no magic solutions.Palestinian journalistFor me, health is a little less undeviating. There are times when I\u0027ll do a two-day juice cleanse, feel great, and then have an In N Out hamburger for breakfast the next morning.Actress, known for role as Sam Puckett on the Nickelodeon series \"iCarly\" and \"Sam \u0026 Cat\"Instead of spending their mega-fortunes on luxury hiding places to escape the mob, better to use that money to improve the conditions that have the populace thinking about tar and feathers or worse.Senior writer, Moyers \u0026 Company on public TV. Senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.The announcement of the restoration of relations between Cuba and the United States has provoked a resurgence in this country of a feeling lost for decades: hope. However, the expectations that have been created are so high and so difficult to meet in the short-term that many may feel disappointed.Award-winning Cuban bloggerHillary Clinton served on the board of directors of Walmart from 1986 to 1992. She is among the thousands of prominent and successful individuals who have sat on the boards of major corporations. The reason that the rest of us should care about corporate directors is that these are the people who determine the pay of corporate CEOs.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027I\u0027m thankful for so many everyday gifts that are finely woven into the tapestry of my life -- like my loving life partner, good friends, inspiring work, a close, caring family, smart colleagues, good health and lots of laughter.Award-winning actress, author and activistThe ongoing assault on the civil justice system in our country has resulted in a lessened public appreciation of the law of torts, which is one of the major pillars of our legal system and provides crucial protections for individuals. Now comes the American Museum of Tort Law.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorJust like immigration reform, mass incarceration and the need to change our criminal justice system are sparking another movement -- especially after the parable of Ferguson woke up the country.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"LYIN\u0027 BRIAN GOES INTO HIDIN\u0027",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
