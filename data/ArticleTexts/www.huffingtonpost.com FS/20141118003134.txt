{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The voting turnout in this year\u0027s congressional and gubernatorial elections was the lowest since 1942. Much of the story was in young people, poor people, black and Hispanic citizens who tend to support Democrats voting in far lower numbers than in 2008 or 2012. The Democrats just weren\u0027t offering them very much. But the other part of the Election Day story was older voters and the white working class, especially men, deserting the Democrats in droves -- again, because Democrats didn\u0027t seem to be offering much. Republicans, at least, were promising lower taxes. Turnout on average dropped from 2012 by a staggering 42 percent. But as Sam Wang reported in a post-election piece for the American Prospect, the drop-off was evidently worse for Democrats. The two parts of this story seem to create an impossible conundrum for Democrats.In 1965, for every dollar earned by the average worker, CEOs earned 20 dollars. By 2012, that gap mushroomed to 354 to one. But, when asked in the survey, Americans grossly underestimated this gap.Author, \"How to Make a Million Dollars an Hour\" (Wiley 2013)This bill would bypass essential reviews, skip safety assessments, and fast track a dangerous project. This has sweeping implications for future generations. And yet it is entangled in the politics of the moment.President, NRDCWhen there are enough witnesses who say Officer Darren Wilson acted improperly, then why not go to trial, allow both sides to present evidence and make their case, and then let that jury determine Wilson\u0027s guilt or innocence?President, National Action NetworkFor 17 months, you have been very patient with House Republican leaders, encouraging them to either take up and pass the bipartisan Senate bill or work with you to craft a different bill.U.S. Senator from CaliforniaIt\u0027s the same old song and dance -- corporations want more control at the expense of consumer choice and at the expense of a fair market. Net neutrality is about whether or not corporations have the right to seize this control and obtain the ability to give preferential treatment to certain websites, companies or services.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorOffice gossip is alive, flowing freely and -- depending on your point of view -- either as natural as casual conversation or a pathogen infecting morale, productivity and even health. Adding to the darker view, gossip may be a special problem for women -- its most able practitioners and, perhaps, its most vulnerable targets.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarThere may be aspects of the Common Core Standards that are useful to students and teachers. The problem is that student learning is just collateral damage. From the start, Common Core has always been primarily about corporate profits and high-stakes testing.Social studies educator, Hofstra University, my opinions, of course, are my ownAmerica is afflicted with a debilitating ailment that has warped the collective national mind. Its symptoms are the experience of persistent delusions and a distorted sense of objective reality.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghThe two parties are now competing to see which party can stamp its name on the Keystone XL pipeline that threatens our planet first. This is a transparent Hail Mary to save one of the oil industry\u0027s biggest champions, Senator Mary Landrieu.President, Friends of the EarthSo far, the Supreme Court has been much more cautious about same-sex marriage than it was about inter-racial marriage a half-century ago. Its two rulings in June 2013 -- overturning DOMA and California\u0027s Prop 8 -- reflected the basic conservatism of the Roberts Court.E.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeBaathists like those have not only simply \u0027joined\u0027 with Islamist groups like IS to reinforce their insurgency. They actively set them up. The group\u0027s original name ISIS or ISIL, meaning \u0027Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant,\u0027 refers to the Sunni majority area across Iraq and Syria, which they now control.Founder and Director, Organisation for Democracy and Freedom in SyriaWe\u0027ve waited this long, I think we can afford to wait another couple of weeks. It might not change anything -- it might not influence congressional Republicans in the slightest -- but there is a chance that it could. That chance is worth taking.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comHave you ever stood at the bottom of one of those old city buildings that has, at its center, a spiral staircase that goes all the way from the lobby up to the top floor? Well, those buildings look a lot like our lives.Contemporary thought leader and spiritual teacherWhen I saw the news coverage of White House health care adviser Jonathan Gruber\u0027s remarks, in which he essentially called Americans stupid, I thought of the old saying, \"With friends like that, who needs enemies?\" My next thought was, who\u0027s being stupid here?Author, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgNancy Pelosi is a unifier and not a divider within her Caucus. Time after time the Democrats were united -- from promoting the Make it in America jobs agenda to fighting the GOP shutdown.Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersWhatever triggered Obama\u0027s transformation, it\u0027s a heartening moment for his base. The challenge now for him is to deliver on that change; the challenge for his supporters is to rescue the stakes of these changes from soap opera.USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorThe Chicago Humanities Festival sold an estimated 36,000 tickets to its packed lineup of 112 events this year. These were the takeaways from talks featuring the fearless trio of Anjelica Huston, Marjane Satrapi and Patti Smith.Chicago Editor, The Huffington PostA new state law requires the city either to provide free space or pay rent for a charter school to occupy another space. However, we should not allow this encroachment on our already severely crunched public school space.Vice President, New Business Initiatives, Bill Lynch Associates, LLCTo restore legitimacy and trust, we need a second era of democracy based on integrity and accountability, and with stronger, more open institutions, active citizen citizenship and a culture of public discourse and participation.Advisor to government and business leaders; Author, The Digital Economy, 20th Anniversary EditionI am the fortunate parent who lives in awe of her 15-year-old child, whose courage and conviction to live authentically in a largely unfamiliar and often less-than-friendly world is humbling. And as she has grown into herself, so too have those around her.Writer, editor and parentJust like the little black dress is a wardrobe classic, a swipe of red lipstick is all you need to always look chic and glamorous. However, no one shade of red lipstick will suit every woman, which is why I\u0027ve created a how-to guide to finding the right red for your skin tone this holiday season.Makeup artistOn the brink of a new, post-bankruptcy beginning, Detroit is really two cities. One is comprised of wealthy enclaves linked to a compact, rapidly redeveloping downtown. The other is made up of the rest of the 139-square-mile urban expanse, populated by longtime residents who have fought for decades to survive in an environment that has become increasingly uninhabitable.Author, \u0027A Dream Foreclosed\u0027In this turbulent midterm election year, two academics decided to practice what they preached. They left the classroom, confronted the reality of down-and-dirty politics, and tried to replace moneyed interests with the public interest.Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyThe U.S. government has failed to stop the drug trade at home. Washington also has not created a competent, effective, and honest central government in Afghanistan. How effective will Kabul be in limiting opium production when American troops go home?Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteHere\u0027s good news for lovebirds: If you\u0027re in a happy partnership, married or not, you can keep it that way or make it even better by introducing a few new behaviors and small changes into the relationship.Relationship Expert; Author; Professor;TherapistThat fear, the one that\u0027s keeping you from pursuing your passion, the one that keeps you in a bad relationship because you\u0027d rather be with the wrong person than be alone, isn\u0027t really keeping you safe or alive. It\u0027s keeping you from being real. It\u0027s keeping you from your true self.life coach, mom, yoga teacher, writerThe sheer number of people on the planet means exponentially more brainpower; so, as a species, we\u0027re sparking many more ideas. Thanks to the digital revolution, people are busily batting ideas around the Internet, where they carom and entangle like subatomic particles.Author, \"The Human Age: The World Shaped by Us\"There exist two scenarios where no one can hear you scream. The first is of course, in space because there\u0027s no oxygen. And the second is on Earth, but only if you\u0027re a global Muslim leader condemning ISIS and promoting universal religious freedom.Lawyer, Speaker, Best-Selling Author of \"EXTREMIST\"Yes, Ebola is scary, there isn\u0027t a cure, and people are dying. But Africa shouldn\u0027t provoke an instantaneous association with Ebola, because Africa is not a country -- it\u0027s the world\u0027s second largest continent, home to 15 percent of the planet\u0027s population, and a hell of a lot more than disease.Associate Green Editor, Huffington PostSadness is inevitable -- I\u0027m only human, and trying too hard to rise above it only hurts more. But I do accept. I accept that life is finite, and I accept that my time will come soon. I accept that my life had been and still is a gift, and I accept the likely possibility that I won\u0027t see my kids grow older.Blogger, stay-at-home dadGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"WAITING",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
