{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundMany leaders and philosophers say we should end poverty, but through his visionary innovation, tireless hands-on work, and dogged unwillingness to accept it, Dr. Muhammad Yunus has made ending the cycle of poverty a reality for millions of people around the world, especially millions of women and their children. Dr. Yunus truly believes, as I do, that the day will dawn when children will have to visit museums to see how the world once allowed so many fellow human beings to live in poverty in a world God created with plenty if we shared -- and everything he does brings that day closer.Comments (255)Candy ChangArtist, TED Senior FellowContemplating death is a powerful tool to re-appreciate the present and remember what makes your life meaningful to you. We\u0027re all trying to make sense of our lives and there\u0027s great comfort in knowing you\u0027re not alone.Comments (349)Bob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowWho could\u0027ve guessed that force-feeding horror stories about terrorism into minds of the American public and news media in order to establish a massive eavesdropping infrastructure would give rise to the NSA\u0027s intelligence gathering operations just several years later?Comments (695)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarUltimately, what kids watch isn\u0027t up to the MPAA. In truth, the responsibility for monitoring children\u0027s viewing of films lies with parents, who should investigate movies thoroughly before introducing them to any underage child.Comments (89)David Katz, M.D.Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterThere is a certain irony in the nearly immediate juxtaposition of the rare introduction of a new FDA-approved drug for weight loss (Belviq) to the marketplace and the recognition of obesity as a \"disease\" by the AMA. A line from the movie Jerry Maguire comes to mind: \"You complete me!\"Comments (379)Bill GeorgeProfessor of Management Practice, Harvard Business SchoolToday\u0027s pace and stress are so great that people are searching for new practices to find resilience in the midst of chaos, and mindfulness programs are helping them find better ways to live.Comments (125)Lori FradkinSenior Lifestyle EditorMy reasons for divulging information about myself in such a public forum go beyond money, notoriety or even, yes, ego.CommentsDesmond Tutu1984 Nobel Peace Prize winnerIf the corporate thinking that places profits over our own humanity has begun to invade the American university system, causing it to bow to pressure from some of the worst human rights violators in our world today in favor of expansion into the Chinese market, it has gone too far.Comments (62)Jodi Ellen MalpasAuthorBeing a British writer, I\u0027m all about the knickers, but I\u0027m quite partial to some panties, too! I can remember the first email that I received asking me what a jumper was, and then another wanting clarification on what knickers were.Comments (138)James ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Who is Netanyahu fooling, his cabinet and government, or the U.S. president and secretary of state? This is what John Kerry will have to discern as he attempts to move forward.Comments (53)Lea LaneAuthor, Travel Tales I Couldn\u0027t Put in the GuidebooksLook, some may be piling on, as they probably resent that this friendly woman of dubious intellect and over-the-top cooking skills has conned her way into fame and fortune. But those who defend her racial slurs because \"everyone does it\" are dead wrong.Comments (49)Dr. Jill BidenSecond Lady of the United StatesSmall businesses play a critical role in helping our economy, but to stay competitive they need access to a motivated, flexible and skilled workforce.Comments (104)Susan SarandonActress, activist and motherIn 2012 I supported Amendment 64 in Colorado, a common sense step toward ending the archaic prohibition mindset that has resulted in the U.S. leading the world in the incarceration of our people -- a prison system packed with non-violent drug offenders.Comments (355)Terry Gaspard, MSW, LICSWLicensed Clinical Social Worker and College InstructorWhy is the pursuer- distancer pattern so common and destructive to relationships? It makes sense that the power struggle for emotional intimacy often plays itself out in the bedroom.Comments (96)Mike RyanSenior Entertainment Writer, The Huffington PostWorld War Z, a movie about zombies, will soon be in movie theaters. Brad Pitt (The Devil\u0027s Own) stars as man who does not want to be eaten by zombies. He also does not want his family to be eaten by zombies. It\u0027s safe to say that Brad Pitt\u0027s character frowns upon zombies who eat people.Comments (64)James Beard FoundationPreserving America\u0027s diverse culinary heritage and futureA new cuisine based on old flavors, local ingredients, nostalgic resonances, and the culinary culture clash.CommentsRobin HoffmanWriter, Small Business OwnerAfter seeing a Facebook photo of Carmina and her best friend Patty last month, I realized something was wrong. The comments below the picture read \u0027BFF\u0027s before there were BFF\u0027s\u0027 and \u0027Very significant photo.\u0027 I sent questions to her FB friends. The funeral was the next morning.CommentsJohn FarrEditor, bestmoviesbyfarr.comAt a time when a movie like Django Unchained can earn a Best Screenplay Oscar, I\u0027m grateful for the Coen Brothers. At a time when a director insists on putting hip-hop music into a Roaring Twenties period picture, I\u0027m grateful for the Coen Brothers. Just why am I grateful? Well, let me count the ways.Comments (29)Lauren WarnerBlogger and Editor, 3 Things For MomI cannot tell you what challenges your precious one might have -- just as I cannot tell you what challenges anybody\u0027s child will have, \"special needs\" or not. One aspect of your child\u0027s life just happens to be detectable by prenatal medical technology.Comments (228)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorFed policy always has costs and benefits and deep monetary stimulus is no free lunch. But as long as the broader economy remains in the residual gravitational pull of the great recession, the benefits of the Fed\u0027s aggressive actions outweigh the costs.Comments (280)The StirCafeMom blogThere are SOME \"healthy\" foods that absolutely do NOT make me feel like my very best self. At all. In fact, given the choice between these superfoods and a super-sized rear end, I think I\u0027d choose the extra booty every time.Comments (31)Catie ParrishChief Homemaker, Wayfair.comYes, yes, our guests\u0027 comfort and happiness are the top priority. But we also want to wow them. We want to create a setting that\u0027s clever, pretty, and -- dare I say -- pin-worthy. The good news is there are ways to show your creativity without having to take three days off work.CommentsLisa ZeidnerAuthorLast week my husband and I celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary. At least we think we did. It\u0027s kind of hard to count.CommentsAnastasia KhooMarketing Director, Human Rights CampaignIn March, Facebook went red for marriage equality as millions of people around the world changed their profile pictures in unity to the Human Rights Campaign\u0027s logo. No one at HRC, myself included, imagined the response would become as big as it did.CommentsArianna HuffingtonIn this week\u0027s issue, Tom Zeller looks at the American fishing industry and three different factors affecting it, and Mallika Rao puts the spotlight on the rise of Braco, a Croatian healer whose method is simple and, some say, miraculously effective.Comments (14)Maureen RyanTV critic, The Huffington PostHannibal is a monster, of course, but Mads Mikkelsen\u0027s performance and the show\u0027s great writing for the character limned a portrait of a very human monster, one whose terrible actions begin in a somewhat understandable place.Comments (35)Rev. Jim BallAuthor, \u0027Global Warming and the Risen LORD: Christian Discipleship and Climate Change\u0027The Washington Post\u0027s Juliet Eilperin reports something I never would have thought in a million years. Google is supporting one of the worst climate-denier organizations in the worldComments (341)Jim Yong KimPresident, World Bank GroupOver the last 20 years, the World Bank Group has helped countries lift 663 million people out of poverty. In the next 20, we believe it is possible to end extreme poverty. This goal is within our grasp. But if we don\u0027t confront climate change, we won\u0027t end poverty.Comments (48)Shelley EmlingEditor, Post 50People always say that my daughter looks just like my husband and nothing like me, a remark that\u0027s a bit disheartening considering that, in their next breath, they usually note how pretty she is.Comments (60)Franco NuscheseBoard member, Global Virus NetworkOne only needs to think for a moment about SARS and HIV-AIDS and try not to shudder. It\u0027s not just about health, it\u0027s also about how it affects economies and national security. Governments cannot carry the burden of viruses and disease by themselves.CommentsJim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027Skepticism is a good and healthy thing. But cynicism is a spiritually dangerous thing because it is a buffer against personal commitment. Personal commitment is all that has ever changed the world, transformed human lives, and altered history.Comments (94)Shawn Amos, 2013.22.06Peter Gardett, 2013.22.06Michael Shank, 2013.22.06Lea Lane, 2013.22.06Mary Novaria, 2013.22.06Barbara Greenberg, 2013.22.06George Heymont, 2013.22.06Nayri Leanna Gregor, 2013.22.06Anastasia Khoo, 2013.22.06Kathi Sharpe-Ross, 2013.22.06Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"U.S. WARNS HONG KONG: EXTRADITE OR ELSE",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
