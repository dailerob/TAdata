{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Assoc. Professor, Univ. of Missouri, Kansas City; Sr. regulator during S\u0026L debacleThe new mantra of the Republican Party is the old mantra -- regulation is a \"job killer.\" It is certainly possible to have regulations kill jobs, and when I was a financial regulator I was a leader in cutting away many dumb requirements. But we have just experienced the epic ability of the anti-regulators to kill well over ten million jobs. The anti-regulators subverted the rule of law and allowed elite frauds to loot with impunity. Why isn\u0027t the new House leadership investigating that disgrace as one of their top priorities?Read Post | CommentsJason Linkins and Ben Craw, 01.13.2011If you were a member of the 24-hour cable teevee media, all that can be said about the Way We Mourn Now is that it was such an awful inconvenience!Read Post | CommentsDennis A. Henigan, 01.14.2011Brady Center Vice President and Author of \"Lethal Logic\"Those who own guns and those who do not, to a surprising degree, have the same vision for America.

Paul Tonko, 01.14.2011Attempts to blindly defund a public broadcasting budget amounts to little more than a reactionary attempt to inject federal censorship and leftover partisan outrage into one of the last bastions of a truly free press in America.Read Post | CommentsMarshall Fine, 01.14.2011Author and film critic, hollywoodandfine.comEvery Day swims in mock profundity and has the feel of a movie made specifically for a forgiving festival audience.
