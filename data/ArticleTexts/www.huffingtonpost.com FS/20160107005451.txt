{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, People For the American WayThe ad proclaims that banning Muslims from entering our country is the right way to keep Americans safe, and in video that turns out to be footage from Morocco, not Mexico, we\u0027re warned that closing off the border with a wall is the only immigration reform we need. This should be a \"have you no decency?\" moment, but sadly, we shouldn\u0027t be surprised that no candidate has stood up to Trump\u0027s ad in any meaningful way. They\u0027re not speaking out because they are in lock step, following Trump\u0027s lead. Marco Rubio has proposed shutting down mosques in the United States. Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz believe we should only allow Christian -- not Muslim -- refugees from Syria. Ben Carson likened refugees to \"rabid dogs.\" Silly us to expect that any candidate will call anything that Trump says or does \"a bridge too far,\" when it is a bridge they have already crossed themselves.Many, many people suffering from mental illness, including those who have experienced psychosis and hallucinations or who have lived through suicidal moments or even attempts, go on to live successful, productive lives. All we need to do is let them. Because it\u0027s not helping the mentally ill that we should fear. It\u0027s what happens if we don\u0027t.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarAll-in-all, we have a pretty decent system with regards to legal jurisprudence, but there are purists left and right who would dismantle it. Because it is imperfect and jury-rigged, it is vulnerable to their jibes.These days it is the right that seems to hold the cards (or votes) on the Supreme Court.Constitutional law professor, Harvard Law School; Solicitor General of the U.S., 1985-89As a proud, responsible gun owner, I paid close attention to the president\u0027s speech outlining his executive actions on guns and studied the written proposal put forth by the White House carefully. I can\u0027t not support them.Emmy Award-winning television personality, decorated former Naval officer, inspirational speaker, author, entrepreneurNorth Korea announced that it conducted a hydrogen bomb test, hailing it \"a complete success.\" If confirmed, the test, which ignited a firestorm of reaction from nations worldwide, would violate UN Security Council agreements and mark a significant advancement for the country\u0027s nuclear capabilities.Vocativ - news sourced from the deep web.Talk about sore losers. The Canadian pipeline company TransCanada announced this afternoon that it is suing Obama Administration over its decision to reject the Keystone XL pipeline. The lawsuit won\u0027t do anything to help get the pipeline built, it\u0027s too late for that.Co-founder and Communications Director, 350.orgToday, Republicans in Congress plan to make history. Not for growing the economy or helping the middle class -- but for sending a bill to President Obama that will defund women\u0027s health care and hurt millions of Americans.U.S. Representative, Maryland\u0027s eighth congressional districtAuntie Rosa wanted to ensure the constitutional rights of all Americans. These men want public land turned over for private uses. Auntie Rosa was willing to go to jail for her beliefs. These men hide behind guns.Contributor, \u0027Our Auntie Rosa\u0027Award-winning reporter and freelance journalistThe current gun debate is an incredibly revealing moment about us as individuals and as a country.Political strategistHeroin is the dark, dirty secret of America today. Few people recognize the devastation wrought by this drug. So what has led to this resurgence of a drug that had since the 1980s largely been replaced by cocaine, methamphetamines and benzodiazepines?.Psychiatrist, interfaith harmony proponent.Japan must do more to counter false histories. This issue will never be closed if school textbooks and official memorials continue to misrepresent the truth.President \u0026 CEO, Wilson Center; Former U.S. CongresswomanIf we\u0027re going to have laws, then they should be practical laws that actually work. B-b-b-but what about the \"slippery slope\"?? Ah, yes, the slippery slope. Yes, I confess, preventing felons from buying guns sends us hurtling -- no, careening -- down that slippery slope, toward... personal safety.U.S. Congressman for Florida\u0027s 9th DistrictIf nuclear war happened today, it wouldn\u0027t be two blocks of states challenging each other in a deadly arms race, but also the \"new kids on the nuclear block,\" such as India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea.Executive Director, International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear WeaponsAs we celebrate the New Year, let\u0027s commit to real change. Bernie Sanders has challenged us to join him in a political revolution that goes far beyond the presidency. If not now, when?past president, Communications Workers of America,2015 brought many challenges for the Arab American and American Muslim communities. The presidential primary season kicked into gear, and along with it came a fresh wave of bigotry. But looking at the year ahead of us, I am reminded of Arab Americans who, at times when our national character has been challenged, have stepped up and engaged.Government Relations Manager, Arab American InstituteIt\u0027s possible to usher in a new era of sensitive and inclusive dialogue that is not hyper-sensitive. It\u0027s possible to improve the campus sensitivity to microaggressions without making them punishable offenses. Students are so sensitive, and this is one of their best qualities.President and CEO, The NCHERM Group, LLCThe only reason why white ranchers have any land to run their cattle on today -- whether it is land that they hold a deed to, that they now defend against federal seizure, or public land that they currently use to feed their livestock -- was stolen from the American Indians.Historian writing on the history, politics, and current impact of incarceration in AmericaMinority students often exempt themselves from consideration before they even get the chance to succeed by applying to fewer and less-selective colleges than they are academically qualified to attend.Associate Professor and Ben Fryrear Faculty Fellow at the University of Pittsburgh’s Katz Graduate School of BusinessProfessor in the Marketing Department of the McCombs School of Business at the University of TexasAs higher education institutions respond to the recent demands of their students, it is striking that not a single institution of which I am aware is calling for a paradigm shift for racial justice -- a reimagining of the university.Senior Vice President and Dean of Campus Life at Emory UniversityThere\u0027s growing evidence that Mexico is violating the rights of migrants and preventing children from seeking asylum and other forms of protection. Mexico is increasingly detaining and deporting children, in violation of its domestic law and obligations under international human rights law. The U.S. is actively supporting these policies.Youth Justice Attorney, Immigrant Rights Program, American Friends Service Committee, Newark, New JerseyRobert L. Carter Fellow, The Opportunity AgendaEvery day I wish and pray this chapter of our life will pass, but I cannot control when the page turns. I can at least put the secrecy behind me. I believe our power cannot be usurped by things outside of our control. However, shame can immobilizes us when we hold it close.Mother, Manager, Yoga Enthusiast, Writer.The idea that all Muslims should be blocked from entering the U.S. plays well with people who think adherents to Islam are relatively recent arrivals on the American scene. Yet Muslims have been in this country from its inception. Far from being a foreign element, Muslims have been here throughout American history and indeed longer than some Christian religions.historian, author, and college professorDear Donald, Ted, Marco, Jeb, and the whole GOP field, Are you serious? Are you seriously contending that background checks for everyone who buys a gun are bad policy and a threat to the Constitution?Science and Religion Correspondent for the Humanist MagazineThe story of Isaac and Ishmael is difficult to read. The account follows two half-brothers born to the same father and different mothers. As the story played out, one was adored and one was banished. One was considered the heir of their common father; one was disinherited.Associate Professor of Theology at Earlham School of ReligionFounder and president, Rainbow/PUSH CoalitionAssuming the next president gets to replace all four of the oldest justices (Ginsburg, Scalia, Kennedy, and Breyer), we\u0027re in for a big shift. A Democrat could transform the Court\u0027s somewhat reliable 5-4 conservative majority into a solid 6-3 liberal majority.Appellate lawyer in Dallas, TX, handling both civil and criminal appeals.Islamic history is rich with both violent fracturing and civilized disagreement. However Muslims must not allow political or religious leaders to dictate how we treat one another in everyday practical situations after we have such a rich history of mistakes to learn from.Harvard chaplain, Educator and AuthorSo who are Marc Short and Andy Koenig? The Times identified them only as \"the president and senior policy adviser, respectively, at Freedom Partners, which advocates for free-market policies.\"Senior Writer, Union of Concerned ScientistsFor most women, whose lives have not been perfect, Sec. Clinton\u0027s career path -- which has been marked by persistence and resilience in the face of extraordinary barriers -- is cause for celebration and inspiration.President, National Organization for WomenIran is no paragon of democracy. And when its leaders denounce the \"criminal workings\" of the \"vile\" Saudi regime and its links to terrorism, the pot is calling the kettle black. Yet what occurred this past weekend in Saudi Arabia is worrisome for several reasons. Executing 47 people in a single day is a strange way to begin the year.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.I could discuss the many wrongs of this bill from the perspective of someone who is an American born citizen. Yet, I have realized that our nationality of birth is not as relevant as we may have perceived it to be, because the prejudice that pervades our humanity speaks volumes.Iranian-American, founder of Millennial Nomaad, blogger, writer, and advocate for self-empowerment and creative expressionWhen various Republican presidential candidates present their views on addressing poverty at a January 9 forum in South Carolina, some may seek to align themselves with House Speaker Paul Ryan\u0027s proposal to combine funding for numerous safety net programs into what would essentially be a mega-block grant to states. However, Paul Ryan\u0027s \"Opportunity Grant\" proposal carries substantial risk of increasing poverty, rather than reducing it.President, Center on Budget \u0026 Policy PrioritiesGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
