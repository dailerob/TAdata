{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Merry Christmas, HuffPosters! We have a special gift for you tucked under our Featured Blog Posts tree: a line-up of holiday-inspired offerings. As for me, I\u0027m spending this grace-filled day with my daughters, my sister, and my ex-husband (see our Divorce section for advice on co-parenting during the holidays!). And I am spending much more time today on our Impact section, celebrating those committed to making things better, than on our Politics section, fuming over those whose endless partisan bickering is making things worse. Among the blessings I\u0027m most grateful for today is our HuffPost community -- our team, our bloggers, our commenters, and all of our readers -- which has been an incredible gift. Not a return or re-gift in the bunch!Read Post | Comments (168)Marlo Thomas, 12/23/11Award-winning actress; Author; ActivistHere\u0027s what my merry Christmas contingent had to say about their favorite memories.

The real Christmas offers the joyful promise of peace.Read Post | Comments (706)Rep. Louise Slaughter, 12/22/11U.S. Congresswoman from New York\u0027s 28th DistrictBefore you sit down to your holiday ham this season, think on this -- nearly half of pigs on U.S. farms carry MRSA, a \"super bug\" that causes all kinds of tough-to-treat infections.Read Post | Comments (60)Reverend Nicholas Stuart Richards, 12/25/11Assistant Minister, The Abyssinian Baptist Church in New York and Co-founder \u0026 President of The Abyssinian FundThe Christmas story sounds imaginary. Mary became pregnant by the Holy Spirit. Unbelievable. If it wasn\u0027t for Jesus. With Jesus the unbelievable becomes believable. The impossible becomes possible. God does what no one else can do.Read Post | Comments (13)Will Durst, 12/23/11Political comic, former radio talk show host, syndicated columnist, author, motivational speakerThose of us who have been washed prone by the gushing holiday faucet of red and green greed and are dreading the repurposed solstice celebration as it drips down the gutter of melancholy revealing the regurgitated fruitcake of gloom and despair could use a nice wish list.Read Post | CommentsMeredith Fineman, 12/22/11Blogger, TheFFJD.comI received what can only be described as a disturbing message today -- an acquaintance of mine sent me two articles on why Jews shouldn\u0027t celebrate Christmas.Read Post | Comments (398)Rev. Jesse Jackson, 12/20/11Civil rights activistThis Christmas, let everyone take a moment for the real story. Let us take stock of how we treat the young in the dawn of life, the poor in the pit of life, the elderly in the dusk of life.Read Post | Comments (85)Devon Corneal, 12/23/11Lawyer, MotherI\u0027ve been so focused on teaching my kids lessons, I\u0027ve failed to learn them myself.

It\u0027s his satire -- and especially his way of using words -- puns, neologisms, wordplay, etc. to encourage his audience to think critically.Read Post | CommentsDavid Wild, 12/15/11TV Writer; Contributing Editor, Rolling Stone; Co-Author, \u0027Diary of a Player\"\u0027Here\u0027s a list of ten Christmas songs that never get old for me even during this holiday season when it can be difficult to hear anything but seasonal classics.Read Post | Comments (242)Donna Britt, 12/22/11Award-winning columnistOther women\u0027s paths to giving may be as hidden as mine.
