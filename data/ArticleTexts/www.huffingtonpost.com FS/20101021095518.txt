There are plenty of people all across the country responding to the failures and fiascos filling the news with creativity, generosity, passion, and selflessness. But you don\u0027t see much about that response in the media. To help remedy that, we\u0027re launching a new feature called HuffPost\u0027s Greatest Person of the Day, which will put the spotlight on the tens of thousands of people who are refusing to let their lives -- and the lives of their families and communities -- be blighted by the consequences of inept leadership without doing something about it. We want this feature to be fueled by you. So let us know: Who are the people in your community who have stepped up, refused to give in, and are making their corner of the country a little bit better?Read Post | CommentsBob Cesca, 10.20.2010Host of the Bob and Elvis ShowThe Republican strategy for this midterm election is simple: Treat voters like easily manipulated hoopleheads.
