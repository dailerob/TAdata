{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The mounting catastrophe of Syrian refugees in Europe is one part the same old same old, \"not in my backyard,\" but with several new wrinkles. One is the complete paralysis of the European Union as a government able to take emergency action. The humanitarian crisis is happening right now in real time, but the EU operates by consensus if not unanimity and it operates with agonizing slowness. Several nations don\u0027t want anything to do with refugees. Hungary\u0027s brutal response is more candid and ugly than others, but in this story there are few heroes. One hero is the Prime Minister of Sweden, Stefan Löfven. Sweden has been more generous to refugees and immigrants than most nations, and now faces a backlash.Labor Day is a time for honoring the working people of this country. It is a time to celebrate the accomplishments of the activists and organizers who fought for the 40-hour work week, occupational safety protection and other workplace rights. These working people resisted the oligarchs of their day, fought for a more responsive democracy, and built the middle class.U.S. Senator from VermontEvery year I speak to the families of new students at Wesleyan University just before they say goodbye and we start our semester. Having just dropped off my daughter (far from home) as she starts her first year in college, this was particularly poignant for me.President, Wesleyan UniversityJob or not, this Labor Day, I stand with working women -- with Tracy and Raven and Adriana -- who are fighting for the most basic right of all: the right to have a life and make a living.Columnist, Waging Nonviolence; author of \"It Runs in the Family: On Being Raised by Radicals and Growing into Rebellious Motherhood\"This widely reported \"official\" number overlooks the millions of people unemployed for more than a year, nor does it count those who are working part-time and looking for full-time work. The Department of Labor monthly report which includes people working part-time and looking for full-time work shows the real rate of unemployment.Law Professor, Loyola University New Orleans, CCR Associate Legal DirectorThe sobering truth of the matter is that Canada\u0027s refugee policy is not generous at all, neither compared to other countries today, nor compared to that most famous refugee destination historically, the Canada of the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s.Writer, activist, J.D. candidate at Yale Law School.The closet seems like a vestige from a darker time. Many young LGBT people never experienced the repression, but there is an older generation of men who closed the door decades ago and now find themselves tentatively stepping out into a terrifying world. They often feel alone.Writer and Blogger, \u0027The Authentic Life\u0027Last week, President Obama made the most extensive presidential visit to Alaska ever. He hiked on a glacier, met with Native Alaskans, and became the first president ever to visit the Arctic Circle. Throughout, he was calling attention to the real, on-the-ground effects of climate change.Executive Director, The Sierra ClubThe Republican presidential primary spectacle is the beginning of electoral anarchy. The same disruptive conditions and forces that are bedeviling Republicans this primary season are likely to discombobulate future Democratic presidential primaries and to morph inevitably into general election anarchy.Founder, Democracy AllianceSo here you go: The top five things that occurred when I stopped complaining, both the good and the bad.Author. Blogger. Adventurer. And everything in-between.For Gov. Huckabee to invoke the example of murdered, black Martin Luther King Jr. to rally against a movement that identifies itself as Black Lives Matter is at its simplest thoughtlessness to the point of dangerousness. Do good intentions trump negative impact? Not when the impact is on you.Dismantling racism from the inside outOne could hardly blame liberal Jews for wanting to celebrate AIPAC\u0027s defeat or for some Israeli\u0027s to lament what they called \"Netanyahu\u0027s strategic blunder\". Both views, however, are naïve and shortsighted. On several levels, Netanyahu won.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Now it seems that the GOP right is faced with having to come up with a new formula. There is really little chance that enough of the country (or let alone even Republican voters) will remain entertained, amused, gratified by Trump, or Carson for that matter.Louise Hewlett Nixon Professor, Stanford UniversityWomen are unlikely to ask priests to forgive us for having an abortion. But we should welcome a conversation with Pope Francis about providing relief from the damage Catholics and others suffer as a result the Church\u0027s obstinately backwards position of recent decades.Co-Director, Center for Policy AnalysisHowever, one of the best ways to keep the side effects of aging at bay may be something anyone can do, for free: get better sleep. The more we learn about rest and biology, the clearer it is that sleep plays an important role in keeping skin, bodies and minds young. In fact, it may be one of the most effective things you can do.Entrepreneur, CEO at One Mall GroupThe essence of this special day is about acknowledging the strength, skill, persistence and even artistry demonstrated every time any job is done well. It\u0027s something we too readily forget in a world that seems to be more and more dominated by fame, fortune and reality television.REDF President and CEOClearly not all experts or genetics researchers are inclined to take the low road by participating in such ethically unacceptable activities.Professor of Cell Biology and Anatomy, New York Medical CollegeIt\u0027s not a party without chips and dip. From Chile Con Queso to Roasted Garlic Guacamole, these flavorful recipes are all serious crowd-pleasers.Chef, Recipe Developer and Busy MomGiven the high rate of sexual assault by athletes, colleges have an enhanced duty to ensure that athletes are not given special privileges exempting them from federal legal mandates. It is high time that athletic departments and colleges enforced Title IX, fully.Legal Momentum is a nonprofit legal advocacy organization dedicated to advancing and defending the rights of women and girls since 1970.I don\u0027t get angry about immigration, legal or otherwise, or about women in power, or about people with Asian or Spanish accents trying to make lives for themselves or their families in the United States.This is, old angry people, the future of America. You can rage against it and try to build fences and you may win in the very short run. But in the long run, you will lose.Journalist/ProducerHere\u0027s a tip for all you professional scoffers sneering at Trump\u0027s chances of winning the nomination, and should he pull that off, disparage as laughable the thought of a victory in the general. Just remember... they said the same thing about Ronald Reagan.Political comic, former radio talk show host, syndicated columnist, author, motivational speakerPolitical leaders preaching intolerance express the collective\u0027s shadow by projecting their own grandiosity, moral superiority, paranoia, and retaliatory policies toward those deemed other or not normal.Alan Briskin is an award-winning author, artist, and leadership consultant. His most recent book, the co-authored The Power of Collective Wisdom: And the Trap of Collective Folly, was the winner of the Nautilus Book Award in the category of Conscious Business and Leadership.Israel\u0027s multiple fault lines -- secular vs. religious, Jewish vs. Palestine and controversial calls for a boycott of the Jewish state -- are exploding on the soccer pitch.Senior fellow, S. Rajaratnam School of International StudiesThanks to an article on BBC.com, we now know that the vast majority of moviegoers would prefer not to see people post-60 having sex onscreen. This fact dovetails with the vast majority of people post-60 who would prefer not to watch themselves having sex.AuthorAs we begin another semester, notice the adult students who are working toward their dreams. These people are heroes - the few, the goal oriented, the self-advocating, the always-present, the well-supported, the positive thinking, the surviving, the grateful: the ultimate graduates.Academic Dean and Associate Professor, Champlain CollegeJust after President Obama took office, a Department of Homeland Security report recognized that the combination of a tanking economy together with the election of America\u0027s first African-American president might trigger right-wing violence. The report was later withdrawn, given the headwinds of conservative criticism.bookkeeper, political observer, chess enthusiastI\u0027d say it\u0027s a pretty safe bet you didn\u0027t expect to be divorced, single and dating at this time in your life. Right? And because a divorce judge didn\u0027t hand you a dating rule book as you left the courtroom, you might be feeling pretty frustrated and overwhelmed with the over-50\u0027s dating scene.Dating Coach For Women Over 50There are many days I just need to get to tomorrow -- all I can do is put one foot in front of the other. If you\u0027re feeling this way, ever, you\u0027re not alone. Here are some quick actions you can take to help you get through the day -- or even just the minute.Feminist, body positive, wife, mom of five, Editor In Chief at ravishly.com, (sometimes) RN.As summer gives way to fall, let the played out songs in your gym mix give way to some current alternatives. This month\u0027s top picks have plenty going for them -- with a variety of genres and tempos represented. Moreover, with just a few new tracks here and there, you can re-energize your whole routine.DJ, RunHundred.comWhen you think of a homeless person, a certain stereotype comes to mind. A middle-aged to older man who\u0027s addicted to drugs and too lazy to get a job living on the streets. I\u0027m not going to pretend that I never thought that, but everything changed when I became homeless.Online Marketplace for College LifeI was married at 20 and divorced by 26. It was the eighties, the decade of Princess Diana and Madonna, and it seemed everyone was doing it -- getting married young and divorcing.Writer, teller of stories, giver of hugs, singer of show tunes, lover of laughs, dogs, chocolate, travel and motorcycles.Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
