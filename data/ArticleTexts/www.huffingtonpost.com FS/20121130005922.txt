{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Former Prime Minister of GreeceMy recent experience in dealing with the financial crisis in Greece and in Europe has confirmed my belief that this is a political crisis more than a financial one. Whether it is banks or governments, we have adopted a passive, almost defeatist, attitude, which we cloak in the language of \"caution and responsibility.\" It is our responsibility to break this cycle of fear and mistrust now. We do have a choice.

As a citizen of Europe, I vote for the first choice.Read Post | Comments (51)Bob Cesca, 11/29/12Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez Show, Media ProducerJonah Goldberg doesn\u0027t believe there are any racists in the Republican Party.

President Obama still has the opportunity to be a transformational president, but only if he spends his second term finally unleashing the audacity that propelled his presidency in the beginning -- on issues from gun control and the failed drug war to privacy and drones.Read Post | Comments (495)Desmond Tutu, 11/29/121984 Nobel Peace Prize winnerHistory shows when we take action before the peak of disaster, enormous gains can be realized.
