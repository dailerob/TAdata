{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week we said goodbye to 2015, a year that definitely could have been improved upon. And since resolutions are easier to make for others than for ourselves, here are a few we\u0027d like to see for 2016: President Obama: To borrow from another political leader (the Emperor Palpatine) to give into your anger and use it to do something about gun control. Ben Carson: To go back to brain surgery. Jeb Bush: To stop trying to kick the football every time Donald Trump holds it out for you. And, after finally dropping out of the race, to devote yourself to remaking the Republican Party. Americans: To not give into fear by giving up your core values and principles. For all of us: To get more sleep, so we can be healthier, more creative, more productive and make better decisions in 2016 than we did in 2015.Fighting climate change is a moral imperative. And yet, just as protecting our children from the widening dangers of climate chaos is a challenge, it\u0027s also an opportunity. It\u0027s the economic play of our lifetime.Actor, director and environmental activistA new year faces us. Who the hell are we and what have we become if we accept this kind of tragedy as unavoidable? What are our resolves?Actress and authorThe start of this New Year finds America at an inflection point as wars and terrorism abroad are echoed in violence, suspicion, and fear at home. How will we meet the moment?President, Children\u0027s Defense FundTo the average person looking at the simple facts of the case, there was enough evidence in each of these cases to proceed with a trial. And yet, here we are, shaking our heads, wondering how the pursuit of justice was thwarted yet again.Former Executive Editor Of Global Spirituality and Religion, The Huffington PostIn 2016, politicians and pundits will certainly continue to pontificate about the pitfalls of political correctness. There just isn\u0027t any downside to attacking this imaginary monster of groupthink, so we can expect to hear speakers trumpeting their own courage in \"not being pc\" as they attack especially vulnerable groups in society.President, Wesleyan UniversityIf we in Europe call humanity one of our fundamental values, ??then we cannot leave the people who are turning to us for help to freeze in the field.Activist, Pussy Riot band memberThese genius inventions are sending us careening into a world of abundance, bold visionaries and accelerating exponential change.Chairman/CEO, XPRIZEA Cosby prosecution rightly tosses the ugly glare back on the wrong public perceptions about rape and sexual abuse and how easily the crime can still be blown off. But it also casts light on two other deeply troubling questions.Author and political analystThis year, contributors to The Huffington Post published thousands of blogs, offering their perspectives on topics ranging from LGBT rights to gun violence to body image. In no particular order, here are some of our most talked-about blogs from 2015.Deputy blog editor, The Huffington PostThe Saudis, Qataris, and others in the region (like much of the world) are unlikely to change course and take responsibility for their security, because they believe that Uncle Sam will keep doing it for them.Vice President for Defense and Foreign Policy Studies, Cato Institute.Natalie Cole appeared many times as a guest on my PBS television program. One particular appearance, however, was exceedingly delicate and heartrending. She had just received a life-saving kidney transplant, but felt guilty to still be alive. What she had to share that day was, well, unforgettable.PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorAt a time when America is experiencing an upsurge of progressive organizing and activism -- from Occupy Wall Street to Black Lives Matter to Bernie Sanders\u0027 campaign for president -- we need a regular columnist who can explain what\u0027s going on, why it\u0027s happening, and what it means.E.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeWell we did it. Made it through another year. When it comes to women, we\u0027ve had some good news, and some bad news, with a little weird news thrown in.Money Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsIt is often said that a man\u0027s character is his fate. But the presidency magnifies character far beyond the man himself. For four years, George Bush\u0027s character was America\u0027s fate. This good man was our good fortune.Novelist and contributing opinion writerIf you vote for anyone other than Bernie Sanders in 2016, you\u0027re simply not a progressive. You\u0027re also voting for endless wars with Trump or Clinton, while Bernie Sanders says \"I\u0027ll be dammed\" to more quagmires.Columnist published in The Cleveland Plain Dealer, The Baltimore Sun, The Hill, Salon, The Jerusalem Post www.hagoodman.comApparently, The Force Awakens can only be regarded as a great or appalling film, and nothing else. Here are 10 reasons why irate critiques of The Force Awakens miss their mark.Assistant Professor of English at University of New Hampshire; Series Co-Editor, Best American Experimental WritingMuch has been written about the anger of white men, and in some ways, their anger is given support and the systems in place which have caused and supported white supremacy lend a sympathetic ear, for the most part. But what about the anger of black people?Writer, author, musician, pastor, preacher and social justice advocate.Every vote for a candidate from the right in the current political climate is a vote for more of the same -- extreme wealth and power concentrated in the hands of a very small segment of the population.Professor of Religious Studies and Human Dimensions of Organizations, University of Texas, AustinI guess nurses are a secretive bunch. But if it\u0027s right what they say, that the truth will set you free, then here are 10 secrets your nurse has been keeping from you.Brie is a part-time nurse and full-time mom. When she\u0027s not chasing children, doting on her husband, or trying to catch up on laundry she enjoys writing.If only the people who engage in \"road rage\" would engage in \"corporate rage\" when they are harmed by cover-ups or hazardous products and gouging services, aloof CEOs would start getting serious about safety and fair play.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorTamir Rice\u0027s death wasn\u0027t a \"tragedy.\" Nor was Michael Brown\u0027s, Eric Garner\u0027s, Trayvon Martin\u0027s, and the countless others\u0027. Their deaths are all perfectly explicable as the product of a racialized criminal justice system prone to use excessive force. That means their deaths were also all unnecessary and avoidable.Professor, writerDoes there really exist an industry of deeply funded anti-tax lobbyists whose sole purpose is to protect the holdings of their clients? Absolutely -- far from \"mistaken,\" that narrative is exactly right. Do they win every fight? Nope, and they lost the one that led the capital gains rate to go up in 2013.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorI cannot keep up with all the things that I am not supposed to say to other mothers and all the things that I am supposed to be offended by.

Like some organ has been removed and you can\u0027t really breathe properly. It\u0027s waking up each morning where your first thought is this is another day without your person. And in that way, without the you that you were. It\u0027s going to bed alone each night without him.Writer, Yogi and Failed Online DaterSometimes, figuratively speaking, all the money in the world can\u0027t change a political outcome. This very idea runs counter to all the dire warnings about money\u0027s corruptive influence on American politics, of course, but it makes it no less true -- at least in certain situations.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comHONG KONG -- The Paris agreement was a step forward. Now, coordinated and sensible action is required. To do that, we need to challenge the myths around how to deal with climate change.Founder and CEO of the Global Institute For TomorrowFor many, myself included, this season can often bring grim and painful reminders of the loss of a loved one, pet, relationship or job.

We\u0027re usually much more updated on the happenings of celebrities.Author of Blue and Method Meets Art Second EditionMost people don\u0027t spend their days enmeshed in policy issues; they have jobs and lives.
