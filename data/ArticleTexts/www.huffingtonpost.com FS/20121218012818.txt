{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The society now can go in one of two directions. Either we will just accept periodic shooting sprees as one of those unfortunate things that must be lived with -- like, say, the periodic flooding and death that results from global climate change? If we go that route, even our sweetest, safest elementary schools will be turned into fortresses. The remnants of our open society will be turned into a surveillance society. We will solve our unemployment problem by hiring millions more armed guards. Alternatively, we can finally get serious about gun control. But the leadership has to come from the president. Barack Obama has a gift for moving public sentiment. If ever there were a moment to use it, on behalf on murdered first graders and others who might be spared, that moment is now.Read Post | Comments (109)Gary Hart, 12/16/12President, Hart International, Ltd.It is not realistic to expect a gun-less America. But, whatever else the Second Amendment may or may not mean, it is posited on a \"well-regulated militia,\" a militia mentioned three times in the Constitution.Read Post | Comments (1,547)Dan Whisler, 12.17.2012Environmental science teacherWhen I started teaching, I never would have thought that an automobile could become my classroom of the future. While at times it is hectic securing funding for our project and developing the resources and curriculum to go with it, I am happy to provide our students real-world opportunities not possible through any textbook.Read Post | CommentsMitchell Bard, 12/17/12Writer and FilmmakerArguments against reasonable, limited gun control are not based on empirical positions but on subjective gut-feelings. The reasons offered to oppose gun control are emotional responses meant to divert the argument from the evidence.Read Post | Comments (814)Lisa Belkin, 12/17/12Senior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, The Huffington PostParents can\u0027t hide anymore either. There is nothing left to conjure from our desperate imaginations that separates our children from the ones who were dropped off for just another day of school Friday morning. There is no way to blame their parents here. So we have to blame ourselves.Read Post | CommentsHarold S. Koplewicz, MD, 12/17/12President, Child Mind InstituteTo blame the violence in Newtown, Connecticut on Asperger\u0027s or a personality disorder, as many media outlets currently are, is a serious mistake.Read Post | Comments (23)Sarah Brady, 12/16/12Chair, The Brady Center to Prevent Gun ViolenceThe Brady Law, named for my husband after he was shot in the 1981 attempt to assassinate President Reagan, required background checks for gun purchases from licensed gun dealers. Most private sales, including those at gun shows, don\u0027t require background checks. That\u0027s insanity.Read Post | Comments (372)Eric Boehlert, 12/17/12Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaBy going on Twitter and demanding Obama take action while Murdoch\u0027s highest profile property in the United States actively tries to silence debate about gun reform, the media baron either revealed himself to be a hypocrite of historic proportions, or clueless about Fox News\u0027 content.Read Post | CommentsDean Baker, 12/17/12Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027We have a group of rich business owners who are willing to lie, cheat and steal to get even richer. The greed of this elite has already had devastating consequences for the economy. But the latest attack on workers\u0027 rights in Michigan shows that they have no intention of backing off.Read Post | CommentsMichael Roth, 12/17/12President, Wesleyan UniversityReasonable law aimed at reducing violent deaths. Is that too much to ask? We know there are policies that have worked elsewhere -- in Australia, Japan, Great Britain. We will be told that these places are very different from us, and they are. That is no excuse.Read Post | CommentsGeorge Lakoff, 12/17/12Author, \u0027The Political Mind,\u0027 \u0027Moral Politics\u0027 and \u0027Don\u0027t Think of an Elephant!\u0027Conservatives have argued that guns \u003d freedom, and that there should be no limit on such freedom. The president trumped their argument: The price of not protecting the nations\u0027 children is too high. Permitting the mass murder of our children is not freedom.Read Post | Comments (267)Marlo Thomas, 12/17/12Award-winning actress, author and activistIt\u0027s always tempting to spend more money than we actually have during the holidays, so I reached out to my dear friend Suze Orman and asked her for some simple tips and ideas to keep us all from going over that financial gift cliff for the holidays!Read Post | CommentsRev. Al Sharpton, 12/17/12President, National Action NetworkPeople have been advocating for stiffer gun legislation for years, but now they have the momentum of the nation behind them. The question isn\u0027t when, why or how the media covers tragedies, but rather what we do in their aftermath.Read Post | Comments (22)Jim Wallis, 12/17/12Christian leader for social changeThis weekend, the nation was all grieving. Our church was packed on Sunday, as many congregations were across the country. You can feel the grieving, and it has brought us together. But what comes after the grief?Read Post | CommentsMatthew Dowd, 12/17/12Political strategistAnother tragedy confronts our country, and we wonder what we can do and how we can keep this from happening again. What we can do together in our hometowns, as those innocent children might have shown us if they were still laughing with their classmates?Read Post | CommentsJamie Henn, 12/17/12Co-founder and Communications Director, 350.orgWhile we welcome the debate over divestment, it\u0027s disappointing that Bryce and the Journal are leaving out key facts about the promise of renewables and Bryce\u0027s own industry affiliations.Read Post | CommentsEllen Johnson-Sirleaf and Ray Chambers, 12/17/12It would be a grave calamity to allow millions of children to lose their protection and wipe away our $10 billion investment to date by allowing resurgences in malaria to occur.Read Post | CommentsSerene Jones, 12/17/12President, Union Theological SeminaryAs our nation focuses on economic issues such as fiscal cliffs and tax rates, it is odd to see the topic of faith, underlying election issues just six weeks ago, recede completely from sight.Read Post | CommentsErnest Owens, 12/17/12Communication \u0026 Public Service major, University of PennsylvaniaIn my opinion, a great deal can be made as to why minorities feel \"lucky\" to be here and why others feel \"proud.\" Without realizing, this perspective has created a social racial inferiority complex that has hit the stratosphere of student interaction at Penn.Read Post | CommentsHeidi Grant Halvorson, Ph.D., 12/17/12Motivational psychologist and author, \u0027Succeed\u0027 and \"Nine Things Successful People Do Differently\"The difference between those who are successful and those who aren\u0027t is not whether or not you suffer from stress, but how you deal with it when you do. Here are nine scientifically-proven strategies for defeating stress whenever it strikes.Read Post | CommentsThrity Umrigar, 12/15/12Author, \u0027The Space Between Us\u0027Don\u0027t participate in any ritualized expressions of public grief. There have been so many of these already this year. The point is, they don\u0027t help. They don\u0027t change the laws of the land, they don\u0027t weaken the NRA, they don\u0027t frighten the cowardly politicians into action. They change nothing.Read Post | Comments (374)David Katz, M.D., 12/17/12Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterThis really has nothing to do with the Second Amendment, and certainly doesn\u0027t infringe on it. The Second Amendment doesn\u0027t say anything about what kind of \"arms\" we can bear. We are left, as a modern society with weapons unimagined in the days of our Founding Fathers, to figure that out for ourselves.Read Post | Comments (18)Jonathan L. Walton, 12/16/12Plummer Professor of Christian Morals and Pusey Minister in the Memorial Church of Harvard UniversityDespite the spectacle of terror that Americans have witnessed all too often in recent years, I still believe the best defense against violence is a better offense of love.Read Post | Comments (54)Robert Creamer, 12/16/12Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersThe tragedy in Connecticut forces America to confront a simple question: Why should we allow easy access to a weapon of mass destruction just because it could conceivably be referred to as a \"gun\"?Read Post | Comments (57)Leo W. Gerard, 12/17/12International President, United SteelworkersThe GOP in Michigan tried to position itself as the savior of workers, some sort of perverse Superman rescuing those who receive union benefits from the responsibility to help pay for union costs.Read Post | Comments (58)Daniel Ellsberg and John Perry Barlow, 12/16/12When a government becomes invisible, it becomes unaccountable. To expose its lies, errors, and illegal acts is not treason, it is a moral responsibility. Leaks become the lifeblood of the Republic.Read Post | Comments (22)Deepak Chopra, 12/17/12Co-author, \u0027Super Brain: Unleashing the Explosive Power of Your Mind to Maximize Health, Happiness, and Spiritual Well-Being\u0027; founder, The Chopra FoundationLincoln was beloved but also reviled; he could have gone down in history as a divisive leader more than a uniting one. The difference wasn\u0027t up to him. As he saw it, destiny worked through him. It will be fascinating to see if the same historical force is about to push America forward once more.Read Post | CommentsScott Mendelson, 12/17/12Film critic at Mendelson\u0027s Memos, Valley Scene MagazineThe Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey basically opened like a Lord of the Rings film, give or take various variables. Its $84.7 million estimated debut clobbered the December record.Read Post | CommentsBill Moyers and Michael Winship, 12/17/12We\u0027ve seen how Washington insiders write the rules of politics and the economy to protect powerful special interests but now, as we enter the holiday season, and a month or so after the election, we\u0027re getting a refresher course in just how that inside game is played, gifts and all.Read Post | Comments (11)Wendell Potter, 12/17/12Center for Public Integrity columnist, author, consultantPresident Obama said last year he would consider raising the eligibility age as part of a deal to cut federal spending. He\u0027s been silent on the issue so far this year, maybe because he\u0027s given it more thought.Read Post | Comments (30)Jordan K. Turgeon, 12/17/12Associate Blog Editor, The Huffington PostGetting up on a Saturday morning, lacing up my shoes and going for a run in Central Park was something I wanted in my life. So nearly 12 months ago, for my New Year\u0027s resolution, I decided I would not just \"learn to run\" but also complete a 5k race before the ball dropped on 2013.Read Post | CommentsStuart Diamond, 12/17/12Professor, The Wharton School; Author, \u0027Getting More: How You Can Negotiate to Succeed in Work \u0026 Life\u0027We are capable of so much that is great, in the arts, in science, in human relations, but it is all but drowned out because we can no longer judge right from wrong. We tolerate a system that once would never have been acceptable.Read Post | Comments (22)Tavis Smiley, 2012.17.12Nina Wegner, 2012.17.12Matthew Lieberman, 2012.17.12Lara M.
