{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"From thinkprogress.orgFrom news.aol.comFrom .hofesh.org.ilListening to the Bush administration\u0027s increasingly ridiculous attempts to spin the disastrous reality on the ground in Iraq, I\u0027m wondering if they\u0027ve hired the venerable messaging team of Ionesco, Beckett, and Genet. The theater of war meets the theater of the absurd. Here\u0027s Don Rumsfeld putting the blame for the White House\u0027s Iraq troubles squarely where it really belongs: \"I think the biggest problem we\u0027ve got in the country is people don\u0027t study history any more. People who go to school in high schools and colleges, they tend to study current events and call it history.\" There you have it, America\u0027s biggest problem when it comes to Iraq: lousy high school history teachers. Damn them!READ POST | comments (70)03.08.2006 David MametREAD POST03.08.2006 Robert ScheerIt is inconceivable that the facts of this publicly revered soldier\u0027s death were not transmitted to the top brass at the Pentagon and over to the White House.READ POST | comments (28)03.08.2006 Harry ShearerThe Democrats borrowed their new slogan from John Kerry, and now they\u0027re arguing about its syntax.
