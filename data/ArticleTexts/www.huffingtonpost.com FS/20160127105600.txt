{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor of sociology, University of California at BerkeleyBernie Sanders has significant vulnerabilities; describing yourself as a \"socialist\" calling for \"revolution\" who proposes to raise taxes on the middle class does not exactly seem the shortest route to the White House. But Sanders has surged ahead of Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire and moved into a virtual tie in Iowa, so the Clinton campaign has pulled out what it believes to be its trump card (no pun intended): that the 74-year-old Sanders is unelectable. To many, the argument seems compelling; he is, after all, a professed socialist who for most of his career refused to run as a Democrat. But plausible as the electability argument seems, the question remains: is it true?Bernie refuses to run the way that the pundits think he should. When questioned about the supposedly kryptonite topic of \"big government\" last night, he wasted no time in saying that he was going to bring back the era when government actually helped care for people. A leader is someone who figures out where the future is going -- not someone who joins the party once its underway.Author of a dozen books, including \u0027The End of Nature\u0027 and \u0027Deep Economy\u0027One essential factor in building a more inclusive prosperity is giving all Americans easy ways to save for their retirement years. That\u0027s why I have been thrilled to work on the unveiling of myRA--\"my Retirement Account\"--a game changer that will help Americans begin to save for a safe and comfortable retirement.Deputy Secretary of the United States Treasury DepartmentMary Beard\u0027s history of ancient Rome, SPQR: A History of Ancient Rome, offers disturbing lessons for 21st century America. Efforts to draw direct parallels can be too forced. But as countless commentators since Santayana have pointed out, failure to learn from history quite often guarantees repeat of its mistakes.United States Senator (Ret.)To all men and women serving our country, I know \"thank you\" isn\u0027t enough. You need jobs. You need someone to sit and talk with. You may need meds. Please know that you are loved and there are many, many podcasts out there you can listen to as you save our damned lives.Actor, Best Selling Author, and 2016 Grammy Nominated ComedianThe real difference is not between Clinton and the Republicans at large, but between Rubio and Cruz. This is worthy of serious debate -- indeed, it is central to the foreign policy identity of the Republican Party and, therefore, important to the country at large.Novelist and contributing opinion writerThe problem with \"digital democracy\" can be synthesized down to the willingness by those in power within the Bush and Obama administrations (and later, Google) to embrace the incomplete musings of a naïve young man -- Jared Cohen -- about issues he was ill-positioned to proffer.Author, \u0027Dangerous Ground\u0027Americans who understand the challenge of climate change had to be encouraged by the Paris summit where the nations of the globe, including the U.S., pledged to work together to dramatically reduce the burning of fossil fuels -- before it is too late to avoid disaster.Co-Director, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureIn recent elections the gender numbers are moving against the GOP. Even with a female running mate, Republican presidential nominee John McCain lost women to Obama by seven percentage points; four years later, Republican challenger Mitt Romney lost them by 12 percentage points.Political Correspondent, Time; Author, \u0027Broad Influence: How Women Are Changing the Way America Works\u0027To judge by the early returns, the presidential race of 2016 is shaping up as the most disheartening in recent memory. Other than as a form of low entertainment, the speeches, debates, campaign events, and slick TV ads already inundating the public sphere offer little of value.Author, \u0027The Limits of Power: The End of American Exceptionalism\u0027Business leaders have got to know that, ultimately, if Pence wins by promoting homophobic laws, it\u0027s a long-term loss for them.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostWe have been at war for half of my lifetime, nearly all of my daughter\u0027s lifetime. It is our state of being. Political elites speak only of more of it, as if proposing a hike in Social Security benefits. No one (credible) says, let\u0027s just get out of the Middle East.Executive Director, MIT Center for International StudiesA well-timed yes can expand our world in beautiful and unexpected ways. But I am writing now to espouse the power of another simple word: no.Actor, Author, Screenwriter, Director and ProducerWhen a home lacks running water, the government can and regularly does condemn the property or deem it inhabitable. You may think that this would never happen in America, but many people in the Flint area were forced out of their homes over the last few years for this very same reason.Currently representing Michigan\u0027s 49th House District including portions of Flint and surrounding communities.When some businesses block tough but truthful criticism, the trustworthiness of such reviews is diminished -- even for businesses that don\u0027t engage in the practice.United States Senator from South DakotaUnited States Senator from South DakotaThe swipe-to-reject sites models of popular dating sites can be utterly frustrating for people of color, because judgments based on photos are highly susceptible to the stereotypes and implicit biases that come into play when viewing photos of strangers.CEO of Siren Dating, artist, boundary crosser, optimistic pragmatistThe global financial crisis that shook virtually every country, government, and household in the world in 2008-09 gave way to a frustrating \"new normal\" of low growth, rising inequality, political dysfunction, and, in some cases, social tensions. Now this new normal is getting increasingly exhausted.Chief Economic Advisor, AllianzEighty percent of New Hampshire primary voters consider addressing prescription drug and other drug abuse and the recent surge in overdose deaths an important or urgent issue.Drug Policy Alliance, Director of National AffairsDear stranger who is so thankful to not to live my life, you seem to think I got coerced into spending my time with small children. I hang out with these little people on purpose. I might not always be a stay-at-home mom, but for now, I chose this.Humor blogger on parenting and life at Wonderoak.comCongratulations! You\u0027ve made it. You\u0027re one of a mere seven Republican hopefuls left standing in the final weeks before the Iowa and New Hampshire primaries. With skillful acting, manipulation, and perseverance (and lots and lots of money), you\u0027ll be sipping scotch in the oval office in no time.Freelance filmmaker and writerWhy are Texans safer yet feeling more vulnerable? Certainly, it\u0027s a manifestation of single-issue politics and the power of the National Rifle Association. But it also reflects the failure of political leadership and the triumph of the politics of fear.Author, teacher, university dean and provost at Binghamton UniversityOn behalf of all Muslim Americans, I urge you to rise above your unfounded fears and trust in the truth that implores you to accept us as equal citizens of this nation. Look past our hijabs and long beards and see the love we have in our hearts.Palestinian-American Muslim. Student. Humanitarian.The crucial oral argument before the Court this month is the Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, as well as several cases that the Court agreed to review later this year. With the president elected in November likely to select as many as four new Supreme Court justices beginning as early as next year, the person we elect as president will be critical. That\u0027s why Election Day 2016 will be Judgment Day for the Court and our rights and liberties.Senior Fellow, People For the American Way and People For the American Way FoundationIt\u0027s the inescapable conclusion of anyone who spends time in the far North that the challenge of coping with climate change looms over and interacts with just about every other issue and interest in the region. Over the past 60 years, Alaska has warmed about twice as fast as the rest of the United States.Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, and Chair of the Arctic Executive Steering CommitteeExecutive Director, Arctic Executive Steering Committee and former U.S. Ambassador to Sweden (2011-2015)If Bernie continues to gain support it\u0027s precisely because voters understand that the choice is clear -- accept the reality of plutocracy and beg for crumbs --- or fight to tear it down.Author, \"Runaway Inequality: An Activist\u0027s Guide to Economic Justice\"Wine is seen as something to figure out. Here\u0027s a secret: There is nothing to figure out. The more we make consumers afraid that they picked the wrong wine, the more we are doing a shitty job of selling wine overall.Wine writer, travel guide, photographer, CEO, conference organizer and speaker based in Porto, Portugal. ~ catavino.net dwcc.coSo what do I do when I lose the second most important man in my life after my father, who is the most important man and just left? I mourned, and I mourned deeply. But I knew I had to release him, with all my love, and my heart, because my brother was nothing else to me but love. I knew that any sense of sadness and regret would mar the sunshine he was for my life.Wedding photographer, snazzy photoboother, foodie and dog addict www.milouandolin.comMuch is said these days about the mismatch of missions and resources for the military. Indeed, the chants of neoconservatives on Capitol Hill have gotten quite loud: more military spending, more personnel, more weapons.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteIntroduced to the world as the daughter of President Ronald Reagan and Nancy Reagan, Patti Davis has created a legacy of her own as the New York Times bestselling author of eleven books.PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorThis view ignores the very real possibility that many of the qualities that make Cuba such a special destination can be maintained and even enhanced through sustainable development.Managing Director of Avila Strategies LLCTake time to really see people.
