I imagine she slept well that evening.READ POST01.27.2006 Steve SkrovanThe subject of Ralph Nader still engenders great passion. And I hope our movie engenders a lot of debate. I think it\u0027s a debate liberals need to have in order to move the agenda away from the fundamentalist right.READ POST01.27.2006 Jesse KornbluthI was probably the first writer approached by Ed Rollins to be his collaborator for his book Bare Knuckles and Back Rooms.
