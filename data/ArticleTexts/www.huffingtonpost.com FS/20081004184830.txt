Palin was just plain off the mark.Read Post | Comments (60)BIOCarl Bernstein, 10.03.2008Palin appeared to lack any semblance of the requisite depth, knowledge, or sense of history we should expect in a president or vice president. As a Republican former White House chief of staff said to me, \"Palin is evidence of desperation; she is an embarrassment.\"Read Post | Comments (225)BIOPeter Mehlman, 10.04.2008What\u0027s the point of television sports criticism? It\u0027s not like a Broadway Musical where a bad review may keep you from seeing it. The game is over.Read Post | Comments (12)BIOMichael Shaw, 10.04.2008With Obama opening up a strong lead in the polls, it\u0027s hard not to feel the Times is adhering to some juvenile rule of parity in which each candidate gets whacked in turn.Read Post | Comments (38)BIOJane Smiley, 10.04.2008No one knows if bombs William Ayers built actually killed anyone. Likewise, no one knows whether the bombs John McCain dropped on North Vietnam ever killed anyone -- though given the 23 bombing runs he flew, the odds are for it.Read Post | Comments (55)BIOMax Bernstein, 10.03.2008The decent person in me chimes in and says, \"I can\u0027t see how anyone could try to block a deployed soldier\u0027s right to vote and be able to live with themselves.\"Read Post | CommentsBIOSusan Kaiser Greenland, 10.03.2008I can understand why a whole lot of people who grew up in small town America, just as I did, really, really like Sarah Palin. But please, oh great white hunters of the Republican leadership, did you think we were morons?Read Post | Comments (166)BIOLincoln Mitchell, 10.04.2008Thought Palin exceeded expectations during the VP debate, she simply did not make a compelling case that she was ready to be president, or that she had the right solutions for America.Read Post | Comments (16)BIOJohn Ridley, 10.03.2008Despite his clear ability to energize and haul in buckets of cash, there continue to be elements to Obama\u0027s campaign which are troublesome harbingers of what kind of president he could be.Read Post | Comments (414)BIOSteven Weber, 10.03.2008Mike Huckabee is Fox News\u0027 version of Regis. And, after last night\u0027s final audition, he\u0027s got his Kathie Lee in Sarah \"Winky\" Palin. In six weeks, she\u0027ll be part of the most conspicuously moral duo on TV.Read Post | Comments (33)BIOWilliam Bradley, 10.03.2008So, you think it looks really good for Barack Obama. Well, maybe so. Yet, Obama can still lose this. Though I\u0027m not planning to head over to Vegas to shoot craps (John McCain\u0027s favorite) on that deal.Read Post | Comments (160)BIONora Ephron, 10.03.2008CNN had a graph running along the bottom of the screen during the debate, allegedly representing the moment-by-moment feelings of a group of independent voters.
