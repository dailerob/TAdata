{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureClinton is the most experienced and prepared candidate for the presidency in memory. But how plausible is it to believe that her experience and tenacity can enable her to work with Republicans to effect the change we need? No doubt, she\u0027ll be able to keep the government open. And we know there are bad deals that can be cut. But real reform? \"Revolution soon come\" may seem a fantasy. But Sanders\u0027 view that nothing will change unless people rise up, demand change, go to the polls in large numbers and hold their representatives accountable is compelling. And by not raising money from millionaires and billionaires, by not setting up a super PAC, by raising stunning sums in small donations, he isn\u0027t just calling for a popular movement, he is helping to build it.Our presumed good intentions allow us to rationalize destroyed hospitals, pulverized houses and children\u0027s corpses as preventable accidents, so long as we promise to try real hard to avoid such errors during the next blitz.Jeff Faux, author of The Servant EconomyThe quality of the questions was higher than has been the case with other debate spectacles in recent years. Yet CNN\u0027s self-censorship - in part reflected in the content of the questions and the favored positioning given to Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders - was not obscured.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorWhile I\u0027m pleased that we are seeing at least Democrats having a substantive discussion on the use of force in Middle East conflicts, it\u0027s still not the serious and comprehensive discussion about US policy in the Middle East we so desperately need.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Who is writing and influencing the history our children are taught? Should a few education officials in Texas or any state drive decisions about what all of our children learn or sugarcoat the truth?President, Children\u0027s Defense FundU.S. policy toward the People\u0027s Republic of China is an important political issue. Trade, proliferation, human rights, cyberwar, security, and more are at stake in how the existing superpower and emerging great power get along in coming years.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteThe United States is among the richest countries in all of history. But if you\u0027re not a corporate or political elite, you\u0027d never know it.Author, \"Runaway Inequality: An Activist\u0027s Guide to Economic Justice\"To fully appreciate how misguided such sponsorship is, it is worth reviewing what real, solid scientific research shows about the relation between soft drink consumption and the epidemic of obesity and diabetes now affecting children in the United States.Editorial Director, Union of Concerned ScientistsIf China fails to turbocharge its capacity to innovate, the country will experience a hard economic landing and social stability will be threatened. But can China evolve into an innovation powerhouse? The jury is out.CEO, JWT Asia PacificAllowing ill-defined \"extremist\" content to be removed without judicial oversight or due process can too easily be used by states interested in limiting independent reporting and staving off public policy debates.In addition to the rejectionist, veto caucus, I will also call these guys the \"white-washed caucus.\" As white-washed elected officials from white-washed districts, they want to keep America white, or white-controlled, for as long as they possibly can.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersWeeknight dinners should full of flavor, not fuss. These easy recipes prove that you can create healthy and delicious meals for your family with minimal hassle.Chef, Recipe Developer and Busy MomPundits already proclaimed who won (former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton), lost (Vice President Joe Biden) and broke even (former Maryland Gov.

Now that he is a lame duck, with no electoral challenges facing him, he should do the right thing for the country and his successor by pulling the plug on our failed military interventionsAuthor, \u0027The Lebanese Connection: Corruption, Civil War, and The International Drug Trade\u0027The big questions now that Bernie Sanders is contending for the Democratic presidential nomination are what has changed, and why is socialism still the old red herring for so many Americans who don\u0027t wear the GOP party label?Author and political analystThe great thing about this \"kid approved\" recipe is, the ratio of fruit to juice creates a perfect smoothie consistency. Not too thick and not too thin. Moms, Dads and adults 21 and over, feel free to add a shot of rum - a lovely elixir for your lazy weekend mornings.Private chef, culinary school graduate and second-generation foodieBernie blew it. By embracing rather than confronting Hillary Clinton, Sen. Sanders fell into the trap of sellout mainstream politics, improving his personal brand as an appealing but ultimately non-threatening advocate for the downtrodden while studiously avoiding any suggestion that the smiley-faced woman standing next to him is deeply complicit in Wall Street\u0027s rape of the nation.Editor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027They Know Everything About You\u0027All of those little mis-gendered pronouns and mis-gendered references to those of us who are already struggling to become or stay positive about our lives can be really destructive. And yes, just because you didn\u0027t mean for them to be, they are very hurtful.truckdriver,writer, musician, transwoman.This month marks one year since Ferguson October, a mass mobilization in St. Louis calling for justice for Michael Brown Jr. and an end to police brutality. Hundreds marched together, including a delegation of Palestine activists who gathered to stand with the struggle for Black liberation.Palestinian American organizerTruth teller, Justice seeker, Freedom fighter, Griot, Human rights activistBernie Sanders\u0027 open dismissal of capitalism makes him pretty much unelectable in a general election, and thus a disaster for the Democratic party, if they were to nominate him for president. This is my opinion as a political scientist, and does not reflect an anti-left bias.Playwright and Political Science Professor; Writing Fellow at Quinnipiac UniversityMany people charged with illegal reentry are like my father - people who have lived in the US for years and who are desperate to return to the US to be with their families.Third-year law student at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, CaliforniaIn Georgia, we have been victorious in deterring powerful outsider groups from interfering in our local politics and stopping important legislation. Unfortunately, this is only the beginning. One of the best ways you can make a difference is by starting at home and implementing a family policy of the 4 R\u0027s -- Reuse, reduce, recycle and refuse!Chairperson, The Captain Planet FoundationOnly after living in South Africa have I been able to truly humanize my understanding of America\u0027s, and therefore my own, discrimination. For the first time, I see the greatness of the American dream clearly: deflated by moral contradiction.WondererAlthough the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been around for generations, it still has the capacity to surprise. Even the experts are confused by the current violence that has been roiling Jerusalem for weeks nowResearch Associate Professor of Israel Studies and Executive Director of the Gildenhorn Institute for Israel Studies at the University of MarylandDays ago, US Treasury Secretary Lew asked whether our nation would \"muster the political will to avoid the self-inflicted wounds that come from a political stalemate.\" There\u0027s only one economically sound answer: Congress must raise the debt ceiling, end the sequester, put more people to work, and increase our investment in education and infrastructure.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027The world chess champion Magnus Carlsen came to Berlin this month to defend his other two world titles: in the rapid and blitz play. The Norwegian grandmaster succeeded marvelously in the three-day rapid event, finishing undefeated and scoring 11.5 points in 15 games.International Chess GrandmasterEvery day a variation of this quote comes from Bernie Sanders\u0027 upstart presidential campaign.
