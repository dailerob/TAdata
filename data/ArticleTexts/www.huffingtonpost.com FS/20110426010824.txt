{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressA Fox Nation story today led to complaining about the Obama White House\u0027s failure to issue a proclamation about Easter. Never mind that the White House did host an Easter Egg Roll, and the president also hosted an Easter-themed prayer breakfast. Also lost amid this nonsense is the fact that Obama\u0027s predecessor didn\u0027t \"proclaim\" anything Easter related either.
