{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AriannaWelcome to the Huffington Post, which, as our motto says, has been delivering news and opinion since, well, a few hours ago.

And don’t forget to check out Eat the Press, Harry Shearer’s spicy dish about the media. So come in and make yourself at home.05.09.2005 Larry DavidI know this may not sound politically correct, but as someone who has abused and tormented employees and underlings for years, I am dismayed by all of this yammering directed at John Bolton. Let\u0027s face it, the people who are screaming the loudest at Bolton have never been a boss and have no idea what it’s like to deal with nitwits as dumb as themselves all day long. Why, even this morning my moronic assistant handed me a cup of coffee with way too much milk in it. I was incensed.Read whole post.permalink05.09.2005 Walter CronkiteThe Democratic Party should organize a convention this year to debate and resolve a platform that would provide the confused electorate some idea of what the party stands for…a regretfully missing ingredient in the politics of the moment.Read whole post.permalink05.09.2005 Sen. Jon CorzineI just saw first-hand how terrorists are made. Mix together a genocide, a civil war, oil, a failed state, and non-intervention by the global community until it is too late. And voila.Read whole post.Author Bio | permalink05.09.2005 Tina Brown-- Insincere smiles are strangely hard to do even after years of practice at cocktail parties. Insincere smiles even harder to do when listening with fascination to guest speak about his theories about class warfare and producer is saying into earpiece “Blah. Blah. Can’t you put a bomb up his ass?”Read whole post.permalink05.09.2005 Arianna HuffingtonIf DeLay and his pious pals had been around for the Sermon on the Mount, perhaps the most famous line about humility ever spoken would have been given a rewrite: \"Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth… unless the pushy hire Jack Abramoff at 750 shekels an hour; then the meek (and the Indians) are screwed.\" Luckily, Jesus was able to stick to the original script.Read whole post.permalink05.09.2005 Rep. Ed MarkeyToday, I will join Hans Blix at the United Nations for a discussion on the need to balance disarmament and non-proliferation. The real \"nuclear option\" that threatens our national security is not the one being debated in the Senate – this nuclear option will end in a devastating plume of smoke over our cities.Read whole post.Author Bio | permalink05.09.2005 Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Brad HallLook around and you’ll see the gays getting gay-married all over the place, and, to quote, well, everyone: gay marriage destroys real marriage. Now, when I come home to my wife, I feel nothing. How could I? SHE COULD BE A MAN. Thanks a lot, gays.Read whole post.Author Bio | permalink05.09.2005 Mike NicholsI think that metaphor is in trouble. To take the bible literally, as fundamentalists do, is an attack on the greatest collection of metaphors we have. We need metaphor as we need stories. We need stories that mean more than just the events that transpire in them. Anyone who has read to children knows that the development of their entire personalities requires stories beyond the literal. They are the only way to understand and develop ideas. If we have, as de Tocqueville predicted, become pure market forces then we need to do CPR on metaphor pretty fast. Dr. King knew that an improved reality begins with a dream. In dreams begin responsibilities.Read whole post.Author Bio | permalink05.09.2005 John CusackWent to Hunter S. Thompson’s memorial service in Aspen. The next day, we went to Owl Farm -- which remained untouched since Hunter’s death two weeks before. The sun was shining and gunfire echoed as friends and family gathered and shot targets on the lawn. Norman Greenbaum’s “Spirit in the Sky” booming. Books, notes, numbers, pills, bullets, totems and talismans everywhere. Outside his wife offered liquid acid to people in the driveway. In the kitchen where he took his life, a huge American flag overlooked his suicide. He was looking right at it.Read whole post.permalink05.09.2005 Ellen DeGeneresHere is something you might want to know: Late last year, Congress did away with a 34 year old regulation banning the government from selling any of the 37,000 wild horses running free across America’s western plains. Since the new rule was adopted, the Bureau of Land Management has sold over a thousand horses to private parties. At least 41 of them have been slaughtered and turned into dog food.Read whole post.Author Bio | permalink05.09.2005 David MametI understand that computers, which I once believed to be but a hermaphrodite typewriter-cum-filing cabinet, offer the cyber literate increased ability to communicate.

In fact, it’s one of his favorite shows…well, maybe if he didn’t have two daughters to watch it with him, he wouldn’t be as interested, but nonetheless he is the first to plant himself in front of that TV come Tuesday night. Which brings me to the reason for this post: Detroit still doesn’t get it.Read whole post.Author Bio | permalink05.08.2005 Harry ShearerWelcome to \"Eat the Press\". My name is Harry, I\u0027ll be your server. Everything\u0027s fresh, except the stuff that\u0027s been on the site since beta testing, but that\u0027s good, too. A little about the menu. The appetizers are what I like to call \"Found Objects\", pieces of audio and/or video that illustrate the news-making process at work. Media people have always delighted in presenting us with the incautiously recorded moments of politicians and celebrities; this section represents just a tasty bit of table-turning. These pieces are presented raw, and without unnecessary chopping, so enjoy. For the entrees we have for you the freshest looks at the stories the media is covering, why and how they\u0027re covering them, and what they\u0027re not covering. We\u0027ve taken off the menu both the \"gee, we did the horserace story again too often during the campaign\" dishes and the extra-salty \"they\u0027re biased against the left/they\u0027re biased against the right\" stews you may have been gorging on lately. In the spirit of the venue, we\u0027re looking for your observations and contributions. If you\u0027re in the media business, and have a tasty story of the...Read whole post.Posted at 12:00 PM | permalink","h1":"HUFFINGTON POST EXCLUSIVE: EMBARGOED BOOK CLAIMS SAUDI OIL INFRASTRUCTURE RIGGED FOR CATASTROPHIC SELF-DESTRUCTION",".title":"","h2":"On The Blog NowWhy I Support John BoltonDemocrats: What Do They Stand For?How to Stop a Genocide10 Things I Learned at Topic AWhat Would Jesus Do...
