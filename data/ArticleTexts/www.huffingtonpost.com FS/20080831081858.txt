{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOPicking Sarah Palin was clearly a Hail Mary pass. But the McCain campaign is tapping into an archetype that resonates deep in the human psyche. That of the unknown innocent plucked from obscurity and magnificently rising to the challenge. Hollywood has long recognized the appeal of this fantasy. Think Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, A Face in the Crowd, Dave, Mr. Deeds Goes to Town. So in questioning Palin, it\u0027s not enough for Democrats to mock the smallness of Wasilla, Alaska or shout, \"it\u0027s insulting,\" \"it\u0027s ridiculous,\" \"it\u0027s pathetic.\" They must make the case that given the gulf between the crises we face and her capacity to handle them, this is a truly dangerous choice. Forget Dan Quayle. Palin is more Harriet Miers -- chosen for all the wrong reasons, and glaringly not up to the task. Maybe an anxious nation can offer John McCain a do-over.Read Post | CommentsBIOHarry Shearer, 08.30.2008Is money the reason New Orleans has to wait three more years before even the semblance of protection is in place?
