{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Executive Director, ACLU (1978-2001, Retired) and President of the Drug Policy Alliance BoardSlavery was America\u0027s original sin; it poisoned the blood and infected the bones of our polity, and that poison remains, still doing its sinful work. If we believe what we were taught in school about America as the land of freedom and equal opportunity, about all of us -- all of us -- being equally endowed with inalienable rights, about the purpose of government, as declared in the Declaration of Independence, being to secure those rights, then we have a lot of work still to do. We remain very far from a post-racial country.The boundary separating white Anglo upscale school districts from the burgeoning non-white and non-Anglo populations in downscale communities is fast becoming a flashpoint inside America.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027We also need to better detect and treat mothers who suffer from depression. We have strong evidence that untreated depression in moms impairs their attachment to their children and is associated with these children developing behavioral and emotional problems in childhood. If the moms are properly treated not only do they do better, so do their kids.Medical director, New York State Office of Mental HealthParticularizing \"rape on campus\" in the search for real and lasting prevention and solutions will not solve the problem of rape on campus. The culture that enables rape is the broader one of male dominance, violence and exploitation.Feminist, writer, and satirist (not always in that order)Because of the great social implications of cases involving police shootings of people of color, the presumption in these cases should be that prosecutors utilize the public preliminary hearing process instead of the secret grand jury proceeding.Professor, Thomas Jefferson School of LawYou see, I felt like bowing down to that belly. I felt like celebrating it and thanking it for what it had carried -- for whom it had carried.Writer, MamaBeanParenting.comFrom 12 to 50 it\u0027s assumed we\u0027re packing, assumed that like the Hulk or zombies we possess superhuman, virtually unstoppable destructive power. So where an average citizen may disagree, even argue and berate a police officer, treating them as the public servant that they indeed are, a black man, if he wishes to continue living, must channel his ancestors.Novelist, Screenwriter, and Associate Professor at Columbia UniversityOn this Thanksgiving weekend please continue to give thanks but also receive some thanks for yourself, for you undoubtedly are the best you are capable of becoming.Host and Producer of Between the Lines with Barry Kibrick seen on PBS.Through daily moral consciousness we must all counter the proliferating voices of racial and ethnic and religious division that are regaining too much respectability over the land.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundA native of St Louis, long a New York City expat, I less felt anger than shame at the inevitability of it all. Performers cast in a familiar play with specific roles to play once the curtain went up.Advocate, journalist and lecturerArabs should be reassured that their concerns are understood by the West. At the same time, the Iranian public needs to see the linkage between their economic woes and their government\u0027s nuclear ambitions and foreign policy.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027One of the prevailing things I noticed on that fateful night was the high volume of teens who were speaking out and explaining why this isn\u0027t just about one of our peers -- it\u0027s a bigger societal indication about civil rights and the racism that still exists in America.18-year-old high school senior in Colorado SpringsI want to offer a special thanks to the technologists of the world -- all those who work anonymously in the world\u0027s labs and engineering departments to come up with the circuits, code, and contraptions that have combined to change life as I know it.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarWe now all have the chance to examine the evidence -- released last night -- in the grand jury\u0027s decision not to indict white police officer Darren Wilson, who fired multiple bullets into Michael Brown. But the verdict on America\u0027s criminal justice system is already in for many Americans: guilty, for treating young black men differently than young white men.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersBusiness school may be the right decision for any one individual, but I find it increasingly hard to see why the real leaders of the future will continue to choose this path. An MBA is a form of insurance; a highly-conservative move to hedge against risk.Healthcare StrategyEvery strategy toward the DPRK so far seems to have failed. Anything adopted is likely to be only a second best. However, today even second best would be a major step forward. It\u0027s time for Washington to try something different.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteOnly empathy, which is the root of morality, can bring victory. And that is only possible when we love one another. If we want to understand the fears of our sisters and brothers we have to love some people deeply enough to know them as sisters and brothers and empathize with their fears.Startup CEO and Market-Loving ProgressiveMany American children won\u0027t have a safe, stable home this holiday season. Homelessness among families with children isn\u0027t an intractable problem; federal rental assistance -- like the Housing Choice Voucher program -- is an effective solution. But funding is seriously inadequate and has faced significant cuts.Senior Policy Analyst, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesWe are in a state of emergency, a time of challenge and controversy, but not because of the protestors. That state of emergency will continue until we stand, become uncomfortable, and demand a justice system that addresses the manifestation of pain in protest, the further chipping away of respect, and the real state of emergency our country faces.Director of African American Religious Affairs, People For the American Way and People For the American Way FoundationLiving on an island in the Caribbean for two years has taught me many valuable lessons I may not have learned living Stateside. In case you aren\u0027t currently basking in tropical sunshine like me, allow me to impart some of my newfound wisdom.Freelance writer, blogger at www.awalkontherun.com, currently living the expat dream life in Roatan, Honduras.Yes, it\u0027s that time of year again. Online shoppers will spend countless hours in front of their computer screens to get the best Cyber Monday deals. If you don\u0027t like waiting in long lines, this may be your only chance to get those holiday shopping discounts.AuthorI don\u0027t think the fate of Darren Wilson as a human being really means anything to the ruling class. At the end of the day, people like Bob McCulloch aren\u0027t protecting Wilson so much as the system that he stood for.Author, \u0027Tear Down This Myth\u0027So as we once again enter the holiday season with its inherent stresses and strains, especially on interfaith families, here are some of the most persistent questions that I am asked each year regarding how to make interfaith marriage work.Author, \u0027Becoming Jewish: The Challenges, Rewards, and Paths to Conversion\u0027 and \"A Nonjudgmental Guide to Interfaith Marriage\"Thanksgiving is all about giving thanks, and being grateful and kind is not something we should restrict to this time of year. It\u0027s a gift that keeps on giving all year long -- not just for those we interact with, but for ourselves as well.AuthorYou don\u0027t have to feel like an outsider this holiday season. Join the party and live full out. Just make sure you devote more time to your health than you do to your indulgences and then you can start your New Year without any guilt for how you ended this year.National fitness expert, speaker, contributor to Prevention magazine, author of several books and fitness DVDsEven if the federal government declines to prosecute Wilson, it is highly probable that the Justice Department under a 1994 federal law will take the Ferguson police department to federal court itself. Once there, upon a showing of a pattern of civil rights violations, they can force reforms under consent decrees with federal monitors.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityWhen it comes to Thanksgiving, librarians enjoy pumpkin pie and the Thanksgiving Day Parade as much as the next person. But it should come as no surprise that for the librarians at The New York Public Library, one of the things they\u0027re most thankful for are books.Creating the library for the futureIn some places, the police seem, and act, like an occupying force. If the law does not represent you but only governs you, you are a subject, not a citizen. So what are the \"blessings\" that Americans should \"gratefully acknowledge,\" as Abraham Lincoln put it in the 1863 proclamation creating the first national Thanksgiving?Professor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027As we sit around our holiday table, we can celebrate the manifold opportunities to teach our parents, children, grandchildren and guests that it would be a terrible waste of life if all we focused on was our own personal blessings without simultaneously raising to consciousness all that needs \u0027tikkun.\u0027Editor, Tikkun MagazineThis year the day after Thanksgiving will be remembered not as the biggest shopping day of the year but as the day Americans took action to demand that Walmart, the country\u0027s largest employer, pay workers livable wages and play a part in improving our economy.E.P.
