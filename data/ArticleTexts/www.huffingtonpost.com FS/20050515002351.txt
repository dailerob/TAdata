I’ll be blogging from the motherland over the weekend and keeping tabs with my new Siemens SX66 Pocket PC Phone.Starting off our weekend jam, we have postings from Debrah Constance, Marc Cooper, Torie Osborn, Jon Robin Baitz, and an adults only blog from Robert Evans.Yassou, for now!05.14.2005 Robert EvansHave you ever been involved in a ménage a trois? Well, while putting together an expose of the porn biz for Sirius Satellite Radio, I found myself smack in the center of an experience that’s thought of as strictly taboo… And where did this clandestine rendezvous take place? Well, I hate to say it, but right here in the bed of the notorious Robert Evans -- that’s me, pal.read whole post | author bio | permalink05.14.2005 Ze FrankIf the nuclear option passes, the Dems have threatened to filibuster an up or down vote on John Bolton in the Senate. Since Bolton\u0027s post is not in the judiciary, filibustering remains an option.Here\u0027s my problem: filibustering doesn\u0027t make for good TV.read whole post | author bio | permalink05.14.2005 Irshad ManjiBritain\u0027s Labour Party gets re-elected to a majority with only 36% of the vote. The Republicans take the White House again with just over 50% of the vote. Meanwhile, Abu Mazen\u0027s Palestinian Authority forms a government with a full 60% of the vote. Does this make the Palestinian government more legitimate than its American or British counterparts..?read whole post | author bio | permalink05.13.2005 Arianna HuffingtonIn touting their proposal (which, by the way, isn’t really theirs [pdf]), Gingrich said e-health care info systems would eliminate medical mistakes caused by illegible prescription orders. “Paper kills,” he warned ominously.

The flesh of these fish traps a lot of heavy metals and this metal accumulation might be toxic to a fetus, young children and maybe everyone else.read whole post | author bio | permalink05.14.2005 Richard CarlsonAn occasional peak at the amount of money the Saudi’s spend to maintain themselves can boggle the mind. An example is the recent trip by Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah to meet with President Bush (and walk hand in hand through the tumbleweeds) for a day at the Bush ranch in Crawford, Texas, chatting about oil prices, the Lebanese parliamentary elections and topics they have kept to themselves.read whole post | permalink05.14.2005 Richard BradleyGiambi\u0027s clearly having mental problems, and it\u0027s painful to watch, in the same way that second baseman Chuck Knoblauch\u0027s throwing problems were.

But you can’t do both, especially if you are afraid to venture more than 45 minutes away from a TV green room.read whole post | author bio | permalink05.13.2005 David CornIt was so heartwarming to see DeLay and the other conservatives singing out Pete Seeger\u0027s \"If I Had a Hammer\".

But to me, his bike riding is in fact a provocation; he has entirely mastered a kind of perfect anti-gravitas. And maybe there’s something obscene about it all, when the bike riding is accompanied by so much willful, stonewalled blankness and good old-boy apercu.read whole post | author bio | permalink05.12.2005 Bruce CohenIt is 2 am.

Is it coincidence that in the era when it was forbidden at CBS News to describe their output as \"shows\" (they had to be referred to as \"broadcasts\") one never saw news footage slo-mo\u0027d or accompanied by mood music? Tell it to Art Bell.Dateline-lying is another such small change that has larger meaning.People have been fired from major newspapers for putting datelines on stories when they were nowhere near the place the story occurred--or, at best, when they flew in just to plant their feet on the newsy soil for the purpose of claiming the dateline. Yet, in TV and radio news, dateline-lying is becoming more and more common.Every time you hear a report end with \"....Jim Schmeman, NBC News\" as opposed to the name of the place where the event occurs, you\u0027re hearing a subtle form of the nefarious act.
