{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor of Journalism, Northeastern University, BostonThe third Republican presidential primary debate was a sprawling, messy affair that played out more as a battle between candidates and moderators than an exchange among the debaters. At this point the key problem is the sheer number of human beings on stage: it is virtually impossible to design a format that accommodates this many people -- ten candidates and a whopping six questioners. CNBC may not have deserved the bruising its journalists took, but the network must shoulder the blame for devising such an unsatisfying structure. With the Republican debate miniseries now officially one-third over, it is time for the producers to alter their approach.In watching the debate, I kept thinking to myself, \"These are the job applicants for the position of CEO of the World.\" Yet there was more carnival barking on the stage than insights or observations about the economy or economic policy.Senior Fellow at New America, author of \"Raw Deal: How the \u0027Uber Economy\u0027 and Runaway Capitalism Are Screwing American Workers\"We know that more than 90 percent of Americans support common-sense reforms that are proven to save lives. What not enough people know and what the gun lobby doesn\u0027t want more of us to know is that a large majority of gun owners support these reforms too.ActressThe Party of Putin does not know, or pretend not to know, that Putin is an empire builder surrounded by ideologues whose vision of the world, though complex and robust, is in all key respects opposed to that of the West.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.Republicans must thoughtfully engage with Black Lives Matter if they desire to gain African American votes from the Democrats. Empty rhetoric will not suffice, and the silence of the GOP on issues that disproportionately impact African Americans cannot continue unabated without dire consequences for the future of the GOP.Masters of Divinity candidate at Westminster Theological Seminary in PhiladelphiaWe ought not to be blinded by media theater, or by habits of dismissing the doubts, and even the deaths, of countless people just like ourselves, overseas, whenever our government offers us its unsubstantiated explanations, its sincere good will, its apologies.Co-coordinator, Voices for Creative Nonviolence\"It\u0027s the humane thing to do,\" said a participant following an emergency donor class conference call following the CNBC Republican debate in Boulder, Colo. \"After Jeb criticized Rubio\u0027s attendance record, and Rubio broke his legs, you could just see it in his eyes.\"USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorWe of course can\u0027t be satisfied just growing OGP and growing the model. We\u0027ve got to keep this organization fluid and vibrant and responsive to what citizens are asking for around the world.U.S. Permanent Representative to the United NationsThe country is in a fundamentally different place than it was 15 years ago when the Supreme Court handed George W. Bush the White House. If Kasich is able to win the Republican nomination -- that will be tough since GOP voters have no appetite for emotions other than anger -- his attempts at expressing empathy in the fall will be unconvincing when Americans learn about his record in Ohio.Syndicated Columnist and Longtime Political StrategistMudslinging is no new phenomenon in modern presidential elections. But for the first time ever, it\u0027s juxtaposed with a new style of campaigning: Bernie Sanders\u0027 style.Technology Analyst at R/GAMost people mistake their own perspective, shaped by their subjective and limited perception, for the absolute reality of the external world. Questioning this assumption is what advanced our research on dark matter. It is also the only thing that has ever advanced human empathy.Physics Professor, Harvard University; Author, \u0027Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs: The Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe\u0027Wednesday night\u0027s Republican presidential debate brings to mind one of the most memorable TV snafus in history: the 27-minute loss of audio during the first presidential debate between incumbent Republican President Gerald Ford and Democratic challenger Jimmy Carter.Senior writer, BillMoyers.com.

The optimism of children and adolescents is understandable, but even when you find community on the internet you cannot simply assume that your parents and peers will support you.Executive Director, Gender Rights MarylandWe\u0027re told to fake it till we make it. Nonsense. I can\u0027t believe how many people tell me how well their company is doing, and three months later it\u0027s out of business. If only they had shared their challenges, maybe I or someone in their network could have helped.I like to make stuff on computers. CEO of Highrise and maker of Draft.Superheroes are needed in this world, just as you are needed in this world. The best part about these fictitious characters is that when you strip away all the powers they have, they are just people like you and me, faults and all.Best Selling Author, Speaker, BloggerWhat reportedly happened in that Spring Valley classroom is a prime example of the consequences of having a routine police presence in schools.Advocacy and Policy Strategist, ACLUAfter an impressive Democratic Party debate earlier this month, Republicans realized their earlier performances looked worse, by contrast. So they took several steps during their third debate to emulate the Democratic candidates, even if they claimed to despise them.Political science professor, LaGrange College in GeorgiaThere is a difference between being inspired by an indigenous culture and appropriating it, especially while that culture is very much alive; which brings me to the endless stream of Pocahotties and headdresses seen at almost every Halloween party or street parade.Native American/British, Feminist, IS/Transgender AdvocateTo target your back and core, we\u0027ve got a quick back workout you can do anywhere, no equipment necessary. It\u0027s time to get your back on track.Health and fitness articles to help you live a healthier, happier and more active lifestyle.

That, however, was not -- and still is not -- the case.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUWhat father raising his male child without a mother would feel like he\u0027d succeeded in raising him the way his mother would have wanted, if he grew up to believe he was somehow superior to the opposite sex?Author of Sunday Times Bestseller \u0027It\u0027s Not Raining, Daddy, It\u0027s Happy\u0027 and writer of the award-winning blog \u0027Life as a Widower\u0027A total of 854 people have already been executed in the Islamic Republic in the first 10 months of 2015, according to the Iran Human Rights Documentation Center (IHRDC), which records \"unofficial,\" \"semiofficial\" and \"official\" executions.Vocativ - news sourced from the deep web.\"How come your arms are all wrinkled up?\" the little girl asks.

Underlying the entire discussion was a sense that no one in the room knows all the relevant facts.Senior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstDoes Dr. Carson really believe he is the father of some retro revolution in which men regain control of women, making us see the error of our waywardness? Women are so far past that that it\u0027s a joke, which is why abortion should not even be in question. Wake up, Dr. Carson.Actress and authorThe number of school-related arrests is often linked to the proliferation of \"zero-tolerance\" policies in education. Zero-tolerance policies represent those that strike immediate consequences for any kind of misbehavior by students, regardless of the circumstances.Activist, Freelance Writer and Child Welfare AdvocateThere are no do-overs or reboots, and our primary job as parents is to lay a solid foundation for our children\u0027s future. I want more for my son. I expect more of my son -- and so should his school. My kids are not an experiment for a foundering system.Deputy director of audience engagement, Los Angeles TimesRecent reports indicate renewed interest by Russian submarine forces in surveillance of our undersea fiber optic cables.
