{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"After nearly ten years of talk about tracking down Osama bin Laden, it\u0027s finally happened. And it\u0027s amazing how different the world suddenly feels -- at least for the moment. Coming at a time in which the country is all but paralyzed politically, in which 70 percent feel the country is on the wrong track, and in which real solutions to our problems seem beyond us, there is tremendous spillover power in this accomplishment. Can this real and tangible victory produce conditions that can lead to more successes? The mission to bring bin Laden to justice was a great victory and a testament to the brave soldiers who carried it out. And there\u0027s no reason why this sense of tangible achievement must end in Abbottabad.Read Post | CommentsMalou Innocent, 05.04.2011Foreign Policy Analyst, Cato InstitutePakistan wants to have its cake and eat it too, much like a cheating spouse.

Henigan, 05.04.2011Brady Center Vice President and Author of \"Lethal Logic\"The NRA needs average Americans to believe that the threat of attack is constant and pervasive.

Carolyn Maloney, 05.04.2011Congresswoman from New YorkCongress has created the CFPB with so much oversight that calls for \"improving\" the CFPB are unfair to all of us who use financial services.

Bush also gave a clarion call for action. He told us to \"go shopping.\" That was his moment, and that was his prescription for America. Now Barack Obama has his moment. What will he use it for?Read Post | CommentsImam Feisal Abdul Rauf, 05.04.2011Chairman, Cordoba InitiativeAs our president reminded us, bin Laden did not represent Islam. The Quran explicitly states that no soul shall be responsible for the sins of another. Terrorism, which targets innocents who had no part in a crime, fundamentally violates this Quranic commandment.Read Post | CommentsRep. Bruce Braley, 05.04.2011U.S. Representative from Iowa’s 1st DistrictHouse Resolution 3 represents an unprecedented rollback of women\u0027s rights by sneaking in a backdoor provision to reintroduce language that redefines rape.
