{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Josh SilverDirector, Represent.UsElections have become auctions, and nearly every issue is paralyzed by the overwhelming influence of money. But you knew that. The real challenge is how to fix what has become one of our nation\u0027s most pressing political challenges. Despite noble efforts, the public interest community has made little headway over the past 40 years. To break that losing streak, it requires that we rethink reform strategies and go big. Really big. And it requires that we replace cynicism about prospects for success with recognition that giving up is tantamount to giving up on the future of our nation. Democracy cannot and will not survive unless reformers and philanthropists rethink reform completely. The stakes are that high.CommentsLawrence KorbSenior Fellow, Center for American ProgressAs we mark the painful anniversary of what the late Ted Sorensen called the Bush administration\u0027s \"mindless, needless, senseless\" invasion and occupation of Iraq, none of the architects of the war have yet publicly apologized for their dereliction of duty. In fact, many of them have taken the opposite tack.CommentsLisa BelkinSenior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, The Huffington PostUntil we find that new path, women (and men) who can afford to step off the existing path, will continue to do so. And we will have the cover story equivalent of \"Groundhog Day\" -- as each new cohort finds itself conflicted for the first time.Comments (80)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesAre GOP leaders secretly hoping that the Supreme Court, after it hears arguments on marriage equality next week, rules in favor of equality? The GOP\u0027s only hope, it seems, is for the Supreme Court to take the issue off the table entirely.Comments (186)Richard A. ClarkeFormer Advisor to the President on Cyber SecurityOn Tuesday, at this 10th anniversary of the American Invasion of Iraq, we would do well to remind ourselves about some painful facts. So, let us recall five unfortunate facts about the U.S. invasion of Iraq.Comments (151)Robert BrusteinPlaywright, director, actor, educator, theater founderI\u0027ve known Phil now for almost all of his writing life, beginning in the sixties, when he used to eat a lot of dinners at the New York apartment of me and my late wife Norma. In fact, one of Phil\u0027s best comic turns was at my expense, and took place on Martha\u0027s Vineyard during one of his many visits there.CommentsJames MooreBest selling author, Director of Progress Texas PACThe timing was a thing of pure political beauty. President George W. Bush was only a few days away from speaking to the United Nations\u0027 General Assembly about Iraq\u0027s renewed efforts to acquire banned weaponry.Comments (24)Jon SoltzCo-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranWar is not a game, and the statistics are not just numbers. These are real people, with real lives, and real families. The best thing we can do, today, is to remember their stories.Comments (29)Arianna HuffingtonThe American workplace shows a seriously split-screen world. On the one hand, there\u0027s the stressful world of quarterly earnings reports, beating growth expectations, hard-charging CEOs, and focusing on the bottom line. On the other hand, there\u0027s the world populated by the growing awareness of the costs of stress, not just in the health and well-being of business leaders and employees, but on the bottom line as well.Comments (99)Jedediah PurdyProfessor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027The Supreme Court will rule for nationwide marriage equality by a 6-3 vote. That\u0027s my prediction. This is premature, more than a week before the Justices hear arguments, but here are my reasons -- good, bad, and ugly. If it does happen, this will be why.Comments (205)Grover NorquistPresident, Americans for Tax ReformThe Fourth Amendment -- the one that is supposed to keep the government out of your mail and outside your door -- is one area that can unite grownups of the left and right.CommentsDavid RockDirector, NeuroLeadership InstituteWhen you understand the underlying physiology of mindfulness, you begin to see that any discussion about human change, learning, education, even politics and social issues, ends up being about mindfulness.Comments (12)Kimberly BrooksArtist www.kimberlybrooks.comI\u0027m thrilled today to unveil and launch the ImageBlog, a communal platform for artists from all over the world to share and engage. Featured artists submit images of their work -- in whole, in detail, or in progress -- with a caption of any length, but unlike a blog, the image is paramount.CommentsRichard (RJ) EskowWriter; host, \u0027The Breakdown\u0027; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureDavid Brooks may not understand economics or public policy, but his uninformed pronouncements have a music that moves Washington insiders. These uncomprehending arias may have comic-opera overtones, but they build a consensus for tragedy.Comments (15)Marianne SchnallWriter/InterviewerThe dynamic 72-year-old acclaimed actor and activist has taken on his own personal mission: enlisting men in the movement to end violence against women, which he has called, \"the single greatest human rights violation of our generation.\"Comments (64)Alec BaldwinActorHow do I convey this without offending the gay community, or women who are supportive of more women in politics, or those who believe that Michael Bloomberg was a great mayor for New York? It may be impossible, but here goes. Christine Quinn is not qualified to be mayor of New York.Comments (354)Jacquie JonesExecutive Director, National Black Programming ConsortiumIt\u0027s time to address the top-down, mostly privately-funded school reform \"movement\" currently shaping our national education policy and the impact it\u0027s having on black and brown and, most especially, poor children.Comments (25)Karen S. ExkornBest-selling author/corporate training consultantFive Tips from a Corporate Persuasion Expert. Uncross your arms. Uncross your legs. Okay. If you insist on crossing your legs, then cross them towards the person you want to persuade to do something.CommentsNorman SolomonAuthor, \u0027War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death\u0027On a plane circling Baghdad in gray dawn light, a little Iraqi girl quietly sang to herself in the next row. \"When I start to wonder why I\u0027m making this trip,\" Sean Penn murmured to me, \"I see that child and I remember what it\u0027s about.\"CommentsBianca BoskerExecutive Tech Editor, The Huffington PostBy and large, social media services have focused on providing us with the tools to spread our successes, make funny videos go viral and share OMG moments, while essentially ignoring the messy, depressing stuff that can\u0027t be \"heart\"-ed or given the thumbs-up.CommentsDr. Howard K. KohAssistant Secretary for Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human ServicesFor far too long, tobacco use has remained the leading preventable cause of death and disease in the United States. That\u0027s why the President has prioritized protecting Americans from tobacco\u0027s deadly health consequences.CommentsSamantha DanielsPresident of SamanthasTable.com; Author, \u0027Matchbook: The Diary of a Modern Day Matchmaker\u0027Have you ever wondered if there are guys out there that simply will not marry you? Are there certain men from whom you should just stay away because chances are, the relationship is going to be an exercise in frustration for you?Comments (956)Joseph A. PalermoAssociate professor, historian, authorTen years ago our \"leaders\" in the government, the corporate media, and the \"national security\" establishment assured us that invading Iraq was in our national interest.Comments (187)Mary Eileen WilliamsAuthor, \u0027Land the Job You Love: 10 Surefire Strategies for Jobseekers Over 50\u0027Just remember, as a mature job seeker, you\u0027ll want to take advantage of help from a wide variety of sources, select the methods and strategies that work best for you, and try to keep as optimistic as possible.Comments (28)Jeffrey Bland, Ph.DPresident, Personalized Lifestyle Medicine InstituteThere are now numerous medical studies indicating that a low glycemic index diet has a positive effect on not only improving insulin resistance, but also managing Type 2 diabetes, retinopathy, cardiovascular disease, and acne vulgaris.CommentsCraig KanalleySenior Editor, Big News \u0026 Live Events, The Huffington PostAccording to a patent filing that went public just weeks ago, listing co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg himself as one of the inventors, Facebook is considering something called \"Paid Profile Personalization.\"Comments (43)Chrysula WinegarBlogger, Million Moms Challenge Community ManagerA Q\u0026A with SPARK teen activists Julia Bluhm (15) and Izzy Labbe (14) who took on Seventeen magazine over photoshopping model\u0027s images and secured a commitment from the magazine to stop.CommentsRep. Bruce BraleyU.S. Representative for Iowa\u0027s 1st DistrictWe owe it to the countless veterans, families, and Americans who have been touched by our wars to be honest with each other about the true costs of war before we send our best and brightest off to war again.Comments (27)Una LaMarcheEditor of \u0027The Sassy Curmudgeon\u0027All of the organic, fair-trade, pasture-raised artisanal Play-Doh and 800-count recycled hemp crib sheets in the world won\u0027t matter if you as a parent don\u0027t feel at least reasonably happy and cared for.Comments (117)Ronald J. SiderPresident, Evangelicals for Social ActionIf we believe what the Bible says about God\u0027s concern for the poor; if we believe what the Bible says about justice; then we must denounce the gross inequality of opportunity and income in our country today as blatantly sinful.Comments (50)Nick TurseManaging Editor, TomDispatch.comThe Vietnam War killed more than 58,000 Americans. That\u0027s a lot of people and a lot of heartache. It deserves attention. But it killed several million Vietnamese and severely affected -- and I mean severely -- the lives of many millions more. That deserves a whole lot more focus.Comments (81)Rep.
