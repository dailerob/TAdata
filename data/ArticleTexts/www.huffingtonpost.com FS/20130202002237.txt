{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Christian leader for social changeLet me state some clear convictions from many of us in the faith community. The war in Vietnam was morally wrong. The war in Iraq was morally wrong. And John McCain has been morally wrong on both of them. Christian judgments of war should always run a narrow spectrum -- from the peacemaking ethic of Jesus, which rejects war to the just war theology of Augustine and Aquinas. But even in the just war tradition, conflicts have to pass a number of moral tests and be the option of \"last resort.\" The burden of proof is always on those who support war to justify the taking of life. After yesterday, I wished that the coming vote on confirmation could be the other way around; that America could somehow vote John McCain out of office and off the American political stage. The cost of McCain\u0027s theology of war has been far too high.Read Post | Comments (70)Michael Shermer, 02/01/13Founding publisher, Skeptic magazine; editor, Skeptic.comI am often asked what I mean by skepticism, and if I\u0027m skeptical of everything or if I actually believe anything.

Roger Denson, 02/01/13Cultural critic, essayist, novelist and screenwriter published with Parkett and Art in AmericaWhen considering torture and terror, the first question of relevance is, Do we require an experience of torture and terror first hand, either as a survivor or as a witness, to be credible on the subject?Read Post | CommentsMarian Wright Edelman, 02/01/13President, Children\u0027s Defense FundIf Americans had said no more after Columbine, there may never have been a Virginia Tech.
