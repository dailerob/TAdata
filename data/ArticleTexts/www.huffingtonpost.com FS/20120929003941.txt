{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Christian leader for social changeThe roots of anti-American hostilities in the Middle East run deep (literally and figuratively). We can start with the fact that our oil (and its economy) lies beneath their sands. Couple that with U.S. support of repressive and backward regimes, the continual presence of foreign troops on their land and in their holy places, and the endless wars waged there, ultimately fueled by the geopolitics of energy. Injustices and violence caused by the oil economy have sparked a reaction from dangerous religious fundamentalists in the Islamic world. This week, ugly anti-Islam ads implying that Muslims are uncivilized \"savages\" began appearing in New York City subways, prompting many people of good faith from across the nation to speak out against the ads. Sojourners now plans to bring a message of love -- a light in the darkness -- to counter the hate.Read Post | Comments (230)Howard Fineman, 09/28/12Editorial Director, Huffington Post Media GroupThis election is unlike any other in recent memory. Despite a lot of huffing and puffing, it is not about grand ideological conflict in America. It is more prosaic, but in its own way more urgent. It is about the viability of our democracy to make sensible economic decisions.Read Post | CommentsBill Nye, 09.27.2012The Science Guy, Partner to SOPHIA.orgWhen a student is excited about learning, amazing things happen. I\u0027ve had the joy of witnessing this firsthand with students of all ages -- seeing what happens when we, as adults and educators, give a student a nudge in a new direction.Read Post | Comments (17)Greta Van Susteren, 09/28/12Host of Fox News\u0027 \u0027On the Record with Greta Van Susteren\u0027Congressman Akin should skip the apologizing and instead have a frank talk with the voters in Missouri to explain exactly what he thought, exactly what he thinks now, and exactly how he arrived at his current thoughts about rape.Read Post | Comments (141)Bob Burnett, 09/28/12Berkeley writer, retired Silicon Valley executiveThirty-nine days before the Presidential election, Mitt Romney doesn\u0027t appear to be the formidable challenge to President Obama that many expected. Indeed, Romney\u0027s ineptness has turned the tide in Obama\u0027s favor. What happened?Read Post | Comments (930)Arianna Huffington, 09/28/12In this week\u0027s issue of Huffington, Lila Shapiro puts the spotlight on the small but robust gay contingent within the GOP, Tom Zeller Jr. tracks the debate over the eastward migration of mountain lions, and Gazelle Emami interviews Ai Weiwei, bringing the dissident Chinese artist\u0027s passion and fearlessness into sharp focus in time for his first major show in the U.S.Read Post | CommentsAllen Frances, 09/28/12Professor Emeritus, Duke UniversityI have an offer for David Brooks. If he promises to stop being an amateur psychologist, I promise to stop being an amateur columnist. What Brooks doesn\u0027t know about psychology is a lot. Everything he says about it has a shallow ring, is misinformed, and displays the same bias and ulterior motive.Read Post | Comments (97)Michael Vlahos, 09/28/12Writer and National Security expertWe were an outsider civilization that was going to calm and shape the Arab Middle East. Today our enterprise is in ruin. The Ottoman metaphor is relevant because we tried, however unconsciously, to be like them.Read Post | Comments (34)Gordon Brown, 09/28/12Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationEducation across the world must be a priority for us all -- an economic and of course a moral necessity. The challenge is not insurmountable; we know how to build schools and how to train teachers. And so the time for excuses is over, and action must begin today.Read Post | Comments (24)Pedro Almodóvar, 09/28/12Film director and producerIt sometimes happens that when you\u0027re hard at work making fiction, you get invaded by the feeling that what\u0027s important is happening elsewhere -- something much more powerful than the story that you have been creating, with care and obsession. That\u0027s what happened to me on Tuesday.Read Post | Comments (13)Madeleine Crum, 09/28/12Assistant Books editorI packed my bags for college having read every single one of Shakespeare\u0027s plays and Twain\u0027s novels, but not knowing who Jorge Luis Borges or Doris Lessing were.

Its increasingly agitated response to that development? Insist that the polls are hopelessly biased.Read Post | Comments (195)Richard (RJ) Eskow, 09/26/12Writer; host, \u0027The Breakdown\u0027; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureWhat appears to be a sudden epidemic of magical thinking actually reflects something else: the rise of a financial sector whose economic incentives have tilted away from core business competencies -- and toward something like that looks a little more like madness.Read Post | CommentsDaniel R. Schwarz, 09/28/12Stephen H. Weiss Presidential Fellow and Frederic J. Whiton Professor of English Literature at Cornell UniversityWe all want to be quoted accurately, but that is very different from allowing sources to delete substantive remarks.

But, the story goes, these Democrats have to have an \"alternative,\" and the \"alternative\" is drone strikes.Read Post | Comments (18)Marian Wright Edelman, 09/28/12President, Children\u0027s Defense FundCitizens must demand that every political leader state what they will do now to invest in and protect vulnerable children from hunger, homelessness and poor education. It\u0027s way past time to eliminate epidemic child poverty and the child suffering, stress, homelessness and miseducation it spawns.Read Post | CommentsMatthew Dowd, 09/28/12Political strategistIf Romney wants to win, this is the moment to focus on those three C\u0027s. Otherwise, he\u0027ll need to focus on another \"C\" on Nov. 6: concession.Read Post | CommentsRep. Mike Honda, 09/28/12U.S. Representative for California\u0027s 15th DistrictOne out of every 7 dollars spent in the U.S. is spent containing violence.

But based on the evidence, it would be unreasonable to conclude that the polls are giving us a qualitatively incorrect impression of how the election is shaping up.Read Post | Comments (47)John R.
