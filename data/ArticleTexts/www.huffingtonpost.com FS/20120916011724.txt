{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Executive Arts and Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post Media GroupIndependent film isn\u0027t what it used to be. Declining production costs and ever-proliferating distribution options have encouraged everyone from the U.S. Navy to fringe religious groups to dabble in filmmaking, with results that range from unsettling to explosive. The latest example -- The Innocence of Muslims, an incendiary piece of anti-Muslim bigotry that advertised its casting call in the pages of Backstage and shot scenes on a Paramount set -- has inflamed tensions across the Islamic world and inspired a series of violent outbreaks, including an assault on the U.S. embassy in Libya that killed Amb. Chris Stevens. Would a web posting have had the same effect? Or is there something about filmmaking that lends authority to an expression of stupidity that would otherwise be dismissed out of hand? The answer has something to do with the history of independent filmmaking, and the changes that have turned it upside down.Read Post | Comments (450)James Zogby, 09/15/12President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027If this week demonstrated anything, it is that we live in a dangerous and volatile world that requires a steady hand and thoughtful leadership to get us out of the mess we\u0027re in. We don\u0027t need more of the very same ideological clap-trap that got us into this mess in the first place.Read Post | Comments (180)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 09/15/12Author, research psychologist, and gender scholarBeing away from parents is a good thing. It gives kids room to grow and explore in new ways. We will still be the most influential people in our children\u0027s lives, but they don\u0027t have to be -- and shouldn\u0027t be -- our mirror image.Read Post | Comments (61)Neil Katz, 09/14/12Executive News Editor, Huffington Post Media GroupIf anyone but Apple released a major new product whose most unique selling point was a new accessory plug, consumers would jump ship faster than rats on the Titanic.

CIA covert operations officerWe have heard riveting stories of heroism and valor from one of the soldiers who participated in the mission that killed Osama bin Laden. His book is by most accounts devoid of any classified information. So are U.S. government officials angry that he wrote a book, or that his book came out before their movie?Read Post | Comments (1,091)Jared Bernstein, 09/15/12Senior Fellow, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesThe most direct way to create jobs, the only surefire way to be sure stimulus will work, is direct job creation. But we live in a dark age where any fiscal policy to create jobs is viewed as European socialism, despite the fact that Europe\u0027s even more austere than we are.Read Post | Comments (64)José Ramos-Horta, 09/14/12Former President, East Timor, 1996 Nobel Peace Prize laureateThe tragedy of Benghazi and riots in Yemen do not signal of the end of the Arab Spring. Nor is it an indication of any \"failed policies,\" any more than it is justification for the shameful practice of political candidates in the US attempting to make points from a US Ambassador\u0027s death.Read Post | Comments (269)Arianna Huffington, 09/14/12Where have the Occupiers been over the last year?
