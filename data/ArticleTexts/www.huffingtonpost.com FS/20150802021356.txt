{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Author/Professor, Miami University, Oxford, OhioCitizens United has created a new dynamic within the Republican Party. Call it the politics of plutocratic patrons, and at the moment it is causing the GOP to eat itself alive. With the caps lifted on spending, any candidate who can find a wealthy patron can make a perfectly credible run at the nomination. Marco Rubio found Norman Braman; Rick Santorum is being backed by multi-millionaire ultra-conservative Foster Friess. And all GOP hopefuls make pilgrimages to Sheldon Adelson and the Koch Brothers. The winners in this politics of plutocratic patrons are, naturally, candidates who would otherwise have no hope of being taken seriously but who have caught the fancy of some free-spending plutocrat.Our Utah trip tested the fears of at least one of us. Together, we marveled at the vast landscape, the untouched earth, and as a pair, we found a home in the great outdoors. I\u0027m sure it\u0027s a concept that resonates with many of us, but which is actually attained so rarely. It\u0027s what keeps us enjoying our beautiful country. But I still asked myself: Was it the place? Was it my daughter? Or was it me?Author, research psychologist and gender scholarThe American people should demand that the Senate act.

These nominees are eminently qualified and deserve better treatment from Senate Republicans.Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary CommitteeThe 2016 Republican presidential contest has barely begun and it has already grown alternately tiresome and old or just downright scary.

I just want it to end.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, one of the world\u0027s leading peace and justice advocates, has called Bryan Stevenson \"America\u0027s Nelson Mandela.\" He has gotten innocent men off death row, successfully argued before the U.S. Supreme Court multiple times, including to ban \"death sentences.\"President, Children\u0027s Defense FundDonald Trump is many things -- a demagogue and a pompous blowhard, a braggart and a race baiter--but in the end, he\u0027s nobody\u0027s fool, except perhaps his own. Thus, his recent lauding of Sarah Palin and his hiring of her former Chief of Staff reveal that Trump\u0027s campaign for the presidency is, ultimately, more of a circus act than it is a serious endeavor for the White House.Author and filmmakerOwn your pleasure. You\u0027re not a slut for wanting to come. You\u0027re not greedy for wanting to come as much as possible. You\u0027re a human. Human\u0027s seek pleasure.

Overlooking hedonic normalization leads us to exaggerate the joyfulness of the future and to overstate the joylessness of the past.Author, The Sceptical Optimist: Why Technology Isn\u0027t the Answer to EverythingFlorida legislators have lost their way on the issue of guns. There is a constitutional right (both state and federal) to own a gun. I get it! But the Second Amendment doesn\u0027t trump the First Amendment: The two are not even in conflict.Executive Director, ACLU of FloridaEven though it didn\u0027t live up to my very high expectations for all things yoga and 98 Degrees, at the end of the day I still get to say I did hot yoga with 98 Degrees. Hey, that\u0027s pretty cool.Healthy Living Writer, HuffPost TVIn order to successfully counter ISIS online recruitment, both the message and messenger should be of Sunni origin.

If you get sick at the idea of taking a loan out for your wedding, or feel that diamond rings are more marketing gimmick than romantic symbol, consider yourself a practical anti-Pinterest bride.Writer. Runner. Editor of StylebyFire.ca | Twitter: @theMirandaSamMany of the same voices urging Congress to kill the agreement belong to those who promised us that regime change in Iraq would unleash a wave of democracy across the region. They insisted that war was the only answer to Saddam Hussein. They were wrong -- deadly wrong -- about Iraq, yet they seem to have neither learned their lesson nor questioned their own instincts and impulses.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersMattress lifespan depends on many factors, but following these best practices can help ensure that you enjoy years of healthy sleep and that your investment lasts as long as possible.Writer, Content Manager at AmerisleepWhen we use atrocity to inspire us to act, to ask the right questions, to reach across the globe and try to stop someone from being killed or suffering, our world will become a more livable one.

Living in a world in which your blackness and woman-ness makes you less than human -- a hypersexual, angry or subservient caricature, the constant target of catcalling, rape and assault -- is exhausting.Black feminist writer and PhD candidateNext week on the date of the anniversary of the signing of the Act, Republican presidential primary contenders will be holding their first TV debate.
