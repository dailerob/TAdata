{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Director, Earth Institute at Columbia UniversityPresident Obama and the Republican Senators know what they are doing. They are handing gifts to the business lobbies out of sight of the American people, and attacking the opponents of fast track as anti-trade or ignorant, when in fact the opponents are merely pro-public interest. If the President and the Republicans believe these draft agreements are so good, and therefore merit fast track, let them make the agreements public, so that the public could say a resounding NO to ISDS and other threats to the common interest hidden within the draft agreements.Welcome news this week from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit. By a vote of 11 to 1, the court overturned its injunction against the controversial video called \"Innocence of Muslims\" that it had ordered off YouTube back in February 2014.Lecturer in Law at Stanford Law SchoolWhen the Wall Street bubble burst in 2008 because of excessive risk-taking, millions of working Americans lost their jobs, health insurance, savings, and homes. But The Street is back to many of its old tricks. And its lobbyists are busily rolling back the Dodd-Frank Act, intended to prevent another crash.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027According to United Nations statistics, noncombatants are dying in greater numbers every year, with the Taliban and other insurgents responsible for 72 percent of those deaths through suicide attacks and the use of IEDs and other indiscriminate weapons.Senior researcher on Afghanistan at Human Rights WatchThere are few policies that show the split between elite opinion and everyone else as clearly as trade policy. On trade we see a remarkable convergence of the leadership of both parties against their base, with the elites firmly behind the leadership against what they view as the ignorance of the masses.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027If you watched, you\u0027re surely pondering the meaning of Draper/Whitman\u0027s latest and greatest incarnation as New Age pitchman of killer soft drinks. But I\u0027ve also given a lot of thought to something else: What was Mad Men trying to tell us about America?Author, \u0027Tear Down This Myth\u0027When we talk about all of the problems we have on Earth and the need to solve them, it is only through such AI-human collaboration that we will gain the ability to solve our grandest challenges and truly create a world of abundance.Chairman/CEO, XPRIZEThe account of unsavory chicanery in high places once again spotlights the deceit that now is the hallmark of how our government works. Here are a few crucial points essential to assessment of Seymour Hersh\u0027s interpretation.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghAt the Cancer Prevention Summit on May 20th, 2015, experts in public health will challenge us all to consider what we could be doing better to prevent cancer. Most importantly, we need to commit to a collaborative effort, involving every segment of our society.Board-certified radiologist; Board member, Lesscancer; Author, \u0027A World Without Cancer\u0027Tonight I\u0027m joined by New York Times columnist David Brooks, author of The Road to Character. In the book he explores how some of history\u0027s most influential figures built their strong inner character and what essential values they possessed that should be emphasized in today\u0027s world. In this clip he explains why the virtues discussed in his book transcend political affiliation.PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorThey say timing is everything in life. Well, if that\u0027s true, the timing of this legislation to approve fast-track trade authority could not be worse for middle-class families.Senior Member of the Senate Foreign Relations CommitteeRemind me who, even among opponents and critics of the Bush administration\u0027s invasion of Iraq, ever imagined that the decision to take out Saddam Hussein\u0027s regime and occupy the country would lead to a terror caliphate in significant parts of Iraq and Syria that would conquer social media and spread like wildfire.Editor, TomDispatch.comWhile political bigwigs from both parties have publicly opposed big money in politics, they still plan on using heaps and heaps of it in the 2016 race. Unfortunately, their convictions on campaign reform are squeaking out from inside our currently screwed up political structure.Co-Founder, Ben \u0026 Jerry\u0027s Ice Cream and Head Stamper, StampStampede.orgThere is too much on the line for us to get caught up with minor differences. From racial disparity to income inequality, immigration reform, marriage equality, fair housing, job growth, pay equity, improved schools and much more, the challenges we face are real, and our commitment must be steadfast.President, National Action NetworkSometimes it\u0027s the not the things we need to start doing but the things we need to let go of doing that are holding us back from making progress and moving forward.Food Freedom Fighter, writer, speaker, wellness expert, founder of jennhand.com, and creator of Healing From Within.The issue in Iowa is not trade or no trade, as some apologists for Fast Track try to argue. The issue is what kind of ground rules do we want so that we can evaluate trade deals after 20 years of corporate trade agreements that mostly are meant to protect the investment profits of multinational corporations.President, Communications Workers of AmericaThe \"model minority\" label makes things worse for large sections of these communities, because their needs are often overlooked or misunderstood and then rarely addressed in government programs and by social-service organizations. Lack of disaggregated data perpetuates this label.Academic, Researcher, Writer, EntrepreneurIn a small \"secret room\" on the 25th floor of the Virgin Hotel in Chicago, rock icons Marilyn Manson and Billy Corgan sat before an audience of a few dozen fans and journalists on Monday. We learned a lot about the Chicago-area native, particularly a few of his pet peeves. Here are a few things Billy isn\u0027t into.Chicago Editor, The Huffington PostAfter causing a national fuss with \"Sorry, Babe, You\u0027re a Feminist\" and causing a scene with \"Boobs\" ...we\u0027re ready to chill. Need a little break too? Here are two sweet little things we\u0027d love to share with you:Award-winning comic, actress, author, creative coach, and social activistWe thought it worthwhile to give props to seven more gastronomically obsessed towns.Everything worth caring about in food, drink, and travelNEW YORK -- Ironically, in this era of exponential growth, we are witnessing the disappearance of cities. Our urbanism is becoming increasingly generic -- a Starbucks on every corner and an iPhone in every palm. We can do better.Distinguished Professor of Architecture, City College of New YorkWe are facing the decimation of entire small town economies, a disruption the likes of which we haven\u0027t seen since the construction of the interstate highway system itself bypassed entire towns. This time, it\u0027s different. This time, there\u0027s no need for entire towns to even exist at all.Writer and basic income advocateI didn’t expect Mad Men to tie everything up neatly — far from it, given what the show has been about for the past seven seasons. But let’s just say that some past season finales were more satisfying and resonant than the series finale was.TV critic, The Huffington PostEveryone who has an opinion on the Edward Snowden revelations should watch this film. Everyone who has an opinion on the USA PATRIOT Act should tune in. Disturbed by the National Security Agency\u0027s actions? Check your local listings for when the PBS show Independent Lens airs. I say all this, mind you, before I\u0027ve even seen the film.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comLadies\u0027 nights and last-minute dinner plans were easy to accommodate when neither of us had a significant other, but the second a man entered my life I\u0027d become flaky and unreliable, always canceling plans if it meant getting to see my boyfriend.Writer \u0026 blogger with equal passions for metaphysical matters and reality TV. Runs a blog for strong \u0026 sensitive women: scotchandthefox.comThis is not our parents\u0027 trade bill. It is not about providing fair trade -- which we all support. Fast track is about pushing through the TPP, TTIP and future trade agreements that would massively increase the power of big corporations and affect the daily lives of Americans. The impacts go beyond job loss -- as serious as that is.U.S. Representative for Illinois\u0027s 9th congressional districtMad Men has everything to do with Ferguson. It has relevance in congressional stalemates, with e-commerce. But perhaps the most perplexing result of the displacing plot techniques of Mad Men is the idea that the show isn\u0027t about men at all -- it\u0027s about American women.Freelance writer, content strategistUnder my proposal, the district attorneys are given the benefit of the doubt and are not superseded until a reason exists that suggests bias or wrongdoing. However, I would also reform the grand jury system to increase transparency by mandating that in such cases, there is public disclosure of the district attorneys instructions to the grand jury as to which charges they should consider.Governor of New YorkIt disturbs me that so many people have been hurt by a horrible lie about who Jesus is, and what his church is about. It is up to us to go out there and reclaim, and proclaim the authentic Gospel of love and liberationExecutive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostMeetings may be toxic, but calendars are the superfund sites that allow that toxicity to thrive. I\u0027ve yet to see a résumé -- and I hope I never do -- that lists \"attends meetings well\" as a skill. Yet attending meetings ends up being a key component of many jobs. And it\u0027s stupid.Co-founder, MuleCatchphrases were created and run into the ground for fun. I don\u0027t recall a single sentence of any foreign language I ever studied. But I do remember \"too much lotion!\" and \"they pelted us with rocks and garbage!\"Speechwriter and standup comedianGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"IT WAS A CRIME",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
