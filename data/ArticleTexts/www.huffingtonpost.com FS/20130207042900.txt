{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Worrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsState of the Union addresses at the start of a second presidential term are relatively rare phenomena, and in recent times they have also been also relatively ephemeral ones. George W. Bush used his SOTU Address in 2005 to make a prolonged pitch for the partial privatization of Social Security. That pitch went nowhere. Bill Clinton used his to launch a national crusade for education; but listening to him, among others, was Monica Lewinsky. Ronald Reagan spoke of \"lightening government\u0027s claims on our total economy\" by reducing the federal deficit; but his legacy didn\u0027t quite work out that way.
