{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week we went back to the future as President Obama authorized air strikes in Iraq, along with humanitarian airdrops of food and water to thousands of Yazidis besieged by Islamic State fighters. The White House emphasized the military action\u0027s limited scope. \"I will not allow the United States to be dragged into fighting another war in Iraq,\" said the President. But, of course, even though the U.S. formally withdrew our forces from Iraq in 2011, this is not another war; it\u0027s a continuation of the Iraq War, which should be renamed The War of Unintended Consequences. Though this week\u0027s air strikes, however warranted, should serve as a sobering rebuke to the kind of thinking that led us into Iraq in the first place, the same voices that headed that ill-conceived charge are still front and center -- like Paul Wolfowitz, who on Tuesday claimed that America had \"won\" the war in Iraq \"in 2009.\" I guess someone forgot to tell Iraq.The global hunger issue can seem overwhelming. The fact that more people will die from hunger this year than AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and war combined is unbelievable. I\u0027ve seen the emotional and physical toll hunger takes on the communities and families it impacts.Performer and volunteer spokesperson for World Hunger ReliefThe president was correct in announcing humanitarian action yesterday in Iraq. He will be helping to prevent genocide. But, more than that, his announcement of limited military action, both to overtly protect U.S. troops and installations, and tacitly support the Kurds in their fight against the Islamic State, is the correct move.Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranThere is no question that Africa faces many serious issues on the road to development. But a new reality is emerging. It is time for perceptions to change as well.UN Messenger of PeaceThe nuclear weapons era opened on August 6, 1945, the first day of the countdown to what may be the inglorious end of this strange species, which attained the intelligence to discover the effective means to destroy itself, but -- so the evidence suggests -- not the moral and intellectual capacity to control its worst instincts.Institute Professor emeritus, MIT Department of Linguistics and PhilosophyGaza is no stranger to bouts of violence and periods of intense instability, but I have never been there to experience it. Suburban America had sheltered me, but that was all over. My thoughts are still a whirlwind, but my feelings have never been more clear.Optometry student, University of Houston College of Optometry; co-founder, Dunia HealthDuring this time of commemoration of man\u0027s inhumanity, visited upon the people of Japan three generations ago, let us resolve that we shall demand leaders who will resist the impulse to solve political and security problems through weapons of mass destruction.Former 16-year member of the U.S. Congress and two-time U.S. presidential candidateThis crisis needs a compassionate response from every city and our entire nation. I shudder when I see the angry outbursts about these helpless children coming from some communities.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundThis conflict has, perhaps in ways that are not immediately evident, changed the strategic environment for both Israel and the Palestinians. The questions of whether they are aware of this and how they will adapt will be central for the futures of both people.lincolnmitchell.comAbandon the cultural myth that all female friendships must be bitchy, toxic, or competitive. This myth is like heels and purses -- pretty but designed to SLOW women down.Author, An Untamed State and AyitiOne of the most persistent lies told in Washington is the notion that common carriage is a heavy-handed regulation that transforms innovative businesses into antiquated, government-run utilities.Senior Director of Strategy, Free PressWe have heard again and again that we are losing \"the global competition\" to nations like South Korea where students and parents take tests very seriously. But are test scores worth it?Research Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027The betrayal of intellectuals has been especially noticeable during the days of the operation in Gaza. I don\u0027t accuse intellectuals of bias or of anti-Semitism but too many of them are certainly guilty of intellectual laziness.Israel\u0027s Minister of Finance and the head of Yesh Atid, Israel\u0027s second largest political partyIn retrospect, shareholder capitalism wasn\u0027t all it was cracked up to be. Look at the flat or declining wages of most Americans, their growing economic insecurity, and the abandoned communities that litter the nation.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Most researchers believe there are three primary motivating factors behind dating someone at work -- love, ego and job. Men do it for love. Women do it to get ahead. That\u0027s the outrageously biased way people judge office romances -- and another example of women getting a bum deal.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarWhether it\u0027s James Brown or Eric Garner, police shouldn\u0027t be trained or allowed to go above the law in the name of enforcing the law.President, National Action NetworkThe corporate under-written Common Core standards and tests are at best a distraction and at worse add grievous insult to injury for children of color.Co-Founder, Network for Public EducationAssistant Professor and Deputy Chair in the Department of Puerto Rican \u0026 Latin@ Studies at Brooklyn College (City University of New York)On issue after issue facing our country, this is a Republican Party so obsessed with blocking the president -- and now suing the president -- that it has abdicated its most basic responsibility to govern.U.S. Senator from CaliforniaThe simplistic narratives spinning around the war about Gaza only make things worse for its victimized citizenry. For Israelis and for those truly interested in a positive future for Gaza, it is essential to understand that Hamas and the Palestinians who live there are not one and the same.Fmr. U.S. Ambassador to Morocco \u0026 White House Middle East Adviser/CEO of Peaceworks LLC \u0026 The OneVoice Movement FoundationYou need to say thank you. It can be a tiring place, this happily ever after. Yes, there is love and there are kitchen dances and sweet cream baby cheeks. But there are also sleepless nights and mortgages and post baby stretch marks.WriterMany in the financial industry couldn\u0027t care less about unemployment. They don\u0027t want to risk any inflation that could erode the value of their wealth. Their voices are being heard at the top levels of the Fed. It is essential that the broader public get involved in this debate as well.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Magician and New York Times crossword puzzle wizard David Kwong says we\u0027re wired to solve puzzles and make order out of chaos -- and he\u0027s got a trick to prove it.\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"You will never stop worrying, or doubting yourself, but you will have more proof that you are doing it right. Each day that passes is another day that you get to take credit for.Mother, Wife, Blogger, mamabythebay.comI disagree with those who suggest that Netanyahu will never change his stripes. Many deeply ideological leaders before him have unexpectedly risen to the occasion to answer the call from their people and the international community for a drastic change.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUI have been actively monitoring my daily life and watching the ways in which that privilege has benefited me when it comes to the blogging and writing that I do. So here it is, 10 ways in 10 days.Poet, author, and activistDefeatism infects the Democratic Party\u0027s bloodstream. This affliction is systemic and chronic. It has spread through every limb and organ of the party from the White House to towns across America.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghAs an autism parent, it offends me that my children\u0027s condition is being used to scare people away from life-saving medical treatments.Freelance writer and mother to three childrenIt has been widely reported that August 9 marks the 40th anniversary of President Nixon\u0027s resignation. What has received considerably less attention is that the date also marks the 30th anniversary of the publication of what may well be the stupidest thing ever written about Watergate: an op-ed column for The Washington Post by one Benjamin J. Stein.The 25th anniversary edition of Paul Slansky\u0027s The Clothes Have No Emperor will be published this fall.Please, for the love of all that\u0027s good and holy, stop the nonsense. We\u0027ve overcome this problem before and we can do it again. Remember saying things were \"radical\" or \"rad\"?Blogger, \"Hot Flashes of Inspiration\"I did my best to get away from work last week while my family and I were on vacation visiting friends who live in Kalispell, the gateway to Montana\u0027s Glacier National Park. But it wasn\u0027t quite possible. You see, I\u0027m a climate scientist. And the spectre of climate change stares you in the face as you tour the park.Director of Penn State Earth System Science Center; Author of \u0027Dire Predictions\u0027 and \u0027The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars\u0027We have drifted very far from our understanding of the relationship that is supposed to exist between We the People, our government, and the businesses that our government allow to exist.Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"MALIKI DEFIANT COUP FEARS",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
