The list of knowable knowns that we still don\u0027t know about includes the final destination of the taxpayer money the government keeps funneling to AIG. AIG\u0027s CEO prefers not to say who has our money. Same with the Fed. Same with Bank of America\u0027s CEO who prefers to go to court instead of saying who got bonuses. It\u0027s time to call in all the knowable unknowns.Read Post | CommentsBIOCarlos Watson, 03.09.2009What Rush reminded us of in the last few weeks is what will keep most of us down: negativity and mindless carping.
