It makes absolutely no sense.READ POST | comments (87)12.17.2005 Robert GreenwaldWhen Senator Russ Feingold announced that he was going to refuse to support the Patriot Act, even if it meant a filibuster, he was a lonely voice in the wilderness.READ POST | comments (25)12.17.2005 Ian UrbinaCriticizing something for being passive-aggressive is like faulting a tactic for being discreet. Just as there are times when subtlety is the worst approach, there are also times when passive aggression is the best.READ POST | comments12.17.2005 Bill MaherWhen I see Hillary Clinton getting on the bandwagon with flag burning, I think she really is the worst of both worlds.READ POST | comments (136)12.16.2005 Nora EphronSome choice words from Harold Pinter, and some others from President George W.
