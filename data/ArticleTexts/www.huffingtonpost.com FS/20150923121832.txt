{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"There comes a moment in the political life of every big-personality, more-sizzle-than-steak candidate when they step across the line of legitimacy, even for media addicted to the high ratings these candidate-entertainers provide. That moment for Sarah Palin was her Katie Couric interview in 2008 -- the hockey-mom-has-no-clothes revealing from which she, and the McCain campaign, never recovered. In Donald Trump\u0027s candidacy, the equivalent moment might have just happened, at a town hall event in New Hampshire. Cracks are appearing in Trump\u0027s latest Trump-branded edifice -- because this one never actually had a foundation. As Palin demonstrated, even the ratings-crazed media are capable of falling out of love with a big-ratings stunt candidate. And when the media fall out of love they fall out of love very quickly.No one should be allowed to profit from putting more people behind bars -- whether they\u0027re inmates in jail or immigrants held in detention centers. In fact, I believe that private prisons shouldn\u0027t be allowed to exist at all, which is why I\u0027ve introduced legislation to eliminate them.Democratic candidate for President, US Senator from VermontAs a Republican, I am utterly ashamed of my party. As a soldier for 31 years, I am disgusted with these \"courageous\" candidates, none of whom has served a day in the Infantry in their lives. As a citizen, I am deeply concerned for my country.Colonel, U.S. Army (Retired)In accordance with its legal and moral duty, the United States should step up to the plate and welcome significant numbers of refugees.Professor, Thomas Jefferson School of LawThe Chinese must understand that America would like to see a peaceful, prosperous, and free China and that we do not wish to undermine the rise of China. Similarly, Americans need to understand that China differs from the Soviet Union that we faced in the Cold War.39th President of the United StatesIf intellectual arguments cannot defeat the militaristic foreign policy paradigm (the one that justified preemptive wars and produced the Iraq fiasco), then perhaps religious appeals can. That\u0027s were Pope Francis comes in.President, National Iranian American CouncilI\u0027ve been hearing from a lot of women who are proud of Hillary Clinton\u0027s lifelong commitment to preventing violence against women. Lately, they\u0027ve been telling me they like what they\u0027ve seen and heard about her vision for preventing the alarming reality of sexual assault on college campuses.President, National Organization for WomenThis affair has not only caused Germany\u0027s greatest industry to falter -- it has also tarnished the image of our economy. Reliability, credibility -- once the core attributes of our automotive industry -- seem implausible in the backdrop of this scandal.Editor in Chief, HuffPost GermanyDocuments released last month in the settlement of a lawsuit at the University of Kansas offer a revealing window into an underreported Koch brothers\u0027 strategy: targeted, politicized funding on college campuses.Editorial Director, Union of Concerned ScientistsWe are the rhinos\u0027 bodyguards. We are the Black Mambas. And we refuse to let them become extinct on our piece of earth.Ranger with the Black Mamba Anti-Poaching UnitThat Dr. Ben Carson, a black man who is running for President, has said a Muslim should not be President of the United States just killed the American dream for many children and their parents in this country and the illusion that America stands for something greater -- equality and dignity for all.Author of Living With IntentWhile Republican presidential candidates and members of Congress voiced their support for defunding Planned Parenthood, nearly 2,700 structures were destroyed by two unpredictable California wildfires, California\u0027s four year drought reached epic proportions, and the summer of 2015 became the warmest summer ever recorded on planet Earth.Educator, Businessman, Freelance ColumnistGrowing up in Arizona, it was hard for me to relate to the term \"Hispanic\" where I often heard the word being used in a demeaning way. People are so much more complex than their racial or ethnic identities, and we will always encounter issues when using terms that are supposed to neatly fit humans into groups.Team USA fencer, Olympic hopefulThe Western world is slipping back into the demoralization and loss of faith in its own values that overwhelmed Europe in the 1930s and opened the way to catastrophe. Trump\u0027s success is a symptom of something very dangerous that will long outlive his present campaign.Co-author, \u0027The Shape of the New: Four Big Ideas and How They Made the Modern World\u0027Co-author, \u0027The Shape of the New: Four Big Ideas and How They Made the Modern World\u0027Though it seems downright impossible, nothing would be cooler than for our country\u0027s top leader -- our moral and political compass -- to tweet out with full frankness and honesty, \"Hey, we\u0027ve got a serious problem with racism and policing when it comes to young Black and Brown children in America.\"Staff Attorney, Advancement Project\u0027s Ending the Schoolhouse to Jailhouse Track CampaignNuclear weapons have been in the headlines for years and yet all attention in this period has been focused on Iran. Almost never in the news, on the other hand, are the perfectly real arsenals that could actually wreak havoc on the planet, especially our own.Professor of Molecular Biology at MIT, Chair of the Nuclear Abolition Committee of Massachusetts Peace ActionHousing and Business Contract Analyst, Boston\u0027s Department of Neighborhood DevelopmentIt is a political and cultural challenge: after 50 years we Western Europeans have finally managed to live together, despite the difficulties. We are still only halfway there, and there is a long way to go. And now it\u0027s Islam\u0027s turn.Italy\u0027s Under-Secretary for Foreign AffairsTo understand just how far Trump and Carson have veered into the territory of bigotry and racism, imagine if we were to substitute the word \"Jew\" for \"Muslim.\" What if Trump\u0027s fan said to him: \"We have a problem in this country. It\u0027s called Jews...When can we get rid of them?\"Author, \"The Fear of Islam: An Introduction to Islamophobia in the West\"If I had a big huge red pen and could permanently strike five words from the Standard Veterinary Dialogue, it would be this: \"You\u0027ll know when it\u0027s time.\"author, veterinarian, and death fairyWe claim we want to be treated equally as gay people, but then, in 2015, with much more acceptance in the culture, we still ask for special treatment of gay and bisexual public figures while every aspect of the sex lives of heterosexual public figures is dissected every day. We can\u0027t have it both ways any longer.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostTrump doesn\u0027t have the patience, temperament, self-discipline or interest in policy issues that it takes to be president. And, deep inside, he knows it better than anyone. Fortunately for America, he can\u0027t win the presidency, because his appeal is much too narrow.E.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeIt would be easy to characterize Ahmed Mohamed\u0027s arrest as a \"bizarre aberration.\" One could imagine chalking it up to \"crazy Texas,\" or worse, victim blaming. We should avoid such decontexualizations that disregard the importance of Ahmed\u0027s arrest. It didn\u0027t happen in a vacuum.Attorney. Writer. Activist.Alexis Tsipras is now alone, without the power of magic, he must prove that, apart from a risk-taking gambler and charismatic claimant of elections, he can also be an effective manager of a government that has 10 months to perform a miracle.Editor-At-Large, HuffPost GreeceYou don\u0027t have to agree with all of the Catholic Church\u0027s doctrines to recognize that the Pope\u0027s message has a timeliness and urgency.WriterAs a highly educated person, as a candidate for the presidency, and as someone who has co-authored, along with your wife Candy, a book titled A More Perfect Union: What We the People Can Do to Reclaim Our Constitutional Liberties, you should have a more enlightened understanding of our nation\u0027s foundational document.College of Education, University of Massachusetts AmherstIt is never easy to change your habits or your children\u0027s habits, but it does not get easier as they get older -- so now is the time to start!Certified Nutritional Therapy PractitionerPrime Minister Narendra Modi\u0027s visit to the United States this week will continue the growing positive and proactive engagement between these \"natural allies,\" a label first raised by President Barack Obama in 2009.Senior Fellow, Center for American ProgressI can say very honestly that I never experienced any anger toward God. Jesus Christ has always remained a faithful friend to me. If I could no longer serve my local parish, at least I had gone down trying to live my faith.Catholic, gay man, activist, writerIt\u0027s no wonder Mark Zuckerberg is rolling out the red carpet for the Indian head of state. An intriguing question is what Modi hopes to get out of the visit, and a one-word answer comes to mind: talent. Modi, and India more broadly, should invite some of the country\u0027s impressive diaspora to go home.Professor of Finance at UCLA Anderson School \u0026 co-founder FinancialAccessatBirth.orgMaybe it\u0027s just me, but these new online communication tools seem entirely unnecessary. After all, trolls, bullies, and haters have being doing just fine with their words.Co-founder, CyberWise.org: No Grownup Left Behind! and Founder, CyberCivics.comOne story that has everyone outraged is that of Turing Pharmaceuticals, run by Martin Shkreli. He took the price of the 62-year-old drug Daraprim, used to treat toxoplasmosis in HIV patients, and raised it to $750 a tablet.
