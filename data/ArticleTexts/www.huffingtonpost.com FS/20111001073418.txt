{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Author, \u0027Framing The Debate\u0027 and \u0027Outright Barbarous\u0027Watching the GOP rock-show pyrotechnics shoot up at the prospect of Chris Christie running for president, keen observers may have noticed a remarkable transformation taking place in American politics. Republicans have injected so much ginned-up lab-tested indignation into their campaigns that their nomination contest looks more like a professional wrestling road show than a civic debate about America\u0027s future. It would all be fun and games except for one tiny, albeit significant fact: this approach threatens to derail America\u0027s economic future. This country needs a real debate about the economy based on facts, not an arena spectacle.Read Post | Comments (95)Van Jones, 9/30/11President of RebuildtheDream.com and author of NY Times bestseller, \"The Green-Collar Economy\"Wall Street has long been the home of the biggest threat to American Democracy.

It\u0027s a matter of morality. Republicans have posed the deepest moral question of any society: whether we\u0027re all in it together. Their answer is we\u0027re not.Read Post | Comments (1,241)Roya Boroumand, 9/30/11Executive director, Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation.What determines political developments in a closed country does not necessarily happen in front of the cameras with tanks rolling over protesters.
