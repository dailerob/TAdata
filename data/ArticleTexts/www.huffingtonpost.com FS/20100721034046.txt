{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Some of my happiest moments -- as well as my most enriching and enlightening moments -- have come through travel: my first trip out of Athens when I was 11 (to Paris); my first trip to America when I was 16; traveling around India at 17, riding third class but getting a first-class education. It\u0027s why I\u0027m delighted to announce the launch of HuffPost Travel, which will be both practical (hot deals, travel tips, hotel reviews) and inspiring -- a reminder that travel can be a great way to unplug and recharge, and also to learn and grow. As Steinbeck wrote: \"People don\u0027t take trips; trips take people.\" So check out HuffPost Travel and let us know what you think. Bon Voyage!Read Post | CommentsJason Linkins, 07.20.2010As things sit, the White House is hesitating, looking for all the world like it is going to veer away from tapping Warren for the sort of job she was born to do. In so doing, Obama is picking some weak allies over some great enemies.Read Post | CommentsDylan Ratigan, 07.20.2010\"The Dylan Ratigan Show\" on MSNBC 4:00PM ETBankster Politicians, when faced with giving support to many of the same people tossed from employment by their cronyism, have all of a sudden found ideology.Read Post | CommentsKate Auletta, 07.20.2010Travel Editor, Huffington PostHere at Huffington Post Travel, we\u0027re fully committed to the idea that travel, no matter how close or far you go, is in everyone\u0027s DNA.Read Post | CommentsLeo Hindery, Jr., 07.20.2010Chairman, U.S. Economy/Smart Globalization Initiative at the New America FoundationThe Great Recession of 2007 is so \"Great\" that this time it\u0027s going to take certainty of the sort that only large-scale Keynesian-type government intervention in sustained job creation can generate.Read Post | CommentsRep.

But carrying on in a war not worth fighting would be worse. The Obama administration should focus on protecting Americans from terrorism. It should leave nation-building in Afghanistan to the Afghan people.Read Post | CommentsChris Gray Faust, 07.20.2010Editor, Chris Around The World; Former travel editor of USA TODAYBefore Meyer\u0027s first book came out in 2005, visitor levels ranged from 5,000 to 10,000 people per year, according to the Forks Chamber of Commerce.

John Sarbanes, 07.20.2010American surprise at Turkey\u0027s increasing petulance on the world stage reflects just how naive the U.S. has been. Turkey\u0027s unreliability as a NATO ally is well understood by those who have suffered Turkish aggression.Read Post | CommentsRichard (RJ) Eskow, 07.19.2010Consultant, Writer, Policy AnalystA disturbing pattern seems to be forming in Washington: Evidence of financial wrongdoing leads to settlements with large banking institutions, but with no apparent move to indict the individuals responsible.Read Post | CommentsDean Baker, 07.19.2010Co-Director of the Center for Economic and Policy ResearchThe reason for singling out the Republicans in the Senate, among all the people whose incompetence contributed to the economic crisis, is that they have decided to obstruct the extension of unemployment benefits.Read Post | CommentsRobert Greenwald, 07.19.2010Filmmaker, Brave New FilmsImagine how you would feel going to work every day and exposing yourself regularly to toxic chemicals that were eroding your health.
