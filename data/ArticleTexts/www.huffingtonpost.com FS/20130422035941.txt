{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe United States Senate\u0027s failure to pass common sense gun safety measures -- the Manchin-Toomey Amendment to expand background checks to keep guns away from underage or dangerous people, and amendments to ban assault weapons and high capacity magazines designed only to kill as many human beings as possible -- is a moral failure of great magnitude. Once again the safety of children has been sacrificed by political leaders in service to the gun lobby. As Americans do we value guns more than the lives of children? Do we really want to continue to have political leaders who kowtow to the threats and money and half-truths of the gun lobby and who think their political jobs are more important than the right of children to live and learn and grow up in safety?Comments (241)John PavleyCTO @ The Huffington Post, BloggerThis week, starting with the tragic and sensless bombing of the Boston Marathon on Monday, through a riveting manhunt for two fugitive brothers, and ending in the death of one and apprehension of the other, Social Brother showed us just how powerful his genie (Internet mobile social photography) has become.CommentsSimi Singh JunejaMother, writerHe could be my son: the oval face; the close-set dark eyes; the curly black hair; tall and lanky. My son was born in 1993, same as the Boston Bomber suspect. As a mother of a swarthy young man, I\u0027m always vigilant about the similarities in appearance of a terrorism suspect.Comments (12)Jonathan R. WhiteLaw enforcement and military consultantIt\u0027s time for the media and news consumers to step away from drama. Americans need to understand the nature of modern terrorism.CommentsMichael HoganExecutive Arts and Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post Media GroupGandhi said, \"An eye for an eye will only make the whole world blind.\" But Muhammad Ali spoke for \"Game of Thrones\" when he said, \"You kill my dog, you better hide your cat.\" Yes, revenge is the theme of this week\u0027s episode. Everybody wants some.CommentsAlberto IbarguenPresident, John S. and James L.

Here\u0027s a look back at 50 tweets, including 15 pictures, and five YouTube videos (one for each day) that tell the story of the Boston Marathon bombing, from beginning to end.CommentsJosh SilverDirector, Represent.UsEven the most cynical amongst us were stunned when the U.S. Senate voted down a watered down, bipartisan, partial background check for gun purchases that\u0027s supported by some 90 percent of Americans and 74 percent of NRA members.Comments (490)HuffPost RadioReagan and Clarke share their reactions in personally terrorizing situations -- Ron after his father was shot, Torie at the Pentagon on 9/11 -- and how public officials should respond to violence. Good: \"stay calm and carry on\" like Deval. Bad: overreact w/ Iraq \u0026 torture. Ugly: vote for gun deaths.CommentsLeigh SteinbergSports agentThe most anxiety-fueled, suspenseful, nerve-wracking, emotional and ultimately explosively joyful day of the year is coming this week for anyone who represents prospects in this year\u0027s NFL Draft.CommentsJohn SeagerPresident, Population ConnectionSlowing down population growth won\u0027t single-handedly solve the problems of hunger, water scarcity and biodiversity loss -- but it would help reduce the pressures on natural resources.CommentsBrian Glyn WilliamsProfessor of Islamic Studies at Univ of Mass. DartmouthWhile there are no links between Chechen insurgents/jihadists/terrorists and Al Qaeda, there is a long and bloody record of Chechen terrorism against a dominant state that may have inspired the two Chechen American brothers to carry out their senseless act of terrorism against a country that gave them refuge from their own war torn homeland.Comments (79)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; host, \u0027The Breakdown\u0027; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureCorporate interests and their elected representatives have created a world of illusion in order to resist paying a decent wage to working Americans. They\u0027d have us believe that minimum-wage workers are teens from \u002750s TV sitcoms working down at the local malt shoppe.Comments (82)Michael WolkowitzCo-Founder Faiths United to Prevent Gun Violence; Former Chair, The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun ViolenceAs we focus spotlights on the people who voted the wrong way, let\u0027s also focus on the people who could turn them around.CommentsJamie CourtAuthor, \u0027The Progressive\u0027s Guide to Raising Hell\u0027; President, Consumer WatchdogThe New York Times report today that the Koch brothers have moved closer to purchasing the Los Angeles Times sent shivers through Angelenos like me who cling to Thomas Jefferson\u0027s admonition about the importance of the freedom of the press.Comments (18)Vivian Diller, Ph.D.Psychologist and author, \u0027Face It\u0027Whether it\u0027s Kim, Kate, or Drew, why not admire them for their courage to bear children under scrutiny and do it so beautifully? When it comes to the rest of us, remember that there is no such thing as a \u0027one size fits all\u0027 path toward motherhood.CommentsLorenzo VidinoSenior fellow, Center for Security Studies, ETH Zurich, SwitzerlandOver the next few days we will learn more about Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, from their childhood in Central Asia and their arrival to America up to the last days before and after their alleged attack against the Boston Marathon.Comments (128)Jamie El-Erian and Mohamed A. El-ErianThey say that adversity is the true test of character. Well, what happened last week was much, much more than an adversity. Yet it demonstrated that the people of Boston and its surroundings sure know how to step up when called upon; and they did so with enormous courage and dignity.CommentsHeidi Grant Halvorson, Ph.D.Motivational psychologist and author, \"Succeed,\" \"Nine Things Successful People Do Differently\" and \"Focus\"Do opposites attract, as Paula Abdul once assured us in a pop song, or do you need to be similar on 19 dimensions of personality -- as eHarmony suggests -- to find the perfect match?CommentsJoseph Young and Melissa Scholes YoungAssistant professor and writing instructor, American UniversityWe don\u0027t want the Boston Marathon bombers to be us. We don\u0027t claim them. They can\u0027t be Americans. As soon as suspects were identified, we rejected these young men. Even some of their family did. We blame them because of our fear.Comments (199)Glennon MeltonBlogger, MomasterySafe means that you are being your best self and living the life you\u0027ve imagined even in the face of uncertainty.

Thank you for helping us when we were down. Thank you for saving my great-grandfather. Thank you for my life. I\u0027ve never met you, but I love you.CommentsCarla BuzasiCarla Buzasi is editor-in-chief of The Huffington Post UKPeople run for all kinds of reasons: to raise money for good causes, to get fit and healthy, to get away from the rest of the world, and sometimes just to prove to themselves they can.CommentsJonathan AppelAssociate Professor of Psychology and Criminal Justice, Tiffin UniversityIn telling our secrets to others (even anonymously), we are holding up a mirror to see the simple but profound truth of what \"is.\" Is this perhaps the secret to life?CommentsErwin de LeonPolicy researcher and writerThe president and the senators are, for the most part, in sync.
