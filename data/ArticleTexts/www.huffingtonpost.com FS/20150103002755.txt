{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Worrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsThe first hours of a new year are always an ideal time for people across the globe to reflect on their contemporary condition. And it is particularly vital that we in America take this moment of reflection as this new year begins, given the enormity of the impact of our condition on the rest of the global order. America may be the world\u0027s dominant super-power, and according to its own lights uniquely benign in that role, but the world it seeks to dominate is proving remarkably resistant to that supposedly benign dominance. So perhaps now is a good time to ask why? What is it about our contemporary political role that makes so much of what we attempt to do abroad ultimately self-defeating?For those who follow politics like episodes of Game of Thrones, get ready for a blockbuster season when the new Congress begins this week. Cast with committee chairs who rule with the congressional equivalent of the scepter: a gavel.Congressman from New York\u0027s 3rd Congressional District; Author of the forthcoming book \u0027The Global War On Morris\u0027One New Year\u0027s resolution I\u0027ve kept? Two years ago, I was with my childhood girlfriends for New Year\u0027s Eve and said I wanted to keep a journal of the milestones in my children\u0027s lives. One of them suggested that I share some of it with them every month. They held me accountable, cheering me on when I sent entries and reminding me when I fell behind. A year later, I was still going strong.Chief Operating Officer, FacebookSome months back, Senate Republicans blocked -- for the third time -- the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill proposing to close the pay gap between men and women. The goal of the bill -- the attainment of equal pay for equal work -- seems like a no-brainer, right? Yet not a single Republican voted in favor of the Act.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarWe\u0027ve made progress this year -- raising the minimum wage in dozens of states and cities, providing equal marriage rights in a majority of states, limiting carbon emissions.

Poker is the prime game of politics and politicians. The President\u0027s record suggests that he is something less than its master. There is only one group of players whom he beats regularly -- the \"liberals\" whose gambling instincts have been honed in endless games of rainy-day Scrabble.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghRather than feeling deflated and defeated by the passing of any stage in life, we might better direct our energy to the challenges before us.

Let\u0027s make 2015 a banner year.Executive Director, Latin America Working GroupJust in case you\u0027re short of resolutions to make this year, let me add one more to the chorus.

Along with these we also saw considerable gains, for example, in terms of college enrollment numbers, the number of Latino Congress members, as well as a little light at the end of the tunnel for U.S.-Cuba diplomatic relations.Principal and CEO, Speak Hispanic and Founder, Border Kids Relief ProjectCan a radical immersion in nature heal our deep emotional wounds?

She\u0027s going back to help people in that long-oppressed country achieve their dreams.Former speechwriter at the U.S. Department of StateMost of us would love to be morning people. We\u0027ve heard about the benefits of waking up early time and time again. But it\u0027s easier said than done, and good intentions alone don\u0027t go very far.

Say hi! :)In a world rife with war, religious, racial, gender, sectarian, and political strife, when so many children lack safety, enough food, shelter, health care, and education and suffer unthinkable losses of parents to disease, violence, and war, I hope this New Year will bring adults closer to our common sense and moral responsibility for children\u0027s well being.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe Keystone XL tar sands pipeline is not a jobs program. It is not an economic development program. It brings risk to our farmers in the heartland and the health of communities across the country threatened by climate change. It is time to reject the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline once and for all.Director of Programs, Natural Resources Defense CouncilThe most ridiculous comments seem to come from Republicans and I would defy anyone to say otherwise.
