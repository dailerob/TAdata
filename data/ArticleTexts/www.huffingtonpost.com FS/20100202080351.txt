Beck\u0027s key point of contention was over my assertion that he had warned people that they were in danger of being \"slaughtered\" by the Obama administration and its friends. \"I don\u0027t know that I\u0027ve ever used the word \u0027slaughtered,\u0027\" he insisted. Unfortunately for Beck -- but fortunately for fans of facts, reality, and the truth -- we live in the era of DVRs, YouTube, and embeddable video. And what Beck actually said is recorded for posterity.Davos Diary 2010: Snapshots from My Short But Sweet VisitRead Post | Comments (183)BIOJames Kwak, 02.01.2010Co-founder of The Baseline Scenario and co-author of 13 BankersWith an opposition party ready to roll out its artillery at any mention of either Medicare cuts or tax increases, it\u0027s hard to see where a budget solution can come from.Read Post | Comments (1188)BIOPeter Diamandis, 02.01.2010Chairman \u0026 CEO, X PRIZE FoundationThe President\u0027s plan for commercial competition for space exploration will ultimately take us much farther and much faster, not only to the Moon, but to Mars, the asteroids and beyond.Read Post | Comments (66)BIOChris Kelly, 02.01.2010Writer, Real Time with Bill MaherIf O\u0027Keefe wasn\u0027t planting a bug, what was the Dork Knight\u0027s plan?
