{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonSince launching our Third Metric campaign -- to redefine success beyond money and power to include well-being, wisdom, our ability to wonder and to give back -- I\u0027ve been seeing things through a Third Metric lens. And what I see is a split-screen world. On one side, we have endless examples of how the business world still hasn\u0027t changed and continues to glorify an approach to measuring success that leads to burnout. On the other side of the screen, there are more and more examples from companies large and small of prioritizing well-being. One of the primary things keeping many businesses from adopting more sustainable metrics of success is the stubborn -- and dangerously wrongheaded -- myth that prioritizing health and well-being is incompatible with a healthy bottom line; and that there is a trade-off between high performance and taking care of ourselves. As countless studies show, this couldn\u0027t be less true.Comments (339)Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOThe real question today for long-term investors has less to do with the quasi-inevitably of short-term volatility that comes from expectation of monetary policy shifts in the U.S., and more with whether these short-term bad technicals will contaminate longer-term economic fundamentals.CommentsLisa BelkinSenior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, The Huffington PostShe talked to him the way you talk to a child. She talked to him the way you talk to YOUR child. She saw him as a human being, not a monster, and she tried to help him.Comments (71)Bill SimonPresident, Chief Executive Officer, WalmartHow can we seize this opportunity to revive U.S. manufacturing and begin rebuilding the middle class?Comments (453)Brittany GibbonsBlogger, \"Brittany, Herself\"The fact is, I am horrible at intimacy. I come from a family of non-huggers and I sometimes hate my body, so yeah, recipe for Temple Grandin hug machine. My husband is gorgeous and very, very sexy, but the issues we were having in the sack were all me.Comments (491)Diane RavitchHistorian, NYU professorCharles Blow is one of the columnists in the New York Times that I usually count on to challenge the conventional wisdom and to speak up for the powerless. Sadly, in his latest column, he parrots the conventional wisdom and voices the opinions of the elites.Comments (146)Matt WalshBlogger, talk radio host, father of twinsSome folks seem to get into a customer service Battle Royale every time they step outside their house. Maybe it\u0027s because the universe is against you guys. Or maybe -- just maybe -- it\u0027s because you behave like selfish obnoxious bullies.Comments (23)Adam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; founder of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911While it\u0027s true that getting a good price is a big part of the hunt, the biggest, most important, super-secret strategy to turn the stealth hunter (them) into the prey: stand tough and fight to maximize your dollar throughout the process.Comments (108)Robert CreamerPolitical Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersFor everyday Americans to once again be able to look forward to giving more opportunities to their children than they themselves experienced in life, America must rein in its own kleptocrats on Wall Street and end the descent into economic inequality that threatens our future.Comments (165)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Not even Democrats still use the phrase \"the public good.\" Public goods are now, at best, \"public investments.\" Public institutions have morphed into \"public-private partnerships\" or, for Republicans, simply \"vouchers.\"Comments (78)Bryan AppleyardSpecial feature writer, The Sunday TimesThe internet turned anonymity into a new norm. People became accustomed to communicating with unidentified strangers. However, these were a new type of human, a type whose moral agency was eliminated by anonymity.Comments (38)Jenni SchaeferSpeaker, Singer and Author of Almost Anorexic (released by Harvard Health Publications \u0026 Hazelden in July 2013); Goodbye Ed, Hello Me; Life Without EdOn planes and at parties, Dr. Thomas and I are often asked, \"How can I become almost anorexic?\", as if engaging in eating disorder symptoms at an average or above-average body weight is benign or even desirable.Comments (50)Ken ReedSports Policy Director, League of FansSitting around an outside table at a restaurant near our home, we were sharing news our youngest child didn\u0027t want to hear: Mom and Dad were not going to let her play soccer anymore.CommentsWymselBlooger, wondermentetc.comWe\u0027re moms without children. It\u0027s an ache that doesn\u0027t go away. It starts before we see their faces and only ends when they\u0027re in our arms.Comments (139)David BrakeFreelance writer, script developer#9: Ryan Gosling was cast as Noah in The Notebook because the director wanted someone \"not handsome.\"CommentsTess MunsterPlus size model, make up artist, blogger, activistModeling, and especially living your life in the public eye, is by far the hardest thing I\u0027ve ever done. We are breeding a generation of young girls and guys who think their worth is based on their looks and how many \"likes\" they get. You can say \"It\u0027s always been this way,\" but I can tell you, it hasn\u0027t.Comments (65)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorWhy would you allow one of our country\u0027s most aggressive tax dodgers, a company with a track record of overtly ripping off our government, into your country?Comments (57)Raymond J. LearsyAuthor, \u0027Ruminations on the Distortion of Oil Prices and Crony Capitalism\u0027JPMorgan, so accustomed to the profits of their prop trading not to speak of their full court press to dismantle Dodd-Frank, presumes it is being bullied, that, all in all, it is but \"a tempest in a teapot\" -- which should become their corporate logo.CommentsPatrice E. AthanasidyWriterOne of my problems with the letter is it confirmed something I have known for years. Those looks -- the ones we have gotten in stores, on the street, at the playground, at church -- some of those looks match this woman\u0027s words. I had hoped I was interpreting them incorrectly.Comments (24)Amy TraubSenior Policy Analyst at DemosRather than lamenting the \"challenging\" and \"disappointing\" retail environment, Walmart could boldly move to reshape it. The key step? Raising the company\u0027s notoriously low wages.Comments (22)Rep. Barbara Lee and Kenneth ColeWe now have the effective tools and improved policies necessary to begin to end the AIDS epidemic in America, but our biggest challenges lie ahead.CommentsJeff DanzigerPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideComments (104)Peter G TatchellHuman rights campaigner; director, Peter Tatchell FoundationBradley Manning has been sentenced to 35 years jail for releasing to WikiLeaks classified documents that exposed US war crimes, lies and cover-ups, while the people who committed these criminal acts have never been prosecuted. What kind of justice system jails the person who reveals a crime, while allowing the crime perpetrators to walk away scot-free?Comments (168)Thomas McKennaEditorial Fellow at The Huffington PostWith one unforgettable motion, Iverson quite literally and emphatically stepped over the fallen Lue and silenced the adjacent Lakers bench with a single glance. Broadcasters Marv Albert and Doug Collins could be heard oohing and aahing with exhilaration at Iverson\u0027s display.CommentsDonna HighfillWriter, Coach, Humorist, and Change ConsultantFour weeks ago life was normal. My husband visited the doctor for his annual physical and went through the motions of carrying liquids in a cup down the hallway and having blood drawn while carrying on that awkward conversation that occurs when trying to ignore needles piercing your skin.Comments (191)Angela GrayStoryteller, JustAnge.comSince the day my son was born, I have had my parenthood challenged. These days I walk down the street with my son and sometimes see a look of confusion from the passersby. I have joked that I walk around with my son and some people may think I am his nanny.Comments (23)Seamus McKiernanAssociate Blog Editor, The Huffington PostBefore you forget, email the link to your Liberal/Conservative/Fun/Mean uncle who agrees/disagrees with you on everything. The subject line could read: \"Thought of you\" but there should be no text in the email body. Just a link. \u0027CC\u0027 12 members of your extended family and two old college buddies.CommentsVanessa Van EdwardsAuthor, Professional People WatcherDo people annoy you on Facebook? Would you issue them a social citation?PleaseStopNoSeriouslyStopIt.com is going to help you stop the annoying people on Facebook...or at least send them a warning.Comments (75)Peter DiamandisChairman/CEO, X PRIZE FoundationWhen we launch an XPRIZE, we do so with the understanding that it may not achieve its objectives -- either because we made the finish line too difficult, or sometimes because we did not make it hard enough.Comments (32)Brynn TannehillDefense research scientistBeyond the philosophical and medical argument of what makes a \"real\" man or woman, there is the simple level of civility. When you deliberately attack someone\u0027s core identity you have foregone the basic rules of decency.Comments (122)Pastor Rick HendersonPastor, blogger and grace addictWhen I was a kid I could tell the difference between the kids who wanted to be my friend from the kids who were my friends so that they could play with my toys. Joel and Joyce are the latter. They preach a twisted form of Christianity that teaches obedience, giving and faith as a way to get things from God.Comments (920)Arianna Huffington, 2013.22.08Mohamed A.
