{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOPresident Obama delivered a powerful State of the Union speech. Conveyed with passion and emotion, it will be remembered for many things. The speech\u0027s longer term impact will also depend on whether the economic messages, including the urgency of growing America from the middle out, resonate loudly and durably both inside and outside Washington, DC. Trained as an economist, I sat down to listen to the speech with expectations and hope. I came away cautiously optimistic that, given proper follow-up, its content could do more than just nudge Congress towards more constructive economic behaviors. The speech was refreshing, contained new ideas and avoided bitter partisanship. In the process, it encouraged all Americans to ensure that Congress does not keep on hitting the snooze button. Let me explain why using four different personal perspectives.Read Post | CommentsWilliam Galston, 02/12/13Senior Fellow, Brookings InstitutionAlthough the State of the Union was less about progressive principles than was the second inaugural, its tone and substance extended few olive branches to the Republicans. For a while, anyway, Obama is committed to an outside-in strategy.Read Post | CommentsJared Bernstein, 02/12/13Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorClearly, in an economy where for decades growth has failed to reach our lowest wage workers, it\u0027s time to raise the wage floor to ensure that low-wage workers have a decent shot at a fair wage.Read Post | Comments (24)Garry Wills, 02/12/13Author, \u0027Why Priests?: A Failed Tradition\u0027We live in a time when Catholic priests are an aging and shrinking group, damaged in morale and reputation, overstretched in their monopolization of all sacramental services. Lay deacons and catechizers and readers, instructors for baptism and marriage, are filling in for the diminished priestly ranks in Catholic parishes. What we really need are no priests.Read Post | Comments (385)Marlo Thomas, 02/12/13Award-winning actress, author and activistAs Valentine\u0027s Day approaches, it might surprise you to know that, according to the US Census Bureau, there are 97 million Americans that are over 45, and 40 percent of them are single! That\u0027s more than 32 million singles out there, and that means a lot of potential love matches.Read Post | Comments (132)William Bradley, 02/12/13Political Analyst, NewWestNotes.comAmerica has serious issues to deal with, many of them raised by Obama in his laundry list State of the Union addresses. But let\u0027s not pretend the State of the Union itself is not an empty institution -- bloated, hollow, self-congratulatory, increasingly shallow, largely irrelevant.Read Post | CommentsAl Gore, 02/12/13Chairman, Generation Investment Management and The Climate Reality ProjectWe are facing a rapidly closing window of opportunity to avert the worst consequences of the climate crisis and steer our country and -- with U.S. leadership -- the world, on a path of sustainability.Read Post | Comments (76)Keith Thomson, 02/12/13writerMuch is at stake with the selection of Pope Benedict XVI\u0027s successor, including a lot of money.Read Post | Comments (12)Arianna Huffington, 02/11/13The big news about President Obama\u0027s fifth State of the Union speech tomorrow night is that it\u0027s going to focus on \"job creation\" and \"economic growth.\" But it\u0027s what comes after the speech that\u0027s important. Or, I should say, between this speech and the next one, since jobs and the economy have made regular appearances in his four previous State of the Union speeches.Read Post | Comments (515)Robert Reich, 02/12/13Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Big lies can do great damage in a democracy. This one could help Republicans in their coming showdowns. But it could keep the economy in first gear for years, right up through the 2014 midterm elections, maybe all the way to the next presidential election.Read Post | Comments (60)Max Tegmark, 02/12/13Physicist, MITIs there a conflict between science and religion?
