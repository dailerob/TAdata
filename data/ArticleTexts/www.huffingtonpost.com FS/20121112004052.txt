{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, Obama won, Romney lost, rape turned out to be 2012\u0027s most surprising campaign issue, and Karl Rove refused to believe the math -- while his not-so-super Super PAC blamed its misspent $300 million on \"very, very weak candidates.\" But it wasn\u0027t the GOP\u0027s candidates that were to blame; it was the party\u0027s narrow and sclerotic message. Romney actually attracted the vote of his party\u0027s usual coalition. But that\u0027s not enough anymore. The numbers aren\u0027t there, and are trending away from Republicans. \"It\u0027s not a traditional America anymore,\" lamented Bill O\u0027Reilly. \"The white establishment is now a minority\" -- replaced in his telling by black and brown people \"who want stuff.\" Indeed they do; stuff like immigration reform, affordable health care, reproductive rights, and economic justice. For a two-party system to be healthy, both parties need to be in good shape. Right now the Republican Party is badly in need of a soul transplant.Read Post | Comments (348)Aaron Belkin, 11/08/12Author, \u0027How We Won: Progressive Lessons from the Repeal of \"Don\u0027t Ask, Don\u0027t Tell\"\u0027As the planet continues to warm and the seas continue to rise with no chance of a meaningful policy response from Washington, perhaps it is time for Senator Reid to do whatever he can to gut this antiquated and anti-democratic rule.Read Post | Comments (585)Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, 11/09/12U.S. Senator from New YorkThis week saw a historic election for women, both on the ballot and at the ballot box. Women who run for office today will inspire more of our young women and girls to do so in the future, so we can one day get to 51 percent representation.Read Post | Comments (195)Mohamed A. El-Erian, 11/07/12CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOOn Tuesday, America and Americans sent a clear signal that they understand the importance of supporting each other during times of continued economic stress and \"unusual uncertainty.\" We now need our elected representatives to put the interests of the country ahead of the legacy of backward-looking and outdated partisan commitments. And we need them to do so quickly.Read Post | Comments (296)Arianna Huffington, 11/08/12Stress -- it\u0027s one of the most harmful forces in our lives. That\u0027s why I\u0027m happy to announce that all 13 of our lifestyle sections -- from Travel and Parents to Weddings and Divorce -- have an editorial mission to help our readers travel with less stress, parent with less stress, get married with less stress and, yes, get divorced with less stress.Read Post | Comments (102)Bishop James Magness, 11/10/12Bishop Suffragan, Federal Ministries of The Episcopal ChurchFor people of faith, the significant challenge is whether or not we will recognize, remember and care for those who have served us in uniform during the other 364 days of the year.Read Post | Comments (51)Rosario Dawson, 11/07/12Actress; Co-founder, Voto LatinoThey\u0027ve come out of the shadows to fight for their families and themselves.

What are the the tolls of new temptations?Read Post | Comments (114)Doug Bandow, 11/11/12Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteI\u0027m not thrilled with President Obama\u0027s victory. Still, I have to admit that Mitt Romney\u0027s loss left me with at least a half smile on my face. There is little more satisfying than seeing the arrogant, whoever they are, get their comeuppance.Read Post | Comments (57)David Lynch, 11/05/12Award-winning director, writer, producerProbably a lot of you would say I\u0027m just another nut rolling out of Hollywood and I should stick to filmmaking or whatever and not voice my opinion about politics. But still I am an American.Read Post | Comments (117)Russell Simmons, 11/07/12Founder, GlobalGrind.comAmerica is changing, the middle class and poor need support, and every politician who is not ready for this change should wake today and realize that minorities will wait in line into the early hours of the morning to vote them out of office. Forward, we go.Read Post | Comments (246)Lisa Belkin, 11/09/12Senior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, The Huffington PostPowerful men use sex in ways that powerful women don\u0027t. What is unclear is why. If -- when -- the scales balance (the last election was a good start) we will likely learn that it isn\u0027t just sex that means different things to men and women, but also power. Until then, the parade of cheating men will inevitably march on.Read Post | Comments (887)Trita Parsi and Reza Marashi, 11/07/12With the elections behind him, President Obama must quickly shift his focus to key foreign policy challenges that were put on pause due to election season paralysis. On Iran, the president should hit the ground running.Read Post | Comments (169)Pamela Meyer, 11/09/12Founder and CEO, CalibrateEspecially when it comes to perpetrating crime and enabling malice, we live in an age when lying and deceit are increasingly tolerated, and not necessarily the exception. High-stakes lying is out of control.Read Post | Comments (1,048)Gordon Brown, 11/09/12Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationOne month after the terrible shooting of Malala Yousafzai, I met with the president of Pakistan to discuss Malala\u0027s dream of education for all.Read Post | CommentsRuth Bettelheim, Ph.D. and Geralynn S. Knorr, MS CCC, 11/10/12We know that traumatic brain injury increases rates of suicide and that it is the \"signature injury\" of the current wars. Yet it frequently goes undetected, or is misdiagnosed as PTSD or depression. Patients who are misdiagnosed, and therefore mistreated, are unlikely to recover. Instead, they are likely to despair.Read Post | Comments (51)Kal Penn and Natalie Foster, 11/09/12The election is over, but the fight isn\u0027t. We know that we can break through the gridlock in Congress, but only by increasing pressure on our representatives in their home districts. If we speak with one voice, they\u0027ll hear us.Read Post | Comments (34)Marian Wright Edelman, 11/09/12President, Children\u0027s Defense FundTo move forward, America\u0027s security and prosperity depend on our children\u0027s ability to drive the economy of the future. Leaders must craft budget solutions that will protect the already porous safety nets on which so many children and families rely.Read Post | Comments (42)Gary Hart, 11/10/12President, Hart International, Ltd.No one argues that resumption of pre-Bush tax rates on the wealthiest 1 percent will solve the deficit problem. What we do argue is equity -- fairness. The entire idea of progressive taxes is that those who benefit the most from our nation\u0027s services should pay a fair share.Read Post | Comments (259)Kate Fridkis, 11/09/12Blogger, Eat The Damn CakeI\u0027m not exercising at all. And I should be. Because that is what conscientious people who respect their bodies do. Sex doesn\u0027t count. Does it count? Should I do it more aerobically? How?Read Post | Comments (54)Jim Wallis, 11/08/12Christian leader for social changeThe results of the presidential election showed how dramatically a very diverse America is changing; people are longing for a vision of the common good that includes everyone.Read Post | Comments (230)Linda Bergthold, 11/06/12Health policy consultantThe reelection of Obama is no guarantee that the law will retain all of its provisions. What we can guarantee is that, as citizens, you need to be vigilant and keep your eyes on the implementation of Obamacare -- if you care about seeing this law completely implemented.Read Post | Comments (635)Steve Schmidt and Mark Hass, 11/09/12Transitions almost inevitably will turn into steep roller coaster rides, but with thoughtful and forthright management, they can be turned into productive experiences for everyone involved.Read Post | CommentsMichael Moore, 11/07/12Oscar and Emmy-winning directorCongratulations, everyone!! This country has truly changed, and I believe there will be no going back. Hate lost Tuesday. That is amazing in and of itself. And all the women who were elected!
