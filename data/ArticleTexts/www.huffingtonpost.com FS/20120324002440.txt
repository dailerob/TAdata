{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressSaying that Mitt Romney will say anything to win an election, and is a sell-out betrayer of conservative principles waiting to happen, carries a sting -- it goes right to the heart of conservative unease with Romney. Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum really have no other choice than to pursue it with relish. But pursue it though they may, they will not, in all likelihood, win. It\u0027s a different story entirely if Barack Obama tries to use it. It surely won\u0027t cause the spirits of conservative voters to flag -- when Obama tells them that Romney will say anything it takes to win, their reply will be, \"Yeah, here\u0027s hoping.\"Read Post | Comments (58)Mike Lux, 03/23/12Co-founder and CEO, Progressive StrategiesThe Ryan budget is the most radical, repeal-the-20th Century budget document I have read in 30 years of politics, and Romney\u0027s and the entire Republican Party\u0027s embrace of it makes it quite literally impossible to Etch-A-Sketch anything away.Read Post | Comments (37)Jonathan Kirby, 03.23.2012VP of Global Men\u0027s DesignIn the spirit of World Water Week, Levi Strauss \u0026 Co. -- in partnership with Water.org -- invites you to help us raise awareness for the 1 billion people worldwide who lack access to water.Read Post | Comments (1)Arianna Huffington, 03/22/12Smart delevering isn\u0027t just about cutting -- and the relentless emphasis on cutting has obscured the more important question of what is being cut.

The only evidence of self-defense comes from the person who shot the victim. Doesn\u0027t he have a motive to lie? Isn\u0027t his credibility an issue?
