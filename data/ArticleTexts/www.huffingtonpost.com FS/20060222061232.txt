{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"From europarl.eu.intFrom yahoo.comAP/Ron EdmondsOn Hannity and Colmes last night, with Ann Coulter, it dawned on me that she is the right wing punditry\u0027s equivalent of crack or crystal meth. She\u0027s highly addictive -- giving users the delirious, giddy high of outrageousness. But then the buzz wears off and they come crashing down, their spirits shriveled, their souls poisoned.
