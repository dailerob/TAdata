{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressSpend any time reading the people whose job it is to assign heady unified field theorems to election years, and you will hear sad variations on a dull theme. The 2014 midterm election is a hard-to-pin-down mystery. No one can figure out what it\u0027s supposed to be about. Or maybe the election is about nothing. You know, the null set of things? Or maybe the election is secretly about everything, which is really just a more philosophical way of saying it\u0027s about nothing.Let us send a clear and unequivocal signal that failure to act will have consequences at the ballot box for politicians and for the bottom line of businesses. If leaders are unwilling to lead when leadership is required, people must.Former UN Secretary GeneralThe national media is in the midst of another season of self-loathing, and with good reason. The coverage of politics often is as trivial as politics itself. So it was with a sense of relief and gratitude that I joined some 500 others recently to give thanks for and pay tribute to Diane Rehm.Editorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupNote to all hard news outlets: you know what\u0027d be a nice change of pace? Switch the red and blue color-coding every election cycle, and stop finding new ways to divide the country through simplistic metaphors.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027While the threat posed by the Islamic State to U.S. interests has been made all too clear, the shift in public opinion and its influence on the political debate in Washington over the use of military force raises important questions about the America\u0027s capacity to effectively wage the ongoing global war on terrorism.Assistant Professor, St. John’s UniversityI want men to take up this mantle. So their daughters, sisters and mothers can be free from prejudice but also so that their sons have permission to be vulnerable and human too -- reclaim those parts of themselves they abandoned and in doing so be a more true and complete version of themselves.Actor and UN Women Global Goodwill AmbassadorThose of us in the academy should be asking ourselves what more can we do to confront one of the most urgent and consequential challenges facing our civilization.President, Harvard UniversityPresident, Stanford UniversityThis week I was joined by over 500 youth advocates for education and education activists to launch the #UpForSchool petition in New York. World leaders including the United Nations Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, have backed the petition. So, too have major faith-based organizations, including the World Evangelical Alliance and Sojourners -- both members of Global Faith Coalition on Education.Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationThis is a 3-minute film to be shown at the UN in front of world leaders who have probably already made up their minds. If it gains a life on the net afterward -- and that is the hope -- maybe it will empower people to put pressure on their world leaders.Co-founder, Environmental Media AssociationWe have the central bank of the US acting deliberately to keep workers from getting pay increases. They justify their actions over concerns about inflation, but we need not take these seriously.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027I am part of Black America; I was born into it by virtue of the color of my skin. No matter where I am in my life, that part of me will always be my first identifier.Pediatric and sports dentist, model, philanthropist, and founder of Project SmileWe all know that banning books is wrong. So why is it so tempting?Executive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostToday, it is interests of the fossil fuel industries -- not technology nor economics -- which are the only obstacle to securing a safe future for us and our children on this planet.Executive Director, Greenpeace InternationalNothing better illustrates the bankruptcy of the Obama administration\u0027s foreign policy than funding groups that turn on the U.S. again and again, a neo-con fueled cycle of profits for war makers and destruction of ever-shifting \"enemies.\"Former 16-year member of the U.S. Congress and two-time U.S. presidential candidateHistory isn\u0027t just a set of boring facts and dates; it can have marvelous healing powers.Alphonse Fletcher University Professor and Director of the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research at Harvard UniversityAt a certain point, we will discover ourselves unable to outlaw or repent or pray away the carbon dioxide and methane blanketing the planet. If that time comes, no change of mind or heart or law will be able to derail our rendez-vous with catastrophe.USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorCritics have expressed legitimate concerns about U.S. conspiracy law, saying it\u0027s too easy to convict some people accused of low-level terrorist assistance and sentence them to hard time in highly restrictive prisons. But the claim that the U.S. prison system gives terrorists rights that ought to be reserved for U.S. citizens is simply impossible to support.Senior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstWe\u0027ve already entered the period when strategy, such as it is, falls away, and our leaders feel strangely helpless before the drip, drip, drip of failure and the unbearable urge for further escalation.Editor, TomDispatch.comGreater life balance lies within your reach. Focus on the big picture and keep in mind that small investments of time in the right places can transform your well-being and relationships.Psychologist | Author | Educator, DrRandyKamen.comHow should a teacher react if a student arrives to class wearing a t-shirt that shouts a repugnant racial slur in large, all capital letters across the chest? The answer ought to be clear.High school Physics and Astronomy teacherThe war on drugs is a cruel joke. The U.S. spends more than $50 billion a year on the \"war on drugs\" with the goal of creating a \"drug-free society\" -- yet there has never been a \"drug-free society\" in the history of civilization.Director of Media Relations, Drug Policy AllianceOne of the best parts of getting older is the freedom found in letting go of habits that used to hedge me in because of what I thought other people expected of me, only to discover that many of these expectations either aren\u0027t real or don\u0027t matter.President \u0026 Chief Culture Officer, CAbiWe are not passive receptacles of ancient wisdom but active practitioners of faith in a world that seems to grow less certain and more hostile by the minute. Including millennials in a conversation about faith-based climate activism -- and any other spiritual and social topic for that matter -- is not only logical but necessary.Associate Editor, HuffPost ReligionResearchers, who analyzed data from 187 countries, reported that more than 1.6 million cardiovascular-related deaths per year can be attributed to sodium consumption above 2 grams per day. Almost no country or region is immune. Salt is fueling the global hypertension epidemic.There is perhaps no more illustrative example of the vulnerability of low-lying subway stations in the city than the story of South Ferry. Sandy poured 15 million gallons of salt water into the station, destroying its entire power system.Multimedia reporter and producer covering sustainable food, design, travel, and technology.We need hundreds of Zephyr Teachouts, ready to challenge straying Dems -- whenever and wherever they break their campaign promises, shift their allegiances to the corporate \"dark side,\" or forget to \"dance with the ones who brought \u0027em.\" You can call that \"civil war\" if you like. I prefer the term \"democracy.\"Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourWe are living in the year 2014 and we are still fighting for equality between men and women. We are still fighting for equal rights and equal pay. Women should not have to feel afraid to walk alone at night. Women should not be afraid to speak their voices loud and clear. Women should not be afraid to want a higher education, to want to learn.Associate Editor, Blogs \u0026 CommunityAmerica is now fighting the Iraq War for the third time, somehow madly expecting different results, while guaranteeing only failure. To paraphrase a young John Kerry, himself back from Vietnam, who\u0027ll be the last to die for that endless mistake? It seems as if it will be many years before we know.Author of \"Ghosts of Tom Joad: A Story of the #99Percent\" and \"We Meant Well\"Not a cook? Fine. But you might want to learn how to make a proper mac and cheese or try your hand at baking -- before it\u0027s too late and you have to speed to Boston Market to buy a dilapidated apple pie and sub-par side.Food and Taste Blog Editor, The Huffington PostLast spring, I invited a guy to my Indiana college fraternity\u0027s formal. I realized, though, that my fraternity brothers had never actually seen me with another guy. To them, I was \"gay in theory.\" Would they be as accepting when they saw me dancing beard-to-beard with my date?Student, Butler UniversityThere\u0027s no other public figure active in the U.S. political arena today (possibly other than the one who currently occupies the Oval Office) who\u0027s been more scrutinized by the media, who\u0027s endured more \"scandal\" coverage, who has been thoroughly trashed by the partisan press opponents, and who still comes out the other side marching on. So now what?Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"WAR RAGES...
