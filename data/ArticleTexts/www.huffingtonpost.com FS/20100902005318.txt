{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Christian leader for social changeThe president asked the nation to \"turn the page\" last night. But what makes me so sad this morning is the enormous human cost of the war in Iraq; and how a massive number of people and families -- in America and Iraq -- have had their lives ended or changed forever because of this war and will have a hard time turning the page. So was the war in Iraq worth the enormous human cost?Read Post | CommentsBob Cesca, 09.01.2010Host of the Bob and Elvis ShowWhile everyone is focused on the crowd sizes or Glenn Beck\u0027s tall tale about holding in his bare hands George Washington\u0027s inaugural address at the National Archives, the more important questions ought to be about the money.Read Post | CommentsRichard N. Haass, 09.01.2010President, Council on Foreign RelationsThe fifty thousand U.S. troops still in Iraq are there to advise and assist. But what happens if Iraqis cannot deal successfully with the continuing threat posed by terrorists, their own sectarian divides, and the meddling of neighbors?Read Post | CommentsJason Linkins, 09.01.2010If you had come to me in the past couple of years and told me that you were working on a movie called Clear Blue Tuesday, I would have said, \"Wow! A movie about feminine hygiene products?\"Read Post | CommentsSimon Jenkins, 09.01.2010Writer for the Guardian and the London Sunday TimesThe west is leaving Iraq in a pool of blood, dust and dollars. It remains wedded to Iraq\u0027s twin sister in folly, Afghanistan.Read Post | CommentsRoger Hickey, 09.01.2010Co-Director of the Campaign for America\u0027s FutureAlan Simpson has been blunt about the plan to steal money from the Social Security trust fund, but he\u0027s really not unique. He resembles most others on the commission.Read Post | CommentsBen Sherwood, 09.01.2010Author, Journalist, Founder and CEO of TheSurvivorsClub.orgMagill\u0027s story may sound like one in a million but it\u0027s not especially surprising if you delve into the obscure world of free falling. It turns out that people tumble from great heights all the time and survive.Read Post | CommentsChris Kelly, 09.01.2010Writer, Real Time with Bill MaherThe way Sarah Palin fixes a political opponent, in a close election in Alaska, is by saying they\u0027re soft on abortion. The Republicans do have a jobs plan. And it\u0027s all babysitters.Read Post | CommentsRobert Naiman, 09.01.2010Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicyThe Iraq war is not over. This is not a left-wing critique. The consensus of the mainstream U.S. print media is that the 50,000 U.S. troops who remain there have been rebranded from \"combat\" brigades to \"advise-and-assist\" brigades.Read Post | CommentsIsabel Kaplan, 09.01.2010Novelist and Harvard studentA new dating service for male Harvard grads boasts that it gives women \"total control\" over the online dating process. An online dating system that promotes female empowerment? Not so much.Read Post | CommentsWilliam Bradley, 09.01.2010California-based Political Analyst NewWestNotes.comThe first part of this season is more pleasant to watch than the first part of last season. But until we know where we\u0027re going this season, I\u0027m not sure how consequential it will all turn out to be.Read Post | CommentsMarshall Fine, 09.01.2010Author and film critic, hollywoodandfine.comIt seems like a weirdly cross-cultural idea: Chinese master Zhang Yimou does a remake of the Coen brothers\u0027 debut film, Blood Simple. If the film lacks the dryly mordant Coen wit, it offers other pleasures -- but also some problems.Read Post | CommentsRep. John Conyers, 09.01.2010Chairman, House Judiciary CommitteeAs we remember the five-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, I strongly urge Ken Feinberg, the Administrator of the Gulf Coast Claims Facility, to reverse his decision not to pay victims\u0027 mental health claims.Read Post | CommentsAmy Goodman, 09.01.2010Host, executive producer of Democracy Now!, NYT bestselling author, syndicated columnist\"The women of Congo saved my life,\" said the author of The Vagina Monologues, who is currently battling uterine cancer. \"Every day I get up, and I think to myself, I can keep going.\"Read Post | CommentsTerry O\u0027Neill, 09.01.2010President, National Organization for WomenExactly who is Obama looking for \"cover\" from? How many Republicans will be persuaded by a Democratic President\u0027s contortions to display \"fiscal responsibility\" -- which in this case means throwing the middle class under a bus?Read Post | CommentsRobert Creamer, 09.01.2010Political organizer, strategist and authorIt is really pretty remarkable to ponder how far the modern Republican Party has strayed from the vision of Lincoln, the Great Emancipator -- and Teddy Roosevelt, the Conservationist and Trust Buster.Read Post | CommentsBarbara J. Easterling, 09.01.2010President, Alliance for Retired AmericansImagine if Social Security were put on trial. There isn\u0027t a judge in the land that would let Alan Simpson, the co-chair of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, stay on the jury.Read Post | CommentsDavid Katz, M.D., 09.01.2010Dr. Katz is the Director of Yale University\u0027s Prevention Research CenterThe massive demands and ramifications of an ever-more-massive human population may be the root of the roots of many of our most urgent crises.Read Post | CommentsRobert Scheer, 09.01.2010Veteran Journalist and Editor of Truthdig.comObama deserves credit for extracting this country from a war in Iraq that he inherited, but it is mind-numbing that in his nation-building efforts in Afghanistan he is now repeating the same errors that were made in Iraq.Read Post | CommentsRev. Jesse Jackson, 09.01.2010Civil rights activistWe honor our troops who risk their lives for our country on the battlefield. We honor them and their families who have paid the ultimate price. But we remain convinced that not a single life should have been lost in Iraq.Read Post | CommentsRep. Luis Gutierrez, 09.01.2010CongressmanIf credit checks reinforce discrimination, don\u0027t accurately measure financial responsibility, and don\u0027t dependably predict job performance, why are so many employers using them?Read Post | CommentsMichael Brenner, 09.01.2010Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic RelationsThe Obama administration is turning its alchemic powers toward Palestine. It is aiming to fashion a \u0027success\u0027 out of the shambles created by its lame failure to stand up to the Israeli government of Bibi Netanyahu.Read Post | CommentsAndrew Gunther, 09.01.2010Program Director, Animal Welfare ApprovedNews that an \"efficient and environmentally sustainable\" genetically modified salmon may be a step closer to commercial release had me reaching for a large pinch of salt -- and not to help season the dish.Read Post | CommentsArianna Huffington, 08.30.2010The president\u0027s stepping back from his promise to call us to a higher form of civic engagement means that a vacuum has been left during this historic moment of transition in America.Read Post | CommentsDavid Berri, 08.31.2010Co-author of \"Stumbling on Wins\", Professor of Economics at Southern Utah UniversityAlthough scoring totals often coincide with perceptions of a player\u0027s value, scoring alone does a poor job of capturing a player\u0027s overall contribution to a team. The number of wins produced is a better metric.Read Post | CommentsMitchell Bard, 08.31.2010Writer and FilmmakerPolicy debates are a good thing. But what is not useful for democracy is for partisans to knowingly lie about the facts in play to make an argument that plays to their rigid ideological position.Read Post | CommentsEthan Murrow, 2010.09.02Tammy H.
