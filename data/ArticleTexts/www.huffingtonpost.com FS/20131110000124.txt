{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundA recent report from Human Impact Partners (HIP), Family Unity, Family Health, highlights the need to protect children’s rights and keep families together during immigration reform to ensure children’s health. Family-focused immigration reform would result in better child health. Our current immigration policies push families apart and children into illness and poverty. HIP projects that if current policies remain unchanged, 43,000 U.S. citizen children will experience a decline in health status, 100,000 will develop signs of withdrawal, and over 125,000 will go hungry in the next year. Children of undocumented immigrants — the majority of whom are U.S. citizens — will continue to suffer from trauma and fear of deportation which can lead to costly health consequences in their adult lives.Comments (58)TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"Is that a painting -- or a person?

I need to save $1,100 A MONTH to send my children to college almost 20 years from now?!? That is insanity.Comments (739)Paul SlanskyWriter; Contributor to The New YorkerI would love to live in a country where the next time any Republican mentions \"Benghazi,\" just one lonely reporter says, \"You know, you people have been screaming \u0027Benghazi\u0027 like some kind of demented mantra for over a year now. Benghazi was a tragedy, to be sure, but let\u0027s put it in some kind of perspective, shall we?Comments (342)Michael ShawPublisher of the visual politics and media literacy site, BagNewsNotesThe photos and scholarship surrounding Hitler\u0027s touring the 1938 Nazi Art Exhibition (and every one from 1937 through 1944) isn\u0027t exactly unknown. But that\u0027s the point. Apparently, we can\u0027t get enough of Hitler.CommentsClaire FallonDeputy Blog Editor, The Huffington PostA younger and much less wise version of myself once had a crush on a certain boy. He was cute, he was smart, and he was just a little bit too full of himself. In other words, he was my Darcy. Whenever we ran into each other, we bantered, exchanged barbs, and even argued. It was fate.Comments (16)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027In Texas, the State Board of Education will recommend new textbooks for all its students -- and because it has such a large population, what they decide could determine what students in other states learn about science.Comments (415)Elizabeth PerleSenior EditorWe cannot blame teen girls for the ferociously sexist social environment they have no choice but to live in. Maybe what the girls in these YouTube videos are saying isn\u0027t: I don\u0027t feel pretty. Maybe it\u0027s actually: I feel completely powerless when it comes to my sexuality.Comments (36)Mark GodseyDirector, Ohio Innocence Project; Carmichael Professor of Law, University of Cincinnati College of LawToday in Texas, former prosecutor and judge Ken Anderson pled guilty to intentionally failing to disclose evidence in a case that sent an innocent man, Michael Morton, to prison for the murder of his wife.CommentsHoward FinemanEditorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupNo, Obamacare didn’t almost cost Terry McAuliffe his narrow gubernatorial victory in Virginia. But dodging that bullet shouldn’t be much comfort to other Democrats.Comments (2,515)Dan TreadwayWriterThe stigma surrounding cat ownership isn\u0027t too difficult to figure out. Owning a dog is generally associated with an active, healthy lifestyle. Owning a cat is generally associated with owning a couch. Dog owners visit dog parks. Cat owners visit Reddit.Comments (63)Les LeopoldAuthor, \"How to Make a Million Dollars an Hour\" (Wiley 2013)All in all, you could not have designed a more perfect program to enrich the rich and do absolutely nothing for the 99 percent -- and as a result, sink ever more children into poverty.Comments (715)Kerry CoddettComedianIf SNL isn\u0027t finding great black female talent, maybe it\u0027s because the characters we want to play don\u0027t fall in line with the caricatures they\u0027re used to seeing. Maybe it\u0027s SNL that isn\u0027t ready -- to be progressive, break tradition and have a writing team that isn\u0027t 95 percent white for once.CommentsChristella MorrisMother; Blogger, crawltheline.comWhat if nobody gave my boys presents anymore? What if we only gave GIFTS.Comments (16)Rabbi Shmuley BoteachRabbi and WriterNow again I am traumatized by a shooting. How many more will die before America finally wakes up?Comments (64)Dana StarfieldScreenwriterNovember 1, 2013 was the luckiest and most traumatizing day of my life.

Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThese numbers paint a pretty different, and more positive, picture of recent job growth than even the last jobs report, which came out just a few weeks ago on Oct 22 due to the shutdown.Comments (20)Izmael ArkinNinja and former middle school teacherMy name is Izzy.

For women, the numbers are 14 percent and 10 percent respectively. But the reasons are different.Comments (35)David FurnishFilm director and producer; Chairman, Elton John AIDS FoundationThe government regulatory bodies were insisting on such a slow testing process that they were effectively condemning to death anybody who was diagnosed with HIV. As far as the authorities were concerned, the message was, \"Go die quietly.\" They clearly hadn\u0027t met Larry Kramer.CommentsWilliam HartungDirector, Arms and Security Project, Center for International PolicyBefore we let exaggerated cries of a readiness crisis scare us into letting the Pentagon off the hook on further budget cuts, we need to think harder about what we want our armed forces to be ready to do.Comments (40)Bishop Gene RobinsonThe Rt. Rev. V. Gene Robinson, Bishop of New Hampshire, USA. Visiting Senior Fellow at the Center for American Progress.The debate surrounding the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), which just passed in the U.S. Senate, has a number of religious leaders arguing against it. Sometimes, Jesus must just hold his head in his hands with embarrassment.Comments (538)Ann JonesAuthor, \u0027They Were Soldiers: How the Wounded Return From America’s Wars -- The Untold Story\u0027As I followed the sad trail of damaged veterans to write my new book, I came to see how much they and their families have suffered, like Afghans, from the delusions of this nation\u0027s leaders, more powerful and less accountable than themselves.Comments (178)Madeleine CrumAssociate Books Editor\"Like\" can serve two important, or at least forgivable, functions.

In fact, it seems like my fears have only increased as the project travels further out into the world and is seen by a wider audience.CommentsBenjamin Todd JealousPresident and CEO, NAACPIn a democracy, the people can win every time -- but only if we are organized. Today, when I reflect back on my half-decade at the helm of the NAACP, I am deeply proud of what we have accomplished together as we organized our communities.Comments (12)Doug BandowSenior Fellow, the Cato InstituteSecretary of State John Kerry has attempted to pacify the angry royals. Instead, the Obama administration should tell America\u0027s foreign \"friends\" that Washington acts in the interests of the American people, not corrupt dictators.Comments (51)Angelina ChapinBlogs Editor, Huffington Post CanadaIf there\u0027s a white-powdered lining to news that the mayor of the fourth-largest city in North America has a substance abuse problem, it\u0027s the opportunity to re-visit dangerous stereotypes about people who smoke crack.Comments (27)Lia ChavezVisual and performance artistThe works which I find most deeply satisfying to create are the ones which feel like gifts that I have received through some sort of bizarre or miraculous circumstance.CommentsLet Girls Lead, 2013. 9.11Jerry Lanson, 2013. 9.11Lisa Mirza Grotts, 2013. 9.11Kerry Patton, 2013. 9.11George Heymont, 2013. 9.11Jeffrey Walker, 2013. 9.11Marty Zwilling, 2013. 9.11Gregory Cendana, 2013. 9.11Stephen Baker, 2013. 9.11Dogster, 2013. 9.11Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"HAIYAN HELL",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BizYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
