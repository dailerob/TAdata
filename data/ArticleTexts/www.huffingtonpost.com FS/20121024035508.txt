{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Debates are much better with Twitter. And in case you missed the final one last night, instead of rewatching the actual debate, save yourself some time by just rerunning Twitter. Here are my tweets from last night to give you a quick snapshot of the Battle in Boca. READ MOREOn New Hips, Old Habits and the Inestimable Value of Giving Blood I\u0027m happy to announce that I\u0027ve just returned home from the hospital with a new arrival. I\u0027m not sure how much it weighs, but it seems to be healthy, and it\u0027s already walking -- albeit unsteadily and with a cane. I\u0027m talking about my brand-new hip, which was swapped in last Tuesday. The surgery -- as well as my blood transfusion the day after -- has opened my eyes and my heart to the issue of blood donations. It\u0027s a very humbling -- even overwhelming -- experience having someone else\u0027s generosity literally being pumped into your veins.

We should all wear both of them as we are all both of them, for to LIVE is to LIE.Read Post | Comments (249)David Wolman, 10.22.2012AuthorCash was one of history\u0027s greatest technologies. For millennia, cash turbo-boosted commerce and enabled trade between people and cultures across the globe. But in the 20th century, cash\u0027s relevance began to diminish.Read Post | Comments (24)Robert Reich, 10/22/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Although Monday night\u0027s topic was foreign policy, I hope Americans understood it was also about every other major challenge we face. Mitt Romney is not only a cold warrior; he\u0027s also a class warrior. And the two are closely related.Read Post | Comments (1,740)Arianna Huffington, 10/23/12Pushing back against the failures of our leaders and institutions is a growing movement of people and organizations taking the initiative to engage, connect, solve problems, share, and change their communities and the world. We see this in the people whose stories are featured in a new book, Everyday Heroes: 50 Americans Changing the World One Nonprofit at a Time.Read Post | CommentsKristen Breitweiser, 10/23/129/11 widow and activistWe are a nation of laws. We are a democracy. No act -- even a President\u0027s decision to green-light a drone strike half way around the world -- should ever go so utterly unchecked, unexamined, unstudied, and unconstitutional.Read Post | Comments (154)Marlo Thomas, 10/23/12Award-winning actress, author, and activistOctober is National Adopt a Shelter Dog Month and we found so many inspiring stories of adopted shelter dogs that have done amazing things -- from saving lives to detecting cancer -- that we decided to put together a collection of stories.Read Post | Comments (100)Alan Grayson, 10/23/12Former U.S. Congressman from Florida\u0027s 8th DistrictGood news and bad news. The good news is that President Obama won last night\u0027s debate. The bad news is that the entire debate, questions and answers, seemed premised on the false assumption that virtually everyone else on this planet wants to kill us.Read Post | Comments (51)Michael Brenner, 10/22/12Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghComplex problems, tough trade-offs, and the risks of being the world\u0027s indispensable power everywhere cannot be handled in sound bites. That tendency is reinforced this year by both candidates\u0027 own low comfort level with foreign affairs.Read Post | Comments (179)Dan Kennedy, 10/23/12Assistant Professor, School of Journalism at Northeastern UniversityBy dominating Romney on Monday night, Obama all but guaranteed a favorable media narrative for the final 15 days. But it won\u0027t be as bad for Romney as it was for Obama after the first debate. And that\u0027s because conservative pundits don\u0027t eat their own the way liberals do.Read Post | Comments (153)Ralph Nader, 10/23/12Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorShould the candidates care to consider and debate real solutions, they need not work too hard. The country is full of them -- applied here and there or ready on the shelf.Read Post | Comments (76)MC Hammer, 10/23/12Recording artistI\u0027m honored to be lending my time to the Yes on 34 campaign and to help them share the facts with California voters about the real costs of the death penalty. But with just two weeks left until the election, we need your help now to spread to word far and wide.Read Post | CommentsMarian Wright Edelman, 10/23/12President, Children\u0027s Defense FundCongress in 2011 mostly ignored the 16.1 million poor children and the 7.3 million extremely poor children in need. We cannot leave millions of children without hope or a vision of a future worth striving for in our materially powerful but spiritually poor nation.Read Post | CommentsRobert L. Borosage, 10/23/12President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureThere\u0027s a haunting Orwellian aura to Romney\u0027s shape shifting. Suddenly, the past is rewritten. Previous positions are, to use Nixon\u0027s phrase, \"inoperative.\" Utterly new positions are asserted as ones that have always been firmly held.Read Post | Comments (108)Imam Abdullah Antepli, 10/23/12Muslim Chaplain, Duke UniversityOne American\u0027s personal transformation through his Hajj experience changed the course of his personal history, and the history of his community, his country and beyond.Read Post | CommentsStacey Forman, 10/23/12Blogger at RelaxedMamaKids are awesome. They ask direct questions. They are genuinely curious. They mean no harm (under a certain age). Adults, though ... not so much.Read Post | Comments (53)Dr. Patricia Fitzgerald, 10/23/12Wellness Editor, The Huffington Post; Doctor of acupuncture and Oriental medicine; Nutritionist; AuthorBlood donations transcend gender, political affiliation, celebrity, status, and religion. It\u0027s interesting. People may be giving or receiving blood from those they might not even want to shake hands with. And my renewed appreciation is sending me to the nearest blood donation center.Read Post | Comments (12)Timothy Beal, 10/22/12Author, \u0027The Rise and Fall of the Bible\u0027It truly pains me to call you out on your decision to be party to this ad. You are allowing your voice, your face, indeed your \"brand,\" to be leveraged for a political cause that is beneath you.Read Post | Comments (507)Tracy Schorn, 10/23/12Journalist, Cartoonist, BloggerVery few people navigate infidelity gracefully. Accept that you\u0027re going to wobble and fail sometimes. It\u0027s okay.Read Post | Comments (114)Richard N. Haass, 10/23/12President, Council on Foreign RelationsA good deal can and will be said about Monday night\u0027s foreign policy debate, but the bottom line may be that it was not so much about foreign policy and not so much a debate.Read Post | Comments (26)Sophie-Alexandra Aiachi, 10/23/12Franco-Tunisian journalist and bloggerThe Constitution has not been drafted, the date of the next election has not been set, and we continue to plod through the various crises agitating our society and an economy that does not stop sinking.Read Post | CommentsHollye Harrington Jacobs, 10/23/12Nurse, Social Worker, Educator, Author www.TheSilverPen.comPain and sadness are important and valuable feelings that need to be processed during and after any rotten experience. The beauty of Silver Linings is that they don\u0027t take away the rain. Rather, they provide an umbrella.Read Post | Comments (19)Christy Turlington Burns and Jessica Zucker, Ph.D., 10/23/12When I began to travel across the U.S. with No Woman, No Cry, I was asked many thought-provoking questions about what I saw. One question that comes up consistently is about perinatal mood disorders, and more specifically about postpartum depression.Read Post | CommentsTom Engelhardt, 10/23/12Editor, TomDispatch.comObesity is an American plague -- and no, I\u0027m not talking about overweight Americans. I\u0027m talking about Big Election, the thing that\u0027s moved into our homes and, especially if you live in a \"swing state,\" is now hogging your television almost 24/7.Read Post | Comments (20)Dan Glickman, 10/23/12Dan Glickman is Vice President of the Aspen Institute and Senior Fellow at the Bipartisan Policy CenterWith 80 percent of the states effectively disenfranchised from the system, the essence of our participatory democracy is at stake.Read Post | Comments (55)Richard Bangs, 10/23/12Author, \u0027The Lost River\u0027Here at Iguaçu, fluid beauty and violence collide.Read Post | CommentsMike Lux, 10/23/12Partner, Democracy PartnersThe president fired up the Democratic troops last night. Now it is up to the troops to deliver. In the battleground states, we have to not only do the crucial mechanics of turning out the vote, we have to fire our people up and get them motivated.Read Post | Comments (13)Michael Giltz, 2012.23.10MC Hammer, 2012.23.10Carlos Alberto Torres, 2012.23.10Henry Gornbein, 2012.23.10Sophie-Alexandra Aiachi, 2012.23.10Doreen Clark, 2012.23.10Lea Black, 2012.23.10Turnstyle, 2012.23.10Paul Abrams, 2012.23.10Chrysovalantis P.
