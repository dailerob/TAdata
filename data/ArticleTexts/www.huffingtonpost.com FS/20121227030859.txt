{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor of Literature at YaleThe final twist of the anti-Chuck Hagel slanders, a real regression in the tenor of popular discussion, must also be blamed in some measure on President Obama. For it echoes his own turn from saying, in 2007, that the Iraq war made America less safe to his saying in 2010 that it made America safer. Words can indeed be important, if not quite to the extent or in quite the way the president fancies, and his timidity in declining to fight a smear campaign against a courageous public servant whose honor he placed on the line may yield a perspective from which to reinterpret a few of his favorite words. Reflection. Pivot. Dreams.Read Post | Comments (425)Jon Brod, 12/26/12Co-Founder \u0026 CEO, Patch; President of AOL VenturesStarting this week, Patch is partnering with Starbucks on its \"Come together\" initiative.

A survey by Consumer Reports found that 90 percent of Americans find at least one thing stressful about the holiday season (who are these 10 percent who feel no holiday stress?). Of course, it\u0027s possible that just having such expectations of the season to begin with, and then feeling the guilt at not meeting them, might be part of the problem. But whatever the reason, stress is what a lot of people will be unwrapping this year. Fortunately, much of it is returnable. So what follows are tips not only for holiday stress, but for the rest of the year as well. If you\u0027re in that 90 percent who\u0027s stressed out this week and next, this might be the list you should be checking twice. Your mind and body -- as well as your family -- will thank you.Read Post | Comments (55)Carl Sferrazza Anthony, 12/24/12First Ladies and Presidential Families Historian, Author \u0026 ScreenwriterNo matter how much we may imagine them now as marbleized icons of history, even presidents and first ladies enjoy searching out the ideal gifts to give loved ones at the holiday season, and sometime delight with an equal degree to receive them.Read Post | CommentsKevin McKiernan, 12/26/12Journalist, author, documentary filmmakerA few weeks ago, a U.S. diplomat disclosed that the U.S. had secretly offered Turkey a bin Laden-style assassination of the top leadership of a Kurdish rebel group.
