{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Adlai E. Stevenson IIIFmr. member, U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee; Chairman, Adlai Stevenson Center on DemocracyThe debate over the NSA\u0027s data collection should lead to a better balance between rights of privacy and requirements of foreign intelligence. But whatever the outcome of that debate, it has failed to acknowledge inherent deficiencies and risks in \"foreign intelligence\" and the transcendent role of foreign policy in the defense of our national interests. Our foreign policy failures and dilemmas reflect failures of a cerebral sort of intelligence, including a lack of experience in the real world away from Washington, its arm chair polemicists, its ideological think thanks, and too little experience in military ground forces where you learn to expect the unexpected. Policy has been driven by ideologues, militarists, and amateurs, including Members of Congress who are little noted nowadays for real world experience.CommentsKathleen AnnFreelance writer from New EnglandI\u0027m not a \"Never Had.\" I know what it\u0027s like to pay bills on time and have a little left over. I remember vacations and pedicures and going out to dinner. As a \"Used-to-Have,\" I know exactly what Corporate America, lobbyists and politicians have taken away from me.Comments (308)Jeffrey SachsDirector, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \"To Move the World: JFK\u0027s Quest for Peace\"The discretionary civilian budget -- the part that looks after your and your children\u0027s future other than social security, health, and emergency support -- is disappearing. What about America\u0027s future scientific and technological leadership? What about America\u0027s role in fighting climate change and promoting clean energy through new R\u0026D? Forget about it.Comments (35)Martha BurkMoney Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsWhile women have indeed come a long way in the Olympics since they were first allowed to compete in 1900, at times it\u0027s been a tough fight.CommentsJedediah PurdyProfessor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027If you share the values of civic equality and common care, they tie you to people working for them everywhere. That\u0027s true in a practical way: we here in North Carolina hope to reverse the gerrymandering that gives us a massively Republican congressional delegation in an evenly split state.CommentsPratap ChatterjeeAuthor, Halliburton\u0027s Army: How A Well-Connected Texas Oil Company Revolutionized the Way America Makes WarIt\u0027s increasingly clear that the online world is, for both government surveillance types and corporate sellers, a new Wild West where anything goes. This is especially true when it comes to spying on you and gathering every imaginable version of your \"data.\"CommentsDan LyonsMarketing fellow at HubSpot and creator of \u0027The Secret Diary of Steve Jobs\u0027I\u0027m hoping Microsoft\u0027s new CEO realizes how terrible these ads make the company look and will drop the whole thing. Instead of harping on Microsoft\u0027s competition, he should tout the virtues of its products. Be positive. Be upbeat. Start fresh.CommentsPaul SzepTwo-time Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonistCommentsSeth ShostakSenior Astronomer, SETI InstituteFaith is a personal matter, and should never be a cudgel to stifle inquiry. We tried that approach about 1,200 years ago. The experiment was called the Dark Ages.Comments (20)Kimberle CrenshawDistinguished Professor of Law, UCLA School of LawIn over 179 countries (and counting), women, men and children are coming together not only to raise awareness about violence, but to reclaim spaces where women ought to be safe but are not.CommentsBernard-Henri LévyFrench philosopher and writerIn this time of provocative and suggestive \"quenelles\" and bananas hurled at government officials, of rancid hatred and incendiary clamor, of generalized resentment and vindictive rivalries, we have forgotten a word that badly needs reinventing. That word is fraternity.CommentsPaul C. BrunsonProfessional Matchmaker, author, personal branding expertI have spent decades \"being educated\" -- in college, graduate school, numerous professional certifications, and now a Ph.D. program. But at no point in my life has there been a more profound education than my time working for Enver Yucel and Oprah Winfrey.CommentsRebecca JuroFreelance journalist, blogger and Internet radio talk show hostIn the end, if Piers Morgan is truly the trans supporter he says he is, then what he thinks really shouldn\u0027t matter. Simply the fact that Janet Mock and other trans women were offended should be enough for Piers Morgan to apologize, learn from his mistake, and promise not to repeat it.CommentsValerie JarrettSenior Advisor to the President and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsWoodson taught us that, \"those who have no record of what their forebears have accomplished lose the inspiration which comes from the teaching of biography and history.\"CommentsIra IsraelLos Angeles Psychotherapist \u0026 CounselorIf you want to have a radically mindful, loving, connective, passionate, intimate experience that may or may not include non-procreative sex, you may want to consider some of the following advice.CommentsSeporah RaizerCancer is not a competition. Oh, well, it is if you ask Official Pancreatic Action -- their latest ad campaign features a picture of a woman, with a bald head (presumably from chemo), and next to her is a quote, \"I wish I had breast cancer.\"CommentsScott ShigeokaDigital storytellerI scraped by living in Washington, D.C., one of the most expensive cities in America, for nearly eight months with no steady income. I kept telling myself, \"This is the city of opportunity. You can make this work.\"CommentsJane EisnerEditor, The Jewish Daily ForwardIf there is a practice common among a minority of New Yorkers that is proven to sometimes cause serious injury or even death to infants, wouldn\u0027t the new mayor want to curtail that practice?CommentsChristian PiattAuthor, editor, speakerWhenever I hear about someone else making a case for New Earth Creationism in the name of Christianity, I\u0027m embarrassed, once again, to associate myself with them. The media is responsible for its share of fanning these flames in the public forum, though.Comments (54)Sharda SekaranManaging Director of Communications, Drug Policy AllianceToo often, the people who use drugs are invisible or worse they are stigmatized and demonized as \"junkies,\" \"addicts,\" and \"criminals.\" Drug users are \"others\" to be held in stark contrast to the rest of \"us.\"Comments (32)Steven J. BramsProfessor of Politics, NYUThe problem of fairly dividing a divisible good, such as cake or land, between two people probably goes back to the dawn of civilization. But this problem pales in comparison to that of fairly dividing indivisible items, such as in a divorce or in the division of an estate between two heirs.CommentsKen AdelmanVice President, Movers and ShakespearesThe nice coincidence of Ronald Reagan\u0027s birthday and the opening of the Olympics reminds me of a wonderful story daughter Maureen Reagan told me in Reykjavik, Iceland. We were there in October 1996, on the tenth anniversary of the summit, which is the focus of my upcoming book Reagan at Reykjavik.CommentsAdam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911To hear Republicans talk, the real danger is that you might get too many notifications that your identity is at risk. Must be nice to be a senator, eh?CommentsAzeem IbrahimExecutive Chairman, The Scotland InstituteIt is an appalling travesty of so-called democracy in a country that once inspired the world when it threw off military dictatorship and allowed Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi to enter politics after so many years under house arrest.CommentsDr. Jill BidenSecond Lady of the United StatesBecause of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs\u0027 Caregiver Rule, Brett\u0027s employer kept his job open so Brett had the time to care for his brother. Now Brett\u0027s back at his job in Chicago, and Kyle is doing great. Like the brothers\u0027 situation illustrates, these support systems can have a significant impact on the day-to-day hardships caregivers face.CommentsAnn BrenoffSenior Writer, The Huffington PostDrug addiction isn\u0027t just about the pleasure of getting high. It is also the story of untreated depression and mental illness. Through his career, Hoffman battled doubts and depression.CommentsSen. Kirsten GillibrandU.S. Senator from New YorkIn far too many cases, unpaid leave means families must face the stark choice between a paycheck and caring for a loved one. This is not a choice any family should have to make.Comments (26)Shannon WhiteheadSustainable apparel consultant; Columnist for Ethical Fashion Forum; Co-founder of {r}evolution apparelWhile the slow food movement is starting to catch on and consumers are becoming increasingly more conscious of what they eat, we don\u0027t yet think of clothing in the same way.CommentsOtto ScharmerSenior Lecturer, MIT; Founding chair, Presencing InstituteWhy is it that, across so many major systems, we collectively create results that nobody wants? Nobody wants to increase environmental destruction, poverty, cultural ADHD, or suicide. Yet we keep doing it. Why do we collectively recreate these patterns?CommentsAlexis KleinmanThis might hurt your feelings, but I\u0027m just going to come out and say it: I don\u0027t care about your Facebook history.Comments (189)Jon SoltzCo-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranCoffman said: \"Certainly an advisory role, but certainly not anything beyond that. And that\u0027s if requested. I think we have to be very careful once out about reentering that particular conflict. I would say, in terms of regular troops on the ground, absolutely not.\" There are three points why, despite his moderate wording, Coffman is calling for yet another war.Comments (23)Anne Wallestad, 2014. 6.02Lauren Pecorino, Ph.D., 2014. 6.02Kathie Bergquist, 2014. 6.02Mary-Lou Stephens, 2014. 6.02Loren Kleinman, 2014. 6.02Rob Berger, 2014. 6.02Harold Bronson, 2014. 6.02Mitch Kellaway, 2014. 6.02Annie L.
