{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoOpponents of laws regulating the sale, manufacture and use of guns fervently invoke the Second Amendment. In their view, the Second Amendment (\"a well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed\") forbids the government to regulate guns. Period. End of discussion. But it is more complicated than that. At the outset, let\u0027s put aside the argument that the \"well-regulated militia\" clause signficantly narrows the scope of the Second Amendment. Although most judges and lawyers endorse that interpretation, the Supreme Court, in its controversial five-to-four decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, rejected that understanding of the text. So, let\u0027s consider that matter \"settled.\" Let\u0027s assume, then, that the Second Amendment reads: \"The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\" Now, that sure sounds absolute. But it\u0027s not that simple.Read Post | Comments (2,173)Dan Froomkin, 01/09/13Contributing editor, Nieman ReportsDo yourself a favor, and don\u0027t go see Zero Dark Thirty.

In a hardlined Republican crowd, that\u0027s rare. He\u0027s also acknowledged the man-made causes of the climate crisis. Good for him, but how screwy is it that we have to give credit to people who simply acknowledge scientific facts?Read Post | Comments (210)Kathleen Peddicord, 01/09/13Publisher, Live and Invest OverseasYou don\u0027t have to sell everything you own, say goodbye to everyone you\u0027ve ever known, and take off for a new life in some distant and exotic place, never to be heard from again.

Bernie Sanders, 01/09/13Independent U.S. Senator from VermontDespite such terminology as \"fiscal cliff\" and \"debt ceiling,\" the great debate taking place in Washington now has relatively little to do with financial issues.
