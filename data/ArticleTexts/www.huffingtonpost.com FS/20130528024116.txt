{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Just as markets over-built housing, mispriced mortgages and bid up prices beyond the real financial capacity of homebuyers, America\u0027s colleges and universities have over-expanded and over-priced their product. We are getting an education bubble with dynamics similar to the late housing bubble. As more and more students find themselves with debts that exceed the salaries offered by the current job market, colleges have expanded beyond the capacity of their markets. Some kind of shakeout is coming. The question is: what kind. Clearly, our society cannot afford the current rate of expansion of higher education costs. We\u0027ve reached the limits of piling these expenses onto students. But as resources become more scarce, as the consequences of over-expansion hit, the social risk is that the shoe will pinch even more intensely in the wrong places.Comments (562)Gary HartPresident, Hart International, Ltd.If you are locked into an ideology that government is bad, you have a stake in proving that to be the case. Whether a gridlock-committed Republican party will pay a price for opposing the will of the people remains to be seen. It\u0027s up to the American people to decide what they want.Comments (127)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027My modest suggestion that governments become the agents of their citizens in bargaining with global capital should hardly raise an eyebrow. But capitalist tools are acting worried that average citizens may be starting to see what\u0027s really going on.Comments (73)Karen MorganPlaintiff, \u0027McLaughlin v. Panetta\u0027I have a flag that I\u0027m technically not allowed to have: the flag that was draped over my wife\u0027s coffin at her funeral. It is military custom to present that flag to the spouse of a fallen soldier, but our marriage doesn\u0027t exist in the eyes of the government that she served for 17 years.Comments (236)Craig ConsidinePh.D. candidate, Trinity College Dublin; Film director, \u0027Journey into America\u0027; Interfaith activistUnder George Washington, several Muslim Americans served in the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War. Bampett Muhammad, for example, fought for the \"Virginia Line\" between 1775 and 1783.Comments (299)Dylan RatiganNew York Times Best-Selling author, entrepreneur and formerly the host of MSNBC\u0027s The Dylan Ratigan ShowToday we honor the veterans who have served our country. We reflect and pray for them, as well as celebrate their lives as they have given so much. We also share thoughts with those who are currently serving and those who will serve.CommentsSen. Bernie SandersIndependent U.S. Senator from VermontDenmark is a small, homogenous nation of about 5.5 million people. The U.S. is a melting pot of more than 315 million people. No question about it, Denmark and the United States are very different countries. Nonetheless, are there lessons that we can learn from Denmark?Comments (1,094)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThe only compelling reason to \"put on the brakes\" on Keystone would be if there was some hope of keeping the stuff in the ground. The fact that tar sands extraction releases \"significantly more carbon dioxide\" than the ordinary stuff won\u0027t do it. No one in power is saying \"keep it in the ground.\"CommentsMarty KaplanDirector, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolInformed Citizen Disorder: the damage you do to your mood and your blood pressure by watching Bill Moyers or Jon Stewart, listening to Kevin Phillips or Bruce Bartlett and reading the Guardian or the New York Times.Comments (38)Allison TateAuthor, mother of fourThank you for spending this year with my child, maybe the last year when I can really, truly call him a child, and for continuing to nurture his love of school.

GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersBy refusing to join other clothing retailers in a binding agreement to protect Bangladeshi workers, more than 1,200 of whom have died in factory fires and collapses in recent months, Gap is saying: You and I, we\u0027re not the same; I don\u0027t hear your voice or want to know your name.Comments (59)Brittney GrinerWNBA playerSince being drafted a little over a month ago by the Phoenix Mercury, life has certainly been a whirlwind. I\u0027ve been from the East coast to the West coast on media tours, have done countless interviews and met a lot of new people -- and I\u0027ve loved every minute of it.Comments (24)Jacob WoodPresident, Team RubiconOver the course of four years in the Marine Corps, two combat tours, nearly forty comrades killed in action, and eight dead by their own hand, I have heard \"Amazing Grace\" emotionally played on bagpipes too many times for a man who has only just turned thirty.Comments (16)John PavleyCTO @ The Huffington Post, BloggerI believe everyone should learn to code. The skill of coding is no different from the skill of reading and writing English or any human language. I hold myself up as an example: if an art major can learn to code and find success in technology land, why can\u0027t everyone do it?Comments (224)Jim DownsAssociate Professor of History and American Studies, Connecticut CollegeAs America recognizes the 150th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclaimation, we would do well to revisit the origins of Memorial Day among freedpeople in Charleston.Comments (13)Steven RaichlenGrilling Authority, www.barbecuebible.comToday is Memorial Day and if you\u0027re like most Americans, your celebration will culminate at the grill over a sizzling hamburger.

And this magical equilibrium must be preserved, one embellishing the other, making it sing the way a fine wine inspires a delicious dish. Who, then, will win the Palme d\u0027Or this year?CommentsChristopher HayesHost, \u0027All In with Chris Hayes\u0027Terrorism as a category has gotten massively stretched until it\u0027s almost lost its meaning in this day and age, but there\u0027s a real reason why it\u0027s a specific category.Comments (954)HuffPost RadioRon Reagan and Mary Matalin debate Obama\u0027s speech refuting Bush-Cheneyism on terrorism. Was it transformational or largely rhetorical? No more treating local thugs as UBL? And despite Noonan\u0027s \u0026 Will\u0027s best efforts to blur Obama \u0026 Nixon, 44 has the Teflon of 40.CommentsWray HerbertAuthor, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027It\u0027s been more than a decade since oxytocin was first heralded as the \"hormone of love\" -- a distinction that came with optimistic predictions for future drug therapies.

Not just for students, but for their families, and for past and future generations.
