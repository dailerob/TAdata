{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Fellow, the Cato InstitutePresident Barack Obama has become the fourth straight president to order military action in Iraq. His airstrikes have destroyed American military equipment captured from the U.S.-supplied Iraqi army, which a decade ago American forces defeated and disarmed. The last president who didn\u0027t bomb Iraq, Ronald Reagan, acted as a de facto ally of Baghdad in the latter\u0027s aggressive war against Iran, which ultimately encouraged Saddam Hussein to invade Kuwait. That in turn led to the first Gulf War, years of sanctions and periodic bombing, the 2003 invasion, and now the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Unless President Obama pulls back quickly, his administration risks becoming absorbed in another interminable, unnecessary war in Mesopotamia with unpredictable but almost certainly negative consequences.I don\u0027t think Governor Cuomo\u0027s refusal to debate Zephyr Teachout is really about sexism. It\u0027s about money-ism. In this democracy, not to have money is not to be qualified.Author, \u0027Republic, Lost\u0027; Founder, RootstrikersThe temple was huge and packed and silent and all her fancy friends were there, as well as many of us girl comics, because we had lost our dear leader (I do see her as my own personal Kim Jong Ill, as she was tiny yet commanded an empire) and so it was our saddest day.Comedian, actor and recording artistThe gap between the Democratic Party\u0027s deep-pocket Wall Street and corporate donors and the working families it claims to represent is now a chasm. A new economic populism has begun to build. And that means that campaigns like Teachout\u0027s are increasingly important.President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureThe New York Times Magazine has a long article about Eva Moskowitz and her chain of charter schools in New York City. But what Moskowitz does to get high test scores is not a model for public education or even for other charters.Research Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027In this season between anniversaries from Brown v. Board of Education to Freedom Summer to the Civil Rights Act, some pose an unsettling question. They ask if the NAACP is relevant. Though the question is wearisome not worrisome, it must be answered.President and CEO of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)Regardless of whether one agrees or disagrees with the views of the super-rich, this state of affairs is an unmitigated disaster for American democracy. Not only does it distort our electoral process, but it corrupts our elected officials and disillusions our citizens.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoI don\u0027t really even know how to tell you about Hyperemesis Gravidarum. In short, it\u0027s a bitchy version of morning sickness hell-bent on being an overachiever. A relentless case of the stomach flu.Writer, TheLeakyBoob.com, BeyondMoi.com, mom to 6 girlsUnless we reduce skyrocketing wealth and income inequality, unless we end the ability of the super-rich to buy elections, the United States will be well on its way toward becoming an oligarchic form of society where almost all power rests with the billionaire class.Independent U.S. Senator from VermontThis says a lot about the NFL, and us. Sure there was an outcry, but some weren\u0027t convinced that Rice had really done anything wrong. We had to see a video to realize what domestic violence really looks like.Political science professor, LaGrange College in GeorgiaIt\u0027s the car version of a million \"don\u0027t get raped\" products. Most solutions advocating segregation are variations of \"shrink it and pink it\" consumer product and public space design that suggest women have to take themselves out of spaces shared by men or risk the consequences.Feminist, writer, and satirist (not always in that order)The U.S. is trying to win a war for the hearts and minds of Africa. But a Pentagon investigation suggests that those mystery projects somewhere out there in Djibouti or Ethiopia or Kenya or here in Tanzania may well be orphaned, ill-planned, and undocumented failures-in-the-making.Managing Editor, TomDispatch.comFour years ago the Supreme Court decided corporations were people under the First Amendment, entitled to their own freedom of speech. Since then, Big Soda has poured a fortune into defeating ballot initiatives to tax or regulate sugared drinks.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027What it all boils down to is that we may not know which party controls the Senate when the votes are all in on election night. It may be days before anyone knows whether Democrats or Republicans will control the chamber.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comTrans women face higher rates of discrimination, violence, sexual assault, and poverty. Around half of all victims of anti-LGBTQIA homicides in 2012 were transgender, and all of them were women of color.President, National Organization for WomenEither we need to redefine what probable cause means and say that police are not subject to it, or we arrest officers right away just as we would with any other person accused of committing a crime.President, National Action NetworkWe relate to the world as much by image and symbol as by its tangible qualities. The more distant the reality, the greater the tendency to rely on myth and stereotype.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghAmerica\u0027s capitalists take every chance they get to remind us that they are our \"job creators,\" but it turns out that their least-favorite thing on earth to do is create jobs.Chief financial writer, The Huffington PostUntil recently, few people took seriously the possibility that Scotland might actually secede from the United Kingdom. However, with a referendum scheduled for September 18, the latest polls show secession in the lead for the first time, and gaining dramatic momentum.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027An expert on how Wall Street and the banking industry are destroying the middle class, Senator Warren has put that knowledge to powerful use on Capitol Hill, rapidly becoming the most authoritative and articulate voice of the Democratic Party\u0027s progressive wing. Many are urging her to run for president.Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyHistorians will look back at the period between 2000 and 2015 and wonder, with all that was happening, why didn\u0027t more people realize that clean energy and technology would become as much of a driving force for the global economy as dirty energy had been a century before?Executive Director, the Aspen Institute\u0027s Energy and Environment ProgramConsidering these risks and opportunities, Wikistrat evaluated four scenarios for charting Scotland\u0027s emergence as an independent country by the year 2020 -- if it gains independence within the next five years.The World’s 1st Crowdsourced ConsultancyI would like someone to explain to me why we need more research on the characteristics of gun violence to understand why 100,000 deaths and injuries from guns each year constitutes a risk to health.Mike the Gun GuyHow can we look into the eyes of these unemployed workers -- or ourselves in the mirror -- without acknowledging our failure to address this crisis? Don\u0027t we have a moral obligation to our fellow Americans who had nothing to with creating this ongoing jobs crisis?Leo Hindery, Jr. is co-chair of the Task Force on Jobs CreationMarch 20, 2009, 3:10am the phone rang. It was my parents ... both of them were on the line ... telling me something that even five years later I still can\u0027t understand, and barely believe. They told me that Jed, my brother, was dead.Board member, co-chair, and treasurer of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP), Utah ChapterThe nations opposed to ISIS are strange bedfellows -- the United States, its Arab allies, and NATO member Turkey as well as Iran and its ally Syria. Together, a coalition of these rivals would include almost all of the region\u0027s combat power, both Sunni and Shia nations. ISIS would be surrounded on every side. Yet such a coalition is unlikely to emerge.Research Fellow of the Royal United Services Institute in London, and a doctoral candidate at Harvard University\u0027s Department of GovernmentThat Rupert Murdoch governs over a criminal media empire has been made clear enough in the UK courts in recent years. That the Wall Street Journal op-ed pages, the latest victim of Murdoch\u0027s lawless greed, are little more than naked propaganda is perhaps less appreciated.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \"To Move the World: JFK\u0027s Quest for Peace\"Sometimes the simplest tweaks can completely reinvent something. In this case, the waffle iron came through. Smashing the tots into those crevices took them to a level of crispiness that I could never achieve in the oven, yet the insides stayed pillowy soft.Everything worth caring about in food, drink, and travelI was in my freshman year of high school when I realized just how painful it was to see myself in the mirror as I was: a 14-year-old girl on the brink of puberty. Speaking as a 17-year-old boy, it makes a lot of sense now -- my appearance struck conflict with my identity.Visual Arts Student \u0026 GLSEN AmbassadorGolf as \"green opium\" ... a dangerous import ... a gateway to further decadence.Chief content officer, Asia Society; author, The Forbidden Game: Golf and the Chinese DreamDemocrats\u0027 instinct seems to be to trumpet what\u0027s right about the economy instead. But that message won\u0027t resonate when economic conditions are so miserable for so many people -- especially the core voters which Democrats will need if they are to win in November.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"GOP PEP TALK",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
