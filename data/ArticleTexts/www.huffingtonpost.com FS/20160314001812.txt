{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week the GOP debate circus pulled into Miami, ahead of Tuesday\u0027s Florida primary. It might have been more civil in tone, but it was actually much more frightening than the brawls of previous debates. Gone was the extreme rudeness, but as a result the extreme policies were harder to miss. Asked about torture and targeting civilians, Trump said that while we \"have to obey the laws,\" we should simply \"expand those laws,\" presumably to legalize what\u0027s currently illegal. When asked if all 1.6 billion Muslims hate us, he calmly replied, \"a lot of them\" do. Meanwhile, Rubio\u0027s answer to climate change was that we can\u0027t \"change a law in Washington to change the weather!\" And all suggested that we need to once again send ground troops to the Mideast (what could possibly go wrong?). Finally, when asked about increasing violence at his rallies, Trump blamed it on his supporters\u0027 anger about trade deals. And just days later, his canceled rally in Chicago nearly turned into a full-scale riot. Making America great again, indeed. Some have compared this to a reality show. If only that were true. This is reality, and we\u0027re all losing.Earlier today, my friend Nancy Reagan joined her husband in their adjoining gravesites at the Reagan Library. United in death as they had been throughout their long and happy marriage, Nancy and Ronnie were two film actors who played out their lives on a much more exciting world stage than Hollywood.Actor, author of 10 books and a book of poems \"Life Could Be Verse” published by HCI, December 2014\"I hope that no one will ever tell a girl that there is something she can\u0027t do because she is a girl.\"Former First LadyToo many students don\u0027t have the classroom resources they need to realize their passions and unlock their potential. Students can\u0027t dream big when classrooms lack books, microscopes, and robotics kits -- or even paper, pencils, and paste.International Women\u0027s Day -- March 8 -- is one of my favorite days. It is a time to celebrate the impressive progress women at all levels of the career ladder have made in recent decades.Managing Director, IMFWhen I think of Hillary Clinton offering her eloquent ode yesterday to Nancy Reagan for the late first lady\u0027s supposed \"very effective, low key [AIDS] advocacy,\" I am absolutely furious and I don\u0027t know what to do with myself.Editorial Director, The Huffington Post VoicesWe can discern from Hamilton\u0027s owns words what he probably would have thought of Senate Republicans\u0027 vow not to consider any Supreme Court nomination President Obama puts forward for Justice Antonin Scalia\u0027s successor. The best guess, based on the historical evidence, is that Hamilton and other of the Constitution\u0027s Framers would have been appalled by the confirmation antics of McConnell \u0026 Co.Senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of LawSenior Counsel, Brennan Center for Justice Democracy ProgramDonald Trump has demeaned and sexually harassed women openly for years. These kinds of behaviors don\u0027t just end on their own nor has Trump suffered any consequences that might deter future sex offenses. Those two things combined almost guarantee that there are other victims.San Diego Mayor Bob Filner’s former female chief of staffIt isn\u0027t just about empowering women and girls because it\u0027s the right thing -- our vision of a poverty-free world depends on it.CEO, UnileverRepublicans\u0027 stance on Supreme Court nominees and their response to the extremists at the top of their party\u0027s ticket are the same issue. And the solution is simple. If Republican Senators want to stand up to extremists running for president, they can start by standing up to extremists in the Senate. They can start by doing their jobs.Democratic Senator from MassachusettsThe military has long prided itself on being a meritocracy, where those who serve are judged not based on who they are or where they come from, but rather what they have to offer to help defend this country. Today, we take yet another step toward that continued excellence.25th Secretary of the Department of DefenseTo be clear, the Reagans did not start a national conversation about HIV and AIDS. That distinction belongs to generations of brave lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people, along with straight allies, who started not just a conversation but a movement that continues to this day.Democratic candidate for President; Former Secretary of State, U. S. Senator and First LadyI\u0027m quite sure that it is a scientific fact that parents never feel like fully functional human beings again.Blogger, A Morning GrouchWe write to you as scholars of American history, politics, and the law. We express our dismay at the unprecedented breach of norms by the Senate majority in refusing to consider a nomination for the Supreme Court made by a president with 11 months to serve in the position.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoAs the news broke on March 7, 2016, that U.S. drone strikes had killed 150 people in Somalia, the White House announced it will reveal, for the first time, the number of people killed by drones and manned airstrikes \"outside areas of active hostilities\" since 2009. This is a critical first step toward much-needed transparency. But it will not go far enough.Professor, Thomas Jefferson School of LawSimply by using the Internet, you have no choice but to share large amounts of personal information with your broadband provider. You have a right to know what information is being collected. It\u0027s your data. How it\u0027s used and shared should be your choice.Chairman, Federal Communications CommissionWe cannot afford to elect a President with a history bad judgement, inconsistent positions, and who has used public service as a vehicle for private gain. In other words, we cannot afford the status-quo.Co-Founder, Ben \u0026 Jerry\u0027s Ice Cream and Head Stamper, StampStampede.orgVoters owe it to the citizens of Flint and kids everywhere to ask a different question this election cycle. Don\u0027t ask for less government -- instead, ask: how do we make sure government works for the citizens who need it the most?global strategic advisor, speaker, NYU Lecturer, and author, Mission ControlWhile Trump is legitimately terrifying, I would argue that the rise of outside politicians like Trump and Sanders may ultimately be a good thing for our country. Maybe these aren\u0027t end times after all. Maybe it\u0027s a beginning.Democratic candidate for U.S. Representative of North Carolina\u0027s 2nd Congressional DistrictAfter two years, I\u0027m changing my last name back to Olson from LaFave. No, this isn\u0027t a story about divorce. I\u0027m still happily married and building a company together with my husband.

It has been unreal, distressing and nauseating. One of the main thoughts that remains in my head is, What if I didn\u0027t have my camera? Thank God I did.Music producer and musicianIn an election cycle when the media can and does shape how we choose our next president, the fact we have fewer and fewer sources to look to for credible information regarding those who are running is frightening. And it\u0027s only getting worse.Rhetorical scholar. Writer. HuffPo, Thought Catalog, Feministing, Academe and others. Professor. Feminist. Progressive.Trump must be denounced immediately by people of faith In America and around the world for saying something so hateful, bigoted, and dangerous. To conflate 1.6 billion people around the world with violent religious extremism is absolutely irresponsible.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersMuch as I\u0027m reluctant to further any infighting within the transgender and gender nonconforming community, I also have a responsibility to speak truth to power. Your visibility has gone from mildly annoying, to problematic, to atrocious, to outright detrimental, and so I ask you, politely: Stop trying to help though the media and public appearances.Trans* and GenderQueer-identified psychotherapist in the NYC area working with sexual/gender minority populations. www.LauraAJacobs.comI\u0027ve been reluctant to use the \"f\" word to describe Donald Trump because it\u0027s especially harsh, and it\u0027s too often used carelessly. But Donald Trump has finally reached a point where parallels between his presidential campaign and the fascists of the first half of the 20th century are too evident to overlook.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027Team Hillary wants to sound tough on corporate bad actors, while providing tax breaks to most of the private sector.
