{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Howard FinemanEditorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupLet\u0027s hear a round of applause for the Founding Fathers, those dead white men whom conservatives love to lionize. Had it not been for the founders, there would be no relief from the spectacle of a U.S. Congress bound and gagged by the National Rifle Association and the Gun Owners of America. More than two centuries ago, the founders assembled a system of government as complex, but elegant, as an 18th-century clock: a Newtonian mechanism of political wheels, gears and weights driven and regulated by distributed power. They created a commander in chief and a national military, but left the \"police power\" where it always had been: with the states.Comments (574)Mike RyanSenior Entertainment Writer, The Huffington PostNo one has successfully launched a film-review television series since Siskel \u0026 Ebert. I think that\u0027s because all who have tried have made the audience feel stupid in one of two ways -- either by being too knowledgable, in a way that\u0027s alienating, or by being not knowledgable enough, in a way that makes you think, Why am I watching this?Comments (15)Bob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowThe only jobs being creating in Rep. Tim Griffin\u0027s district are for cleanup crews to mop up the damage from the dirty fuel he continues to endorse. But I\u0027m sure the Republican voters in Faulkner County will figure out some justification for continuing to support the Keystone XL pipeline\u0027s biggest fanboy in Arkansas.Comments (118)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activist\"Stories can conquer fear,\" Nigerian novelist Ben Okri once said. \"They can make the heart bigger.\" There\u0027s a world of truth to that statement. As someone who comes from a long line of storytellers, I\u0027ve always said that our lives are just long and rich stories, knit together over the years, that tell us not only about ourselves, but the human condition, as well.CommentsDeepak ChopraCo-author, \u0027Super Brain: Unleashing the Explosive Power of Your Mind to Maximize Health, Happiness, and Spiritual Well-Being\u0027; founder, The Chopra FoundationWith India\u0027s vast population, there are trillions of interactions per year. If they swing too far to the negative, the society\u0027s soul is suffering a malaise.CommentsDr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarAs more and more women in the workplace compete with each other for jobs, they\u0027re calling on gossip as a means to get ahead--or keep others down.Comments (145)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Democrats invented Social Security and have been protecting it for almost 80 years. They shouldn\u0027t be leading the charge against it.Comments (158)Gavin ShulmanWriter, ProducerForget fullboob. That\u0027s so flagrant. So in your face. Even the description \"full frontal\" sounds so crude. Wholeboob is a concerted effort, with lights and Photoshop, posing and makeup, planning and care -- sideboob is a sneak attack.Comments (38)Maureen RyanTV critic, The Huffington PostWe felt connected to him because he was so deeply and profoundly connected to what he loved.CommentsKristin Kirkpatrick, M.S., R.D., L.D.Manager of Wellness Nutrition Services at Cleveland Clinic Wellness InstituteDue to its worldwide popularity, coffee is probably the greatest source of antioxidants in the global diet. And while having lots of it isn\u0027t recommended for everyone, for some of us, it may just be the superfood of the century. Here are nine reasons to start the day with this healing drink.Comments (85)Ban Ki-moonSecretary-General, United NationsOn April 5th, the world will reach a vital moment in history\u0027s largest and most successful anti-poverty push -- the 1,000-day mark before the target date to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.CommentsAdam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; founder of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911Some credit mistakes aren\u0027t so obvious. What\u0027s worse, the biggest secret credit mistake -- the one most people don\u0027t even know they\u0027re making -- actually happens when people are trying to turn their credit score around and be more financially responsible.Comments (38)Susan RosenzweigAdvertising creative and personal essay writer\"What if sleeping with some guy is squashing his motivation to go out and find the true love of his life because his immediate sexual needs are being met? Meanwhile, some other girl is doing the same with the guy you\u0027re supposed to be with.\"Comments (60)Amber DusickAuthor and Illustrator: Parenting, Illustrated with Crappy PicturesSo now I\u0027m a parent. People have long compared parenting to having a job. You hear quotes all the time like \"the hardest job you\u0027ll ever love\" and stuff like that. Well you know what? Parenting isn\u0027t just hard.Comments (381)Meg Waite ClaytonBestselling Novelist, \u0027The Wednesday Sisters\u0027 and \u0027The Wednesday Daughters\u0027Goodbye, Mr. Ebert. My two thumbs are way, way up for the film education you gave me, and the hours of enjoyment you steered me toward. You will be missed.CommentsJeff DanzigerPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideComments (54)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThe empirically established fact that minimum wages don\u0027t hurt the people who get it isn\u0027t the same as showing that they help them. So why do we need a minimum wage and why would abolishing it be so harmful?Comments (44)Erica HillCo-Anchor, NBC News’ Weekend TODAYReclaiming my sleep made me realize how much I was giving up when I let the exhaustion win, and how much there is to gain in letting go and listening to my body. I\u0027ve finally awakened to the world around me and all it was trying to offer.Comments (19)David ZuckerProducer/Writer, \u0027Scary Movie V,\u0027 the latest installment of the Scary Movie franchiseAfter having shot movies in Hollywood, Vancouver, London, and Santa Clarita, Scary Movie V my first shoot in Atlanta, and I was eager to experience a new city.CommentsTony Ingraffea and Mark RuffaloDestroying the land to provide a few years of toxic, temporary jobs and further entrench our nation\u0027s dependency on fossil fuel is not a good bargain for New York or for Illinois -- or for any other state proposed for wringing out the last puddles and whiffs of gas and oil.Comments (116)James FrancoActor and authorThis week I went to see The Place Beyond the Pines. I loved the whole film and was engaged every moment of the way. But what I want to talk about is the first section, the Gosling section; I want to make love to this section.Comments (39)Brynn Gelbard and Lavi SolowayLesbian and gay binational couples remain shut out of green cards and fiancé(e) visas. As a result, LGBT families are still torn apart, forced into exile or left fighting to remain together in this country. None of them feel that we have already won, and to say that is an insult to their struggle.Comments (11)Tina WellsFounder, Buzz Marketing GroupComing together around a table is an important part of my life. I\u0027m a part of the Global Mom Relay today, so other families around the world have the chance to share good food and conversation together.CommentsNikki MullerWriter, comedienneIf I had married a Princeton man as an undergrad, by now I would have divorced one. Getting married before you\u0027re ready just because there\u0027s a nice selection is like overstuffing yourself at the buffet just because the food is there.Comments (60)Frances BeineckePresident, Natural Resources Defense CouncilPeople are starting to realize that if we change the way we eat, we can change the way the food system works. We can grow food that is good for our health, good for our communities, and good for the planet. The winners of the Growing Green Awards are showing us how.Comments (12)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027We would take the time to sound out each syllable, word, and sentence until they got it right, \"With malice toward none, with charity for all ...\" While they were learning to read, I wanted them to absorb the words of Lincoln.CommentsKayla WilliamsAuthor, Truman National Security Project FellowServing in the military taught me a number of skills that have been essential to my success since I reentered the civilian world.CommentsRobert L. BorosagePresident, Institute for America\u0027s FutureThe rising American electorate is sinking together in this economy. The faltering jobless recovery isn\u0027t working for most working families. Over 20 million are still in need of full-time work. Wages and family income are falling.Comments (446)Jamison DoranYouth advocate and nature lover living in Washington, D.C.Friends in D.C. often greet me with, \"What the hell is going on down in your home state?\" I\u0027m getting awfully tired of trying to defend the state as a whole by writing those in the legislature in Raleigh off as ideologues. It is getting harder and harder to do so.Comments (83)Karl A. Pillemer, Ph.D.Professor of Human Development, Cornell University; Author, \"30 Lessons for Living: Tried and True Advice from the Wisest Americans\"Why is excessive worry such a big regret? Because, according to the elders, worry wastes your very limited and precious lifetime. By poisoning the present moment, they told me, you lose days, months, or years that you can never recover.Comments (42)Arianna Huffington\"Our life together can be better.\" That\u0027s the opening sentence of an important new book by Jim Wallis called On God\u0027s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn\u0027t Learned About Serving the Common Good. Wallis wrote it while taking a three-month sabbatical last year, in the midst of the 2012 election -- a break that allowed him to get a broader perspective on what was going on in American public life.Comments (201)Blake Landau, 2013. 4.04Norman Solomon, 2013. 4.04Sarah Barness, 2013. 4.04Kerry and Kelly MacLean, 2013. 4.04Brad Friedman and Desi Doyen, 2013. 4.04Erica Firpo, 2013. 4.04Glenda Corwin, 2013. 4.04Jay Brown, 2013. 4.04Natasha Ashton, 2013. 4.04Brittney Figueira, 2013. 4.04Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"????",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
