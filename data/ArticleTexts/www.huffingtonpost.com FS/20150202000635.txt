{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Today, the nation finally gets to stop talking about deflated balls and finally gets around to... watching some very expensive TV commercials. Of course, the Super Bowl is much bigger than touchdowns, field goals or celebratory crotch grabs; it\u0027s about the joy of a frequently divided country sharing a common experience -- deciding whether you prefer beer ads with or without cute animals. Meanwhile, that new reality show Desperate Leaders of the Western Hemisphere took a dramatic turn with Speaker Boehner claiming he told Israeli Ambassador Ron Dermer not to tell President Obama about Prime Minister Netanhayu\u0027s planned speech to Congress. It\u0027s like high school -- if the stakes were, instead of a ruined prom, nuclear war. And on Friday, Mitt Romney let some of the air out of the 2016 GOP race with his announcement that he wouldn\u0027t be assembling the old team one last time after all. It was Deflategate for the top one percent. Go Seahawks... or Patriots!America\u0027s resurgence is real. With a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, and booming energy production, we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth. Now we have to choose what we want that future to look like. Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well?44th President of the United StatesWhy speak out about Bill Cosby now? The simple answer is that it\u0027s the right thing to do. The truth deserves to be known. As I write this, more than 20 women have come forward, many with stories that are remarkably similar to mine.Philanthropist and former entertainment executiveThe concern with campus sexual assault has begun to take on the characteristics of a panic in which government officials and school administrators have increasingly lost sight of other fundamental values that must shape the culture of institutions of higher learning.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoThe near-global stagnation witnessed in 2014 is man-made. It is the result of politics and policies in several major economies -- politics and policies that choked off demand. In the absence of demand, investment and jobs will fail to materialize. It is that simple.Professor at Columbia University and a Nobel Laureate in EconomicsWhat Rodriguez is confronting us with is a raw and very unpleasant image of the Valley that\u0027s applauded for creating the world\u0027s most progressive companies when, in fact, some women are calling it a place stuck in the 1950s.CoFounder and President of PowerToFly.comA year after the launch of The WorldPost, the hunger for an expanded global conversation is stronger than ever. Wherever we are in the world, we\u0027re living in a golden age of engagement for news consumers. And as the media landscape has evolved, The WorldPost has evolved along with it, while staying true to our DNA of combining the best of traditional journalism with the best of an open media and new technologies.Chairman, Berggruen InstituteAs the minority-majority population becomes more of a reality, Hollywood has to go through a metamorphosis. I would guess that most smart executives know this and are looking for the kinds of partnerships that will keep them relevant. We must seize this opportunity and break down the tough walls of segregation in Hollywood.Founder, GlobalGrind.comThe internal political situation is highly polarized between political forces playing with fear and insecurity and others capitalizing on anger and despair. This inflates extreme right and left populism. Much irresponsible and opportunistic rhetoric abounds. This polarization is squeezing out moderate left of center forces that historically have been fundamental in promoting democracy and reforms in Greece.Former Prime Minister of GreeceI am disheartened by the decision made by Senator John Cornyn, the incoming Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Human Rights, to remove \"Civil Rights\" and \"Human Rights\" from the name of the Subcommittee.Chief Executive Officer, The King CenterThe mass media have suddenly discovered Jeffrey Sterling -- after his conviction Monday afternoon as a CIA whistleblower. At age 47, he is facing a very long prison sentence. As a whistleblower, he has done a lot for us.Author, \u0027War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death\u0027It\u0027s hard to believe some senators are still complaining about these cases, claiming the government should instead send them to military commissions at Guantanamo Bay. Meanwhile, due in large part to those complaints, the five alleged September 11 co-conspirators remain stuck in lengthy pretrial hearings at Guantanamo.Senior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstAs Obama and his team muddle toward their finish line, their achievements negligible, we might even express a modicum of gratitude. When they depart the scene, we will forget the lot of them. Yet at least they managed to steer clear of truly epic disasters.Author, \u0027The Limits of Power: The End of American Exceptionalism\u0027There is no place any longer, either in the NFL or the nation at large, for the injustices and hypocrisies of prohibitionist marijuana policies. It\u0027s time for the NFL to be a leader and create a rational and science-based marijuana policy.Retired 11-year NFL veteran, Super Bowl XXXIII championRetired NFL Super Bowl XLVII Champion; Fox Sports analystRetired 11-year NFL veteran and Super Bowl XLIV championSince my \u0027Anjou Trilogy\u0027 takes place at the French court in the first half of the 15th century, I thought I would try and describe what you might see, were you a fly on the wall.Author and Historian; author of the acclaimed Anjou Trilogy and frequent lecturer and historical writer.If the invitation was aimed to extract a better deal from Iran and protect our friend and ally Israel, then the speaker miscalculated, for it will do the opposite. If the invitation was aimed at scoring political points by undermining the administration, it\u0027s deeply troubling that the speaker is willing to undercut diplomacy in exchange for theatrics on the House floor.U.S. Representative from OregonIt\u0027s time for GrubHub to join other companies that have already banned shark fin products, like Disney, Amazon, Hilton, Marriott and the Starwood hotel group, and take action to protect sharks before it\u0027s too late.ActressCEO, OceanaSome Davos participants described the atmosphere this year as \"gloomy\" and \"fearful.\" Those who control the world seemed to feel, and be, out of control and unsure how to deal with growing and frightening global instabilities and the violence that keeps emerging.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersThe systematic iteration of the word \"thug\" in reference to black bodies is problematic because it perpetuates white supremacist ideologies about black people, namely that we are pathological, violent and lawless.Senior at UNCPeople across ideologies want our education system to work for America\u0027s children -- and that goes for many of National School Choice Week\u0027s backers as well as its critics. But let\u0027s not allow those whose real goal is the destruction of public education to cloak their agenda under the cheerful banner of \"school choice.\"President, People For the American WayThe math is pretty simple: In the end, what social media dating does is give users -- and, most poignantly -- women more options. And more options means more freedom, and more power, too.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarThe Washington team\u0027s inappropriate response is unfortunately consistent with the \"playbook\" that the Washington team and NFL continues to use to defend the offensive and harmful team name and logo of the Washington team.Clinical psychologist in Manhattan and member of the Medical Advisory Board at EHE InternationalI arrogantly assumed that my lack of a criminal record and the small amount of clean time I had accumulated would exonerate me and I would leave with a slap on the wrist. I was sentenced to 12 months in jail, five years probation, more than $3,000 in restitution and 100 hours of community service.Recovering addict, Blogger at ErinsInsideJob.com, freelancer, fitness enthusiastMuch like NAFTA, the TPP has more to do with big-business protectionism than with genuine free trade. Most of the chapters seek to limit the regulatory powers of governments. Most damaging of all, the TPP would create new incentives for corporations to ship jobs overseas and would forbid governments from using strategies like \"Buy American\" provisions.Dean of the US House of Representatives | Ranking Member, House Judiciary CommitteeYou think you\u0027ll remember every key moment of your kids\u0027 lives -- but you won\u0027t. Oddly enough, I can recall the theme song from \u0027Gilligan\u0027s Island\u0027 but I find it nearly impossible to draw out of cold storage a memory of my oldest kid\u0027s first bike ride.Senior Editor, HuffPost 50The New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks will play in the Super Bowl this Sunday in Glendale, Arizona. It\u0027ll be a great game, and there are probably enough story lines and subplots to fill a 160-page Quentin Tarantino script.@ryanhatchThe adhan can help us recall what gives our lives meaning, and can help us cultivate an attitude of gratefulness. It can help us look up from the cellphone in our hand and notice the blue sky, the purple shadows stretching across the snow or the smiles of those we pass by.Researcher at Georgetown\u0027s Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding; Former Fulbright Fellow in Amman, JordanIt would be surprising if any member of the Supreme Court would take the King v. Burwell petitioners\u0027 wholly unsubstantiated assertions about former Sen. Ben Nelson\u0027s critical role in the passage of the Affordable Care Act at face value, particularly in light of his direct and explicit contradiction of those assertions.Founder and President, Constitutional Accountability CenterOne of the best parts of the day is tucking in to a king\u0027s ransom worth of food.pickledplum.comOn the initiative of the Bibliothèque National de France, the review La Règle du Jeu, and two young philosophers, Joseph Cohen and Raphaël Zagury-Orly, a major symposium was held last week on the subject of Heidegger and \"the Jews.\" Over the discussions hung the appearance of Heidegger\u0027s famous \"Black Notebooks,\" in which his anti-Semitism shows its face plainly.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.We all have a horror story about being late -- arriving at a wedding just as the bride and groom are running off in a shower of birdseed or picking up your panicked child at an otherwise empty field after baseball practice. You\u0027re not alone. So before you\u0027re late for your next very important date, consider these six tips for being right on time.Host of the award-winning Savvy Psychologist podcast and real-life clinical psychologistGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"TOSS-UP!",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
