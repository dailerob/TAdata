President, Writers Guild of America, East.Congressman John K. Delaney, what are you talking about? In a recent Washington Post op-ed, headlined, \"The last thing America needs? A left-wing version of the Tea Party,\" the Democratic congressman from Maryland scolds progressives and expresses his worry \"about where some of the loudest voices in the room could take the Democratic Party.\" But the progressive agenda isn\u0027t \"left wing.\" The progressive agenda is America\u0027s story -- from ending slavery to ending segregation to establishing a woman\u0027s right to vote to Social Security, the right to organize, and the fight for fair pay and against income inequality. Strip those from our history and you might as well contract America out to the US Chamber of Commerce the National Association of Manufacturers, and Karl Rove, Inc.Our zeal in excoriating modern-day Marie Antoinettes reveals an insidious, widespread, and totally accepted form of misogyny -- one that masquerades as engaged cultural critique while rehearsing and repeating the very same sexist salvos most enlightened men and women have long banished from their vocabularies.Author of \u0027Primates of Park Avenue\u0027At a time of historic economic inequality, it should be a no-brainer to raise a tax on inherited wealth for the very rich. Yet there\u0027s a move among some members of Congress to abolish it altogether.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027What makes a park a park? Ordinarily, that might be a question for a New York dinner party. Today, it is an urgent legal question before the New York Court of Appeals. As a Villager, I\u0027m naturally concerned that any of our local parks could be wiped out to make way for more construction. Overall, our city is park-starved.Oscar-nominated actor, climate change activistCaitlyn knows who Jesus is, and Jesus knows her by name. Whether that sits comfortably on a timeline or blog comment, I know firsthand that Caitlyn has heard the good news.Pastor of Community and Worship at Resonate.You can find his music at www.reverentworship.netAs an introvert, you can slip an Introji into a text message, and suddenly you don\u0027t have to explain to your friend or significant other that you need time alone or want to leave the party now, because the icon says it all.An online publication and community for introverts and highly sensitive peopleLongstanding systems of public service provision in areas ranging from transport to broadcasting to utilities look likely to be come under new scrutiny under the TiSA.Associate Professor of Law, Yale Law SchoolYear after year, President Obama provided waivers to sidestep the 2008 Child Soldiers Prevention Act, by which Congress prohibited the U.S. from providing military assistance to governments filling out their ranks with children.Managing Editor, TomDispatch.comThe sport that hundreds of millions of people are so passionate about mobilizes political and economic forces. No doubt it deserves a more transparent, clean and effective governance structure. However, these efforts will not take place on neutral ground, but in the midst of fierce competition for power and international influence.Political scientist, professor, Department of International Relations of the State University of Rio de JaneiroWhile I\u0027m encouraged that my recommendations are a part of President Obama\u0027s recent executive order on this issue, including banning the free transfer of certain military-grade equipment and imposing strict oversight and transparency measures, we cannot stop advocating for comprehensive reform.U.S. Representative for Georgia\u0027s 4th DistrictI don\u0027t feel the ultimate rush of happiness when someone wants to know all about this baby I hold my breath for. I often just feel like crying. I don\u0027t know how to tell them our story without having to face their fears, too. You are my worst nightmare, their eyes tell me. I know.There\u0027s no wrong way to be a woman.The GOP isn\u0027t openly presenting itself as the \"anti-elderly party.\" But how else are we to interpret its deeds and actions? Its leading presidential candidates are pushing cuts to Social Security, while its congressional budgets would end Medicare as we know it.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourWalker was an ALEC member as a state legislator in the 1990s, and the agenda that Walker has championed throughout his long political career has closely tracked the policies promoted by ALEC and its corporate funders, despite public opposition to many of those measures. If Walker is successful in his presidential bid, he would be the first ALEC alum to take the oval office.The Center for Media and Democracy/ALEC ExposedCaitlyn Jenner could have, as the professional she is, presented herself in a manner that did not slide in so smoothly with the routine sexual objectification of the American woman, and that opens her, and by extension the rest of us, to the claim that she\u0027s playing out an erotic fantasy.Executive Director, Gender Rights MarylandEx-lobbyist Tom Wheeler\u0027s courage in battling deep-pocketed corporations on competition, open Internet, privacy, the digital divide, and robocalls transformed him in my mind from oligarch apologist to American Avenger. That\u0027s why I\u0027m so bummed he won\u0027t use his superpowers to fight the super PACs.USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorIn fact, being content with being single can be seen as a sign of emotional maturity. Being a mature, autonomous person before making a commitment to a partner is a worthwhile goal.Licensed Clinical Social Worker and College InstructorThis would be an historic moment for any country, but it is even more so for this bastion of conservative Catholicism. So how did Ireland, one of the last Western democracies to decriminalize homosexuality, become the first country to embrace marriage equality by popular vote? Five factors shaped the outcome.VP at GQRThis is a striking example of how big media like the New York Times can try to enforce their own limits on debate by asserting without evidence that certain ideas and therefore the people who espouse them are not mainstream.Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicyYes, by all means, let\u0027s talk about inequality of opportunity for our kids because that\u0027s where it all starts. But let\u0027s also remember that those kids grow up, and when they do, it doesn\u0027t get easier. The scars of childhood last a lifetime.Lecturer in the College of Business and Economics at California State University, Los AngelesThe claims that Hani Muhammad Mujahid makes cannot be verified. What he said about his time as a foot soldier for al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and Waziristan \"tracks\" with what a former director of counter-terrorism for the CIA knew at the time. But no one can confirm the claim itself. But neither can they ignore it.Editor, Middle East EyeYesterday, someone on a work conference call called me Jessica.

SeekingIncrease.comI have said that the central issue for the 2016 presidential contest is the restoration and protection of voting rights. It is therefore fitting that Hillary Rodham Clinton, the leading contender for the Democratic Party\u0027s nomination for president in 2016, made voting rights the centerpiece of a speech at a major campaign stop in Houston today.Diversity Visiting Professor, University of San Francisco; and Scholar Writer in Residence, MLK, Jr. Institute, Stanford UniversityWhether data compromises give rise to breaking news stories or pounding headaches, anything less than a zero-tolerance attitude toward identity-related crimes won\u0027t get us to the place we need to be.Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911The sun rises over Compton Avenue and lights up the buildings that make up the Nickerson Gardens Housing Project.

It helps to ensure that technological innovation enriches the few and sustains jobless economic growth. Industrial policy in the hands of the government ideally creates wealth and spreads it around. Venture capitalists pick a handful of winners as part of a process of concentrating wealth in fewer and fewer hands.Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogThis isn\u0027t to say that she\u0027s any worse than other Republicans; it\u0027s merely to note that, like with Obama, her calling herself a \u0027Democrat\u0027 doesn\u0027t make any difference, other than to fool a different group of suckers.Investigative historianTo anyone who has lost a child, you may have felt you lost everything the day your baby died.
