{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, I used my vast storehouse of football knowledge (i.e., almost none) to correctly predict that the Giants would beat the Patriots in Super Bowl XLVI. I did not, however, predict that supermodel Gisele Bundchen would make headlines with her expletive-laden tirade blaming hubby Tom Brady\u0027s teammates for the loss. I also failed to predict the Catholic Bishops\u0027 forcing the president into overtime in Birth Control Bowl MMXII, or Rick Santorum\u0027s trifecta on Tuesday night (is it time to officially downgrade Romney from inevitable GOP nominee to evitable GOP nominee?). Elsewhere, President Obama abandoned his previous denunciation of outside money (in the wake of the Citizens United ruling he had called super PACs a \"threat to our democracy\") and joined the super PAC parade -- a decision his campaign defended as a necessary evil, but which many viewed as just another example of this White House\u0027s willingness to waver. Even on \"threats to our democracy.\"Read Post | Comments (14)Mohamed A. El-Erian, 2/10/12CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOFor the sake of both current and future generations, let us hope that Clint Eastwood\u0027s \"Half Time in America\" commercial will be remembered for more than just igniting yet another round of political bickering and finger pointing.Read Post | Comments (314)Valerie Jarrett, 2/6/12Senior Advisor and Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Affairs and Public EngagementRight now, if you\u0027re a woman in the workforce, it can be surprisingly difficult to answer basic questions about equal pay: what\u0027s the typical salary for someone in your position? Should you be asking for more at the negotiating table? What are your fundamental legal rights?Read Post | Comments (173)Trita Parsi, 2/10/12President, National Iranian American CouncilIt is lack of political courage that has permitted this looming confrontation. Only courage and will can bring us out of it. The question is whether Obama can muster that will in an election year when any compromise is bound to be cast by Republicans as a betrayal of Israel.Read Post | Comments (991)Arianna Huffington, 2/7/12The recent reversal by the Komen foundation of its decision to no longer fund grants to Planned Parenthood is a case study in how radically social media have changed the way institutions relate to those they purport to serve.Read Post | Comments (226)Jim Messina, 2/6/12Obama for America Campaign ManagerThe campaign has decided to do what we can, consistent with the law, to support Priorities USA in its effort to counter the weight of the GOP Super PAC.Read Post | Comments (661)Marlo Thomas, 2/7/12Award-winning actress, author, and activistIt\u0027s not every day that the federal government issues a postage stamp with your dad\u0027s picture on it. But our dad was not your every day kind of guy. On February 16, the U.S. Postal Service will officially release the new Danny Thomas stamp.Read Post | Comments (114)Dylan Ratigan and Eliot Spitzer, 2/10/12We need to look at our banking and housing system and engage in a ruthless yet compassionate evaluation of whether it is working to solve our national needs. Serious thinkers in both parties recognize that it isn\u0027t.Read Post | Comments (509)Rita Wilson, 2/10/12Editor at Large, Huff/Post50; Actor and ProducerWhat\u0027s the secret to long-lasting relationships? It seems your answers were close to what my answers would be: Laughter, kindness, respect, allowing the other to grow, hanging in there when it gets rough, not walking away. And great sex.Read Post | Comments (158)Gary Hart, 2/8/12President, Hart International, Ltd.Instead of endlessly and ineffectively interviewing the Santorums of the world, wouldn\u0027t it be interesting if just one of the Sunday morning talk programs rounded up George W. Bush and his cohorts to hold them accountable for the monumental act of folly that is still unfolding in Iraq?Read Post | Comments (167)Julianne Moore, 2/3/12ActressThis year, in this election, I am committing to watching even more vigilantly. I truly can\u0027t imagine a more important election for us to make our voices heard.Read Post | Comments (401)Norman Lear, 2/11/12Founder, People for the American WayI had a dream last night. Mitt Romney had won the Republican nomination and the race for the presidency was on. The super PACs on behalf of Mitt coughed up their millions for starters -- and the attack ads began everywhere.Read Post | Comments (44)Robert Redford, 2/8/12Actor, director, and environmental activistThe Keystone XL pipeline doesn\u0027t deliver on jobs or national security, it jeopardizes public health and safety and the president was right to reject it.Read Post | Comments (631)Barbara Becker, 2/8/12Founder, EqualShot; Faculty, Columbia UniversityWhile walking with my 8-year-old son near our home in Manhattan, he spotted a purple swastika scrawled across a billboard advertisement. As I took in the complexities of the situation, my son uttered words that made my heart break.Read Post | Comments (1,038)David Cameron, 2/6/12Prime Minister of Great BritainOver the past 18 months we\u0027ve put a massive amount of effort and investment into strengthening apprenticeships in this country - and it shows. Last year more than 450,000 people started an apprenticeship, roughly the same number as those who started in higher education.Read Post | Comments (94)Marian Wright Edelman, 2/10/12President, Children\u0027s Defense FundLast year more Americans relied on food stamps to eat than at any time since the program began in 1939 -- 46 million. Yet once again some voices are starting to wonder whether we really need robust anti-hunger programs in America.Read Post | Comments (170)Jon Soltz, 2/10/12Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranOur troops are professional and do their jobs -- men and women, alike. Does Rick Santorum think we\u0027re not?Read Post | Comments (692)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 2/6/12Author, \u0027Our Fathers Ourselves. Daughters, Fathers, And The Changing American Family\u0027The Planned Parenthood flap will come and go in a couple of news cycles -- instructive, but ultimately harmless. But if the gains for women in the Affordable Care Act go down with the ship, it may take decades to get them back, if we can get them back at all.Read Post | Comments (328)Michael Moore, 2/11/12Oscar and Emmy-winning directorOn this day 25 years ago, in 1987, I became a filmmaker. I had no idea on that morning in Flint, Mich. what my life would be like after that, or what would happen to Flint, or to General Motors.Read Post | Comments (263)Christy Turlington Burns, 2/10/12Founder, Every Mother Counts, Director/Producer, NO WOMAN, NO CRY, global maternal health advocate, mom, modelWhen was the last time your cell phone saved your life? In the world\u0027s poorest countries, this happens every day.Read Post | Comments (19)Bill Moyers and Michael Winship, 2/6/12And now, a word about a good American being demonized, despite being long dead. Saul Alinsky is not around to defend himself, but that hasn\u0027t kept Newt Gingrich from using his name to whip up the froth and frenzy of his followers.Read Post | Comments (777)Lee Woodruff, 2/6/12Co-Author, \u0027In an Instant\u0027For any of you who have struggled to realize a dream or long held the notion that there is a finite time line for what you want to accomplish, hang on a tick. I am here to say that anything, really, is possible.Read Post | Comments (31)Bill Gates, 2/10/12Co-chair of the Bill \u0026 Melinda Gates FoundationI go to India at least once a year to see the progress of the work our foundation is doing there and I\u0027m always struck by two things -- the dynamism of the place, and the tremendous need. Unfortunately, the former doesn\u0027t cancel the latter out.Read Post | Comments (157)Kerry Kennedy, 2/9/12President, Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human RightsIf we support the human and civil rights of our LGBTI citizens in the United States, we must also vigorously advocate against the passage of this bill and act to stop state-sanctioned homophobia from taking root in any country.Read Post | Comments (163)Marcus Samuelsson, 2/9/12Chef and authorWhile my wife Maya and I enjoy eating out at times and trying new restaurants, to me the ultimate romantic dinner is the home-cooked one.Read Post | Comments (14)Chris Mooney, 2/8/12Author, \u0027The Republican War on Science\u0027 and \u0027The Republican Brain\u0027From global warming denial to claims about \"death panels\" to baseless fears about inflation, it often seems there are so many factually wrong claims on the political right that those who make them live in a different reality. Maybe they actually do.Read Post | Comments (2,255)Josie Feria, 2012.12.02Karin Kasdin, 2012.12.02Reverend William E.
