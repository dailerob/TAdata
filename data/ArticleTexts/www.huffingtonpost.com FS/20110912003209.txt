{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Today, an entire nation remembers. And reflects. Be sure to check out our ongoing liveblog, with links to all of HuffPost\u0027s 9/11 coverage -- including Andrea Stone and John Rudolf on continuing national security vulnerabilities, and Tom Zeller and Lynne Peeples on the environmental impact of the attacks -- as well as links to the best 9/11 stories from around the web. We are also featuring a truly remarkable collection of pieces from our Patch network. We asked each of our 999 Patch editors to identify someone in their town whose life had been altered by 9/11 -- or something that had been forever changed. The stories are as moving as they are varied, including a Midwestern firehouse chaplain who was on a truck heading to New York as soon as the towers fell; a pilot who left the cockpit to run for office after 9/11; and the school where the youngest passenger on Flight 93 had been enrolled. Please check them out -- and add your own memories to the conversation.Read Post | Comments (32)Michael Smerconish, 9/11/11Radio hostHere is a permanent memorial to the heroes of Flight 93 and a tribute to the victims of 9/11. It is a site where unparalleled tragedy has been converted into hope and healing -- and a place whose sacredness must be experienced in person.Read Post | CommentsDavid Bromwich, 9/10/11Professor of Literature at YaleA decade later 9/11 has become the name of a path as much as the name of an occurrence. Until we search out the tributary paths that led to the catastrophe, we will not begin to master the other courses to which it might lead.Read Post | Comments (191)Willie Nelson, 9/10/11Singer/Songwriter, President of Farm AidI remember playing at Farm Aid\u0027s annual concert, a few weeks after 9/11. We were determined to send a message of hope.Read Post | Comments (161)Hillary Clinton, 9/10/11U.S. Secretary of StateThis September, what will you do to remember? Will you take time to maybe help paint a school, or plant a tree, or tutor a child? Wherever you are from you can demonstrate the common humanity that binds us together and makes our societies and our world stronger.Read Post | Comments (263)Alec Baldwin, 9/8/11ActorAs unimaginable and cowardly as the 9/11 attacks were, it\u0027s important to ask ourselves what we must learn from them. Not just about terrorism, but about our country and ourselves as well.Read Post | Comments (541)Gary Hart, 9/10/11Teacher, author, and lecturerIt haunts me to my grave that prior to 9/11 I should have pounded on the doors of editorial writers and presidents demanding that they take the warnings of terrorist attacks seriously. Unlike the first responders, I cannot say that I did my duty.Read Post | Comments (40)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 9/10/11Author, \u0027Our Fathers Ourselves. Daughters, Fathers, And The Changing American Family\u0027A decade after 9/11, I\u0027ve been thinking a lot about heroes. I think about the ones that should have been, but ultimately couldn\u0027t carry the weight of the moment. I think about the ones we\u0027ll never know, or even know about, but should be able to recite by name.Read Post | CommentsPaul Rieckhoff, 9/11/11Founder of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of AmericaPart of Never Forget is Moving Forward. We honor the fallen that way, whether they fell in the towers, at the Pentagon, Shanksville, or on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan. And if you\u0027re not sure how, or not sure you\u0027re ready, find a veteran and ask him or her to help.Read Post | CommentsTalat Hamdani, 9/10/11After 9/11, America embarked on a path of revenge and vendetta, shedding the blood of thousands of innocent Afghans and Iraqis. Our gallant troops died avenging my son\u0027s death and the deaths of every precious soul we lost on 9/11. Who benefited? What did we gain?Read Post | Comments (71)Warren Rudman and Gary Hart, 9/10/11In 1999 we warned that terrorists \"will acquire weapons of mass destruction... and some will use them. Americans will likely die on American soil, possibly in large numbers.\" Tragically, few in government or the media paid attention.Read Post | Comments (22)Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, 9/10/11U.S. Senator from New YorkToday, as we commemorate the tenth anniversary of the atrocity of 9/11, we must continue to stand by our first responders and provide them with the tools and resources they need to handle a major national emergency and save lives.Read Post | CommentsDavid Wild, 9/10/11TV Writer; Contributing Editor, Rolling Stone; Author, \u0027He Is... I Say\u0027Ten years after 9/11, my wife and I still have no better explanation to offer our sons -- now 12 and 14 -- for what on earth happened that day than the poetic one that Stevie Wonder somehow understood a quarter century before those twin towers fell.Read Post | Comments (58)Raina Wallens, 9/10/11WriterEvery magazine and paper and news show seems to want to define the post-9/11 decade, but for those of us who lost our spouses, children, parents, and siblings, there is no defining or encapsulating.Read Post | CommentsRuth Bettelheim, Ph.D. and James A. Nathan, 9/10/11Failure to understand or act on intelligence goes a long way toward explaining the attacks of September 11, 2001. On this 10th anniversary of those events, we seem, once again, not to grasp the import of the information being provided by our intelligence.Read Post | CommentsMarlo Thomas, 9/9/11Award-winning actress, author and activistThis week, I had the privilege of sitting down with three remarkable young women who all had parents who died in the north tower of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.

They have protected industry from regulation and successfully attacked the very idea of the public -- public education, employees, unions, parks, housing, and safety nets.Read Post | Comments (257)Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, 9/11/11Rabbi and writerIn commemorating the 9/11 tragedy we dare not practice a submissive, counterfeit faith that assumes our own sinfulness and G-d\u0027s righteousness. We did nothing to earn this.Read Post | Comments (112)Huffington Post, 9/8/11From survivor stories to taking on religious, political and global ramifications, here is our collection of the very best opinion, analysis and heartfelt expression from our valued contributors.Read Post | Comments (21)John Scripsick, 9/10/11My son joined after \u0027Mission Accomplished\u0027 in Iraq, but was killed in Iraq in September 2007.
