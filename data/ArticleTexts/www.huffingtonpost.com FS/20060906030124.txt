{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"APAPFrom azgop.orgFrom huffingtonpost.comToday HuffPost is launching a new feature section devoted to promoting fearlessness in all aspects of our lives. Using as its springboard the themes in my new book, On Becoming Fearless, the section contains blog posts, news stories, and special features on relationships, work, parenting, health, sex, food, entertainment...in other words, life. This is the most personal book I\u0027ve written, and as its release takes me on a national tour over the next two months I\u0027ll be highlighting the many ways the personal intersects with the political. Because the more we learn to overcome the fears that limit us and to live in fearlessness, the more we\u0027ll be able to counter the dark forces -- both political and cultural -- looking to keep us shrouded in a fog of fear. Click here to check out the new section.READ POST | comments (53)09.05.2006 Gary HartVoters rarely listen to policies and programs from parties whose principles and ideals are indistinct, vague, and amorphous.READ POST | comments09.05.2006 T.

Get rid of the phrase \"trends indicating deterioration.\" I can write like that too.READ POST | comments (20)09.05.2006 Erin Kotecki VestI\u0027m learning from today\u0027s Washington Post that I\u0027m a \"Mortgage Mom\" and this year\u0027s \"Security Mom\" or \"Soccer Mom.\" You need me to win your district.READ POST | comments09.05.2006 Rep. John MurthaIf we are to fight this war with the same sense of dedication and vigor as we did prior wars, we cannot do it without a surge in force.READ POST | comments (179)09.05.2006 Caroline WeberIn an age when brave, independent thinking is in short supply both on and off the runway, a resurgent \"Marie Antoinette moment\" can only be a salutary trend -- whatever kind of dress that moment prescribes.READ POST | comments09.05.2006 Dan WorthIf all Americans just followed my lead...they would collectively add a baffling 75 million tons of CO2 to the atmosphere each week, or 3.2 billion tons per year! Not so hot, Mr. Tree Hugger.READ POST | comments09.05.2006 Bob GeigerWhile it\u0027s possible for the other side to win these seats, there\u0027s slightly more than two months until election day and a lot of ground would have to be made up very quickly.READ POST | comments09.05.2006 Jessica ValentiConservatives can\u0027t seem to make up their mind when it comes to feminism--is it dangerous or dead? Apparently it\u0027s both.READ POST | comments (67)09.05.2006 David SirotaNo, I\u0027m sorry folks - we are not going to suddenly have a progressive government if the Democratic Party suddenly won Congress and then the presidency.READ POST | comments (29)Jesse LavaRaymond J.
