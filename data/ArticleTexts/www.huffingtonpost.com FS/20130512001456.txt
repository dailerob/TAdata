{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundThis Mother’s Day, Nardyne Jefferies is one of the Children’s Defense Fund’s “Faces of Courage.” They are part of a club no mother ever wants to join. Most, like Nardyne, have lost children to gun violence. Nardyne’s beautiful daughter Brishell was only 16 when she was killed by bullets from an AK-47 in a drive-by shooting. Others have had spouses or other family members killed or injured by guns or been victims of gun violence themselves and have struggled to help their families deal with the trauma gun violence leaves behind. The campaign is focused on honoring gun violence victims and their families -- and taking action so fewer mothers who are celebrating Mother’s Day this weekend will be mourning their own children next year and in years to come.Comments (255)Cameron RussellModel, director, editorWomen are often worried about how they look and that\u0027s not superficial. We know that our appearance has nothing to do with how smart, creative, or hardworking we are, but it plays powerfully into what society decides we are worth.Comments (352)Al GoreChairman, Generation Investment Management and The Climate Reality ProjectYesterday, for the first time in human history, concentrations of carbon dioxide, the primary global warming pollutant, hit 400 parts per million in our planet\u0027s atmosphere. Now, more than ever before, we are reaping the consequences of our recklessness.Comments (893)Bianca BoskerExecutive Tech Editor, The Huffington PostIn taking stock of Home\u0027s flop, most have ignored the fact that we already have Facebook phones: They\u0027re our iPhones. (Or really any other smartphone with a Facebook app)Comments (79)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarSo much of the advice geared towards women who choose to go back to work focuses on how they can learn to accept the sacrifices that go along with working while raising children. I\u0027d argue that in many cases, going back to work is not a sacrifice at all but the best decision a woman can make not only for herself, but also for her family.Comments (28)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistOur house was always ?lled with music -- from the moment we woke up. And whenever she threw a dinner party, you could be sure that at some point, Nat Cole or Sammy Cahn would be at the piano, accompanying Frank Sinatra or Sammy Davis or Sophie Tucker.Comments (19)Diana Butler BassAuthor, \"Christianity After Religion: The End of Church and the Birth of a New Spiritual Awakening\"Although I\u0027ve never seen it on a pastel flowered greeting card, Mother\u0027s Day honors a progressive feminist, inclusive, non-violent vision for world communityCommentsArianna HuffingtonIn this week\u0027s issue, Saki Knafo looks at the plight of America\u0027s working poor through the eyes of one young man struggling to build a career in the fast food industry. And since this week marked the launch of our newest international edition in Japan, we\u0027re featuring photos from our tour of the gardens, temples and shrines of Kyoto.Comments (75)Allen FrancesProfessor Emeritus, Duke UniversityThe flat out rejection of DSM-5 by National Institute of Mental Health is a sad moment for mental health and an unsafe one for our patients. The APA and NIMH are both letting us down, failing to be safe custodians for the mental health needs of our country.Comments (95)Cate EdwardsFounding Partner, Edwards and Eubanks, LLC and President, Elizabeth Edwards FoundationEvery person has a timeline of their own life, made up of the big moments in it -- the personal bests and worsts that singe their memories. On my timeline, one of those worsts came on November 3, 2004, when my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer.CommentsJames ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Make no mistake about it, Syria has become a proxy war, but neither the Americans nor the Russians are calling the shots. More significant roles are being played by competing regional groupings who are supporting, and even driving, their Syrian allies.CommentsMaureen RyanTV critic, The Huffington PostWe should find out today whether Community has been canceled. I hope it is. It gives me no pleasure to say that. But it\u0027s time for some real talk about holding on to things that should be allowed to die.Comments (77)Aisling CarrollInstead of coaching athletes, she has spent the last several years coaching me as I\u0027ve strived to get better, first from ovarian cancer at the age of 32, then from the autonomic nerve damage the life-saving chemo caused.CommentsJessica AshleyWriter at SassafrassI have officially held the title of single parent for twice the amount of time I was a married mom. It has not been easy. Or simple. Or all bliss. But I love the family I\u0027ve made, the home we\u0027ve created and the kind of mother I am always becoming.CommentsMuhammad YunusNobel Peace Prize winner and founder of Grameen BankBoth the national and the international businesses should feel as though the workers are a part of their family. The days of slave labor have to come to an end. It is better to start the process now, before more ugly incidents occur.Comments (37)Colleen MullaneyLifestyle expertA Sunday Punch looks pretty, tastes divine and serves a crowd.CommentsLaura DoyleBest-selling Author, Radio Host, Relationship ExpertHere are the three most common, unhelpful pieces of relationship advice along with what I now know are more productive alternatives.Comments (45)Mike RyanSenior Entertainment Writer, The Huffington PostI hate the last episode of Seinfeld. This is an admittedly odd way to open up an essay that is primarily about Friends. I also realize this isn\u0027t a particularly unique or notable sentence to write considering that most people who have seen the last episode of Seinfeld share this opinion.Comments (305)Tammy BleckWitty Woman WritingOur life, for the years that we are raising our kids, revolve around them. It\u0027s just the way it is. But, as every empty nester knows, all things come to an end. All things except motherhood.CommentsChristy Turlington BurnsFounder, Every Mother Counts, Director/Producer, NO WOMAN, NO CRY, global maternal health advocate, mom, modelSince our inception, Mother\u0027s Day has been our biggest attention-grabbing, awareness-building opportunity to rally the troops and engage new audiences to join our efforts to make pregnancy and childbirth safe for all moms.CommentsKim ForenFloristIf breakfast in bed is not your ideal gift, here are two unique DIY projects that will wow the special women in your life.CommentsDonna HighfillWriter, Coach, Humorist, and Change ConsultantFad beauty can be everything from Rubenesque voluptuousness to elongated necks. It can include tattooed eyelids or lotus feet. What is overlooked is that fad beauty is often created by masochists who establish control over others by making them believe that they are never enough.Comments (24)Luis Ruuska17-year old senior from TennesseeBliss expressed his frustration with his teacher for \"teaching\" by giving out packets instead of engaging with her students. But is Jeff Bliss a hero for standing up for his beliefs, or did he overstep his boundaries big-time?Comments (49)Bill SchneiderDistinguished Senior Fellow and Resident Scholar at Third WayThe deficit is going down. Woo-hoo! Let the celebrations begin. Oh, wait. That may not be altogether a good thing. Certainly not for Republicans. They need an out-of-control deficit to bludgeon Democrats into cutting more spending.Comments (33)Annise ParkerMayor of Houston, TXThough Kathy and I have been building a life together for 22 years, we cannot marry in our home state -- the state where I was born, and where I serve in Houston\u0027s highest office. Texas, like 40 other states, does not allow same-sex couples to marry.Comments (45)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorThere\u0027s little to debate about the enormous impact our commercial culture has had on our planet. But there is much to debate about how our culture of excess consumerism and materialism can be transitioned into one of more efficient restraint and responsibility.Comments (66)Arianna Huffington\"I have experienced failure as a politician,\" Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe once said. In his second round as the country\u0027s prime minister, he is determined to avoid the mistakes of the past -- beginning with how to deal with the stagnant Japanese economy.Comments (424)Mike HoganExecutive Arts and Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post Media Group\"You look around this room and ask, \u0027What binds the people in this room together?\u0027\" New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said at Casa Lever on Park Avenue Thursday night. \"It\u0027s that they\u0027re all creators, they\u0027re all doers.\"CommentsBob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowThe Benghazi attacks (the consulate and the CIA compound) are absolutely not unprecedented even though they\u0027re being treated that way by Republicans. So we\u0027re left to conclude the obvious. The investigations and accusations and conspiracy theories are entirely motivated by politics.Comments (4,933)Joan LundenAuthor, TV personalityAs both a caregiver to my 94-year-old mom, Gladyce, and a mother of seven, Mother\u0027s Day is a holiday that I cherish with my family. It\u0027s a time to reflect on the lessons we\u0027ve learned from mom, and the way those teachings have shaped who we are and how we instill values in our own families.CommentsJim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027We would take the time to sound out each syllable, word, and sentence until they got it right, \"With malice toward none, with charity for all ...\" While they were learning to read, I wanted them to absorb the words of Lincoln.Comments (92)Joseph A.
