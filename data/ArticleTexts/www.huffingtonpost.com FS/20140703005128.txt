{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027On Monday the Supreme Court struck down a key part of the Affordable Care Act, ruling that privately-owned corporations don\u0027t have to offer their employees contraceptive coverage that conflicts with the corporate owners\u0027 religious beliefs. The owners of Hobby Lobby, the plaintiffs in the case, were always free to practice their religion. The Court bestowed religious freedom on their corporation as well -- a leap of logic as absurd as giving corporations freedom of speech. Corporations aren\u0027t people. The deeper problem is the Court\u0027s obliviousness to the growing imbalance of economic power between corporations and real people. By giving companies the right to not offer employees contraceptive services otherwise mandated by law, the Court ignored the rights of employees to receive those services.What we discovered is that people feel better and perform better and more sustainably when four basic needs are met: renewal (physical); value (emotional), focus (mental) and purpose (spiritual).President of The Energy Project; Author of Be Excellent at Anything: The Four Keys to Transforming the Way We Work and LiveWe are living in an era when the very idea of public education is under attack, as are teachers\u0027 unions and the teaching profession. In the past, Democrats supported unions, which they saw as a dependable and significant part of their base. This is no longer the case.Research Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027The 2-degree limit is the last guardrail for a safe global climate. If temperatures shoot beyond 2 degrees, it\u0027s quite possible that natural feedbacks -- melting ice sheets, drying rainforests, release of greenhouse gases from the melting tundra -- could carry the world to runaway climate change.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \"To Move the World: JFK\u0027s Quest for Peace\"Bringing a Glock into Starbucks doesn\u0027t make you a freedom fighter.

Here it goes.Writer, Netflix enthusiast and pug momThe ultimate folly is the belief that people are infinitely malleable, that Americans have been anointed to shape and mold humanity against its will, and that there is nothing which cannot be achieved through a few bombing runs, an occasional invasion, and a thorough military occupation.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteThis month California is celebrating the 10th anniversary of its first-in-the-nation Paid Family Leave (PFL) program, which has helped more than 1.5 million parents. But despite the track record, too few parents are taking advantage of the program, and those parents who may need it most are least likely to sign up.Award-winning journalist, bestselling author and activistListener bias results in most people thinking that women are hogging the floor when men are actually dominating.Feminist, Writer, Satirist... not always in that orderMost commitments in life come with an escape clause. You can join a group and later decide to leave. You can accept a job and then quit. Deep friendships can slowly fade -- even marriages. But to be asked by someone to participate in the act of creating a child... this was truly sacred.Artist, activist, community organizer, writer and Creative Director, PigeonHat IndustriesFor the first time in history, we face the possibility of destroying the prospects for decent existence -- and not in the distant future. For this reason alone, it is imperative to sweep away the ideological clouds and face honestly and realistically the question of how policy decisions are made, and what we can do to alter them before it is too late.Institute Professor emeritus, MIT Department of Linguistics and PhilosophyA hundred years ago, child birth was risky and infant mortality rates were horrific. How would you feel if 30 percent of infants died? Or if 900 expectant mothers out of every 100,000 died giving birth? But thanks to technology, the reality today is far different.Chairman/CEO, XPRIZEWhen our last child left home, I was sure that we would now have all the time in the world to spend with friends. Instead, it has been busier than ever and the idea that we, and all of our friends, would be lounging poolside sipping margaritas was really just a fantasy.Senior Editor, HuffPost 50When the George W. Bush administration commenced its global sales pitch to invade Iraq in 2002, misplaced fear and overly rosy projections for its success helped make it happen. If only they had heeded the prescient warnings of these nine individuals.Canadian writer and bloggerTo win the future, we should be providing incentives to encourage our youths to pursue professional careers that are suffering from labor shortages, instead of making education more costly and taxing for them.Representative from the 13th Congressional District in New YorkDo people, regardless of their own race and religion and age, have favored (and disfavored) groups that they do not publicly -- or consciously -- proclaim?Author, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027As the revolving door spins faster than ever between jobs in government and corporate America, information and who you know are the currency that gets you through the tollgate, information that paying clients then use for ever greater profits and a competitive edge.Senior writer, Moyers \u0026 Company on public TV. Senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.No, Hobby Lobby, that quote on your website is NOT from Thomas Jefferson! And, furthermore, the document it comes from -- which was written by James Madison -- is a list of some of the best arguments AGAINST that Supreme Court ruling that you and your fellow Christian supremacists are currently gloating about.Senior Research Director, Military Religious Freedom Foundation; Author, \u0027Liars For Jesus\u0027The public debate about the future of Iraq has locked on two options -- partition along confessional-ethnic lines or a unity government. Both proposals have problems.Professor of international relations, George Washington UniversityThis past week, to absolutely no fanfare whatever, the last declared chemical weapons left Syria. (Isn\u0027t it interesting how the drums of war earn endless media coverage, but the dove of peace flies unnoticed?)U.S. Congressman for Florida\u0027s 9th DistrictJeb Bush claimed, \"I\u0027m a skeptic. I\u0027m not a scientist.\" This mentality is a fundamental misunderstanding of how a representative democracy works. As elected officials, we aren\u0027t expected to be experts on every issue. However, we are responsible for making decisions based on the best available information.Author, \u0027For the Next Generation\u0027; Chair, Democratic National CommitteeThe series of events that led to the creation of an ISIS state has led to a flurry of pundits and policy makers spewing three common myths about Iraq. Attributing the current crisis to any of these misconceptions not only ignores the history of the region, but has resulted in flawed policy proposals, particularly from Washington.Co-author, Iraq’s Armed Forces: An Analytical HistoryAs we reach the halfway mark of 2014, the world\u0027s oldest democracy still struggles with the basic notion that the United States was founded, developed and enhanced by immigrants, owing much of its success to the hard work and sacrifice of the generations that came before us.U.S. representative from Florida\u0027s 26th congressional districtScience fiction is becoming science reality. Many of the technologies that we saw in Star Trek are beginning to materialize, and ours may actually be better than Starfleet\u0027s.

Kershaw is the only pitcher in MLB history to be unbeaten with that many wins, that many strikeouts, and an ERA that low in a single calendar month.Director of Content at Tradesports.com, Editor of TradesportsInsider.comI own a marketing company. I\u0027m Jewish. My partner is Italian and Christian. Of our almost fifty employees, our cultural and religious make-up is quite diverse. We are a company of people.

So what\u0027s our religion?Political and Pop Culture AnalystThe revised proposed settlement of the class action lawsuit against the NFL remains fundamentally flawed. The settlement neither recognizes nor compensates the majority of players who suffer the long-term consequences of repeated concussive injury.Attorney and Professorial Lecturer in Law at The George Washington University Law SchoolAttorney and Professorial Lecturer in Law at The George Washington University Law SchoolIt is no longer the case that the lowest common denominator is the only segment of the population that gets what they want. ESPN can attest to this; the U.S.-Germany tilt had more viewers watching on streaming media than the Super Bowl.Student, Tufts UniversityHelping is now big business. Human rights groups have become big industries with big salaries.
