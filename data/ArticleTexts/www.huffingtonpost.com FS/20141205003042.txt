{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Director, ACLU National Office\u0027s Racial Justice ProgramThis time seemed different because of the existence of a videotape that clearly showed the grotesque use of what turned out to be deadly force by a group of police officers the size of which would have been appropriate for the investigation of a serious, deadly offense rather than the most minor of nuisances. Surely, in the face of the shocking video, no grand jury could decline to initiate a criminal proceeding during which all of the facts could be explored and presented. But those hopes turned out to be unrealistic. This time the clear testimony of what was seen and recorded, along with the truth itself, lost out. We are all left wondering what will have to happen before there is accountability and an honest recognition of the enormous problem we face as a country, as the bitter taste of despair fills our mouths.I didn\u0027t cry. But a part of me died. When I heard the news about Eric Garner, my casual \u0027faith\u0027 in America died -- and I am thankful for its death.Executive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostThe reflexive community antagonism of the Giuliani years has given way to a much more subtle way of denying justice to the street. Rather than immediately demonizing the victims, Bill Bratton said there would be retraining in the wake of Eric Garner\u0027s death, and he almost said \"our bad,\" on Akai Gurley, publicly emphasizing his innocence.New York based criminal defense, civil rights, and employees’ lawyerI have come to the understanding that in many ways, looking up has been a convenient distraction from looking around. It allows me to opt out of facing the darkness here on Earth.Science Communicator, Engineer, and Space Policy AnalystIt\u0027s past time to fix it, and the church must stand alongside a new generation of young leaders and help the nation find the way forward.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersOur nation is cracking wide open on the fault line of race. In order to repair what is broken, we need each other. We need to heal, to connect, and to be the change.Senior Minister, Middle Collegiate ChurchWith the same predictability and inevitability of a House vote to abolish Obamacare, Bill O\u0027Reilly yet again has declared his false war on the faux war on Christmas.Scientist and former White House Senior Policy Analyst; Ph.D. in marine biology/neurophysiologyI took this trip because of a perpetual heartache I felt, a lack of connectivity with myself and with the world. I needed to step out of my comfort zone and decided to do that halfway across the world. And there is where I found a tribe of individuals who felt exactly the same way.Blog Editor, The Huffington PostCall the system of racial inequality in the United States what you will: the \"two nations\" of black and white, the new Jim Crow, or just plain ugly. But if the term \"apartheid\" shames the establishment into acting -- and prompts pundits to utter the word \"race\" when discussing inequality -- then by all means let\u0027s use the unflattering comparison.Director, Foreign Policy In FocusThe \"Did you smoke?\" question is offensive, of course, because it implies that the person deserves their cancer more than other types of cancer patients and thus merits less support or inferior medical care.Writer, \"Every Breath I Take\"; Fitness instructorAt a public meeting I recently attended, a woman stood up and asked me a question that gave me some pause: Why do the Arabs hate us so much? On its surface, hers was a simple, straightforward question. But when you stop to really think about it, the question is rather complex.Director, Center on Congress at Indiana UniversityIt\u0027s curious that four crucial aspects of war, American-style, were missing from the blitz of Hagel reportage. Here\u0027s a rundown.Editor, TomDispatch.comRace matters. It shapes our stories -- innocuous ones that unfold on front porches, harrowing ones that end in funerals and protests. Prejudice runs in all directions. But power, in the US, in 2014, notwithstanding a twice-elected African-American president, is held disproportionately in hands that look like mine.WriterThe top military commanders in the Pentagon have argued that reforming the military justice system as proposed would undermine good order and discipline. This is exactly the same argument that was originally made to oppose ending \"don\u0027t ask don\u0027t tell.\"President, Protect Our DefendersThere\u0027s no feigned shock. No forced surprise or mild disappointment. Just thick air. Deafening silence. And the weight of generations of false hope of equality sitting on my chest, on my shoulders, preventing me from breathing.PR and Communications Expert and curator of RadicalNewU™ dot comThe party\u0027s leadership has pinned its electoral hopes on demographic shifts and the cultural shifts that have brought issues like marriage equality to the fore. But the \"rising American electorate\" is also sinking, along with many other Americans, into an economic quagmire.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourNetanyahu\u0027s insistence on passing a bill that will define Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people is as disgraceful as his denial that Israel is not an occupying power. If the bill were to pass now or in the future, it would blow up what\u0027s left of Israel\u0027s democracy and destroy rather than save the Jews\u0027 last haven for which they have yearned for centuries.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUViolence is far too often not just a subtext, but the text in American society. No place in our society has remained untouched. Not suburbia. Not the halls of higher education. However, American violence proves all the more weighty when it is unjustly enacted by those who carry a firearm and a badge.Award-Winning Author of Freestyle: Reflections on Faith, Family, Justice, and Pop Culture; Founding Pastor of Joy Tabernacle A.M.E. Church in Dallas, TexasAs voters we must be careful about believing the rhetoric of anybody who stands to gain or profit on the backs of our children. Each of us is responsible for developing a better understanding of why we support or oppose major reform initiatives such as the Common Core State Standards.Assistant Professor of Social Studies, University of Arkansas; Blogger, EduSanityWhether their actions are based on something as simple as political DNA or a plot to retaliate against the president by taking hostages and wiping out villages, Congress, led by the GOP, is working hard to hurt the very people who elected them and helping the ones who got them elected.Richard Zombeck is a freelance writer for hire living in the Boston area and hangs out at www.zombeckink.comMy relationship and those interactions with Grandma led me to believe that people with authority are mean, and no matter what you do, you cannot please them. In other words, no matter what, I was wrong. It\u0027s one thing when what you do is wrong. Often, that can be corrected. However, when who you are is wrong, it\u0027s an entirely different story. When who you are is seen as wrong, there is an assumption and presumption of guilt that covers not just who you are, but also everything you do. You feel it and others perceive it, whether they acknowledge it or not.Spiritual Life Coach, NY Times Best-Selling AuthorWhile much of the protests revolving around Ferguson and Staten Island now revolve around race, there is an even more troubling dynamic and that is the perversion of the legal system in both instances to trust itself.Attorney, Former Prosecutor, Legal CommentatorWhen my husband and I started a family, I assumed that my babies would hand me a one-way ticket to holiday bliss. I couldn\u0027t wait to introduce them to all of the little traditions that I remembered from my childhood.Therapist, mother of two rowdy boys and co-blogger at Baby Proofed Parents, \"where sane meets baby brain.\"The media\u0027s \"comeback\" double standard seems to reflect the misguided Beltway consensus that America\u0027s a center-right country, so of course it was only a matter of time before Bush regained his footing (he didn\u0027t) and that Obama would likely fade away during his second term (he hasn\u0027t).Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaFewer and fewer Americans, including many middle-class Americans, believe that they can even preserve their existing standard of living -- or that their children will do any better. But how accurate are these perceptions?Author, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027\"Black lives matter.\" \"I can\u0027t breath.\" These are the words that have been chanted by protestors from New York to California. Demonstrations continue nationwide against the deaths of young black men at the hands of police officers.Hofstra Journalism ProfessorCurrently in India there are so many arts and literary festivals, the joke goes, that they outnumber the participants. But the bestselling historian William Dalrymple advanced an important belief to me in Goa. He referenced the almost timeless kavi sammelans -- a gathering of poets -- where one bard recited his work and another, responded to it, often on the spot entirely.Author, photographerThe same image is being cynically and calculatedly drummed home by pairing Hillary and Obama. Hillary will be her own candidate and run her own campaign if she runs, but that won\u0027t stop the GOP from trying to smear her with Obama.Author and political analystEver since I was in my early 20s, you could set my mood-ometer to the fall weekend when we changed the clocks back. Losing an hour of daylight at the end of the day pushes me into the SAD zone -- I suffer Seasonal Affective Disorder.The poison pill for private sector unions is likely be a model bill from the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) with the Orwellian name of \"right to work.\"The Center for Media and Democracy/ALEC ExposedSomething changes when your parents get divorced, when you console your friends after devastating breakups, when an argument changes the course of a relationship and no matter how many apologies happen it\u0027s still heading due South.Associate Editor, Blogs \u0026 CommunityGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"I\u0027M MINDING MY BUSINESS, OFFICER, I\u0027M MINDING MY BUSINESS.
