{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Davidson-Kahn Distinguished University Professor and Professor of Law at Florida International University; Floershimer Distinguished Visiting Professor of Law at Cardozo Law SchoolCarly Fiorina recognizes the danger that a technology-dominated classroom -- a classroom focused on programmable skills rather than on messy and ever-changing ideas -- will become the location of job training rather than intellectual exploration. Education\u0027s great task, she said at a recent New Hampshire education summit, is not to prepare people for jobs, but to \"fill children\u0027s souls,\" to make of them the kinds of citizens who can contribute to a participatory democracy. And that task, she insisted, requires exposure to music, literature, art and philosophy -- the very subjects that are currently falling by the wayside in the rush (aided and abetted by computer learning) to elevate the STEM subjects to the be all and end all.\"We\u0027re going to push and push until some larger force makes us stop.\" David Addington, the legal adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney, made that declaration to Jack Goldsmith of the Office of Legal Counsel in the months after September 11, 2001.Professor of Literature, Yale UniversityIf someone really thinks the great \"email\" story -- or the Benghazi investigation -- are going to sink her candidacy, I\u0027ve got a bridge to sell them.Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersPlease, pit bull lovers, stop saying \"it\u0027s all how they\u0027re raised.\" I know you mean well. But if you truly believe \"it\u0027s all how they\u0027re raised,\" no stray shelter dog or abused dog would be safe to place in a home.Dog trainer. Canine, feline and equine behavior counselor. Animal behavior nerd.Joe Biden certainly has got the media talking. All it really took was one leak to Maureen Dowd and a meeting with Senator Elizabeth Warren, and he\u0027s now seriously considering it. But a Biden candidacy bears political examination beyond the simple question of \"Will he or won\u0027t he run?\"Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comIt is important that the public have a clear idea of what is at stake in the Fed\u0027s decisions on interest rates. While many politicians and policy experts are grappling with ways to try to lower the poverty rate, the Fed will be directly preventing people from seeing pay increases.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Hillary Clinton is sinking like a stone. She\u0027s falling in the polls. Conversations with her longtime friends and admirers indicate grave worry. She is not generating the excitement that the first prospective woman president should; the email mess is not going away; even the money advantage is not what was anticipated.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Transforming the original transistor into the devices that adorn the Apple Watch didn\u0027t require one advance, or ten advances, or even a hundred advances -- it took decades of effort by thousands of scientists and engineers in academic and industrial labs across the U.S.Professor of Chemistry and Director of the Cornell Center for Materials ResearchReading the paper is all too often a jarring experience, but it was especially so on Monday. It\u0027s impossible to ignore the disconnect between the well-deserved recognition of Julian Bond\u0027s life, and the stark evidence that we have so far to go in order to secure the ideals he championed.Founder, People for the American WayWhat the corporate media cannot see is that the era of the Bill Clinton \"New Democrat\" is finished. In the real world, the crash of 2008 blew the lid off the bipartisan \"Washington consensus\" with its blind faith in the benevolence of capitalism. But now I see a silver lining in the absurdity of the \"permanent campaign\": Bernie Sanders has a whole year to build a vibrant, multifaceted social movement.Professor, historian, authorIn 1997, the movie Wag the Dog told the tale of an American President who created a fictitious war against Albania to distract from domestic scandals, ensuring reelection. Turkey\u0027s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan must have seen it, as he\u0027s following the same script against the Kurds in order to boost his party\u0027s flagging fortunes. But will it work?Political science professor, LaGrange College in GeorgiaGov. Kasich thinks the problem with teachers is the teachers\u0027 lounge. The problem with teachers is this: We are having to deal with laws that are being passed by people who have not one single clue as to what our job entails. Go ahead, good sir! Get rid of the teachers\u0027 lounge. We probably won\u0027t even notice. We\u0027re too busy doing our job.Blogs at accidentaldevotional.com. Lives and teaches in AtlantaCalifornia as a whole, like its great university system, is living on capital generated in the past by leaders who had a constructive vision. This generation is letting it run down. Their gaze is fixed on coping strategies while frittering away resources on the grandiose.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghJust like the GReferendum, the new elections are not about democracy or the voice of the Greek people, they are about increasing the power of Tsipras within his own party, the increasingly misnamed Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza), and within Greece.Associate professor in the School of Public and International Affairs at the University of GeorgiaI\u0027m 57 years old and I\u0027ve worked for McDonald\u0027s for seven years, getting paid a few pennies above the federal minimum wage. For a long time, I felt like I had no choice but to accept $7.65 an hour and the daily struggles that come along with that poverty wage. But in the last year, all that has changed.McDonald\u0027s workerPit bulls are dogs. Just dogs. Gloriously, dogs. Like all dogs, they need love, socialization, supervision -- the whole usual shebang. And as with dogs generally, most of them are smooshy lovebugs. Unfortunately, the few who aren\u0027t get the lion\u0027s share of attention.Animal Welfare Editor, The Huffington PostWe had all passed FBI background checks and were instructed to bring nothing into the prison with us, except our gloves, baseballs, batting helmets, four wood bats, water and our drivers licenses, which were shown repeatedly to the guards at the checkpoints leading in and out of the prison.Founder/publisher of Boulder Weekly, an award-winning alternative weekly in its 22nd year of publication.If only she saw the real him. I wonder how many experiences of unconditional love she and people like her miss out on due to fear and hatred in their heart. They may be one of the One Million Moms, but I feel like the luckiest mom in the world to be Chris\u0027 mom.Feisty physically disabled chick, proud mom, advocate, writer, coffee addict, cat lover, reality TV junkie, eternal optimistKatrina pushed us to consider new ways of reaching hard-to-reach populations; now, the challenge is to keep that momentum going, so that the lapses in our initial response to Katrina are never repeated.Physician, epidemiologist, Dean, Boston University School of Public Health. Musing on improving the health of populations.Have you ever felt you were losing your way? Cut adrift on a raging sea? I know I have. When I was reaching the top of Honeywell, I was working 24/7. Having succeeded in turning around a series of troubled businesses, I was tasked with even more turnarounds.Senior Fellow, Harvard Business SchoolOn August 7, the Senate left town for its month-long summer recess, a pretty long break for lawmakers who have accomplished so little. When the Senate returns on September 8, it needs to start doing the people\u0027s business. Surely, the American people, and our federal judicial system, deserve better than this.Vice President, Constitutional Accountability Center (CAC).The real war on religion is being waged by those on the Right who read the Bible not as the story of God\u0027s saving interaction with the world through the unfolding of God\u0027s reign, but either as foundational for a conservative politics of self-interest or as a blueprint for a post-Enlightenment cult of individual piety.Author; Editor; Speaker; ActivistWhy are some drugs legal and some prohibited? Why do we arrest approximately 600,000 Americans each year for marijuana possession, but sell tobacco and alcohol on most corners? Why do we lock up people who use meth for years, and dole out the similar drug Ritalin to our children?Director of Media Relations, Drug Policy AllianceI am so proud of CPT Kristen Griest and 1LT Shaye Haver, and am excited to watch their career progress. Though, to be honest, I am also a bit jealous. They were afforded an opportunity, gave it their all, and succeeded. It is not a complicated concept. Opportunity preparation \u003d success.Law student; VeteranIt\u0027s hard enough to keep up with changing nutritional guidelines. But unless you\u0027re an expert, it\u0027s damn near impossible to tell the difference between independent research and research ginned up by trade groups and marketers.USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorThe American public has given its grade to national elected leaders for their attempts to improve the country\u0027s public schools. The verdict is an \"F\" for failure. Public schools need to do better but that will only occur when there is cooperation in government, not antagonism.Founder, and former President, Center on Education PolicyMocking the absurdity of Lebanon\u0027s politicians and complaining about corruption has become a national past time. The political elite, while still seemingly somewhat in control, have proved themselves to be completely incompetent. Not once, not twice, but relentlessly.Correspondent/producer, VICEThe reality is that spending countless days in the company of a single person can drive even the most loved-up individual to the brink of insanity.Where to go, stay and play on your next great vacation.In the past 2.5 years I have been to 47 cities across three continents. Some of these tricks apply specifically to women, but a lot are just helpful for anyone who likes to travel. Here\u0027s a massive brain-dump, so let\u0027s do this!Writer, designer and adventurer. Founder of Lemonaid-www.lemonaid.ioWhile middle-class white gays and lesbians picketed the White House wearing suits and skirts, trans women of color threw their heels at police officers and taunted the cops by forming kick-lines and singing raunchy songs. While assimilation-oriented gays pleaded with the queer community for peace in Greenwich Village, enraged queers used parking meters as battering rams to break down the door of the Stonewall Inn and reclaim their safe space from the mob and the police.Rhodes Scholar, researcher, writer, explorerThat pit bulls have an image problem is an understatement and that translates into a shelter adoption problem that leaves many pit bull-type dogs to languish and perish in American animal shelters.
