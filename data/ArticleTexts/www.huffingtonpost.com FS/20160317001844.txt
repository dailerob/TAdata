{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor of Law, UCLANo one can say that Garland is a political pick. He does not have a notably liberal record, and as a white male he does not appeal to die-hard liberals. Obama didn\u0027t pick him to motivate voters. He picked him because he is a bipartisan choice who is undoubtedly qualified for the position. Will that be enough for the Senate to confirm him? Garland is the type of pick that makes it especially hard for Republicans to carry through their unprecedented refusal to hold hearings. The last time Garland was up for a Senate vote, Sen. Hatch accused Republicans who didn\u0027t support him of playing politics with the nomination process. His track record of consensus and moderation defies the inevitable claims that he is some radical.If Hillary Clinton wins the Democratic presidential nomination, her supporters will need to be on guard for cheap shots about such irrelevancies as her wardrobe, voice and femininity. Not because she can\u0027t take the heat, but because things are bound to get much worse.Professor Emerita, USC Marshall School; Author, \u0027The Secret Handshake\u0027 and \u0027Shadow Campus\u0027From their \"Dark Money\" bagman Karl Rove to their philosophical guru David Brooks, the GOP elites are in a tizzy over saving the Republican Party from Donald Trump and the other intruders, extremists and crackpots who have fallen in behind Trump as if he were the Pied Piper of Hamelin. But who will save the party from the elites?Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanySenior writer, BillMoyers.com. Former senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.\"Is there anything more fun than a Trump rally?\" he asks his frenzied fans. Because, really, what could humans possibly find more enjoyable than gathering together in a huge crowd to hit and hate?Paul Slansky is amassing a memory for Americans allergic to accountability and addicted to amnesia.The ability to quickly absorb major disruptions in public transportation access ?is in many ways its own form of economic privilege. And that seems to be lost on far too many.Senior media coordinator, Center for American ProgressQuestions have arisen in recent days about whether Donald Trump, his supporters, and his opponents have acted in ways that either violate the First Amendment or can be punished consistent with the First Amendment. Here are some questions and answers.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoWith the established audience Mark Ruffalo brings with him, Congressional Member Organizations such as the Safe Climate Caucus or even the newly established bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus would jump at the opportunity to welcome him as an ally.Sustainability Consultant/Former Coordinator, Value Chain Outreach and Responsible Care for the American Chemistry Council (ACC)Although at the present time it\u0027s kind of hard to believe, there is a faction of the Republican Party which looks towards the future and sees some very problematic demographic shifts awaiting it.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comIn refusing to vote or even hold a hearing on the President\u0027s nominee to the Supreme Court, the GOP is abdicating its constitutional responsibility. It\u0027s not doing its job.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027As a Republican, I\u0027m sorry. We have failed you, as a party, and as individuals. We didn\u0027t see this coming, and we absolutely should have. This is not what I was raised to be a part of, and it embarrasses me to see what our public face has become today.Frustrated Republican with a keyboardThe second super-Tuesday primaries have come and gone. Five wins for Hillary including Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, Illinois and Missouri have increased her pledged delegate lead to over 300. Realistically that signals the end of Bernie Sanders chance at the nomination.non-profit consultant, public speaker and political activistYou probably know that former pro wrestler Hulk Hogan is suing Gawker for $100 million for posting a video that included a brief snippet of him having sex with a friend\u0027s wife. And the fact that you probably know this helps explain why this is an important case and why Hulk Hogan has no claim.Professor, University of Michigan Law SchoolThe deepest irony of the whole thing was being surrounded by people who mock underprivileged minorities for seeking autonomous \"safe spaces\" while crying for the government to build a literal wall around them all and kill every single person they\u0027re afraid of.BCI Engineer, TEDx talker, lover of almost all things humanBranko Milanovic is one of the world\u0027s leading experts on inequality, having spent decades at the World Bank studying patterns within and between countries. He therefore brings an enormous scope of knowledge of recent and past income trends to his new book.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027President Obama\u0027s decision to make a historic visit to Cuba later this month is about more than U.S. politics or business opportunities on the island.Senior Fellow, Foreign Policy, Project on International Order and Strategy, Latin America Initiative, The Brookings InstitutionProfessor at UC San Diego, Senior Fellow at the Brookings InstitutionThis September, Mother Teresa will become Saint Teresa. This is unsurprising; she was beatified in 2003, which is sort of a one-way road to canonization. But it\u0027s the last thing we need. She was no saint.Associate Editor, What\u0027s WorkingThe bottom line is that Clinton does not have to prove anything to AIPAC. Its constituency is solidly in her corner. And that is why the AIPAC speech provides her with a real opportunity.Worked on Capitol Hill for Democratic Senators and House members for 20 yearsIf you\u0027re an author with aspirations of seeing your work adapted for film or TV, people love to look at you like you\u0027re a sad puppy. \"Oh, but movies are never as good as the book,\" they say. But is that really true? Happily, no.Bestselling authorIt\u0027s the violence which redefined everything: our hopes, our beliefs, and our trust in the world. At a very early stage I had to rethink the answers to many violent questions: Am I a murderer? Am I capable of killing? Do I want to kill?Setting a unique news agenda that builds bridges and global understanding since 2005.In America, the D-word in the context of addiction has come to mean something much different from the word \"disease\" used for any other condition -- something that unfortunately is more moral than medical.The full spectrum of human relationships with drugsPoliticians may promise that erecting barriers to trade will bring back both factory wages and jobs of the past, but that is fantasy. Protectionism would probably benefit robots, not workers. And the three-quarters of the labor force that would remain in the service sector, many of them working for low pay, would find their standard of living further eroded by higher import prices.Economist, Educator and AuthorI was only 17 when I first heard it, a senior in high school. I was a sheltered kid in the suburbs with an intact family with no troubled past, ready to head off to a renowned university.
