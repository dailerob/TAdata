What Sanders has done is to establish himself as a force in the Democratic Party\u0027s selection process. He has done so by demonstrating two qualities that have largely disappeared from America\u0027s political life over the past few decades. One is conviction and intellectual honesty. The other is articulate statement of a progressive creed that was the party\u0027s heart and soul when it dominated the country\u0027s electoral life, before lapsing into the \"me-too\" wing of our current Establishment uniparty. Sanders, thereby, has flinted a spark of life into those nominally liberal circles whose lazy and complacent inertia had led them to declare the compromised Hillary Clinton as their latest champion.So far forest partnerships are not featuring prominently in climate discussions heading into Paris. The talks are focusing on what each country can do by itself, instead of also looking at what more we can do by working together. This is a miscalculation.CEO, UnileverYes, Donald Trump deserves to be vilified for his egregious, sexist comments. But it\u0027s not like this new commentary from the political right sets the GOP\u0027s own records straight. Let\u0027s not be too quick to gloss over the litany of GOP candidates who all have serious check marks against them when it comes to upholding and respecting women\u0027s rights.Host/Producer, HuffPost LiveIt still hasn\u0027t hit me. I\u0027m living my dream and I look forward to continuing to work hard towards becoming a better, stronger dancer. Now that we\u0027re here, my hope is that in time, this won\u0027t be such a rare achievement, and my reviews and mentions in the media will refer to me simply as a \"ballerina,\" because that\u0027s what I am.Principal Dancer, American Ballet TheatreEvery day for the past two years I woke up with a purpose: to return to the IAAF World Championships. For two full years I trained. Thousands of miles logged, hours spent in the pool, at the gym, and countless other sacrifices made. I was all set to go until last night when I received an email from American track and field\u0027s governing body, USATF.800-meter runner, Two-time Olympian, Six-time U.S. championThe SEC\u0027s disclosure rule isn\u0027t perfect. Some corporations could try to game it by contracting out their low-wage jobs. Some industries pay their typical workers higher wages than other industries. But the rule marks an important start.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Every word used to describe the way you feel after a miscarriage epitomizes everything you are in that moment... empty, hollow, exposed -- but none of those words describe what you really are... overwhelmed, devastated, and incredibly sad.Registered nurse behind the blog Adventures of a Labor Nurse: the Highs and Lows of Labor and DeliveryFocusing mainly on how many classified emails were on Hillary Clinton\u0027s illegal server misses a fundamental point: MOST of Secretary Clinton\u0027s emails would have been sensitive because she was the Secretary of State.Fmr. Defense and State Department advisor during the George W. Bush administrationStudies show the number of illegal firings of union activists increasing and the number of union members in the United States dwindling. Workers need legislation to stop it.International President, United SteelworkersMore than five years after the passage of Dodd-Frank the SEC finally issued rules on disclosure of CEO pay last week. This is useful information for trends in inequality. Corporate lobbyists have spent the last five years complaining that this disclosure would impose an enormous burden.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027From these experiences, today\u0027s leaders learned what not to do, as they witnessed many of their predecessors trap themselves chasing money, fame, and power - losing sight of their True North. They learned the perils of putting self-interest ahead of the institutions they led.Professor of Management Practice, Harvard Business SchoolThe NRA has been pissing and moaning about public health and clinical views on gun violence for more than 20 years, and Wheeler is often quoted whenever relevant research is published and, in time-honored fashion, the media needs a comment from the \"other side.\"Mike the Gun GuyThe entire political punditry world has been holding its collective breath since last Thursday night, waiting for some polling numbers to interpret. But one question in particular seems to show some very bad news for the Republican Party.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comTo Sam and Nia, I send my heartfelt condolences. I thank you for sharing your journey with the world and for allowing the world to grieve with you. While we join them in mourning the loss of the child they\u0027d only just started to celebrate, I think there are many things we can take away from their very public experience.Filmmaker | Writer | MotherIt is a beautiful thing to have a feeling, a notion and then transform it into something tangible. It\u0027s like being in the X-Men.Author, An Untamed State and AyitiCompared to the disruptive effect of Donald Trump on the Republican field, BLM is a picnic for Democrats. Trump is a caricature of things that more mannered Republicans have been getting away with for years. He smokes out what the Republicans really stand for. No wonder they are worried.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027There is a dangerous trend spreading across the globe where people are putting themselves in harm\u0027s way to click the perfect \"selfie.\" As a mother of three I would like to start a campaign know as \"Safe Selfies.\" Below are some tips and tricks to practice while taking \"selfies\" to ensure that they are safe, secure and in good taste.Blogger at That\u0027s InappropriateSarah Palin uses her Facebook page to comment on all things political, including touting Donald Trump\u0027s candidacy for the presidency. But when it comes to Trump\u0027s outrageously sexist comments about Megyn Kelly, Palin has remained shamefully silent about El Donaldo\u0027s latest round of misogyny.Author and filmmakerI know Rosie O\u0027Donnell. Rosie is a friend of mine. And you, Donald Trump, are no Rosie O\u0027Donnell.President, Elizabeth Birch Company/Global OutSome who know me and my work would be very surprised that I have been slow to come out to my stepson. Even for a hard core transgender activist and sex educator, confronting the shame that I may be dumping on my kids head in the middle of teenage angst and middle school has been hard to bear.Known as \"The Gender Sensei\" Educator and activist on gender, sexuality and LGBTQ rightsMegyn Kelly is a smart lawyer, a tough litigator and a hard questioner who played Trump like a skilled violinist. I look forward to a rematch in January 2016 when Fox News once again hosts a GOP Presidential debate -- that is, if Trump is still running and one of the other networks hasn\u0027t hired Kelly for something bigger than cable news.Economist, author and public policy commentatorUnless and until white Americans recognize that the very forces that plunder and kill black bodies are a product of forces that sustain white privilege in a way that will ultimately destroy the planet itself, racism will be kept at a distance -- a \"problem\" to be solved. And it never will be.Professor of Theology, Chicago Theological SeminaryThe Republican Party doesn\u0027t seem to understand the fact that threats to the United States originate from the actions of human beings. These human beings resort to violence when they are marginalized by society to the point where they believe that the only way to better their country is to work around the democratic system through violence.Research assistant for the Global Initiative for Civil Society and Conflict. Writer for The Hill.It\u0027s not terribly surprising to learn that many trafficking victims have been exploited in a hotel. An NGO recently launched #DoesYourHotelKnow, a new awareness campaign that alerts hotels and travelers on what to do if we think it\u0027s happening (key: you don\u0027t have to be certain, that\u0027s up to the authorities to figure out).Journalist + founder of ethical fashion shop, Good ClothDear potential future child: despite the fact that there are 7 billion some people that exist in this world, you are relevant and always will be. You are your best possible self every minute of every day because you are human, and I love you for it.Human BeingImagine how many more people a doctor would have to hire just to deal with a boatload of new insurers. Or to deal with a bunch of politicians who don\u0027t know what they\u0027re talking about.Author, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgGay men should heed the call at once and come to the defense of women, all women, and their liberty. I not saying we need to take charge or \"mansplain\" anything to anyone. But where are we gay men in their struggle?Yale professor, author on Korea, Japan,and queer culture. His novel The Rise and Fall of the Yellow House will be released this fall.The American agreement with Turkey may bring U.S. drones and bombers a thousand miles closer to ISIS targets. But in the long run, it sets the Kurds back yet again in their dream of independence. As they say in the Arabian peninsula, one should not drink poison to quench a thirst.Founding Chairman, Business Executives for National SecurityThere is no way you can argue with me that it is ever okay to throw anything on the ground. Even if you hand me free Nickelback tickets, I will happily walk them to the nearest garbage.Actor, comedian, award-winning writerTrump\u0027s comments talking about \"blood coming out of her whatever,\" were more than just some rantings of an unseasoned political candidate making a gaffe. It was a trial balloon of sorts.Political science professor, LaGrange College in GeorgiaNow, at 8 months, with a whole new world to explore as she has learned to crawl, pull herself up and communicate in new ways, I find myself being needed more than ever, with a waking baby in the night who wants to nurse.Founder, Girls\u0027 GlobeGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
