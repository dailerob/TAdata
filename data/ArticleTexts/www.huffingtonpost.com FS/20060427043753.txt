GhanbariFrom wonders.orgReading the MSM\u0027s coverage of Ken Lay\u0027s testimony -- side by side with its coverage of George Bush\u0027s latest bleating about energy -- I\u0027ve been struck by how little discussion there is of Lay\u0027s and Enron\u0027s deep connections to Bush, Cheney, and the White House\u0027s energy company-dictated energy policy.
