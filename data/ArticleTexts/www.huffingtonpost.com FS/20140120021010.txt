{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonAcademy Award nominations were released Thursday, and it was clear that Oscar voters were really into retro movies about bad guys, swindlers and financial fiascoes -- with American Hustle and The Wolf of Wall Street both scoring big. Meanwhile, on the other coast, today\u0027s bad guys, swindlers and fiascoes were a lot less entertaining. On Wall Street, modern wolves continue to wreak havoc with impunity: according to a new study, in recent years, the government hasn\u0027t held individuals accountable in two-thirds of the cases in which it\u0027s charged companies with crimes. And in D.C., a bipartisan group of senators continued its attempt to scuttle talks with Iran by imposing more sanctions -- a move the Obama administration said would amount to a \"march to war.\" America\u0027s Unnecessary Middle East War franchise is not one that needs a remake, and this scenario should quickly be put into turnaround. If not, All Is Lost may become more than the title of a snubbed film.Comments (12)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027It\u0027s time to move on from philosophical debates over whether a woman\u0027s place is in the home or the workplace -- women have long been in both. The public conversation we must have now should be about how we can empower women to find their way into economic stability.Comments (92)Kerry KennedyPresident, Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human RightsThe U.S. government must stand on the side of human rights, the rule of law, and democratic progress, not impede or otherwise stunt such progress. If U.S. policy towards Egypt remains unchanged, we will be complicit in continued human rights violations, a totally unacceptable and untenable situation.Comments (59)Bill GeorgeProfessor of Management Practice, Harvard Business SchoolAs an executive, you would never wish for a major crisis, but as I have learned in crises at other firms, they can make your company more effective and your organization more unified and committed to its True North in the long run. Ultimately, I predict the same thing will happen at Target.CommentsRobert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, Beyond OutrageThat David Brooks, among the most thoughtful of all conservative pundits, doesn\u0027t see or acknowledge any of the signs pointing to how far the right has moved away from the reality most Americans live in every day.Comments (505)Arianna HuffingtonAnimals help us be better humans. Quite often, they show us how to be our best selves. Always in the moment, sticking their noses into everything (literally), they see a world that we take for granted, one we\u0027re usually just hurriedly passing through on our way to lives we never quite reach.Comments (35)Jeff JarvisAuthor, \u0027Public Parts\u0027 and \u0027What Would Google Do?\u0027Imagine a world in which there is no stigma about illness, in which ailments are not a matter of privacy or lost insurance or jobs, in which we collectively share and learn as much as we can about what afflicts us so it can afflict fewer. It\u0027s just data.CommentsMarian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe holiday celebrating Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u0027s birthday is used as an opportunity to teach children about his legacy. But in too many of those same schools, black and other nonwhite children\u0027s extraordinary talents are still being wasted.Comments (89)Merton BernsteinColes Professor of Law Emeritus, Washington UniversityPresident Obama\u0027s proposal that Congress authorize \"outside government\" public advocates is doubly useless: (1) Congress legislates almost nothing; and (2) such advocates would be too slow and limited to provide balance between intelligence needs and constitutional protections. The FISA Court can provide the rules.Comments (14)TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"Forget broken bones in doctor\u0027s offices and suitcases at the airport. Artist Nick Veasey turns his x-ray machine on the whole world, and these pictures will make you see it in an entirely new way.Comments (13)James ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027In a meeting I had this week with a congressional candidate, I was reminded of the power of the myths that define conventional wisdom about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the challenge they pose for rational discourse.Comments (72)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarCongratulations. Elvis didn\u0027t make it this far. Here is a random list of personal thoughts in the measure and meaning of a half century on the planet.CommentsRalph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and author14 hospitals in the United States are charging more than ten times their costs for treatment. Specifically, for every $100 one of these hospitals spends, the charge on the corresponding bill is nearly $1,200.Comments (130)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistOkay, TV aficionados, here\u0027s a pop quiz. What do All in the Family, The Simpsons, Happy Days and Dallas have in common? They were all midseason replacements.CommentsDirk HughesCollege registrar in Western MichiganMy story is not unique. It may be surprising, but it is not unique. I have a doctorate. I have been employed full-time for 35 years with only a week or so between jobs. I have worked my butt off my entire adult life. I do not have a drinking or gambling problem. And I still live paycheck to paycheck.Comments (822)Kathleen ReardonProfessor, USC Marshall School; Author, \u0027The Secret Handshake\u0027 and \u0027Shadow Campus\u0027If you haven\u0027t had Stage 4 cancer -- or any of a host of challenging and often frightening illnesses -- then give us all a break and find another topic. Start a different trend. Leave the rest of us to getting on with things the best way we know how.Comments (40)Kia MakarechiSenior Editor for Mobile and Innovations, The Huffington PostOutrage fatigue is like anti-intellectualism for conservatives and liberals (and especially neo-liberals) alike.Comments (32)Soraya ChemalyFeminist, Writer, Satirist... not always in that orderThese are just this weekend\u0027s examples of men having a hard time sharing culture. Sounds an awful lot like my 3-year-old brother, who used to chant, \"Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!!!\"Comments (71)Tavis SmileyPBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorThe scion of a distinguished family of politicians, Dern talks about his early years growing up and why he chose acting as his career.CommentsShanell MoulandMother, teacher and writerYou could have shifted uncomfortably in your seat. You could have ignored her. You could have given me that \"smile\" that I despise because it means, \"Manage your child please.\" You did none of that.Comments (303)Nick TurseManaging Editor, TomDispatch.comThe Obama presidency has seen the U.S. military\u0027s elite tactical forces increasingly used in an attempt to achieve strategic goals. But with Special Operations missions kept under tight wraps, Americans have little understanding of where their troops are deployed, what exactly they are doing, or what the consequences might be down the road.Comments (25)Sarah MacLaughlin, LSWParenting educator and coachThere is something about your child looking you straight in the eye and saying, \"No, I won\u0027t do that,\" \"I hate you,\" or, \"You can\u0027t make me,\" that challenges you to the core. You are so not alone.Comments (58)Inae OhAssociate Editor, HuffPost NYJust because Dunham is a young feminist who speaks confidently about her \"real body\" does not mean we get to qualify her statements with an inappropriate cash prize.Comments (47)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkWhile the investigation continues, subpoenas get issued and details hashed out, one thing has become abundantly clear: the residents of Fort Lee and the people of New Jersey were treated as some sort of an afterthought.Comments (13)Emma GraySenior Editor, HuffPost WomenThe Tonya Harding-Nancy Kerrigan story played out like a Lifetime movie, and members of the media ate it up like tabloid candy. It had a catfight element that we love so much, and a class-war theme (even though Kerrigan also came from a working-class family): \"The Reigning Ice Princess Taken Down By The White-Trash Wannabe.\"Comments (270)Clive DavisRecord producerRather than shrug it off as another expected Streep tour de force, marvel at the ability of this remarkable actress to touch you and affect your emotions like no one else.Comments (14)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesIn an interview with me at the 2008 RNC, Sally Kern repeated a line she\u0027d said before, that \"we\u0027re becoming so open-minded that our brains are falling out.\" Well, Kern\u0027s brain must be toppling all over the sidewalk, after a federal judge in Oklahoma ruled yesterday that the state\u0027s ban on gay marriage is unconstitutional.Comments (315)Julie ColeMother of six and co-founding VP, Mabel\u0027s LabelsSure, there are some days when I wonder what I\u0027ve gotten myself into, worry about the world they\u0027ll inherit and consider the environmental footprint of a family like mine. But most of the time, I just celebrate how awesome it is to have six kids.CommentsEarl Ofari HutchinsonAuthor and political analystThe blind eye, indifference or even outright disrespect of the King holiday 28 years after the first was officially observed shouldn\u0027t really surprise. It took decades and hard battles to get the King federal holiday bill enacted in the first place.Comments (29)Katie HeaneyPeople have interesting reactions when you tell them you\u0027ve never had a boyfriend and you\u0027re over the age of 21. Most girls are pretty good at acting like they aren\u0027t shocked, because most of them have at least one friend who doesn\u0027t date as much as the others for whom they\u0027ve learned to be uncondescendingly empathetic.Comments (215)Eric WaggonerChair, English department, West Virginia Wesleyan CollegeTo hell with you all for continuing to exploit the lax, poorly enforced safety regulations here so that you could do your business in the cheapest manner possible by shortcutting the health and quality of life not only of your workers but of everybody who lives here.Comments (246)Bizzy Emerson, 2014.19.01HuffPost Radio, 2014.19.01Dorian de Wind, 2014.19.01Jeff Schweitzer, 2014.19.01Holly Robinson, 2014.19.01Greg Savage, 2014.19.01Steven Conn, 2014.19.01Christopher Emdin, 2014.19.01Penina Rybak, 2014.19.01Dr. Reese Halter, 2014.19.01Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"LIVE: IT\u0027S ON 20-17 SEA",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BizYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
