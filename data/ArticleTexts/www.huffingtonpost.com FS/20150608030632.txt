You see, in the Dominican case, the country has used anti-immigrant rhetoric against its own racial minority citizens. But they are not immigrants!Professor of Law, Florida International UniversityAttorney General Loretta Lynch and her FBI colleagues have done their job.

But has giving a beggar a coin ever been as effective as creating an economy that provides him or her a good education and a job?President, Children\u0027s Defense FundThere are many ways to live life -- there is no right or wrong.
