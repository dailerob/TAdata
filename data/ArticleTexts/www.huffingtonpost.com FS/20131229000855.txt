{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundIn the last few days of this year, most Americans are wrapping up their holiday celebrations and pondering the promise of 2014. But millions of Americans who have been struggling the longest to find work in our slowly recovering economy are now facing deep uncertainty and despair instead of a Happy New Year. The budget deal Congress finally reached in December did not extend emergency unemployment insurance benefits for the long-term unemployed and 1.3 million struggling jobseekers are losing those desperately needed survival benefits. This is the first time Congress has let long-term unemployment insurance benefits expire when the long-term jobless were more than 1.3 percent of the labor force. Today 2.6 percent of the labor force is long-term unemployed in our still sluggish economy.Comments (48)Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H.

But also mentors, the end of a need for gender quotas, and balance, however you choose to define it.CommentsTEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"At first glance, a choir may seem like nothing more than a group of singers. But look a little closer. Conductor Eric Whitacre\u0027s performers don\u0027t simply sing. They remind us of what it means to be truly connected.Comments (22)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, Beyond OutrageWhatever happened to American can-do optimism? Even before the Affordable Care Act covers its first beneficiary, the nattering nabobs of negativism are out in full force.Comments (213)Rep. Debbie Wasserman SchultzAuthor, \u0027For the Next Generation\u0027; Chair, Democratic National CommitteeThe Republican party\u0027s government shutdown that lasted 16 days and cost the economy $24 billion offered a clear illustration of the dysfunction in Washington. But it doesn\u0027t have to be that way.Comments (66)Elana Miller, MDPsychiatrist and writer at Zen PsychiatryLove is when the CT scan comes back, and the doctor carefully, gently, sits down on the gurney next to me and asks if I would like to read it with him. Love is when I know this cancer will hurt, and will make me sick, but it will not kill me.CommentsNoah MichelsonEditor, HuffPost Gay VoicesYou can say whatever you want. As long as there\u0027s enough money and publicity swirling and more ready to be made, you will face absolutely no consequences and if anything you\u0027ll be celebrated as a hero and lauded as an icon of freedom.Comments (490)Devon CornealMother, writer, lawyerHe\u0027s so innocent and I\u0027m so jaded and I want to preserve this curiosity and openness forever, but I can\u0027t. He thinks I know the answers.CommentsBob CescaManaging Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowActivists like Snowden want you to believe that NSA is directly, and without court approval, spying on you personally, because hyperbole like this feeds an agenda that involves scaring anyone susceptible to anti-government paranoia.Comments (142)Mark C. MillerHumoristSay you arrive one day for an important job interview, but find there\u0027s no job, no interviewer and no office. Instead, as soon as you open the door, you find festive balloons and 20 people in an apartment shouting to you, \"Welcome to your new home!\"Comments (40)James ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027The Middle East promises to be every bit as complicated and challenging to US policy-makers as it has been in the year just ending. There is a dizzying array of conflicts and crises unfolding across the region -- all of which will involve the US in the year to come.CommentsKatherine BraunClinic Director and Founder, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation, Inc.My patients tell me that sometimes they cannot figure out what hurts more, the lightening of their wallet or the recurring back aches and pains during the holiday season.CommentsMichelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesToo many people are dismissing the action of A\u0026E at reinstating Phil Robertson so soon after suspending him from Duck Dynasty. It\u0027s just a TV show, they say, and we have all of these wins on marriage equality -- and look at Utah!Comments (209)Chris KellyWriter, \u0027Real Time with Bill Maher\u0027I\u0027m a busy man, and I like my news in 50-to-100-word chunks, like fragments of Sappho. So I couldn\u0027t get by without the news aggregation site Newser.CommentsJes BakerBlogger, The Militant BakerYou\u0027re allowed to fall in love with yourself. I promise. This will be the scariest thing you will ever do, and that\u0027s okay. It will also be the most amazing (albeit super gradual) experience you will ever have.Comments (578)David Katz, M.D.Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterResolutions, born of a \"ready or not, let\u0027s go\" mentality, invite failure. So reinvent your resolutions and make them more likely to succeed. Resolve to get ready, and go only when you are.CommentsJulie TarneyWriterMy heart swelled as I patted Harry\u0027s head. He was happy, and so was I. Because while too many people questioned my young son\u0027s preferences, and therefore my skills as a mother, we both stood strong with a cartoon rabbit who carried an anvil in his pink purse.Comments (53)Janet TavakoliPresident, Tavakoli Structured FinanceSince our city leaders love to tout statistics to tell us crime is down, then let\u0027s see if their statistics stand up to a basic test from additional statistics.CommentsRana FloridaCEO, The Creative Class Group \u0026 Author, UpgradeFrom silver streamers to Champagne towers, from winter picnics to royal recipes, you can throw a New Year\u0027s party with a vibe that\u0027s black tie formal, fun, and laid-back, all at the same time.CommentsPaul StollerProfessor of Anthropology, West Chester University; Author, \u0027The Power of the Between\u0027The Kansas Board of Regents, many members of which have been appointed by the governor, has voted to restrict academic free speech.Comments (43)Jessica RassetteBlogger, PhotographerI decided I should always parent my kids as if there was a drywall repairman in the basement.

I appreciate the sentiment behind them, but I believe most resolutions are doomed to failure. Why? Because resolutions are generally too vague (or extreme) and most people don\u0027t know how to create a realistic plan for making them happen.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorIf I may be permitted -- and I\u0027m bragging on my friends, not me -- we at CBPP make a lot of revealing graphs. But I\u0027ve chosen the ones that I think shine the brightest light on the path back to smart fiscal and economic policy.Comments (38)Brenda PetersonNovelist and nature writerListening to the Virtual Choir Live--4,000 singers strong, from 73 countries--I was reminded of how the whole world is sound and vibration. We humans never sing alone.CommentsThomas E. PerezU.S. Secretary of LaborNew Year\u0027s is supposed to be a time of excitement and new beginnings, but for too many people, it will be a time of desperation.Comments (27)Adam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; co-founder of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911The day after Christmas means a lot of different things to a lot of different people - obligatory gift returns, post-Christmas sales, pouring the last of the eggnog in your coffee, an end to holiday music in public spaces and on public airwaves.CommentsBruce AckermanProfessor of law and political science, Yale; Author \u0027The Decline and Fall of the American Republic\u0027President Obama should not allow the NSA to convince him that his reform program is merely an idealistic wishlist that ignores the endless threats of the 21st century. He should treat the reform initiative as the constitutional minimum required to keep the high-tech dynamo from spinning entirely out of control.CommentsPadmini ParthasarathyJournalist based in New York, NYI was raised an American Hindu who feels more nostalgia for December pine in New York than October sulfur in Mumbai. I didn\u0027t think I would see a Christmas tree this year. And this one was startlingly alive, outside, swaying between private mourning and public celebration.CommentsMark MorfordColumnist, SFGate/San Francisco Chronicle; Author, \u0027The Daring Spectacle: Adventures in Deviant Journalism\u0027, ERYT yoga instructorI dive into this venture with an all-consuming fervor, ignoring how I\u0027m no music critic by training and instead opening wide to 30 years of serious music obsessiveness; couple it to a bottle of Casa Nobles while I blithely ignore everyone else\u0027s obvious year-end picks.CommentsMalik Siraj Akbar, 2013.28.12Edward Erikson, 2013.28.12Kristin Duquette, 2013.28.12Lev Raphael, 2013.28.12Blair Schulman, 2013.28.12Liz Madans, 2013.28.12Katherine Braun, 2013.28.12Sean Martinfield, 2013.28.12Dr. Reese Halter, 2013.28.12Jeryl Brunner, 2013.28.12Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"NO AL QAEDA LINK",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BizYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
