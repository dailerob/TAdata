{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Michael BrennerSenior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghMiddle Eastern politics is rife with paradox in the turbulent aftermath of the Arab Spring. That is the source of much bewilderment as to what recent developments mean for the region as a whole. Washington\u0027s present befuddlement owes to its inability to make sense of, much less resolve multiple paradoxes. In the broad perspective, American influence over other governments has hit an unprecedented low -- yet, the current diplomatic configuration conforms to the pattern existent before January 2011 when the alignment was dominated by American partners and allies. That earlier alignment served the United States\u0027 self-defined strategic interests -- reasonable or not. So, too, does the reconstituted configuration. But a sense of lost control obscures that reality.Comments (57)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureThe debate we\u0027re about to have will affect the lives of many people, and will determine whether fellow human beings live or die. It may shape the geopolitical conflicts of the future. What\u0027s more, the way we choose to conduct that debate will help shape the kind of country we become.Comments (198)James GoodmanAuthor of But Where Is the Lamb? Imagining the Story of Abraham and Isaac.\u0027But where is the lamb?\u0027 I am not sure that there are five more terrifying, or pathetic, words in the Bible.Comments (886)Chuck HagelUnited States Secretary of DefenseThe Department of Defense has no more important responsibility than supporting and protecting those who defend our country, and that means we must do everything possible to prevent military suicide. When one of us faces a challenge, we all must stand together.CommentsLord David OwenFmr. British foreign secretaryIf the proposition to withdraw all chemical weapons were agreed, it would almost certainly be sufficient to bring about an accompanying ceasefire. It would also be an impetus to start the planned conference in Geneva to negotiate a peace settlement.Comments (53)Billie Jean KingFounder, Women’s Sports FoundationIf you are like me and countless other people, you are not only impressed with Diana\u0027s athletic achievement, you are completely inspired by her unwavering commitment to her dream.CommentsJeffrey HadzinskyComedy writerMy mother is a funeral director so I\u0027ve witnessed people dealing with loss my entire life. This did not prepare me at all for what I was about to and am still dealing with to this day.Comments (68)Diane RavitchHistorian, NYU professorClosing schools does not make them better. Nor does closing schools help students. It\u0027s way past time to stop blaming the people who work in troubled schools and start helping them by providing the tools they need and the support their students need.Comments (303)Tamsen FadalJournalist; Author; Co-founder, Shansen JewelryWhile no person or relationship is the same, there are a few signs that are hard to overlook and I wanted to pass them alone.Comments (13)Wendell PotterAuthor, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgPoliticians and the media were all too willing to repeat what CEOs of big for-profit insurance corporations were saying without analyzing their motives or taking into account the fact that the marketplaces will force real competition in the health insurance world.Comments (95)Mike Hogan and Christopher RosenHello, Mike! Just last Friday, you and I were standing in the office and wondering where this year\u0027s awards contenders were hiding. (After all, by that Friday last year, Argo had already debuted.) Then 12 Years A Slave premiered at the Telluride Film Festival that night, and we received our answer.Comments (11)Maureen RyanTV critic, The Huffington PostOnce he had Jesse in his clutches, Hank became Walter White.Comments (435)Andrea ServadioCo-Owner, Fitdog Sports Club, Santa Monica, CASummer is coming to an end and we are are scrambling to get our kids ready with new clothes and supplies while also prepping our households for after-school safety with first aid kits! But what about Fido?!CommentsRana FloridaCEO, The Creative Class Group \u0026 Author, UpgradeIt\u0027s surprising how few organizations encourage risk taking and foster a culture of outside-the box thinking. We are taught to set goals, achieve measurable results and assess success. But we are rarely encouraged to push the boundaries of new ideas and pioneering thoughts.Comments (14)Mike WeisserThe Gun GuyMost of the original environmental conservationists were hunters -- including Theodore Roosevelt and Audubon Society founder, George Bird Grinnell. This alliance no longer exists due to the polarization of the gun control debate.Comments (41)Matthew ChapmanWriter/director, \"The Ledge\", author \"Trials Of The Monkey\"There\u0027s a mayor\u0027s race underway and pugnacious outgoing Mayor Bloomberg has found a way to continue whacking his opponents (and even his friends!) in the nose long after he\u0027s gone.Comments (18)Nina MunkAuthor, The Idealist: Jeffrey Sachs and the Quest to End PovertyThere was no economy to speak of in Dertu. Here and there the nomadic herdsmen passing through would trade or sell livestock, and a modest business was established to sell camel\u0027s milk; otherwise, the only economic activities were gun running and cattle raiding.CommentsMike LawrenceComedianAbsence makes the act grow stronger. Have passions outside of comedy. If you can be a real person, you will be a better comic.CommentsDean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027The Fed\u0027s taper talk at the end of June appears to have taken the air out of this bubble before it had a chance to get out of hand.Comments (41)Kathy CalvinCEO, The United Nations FoundationIn just a few weeks, global leaders will head to New York City for the annual meeting of the United Nations General Assembly and one of the most important conversations of our time. The world\u0027s collective efforts to eradicate extreme poverty will take center stage..CommentsNorman SolomonAuthor, \u0027War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death\u0027Hell hath no fury like war-makers scorned. Simmering rage will be palpable from political elites who do not want to see Congress set an unprecedented precedent: thwarting the will of a president who wants Pentagon firepower unleashed on another country.Comments (1,030)John PavleyCTO @ The Huffington Post, BloggerFor the HuffPost community to grow and develop we must emphasize fairness in access, promote civil discourse, reduce vitriol on our pages and provide a defense against trolling. A key strategy in doing all of this is our plan to require all new members to identify themselves when they create an account.Comments (2,387)Robert CreamerPolitical Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersHistory will judge us harshly, if we stand by idly, and legitimate the use of chemical weapons -- and weapons of mass destruction in general -- by allowing their use in the view of the full world to go unpunished.Comments (874)Christine OwensExecutive Director of the National Employment Law ProjectAh... Labor Day -- one last chance to throw a burger on the grill and take our minds off work. Not usually a day people spend contemplating workers in America. If most of us really stopped to think about the state of workers on Labor Day, we would be in no mood to celebrate.Comments (372)Raymond J. LearsyAuthor, \u0027Ruminations on the Distortion of Oil Prices and Crony Capitalism\u0027Perhaps it is solidarity with the victims of Damascus that has caused Hollande and France to voice their determination, and now to assume a leading role. As if to declare, \u0027We know, we have been there, it can not be permitted to happen again.\"Comments (88)Mamoun MahayniStudent, American University of BeirutWhile visiting New York City, I tried to forget what was happening in my country, but even the news feeds in Times Square would remind me. I guess many Syrians abroad try to numb themselves from what\u0027s going on back home, because whether we like it or not, life goes on.Comments (12)Michael BruneExecutive Director, The Sierra ClubThis Labor Day, the Sierra Club joins in celebrating working people everywhere. If we want to help working families, protect our air and water, and achieve justice for all Americans, we must first defend our democracy.CommentsMelissa SherWriter and blogger, Mammalingo.comLittle kids. They\u0027re sticky. They drip a lot. And they mess up our stuff. But we wouldn\u0027t trade them for anything in the world. We can\u0027t. We\u0027re actually not allowed. Most countries have very strict laws against it. So, since they\u0027re still ours for the next 18 or so years, let\u0027s learn from them.Comments (90)Jeff DanzigerPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideComments (27)Steven StraussAdjunct Lecturer in Public Policy, Harvard Kennedy SchoolPresident Obama\u0027s proposed limited air attack on the Assad regime, with no boots on the ground, is the least bad choice. But whatever the result, the U.S. should avoid getting drawn into a land war in Syria.Comments (161)Jim SleeperLecturer in Political Science, Yale UniversityopenDemocracy.net, one of Britain\u0027s most thoughtful, respected websites, has just posted more of the truth about university-regime collaborations and their implications for U.S. foreign policy.CommentsHead-Roc, 2013. 3.09Edward Corcoran, 2013. 3.09Mark W.
