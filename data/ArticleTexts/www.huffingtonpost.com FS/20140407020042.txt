{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week reminded us once again of the costs of accepting lowered expectations as the new normal. On Wednesday, a 5-4 Supreme Court decision struck down overall limits on campaign donations, further ceding our political system to the highest bidder in the guise of \"free speech.\" On the same day, Ft. Hood, Texas suffered its second mass shooting in five years, as a married father of four, in a fit of anger, killed four people, including himself, and wounded 16 others. Senator Harry Reid introduced a background checks bill the next day, but it will likely suffer the same fate as the one that failed last year even with the support of 90 percent of Americans. The week ended with yet another middling jobs report, with just 192,000 added in March. All three of these things should spark urgent calls for reform and change, because accepting them as the new normal only guarantees more of the same.Contrary to popular belief, the money-in-politics problem can be fixed by emulating the stunning successes of marriage equality and marijuana decriminalization over the past twenty years. Here\u0027s how to do it.Josh SilverDirector, Represent.UsWe strongly believe that it is time -- and not too late -- for the United States to apologize for the war in Iraq.Desmond TutuMpho TutuI admit it. It\u0027s true. I lie to the people running the food pantry. But before you get out your pitchforks and righteous indignation, before you diatribe about me \"abusing the system\" or taking advantage, please let me explain.Trisha LovetroveFreelance writer and bloggerWhen one considers the security situation, the threats made by the Taliban, and the miserable weather, the election result has been quite phenomenal. There is something immensely humbling to see groups of people holding up their dyed fingers, as much as to say \u0027Suck to you, Taliban!\u0027Duncan AndersonBritish academic based in Kabul working to help re-establish Afghan tertiary institutionsThe executives at GM knew for 13 years that their cars had a defective ignition switch that would, well, kill people. But they did a \"cost-benefit analysis\" and concluded that paying off the deceased\u0027s relatives was going to be cheaper than having to install a $10 part per car.Michael MooreOscar and Emmy-winning DirectorThis week begins the make-or-break, do-or-die standardized testing that will label your child a success or a failure. I urge you not to let your child take the state test. Opt out.Diane RavitchResearch Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027With Easter approaching, I have been thinking of our own secular god, William Shakespeare, whose life remains shrouded in mystery, not unlike that of Jesus.Robert David JaffeeAuthor, journalist and mental health activistIt was nice while it lasted. Democracy at the national level is dead now. We have replaced it with an open auction. This will not at some future date lead to a worst case scenario. We\u0027re already living in that scenario.Cenk UygurHost, \u0027The Young Turks\u0027You don\u0027t know me. You have no clue that my family has gone through the wringer. You have no clue that we have faced unbelievable hardship. You know none of this but you didn\u0027t let that stop you from being compassionate and generous to someone you have never met.Andrea GardnerMom, teacher, bloggerThese kinds of subtle connections, floated out in headlines, ledes and in repeated questions to experts in endless cable news coverage, result in reinforcement of stigma and a lost opportunity to educate viewers and readers on what mental illness and PTSD really are.Mark JoyellaEmmy Award-winning journalistThe \"free speech\" ostensibly being protected in this case wasn\u0027t the right of you and I to be heard, but the \"right\" of the wealthy to drown out everyone else\u0027s voices with their multimillion-dollar amplifiers.Marge BakerExecutive Vice President for Policy and Program, People For the American Way \u0026 People For the American Way FoundationRev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkWall Street banks have the right to express their views to lawmakers and regulators through lobbying, but the law is clear: If they want to influence lawmakers, they must disclose their lobbying expenditures.Sen. Elizabeth WarrenDemocratic Senator from MassachusettsEven when we do know all the details, until civilian law matches military law on guns, we unfortunately must brace ourselves for the possibility of more of these tragedies.Jon SoltzCo-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranThere is a place for privacy in loving, trusting relationships, and it\u0027s important to remember that a person\u0027s request for privacy doesn\u0027t mean he\u0027s up to no good. Similarly, putting your significant other on your shortlist of those with access to your info does not necessarily mean you have intimacy or connection.Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarEver since the crisis in Ukraine erupted, the oil and gas industry and its friends in Congress have been pushing exports of gas. This has nothing to do with lofty foreign policy objectives and everything to do with the oil and gas industry using a crisis to ram its agenda through Congress.Mark RuffaloWenonah HauterWhy can\u0027t everyone shut up about Obamacare? Because now the real problems will start to surface. People who thought their monthly premiums were too high may drop out and stop paying, thus losing their insurance. The lucky ones will end up on Fox complaining about it.Linda BergtholdHealth policy consultant and bloggerWe still must do more to extend opportunity to those who live on society\u0027s margins. With patience, persistence and partnership, we can create economic opportunity for every person willing to work hard for it.Thomas E. PerezU.S. Secretary of LaborOur desire to bring every good thing to our children is a force for good in the world.Melinda GatesKathy CalvinThe great political struggle we now face is whether the United States retains its democratic heritage or whether we move toward an oligarchic form of society where the real political power rests with a handful of billionaires, not ordinary Americans.Sen. Bernie SandersIndependent U.S. Senator from VermontI, too, went to Harvard, and years later (when I least expected it), I was raped. Ever since that day in April 2008 -- when I was pushed into the mud by a violent 15-year-old boy -- I\u0027ve been thinking a lot about how our society handles the problem of rape.Winnie M LiWriter, producerAnswers to this puzzle are more known than is generally appreciated. Taking an approach that identifies and addresses risk and protective factors in violence, whether it be directed against the self or others, is one thing we can do right now.Lloyd I. Sederer, MDMedical director, New York State Office of Mental HealthThis isn\u0027t about not holding myself accountable for my actions; it\u0027s about no longer reflexively blurting out an apology I don\u0027t really owe. It\u0027s about changing my default setting from unnecessary guilt.Ani VrabelDeputy blog editor, The Huffington PostIf you know that by getting to the front of the line you are able to see or anticipate some material number of the trades that are about to happen, you are GUARANTEED to make a profit. What is the definition of a rigged market? When you are guaranteed to make a profit.Mark CubanOwner, Dallas Mavericks; Chairman, AXS TVI\u0027ve been tweezing, shaving, moisturizing, defrizzing, flat-ironing, bikini-waxing, gym-joining (notice I said gym-joining, not gym-going?) exfoliating and manicuring since 8th grade, all while sleeping on a silk pillowcase to reduce wrinkles. I\u0027m ready to grow a beard and just RELAX.Anastasia BasilWriter. Worrier.George Takei\u0027s April Fools\u0027 Day prank was too good to be true. :(George TakeiSocial media starOur work certainly is not done, but with over 7 million people enrolling in Obamacare, we ought to be very proud of what we have accomplished. The legacy of this great president is growing by the day, as one who leads with compassion, tolerance and generosity with always a focus on equality.Russell SimmonsFounder, GlobalGrind.comThe continued conflict has forced millions of people from their homes with more than half of them being children. This disruption has adversely affected their daily lives, limiting access to food, water, health care and education.AkonPhilanthropist, Business Mogul, Five-Time Grammy Nominated ArtistShe\u0027s a model and a beauty pageant queen now.
