{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week saw the kickoff of Second Term Scandal Season, though the first entrants fall on very different parts of the manufactured scandal vs. real scandal continuum. On the deeply-contrived end is Benghazi -- with supposedly damning White House emails having been altered by GOP leakers. On the actually scandalous end is the administration\u0027s snooping through the AP\u0027s phone records, which the New York Times called \"an effort to frighten off whistle-blowers.\" The incident points out the hypocrisy of a White House that praises whistleblowers in the abstract, but then goes after them -- aggressively and often. \"Speaking truth to power is now a criminal act,\" says whistleblower and former NSA executive Thomas Drake, who the DOJ charged under the WW I-era Espionage Act. It\u0027s President Obama\u0027s war against whistleblowers that is the true scandal.Comments (148)Richard C. LevinPresident of Yale UniversityWe leave together. You leave Yale College after four years; I leave the Yale Presidency after twenty. I find myself thinking about a Grateful Dead song written in 1970, the year I came to Yale as a graduate student. You know the words: \"Lately it occurs to me, what a long, strange trip it\u0027s been.\" It\u0027s been a long trip, but, for us, more wonderful than strange.CommentsBarbra StreisandSinger; Actress; Director; Composer; ActivistSometimes in the face of national tragedy, politics should take a backseat. The hypocrisy of turning Benghazi into a deliberate cover-up scandal is preposterous at a time when the nation faces so many serious problems.Comments (1,436)Ricky GervaisActor, writer, comedian, director, producerI\u0027m proudest of the fact that it was just another experiment that got out of hand -- The Ricky Gervais Show Series Three was released on DVD this week. To celebrate this final chapter I thought I\u0027d tell the lovely readers of The Huffington Post the story of how we got here...Comments (76)Jamie Lee CurtisActress and children\u0027s book authorAngelina Jolie\u0027s revelation today, done with eloquence and dignity and grace, is remarkable both in its message and its import to the world of women. Pro-action.Comments (187)Tracy MorganActorGrowing up in the hood surrounded by a lot of poverty, music was one of the only things that made people feel good. That\u0027s why we need music and arts. We\u0027ve got to put instruments in young people\u0027s hands because that\u0027s the kind of thing that really touches the soul.Comments (98)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundOn this 50th anniversary of the Birmingham Children\u0027s Crusade it is a time to remember, honor, and follow the example of the children who were frontline soldiers and transforming catalysts in America\u0027s greatest moral movement of the 20th century.Comments (25)David BromwichProfessor of Literature at YaleDifferent as they are, the scandals all point to a single disorder that afflicts the Obama White House and the Holder justice department. The name of the disorder is paternalism, and its leading symptoms are suppression and secrecy.Comments (661)Salma Hayek PinaultActress, Co-founder of Chime for ChangeIn the information age, there are no innocent bystanders. We all share in everything that happens. But that means we also have the chance, the ability, and the responsibility, to right what is wrong. We can be defined not just by what we know, but by what we do.Comments (105)Jason AlexanderActorGood men and women in the Middle East are struggling for their futures, their dignities, and their security. We have a role to play, no matter how small. I have taken a part, but this cast is large. And the players need you. It is a great story. You really shouldn\u0027t miss it.Comments (314)Kate FlanneryActress, The OfficeEveryone keeps asking what I am going to do now that The Office is ending. I liberated myself on live radio by simply saying, \"I\u0027m gonna kill myself.\"Comments (70)Landon DonovanProfessional Soccer PlayerI recall distinctly the moment we received the news that my father had been diagnosed with skin cancer; it\u0027s not the kind of thing you forget easily. The bump on his eyelid that worsened quickly was more than just a bump, it was something that had the potential to change our lives.Comments (21)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarWhile men seem to welcome the existence of dual income households, and marriages marked by (mostly) shared responsibilities, there\u0027s a hitch: The guys still want to be the primary breadwinner. That is, she can bring home the bacon, so long as it\u0027s not all of it.Comments (281)Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoI am a card-carrying member of the ACLU, a strong proponent of press freedom and a staunch believer in both a robust First Amendment and a vibrant Fourth Amendment. But I also care about rational public discourse, and the furious condemnation of the Department of Justice in this situation is way over the top.Comments (477)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistAs an adult, it can be hard to meet new people and start new relationships -- especially after a divorce, after the kids are grown, after being laid off or becoming a widow. But it may not be as hard as you think to make new friends in mid-life and beyond.Comments (68)John KerryU.S. Secretary of StateOur warming planet means the Arctic\u0027s ecosystem is experiencing significant, rapid shifts with far-reaching consequences. All of the changes in the Arctic must change the way we approach the region.Comments (292)Christina HuffingtonIt\u0027s important for younger women to see that success does not prevent mental health issues and that mental health issues do not prohibit success.Comments (36)Sen. Kirsten GillibrandU.S. Senator from New YorkThe scourge of sexual violence in the military should be intolerable to all Americans and it\u0027s time to bring it to an end once and for all. We must commit ourselves not just to a zero tolerance policy, but we need to get to a point of zero occurrence.Comments (322)Raffi CavoukianTroubadour, AuthorImposters, predators and porn sites lurk in the shadows on the Information Superhighway and all too easily lure unsuspecting users. Can we regulate and inspire a digital code of conduct that rewards our highest inclinations and enables connecting for the greatest good?Comments (46)Bonnie TylerSinger, British entrant for the Eurovision Song Contest 2013So here we are: I\u0027m going to be flying the flag for the United Kingdom at the 58th Eurovision Song Contest this year in Malmo, Sweden. And what\u0027s more -- I am completely honoured to do it!Comments (81)Josh SilverDirector, Represent.UsWe have to create the conditions where politicians representing their constituents is \"normal.\" And even if we do, all politicians will not suddenly become enlightened. It just means we\u0027ll have a better chance that the actual needs of society will more frequently be met by the actions of its government.Comments (202)Sec. Kathleen SebeliusSecretary of Health and Human ServicesToday, for nearly the 40th time since it\u0027s been the law of the land, House Republicans staged yet another repeal vote in their latest attempt to turn back the clock on progress and deny Americans health insurance coverage they can count on.Comments (480)Leo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersRepublicans want to kill the government that accomplished that. They want to go back to Downton Abbey days. The rich stay rich; the poor stay servants.Comments (727)Diane LaneActressNeedless suffering and death can be avoided if women are invested in and valued culturally for more than just their reproductive capacity.Comments (28)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027Violence against women is the most prevalent and the most hidden injustice in our world today. It\u0027s time for all people of faith to be outraged. It\u0027s time for our Christian leaders to stand up and say that women, made in the very image of God, deserve better.Comments (149)Sen. Barbara BoxerU.S. Senator from California; Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works CommitteeEfforts to manufacture a controversy surrounding this tragedy are not only disingenuous, they are dangerous because they take our eye off the ball and divert attention from where it should be: protecting the American people and those who bravely serve our country overseas.Comments (1,314)Danny RubinManaging Editor, News To Live ByYou\u0027re halfway through the most formative decade of your life. You don\u0027t need all the answers, but you must keep asking questions. Start with this one: what\u0027s something new that I can learn right now?Comments (65)Maria Cuomo ColeLeading Advocate for the Homeless, Victims of Domestic Violence and At-Risk YouthOn this Mother\u0027s Day, it is hard not to feel inspired and hopeful by the robust and sophisticated grassroots movement building of moms across America who have organized to fight for safer gun law legislation.Comments (127)Mark E. Robson, M.D.Attending Physician, Clinic Director, Clinical Genetics Service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer CenterI have been involved in research in this area for 17 years, since shortly after BRCA1 and BRCA2 were discovered, and I have no idea what I would do if I were a woman faced with this decision. The diagnosis of a mutation is just words on paper, but the risks they foreshadow are very real.Comments (424)Rebecca SaxeAssociate Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience, MITCooperating in large groups is a signature accomplishment of the human brain: Among similar species, we are remarkably good at working together and negotiating our differences.Comments (207)Mike HoganExecutive Arts and Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post Media GroupWe have to start with the bear, right? That claw mark on Brienne\u0027s neck looked pretty fierce. She\u0027s gonna feel that in the morning. But I suspect the scar will always remind Jaime and Brienne of the ties that bind them.Comments (535)Jay Michaelson, 2013.19.05Jarrett L.
