{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week brought both the exhilaration of watching our country make progress on the road to a more perfect union, and the disappointment of watching it stumble back. On Tuesday, the misguided \"Don\u0027t Ask, Don\u0027t Tell\" policy officially ended, finally allowing gays and lesbians to openly serve in the military. A day later, the state of Georgia executed Troy Davis, a black man accused of killing a white police officer more than 20 years ago, despite what GOP Rep. Bob Barr called the conviction\u0027s reliance on \"the skimpiest of evidence,\" and, in the words of former FBI director William Sessions, \"pervasive, persistent doubts\" about Davis\u0027 guilt. The day after that, at the latest GOP debate, a gay soldier\u0027s question about DADT drew boos from the crowd and silence from the candidates, who returned to arguing over which of them is most opposed to government intrusion into the lives of citizens -- lethal injections aside, of course.Read Post | Comments (18)Nathaniel Frank, 9/20/11Author, \u0027Unfriendly Fire: How the Gay Ban Undermines the Military and Weakens America\u0027\"Don\u0027t ask, don\u0027t tell\" -- the policy and even the mere phrase -- says much about who we are as Americans. What we do in its wake will help shape what it means to be an American in the twenty-first century -- well beyond the rise and fall of this bizarre and convoluted law.Read Post | Comments (96)Alec Baldwin, 9/19/11ActorI want to take this opportunity to clarify why I did not attend last night\u0027s Emmy broadcast.Read Post | Comments (362)Arianna Huffington, 9/18/11While Obama\u0027s ideas about the changes the system needs in his second term are welcome and necessary, there is another kind of change he needs to talk about if he is to be believed. He needs to make clear the changes he intends to make in himself.Read Post | Comments (1,298)Marian Wright Edelman, 9/23/11President, Children\u0027s Defense FundWhat is our values compass as we seek solutions to rampant joblessness and poverty among millions of Americans, including 16.4 million poor children?Read Post | Comments (255)Robert Redford, 9/24/11Actor; Director; Environmental ActivistThe Keystone XL, as proposed, would run from Canada across the width of our country to Texas oil refineries and ports. It would carry diluted bitumen, a kind of crude oil, produced from the Alberta tar sands. I say this is a bad idea.Read Post | Comments (456)Maria Shriver, 9/23/11Emmy-winning journalist; Best-selling author; ActivistGet out and play tomorrow.

Why, if a husband can have a mistress, can his wife not have a mister? Not just a \"piece on the side,\" certainly not a gigolo, but a man with whom she shares a long-term, extramarital romantic and sexual relationship?Read Post | Comments (1,395)Kevin Smith, 9/22/11That fat guy who got thrown off the planeMy most cherished responsibility as a bona fide indie filmmaker is to let everyone know the shot is always worth taking.

By reconsidering their decision, the Board of Pardons and Paroles would demonstrate Georgia\u0027s commitment to upholding the law, and the principles of fairness and justice.Read Post | Comments (290)Mark Penn, 9/18/11CEO, Burson-MarstellerObama should be working as a president, not a candidate. He should be claiming the vital center, not abandoning it. And most of all, he should be bringing the country together rather than dividing it through class warfare.Read Post | Comments (1,715)Christy Turlington Burns, 9/20/11Model; Writer; Entrepreneur; Spokesperson; Advocate; FilmmakerThe UN GA provides a great opportunity to reflect on global leaders\u0027 commitments to a number of development challenges.

We\u0027ll keep it simple, and not even wander into the economics of it. Human beings make mistakes. Therefore, having humans run devices that can kill literally millions of people is a mistake. A bad idea.Read Post | Comments (413)Rep. Carolyn Maloney, 9/22/11U.S. Representative for New York\u0027s 14th DistrictThis President not only supports women and the issues that impact them on a daily basis, but puts policies in place to help women and their families thrive. Questioning his commitment is sadly misplaced.Read Post | CommentsJeffrey Sachs, 9/21/11Director, the Earth Institute, Columbia University; Author, \u0027The Price of Civilization\u0027Obama may be leaning against the right-wing juggernaut, but he is not changing its direction, only slightly blunting its force. He has already given in where it counts by agreeing with the Republicans in August to slash the core of the discretionary civilian budget.Read Post | Comments (511)Ann Pettifor, 9/23/11New economist; Author, \u0027The Economic Consequences of Mr. Osborne\u0027As mayhem breaks out on stock markets; as Eurozone banks freeze up; and as the global financial system approaches a frightening \u0027danger zone,\u0027 the champions of the globalised \u0027free market\u0027 are in search of a scapegoat.Read Post | Comments (173)Dan Rather, 9/22/11Host, \u0027Dan Rather Reports\u0027Why should we care about the plight of honeybees?
