{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, the nation waited in breathless anticipation for the expected announcement tomorrow that Jeb Bush is running for president. Bush, who seems more adept at raising money than votes (he hasn\u0027t gotten one since 2002, the year his brother called for \"regime change\" in Iraq), appears to be the Republican most capable of uniting the money wing of the party with the money wing of the party. If nothing else, Bush\u0027s extended run-up to actually running demonstrates how pointless and fake so much of campaign coverage is. And the \"process journalism\" doesn\u0027t stop after Election Day. On Friday, President Obama suffered a defeat on fast-track authority for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. But most of the coverage was over the political and procedural ins-and-outs rather than the effects of the bill itself. Too bad we can\u0027t contain the media\u0027s horse-race coverage to the exploits of American Pharoah.I\u0027ve been working on the ground in Haiti with people who are heroic to me. It has bred this reflection. What my eyes have seen make me grateful to them. What my eyes have seen make me grateful to the American Red Cross.Academy Award-winning actor; Ambassador-at-Large for HaitiIt\u0027s said Obama desperately wants this agreement as part of his \"legacy.\" Legacy? No, it\u0027s payback time to the big contributors to both parties. Legacy? Think Bill Clinton and NAFTA.Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanySenior writer, Moyers \u0026 Company on public TV. Senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.Actor, writer, director, producer, and comedianThe truth is that there\u0027s not a whole lot of hope for women-owned businesses to reach the same levels of impact and profitability as male-owned ones if standards of gender in the family don\u0027t also change, and significantly.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarWashington\u0027s determination to defend much of the globe has made the U.S. an international sucker, especially vulnerable to manipulation by supposed friends.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteParents should be able to send their children to the school of their choice, and they do; but the public should not be expected to pay for their private choices.Research Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027Some in Europe, especially in Germany, seem nonchalant about a Greek exit from the eurozone. The market has, they claim, already \"priced in\" such a rupture. Some even suggest that it would be good for the monetary union. I believe that such views significantly underestimate both the current and future risks involved.Professor at Columbia University and a Nobel Laureate in EconomicsA key aspect of the TPP will be the provision of \"investor-state dispute settlement\" (ISDS). The name sounds innocuous, but its content puts at risk core elements of the American legal system -- America\u0027s commitment to open courts and equal treatment.Professor of Law and Faculty Director, Global Health Justice Partnership, Yale Law SchoolArthur Liman Professor of Law, Yale Law SchoolFor the past 25 years, we\u0027ve acted as if we were becoming stronger in the world. We\u0027re not, and our foreign policy should reflect that.Author, \u0027Superpower: Three Choices for America’s Role in the World;Nobody of any age should be held in jail without a trial for three years. No child or adolescent should be held in an adult jail. Yet, a 16-year-old accused of stealing a backpack was kept in one of the most violent adult jails in the United States, Rikers Island in New York City, for three years without a trial.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundAs we take turns pushing her one-year-old brother in his stroller, my daughter asks me why people don\u0027t just stay away from bad people, then they won\u0027t be trafficked. I tell her that usually the story starts out with hope.Journalist + founder of ethical fashion shop, Good ClothThe timing of the encyclical\u0027s release, three months before the pope\u0027s visit to the U.S. and six months before the climate talks in Paris, shows that the Vatican is being quite strategic about maximizing its impact on the global political system. That is why those who most profit from the status quo have been among the most vocal in critiquing the pope before it has even appeared.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersForty-two Republicans, none of whom even bothered to speak in opposition, voted to continue discrimination, and my amendment was defeated. Some of those Republicans had previously voted for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, so they retreated from their earlier stand against workplace discrimination against LGBT Americans.U.S. Senator from New HampshireThe news of your death is heartbreaking. It has stirred my soul and inspired me to action. It is soul stirring because I refuse to let your death be in vain. I cannot, shall not and will not allow your story to go quietly away.Writer, mentor and motivational speakerAn anti-ISIS conference was held in Paris on June 2. The only armed forces that, so far, have stood up to the beheaders, the only ones capable of holding a front a thousand kilometers long, the only ones that have not yielded an inch of ground -- the Kurdish armed forces, the army of the Iraqi Kurds and its heroic Peshmerga -- were not invited.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.When blackness is conditioned into the psyche of a society as inherently bad, there is no such thing as children -- only blackness and the \"badness\" that comes with it. It is this ideology that leads adult white men -- police officers -- to use the kind of force we\u0027ve seen in the McKinney footage against black children.Author, blogger, and poet.Racism and bigotry can infect the fabric of a community, leading to a slow erosion of its democratic values and ideals. But what factors contribute to the rise of these judgments of character in the first place?Founder, GlobalGrind.comFar too often, people tell the story of what is happening today in Ukraine without you in it. It is East versus West. The Eurasian Union versus the European Union. Russia versus the EU or Russia versus the United States. In this telling, at best, the Ukrainian people get to choose one of these sides. At worst, a side is chosen for you.U.S. Permanent Representative to the United NationsIn September of 1919, nine decades before Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker prevailed in his contentious battle against public sector unions and emerged a conservative hero, a little-known Massachusetts governor named Calvin Coolidge faced a major labor dispute. It\u0027s instructive to compare how Coolidge and Walker galvanized their respective GOP bases.Currently at Revolution LLC; previously the White House, Huffington Post Media Group, and Obama for AmericaIn addition to picking the right coverage and taking advantage of preventive care and screenings, remaining healthy requires a daily commitment to take control of our own health with healthy eating and exercise.Senior Advisor to the President and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsSecretary of Health \u0026 Human Services (HHS)Defending tenure should mean owning it without embarrassment -- and also pressing against those forces that tend to make it a source of embarrassment. Tenured and tenure-track faculty could do better in both respects.Professor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027My truth is not yours, nor my female identity yours, either. But I have my truth and my female identity, and all I ask is that you respect mine as I respect yours. I have travelled through the world as a woman and been shaped by it, just not for as long as you.Executive Director, Gender Rights MarylandThere\u0027s only one candidate who so far has been either ignored or ridiculed by the majority of the American media during his entire campaign. He is a candidate with firm values and authentic determination. That candidate\u0027s name is Bernie Sanders -- and he could, and should, be the 45th President of the United States of America.Amateur writer, amateur musician, proud Dominican, proud progressive. Columbia University, Class of 2019.Just as Ariana Grande -- pop princess, wearer of cat ears -- revealed herself to the world as a self-possessed female standing up for other women, Beyoncé -- fierce, outspoken feminist, champion of equality -- told us her secret to flatter abs. It was a confusing day.Writer, Blogger, JournalistHistory shows the very opposite of progress when it comes to these democratic sovereignty-shredding and job-exporting corporate-driven trade treaties -- unless progress is referring to fulfilling the deepest wishes of runaway global corporations.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorWe assume a lot about people, and especially about their bodies. Maybe it somehow seems more reasonable to make assumptions about the things we can see. These women are my friends, my village, and they are willing to share their stories with you so that you may honor them.Feminist, body positive, wife, mom of five, Editor In Chief at ravishly.com, (sometimes) RN.96 percent of Americans agree that it is important to reduce the influence of money in elections. Just about the only people who disagree are five Supreme Court justices and the corrupt Congress who got elected through that money. Otherwise, real Republican, Democratic and independent voters all agree: If you take a lot of money from someone, you are likely to do what they ask you to do. This used to be called bribery.Host, \u0027The Young Turks\u0027Something is rotten in the state of Michigan. One city neglected to inform its residents that its water supply was laced with cancerous chemicals. Another dissolved its public school district and replaced it with a charter school system, only to witness the for-profit management company it hired flee the scene.Author, \u0027A Dream Foreclosed\u0027The evidence suggests that attracting a professional sports franchise to a city and building that franchise a new stadium or arena will have no effect on the growth rate of real per capita income and may reduce the level of real per capita income in that city.Executive Vice President, Cato Institute; Author, \u0027The Libertarian Mind\u0027 (2015)When someone dies it\u0027s such a private time and yet so very public. That\u0027s how I\u0027m feeling about the loss of my job.
