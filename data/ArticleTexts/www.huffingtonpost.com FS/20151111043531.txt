After the last debate, he was lampooned for not knowing the rate at which his own tax plan would tax people. But this is actually one of the things that makes Carson a strong candidate: his total disinterest in mere \"plans\" and \"policies.\" There\u0027s a lot more to life than what can be slowly ground through the House Appropriations Committee. What I\u0027d say to everyone who harps on Carson\u0027s lack of policy acumen as a reason to treat him as if he\u0027s not ready for primetime is: You are not looking at the Big Picture.

I do not believe in the use of violence. I am a young Palestinian woman who grew up under occupation and is trying to better my life through education. There are millions of women and girls like me. What about us? According to your article, we do not exist.Student, Kenyon CollegeThose who advocate the Open Carry of firearms in public have been telling us for some time that their goal is to \"normalize\" this behavior. On October 31, we learned the price of treating such threatening and dangerous behavior as normal, and it might have been three human lives.Executive Director, Coalition to Stop Gun ViolenceOn Tuesday, I\u0027ll be joining fast-food workers and other underpaid workers all across the country to demand higher wages and a voice on the job. We have a common fight, and when we stick together, we can win.Production worker, Lear CorporationWe have a presidential candidate saying that atheists shouldn\u0027t be president at an event that also included a man making a strange allusion or two to ancient prophets. Why does this matter in the context of either politics or religion?Theologian, cyclist, fatherYou might not be fully aware of it yet, but the evidence is all around us: humanity\u0027s impact upon planet Earth is now so profound that we are about to be recognized as a geological force of nature, right up there with the ice ages and the massive asteroid collision that wiped out the dinosaurs some 65 million years ago.Author, \u0027The Unconditioned Mind: J.

What churches don\u0027t get to do is determine who enters the vehicle.Doctoral Candidate, Womanist, Activist, Mormon, Scholar, Therapist, Seeker of truth, light, and fun!With Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders on the rise, the GOP is in desperate need of an electable candidate. But as the field narrows to eight presidential hopefuls, the odds of finding a winner continue to worsen. Here are the 8 biggest challenges facing the 8 leading conservatives.Reddit-famous analyst, storyteller \u0026 filmmakerIt doesn\u0027t make you Satan to purchase coffee from a place that doesn\u0027t celebrate Christmas, if that\u0027s even the point they are trying to make.

Officially, more and more countries had committed themselves to diversity, multiculturalism, and the cosmopolitan ideals of liberty, solidarity, and equality. But everything began to change.Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogPeople of color can\u0027t be the only ones protesting racial injustice. I remember after the deaths of Mike Brown and Eric Garner, tears sprang to my eyes as I saw many white people taking to the streets to protest. As a black woman, that\u0027s not something I feel everyday.Journalist based in OsloThat desire to be boasted about online isn\u0027t his responsibility to satiate, because at the end of the day, it\u0027s just irrational envy.
