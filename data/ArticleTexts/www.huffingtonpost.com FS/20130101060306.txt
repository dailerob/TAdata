{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Happy New Year, HuffPosters! May your 2013 be filled with love, laughter, passion and 365 full nights of sleep. Through the years, I\u0027ve discovered something about New Year\u0027s resolutions: while it\u0027s not so easy to keep them, it\u0027s very easy to make them for other people. And a lot more fun, too. So here are some New Year\u0027s resolutions I\u0027d like to hear assorted public figures make and keep: \"I\u0027ll find better uses for my $150 million than trying to buy an election.\" ~ Sheldon Adelson. “I will stop endlessly repeating in your brain. Eventually.\" ~ The \"shine bright like a diamond\" refrain from Rihanna\u0027s \"Diamonds (In the Sky)\". \"I will finally quit making excuses and coming up with crazy ideas, like armed guards at every school, and admit that guns really do kill people, and lots of them.\" ~ NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre.Read Post | Comments (257)Robert Reich, 12/31/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The deal emerging from the Senate is a lousy one. Let me count the ways.Read Post | Comments (306)Marty Kaplan, 12/31/12Director, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolSome day not all that far in the future, a new kind of entertainment is going to be perfected that will either be the coolest video game ever, or the media equivalent of a lethal man-made super-virus.Read Post | Comments (52)Mohamed A. El-Erian, 12/31/12CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOSome were willing to settle for a \"mini bargain.\" Instead Congress seems now to be working on a \"micro deal.\"Read Post | CommentsRobert Kuttner, 12/30/12Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Obama wanted to be the president who would change the tone in Washington, meaning a more collaborative relationship with the Republicans. That was not to be. The Republicans would not allow it.Read Post | Comments (703)Michael Moore, 12/31/12Oscar and Emmy-winning directorNo. 4: Stop saying, \"I support the troops.\" I don\u0027t. I used to. No. 5: Apologize for No. 4.Read Post | Comments (100)Howard Fineman, 12/30/12Editorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupI\u0027m headed back to Washington knowing what I had guessed when I left town: that the so-called fiscal cliff \"talks\" would still be going when I got home. I\u0027m returning with useful, nagging questions ringing in my ears from Kiwis and visitors alike.Read Post | Comments (1,214)Paul Brandeis Raushenbush, 12/31/12Senior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostI turned to some religious leaders on Huffington Post and asked them to share their hopes for the coming year. May they inspire you as they have inspired me.Read Post | Comments (142)David Wild, 12/31/12TV Writer; Contributing Editor, Rolling Stone; Co-Author, \u0027Diary of a Player\"\u0027Rather than offer any grand resolutions that won\u0027t clear or share my ignorant perspective on life on the Fiscal Cliff, here\u0027s an eclectic playlist for this New Year\u0027s Eve.Read Post | Comments (59)Nathan Newman, 12/31/12NYU Information Law Institute FellowThe real measure of the radicalism of Les Miserables is not in the character of the heroes or the evils visited upon them, but in that of the movie\u0027s villain, Inspector Javert. Read Post | Comments (84)Michael Roth, 12/31/12President, Wesleyan UniversitySacks has turned hallucinations from something bizarre and frightening into something that seems part of what it means to be a person. His book, too, is a medical and human triumph.Read Post | CommentsLynn Forester de Rothschild, 12/31/12CEO of EL RothschildFor so many years, and in so many ways, she has touched our hearts and changed our lives. Maybe now we can come together to say a prayer that will bring her back to good health.Read Post | Comments (21)Dr. Reese Halter, 12/31/12Broadcaster and BiologistI firmly believe that our species has begun to reunite economics and ecology for a sustainable future. Here are just a few examples of environmental triumphs that we can all celebrate from 2012.Read Post | CommentsJill Brooke, 12/29/12Playwright, \"What\u0027s Eating You?\"; Author, \"Don\u0027t Let Death Ruin Your Life\"In reflecting on all the people who passed away this year, I am thinking of Nora Ephron and how this witty, wise and loving woman taught us not only how to live but also how to die.Read Post | Comments (60)Christopher Elliott, 12/31/12Author of the book Scammed: How to Save Your Money and Find Better Service in a World of Schemes, Swindles and Shady DealsThere\u0027s something about travel -- whether you\u0027re flying, driving or sailing -- that brings out the jerk in all of us. Like the guy in seat 26B just in front of me right now on a flight from Honolulu to Los Angeles, who is probably a nice guy on the ground. But put him on a plane, and shortly after takeoff, he jams his seat into my knees without so much as an apology.Read Post | Comments (62)Kevin Bacon, 12/31/12ActorI\u0027m setting six New Year\u0027s resolutions that celebrate help, hope and humor. We can all use a little more of these qualities for 2013.Read Post | Comments (27)Carla Buzasi, 12/29/12Carla Buzasi is editor-in-chief of The Huffington Post UKWhen I wrote my end of year blog last December, in my infinite wisdom, I\u0027m fairly sure I declared it the Year of News, impossible to surpass... However, if 2011 kept news editors across the world on their toes, I think it\u0027s fair to say 2012 certainly rose to the challenge.Read Post | CommentsScott Goodstein, 12/31/12Founder of Revolution MessagingLost in all the punditries of 2013 about which groups helped win the presidency in our evolving electorate, we are missing the importance of not just the changing demographics, but a seismic shift in how Americans digest news and information.Read Post | CommentsJared Bernstein, 12/30/12Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorIf Senators McConnell and Reid hammer out a budget deal that can pass their caucuses, Rep. Boehner is likely to take it up in the House. If it passes there, the president will presumably sign it before the ball drops in Times Square. We will have avoided going over the fiscal cliff, but at what cost?Read Post | Comments (207)Bill Nye, 12/29/12The Science Guy, Partner to SOPHIA.orgRight away, everyone wants to know what\u0027s to be cut. Whatever you all settle on cutting, it should not be science. Investment in science is investment in innovation. New ideas are what keep the U.S. economy driving forward.Read Post | Comments (231)Douglas Anthony Cooper, 12/31/12Novelist, Amnesia (See: Blogger Mortis)The gun lobby is not only uninterested in mental health care, but I assure you: they can be counted on to resist any real efforts to improve it.Read Post | Comments (150)Rev. Joan R. Harrell, 12/31/12Director of Public Communications, Trinity United Church of Christ; Host and Producer, \u0027Empowering Voices\u0027One hundred and fifty years later, African American Christians continue the faith tradition of their enslaved ancestors and gather at a designated meeting space, the church, tonight, Dec. 31, 2012, to celebrateRead Post | CommentsEric Boehlert, 12/30/12Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaThe grand experiment of marrying a political movement around a cable TV channel was a grand failure in 2012. But there\u0027s little indication that enough Republicans will have the courage, or even the desire, to break free from Fox\u0027s firm grip on the party.Read Post | Comments (240)Jeffrey Sachs, 12/29/12Director, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \u0027The Price of Civilization\u0027If the deal is reached, the Republicans have won: they have locked in a federal tax system that collects so little total federal revenue that government can afford almost nothing aside from the military, interest payments, retirement programs and health care.Read Post | Comments (1,060)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 12/29/12Author, research psychologist and gender scholarPerspectives impact rulings. Understanding other lives is not the forte of homogeneous groups. I am not talking about symbolic diversity. I am not talking about role models and success stories. I am talking about bringing a kind of life perspective to our political representation that will not find its way there on its own.Read Post | Comments (306)Robert Creamer, 12/29/12Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersIf your tax bill goes up $2,200 a year, or you\u0027re one of the millions who would stop receiving unemployment benefits, the cause of your economic pain is Republican fear of being beaten in a primary by people like Sarah Palin, Sharon Angel or Richard Mourdock.Read Post | Comments (344)Sandip Roy, 12/29/12Culture editor, Firstpost.com; editor, New America MediaShe had no intention to be a braveheart. She didn\u0027t want to become a flickering candle on some dark street corner. She didn\u0027t want to become a symbol. She just wanted to go home. Perhaps tell a friend what she thought of the movie she had just seen.Read Post | Comments (147)James Zogby, 12/29/12President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027As President Obama prepares to launch his second term in the White House, he can take some comfort in the fact that positive attitudes toward the United States have once again risen sharply in several Arab countries.Read Post | Comments (189)Ada Vassilovski, 12/31/12Vice President of Product Strategy and Marketing, MyMove.comThis year, instead of purchasing that expensive gym membership only to bail come February, commit to improving your home. The following four resolutions will help make your house a more functional, appealing and stress-free place to call home in 2013.Read Post | CommentsDeepak Chopra, 12/31/12Co-author, \u0027Super Brain: Unleashing the Explosive Power of Your Mind to Maximize Health, Happiness, and Spiritual Well-Being\u0027; founder, The Chopra FoundationNo one doubts that social networking produces results in politics, from the Arab Spring to the 2012 election, where President Obama\u0027s ground game made the difference. It could change everything, but the way forward is far from clear. What\u0027s at stake is huge.Read Post | CommentsRick Elice, 12/29/12Theater WriterAs if on cue, Tom asks us all into the sunroom.
