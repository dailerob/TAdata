{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Former Executive Editor Of Global Spirituality and Religion, The Huffington PostLatinos/Immigrants/Queers proclaiming pride in who they are, in who God made them to be -- dancing with their hands raised as bullets sprayed, and the pulse faded and was gone. Devastation. Desolation. Grief. At least 50 heartbeats that will never revive. Their beautiful lives now merely ammunition, wood to fuel a destructive fire of recriminations, division and hatred that will consume our nation. We have a love crisis in our country. Our heart isn\u0027t beating right. Our arteries are clogged with clots of distrust and hate. The devil smiles as tears scald, burn, and slice. Queer lives are vanquished and points are scored. We have a love crisis in this country. Love is a scarce commodity.Today I am sad. I am sad for Orlando. I am sad for the world. I am sad for humanity. I am sad that this beautiful country I have moved to and called my home for the past few years is seeing a day so ugly. I am sad that sides of beds will be left empty and cold. I am sad that some phones will keep ringing with no answer or calls back. Ever.Model and LGBT ActivistI have one message for those families in Florida: I am sorry. I am so, so sorry. I am sorry that our tragedy here in Sandy Hook wasn\u0027t enough to save your loved ones.Founder \u0026 Director, The Ana Grace ProjectWarren will get the nod if and only if Clinton decides that Warren will make a major difference in November. Would Warren take the job? Yes.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The fact that ISIS capitalizes on this hatred should not surprise us. But it would be tragic if the terrorist organization became the tree that hides the homophobic forest.Writer and DirectorAfter the Pulse nightclub massacre, there will be the customary vigils, speeches, and rainbow processions, vows of solidarity, and then the predictable return to business as usual. I am left wondering, amid all the prayers and mourning, wherein lies the responsibility and who is to blame?Trans researcher, mother, writer, and activist.This is what you do when it all goes to hell again. You watch the president call the massacre an act of terror and an act of hate. You learn this is the fifteenth time a mass murder has required him to console us. You cannot help thinking it\u0027s not the last time he will have to do it.USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorNewt Gingrich\u0027s supposed smartness is rather indiscriminate, when examined closely. Newt has what he considers 10 or 12 brilliant ideas each day, which he is in the habit of just tossing out for discussion.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comIf you are at all like me, you woke up Sunday morning to the horrific story out of Orlando, Florida that rocked you to the core. Many Americans are left wondering how we can process the grief, frustration, fear and anger that washes over us every time there is a senseless attack on innocent people in our country. The sad fact is we simply do not have the tools or the tests to predict who is or is not going to commit an act of violence. But, what we can do is work to prevent the senseless acts from happening by being more situationally aware.Author, Host \"Dr. Phil\"America is a big country and needs a big president. America needs a president with a big brain, capable of understanding complex constitutional, international and economic issues. Donald Trump is too small to be that man.International President, United SteelworkersThis is precisely what terrorists, extremists and groups like ISIS want -- division. We cannot succumb to such fear and disunity; we must remain vigilant in our will to stop any and all acts of terrorism, and denounce both homophobia and Islamophobia. This is a moment where we are being tested, and we cannot fail by answering hate with more hatred.President, National Action NetworkYou are the latest generation and you are, whether you are yet aware of it or not, charged with saving our Union.Documentary FilmmakerAt this point, it\u0027s our fault. It\u0027s our fault for listening to hollow promises made by people who have no intention of doing anything. It\u0027s our fault for believing the spin from this side or that side. It\u0027s our fault for becoming desensitized to mass shootings.JournalistLet\u0027s start by calling for a full-on permanent ban on weapons like the AR-15, guns that were designed to do exactly what they did, in Orlando, in Aurora, in Newtown, in San Bernadino, in Umpqua.Filmmaker, Brave New FilmsToday, it is our obligation as a queer community to remember that islamophobia, homophobia, and transphobia work together.Genderqueer advocate, movement organizer, and part-time fashion iconFrance was resilient and steadfast following the 2015 attacks, and the United States will be resilient now.U.S. Ambassador to the French Republic and the Principality of MonacoAmerican citizens face an enormous responsibility right at home. The undermining of functioning democracy is one of the contributions of the neoliberal assault on the world\u0027s population in the past generation. In Europe, the impact may be even worse.Institute Professor emeritus, MIT Department of Linguistics and Philosophy; Author, \u0027Who Rules the World?\u0027Jingoistic rhetoric is easy when you\u0027re on the outside. When you are the one who actually has to make the decisions about military deployments and to anticipate dealing with the unpredictable consequences, anyone will move with a measure of caution. Hillary is more likely to stumble into a war than calculatingly start one.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghI awoke this morning to news of the shooting in Orlando. The deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. My brother is not safe. My son is not safe. Even if they find their people. Because monsters can find them there, too.Mother of two, wife, blogger and author, \u0027Raising My Rainbow\u0027In the rough and tumble of presidential campaigns -- rougher this year than ever before -- facts are sometimes lost in the debate. But one fact that voters should keep in mind is that the U.S. economy performs better under Democratic presidents than Republican ones.U.S. Representative for New York\u0027s 12th District; Ranking Democrat, Joint Economic CommitteeThe LGBTQ community has been one of the foremost allies with Muslims in almost every sector. In some ways, we are indebted to their bravery and solidarity.#MuslimUniversityChaplain • Chicken-Fried Muslim • Interfaith Scholar • TEDx Speaker • NFL \u0026 NBA Lover • VP-National Association of College and University Chaplains • @AdeelJZebDonald Trump\u0027s success in the U.S. is not unique. Europe is being buffeted by similar populist currents. Illiberal, nationalist governments rule Hungary and Poland. Austria nearly elected a right-wing nationalist as president. Anti-EU leftists share power in Portugal.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteThere are so many marginalized people that have been and will be touched by this tragedy and for this reason it is crucial that we frame our conversations considering all of the intersecting identities of the people affected.Writer, Intersectional Feminist, History Buff, and Film loverWhen Leah and I were headed to the movies recently, I asked her who her favorite hero was. Waiting to hear the usual superhero response, Leah laughed and said, \"You\u0027re my favorite hero, daddy! Because you\u0027ve always saved the day.\" I smiled.Defensive End for the NFL Houston TexansEven to the casual observer, the semi-automatic 5.56mm AR-15 looks like it belongs solely in the hands of a soldier or police specialist rather than in closets or under beds of inner-city apartments or family homes in the outer-burbs.Writer and Director of Public Affairs at the NSW Minerals CouncilThere is something about the Trump candidacy that tells us we are in uncharted territory. While no president can possibly be prepared for the job, he brings lack of preparation to a new level.Executive Director, Columbia University\u0027s Earth InstituteThere is never a good time for it, but especially right now, when our country has just experienced an act of pure evil, I fail to understand how Meg Ryan\u0027s face merits coverage at all.Senior Editor, The Huffington PostEnough is enough kowtowing to the Americans who cling to their weapons for dear life. Enough is enough social media activism without any real calls to action. Enough is enough.Full-time traveler and writer, blogging at TheLitmoLife.comWhatever complaints one might have about the economic policies favored by Democrats over the last 50 years, no one outside the American Enterprise Institute and Paul Ryan\u0027s office seriously believes that Republican economics have been better for the white working-class.Author/Professor, Miami University, Oxford, OhioHate crimes against this community haven\u0027t disappeared just because courts, political leaders and businesses now support expanded rights. We must remain vigilant against the threat of violence, but we must also speak out against a climate of bigotry and hatred that rejects or devalues LGBTQIA rights, the rights of women, African-Americans, Muslims or any other groups in our diverse society.President, National Organization for WomenThe South African Supreme Court of Appeal\u0027s unanimous decision to find Oscar Pistorius guilty of murder by overturning a lower court\u0027s verdict of culpable homicide has important implications for the country\u0027s judicial system.The Conversation Africa is a news and analysis website which is a collaboration between academics and journalists.Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
