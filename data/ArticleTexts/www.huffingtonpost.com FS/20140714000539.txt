{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, the spotlight remained on immigration, with President Obama requesting $3.7 billion to deal with the flood of undocumented children crossing the border. As Speaker Boehner fixated on suing the President for delaying the same insurance mandate Boehner has tried to repeal, Glenn Beck announced plans to deliver food, water and toys to the children being held at the border, and the Wall Street Journal denounced the \"extreme voices\" arguing for impeachment, which included Sarah Palin. When the Journal calls out extremists and Glenn Beck is your voice of reason and compassion, you know the Republicans are in more disarray than the Brazilian soccer team\u0027s defense. Speaking of which, as Germany faces Argentina in the World Cup final, it\u0027s a day of split loyalties for the Vatican. Does God side with Argentine Pope Francis or German Pope Emeritus Benedict in this Papal Playoff? Maybe the CIA\u0027s newly discovered German double agent has the inside scoop.Every one of us in the Western world has contributed to climate change. We drive, fly, cool, heat. Perhaps we draw pensions from funds that back Exxon and Shell. On and on it goes, since fossil fuel is knit into the fabric of our society. If, as the Times puts it, Tom Steyer is \"shadowed by coal,\" so are the rest of us.Author of a dozen books, including \u0027The End of Nature\u0027 and \u0027Deep Economy\u0027Have you ever wondered about the amazingly effective campaign to sell the Common Core standards to the media, the business community, and the public? How did it happen that advocates for the standards used the same language, the same talking points, the same claims, no matter where they were located?Research Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027Each new day offers a new experience and a new chance to try something different. It is refreshing, but it is also innocent and child-like. But there is little that is truly new and different and the circularity of human experience gives fate the opportunity to come back and bite us.United States Senator (Ret.)Summertime reading recommendations are usually about escapism -- mysteries, thrillers, melodramas, romances -- meant to stand in for vacations from our everyday lives. But I\u0027d like to add a different sort of book to your summer reading queue. While it\u0027s not escapism, it is about a departure from our everyday work lives.The never-ending war in Iraq and the birth of the newly declared Islamic State -- the first caliphate since the fall of the Ottoman Empire -- are the unintended consequences of a set of crudely forged intelligence documents we collectively call The Italian Letter.Author, \u0027The Italian Letter: The Forgery That Started The Iraq War\u0027Once upon a time, if a character on TV or in a movie tortured someone, it was a sure sign that he was a bad guy. Now, the torturers are the all-American heroes. We\u0027re not only living in a post-9/11 world, we\u0027re stuck with Jack Bauer in the 25th hour.Author, \u0027Mainstreaming Torture\u0027Have you ever paused and asked the simple question: Where do we go from here? None of you -- Bennett, Haniyeh, Netanyahu, Meshal, and Abbas -- know what will be the fate of Israel and Palestine in five or 10 years should you continue to pursue your bankrupt policy.Senior Fellow, NYU\u0027s Center for Global AffairsThe world is aflame with new or intensifying conflicts. At first glance, these upheavals appear to be driven by their own idiosyncratic circumstances. But look more closely and they share several key characteristics -- notably, a witch\u0027s brew of ethnic, religious, and national antagonisms that have been stirred to the boiling point by a fixation on energy.Author and Professor of Peace and World-Security Studies, Hampshire CollegeMake them feel part of something bigger. Let them know you will be there for them. Remember words that have become the Márquez-Greene family\u0027s motto: \"Love Wins.\" And work without ceasing for common sense gun safety measures to stop the scourge of violence in America.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundToday, Washington is filled with routine proposals for new interventions: bombing campaigns, foreign invasions, and military occupations. Most seem unlikely to trigger a new world war. But a century ago no one expected an assassination in a distant Balkan province to do so either. That is reason enough for Americans to make war truly a last resort.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteThe top five oil and gas companies alone made over $1 trillion in the past decade. That\u0027s over $250 million per day. The fossil fuel industry is destroying the planet with impunity and getting rich while doing it. That must end.Independent U.S. Senator from VermontOur relationship used to be a give and take. But from now on, this relationship is a one-way street. I own you for all the great things you can bring my life, but you don\u0027t own me in return. I will look up. I will stop. I\u0027ve got to re-engage in the world instead of feeling engaged to you.Emmy® award-winning journalist and “Talk Stoop” hostWhat if you heard that other fishermen were unintentionally catching large numbers of vulnerable marine animals like dolphins, whales, and sea turtles -- damaging gear and hurting their own bottom lines? Waste on this scale occurs every day in many U.S. fisheries, hurting both fishermen and marine life.Actor; board member, OceanaCEO, OceanaThey couldn\u0027t find anything for the DTaP vaccine or the HIB vaccine. They couldn\u0027t find any association with autism. And they couldn\u0027t find any risk from giving a lot of vaccines at once; in fact, one study found that getting several vaccines may help protect children against leukemia.Pediatrician, Boston Children\u0027s Hospital, Harvard Medical SchoolThey never tell you in teacher school, and it\u0027s rarely discussed elsewhere. It is never, ever portrayed in movies and tv shows about teaching. Teachers rarely bring it up around non-teachers for fear it will make us look weak or inadequate.Teacher, writer, blogger at curmudgucationA just war must have a just end, and the just end must be sufficiently good to more than compensate for all injustices caused by the war. There is no plausible story that Netanyahu\u0027s war is a just war.Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicyMy mom would always say there\u0027s a simple fix for making someone feel included and showing respect -- it\u0027s as easy as using a different word.Actress, Special Olympics AmbassadorThe ability for ordinary working people to organize and collectively bargain over their wages and working conditions is a fundamental human right. It is a right just as critical to a democratic society as the right to free speech and the right to vote. Over the last 30 years many in corporate America and the big Wall Street banks have conducted a sustained attack on that human right.Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersI know what it\u0027s like to lose your childhood to war. When I was five and conflict raged in Sudan, my family and I were amongst the lucky ones to leave for Egypt. Four years later we were granted asylum in the United Kingdom. Inspired by legendary South Sudanese basketball player Manute Bol, my siblings and I took up basketball which helped us fit in. Like Manute, I was lucky enough to turn the sport I loved into a career as a professional NBA player in the United States.NBA and Great Britain basketball player, founder of the Luol Deng FoundationI\u0027ve worked with children and their parents across two continents and two decades, and what I\u0027ve seen in recent years alarms me. Here are the greatest problems, as I see them.Author of Keep Calm and Parent OnAlthough news headlines often glibly refer to a \"war on women\" in political terms, policymakers might well devote more energy to sex trafficking -- a nightmarish war faced by the most vulnerable among us, young women who are being bought and sold for sex against their will.U.S. Senator for the State of MississippiLike everyone, appearing smart during meetings is my top priority. Sometimes this can be difficult if you start daydreaming about your next vacation, your next nap, or bacon. When this happens, it\u0027s good to have some fallback tricks to fall back on.Smart satire for the Internet set. Comedian and creator of Conquering Corporate AmericaCompanies spend millions of dollars to make their products look ideal to consumers. But what if they stripped all of that away and told the truth?Graphic DesignerWhen I was holding her in those last moments as her breaths slowed, her eyes, which had half shut and glazed, suddenly opened, focused on me and then beyond me.Executive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostAlmost every mother I know lost her shame at the hospital, and it\u0027s a darn good thing because you can\u0027t afford to have much of it when you\u0027re a mom.Blogger, Pile of BabiesIf you have a fear of flying, don\u0027t. The data are very clear: If you have to travel someplace, the safest way is by airplane. The increase in sensors, materials science and design capabilities are giving us a world where we are safer.Chairman/CEO, XPRIZESo there it was... this input field with a pulsating cursor, waiting for me to type a password that I\u0027ll have to re-enter for the next 30 days. Then, letting all the frustration go, I remembered a tip I heard from my former boss. I\u0027m gonna use a password to change my life.Associate Creative Director, EF Education FirstBeing disabled doesn\u0027t automatically make you a noble inspiration to all humanity, says Stella Young. In this very funny talk, she breaks down society\u0027s habit of turning disabled people into \"inspiration porn.\"\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"Be smart about your smartphone use. See the phone for what it is: a tool for communication and for information. It doesn\u0027t define you, make you more appealing to others, nor should it rule your life.Licensed psychotherapist, executive coach, columnist, and author of \"Be Fearless: Change Your Life in 28 Days\"As a group fitness instructor and health coach, I am often asked the same questions: What do you do to stay fit? What do you eat? How often do you exercise and what do you do? If you are confused as to what\u0027s healthy, you are not alone.National fitness expert, speaker, contributor to Prevention magazine, author of several books and fitness DVDsGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"CHAMPIONS OF THE WORLD",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
