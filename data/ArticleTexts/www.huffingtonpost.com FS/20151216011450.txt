{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Jeff Bezos, the CEO and founder of Amazon, is routinely touted in the media as an entrepreneurial genius. That assessment may well be correct. After all, Amazon has made huge breakthroughs not only in Internet marketing, but also in promoting the spread of e-books, and more recently as a new source of television shows. But however brilliant Bezos may be, the public should recognize that his success has come with a huge helping hand from the taxpayers. He has received in the neighborhood of $4 billion in subsidies from taxpayers over the last two decades to help his business grow. If you missed that line item in the budget, it\u0027s probably because the media have mostly chosen not to give it much attention.Gretchen Rubin\u0027s new book, out today, is Better Than Before: What I Learned About Making and Breaking Habits -- to Sleep More, Quit Sugar, Procrastinate Less, and Generally Build a Happier Life. In answer to my questions, she shared her insights on how habits can free us, the importance of understanding ourselves, and the 21 strategies we can use to make or break habits -- and in doing so, begin to live the lives we want, not the lives we settle for.Sheldon Adelson means not only to pick the Republican nominee, but to dictate his thoughts. Perhaps the most important subtext to Tuesday\u0027s contest is who emerges as the leading alternative to the toxic Donald Trump or the rising hard-right appeal of Ted Cruz. And as to this, there is no single factor more important than the verdict of Sheldon Adelson.Novelist and contributing opinion writerAfter the civil rights achievements of the 1960s, it was widely assumed that tolerance and diversity would win the day. This recent spasm of hatred is shocking in its intensity and in the apparent rejection of that decades-long progress toward social peace. Many even call it fascism. Why has this reversal suddenly appeared?Executive Director, MIT Center for International StudiesBecause so few women have employer-provided retirement benefits or personal savings on which to rely, Social Security is disproportionately their sole source of income in old age. For 49 percent of never-married, divorced and widowed women aged 65 and older, Social Security comprises virtually all of their income. That is nearly one out of two single women!Founding Co-director, Social Security WorksPresident, National Organization for WomenIt is time for presidential debate moderators to get real about Latinos. In the real world, Latinos are not the other. Sixty-five percent of us were born in the United States. We are your friends and neighbors.Co-Chair of Latino Donor Collaborative, Fmr. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and Founder and Chairman of CityViewCo-Chair of Latino Donor Collaborative, Fmr. Chairman and CEO of USWEST and Fmr. CEO of Orange and CEO of TelstraDespite the dangers of living in the modern world, despite understandable anger and fear, courageous people know that life beyond the headlines retains its capacity for joy, love, safety, and friendship.Sass \u0026 SensibilityFormer Senator and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel is a very busy man with a portfolio of weighty foreign policy issues for which he advocates. You might think, in fact, that his focus on international affairs would preclude him from weighing in on just about everything else.Executive Director, Issue OneI am guessing this is probably not the last time I will say the wrong thing, or say something the wrong way. I promise to keep learning, and to try to be more articulate in the future. We have a lot of hard work to do. I am looking forward to doing it together.Public speaker, activist, OlympianThe only certainty in regard to the elections next Sunday is that on Monday, a new political era will begin in Spain. Farewell to the absolute majorities and to the monochrome governments -- Hello to negotiation and agreement.Editorial Director, El Huffington PostFemale representation in Arab countries has risen by 13 percentage points, surpassing Pacific nations this past year. That\u0027s quadruple the growth rate of Nordic countries, which have consistently elected a higher percentage of women to parliament over the last 15 years.Vocativ - news sourced from the deep web.To those who are still upset that campus carry became law, realize that it was because state legislators thought it was in our best interest, even though we made it very clear that we really did not want this. If there\u0027s anything to take from the passing of campus carry, it\u0027s that elections matter.University of Texas Student Body president, former NFL starUniversity of Texas Student Body Vice President, Good BoyThe truth is that Muslim Americans are not only integrating into U.S. society, but are actually more opposed to violence and more tolerant in many ways than many other Americans.Director of Immigration Policy, Niskanen CenterResearch Associate at the Niskanen CenterThe \"crazy\" is everywhere. The question is whether, after the fear subsides, the varying political forces will return to \"business as usual\" as if nothing fundamental has changed in French politics.Editorial Director, Le Huffington PostBecause my Iranian-born parents automatically passed down their nationality on to me through jus sanguinis laws and I am an Iranian-American dual national, now I\u0027m uncertain if freely traveling to see my family will be a possibility due to the recent passage of a discriminatory House billSamira is currently pursuing a masters in Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Oxford. She was born and raised in Los Angeles.I want to see you find yourself. I want to see you find the place where you fit within the community. I am concerned about where you are now. But I am even more interested in who you will grow into.Director of Advocacy, SPARTAThe media arts are a field that I see as having immense potential to shape a new generation of students around the world that are breaking down cultural boundaries and seeing in one another our common humanity. The Global Lives Project has emerged in the past few years as an ideal educational tool to do just this.Journalism/English teacherThe proposed program reforms will curtail tourism, business and scholar-related travel (and hurt US economic interests as well), but will do almost nothing to address the real weaknesses of the surveillance-watchlisting process used to cross-check visa and visa waiver applicants.Former FBI Special AgentI believe that people who are born into Islam are entitled to the same human rights as the rest of us, including the rights to leave that faith and speak of their own experience without being branded some sort of racist native informant.Writer, layabout and all-around nogoodnik; Founder, Grub Street; former Associate News Editor, The Huffington PostElection 2016 is already an eye-popping spectacle. No wonder, then, that television news, profiting so from the expanding election season, would anoint it as a new kind of 24/7 entertainment event.Editor, TomDispatch.comVoters, who worry about paying their bills, don\u0027t want their Social Security benefits messed with. And, they certainly don\u0027t want their health care costs to go up. Older voters who are 75 years of age and over are equally nervous, if not terrified, of these changes.Organizer, Social Security WorksIf the Fed raises interest rates for the first time since the Great Recession, they will effectively be declaring \"mission accomplished\" on jobs and wages. But there is a major issue: The data simply does not support a rate hike.Dean of the US House of Representatives | Ranking Member, House Judiciary CommitteeThe Democrats ultimate hope in 2016 is that Hillary can combine foreign policy and terrorism toughness with an economic message of fairness for the middle class. A Republican who can pivot and pre-empt that argument will give her fits.Senior Fellow, DemosThe drug war affects millions around the world. It impedes the right to health of both drug users and the wider community, it restricts scientific and medical use, and it gives law enforcement a justification for corruption and brutality.Law student, University of MumbaiThe theme is to desperately convince us that Sanders can\u0027t win. They repeat it over and over, even though Sanders polls as well or better than Hillary Clinton does against every leading Republican candidate.Executive director, National Nurses United (AFL-CIO) and California Nurses AssociationThe solutions aren\u0027t difficult. We just need the motivation, regulation and coordination. The alternative, in today\u0027s Wild Wild West of Internet of Things development, is a runaway increase in security nightmares. It is better to set the standards now and ensure a safer cyber world for our children and ourselves.Academic, Researcher, Writer, EntrepreneurThe French turned out, en masse, to say that they did not want to see the Le Pen gang take possession of their regions. That is the most important lesson from Sunday\u0027s vote, and it is a reassuring one. But what caused the nation to right itself?Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.Only a few street blocks from where foreign ministers from the US, Europe and various Middle Eastern countries met in Paris on Monday to discuss the Syrian refugee crisis, the former Syrian \"mother of the homeland\" of ancient Europe sat on display at the Louvre Museum.Author of \"Damnatio Memoriae: A Play, Una Commedia,\" www.jeffbiggers.comThe anxious class feels vulnerable to forces over which they have no control. Terrible things happen for no reason. Yet government can\u0027t be counted on to protect them.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027Sexton\u0027s goal for this diverse campus has been to bridge the racial, ethnic and cultural divisions that are re-emerging at American colleges and universities by instilling the ecumenical vision of an iconoclastic dreamer from Brooklyn\u0027s Bedford-Stuyvesant who defied boundaries.Urban affairs correspondent for The New York Times; Author of \u0027A History of New York in 101 Objects\u0027Public health research on gun violence by the CDC and NIH can save Americans from firearm injury and deaths. Congress must support scientists who are willing to ask tough questions, do credible analyses, and share truthful conclusions.Host of \"Dr. America\" on We Act Radio, pediatrician in Washington DC, member of the National Physicians AllianceGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
