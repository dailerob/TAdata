President, Writers Guild of America, East.David Brooks, one of the most prominent of Republican elites in the country, who has even been touted as President Obama\u0027s \"favorite pundit,\" is calling on the donor class to rescue the party from the rabble. Game\u0027s over, voters: The oligarchs will decide this election. For that\u0027s what they are: a small, unbelievably wealthy group of the powerful and privileged who already have a tighter grip on our nation, its government, politics and economy than the rapacious robber barons of our first Gilded Age. Brooks and like-minded elites believe they must be trusted to do the right thing. Let them be the Deciderers.Paul Krugman insists, \"The question Sanders supporters should ask is, When has their theory of change ever worked?\" That must be right. It\u0027s an excellent, sober, adult question. The answer, of course, depends what you think the Sanders campaign\u0027s theory of change is.Professor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027Honoring Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. should sharply remind us that the Civil Rights Movement should never just be chapters in history books. Communities and children across the country need to believe they can stay on the march towards justice.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe only way you can justify a position in which a woman does not make her own reproductive decisions is if you believe she is not ethically and morally capable, as a function of her gender, and, in the U.S., race. It means you do not trust her to be a fully adult, fully human, being.Feminist, writer, and satirist (not always in that order)Despite its significance, we are just days away from the \"first in the nation\" Iowa caucuses and the direction of this election is still very much \"up in the air\" and about as confusing as any in recent memory. Iowa, therefore, will be important.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Cecil may be roaring from heaven that other lions throughout Africa, including members of his former pride, may not experience his horrible fate, thanks to a federal rule that goes into effect today.President and CEO, The Humane Society of the United StatesI believe that genius is made of three important ingredients: creative impulse, hard work and careful study. They are created, not born. Bowie was a genius. One more for old times sake, Mister Jones, with glitter on top?Co-founder and songwriter of The RunawaysFor more than a year, an entire city was exposed to the risk of lead poisoning. Those children will suffer neurological damage for the rest of their lives. Long after you and I are gone, some of them will still be living a life diminished. No matter what happens now, that cannot be undone.Executive Director, The Sierra ClubI refuse to hinder his fondness for certain colors, prevent him from innocently wearing certain clothing or narrowing his creativity because society doesn\u0027t deem it proper or fitting for his gender.Blogger, teacher, soldier, and motherTed Cruz\u0027s position on net neutrality is so full of whoppers that it has to be taken apart, sentence by sentence, to fully demonstrate the depth of his dishonesty.Senior Director of Strategy, Free Press and Free Press Action FundIf voters want a reformation of government, they must look for more fundamental change than electing a \"strong\" leader.Founder, Leadership for a Responsible SocietyWe\u0027ve heard a lot about democratic socialism lately, as the self-described socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders poses an ever-bigger threat to Hillary Clinton. But what is democratic socialism?Executive Vice President, Cato Institute; Author, \u0027The Libertarian Mind\u0027 (2015)The frontier to conquer this time is not space but the depths of our own genomes. There\u0027s hope that the ability to correct faulty genes and the mutations they cause will lead to new cures for cancer.Author, Biocode: The New Age of GenomicsBourbon whiskey continues to trend upward, as more and more drinkers eschew clear and imported spirits for a taste of the iconic brown liquor.Father of twins, journalist, writer, lover of bourbon, wine and great beerNew York Times pundit Tom Friedman apparently doesn\u0027t understand that the idea that \"died in 1989\" was Communism. Senator Bernie Sanders, the \"socialist\" he\u0027s referring to, isn\u0027t a Communist.E.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeThe financial crisis is behind us, right? Why would Wall Street shower Hillary Clinton with millions of dollars in speaking fees and tens of millions in campaign contributions? I think it is an insurance policy.Bestselling author of Survival Investing: How to Prosper Amid Thieving Banks and Corrupt Governments and professor of finance at S P Jain School of Global ManagementAre Republicans completely, and recklessly, abandoning their modern commitment (it wasn\u0027t always so) to the free trade ideas of their purported hero, Ronald Reagan?Founder and President, Roumell Asset Management, LLCIf \"affluenza\" is indeed what caused Ethan Couch to get behind the wheel with a blood alcohol count three times the legal limit for adults, resulting in the deaths of four people, he deserves to face consequences. But he also deserves to get some help.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarThis week, NOAA and NASA announced that 2015 was the hottest year on record globally, by a wide margin. That\u0027s the bad news. But here\u0027s the good news: We as a global community are starting to get serious about doing something about it.Mayor of Portland, OregonMayor of StockholmMayor of VancouverDuring a brief interregnum between exalted expectations and dreary realism, let’s celebrate once again that rarest of things: good news in a perilous world.Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogU.S. officials believe it to be too risky but sending aid airdrops is necessary to help Syrians, especially in the besieged Eastern city of Deir Ezzor where thousands of Syrians are starving.Syrian American working to empower local governance structures in SyriaSix years ago this week, the U.S. Supreme Court created a Wild West of campaign finance regulations. With their decision in Citizens United, five justices set the stage for a flood of secret special interest money trying to buy elections nationwide.Ensuring corporate accountability in practice is more difficult, but fortunately the U.S. already has a blueprint from which to build a human rights reporting and monitoring framework for eventual investment in Iran.Director, The International Corporate Accountability RoundtableOne of the worst examples of under-covered hate is the escalation of attacks and the persecution of Christians, particularly outside of the United States, where thousands are routinely murdered and imprisoned, while their magnificent sacred churches are destroyed.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityI was shocked and dismayed at a meeting yesterday of the Environment and Public Works Committee (EPW) to consider S. 659, the so-called \"Bipartisan Sportsmen Act,\" which included an unrelated amendment that weakens our nation\u0027s drinking water protections.Ranking Member, Senate Environment and Public Works CommitteeI would bite back all the words I wanted to say.

I\u0027m glad that she\u0027s passionate about the lack of care our vets get when they come home. I\u0027m glad that she used her spotlight to go off script and use her annoyingly shrill voice to raise awareness of a serious issue that\u0027s been plaguing this country for over a century.Richard Zombeck is a freelance writer for hire and a podcaster at T\u0026ZTalk.com.Just 53 men and 9 women have as much wealth as more than 3.6 billion people on this planet. Such a startling statistic highlights how extreme inequality has picked up a dramatic pace.President, Oxfam AmericaFlint is a view into our tomorrows and we cannot fail to fix it and get it right. The population is animated and angry and there has to be collaboration between government entities or we will see the acceleration of a larger national deterioration.Best selling author, TV political analyst, communications and public relations expertIf the predictions are correct -- if Planet 9 actually exists -- then our solar system will better comport with many of those we find elsewhere. And if our solar system is not so special, then there\u0027s added reason to suspect that the biology it has spawned may not be so unusual either.Senior Astronomer, SETI InstituteI have no kids. Looking back on it, I see that my childlessness resulted from a combination of circumstances and nature -- but also some unfortunate decisions on my part. Or rather, the lack of decision.
