{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundIn September 2013, a statue of Nelson Mandela was unveiled in front of the South African Embassy on Massachusetts Avenue in Washington. Close by on the same Avenue is a beautiful statue of Mahatma Gandhi. Amidst all the monuments to wars and military leaders in our nation’s capital, we now have lasting testaments to three great prophets of nonviolence and peace to guide our actions at this inflection point in our nation’s and world’s history. The lives of Martin Luther King, Mahatma Gandhi, and Nelson Mandela show us what is possible. Let’s not just celebrate and mourn them. Let’s follow them.CommentsTEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"To kick off the New Year, TEDWeekends is proud to present a compilation of six insanely popular TED Talks from our 2013 programming. These talks inspired a tremendous amount of engagement from our community last year, and each one provides valuable insight that will help you get the most out of life in 2014.Comments (12)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarWhat happens when a generation said to be far less conspicuous in its consumption confronts human nature? The personal growth and fulfillment at the top Maslow\u0027s Hierarchy of Needs occupies the floor just above esteem -- defined by status, achievement and reputation.Comments (13)Bob CescaManaging Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowThis is absolutely indicative of what\u0027s become of online journalism. The mad scramble for both content and clicks has overtaken integrity, reality and the truth.Comments (53)Linda McMahonCo-founder and former CEO, WWE; 2012 Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in ConnecticutDemocrats and Republicans didn\u0027t find a lot to agree on in 2013, but the first and most important action they should agree on in 2014 is to delay -- perhaps indefinitely -- the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act.Comments (54)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027This past year taught me so much about the gospel and caused me to go deeper into my faith. As this new year begins, here are five spiritual resolutions I learned from last year.CommentsGeoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoThe central question posed by the bulk telephony meta-data program is this: Is the government\u0027s collection of an individual\u0027s telephone call records from the individual\u0027s telephone service provider a \"search\" of that individual within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment?Comments (30)Miho KubagawaBirmingham, AL native working in the education sector in NYCFor the first time in my life, I actually stuck to my New Year\u0027s resolution for 2013. My friends did too and we\u0027re already discussing what we\u0027re going to focus on for 2014. What sparked the change?CommentsRichard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureWhy are we arguing about hypothetical futures and ignoring the very real present?Comments (175)James ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027There was another dimension of ABSCAM which \"American Hustle\" doesn\u0027t consider and media reviews have ignored and that is the impact ABSCAM had on Arab Americans.CommentsMartha BurkMoney Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsThe truth is that as a country, we\u0027re getting stingier, not more generous with the poor. And the difference between the very rich and the rest of us has grown astronomically since President Johnson declared his war.Comments (47)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorYou can imagine my surprise when I received a request from a certain notorious former President of the United States asking for my financial support in his public policy center\u0027s efforts to address the \"challenges facing our world.\"Comments (226)Shelley EmlingSenior Editor, HuffPost 50It\u0027s unbelievable to me how something that was a rare perk only a few years back is now considered as indispensable as a napkin or toilet when traveling in any part of the world.Comments (19)Joe PeyronninHofstra Journalism ProfessorMuch of the country kicked off the New Year with heavy snowstorms followed by a blast of frigid cold temperatures. But for 1.3 million Americans, whose unemployment checks have been cut off, this may be the coldest winter of all.Comments (24)Ben IrwinAuthor, bloggerWhile it\u0027s popular to think people are poor because they\u0027re lazy, the poor actually work longer and harder than the rest of us.Comments (119)William NicholsonScreenwriter, AuthorA global icon, a legend, an inspiration. How do you make a movie about such a man? The first answer, looking back, is: slowly. We didn\u0027t know at the beginning that it would take the rest of Mandela\u0027s life, and that within days of the release of the finished film he would be dead.CommentsJosh FleetFormer Associate Editor, HuffPost ReligionBefore I learned about listening in a Jewish prayer context, I learned about it in the shul of Phish. As a young fan, and amateur guitar player, theirs was an infinite well of ear-training, heart-opening music.Comments (16)Noble SmithAuthorJ.R.R. Tolkien and G.R.R. Martin have millions of devoted followers who swear that one of them is better than the other. I\u0027m a fan of both of these great storytellers, but I believe that Middle-earth will be held up as an exemplar of fantasy (and literature) long after Westeros has faded away.Comments (200)Amitai EtzioniProfessor of international relations, George Washington UniversityWill people feel better if they are promised an end to inequality but get only a haircut for the rich and a limited lift for the poor? I wonder. A fair society might be more within reach.CommentsJenny TroutWriter, bloggerThe reason Jennifer Lawrence is allowed to be a body-positive role model to young girls and \"chubby\" women is because she is representative of conventional beauty. Jennifer Lawrence\u0027s public image has been built on a foundation of fat girl drag.Comments (113)David FreudbergHost of the public radio series “Humankind”In the din of polemics and punditry about health care reform, we have not heard much from one vitally important voice: that of young people now attending medical school, to whom we will entrust the future of health care.Comments (28)Terry O\u0027NeillPresident, National Organization for WomenI don\u0027t doubt that the individuals who control the Little Sisters of the Poor are entitled to religious freedom. I wish they could recognize that their First Amendment right to practice their own religion doesn\u0027t trump women\u0027s basic rights.Comments (103)Robert NaimanPolicy Director, Just Foreign PolicyNow we know that it\u0027s actually not so hard to get Washington to do the right thing if the choices are framed correctly. Having learned this lesson, let us apply it to the question of future wars, and to the proposed Iran war in particular.Comments (50)Rev. Richard CizikPresident, The New Evangelical Partnership for the Common GoodWith my legs spread out in front of me, exhausted and in total fear, I pray repeatedly \"Lord, don\u0027t let my son die.\" EMT officials administer RCAN, but the heart monitor set up a few feet away is flat-lined. He died in my arms.CommentsCarl PopeFormer executive director and chairman, Sierra ClubClimate disruption, broadband access and crumbling bridges and roads have an odd thing in common: they have entered the never-never land of conservative denialism -- where they are simply not problems for which the right feels obliged to offer solutions.Comments (74)Lincoln Mitchelllincolnmitchell.com2013 was the year where issues of income inequality, raised by the Occupy Movement in 2011, stressed by Pope Francis and, belatedly, by President Obama finally came to the fore of American politics. It is likely they will remain there for some time to come.Comments (120)Dr. Chris MartineDavid Burpee Professor at Bucknell UniversityA brand new cell part that flavors wine, a flower that depends on \"footlong\" moth tongues and a list of about 1,000 new species are the stories that topped my list of the most impressive things we learned about plants last year.CommentsPaul SzepTwo-time Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonistCommentsPeter DreierE.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeProgressives are rarely satisfied. It is part of our political DNA. There\u0027s so much injustice in the world, it\u0027s sometimes hard to feel that we\u0027re making progress. Let\u0027s look back at 2013 and examine 25 significant accomplishments.Comments (23)Jessica ChassinFreshman at Elon UniversityIf my own 50-year-old Dad had a problem with a harmless selfie of us taken at a Jets game, how would an older or sick person feel if you Instagrammed a picture of them while they are at their lowest most vulnerable place?Comments (13)Christine PelosiChair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusAs 2014 dawns, women on the run in political office and public service have multitasking ahead. How well we juggle doing it all -- home life, work life, personal space and public engagement -- may well determine the fate of our families and our nation.CommentsNorm Stamper, 2014. 4.01Chris McGowan, 2014. 4.01Brian DAmbrosio, 2014. 4.01Jackie K.
