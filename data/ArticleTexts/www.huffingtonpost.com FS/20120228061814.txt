{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Foreign Policy Analyst, Cato InstituteHow many more American soldiers and innocent Afghan civilians have to die before the Obama administration withdraws from Afghanistan? The burning of Quran at a U.S. base outside of Kabul and the riots that followed might jeopardize the U.S. training mission in Afghanistan. On top of limited and potentially unsustainable security improvements, the spiraling violence does not instill confidence in our ability to achieve a \"victory.\" It is time for the United States to downsize its mission in Afghanistan. Despite good intentions, we have overstayed our welcome.Read Post | Comments (144)Robert Reich, 02/27/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Aftershock\u0027A party of birthers, creationists, theocrats, climate-change deniers, nativists, gay-bashers and anti-abortionists cannot govern America.

Daughters, Fathers, And The Changing American Family\u0027In 30 years, women are settled in everywhere from the CEO\u0027s office to the Supreme Court to the battlefield to earth orbit.

But it is not at the bottom of a pill bottle. It is at the end of our forks.
