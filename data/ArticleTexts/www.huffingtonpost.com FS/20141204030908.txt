Based on what we\u0027ve seen in just one month, my bet is on a lot more to come.Nelson and David Rockefeller Senior Fellow for Latin America Studies and Director for Latin America Studies, Council on Foreign RelationsThe absence of a unifying core may help explain the Democrats\u0027 devastating 2014 performance. But the problem wasn\u0027t that the party lacked a common message. The problem was that its leaders seemed to lack commonly-held values. Many of its candidates even seemed to be lacking in core convictions.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourMovies have power. Power to impact society and the choices we make. I want to entertain, but I also want to say something to the world. I want us to look up on screen and be inspired to want more for ourselves, to want to love, and to love ourselves.Award-winning writer and directorThe poison pill for private sector unions is likely be a model bill from the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) with the Orwellian name of \"right to work.\"The Center for Media and Democracy/ALEC ExposedAnniversaries are an opportunity to look back on the journey and see what progress has been achieved, what lessons have been applied and where history seems poised, even determined, to repeat itself. And so, what have we learned since the Bhopal disaster in 1984?Health Care Without Harm president and co-founderIf local police are going to receive military weapons at all, the federal government has an obligation to put some reasonable constraints on how they are able to use them.Senior counsel, Center for Justice, ACLUCops have really hard jobs. That doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s off limits ever to question the manner in which some of them fulfill their responsibilities or to raise serious concerns about the institutional racism that undeniably pervades our culture and inevitably affects how policing is carried out.Director of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel HillMaybe death, pleasure, security, and risk are the products of this region.

There were five things I hated about being overweight.Author, Coach, Marathoner, Blogger at KimanziConstable.comOne year ago, a sexual assault survivor in the U.S. military faced a daunting landscape. The president gave military leaders one year to implement the defense bill and show significant progress.
