{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOWatching the debate at a Fortune women\u0027s conference, I asked Meg Whitman, the co-chair of McCain\u0027s campaign, what she thought of Palin\u0027s performance. \"Good enough,\" she said. But good enough for what, exactly? After Thursday night, the only thing Palin proved herself good enough for is starring in her own reality show. Watching Biden and Palin on the same stage was like watching a tennis champion walk onto Centre Court at Wimbledon only to find himself facing an over-eager toddler holding a tennis racket on the other side of the net. The only subject on which Palin displayed superior knowledge was when she corrected Biden on the proper delivery of \"Drill, baby, drill!\" Christie Hefner thought Palin\u0027s sex-tinged twist on the chant should be appropriated for a commercial. Perhaps for Viagra. My patience with Sarah Palin is waving the white flag of surrender.Read Post | CommentsBIONora Ephron, 10.03.2008CNN had a graph running along the bottom of the screen during the debate, allegedly representing the moment-by-moment feelings of a group of independent voters. This is no way to watch a debate.Read Post | Comments (19)BIORobert Shrum, 10.02.2008Sarah Palin has experience being a runner-up -- which will come in handy in November. Tonight she barely kept up. By any rational assessment, Palin wasn\u0027t up to the job.Read Post | Comments (249)Madeleine Albright, 10.02.2008Tonight, Joe Biden showed why he is the right person for that job. On question after question, he demonstrated knowledge, careful thought, and a willingness to make hard decisions.Read Post | Comments (134)BIOPaul Reiser, 10.02.2008The moment when Biden talked about the death of his wife and child, and raising his sons himself was tremendously moving and genuine. It was a bold -- and very relevant -- point to make.Read Post | Comments (72)BIOAdam McKay, 10.02.2008Not only do I want to grab a beer with Biden but I might even have three or four and maybe some onion rings. He was masterful tonight.Read Post | Comments (55)Sheryl Crow, 10.03.2008I, for one, am terrified that all the \"soccer moms\" and the \"Joe six-packs\" will fall for the likable candidate as being qualified to lead our country. I don\u0027t want someone who is likable.Read Post | CommentsBIOBrandon Friedman, 10.03.2008In most cases, this type of oversight on the part of a politician could be dismissed -- maybe even attributed to nerves. But when Afghanistan is exploding and on the verge of failure, details matter.Read Post | CommentsBIOA.J. Bockelman, 10.03.2008It was very interesting to watch Palin when the camera was on Biden. On foreign policy and other points where she gave light answers, she was intently reviewing her notes on the podium.Read Post | CommentsBIOLeah McElrath Renna, 10.02.2008Joe Biden did more for the equality of the sexes with his honest display of paternal emotion during the vice presidential debate than Sarah Palin\u0027s presence on the executive ticket has or will ever do.Read Post | Comments (231)BIOMichael Shaw, 10.03.2008Sleeper highlight of the evening? Surprisingly, it was how the Biden family neutralized the PR power of the Palin family in the post-debate milling around.Read Post | CommentsBIOJacob Heilbrunn, 10.02.2008Her performance wasn\u0027t the disaster that some in the GOP have been fearing. But cliché was piled upon cliché as Palin sought to paint Obama as a goofy radical who would end up running America off the rails.Read Post | Comments (224)BIOArt Brodsky, 10.02.2008In Sarahland, answering questions asked to you is optional. You say what you want to say, regardless of what that old-school questioner has to offer.Read Post | Comments (15)RJ Eskow, 10.03.2008Michael Showalter, 10.02.2008Ari Melber, 10.02.2008Rachel Sklar, 10.02.2008236.com, 10.02.2008Adele Stan, 10.02.2008Andy Borowitz, 10.02.2008Keith Thomson, 10.02.2008Alexis C.
