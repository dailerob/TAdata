{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressAs much as I\u0027d like to help everyone pretend that tonight\u0027s Super Tuesday results are going to be partly cloudy with a chance of some interesting twists, I think what I\u0027m going to do instead is lay down a great big spoiler. So, you\u0027ve been warned! At the end of the night, Mitt Romney\u0027s campaign will be able to plainly state that it has won a plurality of the delegates at stake, that it\u0027s nearer than any of its competitors to the magic number of 1,144 delegates and that it has widened its lead over the rest of the competition.

Keegan, 03/06/12President, People For the American WayHow hard is it to say that women who advocate for insurance coverage for contraceptives should be heard and shouldn\u0027t be called prostitutes for stating their position on the topic? Is it really worth compromising basic decency to stay in the good graces of Rush Limbaugh?Read Post | Comments (52)Bob Cesca, 03/06/12Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez Show, Media ProducerYesterday, I contacted Rush (the band) about Rush Limbaugh\u0027s airing of their music on his show, and today I was exclusively informed that the legendary Canadian rock group has officially demanded that the Rush Limbaugh Program stop using its music on the air.Read Post | Comments (211)Lara Bergthold, 03/06/12Executive Director, Lear Family Foundation; Board Chair, People for the American Way and the Campaign for America’s FutureIf politicians like Rick Santorum want to promote stable families, they should start by respecting all families.
