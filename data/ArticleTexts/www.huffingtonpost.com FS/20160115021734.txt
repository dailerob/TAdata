{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor of international relations, George Washington UniversityLarge segments of the public, on the right and on the left, the Trumplings and the Sandernistas, are angry not because the government did not properly stuff their Christmas stocking. They have many good, and quite a few far from good, reasons to be very angry. They are the people who lost their homes, a good part of their life savings, and jobs during the recent Great Recession. Those who got new jobs are paid much less and receive fewer benefits.

Offering them a few goodies will not do. What must be done is to redirect their anger to the proper address.Four years ago, Donald Trump, a Penn graduate, who routinely tells crowds how smart he is, rightly demanded that President Obama release his transcripts.

The reason is simple: the Arab and Turkmen Islamist groups are the main bulwark against the expansion of the de facto autonomous Kurdish enclave in northern Syria. Thus, Erdogan tries hard after each ISIS attack to create a \"generic\" threat of terrorism in which all groups are bundled up together without any clear references to ISIS. He is trying to present the PKK as enemy number one.Senior fellow, Brookings Institution; Professor of National Security Strategy, U.S. National War CollegeTo be clear: God is not finished with the Episcopal Church yet.

I\u0027m subconsciously biased in a hundred and one ways. I\u0027m lacking in conscientiousness.

These same threats also enhance our awareness that all of us are members of a single species.
