{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week brought several reminders of the virtues of skepticism. On Thursday, the Obama administration announced it would \"dramatically\" increase U.S. aid to the Syrian rebels, citing an upgrade from \"varying degrees of confidence\" in April to \"high confidence\" this week that the Syrian government had used chemical weapons. So the U.S. inches down the road of mission creep in a civil war featuring one side backed by Hezbollah and the other by \"al-Qaeda-linked extremists.\" With the White House citing \"high confidence\" about WMD, what could possibly go wrong? Skepticism also greeted NSA head General Keith Alexander, who claimed that the agency\u0027s electronic surveillance had helped stop dozens of terror attacks, and that revelations about the program have done \"great harm\" to our security. Meanwhile, President Obama said he \"welcomed\" a public debate on the issue (Really? So why\u0027d he keep the program hidden for years?). Once again, Einstein had it right: \"Blind belief in authority is the greatest enemy of truth.\"Comments (110)John CusackMakes films; Board member, Freedom of the Press FoundationThe Snowden Principle, and that fire that inspired him to take unimaginable risks, is fundamentally about fostering an informed and engaged public. The Constitution embraces that idea.Comments (2,198)Valerie JarrettSenior Advisor and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsTo compete on an even playing field, we need to create our own field with teammates that respect and support what it takes for us to be healthy and whole.Comments (83)Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoIn my judgment, based on what I know from the media thus far, Snowden is neither a hero nor a traitor, but he is most certainly a criminal who deserves serious punishment.Comments (2,566)Arianna HuffingtonThe themes and ideas that make up what we call The Third Metric -- redefining success beyond money and power to include things like well-being, wisdom, wonder, and giving back -- are resonating at every social and economic level, as more and more people are realizing the need for a more humane and sustainable way of doing business.Comments (100)Theo JansenArtistIn my talk, I mentioned that the Strandbeest would develop a digital brain.

In December of last year, I was diagnosed with prostate cancer.Comments (105)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarThe first step towards getting a boss to loosen her grip is to remove any possibility from her mind that she needs to be that way. Get to work on time. Meet deadlines. Be productive. Make clients happy.Comments (38)François HollandePresident of FranceIt is a test for the G8, a group of advanced economies that must lead by example. The challenge is to work together to do everything in our power to build a safer, more prosperous, more sustainable, and fairer future.Comments (76)AmeliaMother, wife, partner and breadwinnerWhat could I say to this young man who meant so much to my kid, this young man who, by playing a television character, had helped lead my son to tell me about his orientation and, by extension, helped change the trajectory of my own life toward activism?Comments (239)Ricky GervaisActor, writer, comedian, director, producerNever grow up. If you\u0027re writing or directing, give yourself enough time to play. Play the fool. Goad. Shock. Laugh. Trip over something that isn\u0027t there. Try something. And never be afraid to fail. That failure is useful too. It\u0027s just another building block.Comments (133)Martha BurkMoney Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsThe annual June Father\u0027s day shopping binge is at its zenith. Stores are touting the latest gizmos and geegaws, and everybody loves Dad. All except corporate America, that is.

He likes it a lot. Not as much as I do because my like borders on obsession and fixation. But he likes it. What my husband hates, is me, after I watch Mad Men.Comments (129)Patton OswaltComedian and writer who lives and drinks in Los AngelesThere is a collective consciousness that can detect the presence (and approach) of something good or bad, in society or the world, before any hard \"evidence\" exists. It\u0027s happening now with the concept of \"rape culture.\" Which, by the way, isn\u0027t a concept. It\u0027s a reality.Comments (92)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistThere was barely one moment in my life that I can remember when my father was unrecognizable. Whenever we were out together as a family, people would approach him and ask for his autograph or to shake his hand. We accepted it as the way it was, and we were proud that so many people liked our dad.Comments (22)Michael BoltonSongwriter, recording artist and Chairman, The Michael Bolton Charities, Inc.This Father\u0027s Day can be remembered as the day when we fathers turned a collective corner, reducing domestic violence and sexual abuse to an aberration, not an everyday occurrence.Comments (161)Lindsey OrlofskyWriter, marketerAs a Jewish woman from New York, I could not be more appalled with the Bravo network\u0027s decision to air this train wreck of a show, and the cast members\u0027 decisions to fuel this stereotypical fire.Comments (160)David BromwichProfessor of Literature, Yale UniversityThe architects of behavior will thus be warranted in telling the people that they can win back the confidence of the government only by redoubled efforts. Would it not be easier in that case for the government to dissolve the people and elect another?Comments (92)Pedro AlmodóvarFilm director and producerI\u0027m sitting at the keyboard in my briefs and t-shirt. I can see Fifth Avenue through my windows. I take advantage of this seclusion to interview myself.Comments (12)Jackie BezosPresident and co-founder, Bezos Family FoundationOn a humid Saturday, June 8th, one million bones created by students, educators, artists and activists were laid on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. as a visual petition to end genocide and mass atrocities.Comments (15)Amb.
