{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Kirk DouglasActorUnder the flooring of my dressing room is a safe. In it are two guns that I used to shoot the bad guys in movies and a silver plated revolver with my name engraved on it which was given to me by some crazy fan. People take their movie heroes very seriously. I often played the good cowboy on screen, riding in to save the day. Now, everybody thinks he is a cowboy too. That frightens me. We have become a cowboy country with too many guns. I am 96-years-old. I have many grandchildren. I would hate to leave them a world where guns are easily accessible. Children don\u0027t vote, adults do. It\u0027s time to do something to make our children safer. America\u0027s cowboy days are over.Comments (378)Joe CirincionePresident, Ploughshares Fund; Author, \u0027Bomb Scare: The History and Future of Nuclear Weapons\u0027Susan Rice does not speak very often on nuclear policy, but behind the scenes she played a major role in shaping Barack Obama\u0027s nuclear weapons positions in the 2008 campaign.Comments (17)Andrew LosowskySenior Books Editor, The Huffington PostSome people just can\u0027t help but be judgemental. They roll their eyes when they see your shoes, your haircut... but worst of all can be when they see what you\u0027re reading.Comments (525)Marjorie CohnProfessor, Thomas Jefferson School of LawBradley Manning fulfilled his legal duty to report war crimes. He complied with his legal duty to obey lawful orders but also his legal duty to disobey unlawful orders.Comments (349)Kia MakarechiEntertainment Editor, The Huffington PostIf you\u0027re cool with Madonna and Jay-Z (or U-God from Wu-Tang Clan, Lord Finesse, etc. etc. etc.) playing holier-than-you but have Kanye issues serious enough to compel you to take to the Internet and voice your concerns, it\u0027s time for a long, hard look in the mirror.Comments (150)Alan DershowitzCriminal and civil liberties lawyerSamantha Power will be respected for her intelligence, scholarship and independence. I am confident that she will represent us effectively, persuasively and morally at a time and place that requires her particular talents.CommentsJanet TavakoliPresident, Tavakoli Structured FinanceThe IMF threw Greece under the bus. In particular, it ludicrously downplayed the damage its recommended austerity measures would do to the Greek economy, which is in the grips of a prolonged and deep recession.Comments (14)Noam ChomskyInstitute Professor emeritus, MIT Department of Linguistics and PhilosophyImagine you\u0027re an historian 100 years from now -- assuming there are any historians 100 years from now, which is not obvious -- and you\u0027re looking back at what\u0027s happening today. You\u0027d see something quite remarkable.Comments (728)Shelley EmlingEditor, Post 50No matter what income level they\u0027ve achieved, some people still don\u0027t have a clue as to how to draw others to them. They don\u0027t know what to say to put others at ease or how to act in order to electrify a room. But by the time you reach 50, you should know a thing or two about how to impress those around you.Comments (115)Bruce LubinAuthor, Who Knew?Don\u0027t spend money on bug sprays. Their main ingredient is usually alcohol, so save some money by simply making a mixture of one part rubbing alcohol and four parts water, then spraying it on as you would bug spray.Comments (152)StingComposer, Singer, Actor, ActivistFor nearly three years, I\u0027ve been working on a new musical play called The Last Ship. The inspiration for it really stemmed from my album The Soul Cages that I wrote in 1990, which depicted the landscape of my hometown, Wallsend, in the Northeast of England.Comments (14)Roger WatersMusician, singer, songwriter and founding member of Pink FloydYour great country stands at the gateway between east and west. Istanbul is legend in the history of civilization. Your resistance today may well be a turning point between all of us and a return to the dark ages.Comments (72)Christine HasslerLife coach, professional speaker, author and Gen Y expertSix months before my wedding, he called it off. So there I was at 28: heartbroken, in debt, physically sick, at odds with my family and lacking direction in my career.Comments (86)William BradleyPolitical Analyst, NewWestNotes.comAs national security advisor, she doesn\u0027t have to be a natural diplomat with a gift of politesse. She has to be smart, analytical, articulate, and hard-working. And she has to have the confidence of the president. Which she clearly does.CommentsEmily VanCampActressToday, on this World Environment Day, a day that celebrates all the courageous and positive environmental actions taking place around the world, I stop to reflect on what being an environmentalist means to me.CommentsJulian AssangeEditor-in-Chief and Founder, WikiLeaksIn the end it is not Bradley Manning who is on trial. His trial ended long ago. The defendant now, and for the next 12 weeks, is the United States. A runaway military, whose misdeeds have been laid bare, and a secretive government at war with the public. They sit in the docks. We are called to serve as jurists. We must not turn away.Comments (896)Rainer SiglFreelance journalist, video games bloggerI want a game that respects my limited free time, that teaches me its basics in minutes, not hours of tutorials; a game, in short, that respects its players as adults, both in regard to content, quality and the time investment needed to enjoy it.CommentsEllen MalcolmFounder and chair of the board, EMILY\u0027s ListAdding women to our legislative democracy can make Congress work better. We would never see the partisan game-playing that horrifies us if half the members of Congress were women. And certainly those who abuse women... or allow it to continue... would be held accountable.Comments (90)Kergan Edwards-StoutAuthor, \u0027Songs for the New Depression\u0027I reached out to both those who directly faced the onslaught of HIV/AIDS and those who are younger who have never known a world without it, to find out how 32 years of HIV/AIDS have affected their lives. Here are 32 voices on the 32nd year of AIDS.Comments (69)Mary IannoneGraduate student, Media, Culture, and CommunicationEvery event was analyzed for impending trigger sounds. My social life was practically nonexistent, as even going to the movies became one of the most improbably stressful situations.CommentsToni PanettaFeminist, political \u0026 policy strategist, connector, opiner, social-change organizerPower\u0027s appointment should be considered a signal that Obama wants his foreign policy legacy to include more than just a footnoted commentary about his desire to advance human rights on a global scale.CommentsMartha Beck, PhDBest-selling author and columnist for O, The Oprah MagazineWe liberated women thought we could have it all back in the overachieving \u002780s and \u002790s. It turned out that we could have everything but sleep.CommentsDavid ShusterHost and Managing Editor, \u0027Take Action News with David Shuster\u0027While Congresswoman Michele Bachmann was announcing her retirement to much fanfare in the media, according to information given exclusively to Take Action News, the FBI was busy collecting potentially damaging evidence against her from two former campaign aides.Comments (83)Kara Wahlgrenfreelance writer and photographer, www.kiwiphotostudio.comIf you\u0027re planning a wedding, you\u0027ve probably heard this spiel one or twenty times already: After the cake is cut, the flowers are wilted, and the last favor has been stuffed into your Aunt Betty\u0027s purse, only your photos remain.Comments (17)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistTyra Banks got called \"Lightbulb Head.\" Chris Colfer was stuffed into lockers. Rihanna was mocked for not being \"black enough.\" And as for Howard Stern, he had to go to judo school just to learn to defend himself. And all of them not only survived, but thrived.Comments (210)Pauline MuchinaSenior Partnership Advisor, UNAIDSWhen I was a little girl, I asked my Dad why he did not beat my Mom, or discriminate against his daughters in education like the other men in our community. He said that it was because of Jesus.Comments (42)Simon RosenbergPresident, NDNBy any measure the U.S. government\u0027s policy towards the border in recent years has been successful, and with the passage of the well-crafted and thoughtful Senate bill, the border can become safer still.Comments (13)Mike RyanSenior Entertainment Writer, The Huffington PostI often wonder how Josh Baskin feels now, 25 years after the release of the movie \"Big,\" which told his (fictional) story. I wonder if he ever says to himself, right before falling asleep, You know, I\u0027d probably be running MacMillan Toys by now if I had just stayed an adult.Comments (21)Jonathan AskinProfessor, Brooklyn Law SchoolI am not married. I am not gay. I have no desire for society to sanction my relationships. I, however, do feel like a step-citizen, because I do not share in the social and economic benefits that society grants to those who obtain State-issued marriage licenses.Comments (36)Kathleen PeddicordPublisher, Live and Invest OverseasHow many American retirees live overseas? Why is it nearly impossible to come up with real numbers? One reason has to do with deciding who is an American.Comments (11)Greta Van SusterenHost of Fox News\u0027 \u0027On the Record with Greta Van Susteren\u0027A new report today is about one IRS conference in Anaheim in 2010 that cost 4.1 million dollars. 4.1 million of YOUR dollars to party! How could they possibly think it was okay to take YOUR money to party? And don\u0027t tell me it was a conference -- that is absurd!Comments (257)Chris Weigant, 2013. 5.06Rick Steves, 2013. 5.06Christian Piatt, 2013. 5.06Write for the Future, 2013. 5.06Bart van Poll, 2013. 5.06Shira Lazar, 2013. 5.06Bruce E.
