{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesIt\u0027s an understatement to say there\u0027s some apprehension among many gays and lesbians about the Supreme Court\u0027s decision to take up the Prop 8 case. Is the fear warranted? That\u0027s a tricky question and depends on what it is you\u0027re afraid of. Is it quite possible that the court will hand down a sweeping decision upholding marriage bans in over 30 other states, ruling that marriage is not a fundamental right for gays? Absolutely, and if that\u0027s what you\u0027re afraid of, then be very afraid. Such a ruling could have a broad and enduring impact. But I\u0027m not afraid of the Supreme Court, and I am completely prepared for the worst possible outcome while hoping for the best. The court can\u0027t hold us back, nor can it stop a movement, even if it becomes an ugly impediment.Read Post | Comments (334)Amitai Etzioni, 12/10/12GWU ProfessorIt is morally abhorrent to cut benefits to any current or future seniors before much greater efforts are made to stop large scale raids on the Medicare coffers by nefarious corporations.Read Post | Comments (77)Kate Silver, 12.10.2012Kate SilverLike Jason\u0027s quest to find the Golden Fleece with the help of the Argonauts, GM enlisted the Argonne (National Laboratory) to help them produce the revolutionary battery for Chevrolet\u0027s Volt.Read Post | Comments (25)Jasmine Stein, 12/10/12AuthorFor women it\u0027s sometimes feels like once we get to a certain age, we are destined to hand over control of our bodies to another being, along with whatever hopes and dreams we had for ourselves.Read Post | Comments (22)Nathaniel Frank, 12/10/12Author, \u0027Unfriendly Fire: How the Gay Ban Undermines the Military and Weakens America\u0027The Bible, both the Old and New Testaments, actually contains two different kinds of sin. One is an act considered morally wrong because it\u0027s hurtful or dangerous. The second kind of sin is a violation against social conventions. Which kind of sin is homosexuality, according to the Bible?Read Post | Comments (386)Derek Shearer, 12/06/12Professor of Diplomacy at Occidental College and former US ambassadorThis holiday season, I\u0027m most grateful for President Obama\u0027s hard fought win at the polls.

Professor, Univ. of Missouri, Kansas City; Sr. regulator during S\u0026L debacleThe New York Times\u0027 slant in describing Monti as a \"technocrat\" and Correa as a \"left-leaning economist\" is typical of the dominant media. Monti and Correa both have doctorates in economics from U.S. universities and both have been professors of economics. Why does the New York Times treat Monti reverentially and Correa dismissively?Read Post | Comments (136)Kathy Freston, 12/09/12Health and Wellness Activist, AuthorThis is empowering news, given that most people think they are a victim of their genes, helpless to stave off some of the most dreaded diseases.
