{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor of The American ProspectPresident Obama did two things in his address at George Washington University that he has been loath to do throughout his presidency. He spoke like a progressive partisan. And he spoke of that great unmentionable in centrist Democratic policies -- the injuries of class. The progressive framing of the issue could blow the Republicans back to the fringe, minority position they were in when the financial collapse occurred and Obama won election. Well done, and long overdue.Read Post | CommentsDean Baker, 04.18.2011Co-Director of the Center for Economic and Policy ResearchWe have extensively tested both parts of the Ryan transfer program, and they don\u0027t work. Thanks to Ryan, we have the Republican Party on record as supporting massive transfers to the wealthy.Read Post | CommentsGara LaMarche, 04.18.2011President and CEO of The Atlantic PhilanthropiesThe U.S. is in a toxic political moment. For progressives, who recently thought that the political arc might finally be bending, it is beginning to seem clear that we have failed again at communicating a coherent and compelling worldview.Read Post | CommentsBill McKibben, 04.18.2011Author of a dozen books, including \"The End of Nature\" and \"Deep Economy\"The environmental movement has spent the last 20 years pleading with Congress. It\u0027s like pleading with the cashier to address your complaint. Sooner or later, you have to take your problem to the manager.Read Post | CommentsMelinda Gates, 04.18.2011Co-chair, the Bill and Melinda Gates FoundationStillbirth is a devastating occurrence for families.

John Conyers, 04.18.2011Dean, Congressional Black CaucusNo one likes to pay taxes, but most Americans understand our country is stronger because we collectively fund our national priorities.

Numbers and plans are thrown around in order to obscure rather than clarify the choices being made behind closed doors.Read Post | CommentsMichael Brenner, 04.18.2011Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghRobert Gates\u0027 tenure as secretary of defense has bracketed a turbulent period in American politics only to be resurrected at death\u0027s door by heavy doses of steroids provided by the victims.Read Post | CommentsChief Rabbi Lord Sacks, 04.17.2011Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the CommonwealthThe message of Passover remains as powerful as ever.

Steny Hoyer, 04.18.2011Tax reform can help us get out of debt, but only if we keep the tax code progressive and apply some of the savings we get from closing loopholes to paying down debt.Read Post | CommentsRob Stein, 04.18.2011Founder, Democracy AllianceRespect for others, tolerance of difference, civility and comity, dialogue and deliberativeness are valued and effective leadership strengths, regardless of what the more bellicose among us may think.

Yet Wes Craven\u0027s return to the world of Scream is not only a relatively unnecessary franchise revival, it wears its uselessness on its sleeve.Read Post | CommentsGeorge Lakoff, 04.17.2011Author, The Political Mind, Moral Politics, Don\u0027t Think of an Elephant!In 2008, candidate Obama laid out traditional American moral principles as well as anyone ever has, and roused the nation in support. As president, as he focused on pragmatics and policy, he let moral leadership lapse. But that changed last week.Read Post | CommentsLaurie David, 04.18.2011Producer/Author/NRDC TrusteeIt\u0027s hard to shock me, but when I read the report on Friday that almost half of the meat and poultry we\u0027re buying at our local grocery stores is contaminated with Staph bacteria, I had to let out a scream of frustration.Read Post | CommentsGary Hart, 04.18.2011Scholar in Residence at the University of ColoradoPermitting a temporary tax cut to expire as the original law provided is not raising taxes.

Some are amusing, but after a while they leave a bad taste in the reader\u0027s mouth. Should a teacher be this condescending?Read Post | CommentsPaul Carr, 04.17.2011British author, columnist, hotel-dwellerAt Absinthe, there are no nets, no safety cables and certainly no face protectors, either for performers or audience.
