{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"APSigns of trouble and Judy Miller were like Mary and her little lamb. Everywhere that Judy went, a flashing warning sign was sure to follow. Today’s WaPo quotes a damning December 2000 memo sent by Craig Pyes, a two time Pulitzer winner who had worked with Miller on a series of Times stories on al-Qaeda. It’s the journalistic equivalent of Dean telling Nixon that Watergate was \"a cancer on the presidency\"...READ POST | comments10.17.2005 Rep. John ConyersIn an era of fake reporters, government paid pundits and federally funded propaganda, forgive me if it does not seem implausible that a reporter would receive quasi-official status. These questions need to be answered.READ POST | comments10.17.2005 David SirotaThere are the ideological voices on the right, and capitulating politicians - but no similarly loud ideological voices - on the left. What that leaves us with is an unbalanced debate - and no progressive pressure system.READ POST | comments10.17.2005 Larry BeinhartThe media just goes ahead and covers it as if it’s a macabre video game in which the generic insurgents have no motivation, no goals, no politics. All they want to do is pop up and shoot at our guys.READ POST10.17.2005 Rebecca PidgeonThis week’s download is a song I wrote called, “Cigarette,” and is inspired by this theme in Anthony Powell’s great novel, A Dance to the Music of Time.READ POST10.17.2005 Martin GarbusThe First Amendment test deals with realty – the need for information to uncover and prosecute a crime against the need to protect journalist sources. Miller seems unable to understand reality – a bad trait for a journalist.READ POST10.17.2005 Danielle CrittendenLadeezMan42: man she mus b sum hot chick Kickass43: harriet?? rofl LadeezMan42: how else a chick like dat get SCOTUS Kickass43: its not like dat dudeREAD POST | comments10.17.2005 Jamal SimmonsBefore Miers, Thomas was the least qualified person to ascend to the court in generations and conservatives decided that he would do just fine. Why the difference?READ POST | comments10.17.2005 Eric BoehlertWhat Miller, and to a degree the Times reporters, conveniently omit is the fact that Libby was clearly one of the pre-war sources Miller relied on as she hyped the administration\u0027s line about WMD\u0027s.READ POST | comments10.17.2005 Ed SolomonIt\u0027s almost as if she\u0027s doing a sociological study of herself with herself as an object of observation whom she doesn\u0027t really know personally. I think it\u0027s total bullshit.READ POST | comments10.17.2005 Michael ShawThe American media may be completely oblivious to its own country\u0027s military maneuvers and methods, but the photographs can hardly contain themselves with the size of the clues.READ POST | comments10.17.2005 Peter MehlmanFirst of all, as Chief Justice, I just assumed I was the boss and like all bosses, I could bring in my own people. But no. I have eight judges under me and can’t fire any of them.READ POST | comments10.17.2005 Bob CescaPresident Bush, in his usual nearsighted process for filling vacancies -- and without the help of Karl Rove -- chooses his dog Miss Beazley to be the new vice president.READ POST | comments (18)10.16.2005 Jim WolcottBill Keller and Pinch Sulzberger seemed to have taken the lessons of the Jayson Blair fiasco and strove to do a lousier job protecting the integrity of the Times.READ POST | comments10.16.2005 Jane HamsherYeah you are PRETTY clever, Judy ol\u0027 gal. Get yourself a deal to preserve your \"principles\" by punking your lawyer and getting him to sell one of the toughest attorneys in the country a bill of goods.READ POST | comments (26)10.15.2005 Bill DiamondStung by a 33% drop in the sale of new vehicles, American auto makers are scrambling to find new markets for their products.READ POST | comments (24)10.16.2005 Hooman MajdCondoleezza Rice’s short trip to European capitals and Moscow, partly a mission to drum up support for referring Iran’s nuclear dossier to the U.N. Security Council, is in all probability a failure.READ POST | comments10.17.2005 Ari MelberJudy Miller obviously has a lot more explaining to do to her editors. It’s past time for the whole story, and they’re not going to wait for her book.READ POST | comments10.17.2005 Sam HarrisI am one of the few people I know of who has argued in print that torture may be an ethical necessity in our war on terror. In the aftermath of Abu Ghraib, this is not a comfortable position.READ POST | comments (12)10.16.2005 Cindy SheehanI would love to support Hillary for President if she would come out against the travesty in Iraq.
