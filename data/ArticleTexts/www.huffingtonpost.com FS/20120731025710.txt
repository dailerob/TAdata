{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Two weeks ago, I told you about HuffPost Live 3, 2, 1, where you can sign up to be a guest on our new livestreaming network when it launches August 13. The response has been tremendous: hundreds of you have recorded a video sounding off on what you are passionate about. Many of you have also taken part in the rehearsal segments we are doing to help our hosts, our producers, and the HuffPost community get ready. One of our goals with HuffPost Live is to provide a platform to people whose voices aren\u0027t normally heard in the traditional media -- to offer a seat at the table around which the national conversation is taking place. And that\u0027s been happening. People from all walks of life have joined in on a wide range of lively conversations. You should too. So check out HuffPost Live 3, 2, 1 and join the conversation!Read Post | CommentsRobert Kuttner, 07/30/12Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027You can be confident that markets will slump again and Spanish and Italian borrowing costs will rise again as soon as investors realize that Draghi, despite his best intentions, can\u0027t quite deliver.Read Post | Comments (82)Martin Bashir, 07/29/12Journalist, Host on MSNBCAlthough Mitt Romney spent just a few short hours in the United Kingdom\u0027s capital city, he may well come to rue the day that he decided to accompany his wife Anne, and her horse, on their trip to the Olympics.Read Post | Comments (1,377)Lisa Belkin, 07/30/12Senior columnist for life/work/family, The Huffington PostHow to reconcile these two contradictory goals? To teach our girls that females are awesome and also teach them that their gender is not the whole of who they are?Read Post | Comments (274)Lopez Lomong, 07/30/12Olympic Runner, Team USAYes, I think of winning Olympic gold, representing the USA and expressing my appreciation for all that this country has given to me in blessing upon overwhelming blessing.Read Post | Comments (15)George Lakoff and Elisabeth Wehling, 07/30/12America is divided about its future. Should it keep and expand the system that brought past opportunity, prosperity and freedom? Or should it dismantle that system?Read Post | Comments (50)Marty Kaplan, 07/30/12Director, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolNo wonder media outlets maximize political drama. It holds audiences, and that\u0027s great for the bottom line. But there is zero civic virtue in paying attention to campaign coverage.Read Post | Comments (22)Robert Reich, 07/29/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Romney\u0027s camp hopes to out-negative Obama by almost two to one. So whatever happens on Election Day, the next president will have to contend with two handicaps.Read Post | Comments (712)Mark Hyman, MD, 07/27/12Practicing physicianWhile we are wired to love food and derive great pleasure from the act of eating, somehow our love affair with food has become an abusive relationship.Read Post | Comments (45)Michael Smerconish, 07/30/12Radio hostElizabeth Warren said it better than Barack Obama. And the president\u0027s presentation wasn\u0027t helped when supporters of Mitt Romney edited his words. Sadly, lost in a squabble over \"you didn\u0027t build that\" was the opportunity for a more serious conversation about social contracts.Read Post | CommentsVicki Larson, 07/28/12Journalist, mother, thinkerPerhaps instead of focusing on our kids\u0027 declared major, grades and degrees, we should be paying attention to their extracurricular activities.Read Post | Comments (668)Dean Baker, 07/30/12Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027The typical near-retiree has about $170,000 in wealth including everything, such as the equity in their home, their 401(k) and any other savings. That is what our CEO gang makes in a week.Read Post | Comments (193)Dan Froomkin, 07/30/12Senior Washington Correspondent, Huffington PostDoes any journalist who is not an overt shill for the right actually believe that Republicans are pushing voter ID laws because they\u0027re concerned about voter fraud? No, of course not.Read Post | Comments (410)Peter H. Gleick, 07/30/12President, Pacific InstituteAre you confused by the debate over fracking? I\u0027m not surprised. The public debate is complex, angry, boisterous, a mix of science intertwined with politics, and complicated by a lack of information (or even intentional disinformation) on all sides.Read Post | Comments (30)Chris Kelly, 07/30/12Writer, \u0027Real Time with Bill Maher\u0027When Mitt Romney talks about culture, he doesn\u0027t mean religion. He means the force that explains why some people have money (and deserve it) and other people don\u0027t. He\u0027s not talking about Arabs and Jews. He couldn\u0027t care less. He\u0027s on autopilot. But that\u0027s not what his audience is hearing.Read Post | Comments (13)Diana Nyad, 07/29/12Long Distance Swimmer, Journalist, BroadcasterIn ancient times, all wars around the world came to an abrupt hiatus for the duration of the revered Games. If only that were still the case. Nevertheless, it does seem that most of us drop life as normal to immerse ourselves in the many moments of drama.Read Post | CommentsLeo W. Gerard, 07/30/12International President, United SteelworkersIt\u0027s easy for Congress to show it cares about American security, the American economy and American manufacturing. All it takes is a vote to secure and upgrade a dam. And, you know, the rest of the nation\u0027s infrastructure.Read Post | Comments (64)D.L. Hughley, 07/30/12Actor and stand-up comedianUntil and unless we can have an honest national conversation about our violence-obsessed culture, we will always be waking up to mourning in America.Read Post | Comments (215)Jeff Jarvis, 07/30/12Author, \u0027Public Parts\u0027 and \u0027What Would Google Do?\u0027I still believe that if NBC gave the fans what they wanted rather than trying to make them do what NBC thinks it wants, NBC could win by growing audience and engagement and thus better serving sponsors. I ask you to imagine what Olympics coverage would look like if Google had acquired the rights.Read Post | Comments (67)Michelangelo Signorile, 07/30/12Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay Voices; SiriusXM radio hostThe news on Friday about Amazon\u0027s Jeff Bezos giving $2.5 million to the effort of marriage equality in Washington State marked a milestone. And here we are, in a media firestorm over this pipsqueak, Chic-fil-A?Read Post | Comments (408)William Hartung, 07/30/12Director, Arms and Security Project, Center for International PolicyThe old John McCain had an independent streak, bucking his party on issues like campaign finance reform and fighting Pentagon pork. Unfortunately, the old John McCain is fading from view just when the country needs him most.Read Post | CommentsMatthew Hutson, 07/30/12Science writer; author, \u0027The 7 Laws of Magical Thinking\u0027In general, if you\u0027re nice to people, good things come your way, but if you\u0027re jagoff, look out. These expectations make sense in social situations, where people can retaliate or return favors, and where reputation matters. But we expect the universe to play by the same rules -- to manifest karma.Read Post | Comments (11)John R. Talbott, 07/30/12Author, \"Survival Investing: How to Prosper Amid Thieving Banks and Corrupt Governments\"A simple list of Romney\u0027s policy positions makes it very clear who ought to be voting for the man.Read Post | Comments (383)Richard Grenell, 07/30/12Longest-serving U.S. Spokesman in the History of the United NationsBy the time President Obama visited Poland in 2011, former Polish President Lech Walesa declined to meet with him. It was a shocking rebuke for an American president by one of the U.S.\u0027 most thankful and supportive allies.Read Post | Comments (49)Stephan Salisbury, 07/30/12Author, \u0027Mohamed’s Ghosts: An American Story of Love and Fear in the Homeland\u0027In contrast to the exhaustive coverage of the massacre that left 70-plus casualties, we know very little about Anaheim and the killing of Manuel Angel Diaz, shot in the back and in the head by that city\u0027s police just a few short hours after the awful Aurora murders.Read Post | Comments (31)Michael Roth, 07/29/12President, Wesleyan UniversityRomano does offer a series of often intelligent reflections on a diverse group of American writers. That doesn\u0027t make his work or our country philosophical, but it does remind us of books we might turn to as we continue our conversations.Read Post | CommentsSally McGraw, 2012.31.07Renee Olstead, 2012.30.07Michael Smerconish, 2012.30.07Scout, Ph.D., 2012.30.07Alvin Lopez-Woods, 2012.30.07Jessica Arevalo, 2012.30.07Danny McCubbin, 2012.30.07Sam Fox, 2012.30.07BritChick Paris, 2012.30.07Adam McGibbon, 2012.30.07","h1":"ROMNEY: DISCUSS ISRAELI SETTLEMENTS \u0027IN PRIVATE\u0027",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in SportsYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in StyleYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalAOLConnect with your friendsMost Popular on HuffPostDon\u0027t Miss HuffPost Bloggers","h2":"Using a mobile device?
