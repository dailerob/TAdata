{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Planned Parenthood Action FundWomen won in Washington this week. The Obama administration\u0027s decision to protect the birth control coverage benefit that is part of health care reform will have a real and direct impact on millions of Americans. For women in America, this is a watershed moment. The birth control coverage benefit is one of the most important breakthroughs for women\u0027s health care in a generation.

The signs are everywhere.Read Post | Comments (185)Michael Hogan, 1/21/12Executive Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post Media GroupVisually stunning and boldly unorthodox, Beasts of the Southern Wild spins a fearsome and intoxicating tale of life beyond the borders of civilization, celebrating the sheer animal hardiness of the human species and raising troubling questions about what we sacrifice when we choose comfort and safety over courage and freedom.Read Post | CommentsVicky Ward, 1/21/12Contributing editor, Vanity FairMen leave women for younger women all the time. But because she tried to attack Newt at an obviously vulnerable and crucial moment for him, the tactic has backfired. The world -- or the world in South Carolina -- pities him.Read Post | Comments (122)James Zogby, 1/21/12President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Their marriages, their money, their irresponsible hawkishness and Islamophobia has resulted in producing a long-running embarrassment that, unfortunately, the whole world is watching.Read Post | Comments (168)Cristina Page, 1/21/12Author, \u0027How the Pro-Choice Movement Saved America\u0027There\u0027s another voice you must add to 16 \u0026 Pregnant: That of the 16 year-old girl who is pregnant and chooses to have an abortion.Read Post | Comments (62)Mary Fjerstad, RN, NP, MHS, 1/21/12Nurse practitionerThis month marks the 39th anniversary of the passage of Roe v.

We must treat causes -- what we eat, how much we exercise, how we handle stress, our social connections and environmental toxins are all more powerfully linked to creating health and preventing disease than any drug on the market.Read Post | Comments (72)Adora Svitak, 1/21/12Student, Author, Teacher, TEDxRedmond CuratorIt\u0027s too easy for audiences to pass me off as \"exceptional,\" \"a prodigy,\" \"gifted.\" The point of my work is to make it clear that all youth can make \"big miracles\" happen. We need a movement.Read Post | CommentsJoseph F. Coughlin, 1/20/12Director, Massachusetts Institute of Technology AgeLabThe sinking of public trust is integral to our faith in complex social and technical systems that undergird everyday life, our confidence in each other, and ultimately our belief that we can build a better future together.Read Post | Comments (18)Sharon Salzberg, 1/21/12Student of Buddhism, Meditation LeaderIs there a quality of happiness, is there a kind of peace that is not a compounded thing subject to change, to destruction, as conditions change?Read Post | Comments (83)Roko Belic, 1/20/12Creative Activist Member, Creative Visions FoundationThe greatest lesson I learned while making this film is that my pursuit of happiness is not about me.

Gardinier, 1/21/12Freelance producer, editor and writerIf asked, Newt Gingrich would obviously say no, in his arrogant, \u0027you\u0027re asking me a ridiculously stupid question\u0027 sort of way, but it sure sounds like he is lately. And if he is, he may be doing the \"right\" thing politically.Read Post | Comments (101)Jenee Woodard, 1/21/12Creator, TextWeek.comI was thinking about another time when things didn\u0027t work out so well on Christmas. ...
