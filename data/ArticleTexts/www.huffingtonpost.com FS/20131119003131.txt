{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Howard FinemanEditorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupPolitical dramas in the nation\u0027s capital usually partake more of Scandal or SNL than of Shakespeare, but we may need the Bard\u0027s unrivaled eye for profound family discord to tell the full story of the Cheneys right now. There are more than a few similarities between former Vice President Dick Cheney and King Lear: old men obsessed with the loss of power, attempting to pass their kingdoms on to ambitious daughters, each served by a loyal Fool for whom he cared to a pitiable degree. Cheney\u0027s even had the (White House) court jester\u0027s name of \"Scooter.\" Like Lear, Dick Cheney seems destined to watch his family torn apart by his daughters\u0027 ambitions and beliefs -- and his own hubris.CommentsBob CescaManaging Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowRep. Michele Bachmann (R-MN) appeared on CNN and complained that she\u0027s going to lose her insurance because of Obamacare. Bachmann is clearly very frightened about the prospect, but it\u0027s mainly because she\u0027s totally confused about how exactly to sign up.CommentsHeather SpohrWriter, philanthropist and blogger, The Spohrs Are MultiplyingIt\u0027s only natural to look to the future with hope for a better tomorrow. Happily, the seeds of that tomorrow can be seen in the minds of 2013\u0027s most brilliant kids. Here are three wunderkinds who promise to be on the cutting edge of innovation for a long time.CommentsJeffrey SachsDirector, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \"To Move the World: JFK\u0027s Quest for Peace\"Many progressives will no doubt say that I\u0027m being unfair to the Keynesians, and that they too would favor an investment strategy if the Republicans didn\u0027t block them. I hope that\u0027s true. Yet Keynesian stimulus repeatedly takes our eyes off the long term.CommentsCarly SchwartzDeputy National Editor, The Huffington PostGrowing up with a stay-at-home mom was something I took for granted as a kid and teenager. I could care less that she was the last person I saw before school started and the first person I talked to when it was over.Comments (14)Meg Waite ClaytonBestselling Novelist, \u0027The Wednesday Sisters\u0027 and \u0027The Wednesday Daughters\u0027After I read in the New York Times that The Golden Notebook author Doris Lessing, who won the 2007 Nobel Prize for Literature, passed away this morning, I turned to rereading some of her writings and interviews. I hope you\u0027ll enjoy these little wisdoms I\u0027ve collected.CommentsPablo EisenbergSenior Fellow, Georgetown Public Policy InstituteWhere have all the billionaires gone? Their philanthropy is now needed more than ever, yet their giving, especially to needy constituencies, remains paltry, often nowhere to be found.Comments (307)Michael E. MannDirector of Penn State Earth System Science Center; Author of \u0027Dire Predictions\u0027 and \u0027The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars\u0027Satellite images along with readings of ocean heat seem to suggest that Haiyan was an unnaturally powerful storm. The science is hinting that this storm may not have been so catastrophic in a world without warming.Comments (160)Kerry KennedyPresident, Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human RightsI\u0027ve been asked again and again how I will be marking this anniversary. When it comes to my Uncle Jack, my father, or any other loved ones we\u0027ve lost, I believe in honoring lives, not deaths.CommentsMohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOCEOs and other leaders, in the corporate world and beyond, should do more than follow the news on the Affordable Care Act (ACA or Obamacare). They should also ask themselves what they would do if they were in President Obama\u0027a shoes.CommentsPaul RieckhoffFounder, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of AmericaSurvivors have shown tremendous courage in telling their stories. Now it\u0027s time for the Senate to show courage and pass the Military Justice Improvement Act.CommentsRobert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The ancient Greeks liked to say that character is fate. The colossal mess that Obamacare has become reflects both the character of the legislation and that of the president who sponsored it.Comments (770)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Walmart could learn a thing or two from Henry Ford, who almost exactly a century ago decided to pay his workers three times the typical factory wage at the time. The Wall Street Journal called Ford a traitor to his class but he proved to be a cunning businessman.Comments (450)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkIs it okay to highlight website problems? Yes. Is it okay to push the president to get these tech issues resolved quickly? Absolutely. But when did having website problems become the same thing as not sending enough help to those dying and suffering in the midst of a devastating hurricane?Comments (17)John TirmanExecutive Director, MIT Center for International StudiesThe Hillary Clinton bandwagon is running at full steam. With all the usual cautions about three years being a very long time in politics, there are other reasons to question this inevitability -- or, more to the point, the advisability -- of electing Hillary Clinton as president.Comments (48)Salman KhanI started Khan Academy to help my cousins in math while my day job was being an investment analyst. It didn\u0027t take long, however, to realize that the same tools I was using to explain math could be helpful in finance as well.CommentsKellyNoel WaldorfDuke University seniorIn my four years at Duke, I have tried to write this article many times. But I was afraid. I was afraid to reveal an integral part of myself. I\u0027m poor.Comments (65)Miles KimballProfessor of Economics, University of MichiganGrit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals. But that is not enough. Grit also comes from having a vision, a dream, a picture in the mind\u0027s eye.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorLet\u0027s ponder this kludge put forth by the president to let you keep your non-group plan if you so desire. It\u0027s just not that simple, and understanding why not is important for understanding why this part of the ACA is built the way it is.CommentsJames ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027In each case, parties on all sides continue to overreach operating under the illusion that through the application of more violence the \"other side\" can be destroyed once and for all -- with good triumphant over evil. In reality, what recent history has taught us is that there is no ultimate victory.Comments (105)Amb. Marc GinsbergFmr. U.S. Ambassador to Morocco \u0026 White House Middle East AdviserNovember 10 will not go down as a stellar day for U.S. diplomacy. The premature faux hoopla over the scuttled first-stage nuclear agreement with Iran yielded little more than a legacy of miscues and a dozen eggs on Uncle Sam\u0027s face.CommentsJeff DanzigerPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideCommentsNoah MichelsonEditor, HuffPost Gay VoicesSeeing as I have some practical experience here, I\u0027d like to clear up a few things for those (presumably) non-c*cksucking straight men and anyone else who might be confused by these terms and/or when they can and should be used.Comments (62)Sen. Claire McCaskillU.S. Senator from MissouriA lot has to happen between now and then -- but when President Obama signs this year\u0027s annual defense bill, I\u0027m confident that it will be a watershed moment for justice in America\u0027s Armed Forces. We\u0027re on the cusp of legislative reforms that are nothing short of historic.CommentsLeo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersIn the radio version of Father Knows Best, the patriarch was an arrogant potentate. He would say, for example, \"What a bunch of stupid children I have!\" That is how Republicans have always regarded workers. Now they\u0027ve revealed they feel the same way about CEOs.Comments (103)Sarah KooimanBlogger at thearenaupdate.comWe all lead busy lives. Between work, family responsibilities, hours wasted playing Candy Crush and the time needed to edit and post Pulitzer-worthy photos on Instagram, who the heck has time for housework?Comments (11)Paul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostAs Secretary Kerry said a the roll-out for The State Department\u0027s Office of Faith Based Initiatives, \u0027We ignore the role of religion at our peril.\u0027Comments (22)Norman SolomonAuthor, \u0027War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death\u0027At this pivotal moment, progressives should not leave the messaging battle about the ACA to right wingers and Obama loyalists. While critiquing the law for its entanglement with the profit-voracious insurance industry, we should fight for quality healthcare for everyoneCommentsOlivia ColePoet, author, and activistEvery day we are bombarded with movies and television shows in which white families are plugged as the \"default\" experience... and no one would say that these films are about race. What USAToday\u0027s tweet reveals is that white audiences are unable to see black people as beings separate from their blackness.Comments (80)Lubomir KavalekInternational Chess GrandmasterIndia is paying tribute to two great sportsmen. Sachin Tendulkar, 40, known as \"God of Cricket,\" will retire after his last test match that started on Thursday. The world chess champion Vishy Anand, 43, is defending his title against Magnus Carlsen, 22, in his home city of Chennai.CommentsKyle AshSenior Legislative Representative, GreenpeaceI\u0027m not asking Obama to be as brave as the Arctic 30. But if Obama had truly internalized what he says in his climate speeches, I believe he would be activist about his legal abilities to do something about it.CommentsSusan J. NapierProfessor of Japanese Studies, Tufts UniversityIn The Wind Rises and in his essay last summer Miyazaki is forcing his viewers and readers to confront a nasty truth about the human condition. War can be exciting -- stirring up visceral emotions to an intensity we don\u0027t often feel in our normal lives.CommentsAlex Hayden DiLalla, 2013.18.11Keo Nozari, 2013.18.11Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, 2013.18.11Jaleh Bisharat, 2013.18.11James Altucher, 2013.18.11Steve Westly, 2013.18.11Robert Slayton, 2013.18.11John Seager, 2013.18.11Rose Stanley, 2013.18.11Chava Tombosky, 2013.18.11Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"THE GREEN RUSH",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BizYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
