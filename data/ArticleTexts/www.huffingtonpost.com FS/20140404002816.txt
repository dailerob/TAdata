{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jon SoltzCo-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranWith news that another shooting tragedy has hit Ft. Hood, my heart is breaking for the families of those who were wounded and killed by a gunman who is said to have purchased a gun off-base, brought it on to the base, and unleashed carnage. While many details are still unknown, it is too early to talk about what may have triggered this incident and what, specifically, could have stopped it. But even when we do know all the details, until civilian law matches military law on guns, we unfortunately must brace ourselves for the possibility of more of these tragedies.These kinds of subtle connections, floated out in headlines, ledes and in repeated questions to experts in endless cable news coverage, result in reinforcement of stigma and a lost opportunity to educate viewers and readers on what mental illness and PTSD really are.Mark JoyellaEmmy Award-winning journalistIf you\u0027re a billionaire looking to buy political influence, this is your month. But if you\u0027re anyone else, the news is not good. In its McCutcheon v. FEC decision yesterday, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 to strike down the overall, or \"aggregate,\" limit on direct campaign contributions.Marge BakerExecutive Vice President for Policy and Program, People For the American Way \u0026 People For the American Way FoundationBut what kind of company did the government save? One that waited a decade to recall millions of cars with a lethal defect that would shut down engines without warning. One that chose not to replace the defective part, an ignition switch, when it was first detected. It would have cost less than $1 a car to do so.Ben HallmanSenior Financial Writer, The Huffington PostI, too, went to Harvard, and years later (when I least expected it), I was raped. Ever since that day in April 2008 -- when I was pushed into the mud by a violent 15-year-old boy -- I\u0027ve been thinking a lot about how our society handles the problem of rape.Winnie M LiWriter, producerExxonMobil, in negotiations with shareholder activists that led to withdrawal of their shareholder proposals, agreed to report to shareholders on climate change. I hope scientists the world around will deconstruct the edifice ExxonMobil has erected.Bevis LongstrethFormer SEC CommissionerWe strongly believe that it is time -- and not too late -- for the United States to apologize for the war in Iraq.Desmond TutuMpho TutuBy taking Citizens United one step further and effectively eviscerating campaign finance laws, the Court has issued an invitation to oligarchy.Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027If you know that by getting to the front of the line you are able to see or anticipate some material number of the trades that are about to happen, you are GUARANTEED to make a profit. What is the definition of a rigged market? When you are guaranteed to make a profit.Mark CubanOwner, Dallas Mavericks; Chairman, AXS TVAnswers to this puzzle are more known than is generally appreciated. Taking an approach that identifies and addresses risk and protective factors in violence, whether it be directed against the self or others, is one thing we can do right now.Lloyd I. Sederer, MDMedical director, New York State Office of Mental HealthWhen I married my husband in 1991, I was in my late 20s and my husband was, well, a few years younger. It wasn\u0027t a massive age gap but -- as the years went on -- I\u0027d be lying if I said I didn\u0027t think about it from time to time.Shelley EmlingSenior Editor, HuffPost 50How much of human productive activity can be moved to \"near zero marginal cost\"? Jeremy Rifkin\u0027s provocative new book poses the question to our future. The case for \"near zero marginal cost\" in the digital world is pretty clear, as Rifkin so ably explains.Banning GarrettStrategic Foresight Senior Fellow for Innovation and Global Trends at the Atlantic CouncilIn writing the state budget, New York legislators totally capitulated to the billionaire-funded charter industry. The bottom line is that when billionaires talk, the New York legislature and Governor Cuomo listen. Actually, they sit up, bark, and roll over.Diane RavitchResearch Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027I haven\u0027t seen one person ask the most important question: What does this mean for the American people and the government that is supposed to work for them? The discussion centers totally around the \"game\" of politics, and who wins and loses among the players. No one asks, \"How do the people fare?\"Dan GlickmanSenior Fellow at the Bipartisan Policy CenterThe inaugural challenge attracted submissions from 23 states across the nation, as well as the District of Columbia. Three winners were chosen based upon the following criteria: originality and innovation, business model approach, experience of team, potential scalability of business, potential for return on investment, and social impact.Tavis SmileyPBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorNadia TolokonnikovaMasha AlyokhinaOne compelling way to look at this ruling is by contrasting its immediate and long-term effects with the American people\u0027s aspirations for their government. They are at cross purposes. Even before this ruling, 64 percent of those polled believed that our country\u0027s economic rules unfairly favor the rich. This ruling will rig the game even further.Richard (RJ) EskowSenior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourSo what happens if, or when, you become a victim of tax identity theft? If you know for certain that your identity has been compromised, the IRS has a form for that. But if you\u0027ve already lost your tax refund to an identity thief, their reporting mechanism may not be enough to resolve your existing case.Adam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911On issue after issue, party leaders spew egregious factual falsehoods. They\u0027re doing so only secondarily because they are so often misinformed. Instead, their overriding goal is to appeal to what they understand to be the biases and prejudices of their evermore authoritarian base.Jonathan WeilerDirector of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel HillDancing requires physical awareness, precision, rhythm, soul, memory and coordination. And whether people realize it or not, modeling and dancing are two closely related disciplines. Both require you to use your body, know your body and express with your body.Naomi CampbellModel, Actor, Activist, Mentor and Executive Producer of The FaceAs an Englishman I\u0027d like to congratulate the Supreme Court of the United States for bringing America one step closer to monarchy.Matthew ChapmanWriter/director, \u0027The Ledge\u0027; Author, Trials of the Monkey\u0027; President, ScienceDebate.orgThe notion that there is one soul mate for everyone is ludicrous. If you expand the definition, a soul mate doesn\u0027t even have to be romantic. My best friend is a soul mate; my son is a soul mate; a man I knew but never even kissed is a soul mate.Evelyn LauerChicago-based writer and teacher, working on a memoir about loveWhat\u0027s truly great about Wallflowers is that it balances gay and straight storylines effortlessly, in the process portraying what our actual lives are like.H. Alan ScottWriter, Comedian, ManMichael ShawPublisher of the visual politics and media literacy site, BagNewsNotesAIDS is largely seen, in the United States at least, as something that happened, rather than something that can or will -- more polio than cancer, more Vietnam than Ukraine.Nick LiebermanStudent at Columbia University, Son of Marilu HennerYou don\u0027t know me. You have no clue that my family has gone through the wringer. You have no clue that we have faced unbelievable hardship. You know none of this but you didn\u0027t let that stop you from being compassionate and generous to someone you have never met.Andrea GardnerMom, teacher, bloggerOne of the conundrums of this particular moment is that the winners in our American world are exactly those who have repeatedly been playing the losing hands. Their reward for one self-defined disaster after another has been yet more money, yet wider areas of everyday life to control, and yet more power.Tom EngelhardtEditor, TomDispatch.comIt is embedded in the fabric of so many mothers to instill this idea that anything is possible for their children, by being willing to do everything they can to get those kids on the right path.Monique ColemanActress and 2010 United Nations Youth Champion for the International Year of YouthIn this video, Diane Ravitch and I talk about the problem with charter schools being run by billionaires, celebrities and individuals with no experience in education; the fact that taxpayers are increasingly funding religious schools and why hedge-fund managers see education as an emerging market.Bill MoyersManaging Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyThe new Republican budget would condemn America to economic decline, undermine the American Dream, and shred the social compact. By rigging the game in favor of the wealthy and privileged special interests while dismantling the ladder of opportunity for everyone else, it violates the fundamental promise that every hard-working American should have a fair shot at success.Rep. Chris Van HollenCongressman representing Maryland\u0027s 8th DistrictThe executives at GM knew for 13 years that their cars had a defective ignition switch that would, well, kill people. But they did a \"cost-benefit analysis\" and concluded that paying off the deceased\u0027s relatives was going to be cheaper than having to install a $10 part per car.Michael MooreOscar and Emmy-winning DirectorGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"LATER!",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
