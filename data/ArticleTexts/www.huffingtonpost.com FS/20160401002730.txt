{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"No matter who we are, we share a common need for sleep. Though this need has been a constant throughout human history, our relationship to sleep, and our understanding of its vital benefits, has gone through dramatic ups and downs. And right now that relationship is in crisis. At the same time, we\u0027re living in a golden age of sleep science -- revealing all the ways in which sleep and dreams play a vital role in our decision making, emotional intelligence, cognitive function, and creativity. I wrote The Sleep Revolution to examine this ancient, essential, and mysterious phenomenon from all angles, and to explore the ways we can use sleep to help regain control over our out-of-kilter lives. The goal of the book is to move us from awareness to action. So I hope you\u0027ll be inspired to renew your relationship with sleep -- in all its mystery and all its fullness -- and join the sleep revolution, transforming your life and our world one night at a time.The sources of this story never asked for money.

Yet the impacted families are forever changed. Terror anywhere affects all of us in our interconnected world.Founder and CEO of AcumenIt\u0027s long past time for journalists to demand their freedom from Trump press pens. Escaping from the pens represents a simple way for news organizations to assert their obvious right to cover the Trump campaign on their own terms, rather than being penned in at campaign events and living in fear of having access denied if coverage is deemed to be too critical.Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaIf you are struggling with complicated grief.
