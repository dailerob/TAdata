As expected, the GOP, unable to run on its disastrous record, played the fear card. Leaping on Obama\u0027s defense of the rule of law (dear god, not that!), the Republicans pulled out their 2004 playbook and opened it to \"Scare Tactics.\" Newt Gingrich said supporting habeas corpus could lead to the obliteration of a U.S. city. Rudy Giuliani (surprise) evoked 9/11 a bunch of times. John Bolton predicted an Obama presidency would lead to more terrorist attacks. And John McCain lapped it up. Buying into the 2004 mindset, House Democrats promptly removed their gonads and capitulated on telecom immunity and Iraq war funding. That, more than the fear-mongering of the right, is what sent a shiver down my spine.Read Post | CommentsBIOMarty Kaplan, 06.20.2008Nancy Pelosi, Stenny Hoyer and the blue dogs they lie down with have been rewarded with the same herpetic embrace that is turning John McCain into a Republican cootie incubator.Read Post | Comments (508)BIODavid Weiner, 06.16.2008Cindy McCain is up to her old tricks.

He\u0027s just saying once gas gets to five bucks, screw it. It\u0027s every plant and animal for himself.Read Post | Comments (168)BIOGary Hart, 06.16.2008Here\u0027s a modest proposal: all of us who support Barack Obama for president should now wear flag pins.
