{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Diversity Visiting Professor, University of San Francisco; and Scholar Writer in Residence, MLK, Jr. Institute, Stanford UniversityRelations between police and African-American communities across our country may be at its worst since the 1960s. What do public officials in the police department in Ferguson fear? When the shooting of Mr. Brown by a white police officer occurred, word spread. There was some limited violence and rioting, which was quickly contained by the leaders in Ferguson. The demonstrations on national TV Wednesday evening were initially peaceful and disciplined. Police subsequently fired tear gas and rubber bullets into them -- that is when some acts of retaliatory violence occurred. Ferguson is reminiscent of some of the worst confrontations between the African-American communities and police nationwide. I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just; that his justice cannot sleep forever.We will be able to stop Ebola in the coming weeks and months. But that is not the end of the story. Will we also build a strong enough health system to stop the next outbreak? We believe that it is a moral and economic imperative to do so, and all of us must work toward that goal.President, World Bank GroupChairperson of the African UnionOnce again, I wonder why it requires death to grapple with our legacy of racism and the continuation of institutionalized racism that criminalizes black and brown bodies. When can we accept the pattern before us and move forward to change it?Attorney, BloggerThe murder of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, on Saturday night and the subsequent outcry over police tactics carried out by a force often indistinguishable from an occupying army have brought heightened scrutiny to the militarization of American policing.Director of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel HillAs a white person in the U.S., I am conditioned from birth to see whiteness as safety -- white neighborhoods, white people, white authority figures. My lived experience, my conversations with people of color, and my study of history have shown me over and over that this is a wild and cruel perversion of the truth.Senior Minister, Church of the Larger FellowshipOver the past five days in Ferguson, Missouri, after the tragic killing of unarmed teenager Mike Brown, the police and local government have shown a lack of understanding of the First Amendment\u0027s protection. Your job is to PROTECT those who have grievances with our government.Editor-In-Chief of GlobalGrind.comWelcome to a new era of American policing, where cops increasingly see themselves as soldiers occupying enemy territory, often with the help of Uncle Sam’s armory, and where even nonviolent crimes are met with overwhelming force and brutality.Journalist/WriterSeaWorld, as we know it today, is over. It\u0027s only a matter of time. The company is finished. Here\u0027s why.Co-founder of the Huffington PostPolice in general get a bad rap, and the vast majority are good, loyal souls. But their training and the institutional mentality they come from often leads to a warped perspective of how they function within communities that they do not live in.Founder, GlobalGrind.comUnlike the victims of the Gaza conflict, whose charred bodies fill the feeds of social media in Western countries, these dead are part of a war you don\u0027t see.Novelist, Arts \u0026 Humanities Research CouncilToday marks 79 years since President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed Social Security into law on August 14th, 1935. Today, our Social Security system celebrates nearly eight decades of ensuring basic economic security for America\u0027s workers and their families when wages are lost as the result of death, disability, or old age.Founding Co-director, Social Security WorksProfessor of Social Work, Syracuse UniversityFor these acts and images to do more than express the release of anger over one more senseless killing is still another textbook example of America\u0027s racial and class polarization.Publisher of the visual politics and media literacy site, BagNewsNotesSocial Security has already received the best possible birthday present: its advocates don\u0027t have to play defense anymore.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourHere lies a racial disparity that\u0027s difficult for honest people to ignore. How can black people openly carry a real gun when we can\u0027t even pick up a BB gun in a store without arousing suspicion? The answer in America is that the Second Amendment doesn\u0027t really apply to black people.CNBC contributor, MSNBC commentator and former White House aideWhen I finally saw the final movie with the music in there, it was kind of overwhelming. It was a very gratifying experience to see that it was done with such regard for the book. It retains the essential ingredients of the book, while adding all of the visual stuff that a movie needs but that a book sadly cannot have.Author, \u0027The Giver\u0027White Americans like me have to stop channel surfing all the outrageously bad news from around the world and focus on the death that is happening in our own cities to our fellow Americans.Executive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostWhen 66 percent of the American people do not approve of a president\u0027s foreign policy, something is awfully wrong with 1) the policy; 2) the selling of the policy; 3) the staffers formulating the policy. Betting on the remaining 34 percent who approve -- the isolationist fringes of both parties -- represents a dangerous sliver on which to bank a national security legacy.Fmr. U.S. Ambassador to Morocco \u0026 White House Middle East Adviser/CEO of Peaceworks LLC \u0026 The OneVoice Movement FoundationWe should care a great deal about the Ebola outbreak, but not for the reasons propagated by cable news. We should care about Ebola for what it says about the current state of the health care system in resource-limited settings around the globe.Assistant Professor of Emergency Medicine, Brown Medical SchoolThe police reaction -- to protests of their own violence -- has been more violence, less transparency, and an active suppression of first amendment freedoms. The police and government of Ferguson must be held accountable, and we call on the Department of Justice to take immediate action.President, DemosFour months after defense lawyers first told a Guantanamo military commission that they\u0027d learned the FBI was spying on their colleagues, it remains unclear who or what the FBI was investigating. What is clear is that it will continue to delay progress in the case of the five men accused of masterminding the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.Senior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstThere\u0027s always room for fine tuning our eating habits. Here are 25 ideas to boost nutrients, cut empty or excess calories, eat more sustainably, or all of the above.Author, \u0027Best Lunch Box Ever\u0027; registered dietitian, mother of three; Raising Fresh-Food Kids in a French-Fried WorldIn a world filled with cutting satire and brutal parody and subversive deconstruction, he was one of those comics who really believed the purpose of comedy was to make people happy, to help people forget.\u0027Jeopardy!\u0027 champion, voice-over artist, actor, comedianI could spend plenty of time running through the list of items that anger me about this terrible event, but I have not seen enough content that simply takes a moment to grieve Michael Brown, so I hope that this post merely functions as a small form of grievance for the loss of a young man who did nothing to provoke or call for the cruel end to his life.Writer, Communications and Startup Women Initiative Manager at UP GlobalThe possibility of being imperfect -- of making mistakes -- without dire consequences is in some respects the very definition of privilege. For only some groups need to fear that they may trip the wire of state-sanctioned violence at any moment.Associate Professor of Law, University of Miami School of LawIt\u0027s said that the best defense is a good offense. This strategy probably lies behind Hillary Clinton\u0027s recent takedown of President Barack Obama\u0027s foreign policy. After all, Clinton was a lead architect of that policy as Secretary of State, and the policies that she espoused until recently now lie in shambles.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \"To Move the World: JFK\u0027s Quest for Peace\"As Albert Camus wrote, \"Good intentions may do as much harm as malevolence if they lack understanding.\" Whatever Ms. Brown\u0027s intentions are, they lack an understanding of both the current landscape of teaching in high-needs schools and of educational research. It\u0027s time to get some facts straight.Assistant Professor, Urban Teacher Education at Michigan State UniversityAssistant Professor and Deputy Chair in the Department of Puerto Rican \u0026 Latin@ Studies at Brooklyn College (City University of New York)There has always been a deep right-wing vein in Missouri, which has taken hold in recent years, seen through Todd Akin\u0027s \"legitimate\" rape lunacy.Author, political writer, relationship expert.The United States can help, but only if officials in the White House and Congress put politics aside and approach this refugee crisis with intelligence and bipartisan commitment. The practical reality is that tens of thousands of children have crossed the border into our country, and we owe it to them, and to ourselves, to treat them with the fairness, compassion, and due process.U.S. Senator from ConnecticutI served as a crew commander in the Israeli artillery corps at the beginning of the Second Intifada, and I feel compelled to counter this claim from Israel.Former Crew Commander, Israeli Artillery CorpsThe disturbing nature of the frequency of recent news reports in which unarmed Black men have been killed by law enforcement officers is only exceeded by this fact: the act itself is deeply embedded into the racial fabric of our nation.Author, \u0027FREESTYLE: Reflections on Faith, Family, Justice, and Pop Culture\u0027; Founding Pastor, Joy Tabernacle A.M.E. Church, Dallas, TexasChildhood development guides tell us that 2-year-olds traditionally begin to exhibit growing independence and openly defiant behavior.
