{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Founder, People for the American WayBrian Williams puffed up a story he was telling to make himself look better. He puffed up his part of the tale, and in the manner of a young boy, he lied. Now, we can revel in seeing his image shattered. Or, we can examine our individual humanity and perhaps find the small child in ourselves that has been inflating his or her grown-up image for years, puffing up a moment here or there -- a test score, an athletic feat, a hint of danger and our \"survival.\" Yes, Williams is a newsman and an anchor and holding him to the highest standard goes with the territory. But he\u0027s a human first, and drastic ironies and imperfections come with each of us in that territory. Wouldn\u0027t we be a gentler, more educative culture if, instead of wallowing in Williams\u0027 shame, we treated it as an opportunity for all of us to discuss and examine the nature of the humanity we have in common?We\u0027re actually happiest when we\u0027re absorbed in a difficult task, one that challenges us not only to exercise our talents but to stretch them. And yet, given the opportunity, we\u0027ll eagerly relieve ourselves of the rigors of labor.Author, The Glass Cage: Automation and UsSince the end of the nineteenth century, the movement for a critical reflection on the foundations and interpretations of Islam has lost momentum, impeded by the predominance of a sclerotic, Arabo-centric Islam based on an obsolete worldview and often dismissive of non-Arab Muslims.Founder, The Atlantic DinnersFmr. Vice Prime Minister of Malaysia, head of the national opposition and chairman of the World Forum for Muslim DemocratsFounder, The Atlantic DinnersPresident of the World Conference for Religions for PeaceAny deal that forces women and human rights to take a backseat to profit and trade should be a non-starter. But right now, the United States is negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade agreement with 11 nations including Brunei, a country that recently adopted a vicious new penal code threatening the rights and lives of women, lesbians, and gay men.President of The Feminist MajorityCulture, like so much of American life, is being shaped by rising income inequality. Art, which was the domain of a democratic, sometimes anarchic spirit, has become a preserve for the cool display of privilege.Columnist for Esquire Magazine and the author of The Hunger of the Wolf.That\u0027s right, a guy who last year made $25,000 an hour speculating and flying around on a corporate jet, is furious that someone who works 40 hours a week pouring concrete, laying hot asphalt and fixing potholes -- serious physical work -- makes as much all year as he does in two hours.Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersSome Alabama probate judges, at least for the time being, are defying the United States Supreme Court today, refusing to grant marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples while other judges throughout the state are granting those licenses.Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesEnergy security was high on the agenda of world leaders in 2014. Governments all over the world are now trying to come up with plans to ensure stable energy supply. Our quest for energy security must go hand in hand with the quest for true security. Our addiction to fossil fuel is taking us on the road to nowhere.Executive Director, Greenpeace InternationalMalcolm X faced the kind of racial determinism that many students of color have become accustomed to today. Proponents of high stakes testing resurrect such determinism, presumably without the racial overtones, by reducing students, their hopes and dreams for the future, to test scores.Historian, professor, education activist and author of Teaching US History Beyond the Textbook (2008)The true State of the Union, and the state of the world, in 2015 can be described in one word: precarious. Despite our wealth, our technological knowhow, our global social media, we are a world at war with each other and with the planet itself.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia UniversityArtificial superintelligence is coming, probably whether we like it or not, and probably within our lifetimes. If many of the experts are correct, this will either be our greatest dream or our worst nightmare. Here\u0027s why.waitbutwhy.comIt didn\u0027t take long for the Guantanamo military commission in the 9/11 case to stumble again -- this time when two of the accused co-conspirators said they recognized a translator in the courtroom from their time in a CIA black site.Senior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstPeople think that Brian Williams is the problem because he exaggerated a war story about Iraq? Are you kidding me? The whole war was based on a monstrous lie that almost the entire media enabled and perpetuated. That\u0027s the real problem.Host, \u0027The Young Turks\u0027Much the same argument for the sharing economy was voiced in the late nineteenth century over alleged \"freedom of contract.\" Any deal between employees and workers was assumed to be fine if both sides voluntarily agreed to it. It was an era when many workers were \"happy\" to toil twelve-hour days in sweat shops for lack of any better alternative.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Typically, pro-gun activists are coy when confronted about their perverted belief that the Second Amendment provides an individual right to shoot and kill government officials in response to perceived \"tyranny.\" But last week, a threat that is so often implicit was made perfectly explicit by a leader in Texas\u0027 open-carry movement.Executive Director, Coalition to Stop Gun ViolenceSave your mental energy for productive tasks, such as solving problems and setting goals. When your thoughts aren\u0027t productive, make a conscious effort to shift your mental energy to more helpful topics. The more you practice expending your mental energy wisely, the more it will become a habit.Psychotherapist and author of 13 Things Mentally Strong People Don\u0027t DoMoussaoui\u0027s testimony makes that position even less sustainable. Mr. President, release the 28 pages. We can handle the truth.SiriusXM Radio HostIf you believe in America, then there really is no excuse for not spending $900 million and joining the great American experiment that is our democracy. You see, $900 million may sound like a lot of money. But according to the Supreme Court, it\u0027s not. It\u0027s a lot of speech. The Koch Brothers understand this.Staff writer, Jimmy Kimmel LiveSince a substantial minority of Republicans actually believe that the president is a Muslim, he can\u0027t be the one to challenge them on this issue. Muslim-baiting will not end until a Republican leader steps forward and takes on the likes of Jindal or Palin or Bachmann.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027For years people have been running around Washington yelling that the United States was at risk of becoming Greece. There may actually be a basis for such concerns, but not for the reason usually given.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027What about drinks for the rest of us, the grumpy curmudgeons and sad singles of the anti-Valentine\u0027s vanguard?Liquor.comI\u0027m joined by actor Eddie Redmayne, the Golden Globe-winning and Academy Award-nominated star of the hit film The Theory of Everything, which portrays the story of real-life theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking. In the clip, Eddie shares how his own outlook on life has changed after having interacted with Hawking and others impacted by ALS.PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorInstead of staying laser-focused on the very real, very complex and very dangerous consequences of the outcome of the negotiations with Iran, the public discourse is now being hijacked by politics.National Director, Anti-Defamation LeagueEver since Bruce Lee died, much of our self-confidence as Asian Americans has died along with him. Today, it feels like we have no Asian heritage to embrace. We no longer view martial arts or Eastern philosophy as our own. And most of us would feel uncomfortable embracing Bruce Lee\u0027s spiritual side.Editor, TypeZen.com: \u0027Going with the Flow in a Type A World\u0027The one-year increase in wages has been only 2.2 percent, barely more than 1 percent when adjusted for inflation, and it\u0027s been a long time since most workers have seen substantial raises. In this recovery, the economy has been creating more low-wage jobs than high-wage ones. The shift from standard payroll jobs to temp and contract work continues.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027We have become a profoundly unequal society. Unless we can build momentum for a new political agenda, we\u0027ll be divided into a small minority with fabulous wealth and a permanent underclass with few hopes or prospects. Unfortunately, our mainstream political dialogue shows no sign of adapting to these realities.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourThe IT revolution has us all entangled. Most of us are enraptured. The younger you are, the more likely to be in this latter category. It is like that with all dramatic social innovations. Habit is resistant to change; the older you are the more entrenched your habits.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghThe chief justice of Alabama\u0027s supreme court is making a stand in the courthouse door. This is not literally happening, the way it did in 1963 when Alabama Gov. George Wallace made a similar stand in the schoolhouse door. But in both cases, high Alabama officials are trying to preserve the state\u0027s ability to discriminate against a segment of its population.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comNo one is suggesting that Christians are just like the Islamic State. But Obama did suggest that Christianity is like Islam; both faiths have the capacity to be exploited by extremists.Author, Evolving Dharma and God vs. GayMy girlfriend has been asked if she was my nurse. Once, a person blankly asked if she was \"the one who takes care of him.\" We\u0027ve gotten used to this bizarre, recurring question, and often find ways to poke fun at their ignorance.Author, Columnist and BloggerThe Bank of Canada would be wise to consider the future we\u0027re heading towards. For a petro-economy such as Canada\u0027s, where the energy industry and the country\u0027s economic well-being are closely linked, the financial risks associated with the pending battle against climate change are much greater than any cyclical downturn in oil prices.Former Chief Economist, CIBC World MarketsGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"NEW HOLES IN O\u0027CARE CHALLENGE",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
