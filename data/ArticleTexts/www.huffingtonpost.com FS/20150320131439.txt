{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteAmerican foreign policy is controlled by fools. What else can one conclude from the bipartisan demand that the U.S. intervene everywhere all the time, irrespective of consequences? No matter how disastrous the outcome, the War Lobby insists that the idea was sound. Any problems obviously result, it is claimed, from execution, a matter of doing too little: too few troops engaged, too few foreigners killed, too few nations bombed, too few societies transformed, too few countries occupied, too few years involved, too few dollars spent. As new conflicts rage across the Middle East, the interventionist caucus\u0027 dismal record has become increasingly embarrassing.A mass abduction that was seen a year ago as unprecedented -- sparking justifiable outrage across the world -- now seems, after a series of further kidnaps, to look like a sadly increasingly familiar tactic in the terrorist arsenal.Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationI\u0027m frequently asked the loaded question of how much I am madly in love with Walter. I mostly give the questioner what they want with a nod of assent. But the truth of my emotion is more complicated. I think maybe the problem is with how I have, up to this point, understood the word \"love.\"Executive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostThere can be no real peace with honor if women are left out. Without women at the table, women\u0027s rights will be an empty promise if peace is ever negotiated.Money Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsThe tragic discovery of a missing African-American man\u0027s body hanging from a tree in rural Claiborne County, Mississippi is now being investigated by both state and federal authorities.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityWhile Obama has slowly stepped up transferring detainees already cleared by a multi-agency process for release from Guantanamo to other countries, his administration has dragged its feet on reviewing the 51 detainees who aren\u0027t yet cleared, out of the remaining 122.Senior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstThe college admissions mania that gets worse and worse every year is a mirror of America: anxious and stratified.Author, \u0027Where You Go Is Not Who You’ll Be: An Antidote to the College Admissions Mania\u0027The choice isn\u0027t between the wrong-headed austerity of sequestration and the failed austerity plan of Simpson-Bowles. Congress must choose to be on the side of women and their families, and against cuts in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.President, National Organization for WomenNYU might in the past have been able to claim that the UAE\u0027s crackdown on freedom of expression was of no concern to them but the denial of entry to one of their own professors and his classification as a security risk skewers that argument.Middle East researcher, Human Rights WatchIn this new American production of the Japanese classic, 47 Republican senators play the roles of the 47 ronin. They too deliberately defy the shogun, played with equanimity by President Obama. But the American ronin are out to kill a policy, not a person.Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogObamacare was supposed to make birth control free for all women. But that reality is still far off.Editor, HuffPost BusinessDanny Collins isn\u0027t just about showbiz. It\u0027s about family, regret, second chances, friendship, inspiration, perseverance, and artistic integrity in a film where all of the actors give some of their best performances I\u0027ve seen in years.Gentleman farmer, film critic for ReThink ReviewsThe International Day of Happiness will be more than just a fun celebration, it will also help to remind us all that the world is a better place when we connect with and care about the people around us.Director of Action for HappinessLet me be free. Let me be me! Don\u0027t make me old, with your thinking and words about how I should be. You don\u0027t have to come to my shows. I am giving tremendous energy with my voice, because that is me. Get my energy or shut up.ArtistWhat is needed is a systematic pro-social economics, that combines appreciation for the common good and for others as well as for the service of self.Professor of international relations, George Washington UniversityMost Israelis now believe that they need to choose between security and democracy, and the Israeli electorate has spoken clearly: It prefers security. As a result, Netanyahu is about to form the most extreme right-wing government in Israeli history without a centrist party that serves as a fig leaf and provides international legitimacy.Professor of Psychology and Philosophy, Tel Aviv UniversityThere\u0027s no doubt that I\u0027ve had my share of tears. But once I was able to look past my self-pity, focus on the positive opportunities and outcomes, I began to persevere. I hope that my past might provide insight into your future.Author, \"Live or Die: A Stroke of Good Luck.\" www.liveordieburns.comGood defense will force those who want to surveil us to choose their targets, and they simply don\u0027t have the resources to target everyone.Author, Data and Goliath; Fellow, Harvard Law School\u0027s Berkman Center for InternetThe belief that the US will effectively pressure the Israeli government to negotiate in good faith is now dead; with it should die the idea that the US must be in charge.Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicyThis week not only did President Obama become the first American President to suggest Mandatory Voting in the US but it was also when Oregon became the first state to institute automatic registration... and Israel had a national election with a turn-out nearly 50% higher than ours. Could this become Obama\u0027s second term legacy idea like Ike\u0027s \"military Industrial Complex\"?Host, \u0027Both Sides Now\u0027How does the brain change as we age, and what steps can we take to help our brains stay healthy as time goes by? In answer to my questions, Claire Sexton, a post-doctoral research assistant at the Oxford Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain, elaborated on some of her latest scientific findings and offered some tips on how to improve the quality of our sleep.Starbucks\u0027 ill-conceived campaign seems to exemplify the kind of ignorance that makes racism such a difficult thing to confront and contest. The bottom line is that while we absolutely need multiracial dialogue about race and collective action against racism, we do not need an uninformed, non-consensual, conversation.Writer and sociologist.What is oddest about opposition to action to address climate change is the implications for another priority of the Republican party: deficit reduction. The bury-your-head-in-the-sand approach won\u0027t make extreme weather events driven by a changing climate go away, but it will ensure that our response is uncoordinated, less proactive, and far more expensive.U.S. Representative for New York\u0027s 12th District; Ranking Democrat, Joint Economic CommitteeI left that day almost the same way I came in. Except my feelings of joy, gratitude and respect had grown, and my feelings of sadness and dread had almost, but not completely, disappeared.Writer, Blogger, Creator of, My dishwasher\u0027s possessedFor all the deception and evasion that permeates this year\u0027s House and Senate Republican budgets, one thing comes through clearly: The Republicans have no interest in the well-being of seniors or the disabled.

What I am thankful for is quite different than the average person.Chronic Illness Advocate/Blogger Chronicallyawesome23.blogspot.comThe \"People\u0027s Budget,\" which I helped draft, strikes a strong contrast with the Republican plan. It rewards hard work and invests in our country. It ensures that everyone has an opportunity to get a good education, find a good job, live in a safe and secure home, put food on the table, have affordable health care, save for retirement and maybe have a little left over.U.S. Representative for Illinois\u0027s 9th congressional districtTwo years ago, in March, my younger brother died, quite unexpectedly. He\u0027d been my only sibling and, both of our parents being gone, the only other person in my original family. His daughter had asked my daughter to tell me the news.Professor Emerita, Women and Gender Studies at U.C.
