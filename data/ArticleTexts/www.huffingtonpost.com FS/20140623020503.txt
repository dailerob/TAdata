{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This was a week that saw the return of former leaders with less than successful results. In the World Cup, Spain fell 2-0 to Chile, knocking the defending champions out even before the upcoming knockout rounds. In an even worse reappearance, former Vice President Dick Cheney appeared on Fox News to defend his assertion that President Obama has \"been so wrong about so much.\" But host Megyn Kelly scored a surprise knockout herself when she said, \"History has proven that you got it wrong as well in Iraq, sir.\" As they say: \u0027Goooooooal!\u0027 Meanwhile, on Wednesday, the Patent Office canceled several trademarks on the name \"Washington Redskins.\" Though D.C.\u0027s football team hasn\u0027t changed its mascot yet, if they do, I\u0027m partial to renaming them the Washington Drones. Other suggestions that came my way on Twitter include the Watergators, the Lobbyists, the Super PACers, the Gerrymanders, the Filibusters and the Weasels. Tough to choose when they all seem so apt.No elite voice in this country seems capable of coming to terms with the fact that the Iraq war was \"lost\" the moment it was launched. It was lost because it was based on lies and deception.Professor, historian, authorIt is an established, and pretty boring, routine by most candidates of both parties, but especially on the right, to run against \"Washington.\" That is, even when one\u0027s own party is running \"Washington.\"United States Senator (Ret.)Why are American children and teens 17 times more likely to die from gun violence than their peers in 25 other high-income countries combined? When will we all say enough? We can and must do better.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundCould Scotland be the pacemaker for nationalist breakaways in Spain, Belgium, Italy and Eastern Europe? And could it demonstrate, as victories for anti-immigrant parties did in last month\u0027s European elections, that even the most advanced industrial nations are not immune from nationalist or protectionist movements?Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationIf something is wrong in one part of our life, it will consume our thoughts. We are good at hiding this and being productive regardless, but it\u0027s still there, nibbling at the back of our minds until we can get home, collapse on the couch and give it our full attention.Journalist, blogger, rugby player and college student, while maintaining sobriety.Relitigating the past is obviously painful for those who were so terribly wrong, and whose actions led to what is arguably the most egregious foreign policy error in the history of our country. But it is necessary as we consider the way ahead.Retired AmbassadorIf we continue to advocate for some people being treated as \"less than\" others in any way, how can we claim the Gospel as our mandate with any credibility?Author, editor, speakerWorkaholism is more than a dedication to your job. It\u0027s a near-obsessive commitment that supersedes most, if not all, other aspects of life. For many, workaholism is a true addiction, inextricably tied to feelings of self worth and identity.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarThe sustainability of Israel as a homeland for the Jewish people has always been dependent on its ability to deliver justice to the Palestinians. We learned in South Africa that the only way to end apartheid peacefully was to force the powerful to the table through economic pressure.Archbishop Emeritus of Cape TownCalling the war a \"mistake\" is the language of denial, not contrition: it minimizes the Iraq War\u0027s disastrous consequences, removes blame, and deprives Americans of any chance to learn from our generation\u0027s foreign policy disaster.Fmr. 16-year Member of US Congress; Two-time US Presidential CandidateOver the course of our respective careers it has become clear to us that there are two critical factors that can change the current landscape: improving access to capital for women-owned businesses, and creating structures to better enable women entrepreneurs to get the resources and networks they need to thrive.U.S. Senator for New JerseyCEO and Designer, Tory BurchAs James Harrington, lawyer for Ramzi bin al Shibh, told the court on Monday: \"We now have to represent to our client that we had a spy within our team for a number of months. We don\u0027t know what activities that spy did.\" Will Harrington\u0027s client ever trust his defense team again? Should he? And if he can\u0027t, can he ever truly receive a fair defense?Senior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights First\"We\" may not have \"lost\" Iraq, but can there be any question that Washington lost in Iraq? American goals in the region went down in flames in a fashion so spectacular, so ignominious, that today nothing is left of them. To the question, \"Who won Iraq?\" there may be no answer at all, or perhaps just the grim response: no one.Editor, TomDispatch.comIn all those years of play dates and sleepovers, I never had anyone ask me about my guns, and I never asked anyone else about theirs. I didn\u0027t think to ask. I would have never let my child go there if I had known they had guns lying around unsecured.Spokesperson for the ASK Campaign to prevent gun violenceWhen my son and daughter were both born with Down syndrome, I knew the likelihood of receiving even one college acceptance letter may not be a reality. But the day John received his letter of acceptance from the Special Olympics I experienced the equivalent.Mother of two children with Down SyndromeA few weeks ago I was visited in my office by the chairman of one of the country\u0027s biggest high-tech firms who wanted to talk about the causes and consequences of widening inequality and the shrinking middle class, and what to do about it.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027I don\u0027t know the extent to which Court decisions necessarily reflect the prevailing mood, but if a new gun control bill comes back to Congress later this year, I\u0027m not quite ready to declare it dead.Mike the Gun GuyA woman\u0027s dress, marital status, and lifestyle do not inspire violence against women. Violence against women exists because the men in their lives -- single, married and strangers -- commit that violence. For the sake of humanity, stop blaming women.Lawyer, Speaker, Best-Selling Author of \"EXTREMIST\"As I have realized certain people in my life don\u0027t energize me, but enervate me, I find myself walking away from them slowly and without much attention being brought to it. This has been a big lesson.Author, \u0027Don’t Die With Your Music Still In You\u0027Across the country, consumers are demanding the right to know what is in their food, and labeling of genetically engineered food. It\u0027s a vibrant and diverse coalition: mothers and grandmothers, health libertarians, progressives, foodies, environmentalists, main street conservatives and supporters of free-market economics.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorThe whole mystery surrounding what he had been doing up there in the woods has been a distraction from the much more interesting mystery surrounding the man and his work: What does his writing provoke in us? How does it achieve its effect, and why?AuthorI love seafood -- from succulent scallops to salty anchovies, seafood is an increasingly popular meal in my own home and across the United States. Yet consumers searching for sustainable seafood will find very little information about the seafood they eat.Actor; board member, OceanaCEO, OceanaRun a Google search for great quotes about the summer season -- which officially begins tomorrow -- and you\u0027ll see exactly how differently (and personally) it affects all of us.Award-winning actress, author and activistWhile it was widely reported that Perry had likened homosexuality to alcoholism, it went almost unnoticed that the Texas GOP platform had removed its prior call to recriminalize homosexuality.

I let my mom take over my JDate account for one night.Author (All My Friends are Engaged) \u0026 Blogger (The Things I Learned From)Whereas Cheney could once rely on the Republican hierarchy and a US national media to take note, now the former vice president is now forced to scramble for hits on YouTube, his inane ramblings on foreign policy, the Obama administration and the crisis in Iraq competing unsuccessfully with the latest J-Lo album teaser and a video on how dogs react to humans barking.US Editor, The Huffington Post UKRecovery takes many forms and has many causes, but the common denominator is realizing the need for change. It\u0027s the most powerful and human ability -- the ability to be aware, to choose, to change, to recover (and repeat). It\u0027s essentially the will to grow every day.HuffPost Blog/Third Metric FellowScientists estimate that there are over 100,000 intelligent alien civilizations in our galaxy alone -- but we\u0027ve never heard anything from any of them. Here are 13 possible explanations for why.www.waitbutwhy.comThere are always a ton of comments made at a vegetarian\u0027s expense: \"Where do you get your protein?\" or \"You don\u0027t eat meat at ALL?!\" and \"Why are you doing this?
