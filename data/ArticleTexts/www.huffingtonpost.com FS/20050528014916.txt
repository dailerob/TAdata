We don\u0027t know what we\u0027re exiting from. We don\u0027t know what the situation is moving toward…. How do we know where we\u0027re headed, when we don\u0027t know where we are?Wow. Very existential. Very Zen koan. If a foreign policy disintegrates in the desert and no one hears it fail, what does this mean for our country and for our safety?Do you hear that? It’s the sound of one Greek gagging. I’ve just decided that I do have a litmus test for the 2008 Democratic nominee: someone who can utter, in plain English, an unambiguous, unequivocal sentence about Iraq.Read more05.26.2005 David SirotaHey, did you know that Congress just had one of the most important votes on the Iraq War since the invasion of 2003? No, probably not, because not one major American news outlet thought it important enough to tell you...read whole post | permalink05.27.2005 Adam McKayI believe in a strong military. I supported the incursion into Serbia. I support what we did in WW II and I support what we did in Afghanistan shortly after 9/11. But for the life of me I don\u0027t get the whole Iraq thing and how we\u0027ve all forgiven the mistakes made by our leaders that led to 100,000 Iraqi deaths and thirty thousand U.S. casualties. What am I missing? How is this cool? And how does it make me an acid-crazed hippy to question this?read whole post | permalink05.26.2005 Randall RobinsonIn the beginning, only America had nuclear weapons. Then, Britain. Now North Korea, India, and Pakistan. Soon, if not already, (according to the writer Arundhati Roy), Israel, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, South Korea, Cuba, Nepal, Germany, Bhutan, Mexico, Denmark, Lebanon, Sri Lanka, Bosnia, Singapore, Burma, Uzbekistan. Even Afghanistan, and then, sooner or later, and probably sooner, much sooner, private religious, ethnic, and racial armies, where all wounds are fresh and well-remembered.read whole post | permalink | comments (0)05.26.2005 Susan NessAttacks from both sides of the political spectrum usually mean that program content is balanced. However, in these darkly partisan times, the harangue from both the left and the right might falsely convince the public that there is something very wrong with PBS. That could lead to a reduction in the vital support that PBS enjoys in Congress, followed by crippling budget cuts by those who would like to eliminate PBS.read whole post | permalink | comments (4)05.26.2005 David CornLast week Pentagon spokesman Lawrence Di Rita said there were no credible allegations of Koran desecration, and, thus, nothing to investigate. Yet today Brigadier General Jay Hood disclosed there were 13 \"incidents of alleged mishandling of the Koran,\" and five were confirmed. It turns out that not only were there credible allegations, there were actual \"incidents.\" Would Di Rita care to explain this?read whole post | permalink | comments (0)05.26.2005 Rep. John ConyersFor the past year and half, allegations have persisted that the Bush Administration pressured intelligence analysts to reach foreordained conclusions and massaged raw data to make the case for war. According to the British Government, with respect to the American government\u0027s efforts to justify the war \"the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy.\" Didn\u0027t know about that? Here\u0027s why: according to a Congressional Research Service analysis(pdf), you would not have seen it on the cable news networks.read whole post | permalink | comments (3)05.26.2005 Jay GordonFor Heaven\u0027s sake, if you have children, do not use pesticides and if you use pesticides, don\u0027t have children. Most parks and school ball fields are sprayed with chemicals so toxic they should be illegal. Talk to your school officials and the local park and recreation people. If they fail to respond, write lots of letters. Children\u0027s lives are at stake.read whole post | permalink05.26.2005 Dan CarolBecause I am a tolerant sort, I am totally fine with the President or other political leaders being devout Christians, Jedi masters or anything they want. That said, I do think our political leaders have a solemn responsibility to disclose to the public which decisions they are making based on science, or their best judgment, or a gut feeling, or a belief in divine will and John’s Revelations. Just so we can know where these folks are actually coming from.read whole post | permalink | comments (6)05.26.2005 Richard BradleyThe audience for serious journalism is vanishing faster than the polar ice cap. Newspaper circulation is slipping away. Fewer and fewer people watch the evening news. Nightline is toast. Young journalists today aspire to run a blog, appear on VH1 to flack US magazine, or \"write\" for Maxim. If Hunter Thompson weren\u0027t already cremated, he\u0027d be spinning in his grave.read whole post | permalink | comments (3)05.26.2005 Torie OsbornCA Senator Sheila Kuehl called me yesterday to report she was looking out of her window at nearly 10,000 firefighters, nurses, teachers, and others protesting Schwarzenegger\u0027s special election. She was thrilled... AND there were nearly that many in downtown LA at the same time! God bless the nurses, who had the guts to start this anti-Arnold protest ball rolling.read whole post | permalink | comments (0)05.26.2005 Ralph NeasLet’s be honest. It was hard to stomach the Senate’s confirmation of Priscilla Owen to the federal appeals court on Wednesday. She doesn’t belong there and she\u0027s probably not the last bad Bush judge to get on the courts. But the deal that gave her the vote is still a resounding defeat for the radical right. If you have any doubts that the compromise that denied Senator Frist the ability to detonate his nuclear option was a defeat for the radical right, just listen to the weeping and gnashing of far-right teeth...read whole post | permalink05.26.2005 Marc CooperI’ve got a dose of that damn post-bipartisan depression. I confess to a certain disappointment that Dear Leader Frist didn’t get his chance to push the Big Button on Tuesday and go nuclear.

Philip Roth had a spoof on this three decades ago when he imagined the Christian Right outlawing male masturbation on the grounds that it was anti-life. At the time it seemed like slapstick comedy, now we are catching up with Roth\u0027s wildest fantasies.read whole post | permalink | comments (19)05.26.2005 Jerry and Joe LongNow pro-pre life flaks roam the land, insisting that “taxpayer dollars\" not be spent on “false hope” but on missile shields and drug wars -- while the President interprets back to back electoral majorities from the Supreme Court and Diebold as a mandate to define science and reason.read whole post | permalink | comments (12)05.26.2005 Geraldine LaybourneOn Tuesday, John Tierney in the New York Times presented a nuanced and seemingly logical argument entitled “What Women Want.” He told of an experiment in Pittsburgh where they gave men and women five numbers to add in their heads and they were paid for every correct answer. The women did great. Then they broke the groups into teams. The women did great. Then they asked, “Who wants to be in a tournament?” Even the worst performing men wanted to be in the tournament. And guess what…the women weren’t so keen. Even the best said no thanks. Tierney’s conclusion was women don’t like to compete.
