{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, Lance Armstrong finally came clean, telling Oprah: \"I\u0027m here to say \u0027sorry.\u0027\" Whole Foods CEO John Mackey offered regrets for comparing Obamacare to \"fascism.\" And former South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford announced a bid for Congress, saying: \"We all hope for redemption.\" But before there is redemption, there must be contrition -- something sorely missing from the prosecutors of Aaron Swartz who, just days after Swartz\u0027s suicide, defended their actions as \"appropriate.\" Also contrition-free: the NRA, whose inaccurate ad featuring the president\u0027s daughters was blasted as \"reprehensible\" by Gov. Chris Christie, among many others. And there was no contrition from House Republicans, who softened their stance on the debt ceiling while reserving the right to hold the economy hostage. Perhaps we do a hostage swap with them -- we get the economy back, they get Manti Te\u0027o\u0027s girlfriend.Read Post | Comments (47)David Bromwich, 01/19/13Professor of Literature at YaleThe answers given by Bigelow and Boal to justify the normalizing of torture in Zero Dark Thirty have been vain, wheedling, and dodgy. They are a clever pair of filmmakers, without political or moral depth, but here, perhaps more than they realized, they were playing with fire.Read Post | Comments (282)Howard Fineman, 01/14/13Editorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupJust because you beat Mitt Romney -- and John McCain before him -- doesn\u0027t mean you\u0027re a great president or even a particularly good one. President Barack Obama has proved to be brilliant at digital organizing and winning elections. But his presidency so far has been less than meets the eye.Read Post | Comments (778)Arianna Huffington, 01/15/13We often bemoan the fact that those in Washington who get it wrong never seem to be held accountable, and those who get it right (even if not right away) always seem to be marginalized. Well, President Obama\u0027s nomination of Chuck Hagel as Secretary of Defense is how the system should -- but seldom does -- work.Read Post | Comments (716)John Dear, 01/20/13Christian peace activist, author of \u0027Lazarus, Come Forth!\u0027 and \u0027A Persistent Peace.\u0027 www.johndear.orgDr. King\u0027s principles and methodology of nonviolence outline a path to social change that still holds true.Read Post | CommentsJohn Mackey, 01/17/13CEO, Whole Foods MarketI believe that, if the goal is universal health care, our country would be far better served by combining free enterprise capitalism with a strong governmental safety net for our poorest citizens and those with preexisting conditions, helping everyone to be able to buy insurance.Read Post | Comments (1,554)Peter Farrelly, 01/14/13Writer/directorWhat I\u0027m proposing is simple: Every human being should have the right to unplug. There should be laws, amendments, legislation. When you leave your place of business, you should be done.Read Post | Comments (907)Marian Wright Edelman, 01/19/13President, Children\u0027s Defense FundI have no doubt that Dr. King would be mounting a nonviolent poor people campaign to end rampant hunger, homelessness, and poverty today. Let’s honor Dr. King by our committed action to end child poverty and close the morally obscene gulf between rich and poor in our nation.Read Post | Comments (140)John Cusack, 01/14/13Makes filmsRecently, I sat down with George Washington Law School professor and constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley and my close friend Kevin McCabe to discuss WikiLeaks\u0027 impact on transparency, the government\u0027s response, and the comparison to the Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg.Read Post | Comments (219)Alan R.

Beyoncé\u0027s Pepsi deal was a serious lapse of judgment. And the White House tarnishes its own \"brand\" by selecting her to sing the national anthem at the inauguration, unwittingly boosting the beverage industry that is helping to drive the obesity epidemic.Read Post | Comments (681)Matthew Modine, 01/14/13Actor, Activist, Filmmaker, HumanistAs a nation we cannot be shackled to an archaic Second Amendment which is being shielded by a minority of Americans that demand the right to use weapons that are continually killing citizens across our country.Read Post | Comments (2,622)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 01/16/13Author, research psychologist and gender scholarWhile it\u0027s easy for parents to get angry at men like Lance Armstrong for letting kids down, situations like his present a great opportunity to talk to kids about dealing with disappointment. And about what it means to admire someone for a particular talent or skill versus what it means to consider a person a role model.Read Post | Comments (106)Alexander Tsiaras, 01/18/13Founder, CEO and Editor-in-Chief, TheVisualMD.comMy goal is to visualize life in all its glory.

Take a look at our nine dis-honorees.Read Post | Comments (542)Jonathan Weiler, 01/17/13Director of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel HillThe ESPNs of the world have made \"character\" an attribute of athletic worthiness every bit as important as how fast someone runs the 40, or how far one can hit a baseball. In the process, the sports media complex has appropriated for itself the mantle of moral arbiter.Read Post | Comments (36)Jim Wallis, 01/18/13Christian leader for social changeWayne LaPierre\u0027s statement \"the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun\" is at the heart of the problem of gun violence in America today -- not just because it is factually flawed, but also because it is morally mistaken, theologically dangerous, and religiously repugnant.Read Post | Comments (684)Marlo Thomas, 01/18/13Award-winning actress, author and activistHere\u0027s a look back at some of those more memorable days in American history, when an ordinary citizen became an extraordinary leader.Read Post | Comments (52)John W. Boyd Jr., 01/17/13Fourth-generation farmerWhat are you hunting that requires the need of a semi-automatic weapon -- an instrument used for military warfare? This defies common sense and it should be central during the gun debate. This kind of extremism is part of the reason I do not have an NRA membership.Read Post | Comments (1,969)Betty White, 01/16/13Actress, comedienne, singer, author and television personalityAnimals are near and dear to my heart, and I\u0027ve devoted my life to trying to improve their lives.

We have much less of a single moral guidepost and leaders are finding it increasingly difficult to act on their moral sensibilities.Read Post | Comments (249)Michelangelo Signorile, 01/14/13Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesWhatever you thought of last night, you\u0027d have to agree that it was another indication of how it\u0027s becoming harder and harder for anyone in public life to have any real credibility and still be living in the closet.Read Post | Comments (448)Lulu, 01/17/13Singer, songwriter and performerThere\u0027s so much music now that it\u0027s pretty impossible to hear all of it - but that doesn\u0027t stop me from trying. As we transition into 2013 and leave 2012 behind, I\u0027ll be taking much of the music from the last year with me.Read Post | Comments (45)Graham Nash, 01/14/13Singer-Songwriter, Photographer and ActivistIn my humble opinion, the judges\u0027 ruling, granting Manning a 112-day reduction in any sentence he might receive, is welcome but far short of true justice. If the military broke its own laws and President Obama even declared publicly that Manning had broken the law, then how can anyone say that this could be a \"fair\" trial?Read Post | Comments (145)Molly Davies, 01/14/13MotherMr. President, I am writing to you as a wife and mother of two young daughters, whose 34-year old husband, Matthew Davies, faces 10 years or more in federal prison for providing medical marijuana to sick people in California, even though he complied with state law concerning medicinal cannabis.Read Post | Comments (841)John Stamos, 01/14/13Actor and producerAfter my dad died, Jack and I didn\u0027t talk any more than we had before. We didn\u0027t see each other more often -- nothing really changed. But Jack became that important male figure in my life that I wanted to make proud.Read Post | Comments (133)Emma Gray, 01/16/13Associate Editor, HuffPost WomenMegan Fox is hot. Megan Fox\u0027s face is symmetrical. Megan Fox is kind of sad about being so hot. According to Stephen Marche, author of Esquire\u0027s outrageous new profile of the Transformers and This Is 40 actress, this is a complex problem requiring a thousands-of-words meditation and a completely unnecessary jab at Adele, Lena Dunham, Lady Gaga and Amy Adams.Read Post | Comments (306)Peter Scheer, 01/16/13Executive Director, First Amendment CoalitionAlthough the stock market yawned at Facebook\u0027s announcement of \"Graph Search,\" its new search service, with investors wagering it would only hurt smaller, vertical search services like Yelp and Linkedin, the truth is that it is potentially much more significant than that.Read Post | Comments (34)Mohamed A. El-Erian, 01/16/13CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOPaul Krugman is right: Japan is attempting a paradigm policy shift with potential systemic implications; and sustainability and success are not certain.
