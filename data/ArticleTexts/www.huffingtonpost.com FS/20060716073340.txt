{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"APFrom paloverde.orgFrom enronblog.comAPThis week, as the Middle East was erupting, we learned that one of the reasons antiterrorism funding to New York City and Washington, DC was slashed earlier this year is a monumentally flawed Homeland Security database of potential terrorist targets that includes \"national assets\" such as Old MacDonald\u0027s Petting Zoo in Alabama, the Mule Day Parade in Tennessee, and the Amish Country Popcorn factory in Indiana.
