{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressColumbia Journalism Review\u0027s Trudy Lieberman has written a lengthy lamentation on the state of our Social Security journalism, and finds that the media has performed a \"dubious role\" in shaping the debate over the program. \"Dubious\" in that media outlets have done a pretty awful job doing \"journalism.\" Moreover, bad journalism begets bad information begets bad decisions. This is why it\u0027s so appalling when journalists get marginal tax rates wrong -- people turn down raises. And then, the guy from Politico writes about how everyone in America is stupid.

Keegan, 04/18/12President, People For the American WayRepublicans seem to think they can get away with almost anything because their Election Day hopes will be saved by a bad economy.
