Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorConservative partisans (as well as many centrist Democrats) consistently assert that teachers\u0027 unions are bad for student outcomes, and if we want to improve such outcomes, we must diminish the impact of teachers\u0027 unions. Most recently, this negative role of unions was a featured assertion in a Republican primary debate. That claim smelled bad to me, as in I know of no body of evidence to support it. Maybe I missed it. So I asked some experts in this field and they confirmed my intuition. There is nothing like a well-established consensus that teachers\u0027 unions have any impact one way or the other on student outcomes. That doesn\u0027t mean teachers\u0027 unions are great for kids either. It means that when you hear a politician bashing teachers\u0027 unions on behalf of students, they\u0027re BSing.Without serious interest from mainstream media, and without billions in campaign funding, the Vermont Senator has been able to generate a nationwide groundswell of enthusiasm. Money can\u0027t buy enthusiasm, and money certainly can\u0027t buy a person\u0027s trust -- Sanders has an abundance of both.Columnist published in The Cleveland Plain Dealer, The Baltimore Sun, The Hill, Salon, The Jerusalem Post www.hagoodman.comThe benefits of parental leave extend beyond newborn health: When fathers take leave, they participate more in early child rearing, and that level of engagement continues after the leave ends.

It took a while, but I would overcome the \"ditzy blonde\" stereotype as the only female lawyer, though not the only woman, in the state house.U.S. Senator from MissouriThe prospective Israeli-Hamas truce presents a momentous opportunity, albeit in disguise, for all parties concerned to turn a new page in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and change its geopolitical and security dynamics, which succeeding Israeli and Palestinian governments could build on.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUThe insistence on keeping wages down, stripping away bargaining power from workers, forcing small business owners to pay taxes a year in advance, and cutting pensions will only hamper demand and lead to a deepening spiral of debt.Author and cultural theoristSelf-restraint is not a characteristic of the companies developing robotics for businesses that want to replace tens of millions of both white collar and blue collar jobs. Look at the latest factories, refineries and warehouses to illustrate what is coming fast. Even the work of lawyers is being automated.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorIf some people want to attack Planned Parenthood, that\u0027s their right.

Just as importantly, all children need to be exposed to a wide range of books that reflect the true diversity of our nation and world as they really are.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundSchool is an actual, legitimate rite of passage. You buy the lunchbox, the backpack, the new shoes and the socks that aren\u0027t brown on the bottom. You get their hair cut. You talk to them about rules and listening. And then you let them go.
