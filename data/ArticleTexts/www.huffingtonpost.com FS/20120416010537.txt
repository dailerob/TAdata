{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, North Korea suffered a major embarrassment when its missile test demonstrated how far the country has advanced in producing a weapon of mass dysfunction. On the campaign trail, Rick Santorum announced he was suspending his run for the White House, thereby avoiding what was shaping up to be an embarrassing primary trouncing in his home state. In dropping out of the race, Santorum said, \"We were winning in a very different way.\" You mean by losing? That is very different. In Florida, the man who killed Trayvon Martin was finally arrested and charged with second-degree murder -- yet another example of what is possible when people come together in a social movement to force an unresponsive system to act. And in Massachusetts, the state marked another year of its health care system. Happy 6th birthday, Romneycare! So sorry your father abandoned you. Let\u0027s hope your national cousin doesn\u0027t get the same shoddy treatment.Read Post | Comments (32)David Bromwich, 04/11/12Professor of Literature at YaleThe recent Supreme Court decision in Florence v.

Haass, 04/13/12President, Council on Foreign RelationsNorth Korea remains a serious military threat. It still possesses as many as a dozen nuclear warheads, proven short-range missiles, and a formidable conventional fighting force. It is as much an army with a country as vice-versa.Read Post | Comments (66)Hilary Rosen, 04/11/12Communications, media and political strategistThe only way that Mitt Romney will succeed in closing the wide gender gap between him and President Obama is if he stops pretending that it doesn\u0027t exist.Read Post | Comments (4,128)Tavis Smiley and Cornel West, 04/12/12Every month since 2001, the United States has lost an average of 50,000 good-paying manufacturing jobs.

But the fight\u0027s just begun, because the special interests immediately set out to win back what they lost when the reform became law.Read Post | Comments (248)Adam Winkler, 04/11/12Professor of Law, UCLAThe news that Florida prosecutors are bringing charges against George Zimmerman for the death of Trayvon Martin raises two questions: Will Zimmerman be convicted?

Sheldon Whitehouse, 04/10/12Democratic Senator from Rhode IslandIf the American people make their voices heard and put enough pressure on Congress, we can restore fairness in our economic system, do what\u0027s right for the middle class, and show that Congress can stand up to special interests.Read Post | Comments (234)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 04/12/12Author, \u0027Our Fathers, Ourselves.

Stone, 04/13/12Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoThe Affordable Care Act case is a perfect case for judicial restraint. If the states that brought the suit want to change the law, they can do it through the political process. That is the point of democracy.
