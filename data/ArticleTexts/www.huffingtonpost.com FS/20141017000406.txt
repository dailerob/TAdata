{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Military Correspondent, The Huffington PostEasy talk about \"boots on the ground\" grates on the senses. It seems an awfully cavalier way to talk about the American battle dead buried at Arlington and in cemeteries across the country. Of those I have known, in Iraq and Afghanistan and in other conflicts, each one was proud of being \"boots on the ground,\" serving his or her country, proud of what they were accomplishing. Weary, perhaps, but resolute in their determination to see the job done. None, needless to say, wanted to die this way. But they were willing, trusting that the decision to send them was a thoughtful, considered judgment necessary for the good of the country.We need to redefine wealth as the ability to make a decent living from the land and sustain it for the next generation. To grow crops for food and fuel while simultaneously enriching the soil upon which future crops depend. To support a family and a community.President of Farm AidFor those of you who are determined that we suffer and be held accountable for our mistakes, we can only say that the pain of knowing how deeply we wronged our son and not being able to sit down across from him and ask for his forgiveness is agony beyond all attempt to describe it.Leader, Local HIV/AIDS Outreach Team Leader \u0026 Affirming Hope LifeGroup at Overlake Christian Church in Redmond, WAIslam today is being cannibalized by cancerous strains of fundamentalist religious ideologies that are promoted by wealthy and powerful Middle Eastern countries extinguishing moderate hopes in the Muslim world.Many of these countries are considered American and Western allies.Author of \u0027The Secret Sky\u0027 and foreign correspondentMother, Wife, Stage IV Surviving\"I frankly think my wife did the typing, but I don\u0027t remember,\" David Greenglass told me. Without that testimony, the single most incriminating evidence against Ethel Rosenberg, she might well have been acquitted much less executed.Urban affairs correspondent for The New York Times; Author of \u0027A History of New York in 101 Objects\u0027In his recent meeting with Obama, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that he was \"committed to the vision of peace for two states for two peoples.\" That sounds nice. But if he\u0027d been pressed, Netanyahu might have admitted that the two states he had in mind were Israel and the U.S., not Israel and Palestine.Director, Foreign Policy In FocusIn human history, no practice has more profoundly advanced human understanding of the natural world than that of science. So it seems tragic, in the year 2014, that science should require a defense (by a comedy writer, no less).Staff writer, Jimmy Kimmel LiveFriends don\u0027t let friends start companies together... unless they\u0027ve tested and grown their professional relationship by collaborating first.Wharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027I really hope family members of victims of the 9/11 attacks weren\u0027t planning on attending the hearings scheduled at Guantanamo Bay this week. It would be completely demoralizing to someone who suffered personally from the heinous mass murders that took place 13 years ago to find that once again, all efforts to bring the five alleged perpetrators to justice had stalled, and once again, no one\u0027s allowed to know why.Senior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstThe greater we supported the corrupt government in Kabul and the more American troops we sent, the more the Taliban prospered. A similar dynamic is at play in Iraq. Consequently, without a change in American policy the cycle of violence in Iraq will continue its ghastly spiral.Senior Fellow, Center for International Policy; Board of Directors, Council for a Livable World; MatthewHoh.comWhat we need are family-friendly workplace policies, not giveaways that will encourage women to undergo invasive procedures in order to squeeze out more work for their beloved company under the guise of \"empowerment.\"Project Associate, Center for Genetics and SocietyAs we face a plague that could spread with the scale and devastation of AIDS, Congress is once again playing partisan and petty politics.Physician; founder of Gay Men\u0027s Health Crisis; wrote the first press reports about AIDSIt is nothing short of a travesty to allow another generation of Palestinians to grow up in a state of limbo, only so their corrupt leaders can ride on their backs and cry wolf about their plight while shamelessly enjoying the good life.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUWatching video evidence does not necessarily ensure a unified or accurate understanding of the facts of a case. In fact, how people watch evidence may exaggerate an \"us versus them\" divide already present in the legal system.PhD candidate in Social Psychology, New York UniversityAssistant Professor of Psychology, New York UniversityThis decision doesn\u0027t just disappoint. It is truly frightening for it vividly demonstrates the powerful grip that a handful of major chemical/biotech companies hold over our regulatory process.Chairman and Founding Partner of Just Label It, Chairman and Co-Founder of Stonyfield Farm, and Father of Three Yogurt EatersAfter writing books about the 1950 contest for the U.S. Senate between Richard Nixon and Helen Gahagan Douglas and, especially, Upton Sinclair\u0027s race for governor of California in 1934, not much could happen this year that would truly shock or offend me.Author, Blogger, Film ProducerAs a mom of two sons, I know the majority of men out there are appalled by the terrible epidemic of sexual assault on college campus. These young men are speaking out and standing up as leaders on campus and in their community.We\u0027ve seen amazing traction, and we couldn\u0027t be more thrilled to see the young men who are joining in the conversation about sexual assault through the #iAspire for Her Campaign.Philanthropist, Author, EntrepreneurTragically, despite extensive emergency preparedness planning and reports issued in the aftermath of 9/11, the anthrax attacks, SARS, and H1N1 flu, the world is still unprepared to fight Ebola.Public Health Editor, The Huffington Post; Former U.S. Assistant Surgeon GeneralWhile it may not be popular with fellow thugs, the Islamic State has managed to take over much of Iraq and Syria. Predictably, Washington seems more interested in assigning blame for the situation than dealing with it. Sen. John McCain, for instance.Professor of International Affairs, Penn State UniversityWe should stop obsessing about test scores and start obsessing about the health and well-being of children and their families. The gains would be far more valuable than a few points on a standardized test.Research Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027The recent data compromises at Kmart and JPMorgan are in no way similar, except they share a common enemy. And while free retina scanners are probably a stretch, biometrics -- the use of your biological data like fingerprints -- may well be the next \"less hackable\" thing.Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911This \"perfect storm\" of guns and cyber-stalking of women is an example of how Western culture, through both philosophy and Christian theology, works to normalize violence against women, and violence in the general culture.Professor of Theology, Chicago Theological SeminaryWith the world increasingly and economically beholden to China and Chinese business, China\u0027s globalization strategy has won dividends at home and abroad.Political Scientist, Professor, Author, \u0027China\u0027s Regulatory State: A New Strategy for Globalization\u0027The fact that Aerosmith has stayed together for 42 years and counting is impressive. Here, Joe explains what it takes to survive the turmoil inherent in being part of a rock \u0027n\u0027 roll supergroup.PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorYou describe something obviously heading for disaster and then add, \"What could possibly go wrong?\" Such is the Middle East today.Author of \"Ghosts of Tom Joad: A Story of the #99Percent\" and \"We Meant Well\"We sacrifice salary to adhere to an ethical code. Our stance on social issues is largely liberal, though our opinions paradoxically, and perhaps ignorantly, contradict themselves.Co-founder of The Be You Be Sure ProjectWe need to channel our frustration over Congress, and use our frustration to ask a more fundamental question: What would a strong, representative, effective Congress look like?sunlightfoundation.comThe Ebola outbreak currently devastating West Africa threatens the lives of not just those infected with the virus, but all who require medical care, whether treatment for malaria or prenatal care for a healthy pregnancy.Kolokotrones University Professor and Chair of the Department of Global Health and Social Medicine, Harvard Medical School; Chief of the Division of Global Health Equity, Brigham and Women’s Hospital; co-founder, Partners In HealthThe reality facing both sides will not change: There are spoilers in the U.S. and Iran who will try to torpedo a deal, no matter the details. Precisely because it is impossible to satisfy ideologues, they only way to defeat them is to have a deal in hand that both sides believe is a win-win outcome.Research Director, National Iranian American CouncilSomehow threatening to kill, rape or maim someone is different on a public forum than it would be in person and this particular case is important enough to go all the way to country\u0027s highest court for consideration.Richard Zombeck is a freelance writer for hire living in the Boston area and hangs out at www.zombeckink.comGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"NURSE MAY HAVE BEEN SICK ON 2 FLIGHTS",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
