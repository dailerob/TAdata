{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundSince the government was forced to shut down on October 1st, one of the most common refrains has been that some members of Congress are acting like children—or, more accurately, worse than most children. Even 5-year-olds understand that quitting the game and taking the ball home because the other team won’t give you your way is wrong. Extremist Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives continue to hold funding for the federal government hostage for the second week in a row, opposing a clean extension of government funding without conditions. Their actions as they refuse to do their constitutionally mandated duty are harming the economy and countless real children and families across the country.Comments (144)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Keeping the government running and paying the nation\u0027s bills should never have been bargaining chits in the first place, and the President and Democrats shouldn\u0027t begin to negotiate over future budgets until they\u0027re taken off the table.CommentsTEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"New York Times personal tech columnist David Pogue shares ten easy shortcuts that cut down on the time it takes to compose a text message, fill out an online form, and complete other everyday tasks.Comments (65)Jane HortonMilitary and political consultant, and proud Gold Star wife to SPC Christopher Horton, an Army sniper killed in action on September 9, 2011 in Paktyia, AfghanistanOften, we forget about our most sacred and vulnerable population -- those that have given the biggest part of them to the cause of freedom. Maybe it\u0027s time that our nation takes a cold hard look itself. Who are we? Who have we become?Comments (247)Matt WalshBlogger, talk radio host, father of twinsI\u0027ve wasted all of these words on food and sports, and now I\u0027m left with nothing in the English language that can even come close to communicating what it means to me to be a father.Comments (26)Linda BergtholdHealth policy researcherA surprising proportion of the American public still believes some astonishing lies about this law, and new lies are surfacing every day. The viral emails still exist and continue to circulate. This is a post about what you should believe about the ACA, how implementation is going, and what the law is actually doing.Comments (772)Paul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostThe themes and speakers at VVS2013 have the whiff of decayed ideas and diminished power. But the really horrible part of the event is the complete and utter lack of interest in the poor, the immigrants, and those on the margins -- you know, those people Jesus loved.Comments (443)Dylan RatiganNew York Times Best-Selling author, entrepreneur and formerly the host of MSNBC\u0027s The Dylan Ratigan ShowI have always believed that the size of the problem equals the size of the opportunity. And considering the obvious size of the problem presented by opaque election financing and extractive core systems, massive opportunities for reform surely surround us.Comments (55)Richard ParkerLecturer in Public Policy and Senior Fellow of the Shorenstein Center, Harvard Kennedy SchoolHere\u0027s my down-the-middle solution to the shutdown, which I offer as a professional economist: Suspend Obamacare and cut the budget -- just as House Republicans have demanded -- but do all the cutting in just the 80 or so congressional districts of the most ardent Tea Party members.Comments (98)Janelle HanchettBlogger, Renegade MotheringI will not harden you. I will not break you. I hold between my mama hands your giant gaping sensitive heart. I refuse to abuse it.Comments (102)BuiltLeanGet Lean \u0026 Stay Lean With Marc Perry\u0027s BuiltLeanDespite the skeptics, there is a rising agreement in the scientific community that small amounts of pesticides and other chemicals have negative effects on health.Comments (124)Barry LevinsonAcademy Award-winning director, screenwriter and producerWe might get past the debt ceiling crisis, the government shutdown, but the future of America is clear. We are no longer the wonder of the world. We exposed our ignorance, our ugly insensitivity. We are a petty people with a government that has ceased to function.Comments (192)Judy ShepardCo-founder, Matthew Shepard FoundationFifteen years ago we were in Fort Collins, Colo., at the hospital with Matt, praying for a peaceful end to his suffering. At that point we were aware that he would never wake up from the coma he was in as a result of the beating that he\u0027d received at the hands of then-unknown assailants.Comments (44)Rep. Keith EllisonCo-chair, Congressional Progressive Caucus; U.S. Representative for Minnesota\u0027s 5th DistrictIt takes 86 hours a week working in a minimum wage job to pay for an average two-bedroom apartment in Minnesota. That\u0027s 12 hours a day, seven days a week. It\u0027s no accident that real wages have declined while executive pay and corporate profits have climbed rapidly.CommentsArianna HuffingtonAs hotels vie for supremacy in what some industry insiders refer to as the \"battle of the beds,\" many are rethinking their priorities, knowing that the difference between a good and bad night\u0027s sleep could -- and should -- tip the scales when it comes to where a guest chooses to rest her head.CommentsSarah Degnan KambouPresident, International Center for Research on WomenThey are great in number, these girls; they belong to an exploding population of youth worldwide -- the largest in history. And these girls are bubbling with untapped potential that will continue to be squashed unless we put them at the center of global development efforts in the coming decade.CommentsBrian KrewsonR\u0026D engineer; bloggerImagine the company you work for held a poll and asked everyone if they thought it would be a good idea to put a soda machine in the break room. Some said no, but the majority said yes. So, a week later, there\u0027s a soda machine. Now imagine that Bill in accounting voted against the soda machine.Comments (146)David PaulPresident, Fiscal Strategies GroupThe arrogant claims to fiscal rectitude of the Tea Party belie the underlying realities. They are not the makers of their own imagination, but are rather in large numbers the takers that they have been so quick to disdain.Comments (124)Tamara StarLife Coach, Speaker, WriterI\u0027m told happiness is a choice. Unfortunately we complicate our lives to the point of being unable to recognize happiness when it appears before our eyes.Comments (87)Victor StengerPhysicist, PhD, bestselling authorNo one can predict what practical applications can come out of the basic scientific research being done today, but history shows that without basic science we can expect little human progress.Comments (36)Elaine WeissNational coordinator, Broader Bolder Approach to EducationThe biggest difference between education scholar Diane Ravitch\u0027s new book, Reign of Error, and former DC Schools Chancellor Michelle Rhee\u0027s book, Radical, is that the first is based on extensive facts, the second heavily on fiction.Comments (37)Barbra StreisandSinger; Actress; Director; Composer; ActivistAs we now enter the third week of the unnecessary government shutdown, Americans should remember the words of GOP Representative Martin Stutzman, \"We\u0027re not going to be disrespected. We have to get something out of this. And I don\u0027t know what that even is.\"Comments (856)Steven Schlozman, M.D.Assistant Professor of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical SchoolDo they WANT this?

It\u0027s time to see girls for who they are: the driving force of their generation, one poised to bring real social change.CommentsGreg SchwemCorporate comedian, Business emcee, Author, \u0027Text Me If You\u0027re Breathing\u0027Up until now I have always been prone to measuring success in minutes.

If you like my hair, I will tell you it needs to be washed. If you tell me something good you see in me, I\u0027m the first to tell you something bad I see in me.
