{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonWhen we launched \"Opportunity: What Is Working\" last July, we envisioned the section as a place to spotlight the opportunities that do exist around job creation. Today, we add to HuffPost\u0027s family of sections dedicated to telling the stories of these opportunities, with a new section called \"What Is Working: Small Businesses.\" Sponsored by Goldman Sachs\u0027 10,000 Small Businesses initiative -- a $500 million investment supporting businesses in 11 cities -- the section will bring together a multitude of voices, starting conversations around small business from many angles: highlighting the role of community colleges, sharing tips from successful entrepreneurs, asking what the federal and local governments can do to support businesses, and inviting successful business owners to share tips and financial advice. In doing so, we hope to reflect the state of American small business and its vital role in the economy at large.CommentsTory BurchCEO and designer, Tory BurchWe\u0027ve realized that many of the women who participated in our mentorship programs needed something beyond advice and direction. They needed tools to help them develop their business and scale it.CommentsJohn PavleyCTO @ The Huffington Post, BloggerI felt bad for the Microsoft Store. The devices and accessories looked sharp and smart. But they were heavy to hold and didn\u0027t work as advertised.Comments (176)Susan PattonExecutive Coach, Human Resources Consultant, BloggerThe extreme reaction to my letter is astonishing. Honestly, it was intended as little more than honest advice from a Jewish mother.Comments (937)Dr. Andrew WeilFounder and director, The Arizona Center for Integrative MedicineHere are three widespread beliefs about healthy living that may seem to be based on common sense but that research has revealed to be either partially or entirely wrong.Comments (61)Brian Levin, J.D.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityWhile not well known outside of law enforcement and analysis circles until recently, the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas (ABT) has emerged as one of the most violent domestic extremist groups and crime syndicates in the nation.Comments (25)Michael HoganExecutive Arts and Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post Media GroupLucky Guy feels like a telegram from history because the newspapers it celebrates don\u0027t exist anymore. Gone are the days when a single columnist could steer the municipal conversation with shoe-leather reporting on police malfeasance.CommentsIra ChernusBlogger at MythicAmerica.usBarack Obama came to Israel and Palestine, saw what he wanted to see, and conquered the mainstream media with his eloquent words. U.S. and Israeli journalists called it a dream trip: a charismatic world leader taking charge of the Mideast peace process.Comments (58)Scott CaseCEO of the Startup America Partnership, Founding CTO of Priceline.comEven the largest corporations were once brand new startups. In order for the U.S. to remain competitive in a global market, Fortune 500s and startups need to engage in order to leverage the innovations and strategic assets that drive growth.CommentsMarty KaplanDirector, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolAt 6 a.m. last Friday, the FBI arrested Michael S. Steinberg, a 41-year-old stock trader for New York hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors, at his $8 million Manhattan co-op.Comments (48)David FontanaAssociate Professor of Law at George Washington University School of Law in Washington, D.C.The language that the Court used to talk about gay marriage this past week lacked the polarizing moral denunciations of homosexuality of the past. And the language the Court uses to debate national issues matters.Comments (214)Maxwell KennedyAuthor, attorney and environmentalistI was born a Democrat. My father was a Democrat as was his father and my great-grandfather, too. I guess I never really questioned the values of the Democratic Party when I was a child. But I am announcing today that I have become a Republican.CommentsChez PazienzaCo-host, \u0027The Bubble Genius Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027; writer, Deus Ex MalcontentI\u0027m past the point where the break-up of a band should provoke a reaction from me. I\u0027ve got day-to-day concerns that are a hell of a lot more pressing than whether a bunch of people whose music I happen to like will continue making music I happen to like. And yet My Chemical Romance was never just another band for me.CommentsDr. James HansenClimatologistHumanity\u0027s Faustian climate bargain is well known. Humans have been pumping both greenhouse gases (mainly CO2) and aerosols (fine particles) into the atmosphere for more than a century. Is the new data we present here good news or bad news, and how does it alter the \"Faustian bargain\"?Comments (256)Gordon BrownFormer Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationPakistan is today counting the costs of a week of carnage in which teachers and pupils have been violently attacked simply because they want to go to school. As pupils gathered at the Baldia Town School this morning for an awards ceremony, grenades were hurled into the building and then shots rang out.Comments (77)Blake Kernen7th grader from New Jersey, founder of peaceloveprofits.com, authorWhether my underwear is cute, colorful or funny, it\u0027s not going to make me more cute, colorful or funny. It\u0027s not my clothes, it\u0027s me. Victoria\u0027s Secret can try to tell to me that some new underwear will help make me more this or that, but I already have a pretty good idea of who I am.CommentsClaudia LonowTelevision writer; Producer; Bounty hunterSixteen years ago my 18-month-old daughter and I moved in with my parents. Suffice to say, this wasn\u0027t a high point in my life.CommentsSeth ShostakSenior Astronomer, SETI InstituteIt\u0027s a disturbing question, and one that I seem to get more frequently than before. \"Why are you looking for evidence of extraterrestrials? What\u0027s the point?\"Comments (28)Robert J. ElisbergScreenwriter and columnistMy mother, Betty Lou, loved April Fools\u0027 jokes. This may not seem like a big deal, except that she didn\u0027t really have a sense of humor. I don\u0027t mean that she wasn\u0027t funny or want to like jokes. Just that she didn\u0027t have a \"sense\" of them.CommentsDr. Judson BrewerAssistant Professor of Psychiatry, Yale School of MedicineI had a patient who had come in to my clinic to quit smoking. He was smoking 30 cigarettes a day and had tried to quit before but to no avail. On the first night of our smoking cessation class, I taught him a simple practice.CommentsRobert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The road to political and economic ruin for the Democrats began in the late spring of 2013, when President Obama agreed to a budget grand bargain that cut deficits by 2.8 trillion dollars over ten years, deflated a fragile recovery, and left no room for more than token domestic spending on jobs or infrastructure.Comments (271)Leo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersRepublicans never knew what their districts had gotten from the federal government. Until it was gone. Until after they\u0027d paved it over with the sequester. Now they\u0027re stalled in an economically barren parking lot of their own creation.Comments (339)Emma JohnsonWealthySingleMommy.comOver the past few years, I\u0027ve had interesting discussions around the question, \"Should you say \u0027I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 when someone reveals they\u0027re getting divorced?\"Comments (158)HuffPost Radiohigh feature.-DTIts \"Autopsy\" notwithstanding, Reagan \u0026 Frum discuss a possible \"Grand New Party\" on gay rights and guns post-Supreme Court and Newtown. Can GOP escape Evangelical and NRA stridency? Then: North Korea and North Dakota are both bluffing like crazy.CommentsCarole Brody FleetSpeaker and Award-Winning Author, \"Happily Even After…\" and \"Widows Wear Stilettos…\"One of the most common questions asked within both the widowed and divorced communities is, \u0027When is it appropriate to start dating again?\u0027 The quick answer is, \u0027Only you can make that determination.\u0027CommentsAbby BergmanJunior at Vistamar High School, activistI remember waking up the morning after Prop 8 passed wondering how this is possible and questioning why people didn\u0027t know better. How is it that a 17-year-old can see what some adults cannot seem to? That love makes a family.Comments (39)Scott ShambergSlightly cynical father of two, marketer, amateur comedian, Chicagoan.Do you, as a parent, get involved when a feed you\u0027re following through your child looks like a modern day Mean Girls? Instagram is today\u0027s digital diary with one big difference -- everyone CAN read it and you can\u0027t throw it away.CommentsMohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOA frail 94-year-old Nelson Mandela has again been admitted to hospital. On a prior occasion a year ago, I felt it important to write about this exceptional and unique man whose achievements should inspire many, and for a very long time. My already high respect for Mr. Mandela has only grown in the last year.Comments (36)HeartMath LLCProvides services to improve health and well-being while reducing stressHow does the heart relate to mindfulness? Mindfulness is about being present to what you\u0027re feeling, thinking and sensing. Connecting to our hearts enables us to be in \"the heart of the moment,\" and if you don\u0027t want to get hooked into those thoughts and feelings, you let them pass through.CommentsAdam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; founder of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911For a three-month period, every American will get a perfect credit score, and the federal government will guarantee all loans made as a result of this \"score stimulus.\"Comments (47)Michael RothPresident, Wesleyan UniversityConformity, whether rationalized or simply imposed, undermines our government, our press, and our educational systems. We\u0027ve had to learn some hard lessons about this in the last 10 years. Surely one of them is that we must defend diversity as a tool for innovation and for responsible decision-making.Comments (98)Rabbi Evan Moffic, 2013. 1.04Mary Ellen Harte, 2013. 1.04Maxwell Kennedy, 2013. 1.04Rebecca Juro, 2013. 1.04Chez Pazienza, 2013. 1.04Ian McMahan, 2013. 1.04Lisa Mirza Grotts, 2013. 1.04Kerri Zane, 2013. 1.04Kelly James Clark, 2013. 1.04Francis Levy, 2013. 1.04Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"EIGHT AGAINST EQUALITY",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
