{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupThe speech is, after all, called the State of the Union, not the State of the World. So perhaps President Barack Obama can be excused for dwelling on the American economy in his remarks Tuesday night, and all but ignoring the economic and political crises of the planet. There was lots of talk about how the U.S. has come back from the Great Recession, and about the president\u0027s plan (which the Republican-dominated Congress is likely to reject) to use new government programs and tax cuts to make up for the troubling stagnation of middle-class wages. But however assertive Obama was about the durability and creativity of the U.S. economy, he had little to say about global matters -- from economics to terrorism to the environment.With strong leaders from both the public and private sector, we can slow climate change now by putting a price on carbon, eliminating fuel subsidies, and bring together bold, innovative country plans.President, World Bank GroupThe \u0027care economy\u0027 allows people time to both make a living and do what they most care about.President and CEO, The New American FoundationThe billionaire class has views that are profoundly out of step with everyday Americans. And that goes a long way to explain the agenda of the new Congress.Independent U.S. Senator from VermontPresident, Public CitizenThe sports world is buzzing about allegations that the New England Patriots may have doctored footballs to gain an advantage in the AFC championship game.Anchor and reporterPresident Obama will end his years in office as the most liberal president since Nixon. But while the president frames the argument well, making this economy work for working people once more will take far bolder reforms. His years may mark the beginning of a new era of progressive reform, but only if people in motion force the argument.President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureStrange indeed, the story of Michel Houellebecq\u0027s latest novel, Soumission, which appeared just before the attack on Charlie Hebdo that left 12 people dead, like an advance echo of the terrible events that have plunged France into mourning, and scaring stiff not only the author\u0027s friends but Houellebecq himself.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.While these proposals are encouraging, and show some sign of progress, they are not nearly enough. Today, households headed by a female and women over 60 are the two poorest demographic groups in the United States.Bestselling Author, Find Your Voice: A Woman\u0027s Call to ActionWe began this week by celebrating the 85th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.\u0027s birth, but today the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments in an important case that could knock down a crucial racial and economic pillar of justice built during the civil rights movement.Director, ACLU National Office\u0027s Racial Justice ProgramIt\u0027s not even February and Fox News is already having a really bad year. If Obama\u0027s rebounding approval ratings didn\u0027t sting badly enough, Fox at the same time continues to wrestle with the unfolding crisis over its demonstrably false claim that some parts of Europe have become \"no-go zones\" for non-Muslims.Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaThe courageous women and men who are speaking out about their assaults should not have to share the most horrific experiences of their lives publicly in order to get the attention of their schools and their government. That shouldn\u0027t be on them.U.S. Senator from New YorkIt\u0027s not that we shouldn\u0027t talk about suicide because we\u0027re afraid it\u0027ll be contagious, but we need to know HOW to talk about it. We need to be sensitive to our audience. We need to be considerate of other people\u0027s experiences. We need to be kind and understanding.Mental health advocate, reader, writer, tweeter and the resident tall girlAs Majority Leader McConnell wields greater power than he has ever held in his life, some hack pundits predict that such awesome power will have a moderating influence on him. Don\u0027t count on it. People who strive for power the way McConnell has done throughout his career cannot be trusted to \"moderate\" themselves.Professor, historian, authorWhile the President didn\u0027t mention Keystone XL by name in his State of the Union, the speech only solidified the feeling that the pipeline is doomed.Co-founder and Communications Director, 350.orgJanuary 22 marks 42 years since Roe v. Wade legalized abortion nationwide, but our fight to make sure all women have access to safe, legal abortion is far from over. Politicians won\u0027t hesitate to take away the right to make personal, complex decisions about reproductive health. We must stop taking our hard-won rights for granted.President and CEO, Planned Parenthood of New York CityTonight, the president rallied the nation to challenge an economic system that has ill-served regular Americans for far too long. Senator Warren, and the grassroots movement she has so inspired, helped make that possible, by showing that at this time in American history, such a battle cry would could take wing. Tonight was their triumph, too.Washington Director, MoveOn.org; host, The Good FightThe president last night had the gall to state not just victory in our wars, but to take credit for the great and loving care American veterans are receiving.Senior Fellow, Center for International Policy; MatthewHoh.comWhat Obama is proposing puts the GOP in a bit of a pickle. They\u0027re going to have to explain why they think giving working Americans tax breaks, more money in their pockets, and a hand up is a bad idea and why they would prefer to use public money to support billionaires.Richard Zombeck is a freelance writer for hire at www.zombeckink.com and contributes to www.nowitcounts.comHer tactics are always the same: mixing obvious statements with half-truths, and sometimes outright lies under the guise of common sense, finding all French political leaders but her guilty of incompetence and hypocrisy.Spokesperson for the French Socialist Party and former member of the National Assembly of FranceMany psychologists and psychiatrists are justifiably horrified at the central role members of their own profession have played in these torture experiments. Unfortunately, our biomedical profession has a long history of experimentation on humans.Neurologist, public health specialist, authorNew evidence about addiction isn\u0027t just a challenge to us politically. It doesn\u0027t just force us to change our minds. It forces us to change our hearts.Author of \u0027Chasing The Scream: The First and Last Days of the War on Drugs\u0027Now is the time for the President to show the courage of his convictions by taking executive action to ensure that U.S. assistance will be available for abortion access for women who survive rape or incest, or whose lives are endangered by a pregnancy. It is the right thing to do. The time to act is now.President, Center for Health and Gender EquityLast night in the State of the Union Address, President Obama laid out an agenda to protect and grow America\u0027s middle class.
