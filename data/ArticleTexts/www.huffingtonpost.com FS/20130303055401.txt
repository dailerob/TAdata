{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Children\u0027s Defense FundToday, too many would-be movement leaders simply want to be Dr. King or Mrs. Rosa Parks: they want the glory and privilege of leadership without the burdens or sacrifice and sustained hard work. Movements are not built from the top down by powerful leaders but percolate from the bottom up from people who share common grievances. Nor are they the result of individuals acting alone, although the courageous actions of one individual can provide a powerful defining symbolic spark -- just as with the image of the dignified and proud Mrs. Parks sitting on that bus and refusing to move. Their individual and collective decisions to stand up for themselves and one another created the Montgomery movement -- and the Montgomery movement changed America’s conception of what was just and possible.Read Post | Comments (35)Tom Zeller Jr., 03/02/13Senior Writer, The Huffington PostDire warnings that our localized environmental impacts could trigger global-scale \"tipping points\" and permanently break the planet have no scientific basis, authors of a new paper argue. Not everyone agrees.Read Post | Comments (674)Jamie Lee Curtis, 03/01/13Actress and children\u0027s book authorI was offended last week. As an Academy member, as the child of former Academy members and as a woman, I expected more from the best that the movie business has to offer. The Oscars are about honoring art and artists. It is not supposed to be a cheesy vaudeville show.Read Post | Comments (795)Bob Cesca, 03/01/13Political Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowThere are two sides to the deficit idiocy. Firstly, the completely inexcusable conflation of the deficit and the debt, and, secondly, the total failure to acknowledge actual deficit reduction. As a result, deficit hysteria is based on nearly unprecedented stupidity and deliberate deception.Read Post | Comments (995)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 03/02/13Author, research psychologist and gender scholarWhatever the situation and justification, lying among parents is, it seems, the norm. The most common: \"If you don\u0027t come with me now, I will leave you here by yourself,\" followed by false promises for a toy or other reward in exchange for compliance.Read Post | Comments (16)Marlo Thomas, 03/01/13Award-winning actress, author and activistLast Monday was terrible. The phone began ringing before 9 a.m., I had back-to-back (to-back) meetings well into the afternoon, and by the time happy hour arrived, I was not happy at all. My back hurt and my head was spinning. I was, what my mom used to call, \"cranky.\" Then a friend sent me an email.Read Post | Comments (36)Robert Reich, 03/01/13Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The President should let the public see the Tea Partiers for who they are -- a small, radical minority intent on dismantling the government of the United States. As long as they are allowed to dictate the terms of public debate they will continue to hold the rest of us hostage to their extremism.Read Post | Comments (2,349)Arianna Huffington, 03/01/13In this week\u0027s issue, Jaweed Kaleem writes about the resurgence of home funerals, a tradition with deep roots in American life. And Ryan Reilly checks in on one of President Obama\u0027s original campaign promises: to close the Guantanamo Bay naval base and detention center in Cuba.Read Post | Comments (17)David Katz, M.D., 03/02/13Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterI have great respect and appreciation for the Times, and a fair portion of both for the insights of foodie/journalist Mark Bittman. But I have just about none of either for the combination of the two represented in an editorial by Mr. Bittman in the Times this week declaring sugar toxic.Read Post | CommentsNatalia Brzezinski, 03/02/13writer, mother, wife of U.S. Ambassador to Sweden, women\u0027s empowerment activistEmpowering women in business and leadership is critical to growth and prosperity. As one of Sweden\u0027s most powerful women, Annika Falkengren was the ideal person to ask: What are the elements necessary to create an ideal ecosystem for female leadership?Read Post | CommentsSugata Mitra, 02/27/132013 TED Prize winnerWe need a curriculum of big questions, examinations where children can talk, share and use the Internet, and new, peer assessment systems. In the networked age, we need schools, not structured like factories, but like clouds. Join us up there.Read Post | Comments (1,006)James Zogby, 03/02/13President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Chuck Hagel is a valued friend. As a result, it was profoundly disturbing to me and members of my community when some of his opponents attempted to make his appearances before Arab Americans an issue in his confirmation process.Read Post | CommentsJohn M. Eger, 03/02/13Van Deerlin Endowed Chair of Communications and Public Policy and Director of the Creative Economy Initiative, San Diego State UniversityThe challenge today is not acquiring information, or memorizing it. Rather, it is determining which information is relevant. What do our young people need to know and why, in this new, global, technology-driven world?Read Post | CommentsKeli Goff, 03/01/13Author and political correspondent, TheRoot.comIt\u0027s too simplistic to say that women are just jealous of them. It\u0027s more complex than that. Their lives seem to be working for them in a way that the lives of very few women, or people in general, are working.Read Post | Comments (219)Miriam Sherin, 03/02/13Professor of Education and Social Policy, Northwestern UniversityAn innovator in many ways -- from his use of text to the illustrations he created -- Dr. Seuss opened up new worlds for children and adults. While his primary contributions may very well be in the world of reading, his books offer important lessons for mathematics learning as well.Read Post | CommentsJulia Li, 03/02/13Founder, HCD GlobalWho should be responsible for this part of education? Ideally this should be the parent\u0027s responsibility. The question is: Who is giving parents that knowledge?Read Post | CommentsIsabella Huffington, 03/01/13Junior at Yale majoring in Art HistoryGetting my period meant I was healthy. And that was the problem. I didn\u0027t want to be healthy; I wanted to be skinny. And I wanted to be skinny more than I wanted to be anything else. When I was 11, a friend asked me what superpower I wanted. I told her I wanted to be invisible.Read Post | Comments (43)Tile Wolfe, 03/02/13LGBT activistLast week, Amazon launched a new ad for their Kindle Paperwhite and proved \"equality marketing\" is very, very real. And it worked. The LGBT blogs loved it, individual allies were promising all over social media to snap up a Kindle just to promote inclusivity.Read Post | Comments (19)Les Leopold, 03/01/13Author, \"How to Make a Million Dollars an Hour\" (Wiley 2013)We need to reframe the debate yet again. Wall Street should pay for the damage it created. They owe us. That money should be used to put Americans back to work by rebuilding our infrastructure, insulating our homes and businesses, and by paying tuition for Americans who want and need higher education.Read Post | Comments (356)The Stir, 03/02/13CafeMom blogFinding out your husband of a zillion years doesn\u0027t want you anymore is like the world\u0027s biggest failed job interview.Read Post | Comments (29)Tracy Morrison, 03/01/13Blogger, Writer, MomEsther is seven. Yet her seven is nothing like her sister\u0027s seven two short years ago. While I\u0027ve now enjoyed nearly 730 days of \"sevens\" in my house, there\u0027s no stereotype I can share with you that perfectly captures this magical age. It turns out that seven can be complicated.Read Post | Comments (11)Raymond J. Learsy, 03/02/13Author, \u0027Oil and Finance: The Epic Corruption Continues\u0027The \"arbitrary and dumb\" budget cuts brought about by the sequester is a shameful exercise of government mismanagement most especially and precariously in these difficult economic times.Read Post | Comments (22)Theo Randall, 03/01/13Chef, restaurant ownerThis is a really easy way to make a delicious pasta dish.

One thing they do seem to agree on, though, is that they aren\u0027t willing to close corporate tax loopholes to avoid it.Read Post | Comments (172)Dr. Idit Harel Caperton, 03/02/13Israeli-American entrepreneur; Founder, World Wide WorkshopWhat Mitra is planning is both needed in our world and is a departure from anything that has ever been done before in education reform on a large scale. Moreover, if his TED Wish is not anti-establishment, it is certainly outside the typical range of ed-tech innovation.Read Post | CommentsJessie Woolley-Wilson, 03/01/13Chair, President and CEO, DreamBox LearningHow do you measure individual learning progression when students are exclusively engaged in collective learning?

The technology we\u0027ve created gives us a plethora of new possibilities. But the technology we\u0027ve created also takes something away from us: being present, focused, and in the moment.Read Post | CommentsSteve McSwain, 02/28/13Author, Speaker, Thought Leader, Spiritual TeacherThere is one thing I think all Christians should remember, and that is the one simple thing Jesus once said would be the one-and-only thing the world would know us by: \"They will know you are my disciples by your love\" (John 13:35).
