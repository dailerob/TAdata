For example, we have Little League teams, Fourth of July neighborhood parades and our own weird kind of hot dog called a \"half smoke.\" But the most convincing evidence of our Americanness is that we cherish a beat-up old bar called The Tune Inn, only three blocks from the Capitol on Pennsylvania Ave. And if you are a political junkie and follow the news in Washington you know that the Beltway world came to a screeching halt Wednesday morning when news broke that there was a fire at there.Read Post | CommentsJim Wallis, 06.22.2011Christian leader for social changeWe recognize that legitimate ethical and moral issues are at stake in Afghanistan, but we humbly believe there is a better way than war to address these important issues.Read Post | CommentsKathleen Reardon, 06.22.2011Professor, USC Marshall School; Author, \u0027The Secret Handshake and Comebacks At Work\u0027Critical argument in the U.S. media is no longer about seeking truth to correct or sustain our formative values; rather it is about winning so that others might lose. How do we find a way back?Read Post | CommentsCaryl Rivers, 06.22.2011Professor of Journalism at Boston UniversityWomen are acutely aware of a deep unease among men of the combination of female sexuality and power that stretches far back into history.

It\u0027s an all-out assault on the future of the young.Read Post | CommentsDr. Peggy Drexler, 06.22.2011Author, \u0027Our Fathers Ourselves. Daughters, Fathers, And The Changing American Family\u0027As daughters make more room for fathers in their lives, does that mean less room for mothers? Love is all embracing. But in the lives of young girls, emotional attention span is often limited. You can only roll your eyes at one parent at a time.Read Post | CommentsRhoda P. Curtis, 06.22.2011Author, \"Rhoda: Her First Ninety Years,\" \"After Ninety: What\"I have been thinking about what it means to \"age gracefully\" and I wonder whose opinion seems to matter.

And we\u0027re currently nowhere near it.Read Post | CommentsEvelyn Leopold, 06.22.2011Veteran reporter at the United NationsSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon\u0027s re-election process is complete. The question is whether he is good at his job and most agree he is, despite a low-profile that can work to his disadvantage.Read Post | CommentsJamie Court, 06.22.2011Author,The Progressive\u0027s Guide To Raising Hell/President Consumer WatchdogIt\u0027s ironic that a company whose mission is to open information to the world would dodge an opportunity for openness and transparency on its own doings with the American people and their Congress.Read Post | CommentsRobert Scheer, 06.22.2011Editor of Truthdig.com, Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027Bill Clinton\u0027s Newsweek cover story shows that the man has long been convinced that there is no problem or contradiction of his that cannot be simply plastered over with blather.
