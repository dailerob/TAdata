{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor of sociology, University of California at BerkeleyFaced with the specter of a Trump presidency, calls for Democrats to \"unify the party\" are reaching a crescendo. Now that Hillary Clinton has won a clear majority of pledged delegates as well as 55 percent of the popular vote and been declared the presumptive nominee, calls for Bernie Sanders to drop out of the race have an undeniable logic. Under normal circumstances, this would -- and should -- be the end of the matter, for Secretary Clinton won a primary process in which over 25 million people participated, and elementary respect for democratic norms would make her the nominee. But this is anything but a normal election, and it would be a mistake at this point -- for the Democratic Party and for the country -- for Senator Sanders to withdraw.Please forgive me for not writing sooner, Mexico.

Weeks ago, we were told that women needed to be protected. But apparently not from rapists.Writer, speaker, musician, and defender of Oxford comma. Author of \u0027Embracing Grief\u0027Thank you for reawakening a wave of excitement within the Democratic Party. Thank you for championing a list of issues that I could heartily agree with, and for refusing to be distracted from your agenda by the usual mudslinging and other negative campaigning tactics so common in politics today.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comWhile I am certainly excited that there are a growing number of individual organizations committed to building communities of environmental action, it\u0027s also important to recognize that we can\u0027t create change in isolation.

Imagine my surprise when Kevin said that the evidence supported the murderer\u0027s account.Media funded and run by women.As encouraging as it is to see Clinton start to embrace \"the vision thing,\" big questions remain. One is whether she will revert back to attacks on Trump and laundry lists of policies.Senior Fellow, Roosevelt Institute and Director of Our Story - The Hub for American Narratives.Full of vibrant, exciting life and natural beauty, the seas are also vast economic engines and a source of nourishment for our own future generations.
