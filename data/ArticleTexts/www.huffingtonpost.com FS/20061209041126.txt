{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"APAPFrom deadlinehollywooddaily.comThe big story this week was, of course, the release of the Iraq Study Group report -- and President Bush\u0027s less than warm reception of it (Hey, at least I read the damn thing, what more do you want?). The report was more fruit salad than silver bullet, but it did provide the Bush administration with the chance to come up with yet another Iraq war slogan. \"I believe we need a new approach,\" said the president. A New Approach. Add that to the lengthening slogan timeline that started with A Gathering Threat, strutted through Slam Dunk, Shock and Awe, and Mission Accomplished, then hung tough with Last Throes, Adapt to Win, and Stay the Course.
