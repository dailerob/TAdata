{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week began with all sorts of madness. College hoops\u0027 March Madness began on Thursday, and if I had a bracket it would no doubt already be busted. Weather madness broke out on Friday, the first day of spring, with a snowstorm on the East Coast. More serious meteorological madness descended as Senator Mitch McConnell launched a national effort to thwart new EPA regulations on coal-fired carbon emissions. This comes as new data showed that the rate of melting on Antarctica\u0027s East Ice could lead to a world sea-level rise of at least 11 feet and that -- spring snowstorms aside -- 2014 was the warmest year on record. On Friday, HuffPost\u0027s Sam Stein interviewed President Obama, who, when asked about managing stress, said he takes \"the long view.\" It\u0027s a perspective we\u0027ll need -- combined with short-term political urgency -- if we\u0027re going to tackle climate change. To do otherwise is true madness.American foreign policy is controlled by fools. What else can one conclude from the bipartisan demand that the U.S. intervene everywhere all the time, irrespective of consequences?Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteAn Oscar for \"Still Alice\" is shining the brightest light yet on Alzheimer\u0027s, but light isn\u0027t enough anymore. Attention isn\u0027t enough. It\u0027s time to get serious. Alzheimer\u0027s is exerting a powerful impact on American families -- on our health, our finances, and our futures. And women are disproportionately impacted.Award-winning journalist, bestselling author and activistHow does the brain change as we age, and what steps can we take to help our brains stay healthy as time goes by? In answer to my questions, Claire Sexton, a post-doctoral research assistant at the Oxford Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain, elaborated on some of her latest scientific findings and offered some tips on how to improve the quality of our sleep.The college admissions mania that gets worse and worse every year is a mirror of America: anxious and stratified.Author, \u0027Where You Go Is Not Who You’ll Be: An Antidote to the College Admissions Mania\u0027I\u0027m sure most of us can\u0027t imagine being uprooted from our homes and forced to flee with only the clothes on our backs. But that\u0027s what millions of people face each day. As Syria enters its 5th year of conflict, 3.9 million people have fled Syria to neighboring countries.Co-host, MSNBC’s \u0027Morning Joe\u0027A mass abduction that was seen a year ago as unprecedented -- sparking justifiable outrage across the world -- now seems, after a series of further kidnaps, to look like a sadly increasingly familiar tactic in the terrorist arsenal.Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationLet me be free. Let me be me! Don\u0027t make me old, with your thinking and words about how I should be.ArtistWhat about other sources of revenue? Establishing an honest notary service, cashing most checks, selling fishing and hunting licenses, wrapping holiday gifts, and accepting wine or beer for delivery are just a few congressionally prohibited proposals that have been put forward by postal activists and watchdogs.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorI have concluded that the productive discussion I envisioned cannot occur in the shadow of active litigation and the resulting present intense polarity. For these reasons, I will not lecture at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in the spring of 2015.Senior Advisor to the Provost at Brandeis University, Professor of LawI\u0027m frequently asked the loaded question of how much I am madly in love with Walter. I mostly give the questioner what they want with a nod of assent. But the truth of my emotion is more complicated. I think maybe the problem is with how I have, up to this point, understood the word \"love.\"Executive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostLet\u0027s get real, as the kids say. If Israel fails to get Washington to go to war with Iran, it will have lost a very big bet. More fantasizing will not get it out of that hole. Some Israelis of high rank recognize that; too many of their American sympathizers do not.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghCongress must stop playing politics with children and pass four more years of funding for CHIP and MIECHV as part of the \"doc fix\" package if millions of children are not to be left with uncertainty and at greater risk. We need to ensure our children are healthy, supported, and strong if they are going to be able to support our growing number of seniors in the future.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundIn the lead up to Israel\u0027s March 17th election, Prime Minister Benjamin (Bibi) Netanyahu, fearful that he might lose his reelection bid, threw caution to the wind making blatant appeals to scare voters into returning him to office.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027For now, Ferguson has become the symbol and brand of the challenges we face in a multi-racial society. Perhaps this once sleepy little town has been waiting for this moment all along. Perhaps the country needs to reach deep into the heartland to get its heart right again.JournalistPart of the reason why opponents to a nuclear deal with Iran are so bewildered by President Barack Obama\u0027s diplomacy is because their belief that Iran can be forced to capitulate. They adhere to a George W. Bush administration-era argument: If the U.S. only were to ramp up pressure, it can dictate the terms of the deal instead of having to agree to a compromise. Nothing could be further from the truth.Research Director, National Iranian American CouncilPresident, National Iranian American CouncilWhile Obama has slowly stepped up transferring detainees already cleared by a multi-agency process for release from Guantanamo to other countries, his administration has dragged its feet on reviewing the 51 detainees who aren\u0027t yet cleared, out of the remaining 122.Senior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstFor the first time in 40 years, global carbon dioxide emissions from the energy sector did not increase. During 2014, the global economy grew by 3 percent but emissions remained at 2013 levels.Executive Director, Greenpeace InternationalYou know that irresistible urge to compliment someone who lost weight? Well, before doing so, know this: Your comments are welcome, but please, for the sanity of all former overweight folks, don\u0027t dip your toe in tactless waters.Writer, photographer and weight loss success story who prefers to see the glass half full.The economy toward which we\u0027re hurtling -- in which more and more is generated by fewer and fewer people who reap almost all the rewards, leaving the rest of us without enough purchasing power -- can\u0027t function.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Two years ago, in March, my younger brother died, quite unexpectedly. He\u0027d been my only sibling and, both of our parents being gone, the only other person in my original family. His daughter had asked my daughter to tell me the news.Professor Emerita, Women and Gender Studies at U.C. DavisSTOCKHOLM - A breakthrough might compel a phase of intense diplomacy, giving Iran a pathway to diplomatic normalization and opening the door for grand bargains that could begin to restore order and stability to the rest of the region. A breakdown, by contrast, though unlikely to lead immediately to war, could easily foment developments that lead in that direction, and the region as a whole could be pulled even deeper into the current vortex of chaos and violence.Sweden’s foreign minister from 2006 to October 2014, and was Prime Minister from 1991 to 1994There can be no real peace with honor if women are left out. Without women at the table, women\u0027s rights will be an empty promise if peace is ever negotiated.Money Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsEating wild seafood can contribute to solving one of our most pressing problems, the fact that one billion people wake up hungry every day. Even so, what does fine dining have to do with solving world hunger?Actor; board member, OceanaCEO, OceanaLoretta Lynch deserves a vote and so do all the Federal Prosecutors who work for the Attorney General and so do the American people.Host, Fox News\u0027 \u0027On the Record With Greta Van Susteren\u0027AMMAN -- The Israeli electorate had a choice to make. By reelecting a leader who publicly reneged on his commitments to peace and a two-state solution, they voted against peace.Palestinian journalistThe BDSP is based on a bedrock belief in how America should work: that the only strength that really matters is military and that a great country is one with the capacity to beat the bejesus out of everyone else.Author of \u0027War Is Not a Game: The New Antiwar Soldiers and the Movement They Built\u0027While all water conservation is good, not all water conservation is equal. If you make a few smarter choices, you really shouldn\u0027t feel guilty about the things listed below -- provided you don\u0027t over-indulge.JournalistHow often do I have to raise my voice to be taken seriously? How acutely attuned are we to the way a man looks at the hem of our dress or the cut of our neckline?Senior Editor, HuffPost LAIt\u0027s an open secret that the Pentagon has routinely been using the war budget -- known as the Overseas Contingency Operations account -- as a slush fund to pay for items that don\u0027t fit within the caps on its base budget. If a new report is accurate, the House Budget Committee will propose an increase of over $40 billion in the OCO account, bringing the total to an astounding $90 billion.Director, Arms and Security Project, Center for International PolicyWhen you are struggling with depression, it is so tempting to think that this is the way it will always be. But life takes different twists and turns, and we don\u0027t get to know what the next chapter in our life will bring if we give up on ourselves.Marriage and Family TherapistGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"OBAMA TAKES ON BIBI",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
