{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOBill Clinton let it be known beforehand that he wasn\u0027t happy making his speech on national security night -- preferring to talk about the economy and, hence, his legacy. You could tell. National security rated only passing mentions -- broad generalities when specifics were called for. This despite the fact that the Bush years have given us so many tragic specifics to remind the American people of. In contrast, Biden repeatedly, effectively, and with great detail made the case that on the key national security issues of our time -- including Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, and Pakistan -- \"McCain was wrong and Obama was right.\" It was a powerful indictment -- and effectively made the case that national security is actually John McCain\u0027s weakness.Read Post | CommentsBIORJ Eskow, 08.27.2008Bill went much further than Hillary did in praising Obama, and it made all the past rumors of bruised Clinton/Obama egos feel like nothing more than a dramatic build-up to a satisfying denouement.Read Post | Comments (27)BIOHarry Shearer, 08.27.2008\"Katrina and cronyism.\" That\u0027s the sum total of the verbiage from the podium of the DNC about the \"greatest man-made engineering disaster in American history.\"Read Post | Comments (33)BIOSeth Colter Walls, 08.27.2008If we\u0027re going to have Obama-centric coverage, it\u0027s better for Democrats to have his loose, affable matter instead of leaving all the definition of Obama to the McCain campaign oppo team.Read Post | Comments (22)Rachel Sklar, 08.27.2008Brand Clinton was at stake here, and Hill and Bill delivered the one-two Clinton punch that proved that their claim on the hearts and minds of the Democratic party was not entirely misplaced.Read Post | Comments (17)BIONora Ephron, 08.27.2008The Clintons\u0027 narcissism perfumed every bit of Hillary\u0027s campaign, and it leaked down to her contributors and followers. \"Were you in it for me?\" was the funniest line of her speech.Read Post | Comments (965)BIOJack Hidary, 08.27.2008The tradition of sequestering the nominee like some wedding-eve bride is a quaint one and equally as fun to abrogate with a surprise appearance.Read Post | CommentsAri Emanuel, 08.27.2008Let\u0027s talk about Obama\u0027s energy policy and if it is the right step. Let\u0027s talk about the Iraq war and the war in Afghanistan and which candidate\u0027s choices demonstrated a greater quality of experience.Read Post | Comments (21)BIOJoe Cirincione, 08.27.2008If George Bush had listened to Joe Biden instead of Donald Rumsfeld, the history of the past seven years would have been very different. We might have prevented 9/11.Read Post | Comments (22)BIOBill Curry, 08.27.2008For talking woman to woman there\u0027s no one like Hillary. When it\u0027s time to talk Bubbah to Bubbah, there\u0027s nobody like Bill. Between them they can talk to the Democrats\u0027 two problem demographics like nobody else.Read Post | CommentsBIOBill Maher, 08.27.2008Read Post | Comments (53)BIOGeoffrey R. Stone, 08.27.2008The current makeup of the Supreme Court renders it the most conservative group of justices in living memory. Should this matter to the supporters of Hillary Clinton? You bet it should.Read Post | Comments (49)BIOHilary Rosen, 08.27.2008Hillary did everything she needed to achieve for a united party and a dignified conclusion to her campaign for her supporters. I think she gave the speech of her life.Read Post | Comments (32)Stephen Kaus, 08.27.2008Steven Weber, 08.27.2008Mona Gable, 08.27.2008Michael Shaw, 08.27.2008Ken Adelman, 08.27.2008Kathleen Reardon, 08.27.2008Ira Forman, 08.27.2008Robert Kuttner, 08.27.2008Julian E.
