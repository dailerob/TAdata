{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week showed how celebration can often go hand-in-hand with desolation. In Bangladesh, a woman was rescued from the rubble of the collapsed garment factory, having been buried alive for 17 days -- even as the death toll passed 1,000. In Cleveland, Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight were freed after years in captivity, touching off celebrations that were tempered by revelations of the horror of their prolonged abuse. With the raising of its spire, 1 World Trade Center became the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere, nearly a dozen years after the devastating losses of 9/11. And though a lowered deficit is good news, any celebration should be tempered by the fact that fiscal belt-tightening has come with a high price: disastrous unemployment rates. As the New York Times put it: \"Consensus about the result is clear: Immediate deficit reduction is a drag on full economic recovery.\" Consensus, that is, everywhere but in Washington.Comments (36)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistOur house was always ?lled with music -- from the moment we woke up. And whenever she threw a dinner party, you could be sure that at some point, Nat Cole or Sammy Cahn would be at the piano, accompanying Frank Sinatra or Sammy Davis or Sophie Tucker.Comments (33)Christy Turlington BurnsFounder, Every Mother Counts, Director/Producer, NO WOMAN, NO CRY, global maternal health advocate, mom, modelSince our inception, Mother\u0027s Day has been our biggest attention-grabbing, awareness-building opportunity to rally the troops and engage new audiences to join our efforts to make pregnancy and childbirth safe for all moms.Comments (18)Arianna Huffington\"I have experienced failure as a politician,\" Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe once said. In his second round as the country\u0027s prime minister, he is determined to avoid the mistakes of the past -- beginning with how to deal with the stagnant Japanese economy.Comments (431)Diane LaneActressNeedless suffering and death can be avoided if women are invested in and valued culturally for more than just their reproductive capacity.CommentsJamie Lee CurtisActress and children\u0027s book authorPlease keep your distance and encourage your viewers and readers to keep theirs. Please let them speak only if and when they want to. Please focus on the joy and not the horror.Comments (188)Jackie Barden, Nicole Hockley, Nelba Marquez-Greene and Francine WheelerAs \"Sandy Hook Moms,\" we often hear the phrase \"I can\u0027t imagine what you are going through.\" Well, please imagine it. Imagine what it\u0027s like to lose a son or daughter to gun violence and encourage your elected officials to do the same.Comments (3,957)Daniel Arrigg Koh and Margaret Wheeler JohnsonBy using my middle name, I ensure that in small ways -- my e-mail signature, the way I sign credit card receipts -- and large -- the way my name appears one day on my wedding invitation, my mom is and will always be on shining display as a fundamental part of me.CommentsJoan LundenAuthor, TV personalityAs both a caregiver to my 94-year old mom, Gladyce, and a mother of seven, Mother\u0027s Day is a holiday that I cherish with my family. It\u0027s a time to reflect on the lessons we\u0027ve learned from mom, and the way those teachings have shaped who we are and how we instill values in our own families.Comments (19)Cate EdwardsFounding Partner, Edwards and Eubanks, LLC and President, Elizabeth Edwards FoundationEvery person has a timeline of their own life, made up of the big moments in it -- the personal bests and worsts that singe their memories. On my timeline, one of those worsts came on November 3, 2004, when my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer.Comments (12)Alec BaldwinActorI have not acted in a legit show on Broadway since A Streetcar Named Desire in 1992, having chosen the not-for-profit route on Broadway or regional for my last four shows. Broadway has changed in the past 21 years and I wanted take a moment to look at that.Comments (184)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe \"Faces of Courage\" campaign is focused on honoring gun violence victims and their families -- and taking action so fewer mothers who are celebrating Mother\u0027s Day this weekend will be mourning their own children next year and in years to come.Comments (470)Mika BrzezinskiCo-host of MSNBC’s \"Morning Joe\"This is the book I have been afraid to write . . . terrified actually. It deals with an issue that is radioactive for me. How I eat, diet, and look has tied me up in knots my entire life, and I know I am not alone.Comments (145)Arianna HuffingtonSunday is Mother\u0027s Day, one of the year\u0027s high points of gratitude. So as we honor the mothers among us (and those no longer among us), there\u0027s no better time to tap into that gratitude and draw on the qualities that make mothers such a force for good -- their generosity, their nurturing, their unconditional love. We\u0027re doing that with two initiatives, the Global Mom Relay and Mom Social, both harnessing the power of motherhood and social media to improve the lives of mothers and children around the world. In the course of the Relay, we\u0027ve heard a range of voices, and each time you share a post, a $5 donation is made by Johnson \u0026 Johnson and the Bill \u0026 Melinda Gates Foundation. And there\u0027s still time to join.Comments (64)Al GoreChairman, Generation Investment Management and The Climate Reality ProjectYesterday, for the first time in human history, concentrations of carbon dioxide, the primary global warming pollutant, hit 400 parts per million in our planet\u0027s atmosphere. Now, more than ever before, we are reaping the consequences of our recklessness.Comments (1,160)Shannyn MooreJust a girl from Homer, AlaskaOur country\u0027s founding principles of habeus corpus were in a direct response to the \"lock them away in the Tower\" abuses in Britain. We were going to be different. Oh, I know Guantanamo isn\u0027t on American soil, but our flag flies over that prison -- the same one we pledge \"liberty and justice for all\" to.Comments (29)Ann CurryNBC News National and International CorrespondentAs a journalist, I\u0027ve had the opportunity to meet with mothers around the world who are facing tough challenges in war zones and remote areas without access to medical care for themselves and their children. This is unacceptable.Comments (12)Annise ParkerMayor of Houston, TXThough Kathy and I have been building a life together for 22 years, we cannot marry in our home state -- the state where I was born, and where I serve in Houston\u0027s highest office. Texas, like 40 other states, does not allow same-sex couples to marry.Comments (112)Muhammad YunusNobel Peace Prize winner and founder of Grameen BankBoth the national and the international businesses should feel as though the workers are a part of their family. The days of slave labor have to come to an end. It is better to start the process now, before more ugly incidents occur.Comments (46)Mark Hyman, MDPracticing physicianToday, I want to celebrate my mother because she taught me something so essential and enduring that it has become my greatest passion: cooking. The closer we can get to the food we eat, the shorter the link between field and fork, the better off we will all be.CommentsSuze OrmanHost, \"The Suze Orman Show\"There are no money problems. There are people problems. Success is not how many zeroes your bank account has. It\u0027s about making the most of the life you have.Comments (126)Tavis SmileyPBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorCommentsEva LongoriaActress, Founder of the Eva Longoria FoundationAre maids a realistic reflection of Latinas in America today?? Yes, but they are not a reflection of every Latina. Stereotypes are constructed and perpetuated by those who believe in them. I choose not to.Comments (156)George LucasFilmmaker and Founder of the George Lucas Educational FoundationFrom kindergarten to college, certain teachers engaged my curiosity and motivated me to learn. While I was not the best student, their efforts left a lasting impact.Comments (34)Susan Blumenthal, M.D.Public Health Editor, The Huffington Post; Former U.S. Assistant Surgeon GeneralMother\u0027s Day is a celebration of life and reflects the importance of women to their families, communities and countries. However, worldwide HIV/AIDS robs women and girls of their potential and health.CommentsJessica AshleyWriter at SassafrassI have officially held the title of single parent for twice the amount of time I was a married mom. It has not been easy. Or simple. Or all bliss. But I love the family I\u0027ve made, the home we\u0027ve created and the kind of mother I am always becoming.Comments (26)Robert F. Kennedy Jr.President, Waterkeeper Alliance; Senior Attorney, NRDCWith cash gushers of oily money cascading down their open gullets, the Republican leadership\u0027s mercenary devotion to Big Oil shouldn\u0027t shock us. However, the boldness of the party\u0027s most recent assault on the public interest might cause us to ponder how GOP\u0027s honchos\u0027 knee jerk slavishness to petroleum interest has infected its rank and file.Comments (483)Ambassador Eric Goosby, MDU.S. Global AIDS CoordinatorWhether a woman is a mother today, or a mother to be, her health is paramount -- both for her own productivity and quality of life, and that of the next generation. One way that we can help to support women -- and their children -- is by ensuring that all mothers receive the essential health services they need, including for HIV.CommentsValerie JarrettSenior Advisor and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsAs the girls described the atrocities they had suffered -- in many cases, for years -- my blood boiled. How on earth could this happen time and time again, right here in our community? How could the internet be used so blatantly as a tool to sell our children into slavery?Comments (64)Seema JilaniPhysician reporting from AfghanistanI don\u0027t need you to \"tolerate\" me. I don\u0027t want you to merely put up with my presence. All I ask, all I have ever asked, is to be treated as a human being, that bigoted jingoism is not injected into every minute facet my life, that there remains at least the illusion of decency.Comments (2,516)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarSo much of the advice geared towards women who choose to go back to work, focuses on how they can learn to accept the sacrifices that go along with working while raising children. I\u0027d argue that in many cases, going back to work is not a sacrifice at all but the best decision a woman can make not only for herself, but also for her family.Comments (156)Terrie M.
