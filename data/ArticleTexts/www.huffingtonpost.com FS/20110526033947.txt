{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Host of MSNBC\u0027s “The Dylan Ratigan Show”What last week\u0027s attacks on Cornel West\u0027s character showed is that Obama\u0027s supporters do not want to acknowledge that they may be \"Hooked on Hope\" instead of \"Eager for Evidence.\" It is far easier to believe that Cornel West is some egomaniac upset that he didn\u0027t get tickets to a party, than to acknowledge our own disempowerment. Very few of West\u0027s critics focused on his policy critiques, how he pointed out that Obama continued imperialist policies and predatory economics.

You can make this a lot more complicated, but when you\u0027re as far below capacity as we are it\u0027s really quite simple arithmetic.Read Post | CommentsMarlo Thomas, 05.25.2011Award-winning actress, author and activistFor all the walls we thought we\u0027d broken down with Free to Be -- and all the stereotypes we thought we\u0027d shattered -- children today are not free to be anything they want to be, and they are dying for it.Read Post | CommentsTrey Ellis, 05.25.2011Novelist, Screenwriter, and Associate Professor at Columbia UniversityIt\u0027s not class warfare for the government to protect all of its citizens from financial exploitation. It is what we assumed our government was there for in the first place. An Elizabeth Warren appointment would deliver this message forcefully.Read Post | CommentsJohann Hari, 05.25.2011Columnist, the London IndependentEcuador\u0027s government says that if the rest of the world offers just half of what the oil beneath their rainforest is worth -- $3.5 billion -- they will keep the rainforest standing and alive and working for us all.Read Post | CommentsCarolyn Maloney, 05.25.2011U.S. Representative from New YorkIt is beyond ironic that after years of grossly misleading Republican TV ads about \"death panels,\" \"government takeovers\" and other nonsense, the Republicans are now complaining about a Democratic candidate who simply tells the truth.Read Post | CommentsSigourney Weaver, 05.25.2011Academy Award nominated actressI keep thinking about Rachel Carson these days, because the current efforts to discredit climate scientists look a lot like the powerful resistance that met Carson\u0027s warnings about DDT.Read Post | CommentsRabbi Geoffrey A.

Wow. It\u0027s enough to make you want to take another look at Donald Trump.Read Post | CommentsArianna Huffington, 05.24.2011In times of economic stress, there is a tendency to look for the cause of problems in some identifiable \"other\" group, race, religion or country. But perhaps Pogo had it right: \"We have met the enemy and he is us.\"Read Post | CommentsRobert Reich, 05.25.2011Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Aftershock\u0027Paul Ryan still doesn\u0027t get it. He blames Tuesday\u0027s upset victory of Democrat Kathy Hochul over Republican Jane Corwin to represent NY-26 on Democratic scare tactics. Scare tactics? Seniors have every right to be scared of Ryan\u0027s plan.Read Post | CommentsRuth Bettelheim, Ph.D., 05.25.2011Psychotherapist, Marriage and Family Counselor, Edcuation Consultant, Life Coach, WriterHistory -- and the scenes flooding our TV sets today -- vividly illustrate that preparations for housing victims of large-scale disasters are critically lacking, even here in the US. But there is really no good reason for this.Read Post | CommentsErel Margalit, 05.25.2011Israeli venture capitalist and social entrepreneur; Candidate, Labor Party ChairmanTime and again, leaders are faced with crucial and difficult decisions. Mr. President, now is one of those times. We, as part of a new generation of leaders, must project our vision for how the nations of the Middle East can be built and rebuilt.Read Post | CommentsTherese Borchard, 05.25.2011Author of the blog, Beyond Blue, on Beliefnet.comBefore Prozac and Zoloft, music was my sole therapy. And I\u0027m not alone: the website of the American Music Therapy Association lists 57 pages of research articles chronicling the successful use of music to treat a host of different illnesses.Read Post | CommentsChris Weigant, 05.25.2011Political Writer and Blogger at ChrisWeigant.comIt\u0027s hard to deny that Democrats are feeling good about yesterday\u0027s election victory up in Buffalo. There\u0027s a certain wind-in-our-sails feeling about the whole strategy of hammering Republicans on the Ryan plan to voucherize Medicare.Read Post | CommentsRep. Louise Slaughter, 05.25.2011U.S. Congresswoman from New York\u0027s 28th DistrictWhen our nation\u0027s laws allow a troubled individual to purchase a gun, but can\u0027t hold that same person responsible for their actions, then it is clearer than ever that we need to act.Read Post | CommentsAngel Gurría, 05.25.2011Secretary-General, OECDWe could be forgiven for wondering if we have learned anything over the past few years. We would deserve less forgiveness if we were unwittingly preparing the ground for the next slump and no one sounded the alarm.Read Post | CommentsRep. Dana Rohrabacher, 05.25.2011U.S. Congressman from California\u0027s 46th DistrictIn the name of harmonizing our laws with other countries, Congress is about to dramatically diminish the patent protections offered to American innovators over the history of our Republic.Read Post | CommentsAndy Ostroy, 05.25.2011Political \u0026 pop culture analystIf Democrats were smart, they\u0027d co-opt Kathy Hochul\u0027s winning strategy and aggressively run with it nationally all the way to November 2012. The GOP\u0027s attack on Medicare is the absolute perfect bumper-sticker issue for them.Read Post | CommentsSen. Ron Wyden and Sen. Mark Udall, 05.25.2011Members of Congress are about to vote to extend the most controversial provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act for four more years, even though few of them understand how those provisions are being interpreted and applied.Read Post | CommentsUna LaMarche, 05.25.2011Editor of \u0027The Sassy Curmudgeon\u0027Wow, guys, can you believe we made it to the season finale?

Talk about efficiency.Read Post | CommentsDaphne Eviatar, 05.25.2011Senior Associate, Human Rights First’s Law and Security ProgramAs House Republicans continue to press for new and expanded war authority, the White House has issued a rare threat to veto any legislation that would needlessly expand the war on terror.Read Post | CommentsErin Gibson, 05.25.2011Comedian, Writer and host of Infomania\u0027 Modern Lady on Current TVRead Post | CommentsRichard B.
