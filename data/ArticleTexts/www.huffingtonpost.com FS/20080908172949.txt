What happened to the \"morning in America\" party of their patron saint Reagan? There\u0027s no optimism to these folks, just cynicism and disdain for the electorate: \"Hey, you\u0027re a women for Hillary...well, then you\u0027ll want to support our new VP (pay no attention to their hugely disparate views);\" disdain for the planet: \"drill, baby, drill!;\" disdain for the facts: \"Obama will raise taxes on the middle class and small businesses!\" (He cuts taxes much more than McCain for both groups.)Read Post | CommentsBIOJon Soltz, 09.08.2008Last week\u0027s convention sure made every superficial effort to come off as pro-Troop. And the media ate it up, not challenging a single thing. But to those of us who did serve, it was offense after offense after offense.Read Post | CommentsBIOAdam McKay, 09.08.2008\"Stop saying that!\" my wife says to me. But this is not a high school football game and I\u0027m not a cheerleader with a bad attitude. This is an election and as things stand now, we\u0027re gonna frickin\u0027 lose this thing.Read Post | Comments (394)BIOJoseph Romm, 09.08.2008Sarah Palin is selling a lie, just like McCain. If the Obama campaign won\u0027t explain that to the American people, McCain and Palin will win the national debates and likely go on to victory.Read Post | CommentsBIOJamie Lee Curtis, 09.07.2008When the Republicans had their convention and there were signs held high with the monikers....\"G.I. John and Superwoman\" I knew we were in trouble. They were selling a fantasy.Read Post | Comments (337)BIONaomi Foner, 09.07.2008Leaders need to be chosen from the most talented among us, not from the bottom of the barrel. And we shouldn\u0027t be afraid to say so.Read Post | Comments (21)BIOJane Smiley, 09.08.2008In Bob Woodward\u0027s new book, Condoleezza Rice hastens to remind us just how blind and stupid they have been, no doubt to make sure that no one in his or her right mind could possibly pull that \"Republican\" lever in the voting booth ever again.Read Post | CommentsBIOBruce Wilson, 09.07.2008Sarah Palin\u0027s churches are actively involved in a resurgent movement that was declared heretical by the Assemblies of God in 1949.Read Post | Comments (456)BIOTom Gregory, 09.08.2008Now that he has the legal right to marry, actor George Takei sat down with me enthusiastically gushing about his upcoming nuptials to his partner of twenty-one years, Brad Altman.Read Post | CommentsBIOBenjamin R. Barber, 09.07.2008War hero Kerry got swift-boated by men who never served in the military. Is Obama now going to let himself get moosed by a parochial Alaskan know-nothing because she\u0027s a woman?Read Post | Comments (270)BIOJoshuah Bearman, 09.08.2008You may be shocked to learn that not all stories from the convention were about tactics, or personalities, or disunity, or overcoming disunity, or yet more endless parsing of personalities and stagecraft.Read Post | CommentsBIOAndy Borowitz, 09.08.2008Gov. Palin\u0027s wisecrack was the last straw for Carol Foyler, the executive director of the Pitbull Anti-Defamation League: \"We\u0027re all like, first the Michael Vick thing, and now this.\"Read Post | CommentsBIOMichael Seitzman, 09.06.2008Anyone that tells you that you don\u0027t have a right to know should clarify exactly what they mean by the freedom they will defend with their very last breath.Read Post | Comments (100)Michael Shaw, 09.07.2008Ellis Weiner, 09.07.2008Hale \"Bonddad\" Stewart, 09.08.2008Steven Weber, 09.07.2008David Fiderer, 09.06.2008Oliver Willis, 09.07.2008Mia Farrow, 09.07.2008R.O.
