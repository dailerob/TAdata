{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, America finally began questioning the judgment of its generals. The problem is that the judgment being judged is about sexual conduct rather than military conduct. The real scandal is that U.S. and allied soldiers are still dying in Afghanistan at a rate of one per day, as America\u0027s longest war drags on. Gen. David Petraeus, who led our efforts in Afghanistan for a year, deserved public scrutiny long before Paula Broadwell and Jill Kelley finally brought it to him. The media bears plenty of culpability. If our failed military strategy in Afghanistan had gotten half the airtime of Petraeus\u0027 failed marital strategy in Tampa, there would be far fewer families mourning the loss of a truly fallen soldier. This Onion headline perfectly sums up our country\u0027s perverted priorities: \"Nation Horrified To Learn About War In Afghanistan While Reading Up On Petraeus Sex Scandal.\"Read Post | Comments (175)David Bromwich, 11/14/12Professor of Literature at YaleThe largest hope of 2012 surely rests not with the president, but with those senators of political skill and passion who have been elected or reelected.

I want millionaires and billionaires and Big Oil companies to pay their fair share. And I want to hold Wall Street accountable. But here\u0027s the honest truth: We\u0027ll never do any of that if we can\u0027t get up-or-down votes in the Senate.Read Post | Comments (2,114)Arianna Huffington, 11/14/12President Obama still has the opportunity to have a transformational presidency -- but, as he has said again and again, bringing about the changes we need is going to require the active participation of all of us.Read Post | Comments (726)D.L.

By voting for a conservative ideological agenda, they have actually hurt the poor, resisted immigration reform and promoted endless wars. There is a new evangelical agenda for a new evangelical demographic.Read Post | Comments (1,255)Donna Brazile and Will Crossley, 11/13/12For more than two years Republicans have campaigned and legislated against the right of certain groups of people to vote. The Republicans\u0027 strategy failed because it awakened the most powerful force in a democracy: the determination of the voters themselves.Read Post | Comments (1,047)Michelangelo Signorile, 11/16/12Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesHad the Log Cabin Republicans not endorsed Romney, they would now have more pull within the GOP. They would be able to tell GOP leaders, in the midst of the handwringing over the party\u0027s \"demographic problem,\" that had Romney backed off his harsh line on gay rights, they could have helped him win.Read Post | Comments (335)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 11/17/12Author, research psychologist and gender scholarIf science is telling us that drinking while pregnant is okay, why do we continue to judge the woman with the outstretched belly sipping from a glass of Merlot?
