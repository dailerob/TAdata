It doesn\u0027t work here, it doesn\u0027t work in Europe, it doesn\u0027t work for state and local governments. I\u0027m tempted to ask how many data points we need to recognize this crucial economic truth, but I\u0027m afraid data points don\u0027t have much to do with it. After last month\u0027s disappointing report, I was careful to point out that \"one month does not a trend make\" and there are some technical reasons -- mostly seasonal adjustments that haven\u0027t caught up with unusually warm weather -- to consider as well. Well, two months doesn\u0027t quite a trend make either, but it\u0027s getting closer.Read Post | Comments (315)Jason Linkins and Elyse Siegel, 05/04/12CNN is terrible.

Someone runs. Someone wins. People contribute money and get their hopes up. There is a weird sense that somehow all of your problems will be solved and the world will right itself if only you find the right contender.Read Post | Comments (19)Meathead, 05/04/12AmazingRibs.com, Barbecue Whisperer, Hedonism Evangelist, OmnivoreBourbon is the quintessential American whiskey and the drink of choice of many Southerners.

No set of policies between now and Election Day are likely to boost the economy.Read Post | Comments (467)Sandip Roy, 05/04/12Culture editor, Firstpost.com; editor, New America MediaThe book is coming out in June and although it\u0027s about much more than Obama\u0027s early love life, \"sexually warm\" is what is going to heat up the sales. With the presidential election getting into full swing, Obama is in need of a little bit of makeover.Read Post | Comments (11)Emilio Estevez, 05/04/12Writer, directorWhat could you possibly glean from a book about two men who\u0027ve been in the public eye for over fifty years, where everything there is to know about them can be uncovered by the click of keyboard?

No alchemy of eloquence can atone for the confession of moral surrender involved in such a boast.Read Post | Comments (728)Rep.
