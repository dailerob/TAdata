{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week, the mystery of Malaysian Airlines flight 370 took another turn when Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced that two objects -- one 80 feet long -- had been spotted by satellite 1,000 miles southwest of Australia. Multiple ships and planes were quickly dispatched, though the intensified search has turned up nothing so far. The story has transfixed the world, not least because of the shock that something the size of a 777 could just disappear in this era of 24/7 global surveillance. It\u0027s also tapped into our common humanity, as 26 nations are now assisting in the search. A grief-stricken mother who was carried out of a press conference on Wednesday brought the real stakes of finding the plane home. \"My dear,\" she cried. \"I don\u0027t know where my dear is -- twelve days! My son!\" The media is consumed by the mystery; the families of the passengers are left to deal with the misery.CommentsYulia TymoshenkoFmr. prime minister of Ukraine; Current leader of All-Ukrainian Union \"Fatherland\" (\"Batkivshchyna\")I feel sorry for the people of Russia. They are being led into a totalitarian abyss of economic and spiritual collapse which goes hand-in-hand with poverty and devastation. Using degrading and immoral means, the Russian government has destroyed the notion of truth with their mad propaganda for the occupation of Ukraine.Comments (498)Paul ReiserActor, writer and standup comedianDave Brenner was in our living room with remarkable regularity, a saturation level I\u0027ve never seen equaled since. He was a guest on the Tonight Show, he hosted the Tonight Show, he was on Merv Grif?n, he was on Mike Douglas (for weeks at a time), he was on game shows... and, it seemed to me, always with new material. That kind of proli?c consistency takes a lot of hard work and dedication -- something I sensed would hit home with my dad.Comments (26)Barbra StreisandSinger; Actress; Director; Composer; ActivistThe critics say we need industrial agriculture to feed the growing population of the world. We\u0027re told that we cannot go back to natural, regenerative, organic farming as the way we grow our food. In short, this isn\u0027t true.Comments (105)Rep. Debbie Wasserman SchultzAuthor, \u0027For the Next Generation\u0027; Chair, Democratic National CommitteeWhat the RNC and the Republican Party still don\u0027t understand is that their biggest problem has never been their primary calendar, their campaign tactics, or a lack of trainings. Their biggest problem is who they are, what they believe, what they say, and how they govern.Comments (293)Akbar S. AhmedSenior at Yale University from Karachi, PakistanWe Pakistanis are long past faith in our institutions -- often, we\u0027re the first to suspect that they\u0027ve played a hand in ruining our nation. We just don\u0027t like it when the West points that out.CommentsMark Ruffalo and Cyrus BuffumFor too long, we have paid little attention to our planet\u0027s most crucial natural resource: water.CommentsMohamed A. El-ErianChief Economic Advisor, AllianzThe consequences for both Europe and Russia would become significantly more dire if a complete breakdown in the dialogue on Ukraine were to lead to generalized trade and financial sanctions, including a disruption in Russian energy supplies to the West. Such an outcome would send Europe and Russia into recession and, most likely, reignite global financial instabilityComments (31)Paul Brandeis RaushenbushExecutive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostI grieve for Fred Phelps. The man spent a great portion of his time on earth using his gifts in such a hurtful, and ultimately silly way. But I won\u0027t picket his funeral. I won\u0027t dance on his grave. I will try not to emulate him in any way.Comments (80)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarThe more companies tell consumers they love us; the more they show us that they don\u0027t. Some say that modern retail is really a \"war to con consumers.\"Comments (22)Kareem Abdul-JabbarNBA Legend, Pop Culture columnistLike its gritty heroes, the show is mesmerizing, good-hearted, occasionally brilliant -- and occasionally flawed.Comments (40)Mark CubanOwner, Dallas Mavericks; Chairman, AXS TVLike Hollywood, today\u0027s nouveau entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley are looking past the pitch right in front of them to the next source of capital who will pay a higher valuation.CommentsNaomi CampbellModel, Actor, Activist, Mentor and Executive Producer of The FaceI get asked all the time what makes a model super, and while there\u0027s something to be said for hard work and having a special look -- a key element that separates a good model from an outstanding model is confidence.CommentsSeamus McKiernanSenior Blog Editor, Special Projects, Huffington PostWhat do you call a TV ad about Burger King, the NCAA, and a former college basketball player? I call it a glimpse into the messy world of college sports and big business. And that\u0027s exactly what\u0027s on display this month during March Madness.CommentsTed Danson and Andrew SharplessWhat if each time you bought a fish filet from a grocery store or restaurant, it included a side order of dead dolphin, drowned sea turtle, or other discarded sea life?CommentsArthur Chu\u0027Jeopardy!\u0027 champion, voice-over artist, actor, comedianI was, in short, famous. A celebrity. At the apex of my Warholian 15 minutes. And I\u0027m still not sure how the hell it happened.Comments (85)Greg LouganisFour-time Olympic gold medalist, gay man living with HIV, and activistYou will understand those confusing feelings you are having about \"who you love\" or fall in love with. It is your nature to love, and it is just who you are that you love a man. It is OK. You will survive your suicide attempt, and something glorious will happen.Comments (12)Rep. Louise SlaughterU.S. Congresswoman from New York\u0027s 25th DistrictTwo years ago today, a little-noticed, but profoundly important, trade agreement between the United States and South Korea took effect.Comments (50)Jim Yong KimPresident, World Bank GroupHere\u0027s a shameful statistic: Up to a third of the world\u0027s food is wasted. In the developing world, that\u0027s 400 to 500 calories per person per day. But in the developed world, it\u0027s as much as 1,500 calories per person.CommentsDavid Katz, M.D.Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterNo, it is not suddenly good to eat more saturated fat -- and the new study grabbing headlines showed no such thing. The study, a meta-analysis in the Annals of Internal Medicine, shows the following two things in particular: (1) you cannot get a good answer to a bad question; and (2) there is more than one way to eat badly.CommentsLewis LaphamEditor of Lapham\u0027s QuarterlyFor the last several years, the word \"revolution\" has been hanging around backstage on the national television talk-show circuit waiting for somebody, anybody -- visionary poet, unemployed automobile worker, late-night comedian -- to cue its appearance on camera.Comments (16)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersFox voiceovers loom: \"Food stamp abusers, eating on taxpayers.\" Then another, \"America\u0027s poor are actually living the good life\" -- quite a despicable comment revealing the perspective of those who have never lived with, worked with, or even been around poor people in America.Comments (121)Chi ShermanWriter, blogger, spoken word artistI got laid off from a full-time job due to the belly-up economy. I didn\u0027t realize just how much of my identity I had associated with \"being important\" -- dressing up, interacting with clients, being seen as a professional. Now I was aimless, wearing jeans and flip flops, and worrying about money in a way I never had before.Comments (70)TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"Why is it more prestigious to be a CEO than it is to take care of your family? Why aren\u0027t caregivers and breadwinners equally celebrated? And do women actually have more choices than men? Watch this provocative talk from public policy expert, wife and mother Anne-Marie Slaughter.Comments (156)Dr. Arthur F. Kirk, Jr.President, Saint Leo UniversityThis is a terrific time of year for fans of college sports as March Madness takes center stage. But big money, national fame and institutional pride too often overwhelm the best intentions of educators.CommentsAnn BrenoffSenior Writer, The Huffington PostI once suggested to my visiting 80-year-old aunt that we could spend the afternoon together shopping. \u0027Why?\u0027 she asked me, \u0027I don\u0027t need anything.\u0027 It was a generational disconnect of the first degree.Comments (51)Sen. Kirsten GillibrandU.S. Senator from New YorkBut when it comes to filling the fastest-growing jobs in our economy in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM), women do not come close. In fact, the latest census found that only 26 percent of STEM workers in the United States were women, meaning a full 74 percent of all STEM jobs are filled by men.Comments (14)Paige DavisEntrepreneur, mind-body enthusiast and recent breast cancer survivorThere is really nothing that can prepare you for a cancer diagnosis. It is a shocking and momentary devastation that is overwhelming on so many different levels -- physically, emotionally and spiritually. But perhaps the greatest challenge is identifying the immediate logistical next steps of what a diagnosis means while you are trying to process these levels.Comments (29)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThe NRA\u0027s very presence in this debate, the very fact that they planted this letter, is paradoxical evidence against the argument that the higher minimum wage comes exclusively out of workers\u0027 jobs and higher prices.Comments (22)Debra PickettAuthor, \u0027Reporting Lives\u0027; Media Consultant; Former Newspaper Columnist; Mom of 3 BoysI was having one of those working mom moments when you feel all conflicted and then get mad at yourself for feeling all conflicted because the men in the office certainly aren\u0027t and then you either go the rest room and cry for minute or pull yourself together and get on with your day.CommentsKiri WestbyChangemaker, Rulebreaker, StorytellerIn light of our very recent emancipation from the illegality of pot, I say it\u0027s high time that we lift the veil on marijuana and motherhood.Comments (678)Anthony Silard, 2014.23.03Bill Couzens, 2014.23.03Gary Hart, 2014.23.03UCLA Inst. of the Environment and Sustainability, 2014.23.03KnowMore TV, 2014.23.03Soren Petersen, 2014.23.03Sherman Yellen, 2014.23.03The Daily Meal, 2014.23.03Shannyn Moore, 2014.23.03CraftFoxes, 2014.23.03Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"\u0027TOTAL DEVASTATION\u0027 18 Still Missing In Deadly Washington Mudslide",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
