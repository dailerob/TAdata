{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureFast track is The Money directing Congress to go utterly against what vast majorities of people actively say, what movements of people are fighting for. This goes beyond the Iraq War vote, because there were blocks of the public on both sides of that fight -- even if the \"pro\" block was largely manufactured by propaganda. This goes beyond the public bailout of Wall Street (but not the rest of us), because there was no time for opposition to rally, and there was no crisis or panic to manipulate. This time they just went ahead and did it and didn\u0027t care how it looked. Is this how business will be done in the 21st century? Maybe, but maybe not. We the People came close to winning this time. We will come closer and closer, then we will start winning again.Roger Ekirch is a professor of history at Virginia Tech and a leading scholar on segmented sleep -- the idea that for much of history people slept into two separate chunks separated by a waking period. In answer to my questions, he shared his insights on \"normal\" insomnia, how technological advances have changed the way we sleep, and why in many ways we\u0027re living in a golden age of sleep.Over the last 40 years, the largest corporations in this country have closed thousands of factories in the United States and outsourced millions of American jobs to low-wage countries overseas. That is why we need a new trade policy and why I am opposed to the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership now before Congress.U.S. Senator from VermontLast week in Charleston we were tragically reminded yet again that domestic extremists pose a serious threat to our society. And the threat they pose is magnified many times over when extremists like self-confessed shooter Dylann Roof have firearms.National Director, Anti-Defamation LeagueOur focus on only one type of ideological terrorist risk creates what economists call availability heuristics, where fears about the frequency of events come to frame an inaccurate understanding of them. With everything from terrorism to vehicular accidents, our risks are broader than our fears dictate.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityLike Bilbo, most of us are like butter scraped over too much bread. If you don\u0027t purposefully carve time out every day to progress and improve? --? without question, your time will get lost in the vacuum of our increasingly crowded lives.Foster parent of 3. Pursuing Ph.D. in Org Psychology. Entrepreneur. Blogger. Visit www.benjaminhardy.com or connect @BenjaminPHardy.I am sorry for the legions of people who have said, done and prayed unimaginable, exclusionary and degrading things in the name of God. I am convinced beyond a doubt God loves each and every part of us as we are created, including our sexual identities.Pastor of Christ Church: Portland, an open, active \u0026 inclusive faith community for God\u0027s glory \u0026 neighbor\u0027s good.In April I wrote about a landmark Dutch lawsuit on climate action that, if successful, would put the world\u0027s governments on notice. Today the Hague District Court ruled in favor of the Urgenda Foundation and its nearly 900 co-plaintiffs. The court\u0027s findings are extraordinary and could set precedent in cases around the world.Campaign consultantJeb! is secular sometimes, and faithful and devout at other times. It all depends on where he is and who he is talking to. 50 states allows for 50 shades of Jeb!\u0027s religious conviction.Professor of Theater, Ursinus CollegeThe most salient \"add-on\" feature of the TPP is its investor-state dispute settlement mechanism, which gives investors private rights of action against governments outside the court system. The problem is not so much that it violates rule of law and sovereignty, but that it shrinks the actual and potential role of the public.Cornell University professor of international economic lawI would like to think I\u0027m black. And at first glance, it\u0027s apparent I am. My skin and hair say so. And if anything, I\u0027ve got a birth certificate that solidifies my heritage. I would like to think I\u0027m black. But sometimes, I\u0027m not sure if others of my race agree.Sophomore at the University of AlabamaIf we do nothing to create meaningful reform, the black homeowners of 2031 will have just 22 percent of the wealth of their white counterparts. That\u0027s a larger gap than before the housing bubble burst of 2008. This is not merely a concern; it\u0027s an impending crisis.Director, ACLU National Office\u0027s Racial Justice ProgramOur lives, beginning when we were teenagers, have distinctly different aspects and are affected in ways that teenagers today are usually still not talking about. As young as 11 or 12, different rules and double standards based on gender begin to alter our day-to-day experiences in subtle, and often not-so-subtle, ways.Feminist, writer, and satirist (not always in that order)Democratic capitalism arose hand-in-hand with the industrial age. If it\u0027s to survive the transition to a knowledge age and the digital economy, it will have to change -- profoundly.Advisor to government and business leaders; Author, The Digital Economy, 20th Anniversary EditionThe Arctic is screaming. Can you hear her in the floods of Houston, the drought in California and the epic snowfall in Boston this past winter? Our collective failure to limit greenhouse gas emissions has pushed atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide to levels not seen for millions of years.Executive Director of Alaska Institute for Justice; Senior Research scientist at the University of Alaska FairbanksWhat are Republicans afraid of? What is so threatening or wrong about giving women the ability to space or limit their pregnancies? Why is it that a party that has pushed so hard to defend privacy and personal liberties in so many other realms is so dead-set on depriving women of their reproductive choice?President, Population InstituteThere are many threads to the reformy movement in education, but perhaps the most predominant one is the push for privatization. Many folks look at education and they just see a gigantic pile of money that has previously gone untouched.Teacher and writer; blogger, curmudgucation.blogspot.comAmidst declining music sales, many record label executives, artists and outside observers have claimed that the current system of streaming music for free is broken, unsustainable, and -- according to Björk -- \"insane.\" But is it really? When we get down to the economics of it, the short answer is, no.Economist, professorIf you\u0027re new to the gym you may be intimidated, but if you follow these simple guidelines, it will ease your transition from couch potato to gym rat.Owner, tamimcvay.com, Wellness \u0026 Lifestyle Coach helping overwhelmed women feel confident and stronger so they can do more of what they loveThe killings in Charleston, South Carolina have produced a lot of talk about healing and forgiveness, some important discussion of racism in the United States, and not enough attention to gun control.Social studies educator, Hofstra University, my opinions, of course, are my ownGov. Bentley probably wanted to have a legislature vote but wouldn\u0027t get much support from the conservative politicians. Some say, \"Let\u0027s vote on the Confederate flag,\" but given the failure of prior referendums and the angst from the state debate over that issue, Bentley reasoned that it just wasn\u0027t going to work in Alabama.Political science professor, LaGrange College in GeorgiaI\u0027ve let them see me work hard and succeed, and work hard and fail. My career hasn\u0027t been a straight line, by any means, and I never hid that from them. All the while, the underlying lesson has been how much work goes into work and how important resilience is, demonstrated over a lot of years.Chair, Ellevate; Past Head; Merrill Lynch and Smith Barney; Investor; Board Member; Crazed UNC Basketball Fan.; MomNothing we need to do as a nation is possible unless we limit the political power of the moneyed interests. So we made one more video -- the one accompanying this post -- and it\u0027s incredibly important you share this one, too.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Republicans must go beyond the flag debate to confront the simmering ideological stew on the far right. The idea of nullification in its own way is equally odious. It is a failed constitutional theory that should likewise be banished to a museum of legal antiquities.Professor of Law, University of St. ThomasThe queer world still exists apart -- discrete, you might say -- from the straight world, and to be a bisexual woman on OKCupid is to travel back and forth between them, bicoastal, bilingual, bicultural, always apologizing to one on behalf of the other.To uproot this racism at every level in which it manifests, we need a systematic program.Business sees its role as making money, not advocacy. But that is a false fear. Solving climate change isn\u0027t all that controversial anymore, and fixing the problem is directly tied to future corporate profits.Author, \u0027Getting Green Done\u0027Sure, diet and exercise consistency matter, but there may be other habits that are interfering with your goals. Habits that you don\u0027t even realize are sabotaging your efforts.What if the bottle you see on the shelf already knew what was going to happen before you put it in your shopping cart?A new way to understand \u0026 talk about wine, beer \u0026 cocktailsWe love to rescue puppies and heal little birds with broken wings, expecting that they will then cleave to us and love us forever. Sadly, in real life, when you release a frightened, wounded animal from a trap, the first thing it usually does is to bite your face off.Film and TV writer and producer; author, \u0027Love Addict: Sex, Romance and Other Dangerous Drugs\u0027My interest in old-fashioned crafts comes from generations past. I spent my first days wrapped up in an afghan made by my great-aunt.
