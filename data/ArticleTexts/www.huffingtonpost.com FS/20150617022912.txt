{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Fellow, Roosevelt Institute; author of \u0027Fighting for Our Health\u0027In her campaign launch speech on Roosevelt Island, Hillary Clinton talked about her fight for an \"economy that works for everyday Americans, not just those at the top.\" That rallying cry is becoming the core economic message of more and more Democrats. That may seem like just rhetoric, but it\u0027s an important advance. The story of an economy, government and democracy that work for all of us, not just the wealthy, has proven to have tremendous narrative power. But stories need more than a quest -- they need to be able to explain who the villains are and what they did wrong, who the heroes are and how they realize the quest. What is the rest of the story in Clinton\u0027s address, and how much of it does she get right?James Proud is the founder and CEO of Hello, the maker of Sense, a bedside device that tracks your sleep and your sleeping environment. In answer to my questions, he shared his insights on why what you keep in your bedroom matters, the link between sleep and decision-making, and the potential of new tech tools can improve our lives.I once spent $5 on lottery tickets out of desperation, despite knowing as a math teacher that the probability of winning was essentially zero. But I teach, hoping that it will get better for me, for my students, and for my own kid who falls into that strange not-rich, not-poor-enough no man\u0027s land. There is no middle class that we fit into.Math teacherThe territory into which the Republicans have strayed with Benghazi is starkly unpatriotic. Their use of purloined information undermines our ability to act and react in a dangerous world and provides comfort to our enemies.Retired AmbassadorI live and teach in the same community as Rachel Dolezal. \"What are you?\" is an anxiety-producing question for me and for many mixed people. Calls for \"proof\" of heritage overlook the oppressive histories people of color have with respect to documentation.Professor of Women’s and Gender Studies at Gonzaga University in Spokane, WAIn the upcoming performance art piece called the GOP presidential debates the candidates will try to one-up each other showing their base who\u0027s best at crushing labor unions, disciplining the poor, and striking fear in the hearts of America\u0027s enemies.Professor, historian, authorRachel Dolezal\u0027s actions are a potential pitfall for any White people on the journey towards recognizing the truth of what it means to be White and accepting responsibility for it. But we cannot not be White. And we cannot undo what Whiteness has done. We can only start from where we are and who we are.Teacher educator, consultant, writer, filmmakerIt is important to remember the game is far from over. This is one of those bills, like the TARP, where we are playing by rich people\u0027s rules. That means that the other guys get to have do overs until they get the outcome they want.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Being gay isn\u0027t something you choose, but you do face choices about whether and how to discuss it. I was well into adulthood before I was prepared to acknowledge the simple fact that I am gay. It took years of struggle for me to recognize that it\u0027s just a fact of life, like having brown hair.Mayor, South Bend, IndianaWe\u0027ve always been straightforward about language in our house. Words are neither \"good\" nor \"bad,\" but some words are for Grownups Only. Somehow this has worked, and we are extremely lucky Sadie doesn\u0027t swear like a sailor. Jury is still out on Polly.WriterWhen we look at church history, as well as the modern church, it seems to me that many of the problems have grown out of believers receiving a salary from other believers.Author, \u0027An Outsider\u0027s Guide to the Gospel\u0027I\u0027d tried to talk myself out of this many times. I knew this could go very, very badly in quite a number of ways. But I saw too much of myself in this dog. I knew what she needed. We had that understanding already.Writer. Raising two smart, funny, strong little ladies. Probably in Carhartts. Coffee.While her upbringing in a white family with adopted black children and her education at predominantly black institutions in Mississippi and Washington, D.C. had an impact on her apparent genuine empathy and self-identity, they simply do not translate into a license to deceive constituents on actual facts about her lineage.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityArtful advocates advise this about addressing the court: if the facts are on your side, pound the facts; if the law is on your side, pound the law; if neither is on your side, pound the table. Adding to that adage, pusillanimous politicians propose undressing the court: if you fear its decision, strip it of jurisdiction.Professor of Law, Washburn UniversityIsn\u0027t it, too, almost an indecent albeit dangerous spectacle of the European Union, a superpower, to go on threatening, when not cajoling, the government of a small member-state on its strategic southern periphery?Emeritus Professor of Economics, University of AthensI\u0027m a black adoptee who grew up in a rural, predominantly white town, with a white family. And what strikes me as the most perverse and pathological aspect of this story is Dolezal\u0027s relationship to -- and ultimate identity theft of -- her black adoptive siblings.Director of Digital Media and Marketing at Scenarios USAYoung white people are seen as \"kids,\" prone to make mistakes, well into their twenties. But a 12-year-old black kid is seen as a dangerous criminal once he is old enough to play alone in the park.Filmmaker, Brave New FoundationPresident, Dream Corps Unlimited; Author of NY Times bestseller, \u0027The Green-Collar Economy\u0027In college, I was turned away from attending a trip to work with youth in Jamaica because I was told I was \"too white\" to attend. In law school, different black student groups reached out to me to participate in their activities -- until they realized I was \"white.\"Sassy, outspoken, \u0026 passionate about equal rights. Blogger at The Color Coded Life.I have friends, just not a lot of them. After a lot of thinking, and a pot of coffee, I have discovered the reason: As a super best friend, I flat out suck, but I do make a good horrible best friend.Blogger at LisaRPetty.com (Petty Thoughts), Mom, Wife, and all around awkward cat ladyWhat has truly left me with nightmares was not the unthinking destruction of the earthquake, but the sad, avoidable, human failures of the rescue efforts.Management professionalThere\u0027s nothing glamorous about dealing with anxiety. We pretty much live in \"crisis mode\" and trust us, we are so tired of getting worked up over the following things. So very tired.Our mission is to help people love their best.One of the more difficult things to do, for many of us at least, is to react in the moment, when injustice is occurring right in front our eyes, but in a way that does not directly affect us. The \"safe\" thing to do is avoid the conflict, to get away and certainly not get involved. However, there are times when the safe thing to do is not the right thing to do.Author of \u0027Obama’s America: A Transformative Vision of Our National Identity\u0027There is nothing worse than having your treasured food souvenirs get unceremoniously dumped in some undeserving airport trashcan.All things food and drinkIf gun sales are supposedly \"red hot,\" why are gun manufacturers struggling, even filing for bankruptcy? The answers include a gun glut and long-term trends in gun ownership in America.Political science professor, LaGrange College in GeorgiaSince having children, I\u0027ve noticed that my vagina has taken on a duel persona. Persona #1: a normal vagina. Persona #2: a flaccid balloon.Mum, writer, singer, pilotUnless you are prepared to be a bigot, you cannot say what gender Caitlyn Jenner should or should not be. You cannot invoke God or the history of women\u0027s oppression to render judgment on how she should choose to express her identity as a transgender woman.Science and Religion Correspondent for the Humanist MagazinePoverty is a pervasive concern in high fertility countries. The world has made progress in reducing severe poverty, but it\u0027s been exceedingly slow in countries where population growth rates remain high. While family planning can reduce demographic vulnerability, developing countries also require other forms of assistance.President, Population InstituteJeb Bush could wind up being America\u0027s next president. That\u0027s a statement that my fingers would actually refuse to type for several other Republicans, just because attempting to substitute \"Donald Trump\" or \"Carly Fiorina\" in that sentence would be so downright laughable.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comI did not \"rescue\" my boys any more than I rescued my daughter from my womb. I welcomed all of my children into my home as members of my family. We had no way to predict how successful it would be but we gave it our all. Did I get lucky? Absolutely, four times over.Mom, wife, healthcare data analyst.Most Americans lack any clear sense of what the military does; they certainly care less than they should; but what they are willing to do is to \"salute\" the troops by buying a beer in a red-white-and-blue can or putting a magnetic ribbon on their SUV as an expression of \"support.\"Writer, Professor, Retired Lt. Colonel, Air ForceOn those nights that you struggle to turn off the day and quiet your thoughts, a little motivation and encouragement may be helpful for sleep.Writer, Content Manager at AmerisleepGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
