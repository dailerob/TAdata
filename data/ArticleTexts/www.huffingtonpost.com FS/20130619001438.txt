{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jason LinkinsEditor, Eat the PressIn an op-ed in Politico, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has taken a firm stand against Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. And that\u0027s great. It\u0027s about time that someone took on Bobby Jindal for doing all the stuff Bobby Jindal\u0027s been doing lately that Bobby Jindal is just sick to death of. Might as well be Bobby Jindal! See, today, Bobby Jindal is letting the world know that he is tired of the way the Republican Party keeps on with this relentless, post-2012 election self-critique. \"We\u0027ve had enough,\" writes Jindal, adding, \"Enough, already.\" In Bobby Jindal\u0027s estimation, \"excessive navel gazing leads to paralysis\" and \"at present it looks as if the entire Republican party needs to go to counseling.\"Comments (481)Rita LoboBrazilian journalist, writer and activistLast week the governments of Rio and São Paulo, Brazil\u0027s two biggest cities raised the cost of the bus fare by R$0.20 (£0.06). It might sound like a negligible amount of money, but it was enough to trigger the biggest public uprisings the country has seen in over two decades.Comments (99)Robert ScheerEditor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027For defense contractors, the government officials who write them mega checks, and the hawks in the media who cheer them on, the name of the game is threat inflation. And no one has been better at it than the folks at Booz Allen Hamilton.Comments (216)Julie JensenWife, mother, digital media veteran, stroke survivorI\u0027m sure I\u0027d still be searching for fulfillment if I didn\u0027t receive a wake-up call on September 30, 2004. I was 26 when I was wheeled into the ER and a nurse asked if I knew what was happening. \"I think I had a stroke,\" I muttered. \"Ma\u0027am, you are HAVING a stroke.\"Comments (23)Mike HoganExecutive Arts and Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post Media GroupDon Draper doesn\u0027t kill people. He doesn\u0027t cook or deal drugs. He doesn\u0027t oversee an organized-crime syndicate. Hell, he doesn\u0027t even use the F-word. But there\u0027s no question he\u0027s a bastard. He lies. He cheats. He undermines his colleagues in ways both overt and underhanded. And yet, in spite of it all, there has always been something about Don that makes us love him anyway. We know what a scoundrel he is, but we just can\u0027t quit him.Comments (30)Nick TurseManaging Editor, TomDispatch.comTen years after Washington began pouring taxpayer dollars into counterterrorism and stability efforts across Africa, the continent has experienced profound changes, just not those the U.S. sought.Comments (12)Mike JulianelleBlogger, DadandBuried.comOf course, being exhausted is not just for parents. Once you hit a certain age, energy is just harder to come by; pretty much everyone I know is exhausted all the time. It\u0027s just life. But as a parent, there is one primary reason I am always so tired.Comments (135)J.C. McKeownAuthorSex hasn\u0027t changed much; we are still on that same quest, and many of the sexual attitudes from two and a half thousand years ago are still around today -- but there are also some radical differences.Comments (207)Shimon PeresPresident of the State of IsraelWe don\u0027t have enemies. There is no country, no religion, which we consider an enemy. Our only enemies are those who reject peace, sow division, and spread hatred.Comments (139)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkNobody should be denied the right to vote, or face additional hurdles because of a strategic method to disenfranchise them. Just as no one should be racially profiled, no one should be racially blocked from the voting booth.Comments (360)Ethan NadelmannExecutive Director, Drug Policy AllianceThe magnitude of our victories in Colorado and Washington makes what once appeared impossible -- drug law reforms grounded in science, compassion, health and human rights -- seemingly inevitable.Comments (98)Grown And FlownAuthors, Goldman Sachs: The Culture of SuccessI let go of the burning ambition I once held because I didn\u0027t feel as though I could hold it and three babies at the same time. My husband did not do this, my children did not do this, I did this.Comments (294)DJ Louie XIVDJLike the majority of our generation, knowing that we feed into our own misery by engaging in the grown-up high school cafeteria known as Twitter and emptying our increasingly scant bank-accounts on a smorgasbord of Apple products, this man has an uncanny comfort with being a complete and total hypocrite, a quality that my mom, admirably if aberrantly, does not possess. So yes, Kanye West is perhaps morally reprehensible. But he is also the most perfectly polished mirror we have.CommentsZach HindinWriter and musician based in Harlem.Almost immediately, the press invoked George Orwell to characterize the drama unfolding around Edward Snowden\u0027s revelation of the NSA\u0027s digitally omniscient domestic surveillance program. It should have been Aldous Huxley.Comments (23)Suzan Haskins and Dan PrescherInternationalLiving.com EditorsIf you\u0027re old enough to collect Social Security, there may be no better place to live right now than Latin America.Comments (20)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027It isn\u0027t often that progressives in the United States have much to celebrate. After all, the news has swung between bad and worse for most of the last three decades. That is why we should be celebrating the victory over the Campaign to Fix the Debt and its efforts to cut Social Security and Medicare.Comments (143)Don BacigalupiPresident, Crystal Bridges Museum of American ArtWe live now in permissive times -- art historically speaking -- when any and all art-making approaches are potentially viable, especially so if they riff on, reuse, or recycle the past. And so to be confronted with a monumental example of Minimalist art may be jarring.CommentsEric E. SterlingPresident, Criminal Justice Policy FoundationYou would think that Eric Holder, the first African American Attorney General, and Barack Obama, the first African American President, would be vigilant that there was no racial discrimination in the Justice Department of their Administration. You would think.Comments (33)Daddy-OHip-hop historian, music technologist, founder of StetsasonicThere is no political correctness in my rant. Just facts. Without diversity, there is no hip-hop, even if you choose to call it that. Hip-hop is not a reality TV show. Hip-hop is not a pair of pants sagging. Hip-hop has founders, innovation, and purpose.Comments (25)Simon JohnsonAuthor, \u0027White House Burning: The Founding Fathers, Our National Debt, and Why It Matters To You\u0027Global megabanks are pushing back hard against the idea that additional reforms are needed -- beyond what is supposed to be implemented as part of the Dodd-Frank 2010 financial legislation.Comments (219)Jill KnappAdjunct Professor in PsychologyWe all compromise -- a concert of a band we don\u0027t like here, a restaurant we could do without there -- but make sure you aren\u0027t changing to the point where you don\u0027t recognize the person you\u0027re becomingCommentsCurtis ValentineEducation AdvocateWhile school system governance, school choice and school closings have dominated recent discussions about school reform, the beginning of summer break is a perfect time to highlight the impact summer learning loss has on efforts to close achievement gaps.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorContrary to conservative claims that the food stamp, or SNAP, program has run amok, participation is high for a reason: there are still a lot of folks struggling to provide their families with adequate nutrition.Comments (21)Adam GrantWharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027In a classic study, sociologist Mark Granovetter showed that people were 58 percent more likely to get a new job through weak ties than strong ties. How could acquaintances be more helpful than good friends?CommentsClaudia ZelevanskyWriter, director, educator \u0026 arts consultantThe city in the summer is a special case. If you have ever spent more than 30 seconds on a subway platform during rush hour in August, you will know of what I speak.Comments (13)Randall RothenbergPresident and CEO, Interactive Advertising BureauYesterday, Cannes Lions Award winners were revealed and I attended the AOL Makers dinner where I was able to talk with some of the most amazing women in history who are still trailblazing today.CommentsGlennon MeltonBlogger, MomasteryBut then he said, \"Listen, mom. It\u0027s okay that you\u0027re not perfect. Nobody\u0027s perfect. You know, when you\u0027re not perfect, I remember that I don\u0027t have to be perfect, either. It\u0027s a relief sometimes.\"Comments (42)FoodbeastSeriously, guys. Your design team had one job. You couldn\u0027t have at least gotten the old man\u0027s uniform right?Comments (438)Maureen RyanTV critic, The Huffington PostTonight we found out that Bob is not truly a product of the great state of Wisconsin (your loss, Cheddarheads). His identity is as thin and fragile as the pathetic map tacked up on his office wall.Comments (189)Flynt and Hillary Mann LeverettAuthors, \u0027Going to Tehran\u0027; Penn State Professor and American University Senior LecturerIf the Obama administration wants to engage a new Rohani administration effectively, and to put U.S.-Iranian relations on a more positive trajectory, it will need to overhaul U.S. policy in four fundamental ways.Comments (67)Melanie CurtinFounder, Vixen On The LooseThis is in an attempt to spare both you, my fine male friends, as well as myself and other women, the cringe-inducing effects of such attempts at, um, seduction.Comments (1,456)Saleem H.
