{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"I\u0027m happy to announce a new addition to our cultural coverage: the launch of HuffPost TV. Our new page is somewhat of a re-launch -- the site was formerly known as AOL TV. In its new incarnation, HuffPost TV will have many of the same features you\u0027ve come to know: exclusive interviews and clips, reviews and recaps, and TV listings. But now, we\u0027re adding HuffPost\u0027s powerful blog and community platforms to the mix, giving you an even more comprehensive -- and much more social -- look at everything happening in the world of TV, both onscreen and off. We kick things off today with a great lineup of bloggers, starting with my pal and HuffPost favorite Bill Maher, who offers an appreciation of TV, Aaron Sorkin on the genius and legacy of Sid Caesar and TV pioneer Norman Lear on how he landed his first TV writing job. So... happy viewing, and as always, let us know what you think.Read Post | Comments (150)Bill Maher, 12/14/11Host of HBO\u0027s \"Real Time with Bill Maher\"On the inevitable occasion of the Huffington Post\u0027s entrée into television, it behooves me to say a few words about the business, and occasional art, of television.Read Post | Comments (141)Aaron Sorkin, 12/14/11Playwright, screenwriter and television writerI hope as the Huffington Post launches its coverage of television they remember that at any given hour in the day, there are about 600 choices of what to watch. 599 of them will be bad -- one of them will be Sid Caesar.Read Post | Comments (53)Norman Lear, 12/14/11Founder, People for the American WayMy writing partner Ed Simmons and I were living in L.A. with our families in the summer of 1950, selling living room furniture door to door to support ourselves while trying to break into show business.Read Post | Comments (14)Eli Pariser, 12/14/11Author, \u0027The Filter Bubble: What The Internet is Hiding from You\u0027There\u0027s a shift in how information is flowing online -- and it\u0027s invisible. But if we don\u0027t pay attention to it, it could become a real problem.Read Post | CommentsDr. Peggy Drexler, 12/14/11Author, \u0027Our Fathers Ourselves. Daughters, Fathers, And The Changing American Family\u0027How did the heart of a nation\u0027s leadership selection turn into a predictable reality show, where damaged players arrive in a limo, melt down and get voted off? And... how much more of this can Republican voters take?Read Post | CommentsRobert Reich, 12/14/11Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Aftershock\u0027We heard what you said last week about the dangers of the increasing concentration of income and wealth at the top. We agree. And many of us are prepared to work our hearts out to get you reelected -- as long as you commit to doing what needs to be done in your second term.Read Post | Comments (14)Dr. Phil McGraw, 12/14/11Author, Host \"Dr. Phil\"If you are ensconced in a slightly or even seriously dysfunctional group called \"family\" then read on for what to do to avoid the seasonal mayhem and have happier holidays.Read Post | Comments (13)Michael R. Bloomberg, 12/14/11108th Mayor of the City of New YorkCoal-fired power plants and the pollution they produce are the number one threat to our public health and the environment. This is not an issue of jobs versus the environment. It\u0027s an issue of the American people\u0027s public health versus a narrow special interest.Read Post | Comments (142)Sarah Brown, 12/13/11Global Patron, White Ribbon Alliance for Safe MotherhoodA mother will always fight for the best for her child; we must fight for the mother so she can do this. And by working together we can achieve this.Read Post | CommentsSusan Boyle, 12/13/11SingerIt was hard, unearthing deep wounds of my childhood, but much like the documentary, if people knew me and had a better insight, then hopefully that would bring understanding and acceptance.Read Post | Comments (46)Robert Creamer, 12/14/11Political organizer, strategist, author, partner Democracy PartnersThe end of the Iraq War demonstrates that \"Yes We Can!\" is more than a campaign slogan. It reminds us once again that everyday people can successfully organize to change history.Read Post | Comments (82)Michael Hogan, 12/14/11Executive Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post Media GroupThere\u0027s something about the rhythm -- \"we watch it every week\" -- and the comforting mass-appeal of it all. Music is made for cliques; movies are made for audiences; TV is made for America!Read Post | CommentsIbrahim Abdul-Matin, 12/14/11Author, \u0027Green Deen: What Islam Teaches About Protecting the Planet\u0027What if the first thing Tim Tebow said in interviews was: \"First, I would like to thank Allah and send blessings upon Prophet Muhammad.\" Would America think God was on his side then?Read Post | Comments (17)Margaret Cho, 12/14/11Comedian, actor and recording artistThe sadness I feel about Lindsay has more to do with the media\u0027s casting her as Marilyn Monroe, swaddled in red velvet, sad eyes and vermillion lips, and framing her story as if it has already ended.Read Post | CommentsMichael Roth, 12/14/11President, Wesleyan UniversityWe are connecting our schools to the worlds of public life, the economy and the broader culture.Read Post | CommentsTherese Borchard, 12/14/11Author, \u0027Beyond Blue\u0027 and \u0027The Pocket Therapist\u0027George Burns once said: \"Happiness is having a large, loving, caring, close-knit family in another city.\" So that would explain why the holidays are so stressful.Read Post | Comments (15)Maureen Ryan, 12/14/11TV critic, The Huffington PostYou learn two things as soon as you become a television critic: First, everyone thinks you have an awesome job. Second, almost everyone thinks they can do your job.Read Post | CommentsEvan Shapiro, 12/14/11President, IFCTo say that television is going to be replaced by online video -- or by anything else -- both misinterprets the facts and misunderstands the very definition of TV.Read Post | Comments (22)Graham Nash, 12/14/11Singer-Songwriter, Photographer and ActivistRegardless of whether you think that Bradley Manning is right or wrong, innocent or guilty, hero or villain, saint or sinner, he is a human being and should be treated as such.Read Post | Comments (53)Chris Dodd, 12/14/11Chairman and CEO, Motion Picture Association of America; Fmr. U.S. SenatorDoes freedom of speech require the freedom to steal? That\u0027s what some are arguing, comparing our efforts to protect American jobs from international criminal enterprises who profit from the theft of intellectual property online to the censorship policies of repressive regimes.Read Post | CommentsMichael Shaw, 12/14/11Publisher of BagNewsNotes, topping LIFE.com\u0027s 2011 Best Photo BlogsIf there\u0027s really something to worry about here, it\u0027s the destruction of the opportunity for a more nuanced discussion.Read Post | CommentsBeth Broderick, 12/13/11Actress, founding member of MOMENTUMToday, there are almost no facilities in Los Angeles that can house a homeless woman with her children. I am so grateful to Good Shepherd for answering their need and for taking my call on that dark night so long ago.Read Post | Comments (16)Larry Magid, 12/14/11Technology JournalistIt\u0027s a good thing schools don\u0027t treat books and sports the way most treat social media. Completely blocking domains like Facebook.com or YouTube.com denies kids access to some incredibly useful material.Read Post | CommentsStephen Grynberg, 12/14/11Award-winning filmmaker, writer and a founding member of The Men’s Advisory Council to The Rape FoundationA \"moment of silence\" opened Penn State\u0027s first football game after the Sandusky case was reported. The sports reporters reflected on the communal sadness and then cut to the highlights. No one said that silence was the wrong message.Read Post | CommentsSheryl Sandberg, 12/13/11Chief Operating Officer, FacebookEven as people worry about \"The End of Men,\" we have to acknowledge that men still run the world. Our revolution has stalled.Read Post | CommentsRep.
