{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Gary HartUnited States Senator (Ret.)\"...And finally tonight we bring you Making a Difference.\" This is a news network policy of closing an evening news program largely featuring wars, violence, and the worst of human behavior. Safe landings are not news; crashes are news. But we must not be left without hope. For many of us, what makes life worthwhile is to focus on safe landings and those who make a difference every day, every year. Today my heart is full of gratitude for the lives of a surprising number of heroes I have been privileged to know, and I hope that examples of quiet heroism will inspire the nation toward a sense of social justice that treats all children, including the one in four in poverty, as our nation\u0027s greatest treasure, our heritage, and the hope of the future.CommentsPadmini ParthasarathyJournalist based in New York, NYI was raised an American Hindu who feels more nostalgia for December pine in New York than October sulfur in Mumbai. I didn\u0027t think I would see a Christmas tree this year. And this one was startlingly alive, outside, swaying between private mourning and public celebration.CommentsMark C. MillerHumoristSay you arrive one day for an important job interview, but find there\u0027s no job, no interviewer and no office. Instead, as soon as you open the door, you find festive balloons and 20 people in an apartment shouting to you, \"Welcome to your new home!\"CommentsAdam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; co-founder of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911The day after Christmas means a lot of different things to a lot of different people - obligatory gift returns, post-Christmas sales, pouring the last of the eggnog in your coffee, an end to holiday music in public spaces and on public airwaves.CommentsJulie TarneyWriterMy heart swelled as I patted Harry\u0027s head. He was happy, and so was I. Because while too many people questioned my young son\u0027s preferences, and therefore my skills as a mother, we both stood strong with a cartoon rabbit who carried an anvil in his pink purse.Comments (22)Justin Talbot ZornPublic Service Fellow, Harvard UniversityWhile progressives have sought more Fed transparency , the left\u0027s preference has been to boost employment through Fed-fueled consumer demand. This could change.Comments (24)Bruce AckermanProfessor of law and political science, Yale; Author \u0027The Decline and Fall of the American Republic\u0027President Obama should not allow the NSA to convince him that his reform program is merely an idealistic wishlist that ignores the endless threats of the 21st century. He should treat the reform initiative as the constitutional minimum required to keep the high-tech dynamo from spinning entirely out of control.CommentsChez PazienzaCo-host, \u0027The Bubble Genius Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027; writer, Deus Ex MalcontentMaybe the tools of quickfire social media outrage really do ensure that the guilty no longer go unpunished for their crimes. But is there a cost for that?CommentsChristine PelosiChair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusWithout voting rights, our struggle for women\u0027s rights, civil rights, LGBT rights, immigrants\u0027 rights and workers\u0027 rights is just a conversation. We know that a handful of voter fraud cases have been used to silence millions of voices and we must change that.Comments (38)Mark MorfordColumnist, SFGate/San Francisco Chronicle; Author, \u0027The Daring Spectacle: Adventures in Deviant Journalism\u0027, ERYT yoga instructorI dive into this venture with an all-consuming fervor, ignoring how I\u0027m no music critic by training and instead opening wide to 30 years of serious music obsessiveness; couple it to a bottle of Casa Nobles while I blithely ignore everyone else\u0027s obvious year-end picks.CommentsJulianna W. Minerwww.rantsfrommommyland.comFriendships end, but more often they ebb and flow, even those that last a lifetime. And not without some heartache along the way.CommentsSusannah LewisFreelance writer, blogger, aspiring best-selling author, wife, momI didn\u0027t want to go to Walmart that day, but I went. I didn\u0027t want to give the lady my kids\u0027 toys, but I did. Sometimes doing what we don\u0027t want to do is exactly what we\u0027re supposed to do.Comments (22)Diane RavitchHistorian, NYU professorWhen I go with my partner to midnight Mass, I am glad I know the words to the songs. I look around and am not surprised to see a fairly large number of other Jews from the neighborhood, also joining in singing the songs with the choir. It is Christmas. It is a time to celebrate peace and joy and goodwill towards all. We can all share those hopes.Comments (48)Doug BandowSenior Fellow, the Cato InstituteI don\u0027t expect very much from Santa Claus these days. I mean, he\u0027s been a disappointment over the years. My desires are few--power, money, and fame, that sort of thing--but he\u0027s yet to satisfy any of them. So I tried downgrading my requests to world peace and the end of international poverty.Comments (53)Conde Nast TravelerCondeNastTraveler.comWe are going to hell for thinking these photos are so funny.CommentsGeoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoAfter examining the evidence provided by the NSA, the Review Group concluded that the information obtained through the section 215 telephony meta-data program had not proved necessary to the prevention of any planned terrorist attack since the program\u0027s inception in 2006.Comments (33)Rev. Kenneth TannerPastor, Holy Redeemer; WriterHow can gratitude for this gift be confined to a day or a season? Every moment -- all our breaths -- ought to resound with praise for this radical identification of God with us.Comments (13)Farai ChideyaMultimedia journalist and authorA lot has been written about interfaith families and how they blend or respect traditions. But you don\u0027t have to be in a relationship to be interfaith. We all grow and evolve. How do we relate to the divine, if we choose not to do it in the way we once did as a child?Comments (12)ViatorTours and activities around the worldSanta Claus, Father Christmas, Papa Noel, Saint Nicholas -- whatever name you want to call the rotund man in the red suit, it\u0027s hard to deny the magnetic charms of everyone\u0027s favorite Christmas character.CommentsBlake KernenA 8th grader from Morristown-Beard School, New JerseyMy younger brother found out that those presents under the tree don\u0027t come from Santa\u0027s workshop; they come from the mall. Shock, disbelief and disappointment quickly set in.CommentsJulie Kuriakose, M.D.Dual board-certified in allergy and immunology and internal medicineSeasonal allergies don\u0027t need to ruin your holiday season. Being prepared and taking precaution can go a long way in the fight against your allergies.CommentsMicah J. MurrayBlogger at RedemptionPictures.comIt\u0027s the same every year, and if I\u0027m completely honest with myself, I\u0027m disappointed. Christmas isn\u0027t going to complete me. It can\u0027t. And it doesn\u0027t have to. I\u0027m learning that this is okay.CommentsLinda BergtholdHealth policy researcherIf you did not sign up for health insurance by Christmas Eve this year, you are not out of luck. You can still get insured. With all the news about the Obamacare website, the deadlines, the delays, you would think that would be clear. But it could not be more confusing.Comments (127)Whitney CaudillAssociate Dean, Manchester University \u0026 Blogger, It is pretty.Needless to say, it is easy to focus on the negatives of being single at the holidays. But the truth is that it isn\u0027t all bad. In fact, I believe there is a strong argument that it is better, or at least more fun, to be single during the holidays.Comments (13)Marilyn SewellUnitarian Univeralist minister, writerEach year my tree, still graced with these gathered, given ornaments, reminds me of the abundance of love in the universe, and challenges me to keep my heart ever open to receive.CommentsJJ VirginFitness/Nutrition Expert, Author of NY Times Bestseller The Virgin Diet.For most of us, optimal mood begins with the right foods. These mood-boosting foods can subtly but powerfully brighten your outlook, reduce stress, and boost feel-good hormones to help you not only cope but thrive during the hectic holiday season and beyond.CommentsToni NagyBlogger, tonibologna.comAs I frantically search Amazon for the perfect Lady Bug costume that isn\u0027t too itchy, has antennas and comes with a tutu (but not a black one, only red), I can\u0027t help but feel conflicted. Gifts are a huge part of the exhilaration children feel at Christmas, but I don\u0027t want it to be limited to that.CommentsLana Gorlinski15-year-old sophomore from Orange County, CaliforniaFor one month, it becomes socially acceptable to be as childish and unapologetically corny as possible. In an age of modernism, it\u0027s refreshing to bask in nonsensical whimsy and tradition.CommentsJana Lee FrazierFormer zookeeper, wildlife biologist and rehabilitatorFor us, the holiday evolved from and revolved around the Christmas tree. But the trip, the many trips, to find the right tree were for my mother only an excuse to shamelessly, obscenely revel in the pure pleasure of nature.CommentsRobert CreamerPolitical Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersOver the last decade the far right, that now dominates the GOP, has conducted a real war on the values that we celebrate at Christmas.Comments (311)Michael HurtPhotographer, ProfessorChristmas is one of the most successfully marketed holidays of the year and also the most lucrative for retailers and a great boost for the consumer economy. For Koreans, it is also the most fun.CommentsMedea Benjamin, 2013.26.12Hope Gainer, 2013.26.12Simon Watson, 2013.26.12Peter \u0027Souleo\u0027 Wright, 2013.26.12David Bergstein, 2013.26.12Diane Propsner, 2013.26.12Noah Greenwald, 2013.26.12Leah Stern, 2013.26.12Jacob Gold, 2013.26.12Jonathan Ezer, 2013.26.12Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"TRAFFIC TROUBLE",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BizYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
