{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027According to accounts in the business press, there is a campaign among Washington insiders to get Larry Summers appointed as Ben Bernanke\u0027s replacement as Federal Reserve Board chair. This could end up being the scariest horror movie of the summer. It is bizarre that Summers would be seriously considered as the next Fed chair if for no other reason than that there is an obvious replacement for Bernanke already sitting at the Fed. Janet Yellen, the vice-chair, has in the past served as the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, a member of the Board of Governors in the 1990s and head of President Clinton\u0027s Council of Economic Advisers. She also has an impressive academic background, having been a professor at both Berkeley and Harvard. No woman has ever served as chair of the Fed, and Yellen would be an obvious choice to break the barrier.Comments (147)Arianna HuffingtonThe idea is to make volunteering a first-level option for families when they\u0027re deciding what to do -- right in the mix with movies, going out to eat, playdates, soccer, and Little League. In other words, a normal part of American family life.Comments (93)Kirk DouglasActorSex may fade, but love... love lasts.

KelleyAuthor, \u0027Africa Speaks, America Answers: Modern Jazz in Revolutionary Times\u0027Where was the NRA on Trayvon Martin\u0027s right to stand his ground? What happened to their principled position? Let\u0027s be clear: the Trayvon Martins of the world never had that right because the \"ground\" was never considered theirs to stand on.Comments (368)Paul AbramsLast person on Earth not on FacebookSo, if a party really wants to win the \u002714 elections so that they can get the unemployment rates down to ~4 percent, they will prove it to voters by agreeing upfront to a shared sacrifice. How does one do that? Simple. Peg congressional salaries to the unemployment rate.Comments (14)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027Death is horrible enough. But systematic injustice -- one that allows white boys to assume success, yet leads black boys to cower from the very institutions created to protect our own wellbeing -- is a travesty.Comments (983)Kino MacGregorInternational Yoga Teacher, AuthorYoga is more than just stretching and relaxation.

I am a middle-aged, middle class, overweight white guy. I am also a teacher, and in 20 years of teaching, I have seen plenty of Trayvon Martins.

LearsyAuthor, \u0027Oil and Finance: The Epic Corruption Continues\u0027In the face of escalating gas prices, the oil patch, their allies and Wall Street are counting on your ignorance permitting them to pick your pockets, spoon-feeding you nonsense while they cash in massively.Comments (39)Blake KernenA 7th grader from Morristown-Beard School, New JerseyHere\u0027s a presidential proclamation that I\u0027m clearly in support of. Ronald Reagan, the 40th president of the United States, had the incredible foresight, and perhaps sweet tooth, to proclaim that July would be National Ice Cream Month.CommentsLindsay GoldsteinStudent, blogger, cancer survivorWhen you\u0027re sick, you look for motivation to keep going and fight on anywhere you can find it. I \"liked\" so many Facebook pages, wrote emails, and read about the progress of other kids who had to go through what I did. And no story inspired me more than that of Talia Castellano.CommentsMargie OmeroDemocratic pollster \u0026 strategistTo listen to Republicans and Republican-watchers talk about immigration, one would think the debate is about balancing Latinos and whites in a zero sum game of electoral politics. There is nothing in the polling to back this up.Comments (15)Evan HandlerActor, author, screenwriter, and journalistWhat do I think about Trayvon Martin\u0027s death? I think the people who passed the laws, as they stand in Florida, made his death inevitable. If not his, certainly someone else\u0027s.Comments (350)Russell SimmonsFounder, GlobalGrind.comWhen our laws ill-affect one community much more then another they must be challenged. I join the Trayvon Martin Foundation in their fight to end every law in America that creates the environment for a tragedy like to this to ever happen again.Comments (331)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistThis past weekend, something pretty amazing -- and very telling -- happened in the film industry. The much anticipated \"Lone Ranger\" tanked at the box office, joining \"After Earth\" and \"White House Down\" as the third mega-budget bomb of the summer. Meanwhile, \"The Heat,\" starring Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy, has already earned double its budget.CommentsSteven ConnAuthor/Professor, Ohio StateClearly, the nation needs a farm bill, but just as clearly it needs to have different priorities than simply subsidizing corporate farms to produce cheap crops and factory-raised chickens.

The message about concussion awareness is getting through to school-based coached sports like football, but if there\u0027s no coach around, how do you know how to tell whether or not to go see a doctor?CommentsCaron GremontFounder, First Bites, firstbites.orgThere are always other barriers to making a change such as limited storage space, lack of time to cut food, budget constraints or teachers who find cookies and chips effective rewards in the classroom. Accept that these are barriers -- and work with the school to creatively find solutions.Comments (11)Carole Brody FleetSpeaker and Award-Winning Author, \"Happily Even After…\" and \"Widows Wear Stilettos…\"A few months ago, a well-known actor mentioned in an interview that he still thinks about his late wife. People were shocked at this \u0027stunning revelation\u0027, as the same actor has been happily remarried for a number of years. This sort of \u0027shocked\u0027 reaction begs an obvious question. Since when did remarriage become an equation formula that reads: Remarried \u003d Forgetting?Comments (12)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkIf we allow the killing of an unarmed Black teenager to be turned into some sort of circus where the responsible party blames the victim, then we have reached the height of absurdity.
