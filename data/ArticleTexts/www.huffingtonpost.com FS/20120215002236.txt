{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Did you hear the news? Apparently the 2012 election isn\u0027t going to be about the economy after all. Instead, in the words of an AP headline, \"Social Issues Retake U.S. Politics, 2012 Elections.\" The catalyst for this reorientation of the election was the rule announced by the Obama administration that employers must provide free coverage in their health insurance plans for contraception. This, we\u0027re told, provoked a \"firestorm\" across the political landscape, as pundits across the ideological spectrum warned the White House of pending disaster if it continued to pursue such a divisive, controversial and incendiary path. President Obama\u0027s entire reelection effort was now in jeopardy -- if not already hopelessly lost -- due to Birth Contracalypse 2012. To which I say, Seriously? This supposed \"culture war\" may have captured the fevered imagination of the press corps, but not the electorate -- 71 percent of which still says the economy is the most important problem facing America.Read Post | Comments (541)Russell Simmons, 2/14/12Founder, GlobalGrind.comPresident Obama made the right decision several days ago that he was not going to let those who want to take the nation backward outspend him for the attention and public mindset of millions of people who will be influenced by super PACs.Read Post | Comments (33)Bill Moyers and Michael Winship, 2/14/12Our elections have replaced horse racing as the sport of kings. Only these kings are multi-billionaire, corporate moguls who by the divine right, not of God, but the United States Supreme Court and its Citizens United decision, are now buying politicians like so much pricey horseflesh.Read Post | Comments (59)Gov. Chris Gregoire, 2/14/12Governor of WashingtonIn my seven-year tenure as governor of the great state of Washington, yesterday was one of the best. That\u0027s when I signed the bill providing marriage equality for all Washingtonians, and it is the day when our state said, quite simply, that love is love.Read Post | Comments (25)Noam Chomsky, 2/14/12Institute Professor emeritus, MIT Department of Linguistics and PhilosophyAmerican decline is real, though the apocalyptic vision reflects the familiar ruling class perception that anything short of total control amounts to total disaster.Read Post | Comments (172)Alexis Glick, 2/14/12CEO, GENYOUth FoundationThere\u0027s a cacophony of debate about how children should be taught, tested, and measured to ensure their academic success. That\u0027s fine, but overwhelmingly, the country\u0027s youth is failing to get the physical activity or proper nutrition it needs to be healthy and perform academically.Read Post | CommentsJeff Madrick, 2/14/12Roosevelt Institute Senior Fellow; author, \u0027Age of Greed\u0027With this budget, Obama shows there are some grounds for optimism at last. But it is also a reminder of how much farther there is to go.Read Post | CommentsJohn Farr, 2/14/12Editor, bestmoviesbyfarr.comOne thing this past year confirmed was that these handsome, movie-idol personalities can really act. Too often Pitt and Clooney have been constrained by their leading man status to playing cool protagonists who save the day and get the girl. And they appear to be playing themselves.Read Post | Comments (24)Danielle Crittenden, 2/14/12Managing Editor, Blogs, The Huffington Post CanadaThe reason I dread and fear Valentine\u0027s Day is because, despite being a happily married woman for nearly a quarter-century, my husband has loathed the holiday from the beginning. Why you ask? Why, if your husband is happily married too, would he not wish to express that happiness?Read Post | CommentsSen. Jeff Merkley, 2/14/12U.S. Senator from OregonPut simply, the Volcker Rule takes deposit-taking, loan-making banks out of the business of high-risk, conflict-ridden trading -- leaving that to the hedge funds, if they choose to do it.Read Post | CommentsNathan Newman, 2/14/12Founder, Tech-Progress.orgSeeing rich business analysts bemoaning workers making probably a fifth to a tenth of the income they take home each year is nauseating, but it\u0027s worth asking how we got to the point that it is a bit \"shocking\" in some sense that workers in what is seen as a low-wage industry are making a living wage?Read Post | CommentsChez Pazienza, 2/14/12Co-host, \"The Bubble Genius Bob \u0026 Chez Show\"; Writer, Deus Ex MalcontentCNN, you have to fire Nancy Grace.

You might instead, go to church. The power of community to create health is far greater than any physician, clinic or hospital.Read Post | Comments (27)Rev. Jesse Jackson, 2/14/12Civil rights activistThe federal health care plan for legislators is a pretty nice deal, with the federal government offering a broad array of plans.
