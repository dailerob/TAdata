{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Starting today, we are welcoming bloggers to Patch.com, AOL\u0027s national network of hyperlocal sites currently covering community life in over 800 towns across America. Our new Local Voices group blog will complement Patch\u0027s original reporting, allowing members of each community to speak up and speak out to their neighbors -- whether they\u0027re across town, a block away or two doors down. Local Voices reflects our belief that community residents feel deeply about their local issues, and deserve the chance to share their thoughts on issues great and small. As a forum for thriving conversation, Local Voices will connect all members of the community -- be it the mayor, a school principal, a businessperson or a member of your family.Read Post | CommentsMalou Innocent, 05.04.2011Foreign Policy Analyst, Cato InstitutePakistan wants to have its cake and eat it too, much like a cheating spouse. There seems to be more and more evidence, however, that it is worthwhile for America to file for divorce.Read Post | CommentsSimon Johnson, 05.04.2011MIT Professor and co-author of 13 BankersA proper Senate confirmation hearing for Elizabeth Warren would allow her to explain in clear terms how \"too big to fail\" banks are are now involved in a hugely dangerous government subsidy scheme that presents a serious, nontransparent threat to consumers.Read Post | CommentsDennis A. Henigan, 05.04.2011Brady Center Vice President and Author of \"Lethal Logic\"The NRA needs average Americans to believe that the threat of attack is constant and pervasive. It\u0027s not enough to have a gun in the home for self-defense; you need multiple guns throughout your home so you\u0027re never too far from your gun.Read Post | CommentsKathleen Reardon, 05.04.2011Professor, USC Marshall School; author of The Secret Handshake and Comebacks At WorkPresident Obama tends not to get out in front of image problems. In fact, his analytical leadership style inclines him toward quite the opposite. His response to the birthers and their latest ringleader Donald Trump is a case in point.Read Post | CommentsJudith J. Wurtman, PhD, 05.04.2011Co-author, \"The Serotonin Power Diet, Eat Carbs, Nature\u0027s Own Appetite Suppressant, to Stop Emotional Overeating\"A study conducted last Fall revealed that a year after liposuction removed fat, it came back. And horrors of horrors, it reappeared mostly in the upper abdomen, shoulders and triceps (the back of the arms).Read Post | CommentsMichelle Rhee, 05.04.2011Founder and CEO of StudentsFirstMost teachers are evaluated inconsistently, going without the feedback and professional development that can help them excel. The need for change is basic and glaring. We need new evaluation systems that can strengthen the profession.Read Post | CommentsArie Kruglanski, 05.04.2011Investigator, National Center for the Study of Terrorism and the Response to Terrorism, University of MarylandThe long awaited demise of Osama bin Laden is a crowning accomplishment in the global struggle against terror. Operational, inspirational and motivational consequences are likely to unfold.Read Post | CommentsRoger Martin, 05.04.2011Author, \u0027Fixing the Game\u0027Modern capitalism dictates that CEOs always be working to increase the stock price, to raise expectations about the company\u0027s prospects ad infinitum. And just how does that play out? The NFL actually has the answers.Read Post | CommentsRep. Carolyn Maloney, 05.04.2011Congresswoman from New YorkCongress has created the CFPB with so much oversight that calls for \"improving\" the CFPB are unfair to all of us who use financial services. These bills are transparent attempts to hobble the agency before it has even opened its doors.Read Post | CommentsUna LaMarche, 05.04.2011Editor of \u0027The Sassy Curmudgeon\u0027Can I just say that this show\u0027s cold opens are funnier than The Office\u0027s? This week the two-minute mini-drama centers on a sad pair of \"pregnancy suspenders.\" \"I guess they\u0027re to hold up your pants?\" Hannah mumbles. Oh, honey.Read Post | CommentsDylan Ratigan, 05.04.2011Host of MSNBC\u0027s “The Dylan Ratigan Show”People remember him with a bullhorn on top of rubble, but President George W. Bush also gave a clarion call for action. He told us to \"go shopping.\" That was his moment, and that was his prescription for America. Now Barack Obama has his moment. What will he use it for?Read Post | CommentsImam Feisal Abdul Rauf, 05.04.2011Chairman, Cordoba InitiativeAs our president reminded us, bin Laden did not represent Islam. The Quran explicitly states that no soul shall be responsible for the sins of another. Terrorism, which targets innocents who had no part in a crime, fundamentally violates this Quranic commandment.Read Post | CommentsRep. Bruce Braley, 05.04.2011U.S. Representative from Iowa’s 1st DistrictHouse Resolution 3 represents an unprecedented rollback of women\u0027s rights by sneaking in a backdoor provision to reintroduce language that redefines rape. It would be a laughable concept if it weren\u0027t so serious.Read Post | CommentsWes Moore, 05.04.2011Youth advocate, Army combat veteran, Business leader, and AuthorI was among those cheering as word spread that Osama bin Laden was dead, but as we inch closer to a decision to release the photos of his dead body, I cannot say I share the same joy.Read Post | CommentsRev. Jennifer Butler, 05.04.2011Executive Director, Faith in Public LifeThe truth is that H.R. 3 breaks sharply with longstanding federal abortion policy in ways that could significantly impact people\u0027s health insurance and set a precedent that jeopardizes funding for many faith-based organizations.Read Post | CommentsDan Collins, 05.04.2011New York Editor-At-Large of The Huffington PostNearly ten years after terrorists smashed planes into Lower Manhattan, the most optimistic thing you can say about the rebuilding of the World Trade Center is that it\u0027s a work in progress.Read Post | CommentsDavid Katz, M.D., 05.04.2011Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterAs a frequent flier, I wince at every story of an inattentive air traffic controller. A parallel dilemma related to the working hours of medical residents is playing out at lower altitudes.Read Post | CommentsJoe Cirincione, 05.04.2011President, Ploughshares FundThere\u0027s one less threat to America this week, but there are 21,000 others waiting to explode. That\u0027s the number of nuclear weapons in the U.S. and Russia.Read Post | CommentsScott Mendelson, 05.04.2011Film CriticDespite Marvel and Paramount\u0027s best marketing efforts to convince otherwise, Kenneth Branagh\u0027s Thor is a perfectly satisfactory piece of popcorn entertainment.Read Post | CommentsTommy G. Thompson, 05.04.2011Former Gov. of Wisconsin and Sec. of the Department of Health and Human ServiceInstead of focusing on broad cuts to Medicare spending, lawmakers should get to the root of the problem and fix the underlying payment system. One model for fixing this problem is already at work in California.Read Post | CommentsDan Carol and Morley Winograd, 05.04.2011While it\u0027s good that we are focused on streamlining how big federal agencies can more effectively deliver outcomes, let\u0027s not forget that the biggest bang for the buck may come from moving the buck from D.C. to community-led growth.Read Post | CommentsYusra Tekbali, 05.03.2011As a Libyan and Muslim woman, my voice is often drowned out. But the revolutions of the Arab Spring thrust women into the public sphere and supported their voices with megaphones.Read Post | CommentsClarence B. Jones, 05.04.2011Scholar in Residence, Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute at Stanford UniversityWhy can\u0027t the same thoughtful and courageous presidential leadership we witnessed on bin Laden be exercised in confronting our continued high rate of joblessness and the budget deficit?Read Post | CommentsMarshall Fine, 05.04.2011Author and film critic, hollywoodandfine.comReally -- once you had the title and the trailer, why mess with perfection? The brilliance of Hobo with a Shotgun begins and ends with its title and its casting.Read Post | CommentsPaul Carr, 05.04.2011British author, columnist, hotel-dwellerWith budgets cut to the bone, many museums are falling under, and many schools can\u0027t afford such fripperies as museum field trips. I don\u0027t know why the loss of a Liberace museum would make me sad, but it does.Read Post | CommentsM.
