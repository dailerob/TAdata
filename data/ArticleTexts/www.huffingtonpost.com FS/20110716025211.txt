{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Fellow, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesI deeply fear the wholly and easily avoidable consequences of failing to raise the debt ceiling. I\u0027ve not even entertained the possibility because I can\u0027t believe that elected officials could so dramatically abrogate their responsibilities. And I still don\u0027t think we\u0027ll default. But let\u0027s get real here. You cannot negotiate with people who refuse to do so. And with their demands, the Republicans are refusing to do so.

We\u0027re all ears.Read Post | CommentsDon Bonker, 7/15/11Executive Vice President, APCO Worldwide; Fmr. Congressman from Washington\u0027s 3rd DistrictWhen Congress puts political demagogy ahead of the national well-being, there can be serious consequences. If you need evidence of this, look no further than the Great Depression.Read Post | CommentsRocky Kistner, 7/15/11Media associate, NRDCA year later along the gulf coast, locals know the oil is not gone.

Congressional Republicans, now led by House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, hate government so much they\u0027re ready to sacrifice the full faith and credit of the United States in order to shrink it.Read Post | CommentsMarian Wright Edelman, 7/15/11President, Children\u0027s Defense FundAs the president and Congress struggle to find a way to lower the budget deficit and to raise the debt ceiling before we default on our debt for the first time in history, I hope they will stay away from further cuts in essential food, health, education, and other supports children need.Read Post | CommentsPaul Carr, 7/15/11British author, columnist, hotel-dwellerI\u0027ve become a reluctant expert in the annoying habits of even the fanciest hotels and I figured this was as good a time as any to share them.Read Post | CommentsBrendan Nyhan, 7/15/11Political scientist and media criticOver the years, people have come up with lots of stories about why the president won\u0027t get credit for a good economy or why the opposition will be blamed for a bad economy, but things rarely work out that way.Read Post | CommentsJeffrey Small, 7/15/11Author, \u0027The Breath of God\u0027Reading Biblical stories as mythology gives me the freedom to understand their underlying meaning in a way I never did when I was taught as a child that these stories were factually true.Read Post | CommentsDaphne Eviatar, 7/15/11Senior Associate, Human Rights First’s Law and Security ProgramWhile some secrecy is obviously necessary in the conduct of a war, the U.S. government\u0027s extreme secrecy about its detention of thousands of Afghans without charge or trial at the U.S.-run Bagram Air Base is actually creating a threat to U.S. troops, not alleviating one.Read Post | CommentsIan R. MacDonald and John Amos, 7/15/11The oil in the gulf has devastated the livelihoods of many Gulf residents in a way that no BP lucre could repay. But something else had been dealt a deadly blow, something just as difficult to restore as damaged ecology and economic well-being: trust.Read Post | CommentsDennis A. Henigan, 7/15/11Brady Campaign Acting President and Author of \u0027Lethal Logic\u0027The Obama administration has taken a modest, though useful, step toward curbing the torrent of assault rifles flowing from U.S. gun shops into the hands of the Mexican drug cartels. Hopefully, it reflects a new willingness by the president to take on the gun lobby.Read Post | CommentsMatthew TK Taylor, 7/15/11Technology journalist and linguistics studentGoogle+ has a unique opportunity to take control of real-time social, and unless Twitter gets their act together, it could change how we communicate and dominate the market.Read Post | CommentsWill Braun, 7/15/11Former Editor, Geez MagazineFor 23 years, the News Corp family has included the leading seller of the best-selling book in history.
