{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Author, \u0027Dangerous Ground\u0027America\u0027s decade-long experience in the post-9/11 Middle East has conditioned the American public, and by extension the American body politic, to embrace hyperbole and sensationalism over fact and nuance. In doing so, decisions are being made which do not reflect reality, and as such not only fail to rectify the situation at hand, but more often than not, exacerbate it. America\u0027s experience with Iran stands as a clear case in point, where analysts have failed to accurately depict the true nature of Iran\u0027s military capability, among other issues, and policy makers have, as a result, failed to formulate policies which deal with the issues arising from decades of American-Iranian animosity fueled by post-9/11 emotions, which continue to run high to this day. Getting it wrong on Iran has become an American institution, one which may have far-reaching detrimental consequences.How does it feel to be a threat? How does it feel to know that your life is less valued? How does it feel to know that there are people in your midst who feel and are more privileged than you by the accident of phenotype?SOBA Presidential Professor in the Political Science Department of Johns HopkinsWhat any sensible Congress should be doing -- and what any sensible elite would be demanding -- is making the tax code more, not less progressive. Estate taxes should be higher; the various loopholes and dodges to escape them should be eliminated.President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureGood girls who question become bad girls. Heck, good girls who don\u0027t question are always on the edge of being considered bad girls anyway. The goodness of a girl is devastatingly fragile. So, instead, my education took place in secret.Actor, comedian, and speaker for high schools and colleges through Campus Outreach ServicesVideo or no video, prompt investigation and appropriate action following a police shooting -- just as with any possible crime -- should be the rule nationwide, not the exception. But these incidents are more than just bad-apple cops: The problem of unjustified lethal force is endemic.Director, ACLU\u0027s Criminal Law Reform ProjectIt hasn\u0027t gotten a lot of attention outside Wisconsin, but if you want to see what a President Scott Walker might try to do to an independent federal judiciary, check out what Governor Scott Walker is doing to the Wisconsin judiciary -- including through a crucial referendum vote Tuesday.President, Alliance for JusticeLast month the IRS issued a warning that received scant attention from the media but nonetheless could impact millions of taxpayers this year -- particularly low-income, elderly and Spanish-speaking taxpayers. The scam takes advantage of the Individual Shared Responsibility Provision of the Affordable Care Act.Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911We don\u0027t know how to control super-intelligent machines. How long until a thinking machine -- a smart killer robot, for example -- learns to program itself?Author, Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human EraFacebook regularly turns me into a jealous mess. Everyone in my network seems to have either a book deal, an award or an article in the New Yorker (I currently have none of those things). It\u0027s tempting to prescribe self-help to the envious. But that advice is misguided. The cure for the social media blues is honesty.Blogs Editor, Huffington Post CanadaIt\u0027s time for a confession. I have worked as a \"foreign agent.\"Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogIt\u0027s time for diplomacy\u0027s critics to stop blaming the negotiations\u0027 supporters for bringing up the possibility of war. Now that the heavyweights of the neoconservative world have all weighed in on \"a few days\" of military strikes on Iran, does anybody doubt what Plan B looks like?Executive Director, Peace Action WestWith all of this talk of privatization ramping up, now is the time for Hillary Clinton and other Democrats to knock the idea down. Veterans will be watching.Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranIn the recent past, events like the grotesque Delhi rape case and the tremendous outpouring that followed it have cast a giant spotlight on the rampant sexism evident in South Asia. However Purvi Patel\u0027s fate makes it clear that women\u0027s rights over their bodies and their sexualities are also policed and threatened in parts of America.Author, Island of a Thousand MirrorsPresident Obama has called charter schools \"incubators of innovation\" and \"laboratories of innovation,\" and he has done so for several years, despite the fact that, so far, the laboratories have yielded nothing.Teacher and writer; blogger, curmudgucation.blogspot.comEven the seemingly most abstruse points of Jewish dietary laws and practices have been debated for hundreds of years. Although non-Orthodox myself, I hoped I\u0027d been careful to ensure that each recipe met the standards of Kashrut.Creative Director and CEO, Fig Tree \u0026 VineReading serious letters sent by citizens might induce presidents to send out thoughtful responses in the form of public feelers for fresh approaches, recommendations, or timely alerts about important matters.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorDon\u0027t say you were not warned. If you go down the road of watch notifications, you will become a #watchhole and alienate everyone around you.EntrepreneurWhat if, with just one small change, we could give families an earlier estimate of college costs and alleviate some of the administrative burden on schools? It\u0027s possible -- and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan has the authority to enact it today.President and CEO, National Association of Student Financial Aid AdministratorsFinally, to the chagrin of Tom Cotton and Israel hawks, and the delight of Iranians, who reportedly launched firecrackers into the Tehran sky last week, a deal on Iran\u0027s controversial nuclear program has emerged. I for one am relieved.Author, Off the Radar: A Father’s Secret, A Mother’s Heroism, and A Son’s QuestDeepak Chopra is so on the fringe, it\u0027s actually fun to read him usually -- picture me with tears in my eyes, emitting cackles like Mozart\u0027s braying laugh in Amadeus. But when he goes after evolution, it starts to feel personal -- and less amusing.Programs and Policy Director for the National Center for Science EducationRecently I was ready to get out of my comfort zone and break out of my shell. Yet in the end, I found it rather lonely and paradoxically dependent on Wi-Fi.A romantic with hopes of inspiring others to believe in love and in themselves. Blogger and founder of www.singlestrides.comNo matter where you are on the road to fulfillment, life gets messy. Milk cartons tip over. Businesses fail. Fender benders happen. Friends disappoint you. Messes, big and small, are inevitable. However, in any moment, you have a choice. You can meet challenges as the narrow perception of personality or as the infinite expansiveness of spirit.Contemporary thought leader and spiritual teacherNever, ever ask a woman if she is pregnant. Old people have lots and lots of good stuff to say. \"I\u0027m sorry. I made a mistake. I won\u0027t do that again,\" is always the best first response to any trouble you may be in.AuthorA civilian war leader conferring with uniformed military leaders. The president of the world\u0027s fifth-largest power, a member of the United Nations Security Council, listening intently to the generals of a great nation that is not yet a state, offering encouragement, promising France\u0027s redoubled support. It is a weighty and potentially decisive moment.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.MOOIs (Massive Open Online Interventions) are mental health and substance abuse interventions, scientifically validated and available online to unlimited numbers of consumers. As with MOOCs, most of these consumers can be expected to drop out, but some will stay -- and get well.Author, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027Last year, I challenged the Koch brothers to meet me for a debate so that we could have an open, transparent exchange of ideas. Unfortunately, they refused, so I\u0027m about to give them another chance. I am formally inviting the Kochs -- again -- to participate in a public debate.California Philanthropist \u0026 Climate ChampionLike a pot of pork bones, ramen\u0027s popularity has been simmering for a long time.Everything worth caring about in food, drink, and travelOn March 31, 2014, two young men suddenly appeared in a dark alley in Pittsburgh. Their subsequent encounter with my partner, Allen, changed our lives forever. It turns out Pittsburgh is a pretty good place to have a massive heart attack. But for these two strangers, Allen would undoubtedly have died that night.Professor of Law, Director CUNY Center for Urban Environmental ReformRoosevelt understood that people who feel they have an economic future and a sense of stability are more able to spend money and participate in our consumer-driven economy. That means more business and more profits for companies selling all sorts of goods and services. Sooner or later, even the CEOs benefit. Call it \"trickle-up\" economics.Chief Operating Officer, The Greenlining InstituteJamaica has become a terrible example of what can happen when creditors, led by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), are able to impose harsh austerity on a trapped nation in an attempt to collect on an uncollectable debt. Since the U.S. Treasury Department decides what the IMF does in the Western Hemisphere, Obama himself can claim responsibility for this failure.Co-director, Center for Economic and Policy Research, Washington, D.C.One of the most innovative reforms in the country is one you\u0027ve probably never heard of. That\u0027s about to change, because Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) is transforming the national discussion about how to end the war on drugs and mass incarceration.Managing Director, Policy \u0026 Campaigns, Drug Policy AllianceGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"NOW HE WANTS STIMULUS",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
