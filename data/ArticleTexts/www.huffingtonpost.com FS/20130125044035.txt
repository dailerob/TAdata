{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, politicians, writers, activists and nonprofit leaders are gathered in Davos, Switzerland for the 43rd annual meeting of the World Economic Forum. While the issues to be addressed range from healthcare to regulation to the environment, the two of us share an interest in one particular topic -- economic growth and job creation. The Huffington Post and Goldman Sachs come at this issue with different perspectives, but a common goal. So today, our two organizations are joining forces to examine what entrepreneurs are doing to drive growth around the world and apply the lessons we have learned. Based on the experience of Goldman Sachs\u0027 10,000 Women initiative and HuffPost\u0027s commitment to showcasing \"What Is Working,\" we are appearing together today in Davos to open up the conversation about helping to build a global economy that not only grows but also provides much greater opportunities and prosperity to women and men alike.Read Post | Comments (202)Bob Cesca, 01/24/13Political Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowThe whole notion of an armed revolt and secession from the United States failed miserably in 1865, and the revolutionaries at that time were headed by skilled West Point commanders like J.E.B.

Andrea Bocelli was working as a lawyer in Italy when he was discovered. Harrison Ford worked for years as a carpenter before getting his big break.

Just like that. No protracted national culture-war debate, no threats by conservatives to block progress -- in other words, nothing like the fight the nation saw over letting gays serve openly.Read Post | Comments (14)Joseph A.
