She spoke of ordinary voters as if they were a species apart, and showed interest only in the political usefulness of their choices.Read Post | Comments (577)BIOJoe Lockhart, 04.18.2008Climate legislation presents probably the last best chance for Democrats to score a legislative win and prove their return to majority a success.Read Post | Comments (19)BIOKevin Phillips, 04.15.2008The inevitable chimera of economic collectivization is coming undone. Will ordinary Americans pay much of the price? Almost certainly. Should they blame what happens on marketplace forces? No.Read Post | Comments (181)BIODavid Weiner, 04.14.2008It seems that Cindy McCain, John McCain\u0027s perfect, blonde beer-baroness wife is about to find herself painted as the latest example of plagiarism on the campaign trail.Read Post | Comments (710)BIOMarylee Smithwick, 04.18.2008\"Bitter\" is a good word, to describe some of what I feel -- but \"mad as hell\" are a few better words. And I have a son that is on his way to Iraq for his third or forth tour, so I am not only mad but scared.Read Post | Comments (145)BIODavid Coleman, 04.14.2008No good effort at intelligent analysis, candor -- and what I heard as an attempt to convey a profound understanding of both what people feel and why they feel it -- goes unpunished.Read Post | Comments (896)Harry Shearer, 04.13.2008Marc Cooper, 04.16.2008Chez Pazienza, 04.15.2008Mary Mapes, 04.17.2008Tim Robbins, 04.15.2008Bob Cesca, 04.17.2008Steven Weber, 04.18.2008Greg Mitchell, 04.19.2008Bonnie Fuller, 04.16.2008Jane Hamsher, 04.18.2008Jason Linkins, 04.17.2008Robert Shrum, 04.13.2008Paul Loeb, 04.16.2008John Lundberg, 04.20.2008Nancy H.
