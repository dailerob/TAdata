{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027The only way to win the War on Poverty is for liberals and conservatives to make peace -- for the sake of the poor. That would be the best way to mark the 50th anniversary of the War on Poverty, declared by President Lyndon Johnson in his January 1964 State of the Union address. Making peace means replacing ideologies with solutions that actually solve the problems of poverty. With both Republicans and Democrats speaking out on poverty this week, and the recession slowly receding this should be an opportunity to find the focus, commitment, and strategies that could effectively reduce and ultimately eliminate the shameful facts of poverty in the world\u0027s richest nation. On this 50th anniversary of a historic commitment, it\u0027s time for both political parties to be more self-critical and more open to new possibilities, instead of just blaming the other side -- or vilifying poor people themselves.Comments (73)TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"What if the best way to help kids learn is to stop trying so hard to keep them safe? Hear popular TED speaker Gever Tulley\u0027s radical argument for letting kids play with power tools and other things that will make parents squirm.Comments (18)Lawrence LessigAuthor, \u0027Republic, Lost\u0027; Founder, RootstrikersI wanted to find a way to mark this day. I wanted to feel it, as physically painful as it was emotionally painful one year ago, and every moment since. So I am marking it with the cause that he convinced me to take up seven years ago and which I am certain he wanted to make his legacy too.CommentsRobert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, Beyond OutrageThe U.S. economy created a measly 74,000 new jobs in December, and a smaller percentage of working-age Americans are now employed than at any time in the last three decades (before women surged into the workforce).Comments (63)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundCharging children and youths as adults and incarcerating them with adults is the opposite of an effective intervention that helps young people turn their lives around and decreases crime. It makes our communities less safe.CommentsGordon BrownFormer Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationBy standing up to a terrorist, this extraordinary boy saved countless lives and should join the ranks of those whose actions define the word courage. This teenager thought his school important enough to defend and he had an instinctive sense that if the militants were allowed to destroy his school, they were taking away something valuable from his community.CommentsRandi WeingartenPresident, American Federation of TeachersWill the powers-that-be continue to be more concerned with creating a testing and data system that ranks and sorts schools and educators, in the quest for the perfect industrial algorithm to judge teachers, students and schools? Or will they look at the evidence and join educators, students and parents in fighting to reclaim the promise of public education?CommentsKirk DouglasActorPope Francis is a man who wants us to understand each other no matter what our differences may be and to do our best to help one another. And that is the core of what every religion should be.Comments (43)Doug BandowSenior Fellow, the Cato InstituteNorth Korea is a great human tragedy. And we should hope that the next informal ambassador to the DPRK is someone less prone to inane outbursts. Nevertheless, Dennis Rodman is better than nothing.CommentsMichael S. Broder, Ph.D.Psychologist; Author, \u0027Stage Climbing: The Shortest Path to Your Highest Potential\u0027Then comes what for most parents is the hard part - letting go and trusting that they will learn from their own mistakes, passions, uniqueness and psychological growing pains.CommentsRichard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future\"Different\"? Christie embodies his party perfectly. Arrogant? Check. Bullying? Check. Indifferent to the well-being of constituents? Check. He may sound like a different kind of Republican, but he governs the same way the others do. Meet the new GOP, same as the old GOP.Comments (124)Frances BeineckePresident, Natural Resources Defense CouncilStriking a balance between wildlife conservation and wind energy development starts with understanding threats to eagle populations, and how our actions, including operating wind farms, are affecting them.Comments (33)Arianna HuffingtonBy bringing together people who work in a range of fields -- from media, health care and technology to music, fashion and poetry -- we want to open up the conversation around our need to redefine success.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorPayrolls were up only 74,000 last month, the lowest job gain since January 2011 and suggestive evidence that the broader economic recovery has yet to reach the all-important job market.CommentsDr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholar-Ish is, no doubt, convenient, the drive-thru of adjectives. I\u0027ll give it that. But, like a steady diet of fast food, -ish, not used in moderation, will catch up to you.CommentsGeoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoIn my judgment the existing metadata program is unconstitutional. As currently structured, it violates the Fourth Amendment\u0027s requirement of \"reasonableness.\" On the other hand, it should be possible for the government to correct the deficiencies in the program in a manner that both preserves its legitimate value and substantially mitigates the risks to privacy that it currently poses.Comments (13)Claire McCarthy, M.D.Pediatrician, Boston Children\u0027s Hospital, Harvard Medical SchoolThere were lots of moments when I wished someone were there to help me. But because there wasn\u0027t, I learned resourcefulness. I learned self-reliance. I learned that if I stayed calm and used my head, I could find my way through just about anything. These are lessons I carry with me to this day--and that have served me very well.CommentsTavis SmileyPBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorAmong my guests was Greg Kaufmann, who writes about poverty for The Nation magazine. In the clip below, he shares his views about whether -- 50 years after President Lyndon B. Johnson declared War on Poverty -- there is anything President Obama can do to further the cause.CommentsRep. Chellie PingreeCongresswoman (D-ME)Earlier this week, John Boehner said he would only bring an extension of benefits to a vote under two conditions: spending cuts to pay for them and \"provisions ... to get our economy moving again and put Americans back to work.\" Sadly, the first condition is par for the course. But it\u0027s the second condition that really gets me.CommentsEric BoehlertSenior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaChristie\u0027s coverage has been a long-running, and rather extreme, case of personality trumping substance. But now the bridge bombshell casts all of that flattering coverage into question.Comments (48)Ambassador Gianna AngelopoulosConvening Sponsor, Clinton Global InitiativeThere are 26 million young people in the developed world who are not currently employed, in school or in training programs, according to the OECD. Forget losing weight or exercising more: Our most important resolution for 2014 needs to be solving the youth unemployment crisis.CommentsSen. Richard BlumenthalU.S. Senator from ConnecticutCreated with the intent of making the league sustainable, blackout policies today punish fans rather than encouraging attendance. With the average NFL ticket costing about $80, many fans who have not recovered from the recession simply cannot afford to attend. It is time to improve the deal for fans.Comments (11)Carly PaulLiving in ColoradoThis is how I came to be in poverty\u0027s grip. It was not overnight, and it was not all because of me, and not all because a system that failed me, and not all because of a dysfunctional family, and not all because of overblown capitalism, and not all because of any one thing.Comments (257)Lance BassSinger, actor, producer, writer, entrepreneur and philanthropistFor my family, they still live in ground zero of intolerance for the LGBT community and have the unique pressure of having a well known gay relative. When I came out, they came out.Comments (270)Wray HerbertAuthor, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027What do dishonesty and wit have in common, that they so readily occupy the same mind? Does creativity lead to unethical behavior, or do cheating and lying spur the imagination? Is creativity just a socially acceptable form of violating norms and breaking the rules?CommentsValerie Stivers-IsakovaReviewer, An Anthology of CloudsI\u0027ve been thinking a lot lately about being mean in book reviews, or rather, how to strike a balance between honest and being fair, and if meaningful critique is worth doing in a small book-reviewing world where the de facto style seems to be politeness, encouragement and praise.CommentsDr. Jim TaylorAdjunct faculty, University of San FranciscoParadoxically, in parents\u0027 well-intentioned attempts at protecting their children from harm, they actually leave them less prepared for the real dangers that your kids will face later in life. Exposure to what are for them risky experiences can build confidence, resilience, competence, respect, and responsibility.CommentsDan GolemanAuthor, \u0027Focus: The Hidden Driver of Excellence\u0027How teens navigate these years has real consequences for how they live the rest of lives. While there are always risks and downsides, the teen mind has unique positive qualities.CommentsRob ReinaldaWriter, 28 years in print journalismAs a professional writer/editor and a veteran actor, I\u0027d like to offer what I feel might be more accurate interpretations -- based on their syntax -- of what Chris Christie\u0027s two sentences actually meant, instead of simply buying into their verbal cloaks.CommentsMartha BurkMoney Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsLove it or hate it, we\u0027re in a brand new election year. What with the lowest rating for Congress in history and the gridlock on Capitol Hill, this may seem like less than the greatest news. But women ought to be pretty enthusiastic.CommentsDavis Schneiderman, 2014.10.01Marina Gomberg, 2014.10.01Bill Chameides, 2014.10.01GalTime, 2014.10.01Ryan Thomas Neace, 2014.10.01Elisa Batista, 2014.10.01Kai Sato, 2014.10.01Janell Burley Hofmann, 2014.10.01Nikki Fotheringham, 2014.10.01Hipmunk, 2014.10.01Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"PORT BOSS FEARED DEATHS",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BizYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
