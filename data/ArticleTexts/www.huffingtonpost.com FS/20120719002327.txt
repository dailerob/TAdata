{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressMichael Tomasky this week reflected on the not-yet-invited-to-the-convention Sarah Palin, and wonders why Romney hasn\u0027t extended the invitation to the former governor of Alaska. It\u0027s interesting to note that Tomasky\u0027s operating under the assumption that the only people who can fill a space that might otherwise be occupied by Sarah Palin are those who ran against Romney for the GOP nomination. There\u0027s no doubt that Palin, who\u0027s already off to a good start as a 2012 endorser, has kept her brand in better shape than those whom Romney defeated during his march through the primary calendar. But it actually hadn\u0027t occurred to me that any of the vanquished candidates would provide a prime-time presence at the convention anyway.Read Post | Comments (1,042)Michael B.

It isn\u0027t a vacation during which women eat bonbons, watch TV and hit the spa. It isn\u0027t restful, peaceful or relaxing.
