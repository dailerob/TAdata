{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupWhat goes around comes around, and with the Bushes temporarily quiescent and the Tea Party in control of the U.S. House -- and much of the GOP grassroots -- Karl Rove is fighting a rear-guard action in a far more difficult position than a generation ago. Tea Partiers rightly ask what Rove and his rich-as-Croesus Crossroads PAC have gotten for conservatives or even the GOP. Rove is a master tactician, but not necessarily a great judge of political horseflesh. The war for the soul of the Republican Party is real, deep and reminiscent of that earlier conflict. For the GOP it ended well: they harnessed the energy at the grassroots to take over Washington. This equally bitter GOP civil war may end in the party\u0027s revival, too.
