{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Writer and FilmmakerSince in office, Barack Obama has been more interested in policy than politics, but policy alone isn\u0027t enough anymore. Which is why the president\u0027s threat this week to veto any deficit-reduction bill that doesn\u0027t include tax increases on the wealthy along with cuts to Medicare is so important. It\u0027s not just the issue, but for once he seems to be fighting for the American people. For once, it appears like he gets it. Is it too late? There is no way of knowing if voters have irretrievably soured on the president. But something had to change.Read Post | Comments (57)Rashad Robinson, 9/22/11Executive Director, ColorOfChangeBefore he died, Troy told us that this was about more than him -- and he called on those of us who have fought against his execution to continue fighting for justice, even if we weren\u0027t successful in saving his life.Read Post | Comments (62)Vicki Escarra, 09.21.2011President and CEO of Feeding AmericaEvery person and every sector has an obligation to help our fellow citizens and ensure America\u0027s prosperity. Hunger is an urgent issue in America, and we must do something about it now. Not tomorrow or next year, but now. People are suffering today.Read Post | Comments (3)Bob Cesca, 9/21/11Producer, Editor of BobCesca.comRick Perry\u0027s new video is a fantastic example of the Republican capacity to obfuscate the truth and win supporters in spite of flagrantly lying to them. They\u0027re able to get away with whopper lies so massive, they\u0027re almost hilariously off the rails.Read Post | Comments (571)Dan Rather, 9/22/11Host, \u0027Dan Rather Reports\u0027Why should we care about the plight of honeybees?

The President has lost his groove.Read Post | Comments (43)Holly B.

Carolyn Maloney, 9/22/11U.S. Representative for New York\u0027s 14th DistrictThis President not only supports women and the issues that impact them on a daily basis, but puts policies in place to help women and their families thrive.
