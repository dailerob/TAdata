{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Josh HorwitzExecutive Director, Coalition to Stop Gun ViolenceThe armed gathering of pro-gun activists, anti-government groups and right-wing-politicians at Bundy\u0027s ranch did not happen in a political vacuum. It was the result of decades of propaganda from the National Rifle Association and other gun lobby groups; propaganda that (perversely) informs Americans that they have an individual right under the Second Amendment to shoot elected officials, law enforcement officers, and military service members if they sense our government has become \"tyrannical.\" With the next NRA convention just around the corner this weekend in Indianapolis, it will be interesting to see what their leaders have to say about the recent crisis in Bunkerville. Will Wayne LaPierre, Ted Nugent and the rest reap what they have sowed and embrace Cliven Bundy as a poster child for \"Second Amendment freedoms\"?It\u0027s not 100 percent clear the extent to which Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia meant what it sounded like he meant, but tossing around the word \"revolt\" in the context of a discussion of the U.S. government is never a smart nor rational idea.Bob CescaManaging Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowHopefully today\u0027s name change, while so meaningful to me personally, can also raise awareness of the fact that we trans* people exist everywhere in America today, and that we must jump through hurdles every day just for being who we are.Chelsea ManningFormer U.S. Army intelligence analyst, military whistleblower and democracy advocateYour spouse is growing distant. You\u0027re terrified of losing your job. Your teenager is driving you insane. On the inside, you\u0027re falling apart.

Lee SarokinRetired federal judgeWhile I\u0027m happy for any conversation about gender gaps that need closing, I\u0027m not interested in teaching adult women how to become more confident. I want women to keep the confidence they have as young girls. The confidence we, collectively, crush.Soraya ChemalyFeminist, Writer, Satirist... not always in that orderIn the future, the economy and society will re-orient itself around collaborative commons, with a more peripheric role for the market dynamics.Michel BauwensFounder, Foundation for Peer-to-Peer AlternativesA weight has been lifted -- one I never knew I was carrying. My legs cry in pain every time I move, but my heart is lighter. The Boston Marathon hurt me last year. But that same great race made me stronger and gave me back my finish line. And with it, a new PR of 3:42:34.Heather Mayer IrvineMarathoner, copywriterIn 2008 Oprah and the spiritual teacher and author Eckhart Tolle held a number of conversations as part of their Web series Oprah \u0026 Eckhart Tolle: A New Earth. Now they\u0027re bringing those episodes to television for the first time, Sundays at noon on OWN, the Oprah Winfrey Network. Since my new book Thrive is concerned with many of the same questions, I asked Tolle about the series, why this is a conversation we as a society need to have now, and the moment he knew he needed to change his life. Here\u0027s our conversation.Arianna HuffingtonBy carving out time away from being busy, I have been able to think clearly about my long-term goals. I have avoided jumping on the treadmill when I know that I should keep going at my own pace. And while I can still feel guilty about it, I sometimes slow down to soak in the moment.Nafees SyedLaw student, Former Congressional stafferI wish I could tell you that I\u0027m killing it at dating right now, but the truth is I\u0027m still terrified I\u0027ll always be living under the shadow of my rape.Jessie KahnweilerFilmmaker; Comedian; AquariusEverything depends on whether Tehran, and not just President Hassan Rouhani, is serious. No surprise, many analysts -- and more importantly, paladins of Capitol Hill -- remain skeptical. And that doubt has fueled efforts to impose new sanctions, which would impede if not kill efforts to reach a final accord.Doug BandowSenior Fellow, the Cato InstituteIn the first few weeks, the community really supports the rape victim, but then there is a shift and the rape victim becomes isolated while the community circles around to defend the perpetrator.Terry O\u0027NeillPresident, National Organization for WomenThere are many signs today that we may be in the early stages of a new mass extinction.

Would you starve her, ravage her, drill her, strip her, pollute her, poison her, frack her, crowd her, pave her, drain her, extract her, constrain her, imprison her?Jamie Lee CurtisActress and children\u0027s book authorTo let many men tell it, they are experts at deciphering the intentions of women and wooing them towards a mutual attraction, but this confidence quickly disperses when it comes to discussion of sexual assault.Gordon BraxtonBlogger and activistCan you imagine a musician who does not listen to music himself? The same question can be asked about writing.Mike HanskiContent strategistAs Bostonians we took back our city, we ran to heal and move forward. We did not run as men or women, Christians or Muslims, elites or Average Joes. We ran as a city, we ran as a collective of humanity in its finest hour.Leanne ScorzoniWriter, educator, seeker of knowledge and free speech advocate.BabyCenterLeading pregnancy and parenting websiteChildren, women and a scattering of men, who have endured unspeakable violence and anguish, loss and horror, agony -- biblical in force and nature -- and have responded with unbounded love. Redemption. Resurrection. Faith. I leave Haiti with these gifts in abundance.Kerry KennedyPresident, Robert F.
