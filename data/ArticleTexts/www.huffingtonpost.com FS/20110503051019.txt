{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Business Editor, The Huffington PostOsama bin Laden is gone, and that is better than the alternative. But the celebration over his death feels misplaced. The remnants of his most successful strike on American soil remain intact through the collective sense of powerlessness that frames the conversation. He has proven to our adversaries that, when we are frightened, we lose our way. Until we find our way back, standing in the street high-fiving his death may feel good, but our circumstances are little changed.Read Post | CommentsHoward Fineman, 05.02.2011Editorial Director, Huffington Post Media GroupBy calmly and meticulously overseeing the successful targeting of Osama bin Laden, President Barack Obama just proved himself -- vividly, in almost Biblical terms -- to be an effective commander-in-chief of the armed forces of the United States.Read Post | CommentsJason Linkins and Ben Craw, 05.02.2011Before we got the news Sunday night, America got about a solid hour of ramping and vamping, as newspeople took to the teevee to make wild speculation about what it was that they were all summoned back to work to report.Read Post | CommentsKristen Breitweiser, 05.02.20119/11 widow and activistCan Osama\u0027s death ever be a true victory when so many don\u0027t even seem to comprehend the magnitude of what has been lost along the way? Or even what the future might hold? Was it all worth it?Read Post | CommentsAmb. Marc Ginsberg, 05.02.2011Former U.S. Ambassador to MoroccoBin Laden and al Qaeda had become a much resented burden on the Arab psyche, as the backlash against the Muslim-on-Muslim terrorism could no longer be dismissed as merely collateral damage to al Qaeda\u0027s Western targets.Read Post | CommentsChris Matthews, 05.02.2011Host, MSNBC\u0027s \"Hardball with Chris Matthews\"Less than a week ago, Obama was showing us his birth certificate. This is a man who kept cool through all this clatter and nonsense, knowing he had other work to do.Read Post | CommentsJim Wallis, 05.02.2011Christian leader for social changeIt is never a Christian response to celebrate the death of any human being. Violence is always an indication of our failure to resolve our conflicts by peaceful means, and is always an occasion for deeper reflection.Read Post | CommentsMichael Shaw, 05.02.2011Publisher of the visual politics and photojournalism site, BagNewsNotesThere are some radically different ways of reading this picture. Are we looking at understandable pride and justifiable relief, dancing on a grave, or \"jingoism meets Spring Break\"?Read Post | CommentsHuffington Post, 05.02.2011What does the death of Osama bin Laden mean for America, for the world? HuffPost bloggers are exploring these questions, and many more.Read Post | CommentsAdam Chandler, 05.02.2011Brooklyn-based writer and journalistBeneath it all, a lot of us had capitulated or simply become too anxious about what baggage had accumulated on the road to a compound in Abbottabad. Until tonight.Read Post | CommentsPaul Carr, 05.02.2011British author, columnist, hotel-dwellerGoodman looks like a man born to be mayor of Las Vegas. His desk and floor-to-ceiling shelves are packed with memorabilia of the town, from life-sized showgirls to mayoral poker chips. It\u0027s public office, as designed by TGI Fridays.Read Post | CommentsLauren Ashburn, 05.02.2011Partner, Endeavor GroupIt\u0027s a shame it takes a tragedy of the magnitude of 9/11 or the death of a murderer for us to find common ground. While I know today\u0027s shared joy will be fleeting and tomorrow\u0027s grind will shake us back to reality, it will fuel the optimist in me for years to come.Read Post | CommentsChris Weigant, 05.02.2011Political Writer and Blogger at ChrisWeigant.comTo me, the most momentous phrase in the American lexicon is when a friend calls up and says some version of, \"Turn on your television... to any channel.\" What made last night different, though, was that the news was not bad.Read Post | CommentsMarty Kaplan, 05.02.2011Director, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolIf we had shared intelligence with Pakistan, the chances that it would not have leaked are about zero. Pakistan knows that, just as it knows that the palaver about friendship is meant to conceal as much as it reveals. We\u0027re all in on the wink.Read Post | CommentsRobert Kuttner, 05.02.2011Co-founder and co-editor of The American ProspectConsumer prices are flat in substantial part because China sends us so much stuff, dirt cheap. But all that may be changing, and the change will be a mixed blessing.Read Post | CommentsScott MacLeod, 05.02.2011Former TIME Middle East correspondent, Professor at American University in CairoBecause of the spectacular crime he pulled off on 9/11, American politicians and a mass media fanning the good-versus-evil storyline elevated bin Laden to heights of influence that had little to do with reality.Read Post | CommentsJason Linkins, 05.02.2011Editor, Eat the PressIt was in a speech back in August of 2007 that Barack Obama first made it clear that he was willing to chase down bin Laden in Pakistan, if necessary. It\u0027s interesting to remember now the reaction he got at that time.Read Post | CommentsDean Baker, 05.02.2011Co-Director of the Center for Economic and Policy ResearchMcCaskill\u0027s proposal to put strict caps on government spending operates from the blatantly wrong premise that spending has grown out of control. Those familiar with arithmetic know it has increased by little.Read Post | CommentsMichael Brenner, 05.02.2011Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghWashington is irrevocably committed to dominate Afghanistan on its own terms, based on a dire reading of its own interests, and expects Pakistan to serve as an obedient client.Read Post | CommentsRobert Creamer, 05.02.2011Political organizer, strategist and authorSunday\u0027s White House announcement did more than any long form birth certificate to convince many ordinary voters that Barack Obama is precisely the kind of leader that makes them proud to be an American.Read Post | CommentsDan Collins, 05.02.2011New York Editor-At-Large of The Huffington PostWe\u0027re being warned bin Laden\u0027s death will send a pack of revenge-bent bombers back in our direction. We\u0027ll shrug. Maybe take a cab for a day or two, and then return to our imperfect reality for as long as we can get away with it.Read Post | CommentsMedea Benjamin, 05.02.2011Co-founder, CODEPINK: Women for PeaceLet us not sink into a false sense of triumphalism in the wake of Bin Laden\u0027s passing. His death will only have meaning if it marks the beginning of the end of this ruthless cycle of violence.Read Post | CommentsDonna Marsh O\u0027Connor, 05.02.2011Member, September 11th Families for Peaceful Tomorrows; Mother, Vanessa Lang Langer, WTC Tower II, 93rd floorFor ten years I blamed many for my daughter Vanessa\u0027s death and more for what they did after to make the world more hateful, more violent. But I never knew how much was tied up in the metaphoric bin Laden.Read Post | CommentsChristopher LaTondresse, 05.02.2011Founder and CEO, Recovering EvangelicalOnly God truly knows what evil is. We just like to pretend we do. All too often we, like those who have come before us, see evil exclusively in the faces of our adversaries and good only in those who bless us.Read Post | CommentsRandy Turner, 05.02.2011English teacherHow fortunate is it for students across America that bin Laden\u0027s death took place at a time when standardized tests have been completed for this school year?Read Post | CommentsPaul Brandeis Raushenbush, 05.02.2011Religion Editor, Huffington PostThrough actions and belief, Osama Bin Laden profaned the name of God and denigrated all people of faith.Read Post | CommentsMary Beth Powers, 2011.05.03Adam Roberts, 2011.05.02Jonathan Schmock, 2011.05.02Daniel Brooks, 2011.05.02Jonathan Lewis, 2011.05.02Karen Brody, 2011.05.02Paul Carr, 2011.05.02Mike McCready, 2011.05.02Elisha Goldstein, Ph.D., 2011.05.02Earl Ofari Hutchinson, 2011.05.02","h1":"Using a mobile device?
