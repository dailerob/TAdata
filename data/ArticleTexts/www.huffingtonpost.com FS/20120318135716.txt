{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, March Madness extended beyond college basketball to the GOP presidential contest as former 16th-seed-turned-title-contender Rick Santorum continued his bracket-busting run by shooting the lights out in Mississippi and Alabama to win the South regional. Luckily for Mitt Romney, the GOP nomination, unlike the NCAA tournament, is not a one-and-done competition -- but it\u0027s looking more and more like the game might go down to the final buzzer, if not into overtime. Will the GOP convention actually end up being a jump ball? It might if Romney continues to babble on about all the super-rich sports team owners he knows (this week\u0027s gaffe centered on Peyton Manning\u0027s free agency). Here\u0027s an idea: Romney should just release a list of all the super-rich sports team owners he knows and get it over with. Or perhaps it would be simpler if he just named the super-rich sports team owners he doesn\u0027t know.Read Post | Comments (26)Barbara Ehrenreich, 03/15/12New York Times bestselling authorBy the Reagan era, the \"culture of poverty\" had become a cornerstone of conservative ideology: poverty was caused, not by low wages or a lack of jobs, but by bad attitudes and faulty lifestyles.Read Post | Comments (770)Mark Cuban, 03/13/12Owner, Dallas Mavericks; Chairman, HDNetWhen I read that Yahoo was suing Facebook my immediate reaction was disdain.

For 30 years well-meaning diet gurus have preached that eating fat makes you fat. I\u0027m here to tell you that fat, in and of itself, is not what is making you fat. Instead, it\u0027s eating too much of the wrong kinds of fat.Read Post | Comments (79)Evelyn Robert de Rothschild, 03/14/12FinancierI owe my life to the remarkable generosity of America\u0027s political system, which under legislation from Franklin D. Roosevelt welcomed thousands of children from England during World War II. It is out of this respect, and out of a fear for how money is corroding America\u0027s political system, that I call for a rethink of how we approach campaign finance.Read Post | Comments (132)Marian Wright Edelman, 03/16/12President, Children\u0027s Defense FundNext week marks the second anniversary of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the federal health reform legislation, which has been a giant national step forward in reaching the goal of ensuring that all children in America receive the healthy start they need and deserve.Read Post | Comments (246)Noel Gallagher, 03/16/12Singer/Songwriter; Noel Gallagher\u0027s High Flying BirdsOutside my gig they have A LOT of bootleg t-shirt stalls.
