{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressWith four Republican nominating contests in the books, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio has managed to earn finishes ranging from second to fifth place. These would be great results if Rubio were the U.S. Men\u0027s National Soccer Team. Unfortunately, Marco Rubio is a candidate for the GOP\u0027s presidential nomination. Does he know what that entails? Based upon an interview he gave to Fox News on the Wednesday after the Nevada caucus, it\u0027s an open question. Rubio is right about one thing: You actually don\u0027t win the nomination by how many states you win. But for the moment, you have to win at least eight of them to qualify to be the nominee. And merely winning those states is just the first step.With Facebook reaction buttons Zuckerberg is responding to years of feedback from Facebook users who felt odd about \"liking\" posts that, perhaps, had bad news, like someone\u0027s dog dying, or posts about things that made them angry.Technology journalistBlack women who care are the backbone of the American economy, and yet little attention is given to the conditions that Black women who care face. If Black futures are to matter in our economy, we must, at minimum, ensure that the Black women who care for us are cared for in return.Special Projects Director for the National Domestic Workers Alliance and co-creator, #BlackLivesMatter. Organizer, writer \u0026 freedom dreamerRepublican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee announced that they will not consider any nominee put forward by our nation\u0027s president. This is unconscionable. If they carry through on this threat, it will be directly incompatible with their solemn responsibilities under the U.S. Constitution.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoWith thousands of jobs being added in the past few years, people everywhere are praising the industry for rebuilding our economy and the middle class. But as those of us who work at auto plants know, that\u0027s not the full story.Auto parts workerSoon after I began reporting on the military, I uncovered something quite disturbing: that thousands of our wounded soldiers are being discharged from the military not for their injuries but for \"personality disorder.\"Investigative Reporter, The NationOur economy is currently resisting treacherous global economic conditions. It is in the interest of the rest of the world for the U.S. to play this role. And that is exactly what Sanders\u0027 proposals do.Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureI still argue with myself over the need to apologize to dead animals, but I no longer have to fight against apologizing to tires or old t-shirts or single discarded shoes. I still battle with the universe and my expectation that it is just looking for an excuse to ruin everything. I still seek balance.Concert-going, upcycling, roller skating, weather lover - awkwardly navigating life.As a hijab-wearing Muslim woman, I garnered a lot of media attention. The coverage and response was overwhelmingly supportive and encouraging. However, there was some vile chatter that attempted to paint me as a possible terrorist.Co-founder and President of the Muslim Women of the CarolinasIn any properly functioning society, Apple would get adulation for standing up to a government trying to do this.

Sh*t piled on them by people like this clown.Coauthor, \u0027How Will You Measure Your Life?\u0027Pakistan\u0027s military and intelligence agencies are waging a nasty war on U.S.-based scholars whose writings and public statements undermine cherished narratives promulgated by the army that has dominated Pakistan\u0027s governance for most of the state\u0027s existence.Associate professor, Georgetown University; Author, Fighting to the End: The Pakistan Army’s Way of WarFear is why we saw the rise of mass surveillance, metadata collection and an invasion of our privacy. Fear is why people are okay with looking the other way when innocent civilians are killed from our wars. Are we now going to allow fear to drive us to give up even more of our liberties? Or will freedom truly win over fear?Independent Journalist, Producer, Multimedia ProfessionalConsider that while you\u0027re just joking around, a woman might actually be doing some quick mental math to see if she\u0027s going to have to hide in a fucking bathroom stall and call someone to come help her, like I did three days ago.Event planner, wine expert and lapsed marathonA very similar trickle-down agenda worked badly for Romney/Ryan, allowing the opposition to portray their candidacy as out-of-touch plutocrats, unconcerned about middle-class income stagnation and inequality.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorIt\u0027s easy to get tired of being the glue that holds together this delicate balance. The chauffeur, the chef, the maid, the tutor, the event planner. But without all of these things, I\u0027d have no front row seat to their lives and the million subtle ways they grow and change with every experience.Composition instructor and writing center directorOnce I removed the dogmatic lens that had informed my biblical interpretations, I found a figure that defended a prostitute and ate with the poor. The life of Jesus simply didn\u0027t reflect the agenda of the political right, so now neither could I.PhD in Religious Studies, Host of The Brain Candy PodcastAmerican conservatives love to say that raising the minimum wage is a \"job killer.\" They like to cite figures from the Congressional Budget Office that suggest the country would lose 500,000 jobs if the minimum wage was raised. For a while there, their boogieman worked.President of the Patriotic Millionaires, public policy expert, commentator, and authorTrump Wins the Nevada Caucus; Senate GOP Pledges to Not Hold Hearings on Obama SCOTUS Nominee; Obama\u0027s New Plan to Close Gitmo; Jeb is Out of the Race; and much more.Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez Show, Writer for Salon.comIf law enforcement is required to show probable cause to a judge that a crime has been committed or is being planned in order to execute a search, that burden -- not warrant-proof encryption -- is the strongest protection of our privacy from state intrusion.United States Senator (Ret.)Manhattan District AttorneyWhile I\u0027ve learned to appreciate my parent\u0027s age and the stability and wiseness that comes with it, I\u0027m still envious of my friends.

Too good to be true? Probably. Misleading? Perhaps.Head of the Calhoun School in ManhattanWhen jazz music became popular, people said that it wasn\u0027t music. When rock and roll became popular, people said it wasn\u0027t music. When The Beatles came to America, people said it wasn\u0027t music. I think it\u0027s time that we stop considering songs \"not music.\"Writer, performer and filmmakerLike so many communities throughout our state and across the country, Ithaca is struggling with addiction and substance abuse. This is our a new normal. We are an enlightened, educated and compassionate community. What can we do?Tompkins County District Attorney and Co-Chair, Ithaca Municipal Drug Policy CommitteeHow smart is your smartphone? Until recently, not that smart, actually.

It is my hope to make the epilepsy journey a little less stressful and exhausting.Founder, The Epilepsy NetworkRepublicans hate taxes. They support traditional marriage. They want smaller government, which means cutting social programs. They believe in a muscular foreign policy from the Reagan-Bush(es) era. They want to end entitlements, i.e. Social Security and Medicare. But Donald Trump\u0027s meteoric rise and stubborn refusal to fall has shattered this misconception.Editor/Publisher of Inside Michigan PoliticsThe presidential candidates should be talking about their commitments to public health. On March 6th, the Democrats will hold a debate in Flint, a perfect location for this discussion. But both parties should be making public health a top priority.Dean and DeLamar Professor of Public Health, Columbia University Mailman School of Public HealthMuch of the hoopla around the emerging cannabis industry is focused on tax revenue, with states and cities counting the cash (and without banking access, it\u0027s literally cash) that comes with the legal retail sale of cannabis. However, beyond just tax dollars, this industry has value, and it lies in opportunity, empowerment, and self-determination.California Policy Manager, Drug Policy AllianceDays after winning in Nevada, I asked Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton why she believes women writ large are not rallying around her.
