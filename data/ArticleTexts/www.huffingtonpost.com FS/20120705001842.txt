{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Founder, Define AmericanTo me, what it means to be an American goes beyond your place of birth or the documents you have, back to when throngs of Irish, Italian and Eastern Europeans crossed the Atlantic Ocean in search of a better life, no papers asked. What it means to be an American is less about who you are than what you are about-- how you live your life, how you contribute to this country, how you pledge allegiance to a flag hoping and praying it will make room for you. What it means to be an American is in the hearts of the people who, in their struggles and heartaches, in their joys and triumphs, fight for America and fight to be American every day.Read Post | Comments (84)Norman Lear, 07/03/12Founder, People for the American WayMy love for and devotion to our country goes back to incidents in my childhood, my service in World War II, and my involvement since 1980 in fighting those who would have us believe that people are good Christians or bad ones depending on their political points of view.Read Post | Comments (220)Michael Roth, 07/04/12President, Wesleyan UniversityI\u0027ve been so impressed by the consistent links between education and freedom that run through American intellectual history.

But true patriotism means paying for America and coming together for the common good.Read Post | Comments (532)Steve Clemons, 07/04/12Publisher, \u0027The Washington Note\u0027America\u0027s Independence Day really should be July 2nd and not July 4th. So happy Independence Day -- and a salute to the day it happened and when we finally got around to the party!Read Post | CommentsArianna Huffington, 07/03/12The narrow survival of the Affordable Care Act last week was certainly cause for celebration. But as the jubilation subsides, it\u0027s important to realize that having avoided what would have been a giant step backward doesn\u0027t mean we\u0027ve taken a giant step forward.Read Post | Comments (347)Paul Rieckhoff, 07/04/12Founder of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of AmericaFor 99% of Americans, this Fourth of July marks yet another annual tradition of barbecues, block parties and fireworks. It\u0027s the halfway point of a long hot summer. A day to celebrate freedom, \u0027Merica, and being born in the U.S.A. But for the other one percent? The war still rages on.Read Post | CommentsMarlo Thomas, 06/29/12Award-winning actress, author, and activistAs the granddaughter of Lebanese and Italian immigrants who came to this country to start a new life, the Fourth of July signifies the birthday of a nation that opened its arms to my family, and has given us the opportunity to flourish ever since.Read Post | Comments (26)Paul Abrams, 07/04/12Last person on Earth not on FacebookLet us, today, celebrate both our inalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and that to secure these rights we need government whose powers are based on the consent of the governed.Read Post | Comments (76)Lee Woodruff, 07/04/12Co-author, \u0027In an Instant\u0027, Author, \u0027Perfectly Imperfect\u0027More than 10 years after 9/11, we are tentative patriots. We gauge our neighbors\u0027 politics, we stick a finger in the air to test the atmosphere before considering a declaration of love for our country.Read Post | Comments (30)Thomas Brennan, 07/03/12Sergeant, U.S. Marine CorpsWhile reciting the Pledge of Allegiance and taking your hat off during the National Anthem are a few of the ways we honor our nation\u0027s colors, there lives a man in Richlands, North Carolina who chooses to honor the flag differently.Read Post | Comments (32)Chris Kelly, 07/04/12Writer, \u0027Real Time with Bill Maher\u0027A stump speech can talk about America and not sound like someone\u0027s mom wrote their class president campaign speech on their hand.

And that means it\u0027s a good opportunity to go for that long bike ride, finally get your kayak down to the lake or try a new fitness class that doesn\u0027t fit in with your regular work week schedule.Read Post | CommentsRichard (RJ) Eskow, 07/04/12Writer; host, \u0027The Breakdown\u0027; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureGeorge III is gone. But there are other tyrants, and it\u0027s time to re-declare independence from them: cynical cheaters on Wall Street and the politicians who serve them; austerity advocates who would have the many pay the price for the greed of the few; and mind-numbing consumerism that keeps us economically and emotionally enslaved.Read Post | Comments (82)Maxwell Kennedy, 07/04/12Author, attorney and environmentalistI know that we are citizens of the greatest country in the world. It is not our resources nor our achievements, but the fundamental spirit of America; the imagination, discipline, dedication to excellence and generosity, particularly of our young people that continues to make us great.Read Post | CommentsRichard Trumka, 07/03/12President, AFL-CIOLet\u0027s call this right-wing \"freedom\" catch phrase what it really is: a grossly political strategy to dupe the public, which holds the word \"freedom\" as something sacred.Read Post | Comments (1,179)Elliott Negin, 07/03/12Director of News \u0026 Commentary, Union of Concerned Scientists\"If we want fewer cancers, less heart disease, more forests, and less global warming,\" says Doug Boucher, director of UCS\u0027s Tropical Forest and Climate Initiative, \"we should eat less beef.\"Read Post | Comments (361)Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, 07/03/12Rabbi and WriterThe necessity of taming the American wilderness bred a rugged American pioneering spirit that even today remains the envy of the world.Read Post | Comments (17)Marty Kaplan, 07/01/12Director, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolFaced with looming catastrophes like climate change, we\u0027re -- oh, hell, there I go again, talking myself out onto a ledge.

But hold this thought as well: that behind this Fourth of July holiday are human beings who were as flawed and conflicted as they were inspired. If they were to look upon us today, they most likely would think how much remains to be done.Read Post | Comments (174)Susie Sampson, 07/03/12Patriotic AmericanRead Post | CommentsTiphani N.
