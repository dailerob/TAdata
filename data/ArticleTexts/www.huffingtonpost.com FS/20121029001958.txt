{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"The week started off with our last chance to have a real debate between the two presidential candidates. But the Battle in Boca was less of a vetting of the status quo than a ratification of it, as Romney essentially endorsed Obama\u0027s foreign policy. Why are we staying in Afghanistan until the end of 2014? What of the drones, killing people (including civilians) in our name and with little oversight? Instead of answers to those questions, we got horses, bayonets and Battleship. Midweek brought yet another edition of GOP Inappropriate Rape Comment Theater, this one starring Richard Mourdock and \"God\u0027s will.\" The reviews weren\u0027t good. The chance for meaningful debate might have passed, but the window for jaw-dropping remarks about rape will apparently stay open right up to Election Day.Read Post | Comments (212)Charles Ferguson, 10/27/12Director, Wall Street documentary \u0027Inside Job\u0027; Author, \u0027Predator Nation\u0027There is a scandal in Mitt Romney\u0027s campaign -- namely Glenn Hubbard, Romney\u0027s chief economic advisor. Hubbard has long advocated policies that Wall Street loves, often without disclosing that he is, in fact, highly paid by Wall Street.Read Post | Comments (1,217)Chrystia Freeland, 10/21/12Global Editor at Large, ReutersAmerica today urgently needs a 21st-century Henry George -- a thinker who embraces the wealth-creating power of capitalism, but squarely faces the inequity of its current manifestation.Read Post | Comments (1,219)Michelangelo Signorile, 10/26/12Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesWe\u0027ve witnessed many Mitt Romneys, but the one unearthed yesterday is perhaps the most vicious and cruel: a zealot who, as governor, became hellbent on stigmatizing the children of gay and lesbian parents, labeling them outcasts and causing them to suffer hardship throughout their lives.Read Post | Comments (3,402)Paul Douglas, 10/25/12Chief Meteorologist, \u0027WeatherNation TV\u0027; Star Tribune\u0027s \u0027On Weather With Paul Douglas\u0027I\u0027m tracking Hurricane Sandy and I\u0027m sharing some of my thinking with HuffPost readers who may be personally impacted over the next 4-5 days.Read Post | Comments (440)Arianna Huffington, 10/22/12I\u0027m happy to announce that I\u0027ve just returned home from the hospital with a new arrival. I\u0027m not sure how much it weighs, but it seems to be healthy, and it\u0027s already walking -- albeit unsteadily and with a cane.Read Post | Comments (298)Louis M. Guenin, 10/24/12Lecturer on Ethics in Science, Harvard UniversityThe politicians who now travel under the banner of \"conservatism\" happen to espouse views and methods that are incompatible with the philosophy bearing that name. Meanwhile members of the opposing political party have imbibed a dose of the wisdom conveyed by conservatism.Read Post | Comments (937)Mark Cuban, 10/25/12Owner, Dallas Mavericks; Chairman, HDNetThere is no greater opportunity than here in America.

Fortunately there are veritable election oracles I can turn to instead: gamblers.Read Post | Comments (907)James Franco, 10/24/12Actor and authorThe New York Post has been sniffing around for academic gossip because they can\u0027t write about me stumbling out of clubs.

Granholm, 10/23/12Former governor of Michigan; Host, \u0027The War Room\u0027 on Current TV; columnist, Politico; faculty member, UC BerkeleyMitt Romney has the nerve to argue that his plan for the industry in his now-famous New York Times op-ed piece, \"Let Detroit Go Bankrupt,\" was the plan that the Obama administration eventually did: a managed bankruptcy.Read Post | Comments (862)Fred Goldring, 10/26/12Entrepreneur, Strategist, Musician \u0026 LawyerWe hope that our anthem will quickly inject into the public consciousness some sorely missing positivity, optimism, and emotional resonance in the final days before the election.Read Post | Comments (683)Marlo Thomas, 10/23/12Award-winning actress, author, and activistOctober is National Adopt a Shelter Dog Month and we found so many inspiring stories of adopted shelter dogs that have done amazing things -- from saving lives to detecting cancer -- that we decided to put together a collection of stories.Read Post | Comments (162)Gordon Brown, 10/22/12Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationMalala may lie in hospital and she may have been silenced for now -- but millions who now carry her message can find in the run up to Malala Day on November 10th an opportunity to speak for her and ensure that action on girls\u0027 rights and children\u0027s education is no longer delayed.Read Post | Comments (57)Diana Nyad, 10/25/12Long-distance swimmer, journalist, and broadcasterIt is not overstatement to say that Lance Armstrong\u0027s careening fall from grace has no rival in recent American history. Perhaps only Richard Nixon earns equal status of disgrace.Read Post | Comments (176)John Mellencamp, 10/25/12Musician and ActivistThe entertainment business has been criminally assaulted by wrong-headed thinking that says we need to keep up with the Internet. No, search engines need to abide and adhere to the laws that have governed this country for over 200 years. It\u0027s a moral imperative. Thou shalt not steal.Read Post | Comments (838)Maria Bello, 10/22/12ActressWhat do you know about the crisis in Darfur today? Despite the outcry and the attention built around the Darfur genocide movement, little has been done to affect the situation on the ground.Read Post | Comments (30)Richard N. Haass, 10/23/12President, Council on Foreign RelationsA good deal can and will be said about Monday night\u0027s foreign policy debate, but the bottom line may be that it was not so much about foreign policy and not so much a debate.Read Post | Comments (35)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 10/27/12Author, research psychologist, and gender scholarI have good friends. They are in a mixed marriage: she\u0027s a Republican, he\u0027s a Democrat. Both take their respective affiliations seriously. They\u0027ve always made their union of political opposites work. But this season, there is coolness in the political air.Read Post | Comments (214)Sen. Bernie Sanders, 10/25/12Independent U.S. Senator from VermontThe fact is, over the last four years we have begun to transform our energy system, cut greenhouse gas emissions and create new jobs through energy innovation.

One question that comes up consistently is about perinatal mood disorders, and more specifically about postpartum depression.Read Post | CommentsDavid Katz, M.D., 10/26/12Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterWe are hard wired to notice minutes, hours, days, and to some extent, weeks and months. Years are already a bit blurry, and decades were mostly beyond the limits of consideration for most of human history.
