{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, the Oscar race heated up, with Birdman and Grand Budapest Hotel leading the way with nine nominations each. In much more serious news, the planet itself continues to heat up, with NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announcing that 2014 was the hottest year in the 135 years since record-keeping began. What\u0027s more, the next 10 hottest years have all been since 1998. \"The record 2014 temperatures underscore the undeniable fact that we are witnessing, before our eyes, the effects of human-caused climate change,\" said climate scientist Michael Mann. Of course, we\u0027ve seen this movie before -- with alarming warnings about our steadily warming world repeatedly met with inaction. It\u0027s like \"Groundhog Day,\" only without the laughs. Unless we rewrite the script, and push our leaders to adopt the long-term thinking that this challenge requires, we\u0027ll soon be facing a [SPOILER ALERT] very unhappy ending.These men of murder are the symptom of a creed that lies as far away from God as is possible to conceive and do not represent Islam anymore than George Bush, Tony Blair and Halliburton represented Christianity, or ordinary, secular Europeans and Americans when they profited from the bombing of innocent Iraqis.Actor and comedianEvery few days, the headquarters of the U.S.-led war against the Islamic State militias issues a communique on how the war is going.Senior Military Correspondent, The Huffington PostOnly by engaging these global challenges will we be able to serve America\u0027s interests. And when the American people ask us, \"How have you left your country?\" we will have the answer that they -- that we -- yearn to hear.U.S. Ambassador to the United NationsIf this does not change, we fear you and your fellow leaders could be sleep-walking the world towards one of the greatest failures of recent history. It\u0027s not too late to rise to the occasion.Student, Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and co-founder of the Malala FundGrammy award-winning music recording artist; Co-Founder of the Batonga Foundation for Girls EducationFew people today know of Dr. King\u0027s opinions on issues like poverty and income inequality, or of his early support for Israel and his public opposition to the war in Vietnam. This blog post addresses some of the important contemporary domestic and international issues that I believe would be of major concern to Dr. King if he were alive today.Diversity Visiting Professor, University of San Francisco; and Scholar Writer in Residence, MLK, Jr. Institute, Stanford UniversitySeveral of my favorite King quotes speak powerfully to an idea that I believe can help advance King\u0027s vision for America. That idea is large-scale, voluntary national service as a civic rite of passage.CEO and Co-Founder, City YearWherever I travel, the questions follow, suggesting that the U.S., if not exactly crazy, is decidedly a danger to itself and others. It\u0027s past time to wake up, America, and look around. There\u0027s another world out here, an old and friendly one across the ocean, and it\u0027s full of good ideas, tried and true.Author, \u0027They Were Soldiers: How the Wounded Return From America’s Wars -- The Untold Story\u0027Here are six ladies who were either born to great privilege or married into it, but despite their advantages, all met with adversity, as most everyone does at some point in their lives.Author and Historian; author of the acclaimed Anjou Trilogy and frequent lecturer and historical writer.It is very important to remember that fundamentalism in all our faith traditions -- Muslim, Christian, and Jewish -- will be far more effectively defeated from the inside than from the outside.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersWhile the intent of \u0027Yes Means Yes\u0027 is admirable -- and certainly more communication about and around sex is not a bad thing -- government seeking to regulate sex, or any other act, on such a micro level is a symptom of a culture marked by extreme over-parenting -- and it is dangerously enabling.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarNo matter what set of circumstances seem to be conspiring to rob you of your ability to thrive, there is one way you can shift gears, expand your energy, and immediately restore your flow. Be still, take a breath and say, \"I accept.\"Contemporary thought leader and spiritual teacherAccording to a Blacademy spokesperson, \"It\u0027s not that white actors weren\u0027t good enough ... It\u0027s just that there were a lot of great performances by black actors this year. In fact, some very good black actors weren\u0027t even nominated. That\u0027s how you know it\u0027s not a race issue.\"Novelist, Screenwriter, and Associate Professor at Columbia UniversityWriter and filmmakerI first heard Dr. King speak in person at a Spelman College chapel service during my senior year in college. Dr. King was just 31 but he had already gained a national reputation during the successful Montgomery Bus Boycott five years earlier.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe primary challenge democracies face is neither military nor philosophical. Rather, for the first time since the Great Depression, many industrial democracies are failing to raise living standards and provide opportunities for social mobility to a large share of their people.President Emeritus and Charles W. Eliot University Professor of Harvard University and former U.S. Treasury Secretary.Shadow Chancellor of the ExchequerThis is the age of terror only if we are terrorized, which is not a fact but a state of mind. Terrorists are not nihilists. They are meaning-builders. Their whole strategy depends on controlling the meaning of the death of innocents.Professor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027My son turns 14 today. I\u0027m sure he\u0027s wishing for all sorts of stuff: an Xbox, Beats headphones, maybe even good grades. However, my wish for my son on his 14th birthday is much more fundamental. I wish for him to be able to walk to the grocery store without being harassed or gunned down. I wish for him to live.Founder and managing director, Keating AdvisorsThe right of free speech the NYPD are angry about when it comes to the demonstrators is precisely the same right of free speech they\u0027re using to harass de Blasio. And it\u0027s that same ideal of free speech, no matter how noxious it might seem, for which those police in Paris died last week.Senior writer, Moyers \u0026 Company on public TV. Senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.Even if the country would eventually get to national recognition of marriage equality through the democratic process -- and that is a big \"if\" -- the Court is doing its duty by stepping in now.Chief Counsel, Constitutional Accountability CenterUnlike those of the other possible candidates of the GOP establishment, Jeb Bush and Chris Christie, Romney\u0027s positions on gays have been more defined and extreme -- and more consistent and reiterated much more recently, especially since he veered far right in the primaries in 2012. Any change will be seen as a yet another major flip-flop.Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesI grew up with a stutter. Does this mean I shouldn\u0027t have pursued journalism because I stutter? Does this mean I shouldn\u0027t conduct interviews, speak up in meetings or ask questions when I want more clarification?Associate Editor, Blogs \u0026 CommunityWhen I was pregnant, everyone was all about \"warning\" me about what was coming next. I walked around much of those 10 (let\u0027s face it, pregnancy is 10, not nine, months) absolutely terrified.Wife, Mom, Writer, Yogini | www.borntobeabride.comAfter he signed the Voting Rights Act, I asked LBJ if he thought this meant we\u0027d have a black president in our time. He said no, we would have a woman first. Well, one down, another to go.Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyWhen I signed up for the military, I was hoping to make a better world. Instead I helped make it more dangerous. I wanted to do right by my family and my country. Looking back, it\u0027s clear enough to me that my lack of knowledge about the actual mission we were undertaking betrayed me -- and you and us.Author, \u0027Worth Fighting For: An Army Ranger\u0027s Journey Out of the Military and Across America\u0027No challenge in the Democratic Party will have legs unless people are in motion, mobilizing, challenging business as usual, and forcing politicians to get outside of their comfort zone. Dislodging the entrenched interests and big money that dominate our politics won\u0027t be easy.President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureYou must be cringing as you read this. You must be thinking I\u0027m going to school you on how to treat your new boyfriend. You must be thinking I\u0027m going to lay down some laws about how to treat my children. That is not at all what this letter is about.seamstress and freelance writerThere\u0027s a weird and disconcerting trend that I\u0027ve noticed in the past few weeks. Women are being erased. From boardrooms to politics -- and this month, history.Host and producer, HuffPost LiveThis cowardly act against freedom of speech and freedom of expression is reprehensible to all sane people, but sadly, some have used it to exacerbate their already biased views.President, National Action NetworkCentral to King\u0027s philosophy was the idea that men and women of all races deserve the dignity of work, the right to earn more than poverty wages. And he knew that goal was not attainable without full-throated worker voice.U.S. Secretary of LaborWhat if we refused to allow January to shame us into feelings of inadequacy? What if we took a cue from toddlers everywhere and turned up our noses at what January was serving us?Mother, Wife, Blogger, mamabythebay.comThese elaborate illegal acts over many years show a deliberate willingness by Credit Suisse AG officials to knowingly engage in profitable activities that defrauded the U.S. Treasury and burdened honest taxpayers. But the Credit Suisse story does not end there.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"SEATTLE STUNNER",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
