{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Authors, Winner-Take-All Politics: How Washington Made the Rich Richer—And Turned Its Back on the Middle ClassThe distance between Planet Washington and Planet Earth has never been greater. On Planet Washington, the new alpha species is Republicans (and some cooperative Democrats). They\u0027re pushing the same all-purpose tonic they peddled when the unemployment rate was low: cuts in social programs for the middle class and poor, tax cuts for the wealthiest, removal of any restrictions on the activities of big business.

It is a profoundly ideological and entirely unrealistic set of policy prescriptions.Read Post | CommentsJohann Hari, 11.11.2010Columnist for the London IndependentClegg is one of the great mysteries of British politics. In just a few days after the election, he cleared a space in his swanky new ministerial offices and staged a bonfire of his principles.Read Post | CommentsPaul Rieckhoff, 11.11.2010Executive Director and Founder, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of AmericaIt doesn\u0027t matter if you voted for the Green Party or the Tea Party, live in Boston or the Bayou; Veterans Day is about uniting as a country and supporting our nation\u0027s troops and veterans.Read Post | CommentsSteve Clemons, 11.11.2010Publisher of \"The Washington Note\"I can\u0027t help wondering whether Cindy McCain misses her straight-talking husband as much as I do -- a McCain that is going to be relevant to our future, not one we have to be ashamed of because he \"delayed\" the normalization of gay rights.Read Post | CommentsAaron Sorkin, 11.11.2010Playwright, screenwriter and television writerIf you really want to honor our troops you won\u0027t use them for an easy applause line, you won\u0027t use them to get votes, or, most insulting to them of all, to divide us into real Americans and fake Americans.Read Post | CommentsArianna Huffington, 11.10.2010To honor the sacrifice and service of the men and women of America\u0027s armed services, HuffPost Impact is launching Salute to Service -- for veterans who have committed their time, energy, and effort to serving their fellow soldiers.Read Post | CommentsIsabel Macdonald, 11.11.2010Freelance journalistIt is perhaps not surprising that Dobbs is being offered a position at the Fox Business Network. After all, being an embarrassment to the journalism profession has never been an impediment to landing a job at Fox.Read Post | CommentsMadeleine Albright, 11.11.2010Chair, Albright Stonebridge GroupIn engaging the Muslim world, Western leaders must not gloss over differences or duck hard issues. Superficial courtesy is easy, but the path to agreement on the application of moral principles is arduous.Read Post | CommentsAlana B. Elias Kornfeld, 11.11.2010Senior Editor, Living, Health and Religion at The Huffington PostWith more and more veterans coming home within the next few years, reentry will be a major issue of our times. In order to combat the potential that exists for our troops to be sidelined, I propose a reverse draft.Read Post | CommentsRobert L. Borosage, 11.10.2010President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureVoters increasingly believe Washington is controlled by special interests that feed off their tax dollars and that politicians cannot hear them. Both the White House and the Republicans seem intent on proving that.Read Post | CommentsDaniel Beaty, 11.11.2010Playwright, Performer, star of Through the NightI was enraged and deeply saddened after seeing For Colored Girls. Our children are being dropped every day, but when are we going to start to explore the real reasons why that is happening?Read Post | CommentsAndy Borowitz, 11.11.2010Comedian and creator of BorowitzReport.comAccording to a Somali pirate spokesperson, the recent fire that crippled the giant cruise ship Carnival Splendor \"has sent a shiver through the pirate community.\"Read Post | CommentsBishop James Magness, 11.11.2010Bishop Suffragan, Federal Ministries of The Episcopal ChurchNearly one in four homeless persons is a veteran. Shocked? You should be, because these are the people who served you, many of whom risked their lives when they went off to fight this country\u0027s wars.Read Post | CommentsLawrence Lessig, 11.11.2010Professor of Law, Harvard Law SchoolThe Tea Party is right to push to abolish earmarks from Congress, and the defenders of the status quo are either deceivers, or just plain dumb.Read Post | CommentsSgt. Max Harris, 11.11.2010Army translator, appears in HBO’s \u0027Wartorn 1861-2010\u0027When I returned home from service overseas, I was diagnosed with PTSD. The irony is that I was so concerned about controlling everything around me; I didn\u0027t notice that, physically, I was a mess.Read Post | CommentsLorelei Kelly, 11.11.2010Director, New Strategic Security InitiativeThe Defense Department should be red meat for the Tea Party. The best thing new Tea Party-elects can do for veterans will be to stop our unaudited spending and unaccountable behavior in that realm.Read Post | CommentsHuffington Post, 11.11.2010When it comes to war, our veterans often get lost in discussions defined by heated political opinions on either side. This Veterans Day, we\u0027d like to put politics aside and focus on the soldiers and veterans themselves.Read Post | CommentsRobert Creamer, 11.11.2010Political organizer, strategist and authorFederal deficit commission members have lost their memories. They seem to have forgotten what caused the deficit. And they have certainly forgotten that we know how to eliminate the deficit without making the middle class pay the bill.Read Post | CommentsKatrina Alcorn, 11.11.2010Writer, web consultantI don\u0027t know when I decided to call it a nervous breakdown. Some can\u0027t even have this conversation because it would mean looking at things they\u0027re trying not to see. I know how they feel because two years ago, I was one of them.Read Post | CommentsElizabeth Abbott, 11.11.2010Writer, historianVeterans seldom return home unscathed by their wartime experiences, and as they attempt to reintegrate into civil society, resuming or reshaping intimate relationships is among their biggest challenges.Read Post | CommentsLt. Dan Choi, 11.11.2010For some veterans, the healing cannot begin until we enlist in another war at home.

Wedel, 11.11.2010When institutional walls separating functions and ensuring balance of power are weak, players can concentrate and intensify their influence.
