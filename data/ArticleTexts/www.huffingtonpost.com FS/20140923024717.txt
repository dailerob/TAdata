{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027We have the central bank of the US acting deliberately to keep workers from getting pay increases. They justify their actions over concerns about inflation, but we need not take these seriously. Who knows what they believe, but the real-world risk of a dangerous inflationary spiral ranks alongside the risk of attacks by Martians. It ain\u0027t going to happen, and they should know this. Of course high unemployment is not the only policy that has kept wages down over the last three decades. Government policy has also made it almost impossible for workers to organize unions. And of course we have let the minimum wage fall way behind the cost of living and even further behind productivity.In America, people with lots of money can easily avoid the consequences of bad bets and big losses by cashing out at the first sign of trouble. But workers who move to a place like Atlantic City for a job and invest in a home have no such protection.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027We all know that banning books is wrong. So why is it so tempting?Executive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostWhy on earth did the Scots, largely quiescent as part of Great Britain for three centuries, suddenly become the mouse that roared? It wasn\u0027t because they became besotted watching re-runs of Braveheart or Rob Roy, or even because they coveted more of a share of North Sea oil revenues.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027I have long understood that climate change is not only an environmental issue -- it is a humanitarian, economic, health, and justice issue as well. Today\u0027s march reflected all those concerns.President, NRDCDespite promises made by world leaders, progress on education has stalled, financial aid to basic education is being reduced and both schools and school children are under attack. And now young people see an attack on one student as an attack on them all.Co-Founder, A World at School; Executive Chair, Global Business Coalition for EducationAt a certain point, we will discover ourselves unable to outlaw or repent or pray away the carbon dioxide and methane blanketing the planet. If that time comes, no change of mind or heart or law will be able to derail our rendez-vous with catastrophe.USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorWhen most 20-somethings have dating questions, they call a single friend. A few might call their moms. But what if your \"person\" is a 60-plus guy who also happens to be your dad?Senior Lifestyle Blog Editor, The Huffington PostThe Openly Secular coalition hopes to eliminate the social costs of coming forward. It is lamentable that people fear they are risking their jobs, businesses and personal relationships, simply through being true to who they are.Biologist and writerExecutive Director of the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and ScienceWhere do you start piecing together your ancestor\u0027s experiences in World War II? Military service records can be a remarkably rich source of information, full of intricate insights and surprising details about the life of your own veteran relative.Alphonse Fletcher University Professor and Director of the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research at Harvard UniversityFamily Historian at Ancestry.comWe need hundreds of Zephyr Teachouts, ready to challenge straying Dems -- whenever and wherever they break their campaign promises, shift their allegiances to the corporate \"dark side,\" or forget to \"dance with the ones who brought \u0027em.\" You can call that \"civil war\" if you like. I prefer the term \"democracy.\"Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourThe mantra is everywhere: a college education is the only way to climb out of poverty and create a better life. For-profit schools allow Wall Street investors and corporate executives to cash in on this faith.Writer, documentary filmmakerMother, activist, assistant professor of anthropology at UCLAThe American Dream has always been defined by upward mobility, but for black Americans, it\u0027s harder to get into the middle class, and a middle-class lifestyle is more precarious.WriterWe know from hard research that literate populations have lower poverty rates, are more peaceful and add to the global economy. Therefore, the best way to create a more peaceful and prosperous world is to educate these children.Making the Impossible PossibleOf all the pro-legalization arguments, this could perhaps be the strongest one. The laws don\u0027t work.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comHouse Republicans have not only stymied congressional action to stop dangerous climate change by opposing every forward-thinking policy, but they have repeatedly tried to roll back the landmark Clean Air Act, which enabled President Obama to put forward an executive branch Climate Action Plan.U.S. Senator from CaliforniaIn a speech that was supposedly aimed at promoting Turkey\u0027s interests, Erdogan came off as a defensive and suspicious man, who sees conspiracies everywhere and feels misunderstood by everybody and thinks he is threatened from all sides.Author and Fellow at the Century FoundationRhetoric on the Korean peninsula is not the whole reality. For over a decade, one project has shown how both Koreas can cooperate to their mutual gain. The joint venture Kaesong Industrial Complex (KIC), a short drive from Seoul just across the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), has weathered many storms.Chairman and CEO of the JoongAng Media NetworkHiking DHS\u0027s budget would be rewarding abject failure. Instead, the Congress should demand that the department get its act together or be dismembered.Senior Fellow and Director of the Center on Peace \u0026 Liberty, The Independent InstituteAs we marched together with our signs, t-shirts and battle cries, we called on politicians and regular people alike to stand up for our planet. Climate change is no longer a political issue, it is a people issue. And we\u0027re all in this together.Huffington Post Associate Lifestyle EditorMy oldest son is now in the fourth grade, and he\u0027s never had an incident of anti-gay bullying at school. And that may have lulled me into a false sense of security, because I was caught totally off guard when it happened to his little brother.Mother, wife, breadwinnerSeventeen states have introduced measures addressing backlogs. What about the others? Has your state or city take any action? Does your police department even know how many untested kits exist?Feminist, writer, and satirist (not always in that order)How can we say we\u0027re for family values when so many women in the United States have to jeopardize their livelihood to take a few weeks off from work after giving birth? Should a man have to sacrifice his economic security to take care of his sick mother or his wife returning wounded from active duty?U.S. Secretary of LaborAs we mark the end of another year with the advent of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, we pause to take stock of the year that has passed, to learn from ourselves, our experiences and our mistakes as we move forward to build a better future.National Director, Anti-Defamation LeagueThe academic crisis is even more dire than Iraq in war-torn Syria, where universities have been occupied or destroyed and thousands of students and professors have been displaced, threatened, or killed.President and Chief Executive Officer, Institute of International EducationPresident of the Portuguese Republic (1996-2006)Obama is backing away from a policy he says he will enact anyway, and he\u0027s telling voters openly that he\u0027s timing it for political reasons. If he\u0027s behind the policy, he should enact it and let the voters decide.Editor, Latino VoicesThe bottom line is clear: Climate change is a reality, and it is having a real impact. While the need for a response is urgent in communities across the country, our leaders in Washington have failed to find a way past partisan gridlock and get something done.Attorney General for New York StateWhat Boeing is doing represents a seismic shift in health care financing and delivery that potentially will have more far-reaching effects than Obamacare, primarily because it is coming from the private sector, not the government.Author, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgThe payoff of enjoying a meal in the company of a dozen or two friends is always worth it.food52.comFrom Rio to Paris to Istanbul to Durban to Seoul, city mayors are already making great progress in reducing greenhouse-gas emissions and minimizing climate risks.Mayor of ParisPremière Adjointe au Maire de ParisMayor of Seoul, South KoreaEarly Friday morning, in the quiet of his home office, Brian Curin will power up his laptop, click open a special folder and launch a file called \"My Life.\" Then he will watch the images and hear the words that his wife and three daughters thankfully have never seen or heard.CEO, American Heart AssociationGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"BOMBS AWAY IN SYRIA",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
