{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Foreign Policy Analyst, Cato InstituteHow many more American soldiers and innocent Afghan civilians have to die before the Obama administration withdraws from Afghanistan? The burning of Quran at a U.S. base outside of Kabul and the riots that followed might jeopardize the U.S. training mission in Afghanistan.
