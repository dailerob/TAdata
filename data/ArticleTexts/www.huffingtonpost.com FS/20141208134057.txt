{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Greetings from India, where I\u0027m thrilled to announce we\u0027re launching our latest international edition, in collaboration with The Times of India Group and its digital arm, Times Internet (TIL). Beyond its 1.24 billion people, India is vast in every way -- its history, its colors, its food, its spiritual traditions, the billions of stories of its people, its contradictions. And without question India is facing huge and unique challenges -- from poverty and sanitation to sexual violence and endemic corruption. But India has unique resources to meet all these challenges. It\u0027s in looking back to its ancient traditions that have been exported around the world that so much of the wisdom and strength needed to build the future will be found. And I\u0027m thrilled that HuffPost India will be there to chronicle this story and -- just as important -- help Indians tell their stories themselves.You can think of many adjectives to describe The Huffington Post and it almost always will be accurate for India as well -- vibrant, diverse, feisty, inclusive, wise and fun.Editor-in-Chief, HuffPost IndiaSo here we are, approaching Christmas 2014. Racism still taints the American dream. And unlike, say, in 1964 when there was a sense of a movement on the march with history on its side, it is hard to summon up optimism.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Until we engage with all sides, no matter how regressive their attitude, we will never make a breakthrough in attitudes towards women.Bestselling English language novelist in IndiaNo president in our nation\u0027s history has ever been castigated, condemned, mocked, insulted, derided, and degraded on a scale even close to the constantly ugly attacks on President Obama. From the day he assumed office -- indeed, even before he assumed office -- he was subjected to unprecedented insults in often the most hateful terms.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoIf you\u0027re like I used to be, you\u0027re skeptical that you\u0027ll actually make the lasting changes needed to get the health you desire. I know exactly how you feel. I\u0027ve jumped on the \"I\u0027m going to get healthy\" train more times than I\u0027d like to admit.Naturopathic Physician and VIRTUAL Health Consultant at www.DrDeborah.comIt is CEOs, not the working poor, who deserve public scorn for their dependence on government handouts. The parable of Charles Dickens\u0027 \"A Christmas Carol\" springs to mind.International President, United SteelworkersAstute diplomatic symbolism aside, the larger question is which Bhagavad Gita will prevail during the Modi Raj. The Prime Minister\u0027s personal background leads back to the Gita of RSS founder Hedgewar, who read the work as a conservative, exclusivist, Hindu work.Professor, Bard College. Author, The Bhagavad Gita: A Biography (2014).A whole two years after the shocking Delhi gang rape, why have things not changed? If even such a horrific act could not change the situation, what will it take for India to adjust its attitude towards its women?Representative at UNFPA KenyaThe tragedy of Ferguson has certainly generated a national conversation about race, about the over-militarization of local police departments, about the excessive use of force and about the prosecutor\u0027s abuse of the notoriously unfair Grand Jury system.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Dear Ava, take your own journey and find a solution for the things that hold you back. Find your own weapon and don\u0027t forget to chase your dreams. Who says the world is safe and will be safe? But if you live like you own it, you will.Acclaimed ActorOur job is not done with putting them in great schools. Ours is an ongoing job of keeping the dialogue open, of sensitizing the children towards the other gender, of discussing our own feelings towards any form of violation that we might have faced or seen.Lecturer in PsychologyAs people begin to question the integrity of the Rolling Stone journalist who broke the UVA rape story, the veracity of the survivor, and whether this whole issue should ever have been raised in the first place, there are many lessons we can all learn as this story continues to unfold. We need to stand together against sexual violence.President of One in Four, Professor at Oklahoma State UniversityWe need a bold inter-racial movement to demand social justice for all of America\u0027s sons and daughters. That movement is already underway.E.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeAfter white cops kill three black suspects, two grand juries seem steered to no charges. What\u0027s different now are huge, national non-violent protests involving tens of thousands yet no demonstrator deaths, unlike \u002760s race riots. Could this actually be a \"teachable moment\" leading to change? Maybe yes, Matalin and Reagan agree.If you\u0027re in need of a little pick-me-up, these soul-satisfying soups are just the ticket. You can make this smoky chickpea lentil soup with ingredients you likely have on hand -- and it\u0027s ready in 30 minutes yet tastes like you spent all day in the kitchen.Once Upon a ChefOne might think that, by turning Martin Luther King, Jr., into a cultural icon and electing a black president, America has bid farewell to its racist past. Recent events in Ferguson, MO, New York, and Phoenix, however, blow holes in that fantasy.Former NASA researcher; Emeritus Professor of Mathematics, James Madison UniversitySometimes childhood experiences motivate a lifetime of extraordinary work. That is certainly true for Georgetown University Law School professor and bioethicist Patricia King, a brilliant scholar and one of the most effective leaders you may not know.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundWhile any one month\u0027s results from these \"high-frequency\" data should be taken with a grain of salt, I saw no obvious anomalies in the payroll data. Job growth was robust across industries, with almost 70 percent of private industries expanding.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThe deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner are just a set of recent examples that have surfaced in large part due to our advances in technology. Let us take this opportunity to embrace what unites us, instead of focusing on what makes us different. Only then, will we be able to move our country forward.Founder, Latino GiantThe night Darren Wilson walked away from an indictment in the shooting death of Michael Brown, I was banned from one of my favorite social-media groups, a group for gay dads. It seems that this group was not the place to talk about race, policing and what happened in Ferguson.Nonprofit consultant, college professor, LGBTQ activist, dad \u0026 husbandWhen I hear of black and Latino men being stopped, being searched, being harassed, being beaten, being shot, being killed, I never think, well, this has nothing to do with race. The very idea that somehow, of all areas of life, this is the one where race does not enter, makes me shake with anger. It\u0027s always about race.Associate Professor of English at the University of North Carolina, Greensboro; Fellow, Hutchins Center for African and African American Research, Harvard UniversityWe are not taking urgent action. Nature does not negotiate, it responds to our intransigence. For the people of the Philippines, and in many other parts of the world, climate change is already a catastrophe.Executive Director, Greenpeace InternationalIt is unimportant whether we agree with the decision of the grand jury or the juries of future trials and the actions of special investigations. The United States is a nation of laws, and the grand jury has spoken for now. We need to move forward in a peaceful, thoughtful and lawful manner.AuthorWhile you may know the basics to sticking within your budget -- not overdoing it with over-the-top florals or spending 40 percent of your total budget on a dress, for example -- there are some less obvious ways that you may be racking up costs without even realizing it.Only time will tell if the UN Refugee Agency\u0027s critical efforts will have the potency and persuasion to effect systemic change among these communities, but during these 16 Days of Activism we\u0027re thankful for every effort that combats this violence perpetuated against the world\u0027s most innocent and vulnerable populations.There\u0027s no wrong way to be a woman.Is it merely a coincidence that states are passing voter identification laws that disproportionately impact Latino voter turnout, at precisely the moment at which the Latino vote is growing more influential?The NCLR Action Fund works to empower the Latino community nationwide.We can talk all we want about provocation and perception. About chokeholds and grand juries. About the militarization of the police. But I want to talk about hopelessness. The criminal justice system is broken, and broken in a way that has harmed communities of color much more than other communities.Chair, Department of Justice Studies, Montclair State UniversityEach writer I know offers an open door into their extended world, full of their most treasured ideas and images. Writers share what they find most valuable. In that spirit, I\u0027m sharing 10 great books with you and paying it forward for the writers -- and artists -- who have created them.Professor of Art and Art History, Mt. San Jacinto CollegeI didn\u0027t understand why my parents didn\u0027t spend money -- and why they never let themselves live a little or take a break from the never-ending quest to save that last dollar. By the time I left for college, I was tired of feeling embarrassed about money, and vowed that I\u0027d finally live the life I thought I deserved as an adult.LearnVest is a program for your money.The struggling partners I work with have often slipped into these destructive patterns without even realizing it. Had they been able to see them earlier, they could have stopped the damage they had wreaked.Clinical psychologist and marriage counselor for over 40 years, founder of heroiclove.comGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"NAMASTE",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
