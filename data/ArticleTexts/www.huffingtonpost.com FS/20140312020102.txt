{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonWhy have we made exercising -- at least the way we do it in the places that have come to be known as \"health clubs\" -- such an awful experience? It\u0027s a question I had time to mull recently on my 14-hour plane ride back from Seoul, where I was for the launch of HuffPost Korea. While I was there I was amazed at their practice of Kouksundo -- a practice that combines meditation, breathing and martial arts and has been shown to boost productivity and reduce anxiety and stress -- which is so different from how we approach fitness in America\u0027s temples of physical well-being, populated by people who often seem miserable, joylessly going through the strenuous motions so they can check off the exercise box on that day\u0027s to-do list and get the heck out of there. If we\u0027re going to redefine success to include well-being, we also need to redefine getting in shape to include mental and soul fitness.CommentsDean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027The most obvious way in which to make budget numbers understandable is to express them as a share of the total budget. All the reporters at the major news outlets know how to do simple division with a calculator. Why would news outlets not take a trivial step that would make their material much more informative to their audience?CommentsDavid BromwichProfessor of Literature, Yale UniversityObama entered the presidency at 47 -- an age at which people as a rule are pretty much what they are going to be. It is a piece of mystification to suppose that we have been denied a rescue that this man, under happier circumstances, would have been well equipped to perform. There have been a few genuine shocks. But the truth is that Obama\u0027s convictions were never strong.Comments (274)Diane RavitchResearch Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027There is no evidence from any other nation that replacing a public system with a privatized choice system produces anything but social, economic, and racial segregation.Comments (173)Noah MichelsonExecutive Editor, HuffPost Gay VoicesIn honor of my dad, Robert Michelson, one of the most incredible men who ever spent a little time on this planet -- and in honor of the pain and grief and wonder conjured by death -- I am sharing five things that I learned while helping him die.Comments (81)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkNo longer can we ignore the reality that our children are dying. No longer can we close our eyes to the immense pain and suffering of these grieving parents, siblings and loved ones. No longer can we act as if this doesn\u0027t impact us.CommentsK. Ford K.Author, \u0027The Wife of John the Baptist\u0027I began to feel I had slipped so low that I was no longer respected. I lost self confidence. I stopped talking about my writing. Soon nobody knew that I was a writer or that I\u0027d ever gone to college. Nobody knew me. I became invisible.Comments (48)Rashard MendenhallNFL Running Back, Arizona CardinalsI\u0027ve greatly enjoyed my time, but I no longer wish to put my body at risk for the sake of entertainment. I think about the rest of my life and I want to live it with much quality. And physically, I am grateful that I can walk away feeling as good as I did when I stepped into it.Comments (299)Tomoko NaganoEditor at Large, The Huffington Post JapanNature is desperately trying to survive and return to its original state. The animals disappeared when they lost their ecosystem, but now, after three years of struggling to rebuild it, they are starting to recover their way of life.CommentsRalph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorIs it the job of members of Congress to serve the interests of their corporate pay masters or to support the working class of 30 million Americans whose wages have failed to keep up with inflation as corporate profits and bosses pay have soared?Comments (24)Rabbi Michael LernerEditor, Tikkun MagazineJohn Kerry\u0027s plan will fail because it will be \"realistic\" rather than visionary, and de facto that means speaking more to the power of Israel and its domestic lobby than to the aspirations of the Palestinian people.CommentsAdam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911As highlighted by the recent news that two stolen passports were used by passengers aboard the missing Malaysia Airlines flight, your passport might well have as much, if not more, value to criminals here and abroad precisely because they are so difficult to obtain and increasingly hard to counterfeit.CommentsEllie KrupnickSenior Editor of Viral Content and Strategy, The Huffington PostSuddenly, like revelation at Sinai, Shabbat started to make perfect sense. Those 25 hours became a respite from my mounting schoolwork, a forced hiatus from the endless black hole of the Internet, the only time I could turn off a screen long enough to, say, play a game with my family.CommentsHerbert LuiMarketing Expert; AuthorThe realms of relationships, politics, and conflicts pour into our daily lives. Each is also related to war. Similarly, the business world is built on war principles, hence the terms \"campaign\" and \"strategy.\"CommentsPatrick SmithAirline pilot, air travel columnist and authorAll we know for sure is that a plane went down with no warning or communication from the crew. That the crash did not happen during takeoff or landing -- the phases of flight when most accident occur -- somewhat limits the possibilities, but numerous possibilities remain.Comments (18)Rebecca SolnitAuthor, \u0027A Paradise Built in Hell\u0027Our climate crisis requires us to evacuate our normal ways of doing things. That will not always be cheap or easy, but divestment can be done now with no loss, even possibly with an upside, say many financial analysts.CommentsJay ScottCo-Executive Director, Alex’s Lemonade Stand FoundationIn the end, we are all human beings, and we owe it to these children to share this potentially lifesaving drug. No matter the obstacles in the way, when a child\u0027s life is on the line, you do what you have to.CommentsUnveiling Afghanistan“The Unheard Voices of Progress” is a campaign by openasia.org and fidh.org\"Our society is a very traditional one, where not only men are against women, but women are even against themselves. Illiteracy is an extremely important factor, as is the lack of a legal system that can adequately deal with discrimination and exclusion.\"CommentsDr. F. Emelia SamA soul-centered scribe at heart, Author \u0027I Haven\u0027t Found Myself\u0027, Oral \u0026 Maxillofacial surgery side gigThe old paradigm of \"there\u0027s only room for one\" continues to be broken down. We still have a way to go, but it is up to us to create room for the next woman -- not elbow her out of the way.Comments (21)Kerry O\u0027BrienComedy writer in New York CityI randomly ducked into the Bank of America for a place to cry today and I am very happy I did. The ATM line was luckily very long so I hopped in and cried until it was my turn to use the machine (about 6 minutes). A very average, basic, no-frills, in and out place to cry.CommentsRyan SeacrestTV Personality and ProducerFrom young students to fans, and from veteran music label executives to the artists who have graced the GRAMMY stage, there were inspirational music educators in our lives who ignited our passion. This is our chance to give back.CommentsRobert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Obama is being branded a populist by the establishment press and irresponsible by Republicans for what is really a very tame program. He should at least earn these adjectives and get the public\u0027s attention.Comments (73)Sara GatesTrends Editor, The Huffington PostWhen something is too good to be true, it probably is. I know you\u0027ve probably heard that before, but no words could be truer -- especially when it comes to renting in New York.CommentsWray HerbertAuthor, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027In AA and other recovery programs, willpower is an unreliable tool for abstinence. Effortful self-regulation can and does fail us, and such failures can leave us vulnerable to impatient decision making. A better alternative can be seen in another practice well known in the rooms of recovery -- the gratitude list.CommentsMichael BrennerSenior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghIt is highly unlikely that the Western governments will seek to use energy commerce with Russia as an instrument of leverage with Russia. The cost-benefit calculations that lead to devalue that tactic conceivably could change were the crisis to deepen.CommentsMatt WalshBlogger, talk radio host, father of twinsIt causes me actual, real pain when I run into young people afraid of risks -- afraid to strike out on their own because it \"might not work out.\" Might not work out? Of course it won\u0027t \"work out\" at first. That\u0027s part of the fun. OK, maybe not fun, per se. But it\u0027s part of the adventure.Comments (51)Amanda DubermanNews Editor, HuffPost WomenThat researchers and health advocates need to presume harsh judgment of sexually active women to convince skeptics of birth control\u0027s utility just reminds us how far we have to go.Comments (248)Stuart GunterTeacher, North Branch School in Afton, VAIs this what education is -- a way to make more money off of our children? Is this the drive of education in America? What happened to the democratic ideal of education creating an informed citizenry?Comments (90)Anne LoehrWriter and \"Generational Guru\"There are big changes coming to the American workforce. While many organizations are watching the economy, there\u0027s another change -- almost a revolution -- quietly taking place right under our noses.CommentsPierce BrosnanActorMust whales and dolphins be subjected to deafening noise that will cause more than 3.5 million instances of temporary and/or permanent hearing loss?Comments (15)Susan Blumenthal, M.D.Public Health Editor, The Huffington Post; Former U.S. Assistant Surgeon GeneralLet\u0027s commit to rectifying the longstanding inequities in research, clinical practice, and the health care system so that women can someday live in an America and in a world without HIV/AIDS.CommentsIan Altman, 2014.11.03Peter Getty, 2014.11.03Jay Weston, 2014.11.03Clayton Anderson, 2014.11.03William Bradley, 2014.11.03Pablo Freund, 2014.11.03LearnVest, 2014.11.03Edward Goldman, 2014.11.03Bernard-Henri Lévy, 2014.11.03James Scarborough, 2014.11.03Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"4.2 MILLION",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
