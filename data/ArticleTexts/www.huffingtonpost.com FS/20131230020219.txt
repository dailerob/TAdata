{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonWith Christmas in the rear view mirror, and New Year\u0027s just up ahead, it\u0027s the perfect time to reflect on the year gone by, and thank everyone in the HuffPost community for helping make 2013 such a record-shattering year for us. Last month, HuffPost attracted 94 million unique visitors, with nearly 45 percent of that traffic coming from our eight international editions (with Brazil and Korea joining the fold in the next two months). HuffPost Live continues to make news and attract views -- nearly 110 million in November, and over 750 million since it launched. And our Third Metric initiative -- devoted to redefining success beyond money and power to include well-being, wisdom, wonder and giving -- has taken off across the globe in a remarkable way. Clearly 2013 was a year in which many of us felt the need to bring more mindfulness into our lives and reconnect with what really matters -- a perfect New Year\u0027s resolution for 2014.Comments (13)Gary HartUnited States Senator (Ret.)Safe landings are not news; crashes are news. But we must not be left without hope. For many of us, however, what makes life worthwhile is to focus on safe landings and those who make a difference every day, every year.CommentsKaren PapernoOwner, Boing BoingMine has become a neighborhood of excess and ease while I have sunk into poverty. Here I am, the owner of a shop in the epicenter of the baby universe, and I can\u0027t make my rent. I just want people to know how some of us are hiding in plain sight, serving you with a smile while our gut lurches with hunger and anxiety.Comments (204)Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoAfter examining the evidence provided by the NSA, the Review Group concluded that the information obtained through the section 215 telephony meta-data program had not proved necessary to the prevention of any planned terrorist attack since the program\u0027s inception in 2006.Comments (47)Arianna HuffingtonDuring a time when \"twerking\" eclipsed coverage of the war in Syria, and our government literally stopped working over the Affordable Care Act, we wanted to tap into the power of photographs to tell the stories and illustrate both the important and the absurd.CommentsDavid Katz, M.D.Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterResolutions, born of a \"ready or not, let\u0027s go\" mentality, invite failure. So reinvent your resolutions and make them more likely to succeed. Resolve to get ready, and go only when you are.CommentsDiane RavitchHistorian, NYU professorWhen I go with my partner to midnight Mass, I am glad I know the words to the songs. I look around and am not surprised to see a fairly large number of other Jews from the neighborhood, also joining in singing the songs with the choir. It is Christmas. It is a time to celebrate peace and joy and goodwill towards all. We can all share those hopes.Comments (82)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundMost Americans are wrapping up their holiday celebrations and pondering the promise of 2014. But millions of Americans who have been struggling the longest to find work in our slowly recovering economy are now facing deep uncertainty and despair instead of a Happy New Year.Comments (77)Bill GeorgeProfessor of Management Practice, Harvard Business SchoolThe latest announcement from the White House on Thursday, December 19, seems to indicate that even President Obama is backing away from Obamacare. At the very least, he is bobbing and weaving like an exhausted prize fighter trying to avoid a knockout punch.Comments (277)Rep. Debbie Wasserman SchultzAuthor, \u0027For the Next Generation\u0027; Chair, Democratic National CommitteeThe Republican party\u0027s government shutdown that lasted 16 days and cost the economy $24 billion offered a clear illustration of the dysfunction in Washington. But it doesn\u0027t have to be that way.Comments (90)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarDespite great strides made in 2013, there are a few things on the wish list for 2014: equal pay, for one. But also mentors, the end of a need for gender quotas, and balance, however you choose to define it.CommentsPadmini ParthasarathyJournalist based in New York, NYI was raised an American Hindu who feels more nostalgia for December pine in New York than October sulfur in Mumbai. I didn\u0027t think I would see a Christmas tree this year. And this one was startlingly alive, outside, swaying between private mourning and public celebration.CommentsDevon CornealMother, writer, lawyerHe\u0027s so innocent and I\u0027m so jaded and I want to preserve this curiosity and openness forever, but I can\u0027t. He thinks I know the answers.CommentsSusannah LewisFreelance writer, blogger, aspiring best-selling author, wife, momI didn\u0027t want to go to Walmart that day, but I went. I didn\u0027t want to give the lady my kids\u0027 toys, but I did. Sometimes doing what we don\u0027t want to do is exactly what we\u0027re supposed to do.Comments (37)Thomas E. PerezU.S. Secretary of LaborNew Year\u0027s is supposed to be a time of excitement and new beginnings, but for too many people, it will be a time of desperation.Comments (42)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistOne of the many reasons I love living in New York is that we get a front row seat to the innumerable thrills that take place here -- from conventions and awards shows, to parades and U.N. assemblies. But my favorite New York tradition is the annual New Year\u0027s Eve ball-drop on Times Square. All around the globe, people are counting down in thousands of different languages as we bid goodbye to the departing year.CommentsWhitney CaudillAssociate Dean, Manchester University \u0026 Blogger, It is pretty.Needless to say, it is easy to focus on the negatives of being single at the holidays. But the truth is that it isn\u0027t all bad. In fact, I believe there is a strong argument that it is better, or at least more fun, to be single during the holidays.Comments (21)Christine PelosiChair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusWithout voting rights, our struggle for women\u0027s rights, civil rights, LGBT rights, immigrants\u0027 rights and workers\u0027 rights is just a conversation. We know that a handful of voter fraud cases have been used to silence millions of voices and we must change that.Comments (129)Mark C. MillerHumoristSay you arrive one day for an important job interview, but find there\u0027s no job, no interviewer and no office. Instead, as soon as you open the door, you find festive balloons and 20 people in an apartment shouting to you, \"Welcome to your new home!\"Comments (44)Noah MichelsonEditor, HuffPost Gay VoicesYou can say whatever you want, including gay people are \"sinful\" and full of \"murder, envy, strife, hatred\" and are in the same league as those who enjoy being penetrated by barnyard animals and...Comments (1,767)Janet TavakoliPresident, Tavakoli Structured FinanceSince our city leaders love to tout statistics to tell us crime is down, then let\u0027s see if their statistics stand up to a basic test from additional statistics.CommentsIsiah ThomasNBA Hall of FamerWe owe it to our children and ourselves to demand higher expectations and a system where all stakeholders, from the state house to the school house are held accountable when it comes to education.Comments (29)Bob BurnettBerkeley writer, retired Silicon Valley executiveIn 2013 there was a resurgence of populism in the U.S., with the enormous popularity of Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and the victory of Bill de Blasio in the New York mayor\u0027s race. And populists gained a powerful ally in Pope Francis.CommentsJes BakerBlogger, The Militant BakerYou\u0027re allowed to fall in love with yourself. I promise. This will be the scariest thing you will ever do, and that\u0027s okay. It will also be the most amazing (albeit super gradual) experience you will ever have.Comments (611)Russell SimmonsFounder, GlobalGrind.comWith only a few days left in the legislative session, we urgently need Governor Cuomo to sign a game-changing bill that gives local governments and citizens more ability to regulate puppy mills in their communities.CommentsRebecca SolnitAuthor, \u0027A Paradise Built in Hell\u0027I don\u0027t know what\u0027s coming. I do know that, whatever it is, some of it will be terrible, but some of it will be miraculous, that term we reserve for the utterly unanticipated, the seeds we didn\u0027t know the soil held. And I know that we don\u0027t know what we do does.CommentsChris KellyWriter, \u0027Real Time with Bill Maher\u0027I\u0027m a busy man, and I like my news in 50-to-100-word chunks, like fragments of Sappho. So I couldn\u0027t get by without the news aggregation site Newser.CommentsTEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"At first glance, a choir may seem like nothing more than a group of singers. But look a little closer. Conductor Eric Whitacre\u0027s performers don\u0027t simply sing. They remind us of what it means to be truly connected.Comments (33)Mike RyanSenior Entertainment Writer, The Huffington PostIt almost feels like more than just four months separated the two seasons that comprised the year, because watching clips from early 2013 is so different from what aired over the last few months.CommentsRichard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureLocal politicians are taking on the big banks. Candidates for major office are adopting populist themes. But it starts at the bottom, not the top, with activists who engage with and crystallize the public\u0027s desire for justice.CommentsRana FloridaCEO, The Creative Class Group \u0026 Author, UpgradeFrom silver streamers to Champagne towers, from winter picnics to royal recipes, you can throw a New Year\u0027s party with a vibe that\u0027s black tie formal, fun, and laid-back, all at the same time.CommentsRichard (RJ) Eskow, 2013.29.12Steven Strauss, 2013.29.12Lauren Lyons, 2013.29.12Nicole Cothrun Venables, 2013.29.12Marta Ibarrondo, 2013.29.12Robert Naiman, 2013.29.12Megan Davies Mennes, 2013.29.12Jen Singer, 2013.29.12Carine Fabius, 2013.29.12Whitney Bradley, 2013.29.12Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"SURGE: DECEMBER SIGNUPS NEAR 1 MILLION",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BizYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
