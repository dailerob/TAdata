{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week saw the first presidential debate. The main topic was the economy, but we heard more about Big Bird than jobs or the foreclosure crisis. Also missing: President Obama, who was more present on stage with Eastwood in Tampa than with Romney in Denver. It wasn\u0027t a bad metaphor for the last three years: one side lying about tax cuts and deficits, the other defensive and unwilling to fight for its own job-creating policies. The election narrative shifted again on Friday when the latest jobs report showed a drop in unemployment to 7.8 percent. Republicans screamed fraud, with no basis in reality. But lest we pop the champagne too soon, remember that at the present rate of 114,000 jobs added a month, it would take over a decade to reach full employment. A celebration based on such meager numbers underscores just how badly we need a real debate on the economy.Read Post | Comments (224)Bob Herbert, 10/04/12Former New York Times columnistIt\u0027s time to stop making excuses for Barack Obama. With so much at stake in this election, his performance at the debate on Wednesday night was indefensible.Read Post | Comments (3,020)Howard Fineman, 10/04/12Editorial Director, Huffington Post Media GroupThe president needs to get back some form of his old magic if he hopes to secure a victory that, until the Denver debate, seemed all but inevitable, even to many of his foes.Read Post | Comments (3,499)Arianna Huffington, 10/02/12Now, a well-placed debate zinger certainly has its place -- but how much more of a \"moment\" would be created if either candidate instead unleashed a series of proposals to put the 20 million Americans who are unemployed or underemployed back to work?Read Post | Comments (524)Robert Redford, 10/03/12Actor, director, and environmental activistI\u0027m fairly sure Mitt Romney thinks he has an ace in the hole by using the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline against President Obama.

Perhaps then, they might inspire the rest of the country to throw the death penalty in the dust bin where it belongs.Read Post | Comments (450)Patricia Cornwell, 10/02/12If President Obama is reelected, and I hope he is, maybe he should take a close look at those his administration appoints to serve the public objectively and without conflict or unseemly allegiances. And maybe it\u0027s time to hold financial institutions accountable for their greed and questionable practices.Read Post | Comments (205)Jimmy Carter, 10/01/1239th president of the United StatesThe act of building, of renovating, of coming together cements a bond not easily undone.
