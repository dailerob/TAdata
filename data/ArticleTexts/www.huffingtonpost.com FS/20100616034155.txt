{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"I am really not entirely sure what the point to this Oval Office address was! Were you looking for something that resembled a fully-realized action plan, describing a detailed approach to containment and clean up? Or perhaps a definitive statement, severing the command and control that BP has largely enjoyed, in favor of a structured, centralized federal response? Maybe you were looking for a roadmap-slash-timetable for putting America on a path to a clean energy future? Well, this speech was none of those things. Here\u0027s what we learned, instead: there was a huge oil spill, did you hear?Read Post | CommentsPaul Helmke, 06.15.2010President, Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun ViolenceUnder H.R. 5175, every other group would have to report names of people who donate at least $600 for election activities. Every. Other. Group -- the Sierra Club, the AFL-CIO -- except the NRA.Read Post | CommentsJoseph A. Palermo, 06.15.2010Author/Associate Professor of HistoryObama\u0027s talk tonight was dominated by a technocratic laundry list of actions he plans to take. We\u0027ve heard it all before. Obama should have made it clear tonight that the coddling of BP is over.Read Post | CommentsBill Maher, 06.15.2010Host of HBO\u0027s \"Real Time with Bill Maher\"Read Post | CommentsDylan Loewe, 06.14.2010Speechwriter, AuthorIn the months to come you will continue to hear about 2010 as a Republican year. But over the last few weeks, the political landscape has started to shift in ways that may completely upend the conventional wisdom.Read Post | CommentsChristine Pelosi, 06.15.2010Campaign Boot Camp author: California DNC MemberEvery gallon of fossil fuels polluting the gulf is evidence to me that the US should ditch the income tax to instead \"tax what we burn not what we earn.\" Replacing the income tax with a carbon tax would be the moonshot of our generation.Read Post | CommentsTrey Ellis, 06.15.2010Novelist, Screenwriter, and Assistant Professor at Columbia UniversityThe cynicism and malaise that plagued the country during the Bush years went utterly into remission when Obama was elected, but it\u0027s now back in our bones. We need the medicine that cured it the first time. Inspiration from a leader.Read Post | CommentsAndrew Winston, 06.15.2010Environmental Strategist, author of Green Recovery, co-author, Green to GoldTonight\u0027s speech was a real disappointment. How could Obama not use this opportunity to call on us to do some hard things? What\u0027s scary about the speech is that it almost could have been any president in the last four decades.Read Post | CommentsHarry Shearer, 06.15.2010Investigative satiristHow many BP shareholders complained to management about the policies and practices from which they benefited all these years?Read Post | CommentsLeo Hindery, Jr., 06.15.2010Chairman, U.S. Economy/Smart Globalization Initiative at the New America FoundationChina could be on the cusp of a new movement that markedly improves the lives of its workers, or the world could see this movement wither through a lack of organizing expertise or because of government crackdown. It\u0027s the moment of truth.Read Post | CommentsScott Mendelson, 06.15.2010Film Critic and Pundit for Salon, Huffington Post, and Mendelson\u0027s MemosListen people, we are not in a summer box office slump. In other words, come this Friday, to quote the last true mid-June giant, \"Now... the real game begins now.\"Read Post | CommentsDoug Kendall, 06.15.2010Founder and President of Constitutional Accountability CenterAs every fifth-grader knows, our Founding Fathers rebelled against the British tea taxes primarily because the taxes were imposed upon the colonies without any representation in the British Parliament.Read Post | CommentsJesse Kornbluth, 06.15.2010Editor of HeadButler.comIt took almost 40 years. And an investigation that took 12 years, cost $280 million and filled 5,000 pages. But now, at last, we know what happened on Bloody Sunday.Read Post | CommentsLynda Resnick, 06.15.2010Author, Rubies in the OrchardGiven school cafeteria menus, it\u0027s no wonder that our nation\u0027s children are developing poor eating habits. As places of learning, schools have a responsibility to also educate on nutrition.Read Post | CommentsDave Johnson, 06.15.2010Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureRead Post | CommentsRobert Reich, 06.14.2010Former Secretary of Labor, Professor at BerkeleyUnless or until BP\u0027s shareholders are forced by law to part with their assets to ensure the safety of the American public, shareholder interests will come first in the Gulf. Not the wildlife. Not the citizens.Read Post | CommentsDean Baker, 06.14.2010Co-Director of the Center for Economic and Policy ResearchThere are no free market fundamentalists; everyone recognizes the need for a big role for government. The debate is whether we want it to serve the needs of the bulk of the population or just the purposes of the rich and powerful.Read Post | CommentsKen Dychtwald Ph.D., 06.15.2010Renowned Psychologist, Gerontologist and AuthorCan our country afford to have tens of millions of us living to 80? Or 100? Will existing pensions and entitlement programs survive long enough for us to reap even part of what we are hoping for?Read Post | CommentsRep. Ed Markey, 06.15.2010Rep. Ed Markey (D-MA), Chairman, Select Committee on Energy IndependenceBP\u0027s spill safety response plans include references to protecting walruses, which have not called the Gulf of Mexico home for 3 million years. The American people deserve oil safety plans that are ironclad and not boilerplate.Read Post | CommentsTed Marmor, 06.15.2010Professor Emeritus of Yale UniversityIt is ironic -- and infuriating -- to have a debate in 2010 about Social Security when that program had nothing to do with the transformation of the nation\u0027s fiscal policy from surplus to deficit since 2000.Read Post | CommentsRobert Creamer, 06.15.2010Political organizer, strategist and authorThe restriction on American travel to Cuba not only limits our freedom, it actually prevents the presumed goal of our policy to open up Cuba. That\u0027s just plain dumb. And the same goes for our economic \"boycott\".Read Post | CommentsPaul Abrams, 06.15.2010Entrepreneur, professional iconoclast, co-founder BreakUptheBigBanks.comWhen the rantings of his minister, Rev Wright, threatened his presidential campaign, candidate Barack Obama delivered one of the most stirring speeches in American political history. The Gulf spill now provides a repeat opportunity.Read Post | CommentsRaymond J. Learsy, 06.15.2010Scholar and author, \"Over a Barrel: Breaking Oil\u0027s Grip on Our Future\"The proceedings in the ongoing United States vs. CITGO Petroleum Corporation clearly reveal our government\u0027s abject alliance with the machinations of the OPEC cartel.Read Post | CommentsPeter Daou, 06.14.2010Political consultant, former adviser to Hillary ClintonIt looks like the Deepwater Horizon tragedy will rival or eclipse health insurance reform as one of the life-altering events of the Obama era. This, the greatest man-made environmental disaster in our history, is the mother of wake up calls.Read Post | CommentsRabbi Shmuley Boteach, 06.15.2010Rabbi and writerFollowing recent Catholic abuse reports, I pleaded to the public to let the facts emerge before disparaging the whole Church. It\u0027s a shame that this same courtesy has not been extended to Sholom Rubashkin.Read Post | CommentsChris Weigant, 06.14.2010Author, Political Commentator, and Blogger (ChrisWeigant.com)Obama was slow to react to the disaster. Luckily for him, the disaster itself is happening in slow motion as well. It is definitely not too late for Obama to lead. He can still redeem himself and his image.Read Post | CommentsMarcia DeSanctis, 2010.06.15Ken Adelman, 2010.06.15Richard Greener, 2010.06.15Daphne Eviatar, 2010.06.15Evelyn Leopold, 2010.06.15Wayne Pacelle, 2010.06.15Michael Wolff, 2010.06.15Youth Radio -- Youth Media International, 2010.06.15Andrew Winston, 2010.06.15Joseph A.
