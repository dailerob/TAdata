{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"On Monday, I spoke at a conference centered on the timely theme of \"Delivering in a Delevering World.\" \"Delevering,\" as it\u0027s traditionally used, means decreasing a company or country\u0027s leverage, usually by paying down existing debt. It is a term more likely to be heard at finance conferences than around dinner tables, but it\u0027s an idea that gets to the heart of our current economic crisis. Because the ways we pay down our debts, in life and in business, have a real influence on our ability to arrive at positive outcomes. Unfortunately, on both the political and economic level, we\u0027re being told that delevering means that we must cut, cut, cut. But smart delevering isn\u0027t just about cutting -- and the relentless emphasis on cutting has obscured the more important question of what is being cut. In far too many cases, our approach to delevering is keeping us from growing, and keeping us from tapping into all our resources.Read Post | Comments (22)Sandra Fluke, 03/22/12Public Interest Law Scholar, Georgetown University Law CenterJust as we will not be silenced when we are verbally attacked for speaking out, we will not go back to a society without the kind of health care for women that the Affordable Care Act provides.Read Post | Comments (2,127)Marlo Thomas, 03/22/12Award-winning actress, author, and activistI challenge anyone not to be moved by the video I just saw on YouTube.
