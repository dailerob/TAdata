If Day One can best be described as \"The Day The GOP Put Thurgood Marshall On Trial\" (and in fairness, it\u0027s not like they have any more \"Strom Thurmond birthday parties\" left, on which to do this), and Day Two can be rightly called \"Now You Are Just Boring Us To Tears Day,\" then this third day is shaping up to be the Day Of Viral Video Follies.Read Post | CommentsDr. Judith Rodin and Michael R.
