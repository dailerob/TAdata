{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"America was born with a great soul, a moral view of Democracy in which citizens care about their fellow citizens and join together to take responsibility not just for themselves but for each other, for America as a union, a joint enterprise. The government\u0027s job was to carry out that moral vision and to do so it created what we call The Public, the provision of basic protection and empowerment for all. The Romney-Ryan Budget is a Devil\u0027s budget. It guts The Public, America\u0027s soul -- The American Way of Life that we provide for each other.Read Post | Comments (508)Tavis Smiley, 08/22/12PBS talk show host, PRI radio hostIn this election season, how many of us are living a lie by remaining silent and static about things that should matter -- practicing a politics of convenience and cowardice, rather than a politics of courage and conviction?Read Post | Comments (93)Rep.

Breus, 08/22/12Clinical Psychologist; Board Certified Sleep SpecialistWe know that sleep has a great effect on how we eat. But does how we eat -- or more precisely, what we eat -- have an effect on our sleep? One thing we might not be talking about enough is how choosing the right foods can help strengthen sleep.Read Post | Comments (15)Lisa Turner, 08/22/12Enlightened nutrition, intuitive eating, healthy livingThere\u0027s not much you can do to stop the inexorable march of time; but you can protect your health, and age more gracefully, with the following foods:Read Post | Comments (41)Noah Michelson, 08/22/12Editor, HuffPost Gay VoicesRight-wing and evangelical pundits are ignoring one little thing: If we consider that, at the very least, straight Americans outnumber queer Americans 10 to 1, then there are many, many more straight people in this country having \"gay sex\" than there are gay people having it.Read Post | Comments (169)Marcus Samuelsson, 08/22/12Chef and authorOur country is in the midst of a cataclysmic health crisis, much of it caused by how we eat. There shouldn\u0027t be a distinction between what\u0027s healthy and unhealthy. Cooking and eating well is not just an issue of access or cost -- it\u0027s also an issue of education and understanding.Read Post | CommentsTrita Parsi, 08/22/12President, National Iranian American CouncilDespite the abysmal relations between the U.S. and Iran, Washington has on numerous occasions sent aid as well as rescue teams to Iran to help with relief work.

Boettcher, 08/22/12Award-winning filmmakerYou\u0027ll hear a lot in the next few days about how Phyllis Diller paved the way for women in comedy, but that\u0027s not how Phyllis saw herself. \"There have always been funny ladies, Steve,\" she told me when I interviewed her a few years ago.Read Post | CommentsMitchell Bard, 08/22/12Writer and FilmmakerAkin\u0027s assertion isn\u0027t problematic for Republicans because it is outrageous.
