{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"\"The struggle of man against power is the struggle of memory against forgetting.\" It\u0027s one of Milan Kundera\u0027s most famous lines, from his novel The Book of Laughter and Forgetting. It\u0027s one worth keeping in mind as we approach March 20, the 10th anniversary of one of the biggest disasters in the history of the United States. That was the day George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, and a team of others -- along with much of Washington and a very complicit mainstream media -- took the nation to war against Iraq. The devastating consequences of that war will continue for decades, but a full accounting has still yet to happen. Allowing the toxic mixture of lies, deception and rationalizations that led to that war to go unchallenged makes it more likely that we will make similar tragic mistakes in the future. So I hope we can use this moment to assess what really happened, to look back in order to look forward.Read Post | CommentsLarry King, 03/06/13Iconic television and radio interviewer, online at #LarryKingNow on @OraTVI found Hugo Chavez conflicting. In a strange way, he was extraordinarily easy to like, but of course many people -- both good and bad -- who rise to prominence can be that way. Chavez was larger than life. He was very engaging.Read Post | Comments (27)Dave Evans, 03.04.2013Chief Futurist, CiscoWe are at the cusp of a renaissance in healthcare.

By the time we launched The JobRaising Challenge on Inauguration Day, it was clear that the tradition was alive and well. And today we are pleased to announce the astonishing results: JobRaising raised over $1,500,000 to help put Americans back to work -- more than $1,200,000 of that through CrowdRise alone. And yet, the Challenge was about more than just the numbers. We were reminded that we can no longer sit by the sidelines waiting for government to act, that we can instead tap into our greatest resources -- the empathy, generosity and barn-raising spirit that have always defined us as a country.Read Post | Comments (15)Josh Klenert and Otto Toth, 03/06/13Today we\u0027re proud to release our updated version of HuffPost for Android.

She is an irreplaceable woman and there is not a day that goes by that I don\u0027t think about her. I lost my mom to colon cancer after a six-year-hard fought battle with the disease.
