{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editorial Director, AOL Huffington Post Media GroupHere in New Hampshire -- where on Thursday Mitt Romney will announce his presidential campaign -- they believe in community, as long as it is their own.

Wedel, 06.02.2011Author, \"Shadow Elite\"The goal of handing out foreign aid to foster \"civil society\" always sounds noble and well-intentioned.

Democracy is never a simple translation.Read Post | CommentsJason Linkins, 06.01.2011Editor, Eat the PressGiven his ideological track record, I\u0027m as surprised as the next guy to learn that Rand Paul now believes that certain people should be jailed for merely exercising their right to assemble under the Constitution of the United States.Read Post | CommentsScott Mendelson, 06.01.2011Film CriticThis reboot/prequel is a genuine triumph.
