{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"When Kenny Lerer and I co-founded The Huffington Post in May 2005, we had high hopes. But even we would have been hard put to predict that less than six years later we would be able to announce a deal that now makes it possible for us to execute our vision at light speed. AOL is an online pioneer that engenders great trust among its 250 million global users. HuffPost is on the cutting edge of creating news that is social and brings with it a distinctive voice and a highly engaged audience. In this case, 1 + 1 \u003d 11. Far from changing our editorial approach, our culture, or our mission, this moment will be, for HuffPost, like stepping off a fast-moving train and onto a supersonic jet. We\u0027re still traveling toward the same destination, with the same people at the wheel, and with the same goals, but we\u0027re now going to get there much, much faster.Read Post | Comments (678)Howard Fineman, 02.07.2011If the 21st century is about \"self-determination\" - and I think it is - then we all need to be actively informed and engaged.

Egypt provides a case in point.Read Post | CommentsJim Moret, 02.05.2011Chief Correspondent, Inside Edition; Attorney; Author, The Last Day of My LifeApparently, and perhaps soon legally, Sarah Palin and Bristol Palin will have no substitutes.
