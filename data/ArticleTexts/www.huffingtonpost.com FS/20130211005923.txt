{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, as Nemo barreled up the Northeast coast, a different storm hit Washington, centered on Congressional oversight of the lethal use of drones. Given how little official concern there was about the issue during Obama\u0027s first term, this tempest was a welcome development. The long overdue debate was occasioned by the leak of a memo detailing the administration\u0027s legal justification for drone strikes, and the confirmation hearings for CIA director nominee John Brennan -- the president\u0027s frequent \"kill list\" co-author. With the memo\u0027s legal reasoning even broader than suspected, Congress is considering setting up special courts, like those currently used for authorizing domestic surveillance, making it at least as hard for the government to kill suspected terrorists -- including American citizens -- by remote control as listen to their phone conversations. Let\u0027s hope that as Nemo blows over, efforts to bring accountability to drone killings will continue at full force.Read Post | Comments (68)Bill Maher, 02/09/13Host of HBO\u0027s \"Real Time with Bill Maher\"New Rule: Now that he\u0027s suing me for five million dollars because he says he\u0027s proved that he is not the love child of an orangutan, Donald Trump must learn two things: What a joke is, and what a contract is.Read Post | Comments (565)Howard Fineman, 02/07/13Editorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupDeep-dyed conservatives have a right to ask the Roves of the world what the establishment GOPers have done to erase the debt, limit the reach of the federal government or enhance a libertarian view of the world.
