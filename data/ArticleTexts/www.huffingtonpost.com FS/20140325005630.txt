{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Adam WinklerProfessor of Law, UCLAThe most important question raised by the case, however, may be one the lawyers overlook: Can business owners use religion as an excuse to discriminate against LGBT people? If the Supreme Court rules in favor of Hobby Lobby, the answer may well be \"yes.\" We\u0027re already seeing a spate of proposals at the state level for Jim Crow-like laws that would permit discrimination against LGBT people. These laws represent a dangerous and radical break from our national commitment to equality. We don\u0027t allow businesses to discriminate on the basis of race, sex, or a number of other protected categories -- even if the business owners have religious objections.Comments (177)Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027In campaigning for the Affordable Care Act, President Obama famously promised that if you like your current health insurance, you can keep it. Republicans have had a field day with the relatively small number of cases where an insurance policy fails to meet the ACA\u0027s minimum standard and a consumer is asked to buy a better plan -- often at lower cost if the person is of modest income and qualifies for subsidies, but sometimes at higher cost.Comments (358)Bob CescaManaging Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowThis isn\u0027t to suggest that all Republicans are easily-misled simpletons. They\u0027re not. Yet their party consistently panders to its easily-misled simpleton base with the most egregiously dishonest ideas in American politics.Comments (108)Diane RavitchResearch Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027Across the nation, parents and educators are raising objections to the Common Core standards, and many states are reconsidering whether to abandon them and the federally-funded tests that accompany them.Comments (50)Nina IlizaHeart of a Thousand Hills founderFor many people April is the month to commemoration the Rwandan genocide; it is the month to pay homage to those who lost their lives. However, to me, April is just another month I try live without remembering the genocide.CommentsRichard BransonFounder, Virgin GroupAll of these innovations could be replicated by many companies all over the world and there\u0027s good reason to do so -- it\u0027s good for business.CommentsMegan EgbertLibrarian, blogger, momI\u0027d rather have my kids using technology and handheld devices with me beside them. Where I can engage with them, answer questions and limit content if I have concerns.CommentsChris DavisChief Operating Officer, Open Road Integrated Media\"We resent you. You astonish us.\" I understand those two sentences, but will others that come after me? It made me wonder if the newer generation of gay men remembered our recent history and sacrifices that helped them get to where they are today.Comments (12)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Despite the worst roll-out conceivable, the Affordable Care Act seems to be working. But a lot about the Affordable Care Act needs fixing -- especially the widespread misinformation that continues to surround it.Comments (609)Paul Brandeis RaushenbushExecutive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostThe apocalyptic story of Noah that Ari Handel and Darren Aronofsky have rendered will disturb some people -- not because it is unbiblical, but because it is a biblical vision to which they object.Comments (13)Jessica HagyArtist, writer, author of \u0027How to Be Interesting\u0027Gluten is the clear top seed, but Warm Champagne and Spotty Wi-Fi are ready to make deeps runs in the tournament.CommentsGuy KawasakiAuthor, speaker, and advisorOur two main metrics for success are money and power; they drive us to work longer hours, sleep with our phones and tablets and miss important moments with our families. Arianna proposes a third metric for success: thriving.Comments (36)Marty KaplanUSC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorAll that will matter is that the Senate Republican majority will be even more obstructionist than the Senate Republican minority, and they will have the House Republican majority as enablers.Comments (89)Adam GrantWharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027Although many people give at their own expense, there\u0027s a group of people who are productively generous. How do they do give without compromising their well-being and falling short on traditional notions of success? They reject three myths about giving.CommentsCarolyn I. Rodriguez, M.D., Ph.D.Director of the Hoarding Disorders Research Program and Assistant Professor at Columbia University Department of Psychiatry and New York State Psychiatric InstituteBecause ketamine has FDA approval, it can be prescribed legally by any physician. In fact, there are multiple private clinics advertising ketamine infusions, for a fee. But ketamine is still in an early stage of development for depression and OCD. I have my concerns and we need more evidence for its safe use in individuals suffering from these mental illnesses.CommentsAnne-Marie SlaughterPresident and CEO, The New American FoundationThe moments I spend enjoying my birdss -- and yes, talking to them, to my teenage sons\u0027 eternal mortification -- are moments out of time, the moments that Arianna Huffington tells us to create and treasure if we hope to thrive.CommentsChristine PelosiChair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusIf I didn\u0027t have the experience as an attorney and the confidence of an advocate, my path -- our daughter\u0027s path -- might well have been different.CommentsWendell PotterAuthor, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgThe campaign of fear, uncertainty and doubt -- or FUD, to use its acronym -- continues to this day against the Affordable Care Act, and it will be waged in coming months by cynical politicians who believe it will be the surest way to win votes in November.CommentsRalph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorDear President Obama: It is important to remember that whatever moral leverage you may have had in the court of world opinion has been sacrificed by the precedents set by previous American presidents who did not do what you say Mr. Putin should do -- obey international law.CommentsFlorent GeelFIDH Africa Desk DirectorA United Nations peace-keeping mission for Central Africa? This is the ultimate question for the US and the international community as a whole as talks launched in New York on March 6 wend their way to a vote.CommentsSarah KleinSenior Editor, Health \u0026 FitnessAt this age group, the goal is without a doubt more activity. But because it\u0027s also essentially a HIIT workout, which we know burns calories and fat while improving fitness levels, even adults could benefit from a little CrossFit for kids.CommentsRay ChambersUN Special Envoy for Health FinancingToday is World TB Day, and this year\u0027s focus is on finding and treating the 3 million people with active TB who are missed by public health systems.CommentsCaryn Mirriam-GoldbergAuthorGod: You were expecting some white man with a beard. Puleeeaze! Fred: But you\u0027re Black, and you look like Barbra Streisand.CommentsLeo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersThe rich can buy more of everything. More food. More cars. More houses. More vacations. More boats. But for a democracy to function properly, they should be forbidden from buying more votes.Comments (35)Bill PiperDrug Policy Alliance, Director of National AffairsThe position of drug czar was meant to coordinate and improve U.S. drug policy, but traditionally drug czars have been little more than propagandists for the failed drug war -- ignoring science, opposing reform, and stifling debate.CommentsGary HartUnited States Senator (Ret.)Twenty-five years ago or thereabouts I brought together an international consortium to build a new seaport at Novorossiysk, north of Sochi on the Russian Black Sea coast. Needless to say, the proposed world class port never got built.

But mysterious not so much.CommentsMaggie Kozel, M.D.Author, \u0027The Color of Atmosphere: One Doctor\u0027s Journey In and Out of Medicine\u0027The physician that President Obama nominated to be the next Surgeon General sees gun violence as a public health issue, and the NRA has made it clear that any politician they bankroll must vote against his nomination.Comments (18)Arthur FoxPublic interest litigatorWhat most of us fail to recognize is that the gulf between the very rich and the rest of us will almost certainly continue to get worse, a lot worse! Most importantly, it may be too late to do much about it.Comments (60)Liz O\u0027DonnellFounder Hello Ladies,Author Mogul, Mom \u0026 MaidI absolutely believe that we need policies and legislation that support working families, like paid sick days, affordable childcare and eldercare, family leave policies, and fair pay. But I also believe those of us who have the opportunity to make choices can better serve those of us who cannot, when we stop doing what we think we should do, and start doing what works for usCommentsBill MoyersManaging Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyAlready, three times as much money has been raised for this year\u0027s elections as four years ago, when the Citizens United decision was announced.CommentsBudget Travel, 2014.24.03Reb Ezra Weinberg, 2014.24.03Catharine Stimpson, 2014.24.03Patty Kogutek, 2014.24.03Lewis Krell, 2014.24.03Molly Blake, 2014.24.03Marc Landsberg, 2014.24.03Laurie H.
