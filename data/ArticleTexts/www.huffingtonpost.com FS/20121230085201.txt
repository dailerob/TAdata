{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf died, Vladimir Putin signed a bill banning the adoption of Russian children by Americans, and our economy continued to speed towards the fiscal cliff, with Harry Reid accusing John Boehner of waiting until he is reelected as Speaker before seriously negotiating a deal, and the president demanding an up-or-down vote on a stop-gap measure. The poor beached whale that died in Queens, New York midweek seems a fitting metaphor for our political system. On a more positive note, a gun buyback event in Los Angeles was so successful the police ran out of the gift cards that were being exchanged for the turned-in weapons (including 75 assault weapons -- and a pair of rocket launchers). Many of those giving up their guns said they were doing so as the result of the Newtown massacre. Here\u0027s hoping that\u0027s a trend that extends into the new year.Read Post | CommentsMohamed A. El-Erian, 12/28/12CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOIf left to fester, the inability of Congress to step up to economic responsibilities would risk being associated with more than just sluggish growth, persistently high unemployment, and a growing sense of financial discomfort. It would also undermine the country\u0027s longer-term growth potential and, with that, the ability of many citizens to realize the American dream.Read Post | Comments (398)David Bromwich, 12/24/12Professor of Literature at YaleThe forces that ambushed the Hagel nomination are those that, no matter who is president or who is secretary of defense, will continue to press for war with Iran, will work to override constitutional checks against torture and rendition, will seek a pretext to re-ignite the Cold War, and will abort the creation of an independent Palestine.Read Post | Comments (487)Arianna Huffington, 12/24/12If you\u0027re in that 90 percent who\u0027s stressed out this week and next, this might be the list you should be checking twice. Your mind and body -- as well as your family -- will thank you.Read Post | Comments (58)Jeffrey Sachs, 12/29/12Director, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \u0027The Price of Civilization\u0027If the deal is reached, the Republicans have won: they have locked in a federal tax system that collects so little total federal revenue that government can afford almost nothing aside from the military, interest payments, retirement programs and health care.Read Post | Comments (570)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 12/29/12Author, research psychologist and gender scholarPerspectives impact rulings. Understanding other lives is not the forte of homogeneous groups. I am not talking about symbolic diversity. I am not talking about role models and success stories. I am talking about bringing a kind of life perspective to our political representation that will not find its way there on its own.Read Post | Comments (106)Elizabeth Drew, 12/27/12JournalistFar more is at stake in Barack Obama\u0027s decision on whether to nominate Chuck Hagel to be Secretary of Defense than whether Chuck Hagel is nominated.Read Post | Comments (27)Michael Moore, 12/24/12Oscar and Emmy-winning directorWhile we are discussing and demanding what to do, I respectfully ask that we stop and take a look at what I believe are the three extenuating factors that may answer the question of why we Americans have more violence than most anyone else.Read Post | Comments (2,366)Bill Nye, 12/29/12The Science Guy, Partner to SOPHIA.orgRight away, everyone wants to know what\u0027s to be cut. Whatever you all settle on cutting, it should not be science. Investment in science is investment in innovation. New ideas are what keep the U.S. economy driving forward.Read Post | Comments (70)Ralph Nader, 12/28/12Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorMany people view the New Year as a time for resolutions -- losing weight, exercising more, staying in better touch with friends, taking up a new hobby. Here\u0027s something you don\u0027t often hear of when considering New Year\u0027s resolutions -- devoting more time to civic life.Read Post | Comments (17)Jared Bernstein, 12/29/12Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorI can see a weedy, pot-hole-filled path to a deal before New Year\u0027s. Based on sketchy details I\u0027m picking up in the air, McConnell and Reid are apparently huddling over a deal. If they come up with something acceptable to both of them, McConnell will allow it to come to an up-or-down vote.Read Post | Comments (120)Greg Gage, 12/28/12Neuroscientist; Co-founder, Backyard Brains; TED FellowIt is clear that some advances in medical technologies fit the definition of a cyborg. But can the cyborg definition of \"a symbiotic fusion of human and machine,\" be broadly applied to all of us?Read Post | Comments (179)Alan Colmes, 12/28/12Liberal political commentator, host of \"The Alan Colmes Show\" on Fox News Radio, publisher of alan.com, author of \"Thank the Liberals … For Saving America\"Conservatives who claim to care about the safety and well-being of children, even those already-born, would be wise to show they mean it by agreeing to public policy steps that would protect all of us.Read Post | Comments (3,136)Jill Brooke, 12/29/12Playwright, \"What\u0027s Eating You?\"; Author, \"Don\u0027t Let Death Ruin Your Life\"In reflecting on all the people who passed away this year, I am thinking of Nora Ephron and how this witty, wise and loving woman taught us not only how to live but also how to die.Read Post | CommentsGreta Van Susteren, 12/27/12Host of Fox News\u0027 \u0027On the Record with Greta Van Susteren\u0027What is going on now is simply Washington political drama to see who wins. This is not working on a problem and looking for a real solution.Read Post | Comments (101)Marlo Thomas, 12/28/12Award-winning actress, author and activistWe re-elected a president, bought 48 million iPads, dodged a couple hurricanes, obsessed over Tom and Katie\u0027s breakup, and cheered Austrian skydiver Felix Baumgartner, who on October 14 broke the sound barrier in a record-smashing jump from 24 miles up. (He landed fine, btw). What a year it\u0027s been!Read Post | Comments (17)Trita Parsi, 12/27/12President, National Iranian American CouncilWhile America\u0027s relationship with Israel is important, Chuck Hagel is being considered for Secretary of Defense of the United States, not Israel. Whether he would be good for Israel or not cannot be a central concern -- and certainly not the cause to preemptively slander and dismiss this decorated soldier.Read Post | Comments (700)Mike Ryan, 12/28/12Senior Entertainment Writer, The Huffington PostThese are certainly not the best ten sketches of 2012, because they are only my favorite ten sketches. Regardless, I decided to keep the title of \"best sketches\" even though it\u0027s a lie. Here they are.Read Post | Comments (94)Lee Woodruff, 12/23/12Co-author, \u0027In an Instant\u0027, Author, \u0027Perfectly Imperfect\u0027I\u0027m one of those people who never reads a book twice or doesn\u0027t like to see a movie again. But twenty years into my marriage, I broke my rule to re-read Crossing to Safety by Wallace Stegner.Read Post | CommentsBill Moyers, 12/26/12Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyIt\u0027s easy enough to compile a \"best\" and \"worst\" list, but what about bringing attention to important issues that went largely unreported in 2012? Some of the answers will still surprise you.Read Post | Comments (896)Rev. Al Sharpton, 12/26/12President, National Action NetworkWhether it was draconian voter ID laws, the shooting death of young Travyon Martin, or the attacks on women and the workers of America, I went into each challenge concerned that they had outmaneuvered us financially. But in the end, I left convinced that money could not buy genuine commitment.Read Post | Comments (451)Ted Danson and Andrew Sharpless, 12/24/12On Wednesday, Chile became the first country in the world to protect all of its seamounts from bottom trawling, a destructive practice that can reduce centuries-old coral gardens to rubble in moments.Read Post | Comments (116)Margaret Paul, Ph.D., 12/28/12Bestselling author and relationship expertWe all know that being in love is one of the very best feelings in the world.

It took the perfect combination of punches, resilience and an enduring commitment to become a champion. Today, the U.S. is facing a hard-hitting opponent of its own -- diabetes.Read Post | Comments (106)Amy Ephron, 12/28/12AuthorTodays headline: \"Dems to Introduce Gun Control Law on First Day of Congress.\" But look beneath the headline and find that it\u0027s not really a gun control bill at all. It\u0027s not even a halfway measure.Read Post | Comments (348)Robert Reich, 12/28/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The combination of a weakened national party and more intense competition in primaries is making the Republican Party relatively impervious to national opinion. This poses a large strategic problem for the Democrats. It could be an even bigger problem for the nation.Read Post | Comments (1,722)David Katz, M.D., 12/29/12Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterHappy ever after is possible after all -- if we tally the reasons for it in one another\u0027s eyes.

And remember to remember.Read Post | CommentsJon Soltz, 12/28/12Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranWhy are they going so off-the-rails? It boils down to one thing -- Iraq. Neocons will never, ever forgive Senator Hagel for standing up to President Bush, in favor of a pro-troop, pro-security, responsible approach to Iraq.Read Post | Comments (139)Shannyn Moore, 12/27/12Just a girl from Homer, AlaskaIn Alaska, many of us need guns to fill our freezers, but if you need a 30-round clip you\u0027re a pretty poor hunter.

His current position -- let\u0027s just preserve the tax cuts on the bottom 98 percent and fight about the rest of the budget another day -- is exactly what it should have been all along.Read Post | Comments (838)Nisha Chittal, 12/27/12Digital Strategist and WriterMeet 50 women who were the behind-the-scenes rock stars of the 2012 election.
