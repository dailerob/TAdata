{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"From cnn.comLet\u0027s take some of these gems as they come... I\u0027m pretty sure this was the first State of the Union speech with the words \"wood chips\" and \"switch grass,\"...but, of course, even those were surrounded by lies, too. *\"So we strive to be a compassionate, decent, hopeful society.\" It\u0027s the Return of the \"C\" word. Compassion. Too bad Katrina wasn\u0027t spelled C-A-T-R-I-N-A *\"Our economy is healthy, and vigorous, and growing faster than other major industrialized nations.\" Don\u0027t believe the hype. Yes, the GDP grew 3.5 percent in 2005 (though it was only up 1.1 percent in the last quarter). And, yes, productivity is up. But median wages fell, our trade deficit is over $760 billion (80 percent higher than when you took office), inflation is at 3.4 percent, the highest it\u0027s been in half-a-decade, and the gap between the Two Nations is wider than ever. Not exactly figures to crow about.READ POST | comments01.31.2006 Robert SchlesingerHere\u0027s one that confuses me:READ POST01.31.2006 Jesse KornbluthHe\u0027s up past his bedtime, but he\u0027s not ragged.
