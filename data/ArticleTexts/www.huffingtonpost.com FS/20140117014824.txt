{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, Beyond OutrageFor years political scientists have wondered why so many working class and poor citizens of so-called \"red\" states vote against their economic self-interest. The usual explanation is that, for these voters, economic issues are trumped by social and cultural issues like guns, abortion, and race. I\u0027m not so sure. The wages of production workers have been dropping for 30 years, adjusted for inflation, and their economic security has disappeared. Companies can and do shut down, sometimes literally overnight. A smaller share of working-age Americans hold jobs today than at any time in more than three decades. People are so desperate for jobs they don\u0027t want to rock the boat. They don\u0027t want rules and regulations enforced that might cost them their livelihoods. For them, a job is precious -- sometimes even more precious than a safe workplace or safe drinking water.Comments (276)Bob CescaManaging Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowThere will only be more Curtis Reeves cases and more George Zimmerman cases. All because we\u0027ve been conditioned to believe that the law and the Constitution is on the side of the well-armed, heroic shooter, and very seldom on the side of the victim.Comments (146)Dirk HughesCollege registrar in Western MichiganMy story is not unique. It may be surprising, but it is not unique. I have a doctorate. I have been employed full-time for 35 years with only a week or so between jobs. I have worked my butt off my entire adult life. I do not have a drinking or gambling problem. And I still live paycheck to paycheck.Comments (356)Dr. Judson BrewerAssociate Professor, UMass Medical SchoolThe absence of mind wandering likely does not equal the presence of mindfulness, and that effortlessness may be a key aspect of cultivating the fertile soil for creativity to grow.Comments (17)Robert ScobleStartup Liaison for RackspaceGoogle Glass is doomed. Why do I say that? Because the tech press tells me so. Now that we got that out of the way, what have I learned in my eight months of wearing Glass?Comments (39)Wendy WidomPresident, Families in the LoopIf you\u0027re like me, you figured out pretty quickly that marriage is not a magic bullet. It does not take away your problems or improve your self-esteem. So, why do we subtly pressure our friends to join us?Comments (16)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027It\u0027s time to move on from philosophical debates over whether a woman\u0027s place is in the home or the workplace -- women have long been in both. The public conversation we must have now should be about how we can empower women to find their way into economic stability.Comments (54)Kerry KennedyPresident, Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human RightsThe U.S. government must stand on the side of human rights, the rule of law, and democratic progress, not impede or otherwise stunt such progress. If U.S. policy towards Egypt remains unchanged, we will be complicit in continued human rights violations, a totally unacceptable and untenable situation.CommentsDr. Donald R. HopkinsVice President for Health Programs, The Carter CenterThis past year, the national program reported a 99-percent reduction in cases since 2006. In the history of the campaign, this is the greatest reduction of cases in just seven years and is a demonstration of what South Sudan can do with sustained peace when it puts its mind to it.CommentsMartha BurkMoney Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsObama said Congress should pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill that would outlaw the practice of prohibiting employees from discussing their pay with others, and also allow the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to collect some pay data by race and gender. But it\u0027s half a loaf at best.Comments (23)Steve CichonWriter, historian and \"retired\" radio newsman in Buffalo, NYThere are 15 electronic gimzo type items on the page, being sold from America\u0027s Technology Store. 13 of the 15 you now always have in your pocket.Comments (34)H. Alan ScottWriter, Comedian, Fresca enthusiastIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was, uh, well, just another day in the United States of Don\u0027t Get Sick Because You Won\u0027t Be Able to Afford It.Comments (106)Dennis M. KelleherPresident and CEO, Better Markets, Inc.Only in the warped, distorted, Alice-in-Wonderland world of Wall Street would one think \"Washington went to war against big Wall Street banks\" or that \"Washington won [the war] in a blowout,\" as said today in a Politico article.CommentsDouglas Anthony CooperNovelist, AmnesiaTo have it suggested that you are in favor of puppy mills is about as ugly an accusation as you encounter in the world of animal rights or welfare: it is saying that you are in favor of the criminal abuse of animals.CommentsKathleen ReardonProfessor, USC Marshall School; Author, \u0027The Secret Handshake\u0027 and \u0027Shadow Campus\u0027If you haven\u0027t had Stage 4 cancer -- or any of a host of challenging and often frightening illnesses -- then give us all a break and find another topic. Start a different trend. Leave the rest of us to getting on with things the best way we know how. The ConversationComments (35)Nick TurseManaging Editor, TomDispatch.comThe Obama presidency has seen the U.S. military\u0027s elite tactical forces increasingly used in an attempt to achieve strategic goals. But with Special Operations missions kept under tight wraps, Americans have little understanding of where their troops are deployed, what exactly they are doing, or what the consequences might be down the road.CommentsLinda Solomon WoodFounder, Publisher, and Editor-in-Chief, The Vancouver ObserverWith your help, we\u0027ll produce and distribute a provocative film that will go beyond the issues, to the very DNA of change, and encourage constructive discussion across all points of view. It\u0027s the only way we\u0027re going to find the innovative solutions we so badly need. This is an amazing moment. KeystoneXL pipeline, Enbridge\u0027s proposed pipeline, and Kinder Morgan\u0027s pipeline expansion, hang in the balance.CommentsNorman SolomonAuthor, \u0027War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death\u0027The Post is supposed to expose CIA secrets. But Amazon is under contract to keep them. Amazon has a new $600 million \"cloud\" computing deal with the CIA. The situation is unprecedented.CommentsTavis SmileyPBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorHe has amassed a solid acting reputation with diverse roles. He\u0027s also worked in numerous TV series, winning a Golden Globe for his lead turn in Showtime\u0027s House of Lies. Did you know that he\u0027s also a talented musician, who plays sax, writes music and sings?CommentsLincoln Mitchelllincolnmitchell.comChristie\u0027s government acted in a way that suggested that politics are more important than governance. Most politicians do that, but few do it so baldly, and so unequivocally, as Christie did. It is true that Christie himself may not have personally called for partially shutting down several lanes of traffic, but that is no longer relevant.CommentsElizabeth KucinichPolicy Director, Center for Food SafetyAlthough the FDA doesn\u0027t need congressional authorization in order to mandate a federal labeling standard for GMOs, federal lawmakers have become increasingly vocal on the issue.CommentsMohamed NasheedFormer President of the Republic of MaldivesThe conservative movement\u0027s pro-fossil fuel advocacy flies in the face of free-market economics. Why are we continuing to subsidize highly profitable and polluting fossil fuel firms while choking off support for clean energy? We are not supposed to be the fossil fuel industry\u0027s trade union.CommentsRana FloridaCEO, The Creative Class Group \u0026 Author, UpgradeThis video documents the forum my husband Richard Florida participated in with members of the institute and the local community -- he from Toronto, them from a fenced in compound in the rain forest.CommentsNicholas TampioAssistant Professor of Political Science, Fordham UniversityThe Common Core ELA curriculum does not treat teachers or students with dignity. Lest you think that teachers can afford to ignore the modules, consider this fact. The Race to the Top program requires states to use value added modeling in teacher evaluations.Comments (13)Angelina ChapinBlogs Editor, Huffington Post CanadaCreator Lena Dunham doesn\u0027t endorse her characters\u0027 behavior or ask us to feel sympathy for them; she wants their personalities to expose our own weaknesses.CommentsMarjorie CohnProfessor, Thomas Jefferson School of LawWhereas Leon\u0027s detailed analysis demonstrated how Jones leads to the result that the NSA program probably violates the Fourth Amendment, Pauley failed to meaningfully distinguish Jones from the NSA case, merely noting that the Jones court did not overrule Smith.CommentsJon EigLecturer in Screenwriting and Film History, Montgomery CollegeTheir picks. (My deletions.) My picks. Not all that different. Except where they are extremely different.CommentsPeter Van BurenAuthor, \u0027We Meant Well\u0027 and the upcoming \u0027Ghosts of Tom Joad, A Story of the #99Percent\u0027Right-wing claims that Obamacare will let the government into your health records are way out of date. Your health care provider is now part of the metastasizing national security state.CommentsCraig NewmarkFounder, craigslist and craigconnects.orgThe Department of Veterans Affairs is doing some really good stuff for vets that no one hears about, catching up since 2009. I\u0027ve helped, in a very minor way for several years, now I gotta do more, for VA, military families, and vets.CommentsEric WaggonerChair, English department, West Virginia Wesleyan CollegeTo hell with you all for continuing to exploit the lax, poorly-enforced safety regulations here, so that you could do your business in the cheapest manner possible by shortcutting the health and quality of life not only of your workers, but of everybody who lives here.Comments (178)Steve MariottiFounder, Network for Teaching EntrepreneurshipOtessa Marie Ghadar\u0027s global recognition, from the White House to bloggers in Moldova, in addition to her new app, Tapestry, has facilitated her spreading awareness and change.CommentsPaul Florez, 2014.16.01Leonhard Widrich, 2014.16.01Danny Groner, 2014.16.01Brad Friedman and Desi Doyen, 2014.16.01Edward Flattau, 2014.16.01Alice Bean, 2014.16.01Brad Friedman and Desi Doyen, 2014.16.01Richard Bangs, 2014.16.01Greg Carey, 2014.16.01Manilla.com, 2014.16.01Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"REPS REVIVE VOTING RIGHTS FIGHT",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BizYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
