{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027It\u0027s true that history and policy point to overall benefits from expanded trade because all of us gain access to cheaper goods and services. But in recent years the biggest gains from trade have gone to investors and executives while the burdens have fallen disproportionately on those in the middle and below who have lost good-paying jobs. By the same token, most Americans are saying \"no deal\" to further tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations. In fact, some are now voting to raise taxes on the rich in order to pay for such things as better schools, as evidenced by the election of Bill de Blasio as mayor of New York. Conservatives say higher taxes on the rich will slow economic growth. But even if this argument contains a grain of truth, it\u0027s a non-starter as long as 95 percent of the gains from growth continue to go to the top 1 percent -- as they have since the start of the recovery in 2009.Comments (65)Trisha LovetroveFreelance writer and bloggerI admit it. It\u0027s true. I lie to the people running the food pantry. But before you get out your pitchforks and righteous indignation, before you diatribe about me \"abusing the system\" or taking advantage, please let me explain.Comments (140)Jonathan HutsonCommunications strategist based in Washington, D.C.This April Fool\u0027s Day is a good time to check any unfamiliar names on Democratic primary ballots to make sure that Trojan horse candidates don\u0027t sneak votes away from candidates who support real Democratic values.CommentsDiane RavitchResearch Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027This week begins the make-or-break, do-or-die standardized testing that will label your child a success or a failure. I urge you not to let your child take the state test. Opt out.CommentsAl GoreChairman, Generation Investment Management and The Climate Reality ProjectThe new report released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change -- the world\u0027s preeminent group of climate scientists -- represents even more definitive evidence of the growing urgency to immediately reduce the spewing of global warming pollution.Comments (70)Etan ThomasAuthor, poet, philanthropist, 11-year NBA veteranWhen you play Division I sports, you\u0027re not treated as a \"student-athlete\" -- as colleges love to profess to the world -- you\u0027re an athlete-student, and you\u0027re there for one reason and one reason only. You can keep your grades up enough to remain eligible, but then again, that\u0027s only so you can be able to play -- and earn more money for the university.CommentsAni VrabelDeputy blog editor, The Huffington PostThis isn\u0027t about not holding myself accountable for my actions; it\u0027s about no longer reflexively blurting out an apology I don\u0027t really owe. It\u0027s about changing my default setting from unnecessary guilt.Comments (28)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkInstead of attacking a plan that over six million people have signed up for (and counting), why don\u0027t they offer some ideas of their own? Here\u0027s a thought: they don\u0027t have any.Comments (16)Claire FallonBooks Editor, The Huffington PostThe idea that spending several hours with a book needs a new term is an absurd concept. It\u0027s called reading. The activity of sitting down with a novel for the afternoon is not a trend; it\u0027s just how reading has almost always worked.CommentsSen. Bernie SandersIndependent U.S. Senator from VermontThe great political struggle we now face is whether the United States retains its democratic heritage or whether we move toward an oligarchic form of society where the real political power rests with a handful of billionaires, not ordinary Americans.Comments (13)Mike WeisserMike the Gun GuyPro-gun and anti-gun groups can always manufacture a good argument -- but they might try, just once, to ground their opinions in real facts.CommentsSusan P. JoyceEditor and chief technology writer, Job - Hunt.orgDon\u0027t expect a recruiter to look at your resume and immediately understand where you would fit into their organization or to suggest which career path you should choose. They don\u0027t know you well enough, and they aren\u0027t mind readers (fortunately!).CommentsChris WeigantPolitical writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comThere is no shortage of personal stories like this out there. The Democrats should be actively seeking such stories and presenting them to the public. Vetting the stories will be important, to avoid the egg-on-face nature of many of the anti-Obamacare ads, but this shouldn\u0027t be all that hard to accomplish.CommentsAlan SingerSocial studies educator, Hofstra UniversityThe impact of Bloomberg, Gates, Bush, and Obama policies on school segregation can be seen in the New York City neighborhoods of Harlem and Central Brooklyn. Since 2000, demographics in central Harlem have shifted dramatically.CommentsLaura W. MurphyDirector, ACLU Washington Legislative OfficeThe president already has the power to reverse his failed immigration and border security policies. Now he just needs the political will and moral courage.Comments (29)Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of Chicago\"To be clear, I am not saying that citizens should trust the NSA. They should not. Distrust is essential to effective democratic governance. The NSA should be subject to constant and rigorous review, oversight, scrutiny, and checks and balances.\"CommentsRobert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The damage done by the ACA rubs off, not only on President Obama, but on the Democrats\u0027 chances of holding the Senate and on American progressivism as a whole. If Republicans take both Houses of Congress, Obama in his final two years will be the lamest of lame ducks.Comments (227)Alex BergAssociate producer and host, HuffPost LiveEven if these writers concede -- with hesitation of course -- that us bisexuals exist, now we do so without a cultural identity?Comments (142)Michael BrennerSenior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghThere is no credible party within the Executive branch or outside it to oversee implementation of any restrictive rules -- old or new. For at least twelve years, neither the Department of Justice, the federal courts nor the Congress has shown the will, aptitude or conviction to even attempt doing so.CommentsBill MoyersManaging Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyPublic education is becoming big business as bankers, hedge fund managers and private equity investors are entering what they consider to be an \"emerging market.\"CommentsWray HerbertAuthor, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027I have several close friends who are contemplating retirement, and a few have been teetering on that decision for a while. They are not hesitating over financial worries, but more over quality of life issues. They want to be sure that the next stage of life is at least as rich and purposeful as their working years have been.CommentsJames MooreBest selling author, TV political analystThere was a moment in the Ann Richards campaign against George W. Bush when I knew in advance she had lost.Comments (12)Christine PelosiChair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusIt\u0027s MLB opening day: another glorious beginning to the baseball season, another time to reflect on the old clichés and new life lessons we glean from America\u0027s pastime.CommentsRev. Jesse Jackson and Grace Ji-Sun KimIt is important to break this cycle and work towards resolving suspicions between the two Koreas. We can works towards reconciliation and have families reunited. We can build bridges between nations and work for peace.CommentsJames ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027It is important to note that the depiction of the Arab\u0027s last century as being a \u0027cauldron of conflicts\u0027 is most unfair, since fully one half of this period was spent fighting against imperial domination and attempting to remove the last vestiges of colonial rule.Comments (26)Gabi MoskowitzEditor-in-chief of BrokeAss GourmetI wish I could travel back in time and squeeze you and hug you and tell you all about the amazing adventures you\u0027re going to have. I know things are very uncertain right now. You\u0027re about to graduate from college, but beyond that you have no real plan. Real life seems both light years away and scarily fast-approaching.CommentsPeter DreierE.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeWhen Chavez left his job as a community organizer in San Jose in 1962 and moved to rural Delano to try, once again, to bring a union to California\u0027s lettuce and grape fields, even his closest friends figured he was delusional.CommentsState Rep. Jessica FarrarState Representative, Harris County, TexasWe would love to stop talking about the war on women. But for that to happen, Republican will need to stop inserting themselves into the doctor-patient relationship and quit using anti-woman legislation to boost their chances in a primary election.Comments (18)Melinda Gates and Kathy CalvinOur desire to bring every good thing to our children is a force for good in the world.CommentsPhilip K. HowardAuthor, \u0027The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America\u0027Fairness almost always requires context. That\u0027s why zero tolerance rules are counterproductive, fostering a culture of legal argument instead of being tethered to community norms of right and wrong.CommentsLeo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersThese young people place their health in jeopardy every time they step on the field. They know that. They love the game, and they\u0027re willing to take necessary risks. But they shouldn\u0027t be exposed to unnecessary risks. No amount of scholarship money justifies endangering young people needlessly.Comments (12)Chris Weigant, 2014.31.03Rev. G.
