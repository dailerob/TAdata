{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Global Editorial DirectorThe next pivotal point in American politics is custom-built for protest candidates. That, as much as anything, explains why Sen. Bernie Sanders and scaremongering billionaire Donald Trump are leading in New Hampshire primary polls by wide margins. At the same time, the biggest risk for Sanders and Trump is that the conventional wisdom says they will win. New Hampshire hates to ratify the conventional wisdom. Nowhere else in America is as suspicious of any and all establishments, as dedicated to its own vast array of local officeholders, and as resistant to being told what to do or think by Washington, Wall Street or national media bloviators.Bernie Sanders\u0027 campaign has already accomplished what most observers thought was impossible. This campaign is a rare, perhaps unprecedented event in this country\u0027s modern electoral history. It deserves the support of everyone who favors social and economic justice.Actor, producer and humanitarianAs Black girls in a high school in Newark, NJ made clear to me, the anxieties around power, citizenship, and protection they arouse within and outside of an imagined monolithic Black community reveals more about our oppressively flawed and dehumanizing social order than it does about the category \"black girl.\"Cultural anthropologist, movement artist, and associate chair of African and African American Studies at Fordham University.Hillary Clinton is not the first progressive Democratic woman to be challenged by Bernie Sanders. It\u0027s difficult to find that sweet spot where a woman is \"just right\" tough enough to be commander in chief and feminine enough to be mother of the nation.First Female Governor of Vermont; Marsh Scholar, University of VermontWhen it comes to mental illness, the problem isn\u0027t how we describe those who suffer but how we as individuals ultimately choose to view them, which is just that: a choice. Instead of renaming the conversation, how about reframing the entire body of thought around the topic?Author, research psychologist and gender scholarHillary Clinton finds it \"amazing\" that Iowa young female voters preferred Bernie Sanders. It\u0027s a bitter pill to for Secretary Clinton. But beyond the matter of personal choice, there are some reasons that are both natural and inevitable in our society.Professor Emerita, USC Marshall School; Author, \u0027The Secret Handshake\u0027 and \u0027Shadow Campus\u0027Veterans realize the VA has its issues - but they also realize that these issues are fixable, and understand that privatizing the VA only makes things worse.Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranFor the first half hour of the opening two-way debate between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, both candidates appeared tired. But then Clinton sprang into action, forcefully striking back at Sanders for criticizing her acceptance of corporate campaign donations.Professor of Journalism, Northeastern University, BostonThe growing public health crisis posed by the spread of the Zika virus demands the urgent attention of leaders at all levels of government, including those who seek our nation\u0027s highest office.President, NARAL Pro-Choice AmericaThere\u0027s no doubt that Hillary is the candidate of Wall Street. Even more dangerous, though, is that she is the candidate of the military-industrial complex. The idea that she is bad on the corporate issues but good on national security has it wrong.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia UniversityAs president, Bernie Sanders might tweak the Pentagon budget by eliminating a few billion dollars of waste. He might scale back on U.S. interventions. But he would more likely continue in the direction in which he has started moving as candidate: demonstrating that he can wield power just like the big boys.Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogThe initiative seeks to reintroduce parole hearings and early releases. If it passes, nonviolent felons will come up for parole once they complete the basic term for their original offense.Independent source of news and analysis, from the academic and research community.Refusing to show interest in a different perspective should not serve as a badge of pride in your own ideas. It actually serves the exact opposite function. It proves that you don\u0027t even understand your own opinion.Director and screenwriter living in LAWe found ourselves this week talking about two very different guys, both born in Canada, who skated to triumph thanks to their fans. Ted Cruz is no team player. He\u0027s out for no one but himself. And he has a history of switching teams until they fulfill his ambitions.Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyProducer, Moyers \u0026 CompanyThe link between female genital cutting and cases of keloid, dysmenorrhea and urinary incontinence became clear. Five years ago, I decided not to practice excision any more. Soon after, my village decided to ban FGM.Former FGM excisor turned activistOnly when we openly and truthfully speak to the roots of racism and inequality in our country -- white supremacy, white privilege, and the dehumanization and devaluation of black lives and bodies -- will we able to deal with the modern-day realities of that legacy.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersThe banksters made millions of deliberately fraudulent, not \"reckless\" loans and they most assuredly \"created the foreclosure crisis.\" Hillary went on to throw the victims of these frauds under the bus.Prof; Econ \u0026 Law, UMKC. Financial regulator. White-collar criminologist. Founding member, Bank Whistleblowers United. Author: The Best Way to Rob a Bank is to Own One.I am running to be the 50th Mayor of Baltimore in order to usher our city into an era where the government is accountable to its people and is aggressively innovative in how it identifies and solves its problems. We can build a Baltimore where more and more people want to live and work, and where everyone can thrive.Writer, Educator,Sure, hypocrisy is the coin of the realm in politics, and both sides play that game. But Republicans have taken the false indignation of double standards to a level rarely before seen in our political discourse.Scientist and former White House Senior Policy Analyst; Ph.D. in marine biology/neurophysiologyMore Americans than ever before say they would not let their sons play football. Yet football remains our favorite spectator sport (it\u0027s not even close) and there is nothing to indicate that\u0027s about to change.Author, \u0027The Evangelicals You Don\u0027t Know\u0027Tributes to Marlow Cook in his hometown and state never came his way during his lifetime. It\u0027s long overdue for something of note to be named for this remarkable man, who bucked politics and party to do what he thought was right.JournalistAs a recently suffering Oakland Raiders fan, I greeted the death of Kenny \"The Snake\" Stabler with a cocktail of fond memories. But it\u0027s a cocktail laced with the bitter news that Stabler, like so many of his peers, had suffered for years from the effects of concussions.Editor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027They Know Everything About You\u0027When society uses groups or stereotypes to sort, it discards the very thing that creates value. It\u0027s a lazy man\u0027s approach to thinking. Or, maybe it\u0027s not thinking at all. This laziness denies the very best thing each of us have to offer: ourselves.Corporate Director and AuthorA new film highlights the work of Land Artists, rebels who, in looking for a larger canvas, rejected the frame, the plinth, even the wall, and sought to create experiences for themselves and for the viewer that would give the word \"art\" an entirely new dimension. The director, James Crump, says, \"It is important to me that a new generation of much younger artists rediscover these troublemakers in order to fully realize that making art is not simply for the market.\"Culture Columnist, Huffington Post, CultureZohnIt\u0027s time to face the fact that the U.S. mission in Afghanistan has changed significantly since 2001 when Congress passed the authorization for the use of military force there. We simply cannot continue on the current path.U.S. Representative from Massachusetts\u0027 2nd DistrictThis is the life of a teacher. Once in a while, you get stories like the one Marcus is telling me. He is all grown up, with children of his own. But he still remembers what you said. You write a long apology back, and you hope maybe he will forgive you.Memoirist, humorist, bloggerSalafists is causing a sensation in Paris. The movie highlights -- and this, too, has seldom been done -- the religious inspiration that motivates these criminals.French philosopher and writerWives are not better than husbands. Women are not better than men. (Nor the other way around.) But I see a hell of a lot of men getting marriage wrong, and this is my way of trying to help.Writer, single dad, amateur therapist, bad Twitter user. Likes: Funny stuff, books and not divorcing. Blogger at MustBeThisTallToRide.com.Quite honestly, I\u0027m tired of unrequited morality. In a perfect world, right is right and wrong is wrong. This is not a perfect world though. And while I\u0027m not rushing to the defense of Beyonce, I won\u0027t exert my energy to join in on dragging her either.Writer, know-it-all, goofball, revolutionary!I wanted to stretch my arms into the clouds and pull the moon closer; perhaps its light would expose the perpetrators, stopping them from committing the crime they were plotting.Blog Editor, The Huffington Post ArabiI never thought I would become a vegetarian. To be honest, I used to think vegetarians were snooty people with \"holier than thou\" attitudes. I never asked the questions I was afraid to know the answers to. Now, I know the truth.Writer, feminist, bibliophile, and political junkie.Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day. Newsletters may offer personalized content or advertisements.
