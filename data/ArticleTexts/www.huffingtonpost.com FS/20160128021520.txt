{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Last week more than 2,500 global leaders from more than 100 countries came together in Davos for the annual World Economic Forum. The dominant topic of discussion this year -- both inside the talks and panels and outside, as well -- was transition. Klaus Schwab, the Forum\u0027s founder, captured the spirit with this year\u0027s theme, the Fourth Industrial Revolution, calling for a collective future \"that reflects ultimately that the human being should be at the center.\" This human element was unmistakably at the center of the conversation. It was the year of explicit calls from leaders in business, technology, media and governments across the globe for a way of working that goes beyond an obsession with shareholders, profits and quarterly earnings, and for a way of living that prioritizes our well-being -- including, and especially, sleep.If you want to help Flint, sign the petition, demand that the federal government take action, and then get involved yourself, wherever you live, so that this doesn\u0027t happen to you -- and so that the people we elect know they can no longer break the law as they rule by indifference. We deserve much better than this.Oscar and Emmy-winning DirectorSomething we can do right now to combat pay inequality in the workplace is talk with our co-workers about our salaries. While Congress works to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act to address the multiple barriers to pay equality, knowing our rights could help us now.Representing CA\u0027s 41st District -- Member of the House Veterans\u0027 Affairs Committee \u0026 House Education and Workforce CommitteeDonald Trump\u0027s language, although less consistently anti-government than Ted Cruz\u0027s, is something new and strange. That is part of his unsettling novelty.Professor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027The fourth industrial revolution is using digital technology to revolutionize almost every part of our life at an unprecedented pace. But one of the biggest implications is just how harmful this revolution may be to the progress of women because they are underrepresented in tech.CEO of YouTubeAn African virus is spreading in the Americas, apparently causing the babies of infected mothers to be born with deformed heads. The World Health Organization said it will soon spread to almost all countries in the Americas, including to the U.S. A perfect storm of biological events has unfolded -- any one of which by itself would have been relatively harmless.Senior Fellow for Global Health, Council on Foreign RelationsEgypt\u0027s \"deep state\" did not disappear with Mubarak and his regime. Yes, removing an authoritative dictator who ruled for nearly 30 years was indeed a challenge and a major feat. However, as the past five years have shown us, we clearly were not prepared for what came next.American-Egyptian blogger, Analyst, Muslim millennialWhile much progress has been made to advance women\u0027s health over the past 20 years, clearly more remains to be done. While women now represent the majority of participants in clinical trials supported by the NIH, this alone will not be not sufficient to advance women\u0027s health.Public Health Editor, The Huffington Post; Former U.S. Assistant Surgeon GeneralConsider two people circumnavigating the globe at the equator from the same starting point but moving in opposite directions; the two points furthest apart converge at the end where the journey began; so too here with anti-science zealotry on left and right: They merge together in a bond of extremism. Nowhere can this circle of delusion be seen better than with the emergence of the Zika virus, a mosquito-borne disease that can cause devastating brain damage in newborns.Scientist and former White House Senior Policy Analyst; Ph.D. in marine biology/neurophysiologyThe New York Times should have fact-checked Jake Sullivan\u0027s claim on Iran diplomacy when they reported it. It would be easy enough for them to compare Sullivan\u0027s accusation with the actual debate transcript.Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicyIf the American public wants to spend scarce taxpayer dollars to entrap and arrest people for promoting adult prostitution, that\u0027s one thing. But it\u0027s disingenuous for law enforcement to wrap what they\u0027re doing in the guise of sex slavery when that may not be what\u0027s going on here at all.Award-winning journalist, author and journalism professorAccording to the latest polls, Bernie is the strongest Democratic candidate in the general election, defeating both Donald Trump and Ted Cruz in hypothetical match-ups.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027Fear of truth is a powerful motivator for Japan, it would seem. But the truth cannot be suppressed forever. The authorities can use their power to prevent O\u0027Barry and other dolphin protectors from entering Japan, but they cannot take away our freedom of expression.Dolphin freedom advocate, writerFaced with this universally-recognized Nazi symbol prominently displayed on D.D.\u0027s body, the symbol of the systematic slaughter of 6 million European Jews, could I care for this patient?Robert W. Berliner Emeritus Professor of Medicine, Senior Research Scientist, Yale School of Medicine; physician, author, poet, artist.One essential factor in building a more inclusive prosperity is giving all Americans easy ways to save for their retirement years. That\u0027s why I have been thrilled to work on the unveiling of myRA--\"my Retirement Account\"--a game changer that will help Americans begin to save for a safe and comfortable retirement.Deputy Secretary of the United States Treasury DepartmentMary Beard\u0027s history of ancient Rome, SPQR: A History of Ancient Rome, offers disturbing lessons for 21st century America. Efforts to draw direct parallels can be too forced. But as countless commentators since Santayana have pointed out, failure to learn from history quite often guarantees repeat of its mistakes.United States Senator (Ret.)To many, the argument seems compelling; he is, after all, a professed socialist who for most of his career refused to run as a Democrat. But plausible as the electability argument seems, the question remains: is it true?Professor of sociology, University of California at BerkeleyI, for one, confess that I\u0027m really confused. How did Fox News go from something we maligned, laughed at, feared, thought of as SO right wing to a hard-edged news force that even, dare I say his name for fear of retribution, Donald Trump was afraid of?AuthorIt\u0027s not a new phenomenon for a politician to use someone\u0027s suffering for political gain, but Sarah Palin, in addressing her son\u0027s arrest last week for domestic violence, has managed both to propagate a series of misunderstandings about PTSD and to dishonor veterans.Director, The Soul Repair CenterFor a long time, as he campaigned for president, a wide spectrum of establishment media insisted that Bernie Sanders couldn\u0027t win. Now they\u0027re sounding the alarm that he might. And, just in case you haven\u0027t gotten the media message yet -- Sanders is \"angry,\" kind of like Donald Trump.Author, \u0027War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death\u0027We welcome the Obama-Biden commitment to strengthening the federal investment in cancer research, prevention, and treatment. Collaboration between institutes and scientists is key.Institute Professor at the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MITFounder and CEO of The Sherry Lansing FoundationI became tired of wishing my work was easier. Tired of pretending to be someone I wasn\u0027t. Tired of going home grumpy and heading straight to bed because I was so exhausted. To love my work as an introvert, I knew I had to make some changes. Changes that would allow me to thrive as an introvert in an extroverted work environment.Blogger, Author, coach-on a mission to help you identify your talent and boost your income.Federal law enforcement policies implemented within the past 15 years demonstrates that such faith-based tracking, ethnic profiling, and declarations of war against Islam did little to prevent attacks.Professor of Sociology and American Studies, University of Southern CaliforniaAnyone who waves of women\u0027s concerns about \"something as trivial as street harassment,\" as I\u0027m so often told, is actively, and now consciously, part of the problem.Feminist, writer, and satirist (not always in that order)I am very concerned when I see presidential candidates fanning the flames of animosity. It is an all too familiar recipe: Strip away individuality and wrap everyone in the group into an amorphous and frightening entity.Holocaust survivor, speaker, writerRepublican candidates tend to ignore or actively incite fear of the growing Latino community. But Democrats also do a poor job of turning out Latinos in high numbers and, when in office, are unable to deliver on priority issues for the Latino community. Low voter turnout is a symptom of civic disengagement by Latinos in American society.Chair, Latinos and Society Program at the Aspen Institute and Chair of the Board of US Hispanic Media, Inc.Maybe my marriage didn\u0027t end on my terms, but it was an opportunity to better myself. And I\u0027ve found peace, love and success as I\u0027ve changed the things that may have helped create cracks in the foundation the first time around.Blogger, 3boys1blogandme.wordpress.comIt is hard to explain to others what it is like to have hearing loss. I am neither a child nor an invalid. If someone asks me a question and I don\u0027t hear it, please repeat it so I can answer for myself. I want to hear you and am trying my best.Hearing health advocate, board member, avid Bikram yogiAmericans who understand the challenge of climate change had to be encouraged by the Paris summit where the nations of the globe, including the U.S., pledged to work together to dramatically reduce the burning of fossil fuels -- before it is too late to avoid disaster.Co-Director, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureWhat I hope to accomplish is simple: I want to become more comfortable with the idea of death. I want to get to a point where I\u0027m (reasonably) okay with dying. Obviously, I don\u0027t want to rush things, but as I get closer and closer to that day, I don\u0027t want to be terrified. I want to be able to accept it.Recovery advocate, writer, and proud father of a person in long-term recovery.Most analysts are hesitant to associate terrorism with Christianity, a world religion with the most followers in the world, and prefer to view such violence as a mere marginal features of the Christian world.Associate Professor of Communication, Culture and Religion at University of California, San DiegoGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
