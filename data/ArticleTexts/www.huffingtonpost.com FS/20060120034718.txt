{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AP/Colin WinterbottomAP/Manuel Balce CenetaThe Right is spinning Hillary\u0027s plantation comment as the most outrageous racial affront since George Wallace stood in that schoolhouse door. Clearly it\u0027s not. But just because the GOP is whipping up the POM (Phony Outrage Machine), it doesn\u0027t mean her Democrats-as-slaves metaphor deserves defending. What it tells us is not about race but about Hillary\u0027s tin ear and her lack of awareness of it. Her \"just between you and me tone\" was like watching someone who thinks they can sing belting out an off-key song while everyone looks on with clenched smiles. READ MOREA Sneak Peek at \"Al vs. Hillary\" Have you seen the coming attraction trailer for \"Democratic Presidential Nomination \u002708: Al vs. Hillary\" yet?

But is the word \"plantation\" politically out of bounds? If so, dozens of Republicans would be hauled into the dock.READ POST | comments (13)01.17.2006 Paul RieckhoffAs the war in Iraq approaches its third anniversary, it\u0027s easy to lose perspective. \"Why We Fight,\" a stunning new documentary, is a great way to quickly reacquaint yourself with the history of the American military.READ POST | comments01.17.2006 Steven G.

The margin would in all likelihood have been less convincing if President Bush had not originally nominated Harriet Miers to fill retiring Justice O\u0027Connor\u0027s vacancy, delaying Samuel Alito\u0027s confirmation.READ POST | comments01.17.2006 Christopher HitchensIt is of the first importance that we demarcate, clearly and immediately, the areas in which our government may or may not treat us as potential enemies.READ POST | comments (150)01.17.2006 Jane SmileyA few days ago, I invited readers to vote for \"the central madman\" in the Bush administration.
