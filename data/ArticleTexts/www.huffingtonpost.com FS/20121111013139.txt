{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, The Huffington PostPowerful men use sex in ways that powerful women don\u0027t. What is unclear is why. Is sex so fundamentally different for each gender that men see it as exerting their influence, while women somehow succumb to it? Have we simply not reached the point where there are enough women in positions of power, a critical mass that will make cheating an equal opportunity perk of office -- men do this because they can, and women don\u0027t because they can\u0027t... yet? Or are women just more moral than men? The answer is probably all of the above, none of the above, and it is much more complicated than that. If -- when -- the scales balance (the last election was a good start) we will likely learn that it isn\u0027t just sex that means different things to men and women, but also power. Until then, the parade of cheating men will inevitably march on.Read Post | Comments (576)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 11/10/12Author, research psychologist and gender scholarResearch shows women may be cheating now almost as much as men.

Gerbarg, M.D., 11/10/12Assistant Clinical Professor in PsychiatryWhen we listen to political speakers and to the pundits parsing their words, and as we try to decide who to trust, it may be worth focusing a few moments on body language.

Knorr, MS CCC, 11/10/12We know that traumatic brain injury increases rates of suicide and that it is the \"signature injury\" of the current wars. Yet it frequently goes undetected, or is misdiagnosed as PTSD or depression. Patients who are misdiagnosed, and therefore mistreated, are unlikely to recover. Instead, they are likely to despair.Read Post | Comments (25)Gary Hart, 11/10/12President, Hart International, Ltd.No one argues that resumption of pre-Bush tax rates on the wealthiest 1 percent will solve the deficit problem. What we do argue is equity -- fairness. The entire idea of progressive taxes is that those who benefit the most from our nation\u0027s services should pay a fair share.Read Post | Comments (135)Mike Lux, 11/10/12Partner, Democracy PartnersIf the middle class engine isn\u0027t purring, the economic road to recovery will be bumpy at best.

It\u0027s the media that, whatever it\u0027s orientation -- right, left, or down the middle -- can agree on one thing: We\u0027re increasingly a country of people who want to choose up sides, go to our respective corners, and throw things at one another.Read Post | Comments (46)Geoffrey R.
