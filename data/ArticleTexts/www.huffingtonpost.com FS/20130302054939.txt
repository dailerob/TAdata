{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Author, \"How to Make a Million Dollars an Hour\" (Wiley 2013)We need to reframe the debate yet again. Wall Street should pay for the damage it created. They owe us. That money should be used to put Americans back to work by rebuilding our infrastructure, insulating our homes and businesses, and by paying tuition for Americans who want and need higher education. To make such a message work, we will need a sustained movement that operates outside the confines of the two parties -- parties that incessantly seek Wall Street\u0027s largess, (Yes, there are a handful of exceptional Democratic and Independent fighters.)

Get ready.Read Post | Comments (260)Jamie Lee Curtis, 03/01/13Actress and children\u0027s book authorI was offended last week. As an Academy member, as the child of former Academy members and as a woman, I expected more from the best that the movie business has to offer. The Oscars are about honoring art and artists. It is not supposed to be a cheesy vaudeville show.Read Post | Comments (216)Bob Cesca, 03/01/13Political Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowThere are two sides to the deficit idiocy. Firstly, the completely inexcusable conflation of the deficit and the debt, and, secondly, the total failure to acknowledge actual deficit reduction. As a result, deficit hysteria is based on nearly unprecedented stupidity and deliberate deception.Read Post | Comments (514)Marlo Thomas, 03/01/13Award-winning actress, author and activistLast Monday was terrible. The phone began ringing before 9 a.m., I had back-to-back (to-back) meetings well into the afternoon, and by the time happy hour arrived, I was not happy at all. My back hurt and my head was spinning. I was, what my mom used to call, \"cranky.\" Then a friend sent me an email.Read Post | Comments (32)Robert Reich, 03/01/13Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The President should let the public see the Tea Partiers for who they are -- a small, radical minority intent on dismantling the government of the United States.

It\u0027s more complex than that.

And that was the problem. I didn\u0027t want to be healthy; I wanted to be skinny. And I wanted to be skinny more than I wanted to be anything else. When I was 11, a friend asked me what superpower I wanted. I told her I wanted to be invisible.Read Post | Comments (29)Jon Soltz, 03/01/13Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranOn the dawn of sequestration, Republicans are still in deep disagreement over how it will affect our military, and in even deeper disagreement over how to handle it. One thing they do seem to agree on, though, is that they aren\u0027t willing to close corporate tax loopholes to avoid it.Read Post | Comments (120)Marian Wright Edelman, 03/01/13President, Children\u0027s Defense FundToday, too many would-be movement leaders simply want to be Dr. King or Mrs. Rosa Parks: they want the glory and privilege of leadership without the burdens or sacrifice and sustained hard work. Movements are not built from the top down by powerful leaders but percolate from the bottom up from people who share common grievances.Read Post | CommentsJessie Woolley-Wilson, 03/01/13Chair, President and CEO, DreamBox LearningHow do you measure individual learning progression when students are exclusively engaged in collective learning?
