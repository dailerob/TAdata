It is designed to take away many of the worker rights that unions have conferred throughout their history: the right to a living wage. The right to equal pay for women. The right to deferred payments in the form of pensions. The right to negotiate workplace standards and working conditions. The right to overtime pay. The law is intended to destroy unions, or at least make then ineffective. It says simply that workers do not have to pay union dues to take a job -- even if they get benefits previously negotiated by a union. The deeper truth about unions is they work for all of us. Including businesses: Workers are profit creators.Read Post | Comments (930)Marlo Thomas, 12/13/12Award-winning actress, author and activistWe love a good story about an amazing invention that turns someone\u0027s life around and makes them into a millionaire. It\u0027s especially fun when the inventor is someone unexpected, like a stay-at-home mom or a grandmother with a dream.Read Post | CommentsKlaus Schwab, 12/14/12Founder and Executive Chairman, World Economic ForumThe eurozone will not break up. The price of departure is simply too great for any one country. Indeed, when Mario Draghi announced on 6 September that the European Central Bank would undertake unlimited purchases of government bonds, the continent crossed the bridge to its future.Read Post | Comments (12)William K. Black, 12/13/12Assoc. Professor, Univ. of Missouri, Kansas City; Sr. regulator during S\u0026L debacleThere is no indication that the regulators, prosecutors or government leaders considered doing the right thing at HSBC. That is how destructive making implicit assumptions and adopting the pro-crony framing of issues is in the real world.Read Post | Comments (289)Arianna Huffington, 12/12/12To hear the media tell it, all eyes are on the fiscal cliff. What will the deal ultimately be? And, most important, which side will win and which side will lose? Actually, only Washington and the media are transfixed. The rest of the nation is absorbed with trying to make it in the struggling economy.Read Post | Comments (242)Amy Morrison, 12/12/12Blogger, Pregnant ChickenWe live in a time when we can Google everything, share ideas and expose our children to amazing opportunities, but anyone that implies that they have it figured out is either drunk or lying (or both), so don\u0027t be too hard on yourself.Read Post | Comments (169)Michael Calderone, 12/13/12Senior Media Reporter, The Huffington PostThese days, the \"debate\" in the media seems less about whether waterboarding is a form of torture and more about the portrayal of torture in the soon-to-be-released film Zero Dark Thirty.Read Post | Comments (25)Scott Mendelson, 12/13/12Film critic at Mendelson\u0027s Memos, Valley Scene MagazineThe harshest thing I can say about Tom Hooper\u0027s Les Misérables is that I can only imagine those who have not seen the original show wondering what the fuss has been all about.Read Post | Comments (23)Donna Highfill, 12/13/12Writer, Coach, Humorist, and Change ConsultantI still have a magnet on my refrigerator that my daughter gave me which says, \"My husband has my heart, but my neck belongs to Edward.\" I wouldn\u0027t want to become a vampire -- who wants to spend eternity as a menopausal bloodsucker? It\u0027s too violent to even consider.Read Post | CommentsVicki Larson, 12/12/12Journalist, mother, thinkerFor all our studies about how divorce impacts kids, ranging from the doom and gloom genre to \"the kids are all right\" variety, we don\u0027t seem to ask the most important people of all what they think -- the kids themselves.Read Post | Comments (89)Amelia, 12/13/12Mother, wife, partner and breadwinnerAs a parent, one of the great joys is exposing my kids to all the stuff I liked when I was little. We have a built-in excuse to buy things like The Goonies or The NeverEnding Story. But a few times that we\u0027ve gone back to our childhood favorites, we\u0027ve had a harsh wake-up call.Read Post | Comments (364)Gordon Brown, 12/13/12Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationIf every girl is to go to school then we will have to end the practice of child brides. Universal education is not possible until children are able to grow up as girls -- not brides.Read Post | Comments (23)Karima El Hakkaoui and Linda Hampshire, 12/13/12Holy Hell, can this one bring the outraged parents out of their closets. So irate can guests become, you\u0027d think you\u0027d announced you were clubbing kittens to death for the evening entertainment. And the issue at hand...? Kids or no kids at your wedding.Read Post | Comments (184)Jared Bernstein, 12/13/12Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorI\u0027m glad Ben Bernanke is standing tall, doing his best to keep the focus on growth and jobs. But the fact that he\u0027s virtually alone in that pursuit is what\u0027s so disturbing.Read Post | Comments (21)Steven Strogatz, 12/13/12Jacob Gould Schurman professor of applied mathematics, Cornell UniversityHere\u0027s a gift to everybody out there, students and teachers and especially parents, who might still be befuddled about some of the more puzzling things that came up in math class. This is why the teacher said what she said.Read Post | CommentsAmb. Marc Ginsberg, 12/13/12Fmr. U.S. Ambassador to Morocco \u0026 White House Middle East AdviserThe Syrian refugee crisis is, by any objective measure, an international humanitarian catastrophe, and the all-too-belated and by any standard paltry international response is one reason why so many Syrians are so furious with the west\u0027s measured indifference.Read Post | Comments (16)Mike Ryan, 12/13/12Senior Entertainment Writer, The Huffington PostRead Post | Comments (12)Robert Reich, 12/12/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027By linking interest rates directly to the rate of unemployment, Bernanke is acknowledging that the Federal Reserve Board has two mandates: not just price but also employment. But the sad fact is near-zero interest rates won\u0027t do much for jobs because banks aren\u0027t allowing many people to take advantage of them.Read Post | Comments (353)Barbara Bruno, 12/12/12NFL Analyst and Commentator, Independent Film Producer, Non-Profit Grant WriterWhen making those water cooler Week 15 NFL Picks, consider the football youth explosion at quarterback.Read Post | CommentsRabbi Shmuley Boteach, 12/13/12Rabbi and WriterOpponents of abortion do not look to the Constitution to cement their opposition but the Bible, and, as such, it is worth reviewing the Biblical text pertaining to abortion, which yields surprising results.Read Post | Comments (333)Cecile Richards, 12/12/12President of Planned Parenthood Federation of America and Planned Parenthood Action FundAn alarming set of bills is about to move to Michigan Governor Rick Snyder\u0027s desk as soon as today. Pushed through by lame-duck legislators who are about to leave office, these bills would make Michigan one of the most regressive states in the nation on women\u0027s health.Read Post | Comments (858)Noah Michelson, 12/13/12Editor, HuffPost Gay VoicesYesterday HuffPost Gay Voices published a piece entitled \"The 27 Gayest Christmas Songs,\" but it had only been up for a few minutes when we started receiving complaints. I believe these people misunderstand -- or forget -- what it means to be queer and why it\u0027s such a brilliant thing.Read Post | Comments (97)Robert Kuttner, 12/13/12Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027President Obama has displayed new toughness in the budget battle, but his pace of appointing federal judges, much less fighting for Senate confirmation of liberal ones, has been dismal. Why hasn\u0027t his new resolve translated into a struggle to rebalance the federal courts, which are still dominated by movement conservatives appointed by Bush and Reagan?Read Post | CommentsJeremiah Goulka, 12/13/12WriterThe GOP wants to tweak its talking points slightly and put more minority and female Republicans on stage as spokespeople. Many in the GOP seem to believe that this will do the trick in 2014 and beyond. Are they deluded?Read Post | Comments (16)Sen.

El-Erian, 12/12/12CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOAnalysts will be hard pressed to explain how equity markets ended unchanged on the day of an unprecedented policy announcement from the Fed. An answer can be found by considering the competing emotions a patient feels when confronted with a new drug that has yet to go through clinical testing.Read Post | Comments (40)William T. Talman, MD, 12/07/12Professor of Neurology and Neuroscience, University of IowaI suspect that most people don\u0027t realize how much they owe their well-being, even their lives, to research using experimental animals. Do animals used in research deserve protection? Yes, and they get it.Read Post | Comments (679)Bill Gates and Melinda Gates, 12/12/12This holiday season, we decided to list several of the charity initiatives that have sparked our interest. Each of these projects takes a different approach, but they have three things in common: they\u0027re innovative, committed to transparency and accountability, and they\u0027re getting good results.Read Post | Comments (53)Marcus Samuelsson, 12/13/12Award-Winning Chef, Restaurateur \u0026 AuthorWhy don\u0027t we use chickpeas more?
