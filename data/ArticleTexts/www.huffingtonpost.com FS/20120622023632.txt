{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Political Science Professor, University of DelawareIf things are so horrible and bad with the economy why haven\u0027t Mitt Romney\u0027s numbers jumped through the sky and Barack Obama\u0027s numbers plummeted in the latest polls? I don\u0027t think that any smart reader of polls can tell you today who will win in November, but campaign research suggests that Romney will have a much tougher time than Obama moving forward because of VP pick scrutiny, national debate preparation, the changing of national and international issues will require him to be more specific in his positions, and the like. Obama has the advantage of incumbency and stronger favorability than Romney; Romney\u0027s main political advantage is that he\u0027s not currently in any elected office to see how he\u0027d perform in this economy.

But every day we utter words that we know aren\u0027t true. Sometimes we do it to make someone else feel better. Other times, it\u0027s ourselves we are hoping to protect.

ChicagoIt seems that some minimum wage employers are trying to pay their workers less -- and to even make it legal to do so. It seems unfathomable that anyone would consider the minimum wage -- which, for a full-time worker, provides a yearly salary that is thousands of dollars below the poverty line for a family of three or four -- to be too high.Read Post | Comments (18)HRH The Prince of Wales, 06/21/12HRH The Prince of WalesNow, as never before, is the time to re-integrate nature\u0027s economy with our own so that, instead of living dangerously off nature\u0027s rapidly diminishing capital, we draw a sustainable income from the wise management of that precious capital.
