{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Founder, Virgin GroupThe war on drugs has had a devastating impact in the U.S. Yet, as Republicans and Democrats gather at their national conventions, neither party has taken a strong stand on the critical need to support drug policy reform. And that\u0027s surprising. Drug reform is not a partisan issue.

Sabet, Ph.D., 09/04/12Asst. Professor, University of FloridaThis year, exactly three decades after both Democrats and Republicans first focused on creating the office that today leads drug policy efforts, both parties should co-lead today\u0027s drug challenges based on what we know can work.Read Post | Comments (29)Bob Herbert, 09/03/12Distinguished Senior Fellow, DemosThe decline of the middle class was a result, in part, of public policy choices.
