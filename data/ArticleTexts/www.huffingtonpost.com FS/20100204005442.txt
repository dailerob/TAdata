{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOFor this month\u0027s HuffPost Book Club, I have chosen Jeremy Rifkin\u0027s The Empathic Civilization, which boldly sets out to present nothing less than -- as Rifkin puts it -- \"a new rendering of human history.\" This alternative history focuses not on the conflicts and power struggles that have marked human progress, but on \"the empathic evolution of the human race and the profound ways it has shaped our development.\" Empathy, Rifkin explains, is not a quaint behavior trotted out during intermittent visits to a food bank or during the Haiti telethon. Instead, it lies at the very core of human existence. Indeed, in this time of economic hardship, political instability, and rapid technological change, empathy is the one quality we most need if we\u0027re going to survive and flourish in the 21st century.Read Post | Comments (147)BIOJohn Kerry, 02.03.2010U.S. Senator from MassachusettsWe have come a long way as a country, and we have come a long way as a military to agree that allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military is the right thing to do.Read Post | Comments (199)BIOSec.
