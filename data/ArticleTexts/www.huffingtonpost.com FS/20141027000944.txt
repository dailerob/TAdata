{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, Ebola arrived in New York City -- America\u0027s most crowded and most media-saturated metropolis. So, as word spread on Thursday, so did the hysteria. But thankfully, Ebola (or \"Ebowla,\" as some christened it in honor of the infected doctor\u0027s sporting foray the night before his symptoms appeared) remains much harder to spread than rumor and misinformation. As threats go, Americans have a greater chance of dying from a bee sting than catching Ebola. Meanwhile, Canadians are dealing with this week\u0027s deadly shooting in Ottawa. The media response there stood in stark contrast to ours. Any changes, The Globe and Mail wrote, should not be \"as a panicky reaction to a very small number of men\" who \"are not an existential threat.\" We could learn much from our northern neighbors. As we heed NY Mayor de Blasio\u0027s warning to stay calm, we should also remember Montaigne, who said, \"There were many terrible things in my life, but most of them never happened.\"On the whole, is American exceptionalism a force for good? The question shouldn\u0027t be hard to answer. To make an exception of yourself is as immoral a proceeding for a nation as it is for an individual. When we say of a person (usually someone who has gone off the rails), \"He thinks the rules don\u0027t apply to him,\" we mean that he is a danger to others and perhaps to himself.Professor of Literature, Yale UniversityI have worn Oscar de la Renta\u0027s signature fragrance, Oscar, my whole adult life, and I will stay forever devoted and will wear him to my grave. Gentle, soft, feminine, chic, elegant. His style. My scent. Words I attribute to us both.Actress and children\u0027s book authorIf there is ever going to be a solution to the problem of the Islamic State that has a hope of preserving the current geo-political structure of Mesopotamia and the Levant, it rests with the survival of Bashar al-Assad\u0027s regime and the resurgence of Syria as a viable national player in the region.Author, \u0027Dangerous Ground\u0027We live in a world where as many as 440,000 Americans die each year because of preventable medical mistakes. With Prop 46, California voters can do what the politicians and the status-quo crowd won\u0027t: Nudge our healthcare system toward safer practices, deter doctor substance abuse and hold negligent physicians accountable.President, Brockovich Research \u0026 ConsultingThe VA\u0027s shortage of therapists and difficulty reaching rural veterans means even those diagnosed may not get all the help they need. But even those who were diagnosed and treated find that at some point, therapy has done all it can do. More sessions won\u0027t necessarily help. From that point on, veterans say, their lives become a matter of coping.Senior Military Correspondent, The Huffington PostThe conversation about privilege threatens to cut off the legs of the feminist movement before it can even crawl (yes -- crawl, we\u0027re in 2014 and birth control is seen by many as a dirty word.) Privilege is weighing us down. By us I mean all of us -- all feminists.Host and producer, HuffPost LiveIndictment for criminal acts should not be directed at one particular religion. The ultimate culprit is our human natures -- individual and social. Or, if you prefer, the Heavenly Father who created such conflicted and flawed creatures.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghWhen you cover the story, don\u0027t forget to mention West Africa. Lead with it, focus on it, keep people up to speed with what\u0027s happening there. Talk to the people fighting the disease there. Ask policymakers tough questions about what they\u0027re going to do about it. And if you write some listicle about Ebola, end with it. Because that\u0027s where the media can do the most good right now.Editor, Eat the PressThe claims coming from the mouths of our elected representatives showcase an incredibly wide array of pseudo-scientific criticism directed at the contemporary understanding of climate change.Author of the forthcoming book, DRIVING CHANGE: Combating Climate Change with Cleaner, Smarter Cars, and former Director of the Office of Transportation Air Quality at the US EPAThink of Ebola as the universe\u0027s unfair challenge to everything that war bred in our governmental system. As it happens, those things that the U.S. did, often ineffectively and counterproductively, to thwart its enemies, potential enemies, and even its own citizenry will not be an antidote to this \"enemy\" either.Director, Center on National Security at Fordham Law SchoolDoing something stupid is not always better than doing nothing. And imposing a travel ban is high on the list of stupid things. Apart from what this would do to efforts to contain Ebola in the countries now suffering from the epidemic, there is the more basic problem that it won\u0027t work.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027We have seen everything from historic droughts and extreme wildfires ravaging communities in California, to vanishing wildlife habitat in Alaska, to toxic algae blooming out of control and contaminating drinking water supplies in America\u0027s heartland. How much more do we need to know about the devastating effects of climate change before Congress takes action?U.S. Senator from CaliforniaWhile gun violence can happen anywhere, as Ottawa shows, it happens much more in the United States than any other developed country. Why the discrepancy? The full answer is complicated, but one of the driving factors is not.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersThe new generation of women at work has been peeled, prodded and parsed from every angle -- their education, their numbers, their issues, their needs, their frustrations. But you would be hard-pressed to find one illuminating equivalent study on the male side of the gender divide.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarI\u0027m not worried about Ebola. I\u0027m worried about America. I\u0027m worried about our confidence and courage.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027For the past five years, I essentially suffered in silence because I wanted to believe I was the same person I was before the attack. I refused to acknowledge it because I didn\u0027t want to be known as the girl who was raped her freshman year.Writer, artist, and activist.At this moment there is no Ebola epidemic in the United States. But some have tried -- quite intentionally -- to create an epidemic of fear and panic for their own political gain. That is irresponsible and reprehensible.Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersImmigration enforcement officials, or ICE, took my husband, after having overstayed his visa by 20 days. He was caught going ten miles over the speed limit, and now awaits deportation after a month-long incarceration.International development workerWhen will there be a good news day? One news day where the news is so good that it is the story of the day. A day that excites all Americans, whether they are Republicans, Democrats, or any other political persuasion. The news is so good that all the news coverage is overwhelmed by this wonderful event.Academy Award-winning director, screenwriter and producerFor the first time in 13 years, the DOE now makes clear that states, school districts, and schools must make education resources equally available to all students without regard to race, color, or national origin. This is some of the unfinished business of the civil rights movement and a giant step forward for poor children, often children of color.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundWhile it is true that, by far, the overwhelming percentage of black people in the South were doomed to spend their entire lives in slavery prior to the Civil War, it is also true that a small percentage lived as free citizens. And some were even able to prosper.Alphonse Fletcher University Professor and Director of the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research at Harvard UniversityGenealogist and senior product manager at Ancestry.comEbola-hawking candidates are trying for a bait and switch, but my bet\u0027s on women. Voting for someone who plays on Ebola fears while denying female workers a chance at equal pay is a fool\u0027s game -- and female voters are not fools.Money Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsAs a gay man who has been with my partner for almost 13 years and married for almost two, it felt nice to hear these two Christian groups making an effort towards gay people. But the feeling didn\u0027t last long.Executive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostMany take our freedom of speech for granted, especially in a noisy election season, or when the Supreme Court denigrates its importance through decisions like Citizens United. But for too many victims, the freedom to speak up about the nightmare of domestic violence is still a dream.Candidate for CA State Senate SD-26When I have an opportunity to mentor someone, I find the most important thing is to listen to them when they tell you about themselves. That will always give you an idea of what type of support they need.Seven-time NBA All StarOne of the greatest deceptions we can fall victim to is the lie that we should need someone else in our life in order to be complete. We are set up waiting for Mr. or Mrs. right to come along so that we can begin our life and be truly happy.Writer, business owner, mother; barefootlive.comWith continued officer-involved shootings, attempts at voter suppression, and ongoing racial and economic disparities, it is easy to push voting to the side. But it is precisely because of tragedies like the deaths of young Michael Brown in Ferguson and Eric Garner in Staten Island, and because of an unequal educational and employment system, that we need to show up at the polls.President, National Action NetworkAs a first-time mom, I\u0027ve come to this simple realization: If you are worried that you\u0027re not a good parent, trust me, that makes you an amazing parent. It\u0027s the parents who don\u0027t worry that we should be worried about.A Mobile Community for ParentsIn its structure of combining selection and election, the emergent Hong Kong system is a kind of middle way between democratic consent and the idea of meritocratic guidance. In fact, the mechanism proposed to choose a chief executive is not so different from the Electoral College designed by American democracy\u0027s Founding Fathers. The idea, spelled out in Federalist Paper #68, was to \"refine and enlarge the public views by passing them through the medium of a chosen body of citizens.\" But there needs to be a proper balance not yet achieved in Hong Kong.Editor-in-chief, THEWORLDPOSTI thought it was all about big boys, who should have known better, shaking me down for candy. Then again, some things don\u0027t make sense until you\u0027ve lived them with your own child -- and not a moment sooner.Writer, hospice volunteer and whitewater kayakerGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"WHITE HOUSE: END IT",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
