{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOAt a recent dinner, a group of us began talking about the huge chasm between the record profits of Wall Street banks and America\u0027s struggling Main Street banks and started discussing what concrete steps individuals could take to help create a better financial system. Eventually, an idea took hold: why don\u0027t we take our money out of these big banks and put them into community banks? And what, we asked ourselves, would happen if lots of people around America decided to do the same thing? To help this idea go viral, filmmaker Eugene Jarecki has created a powerful, and inspiring video playing off the classic film It\u0027s a Wonderful Life in which community banker George Bailey is nearly destroyed by the rapacious and predatory banker Mr. Potter. Check it out, and see why we think you should make it your New Year\u0027s resolution to move your money. Too-big-to-fail banks are profiting from bailout dollars and government guarantees, and growing bigger. Tell us which community bank you use, and why.
