{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Award-Winning Author of Freestyle: Reflections on Faith, Family, Justice, and Pop Culture; Founding Pastor of Joy Tabernacle A.M.E. Church in Dallas, TexasIt would be the grossest of errors to look upon the uprisings in Baltimore solely in the context of Baltimore. What has occurred there is but the next chapter in a centuries-old American narrative in which unarmed Black women and men are killed in the custody of police officers. Multitudes have protested peacefully in Baltimore and around the nation. Yet, a question now arises as to what should be done in response to the violent protests presently unfolding on the streets. Mortals are defined by limitations. Baltimore is but a sign of a people who can take no more. While we may not agree with the response, we cannot overlook the cause of the response.Everything about the Thrive eCourse, beginning this Sunday, May 3rd, on Oprah.com, is designed to help you be more connected with yourself and those around you, more productive and more present in everything that matters to you. And we have an amazing roster of guest teachers -- including NBA superstar Kobe Bryant, Warby Parker co-CEO Dave Gilboa, and happiness lecturer Shawn Achor -- to help you on your thriving journey.Any people with nothing to lose will destroy anything in their way. Like anything. Any people who feel as if their lives are not valued, like they are second-class citizens at best, will not be stopped until they\u0027ve made their point.Public speaker and activist; author, \u0027Barack Obama, Ronald Reagan, and the Ghost of Dr. King: Blogs and Essays\u0027As the war on terror nears its 14th anniversary -- a war we seem to be losing, given jihadist advances in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen -- the U.S. sticks stolidly to its strategy of \"high-value targeting,\" our preferred euphemism for assassination.Editor, Harper’s Magazine; Author, \u0027Kill Chain: The Rise of the High-Tech Assassins\u0027President Obama recently downplayed the impact of unfair trade on the U.S. workforce, arguing that many manufacturing jobs are low-paying. But I disagree. This nation\u0027s manufacturing base provides a pathway to prosperity for many Americans -- and this administration cannot shut the door on their future.General President, International Brotherhood of TeamstersIf you missed it, our kickoff Know Your Value event in Philadelphia, PA was a huge success! These women are givers -- and so we\u0027re going to give them the opportunity to grow their sense of personal and professional value. I can\u0027t wait to see what the next Know Your Value event in Washington, D.C. has in store.Co-host, MSNBC’s \u0027Morning Joe\u0027President Obama must be having trouble getting the votes for fast-track authority since the administration is now pulling out all the stops to push the deal. Obama insisted the deal is not secret, but googling \"TPP\" will not get you a copy of the text.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027What we won\u0027t hear so much this week is the story of the Vietnamese, the burned out villages, the bombed dams, the five million people displaced, the promiscuous use of napalm and Agent Orange (which still ravages Vietnamese), the three million dead.Executive Director, MIT Center for International StudiesThe rise of violent extremism is only at the early stages, and if the West wants to stem the flow of volunteers to these ruthless groups, Western countries should make a concerted effort to engage and understand the nuances of their Muslim communities, especially the families from which these volunteers are coming.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUForty-four percent of reported sexual assaults take place before the victim is 18. And yet, secondary schools remain woefully unprepared and irresponsibly reluctant to act on this information.Feminist, writer, and satirist (not always in that order)Pakistan lost a beloved, courageous leader last Friday night. If there is one thing that everyone who had the privilege of knowing Sabeen Mahmud understood, it is that above all else, she loved Pakistan and believed it was a country worth fighting for?--?and, in her case, tragically, worth dying for.Founder and CEO of AcumenTo think that Abercrombie \"got away\" with celebrating everyone being \"the same\" in a very diverse world for this long is astounding.Writer, Champagne Sipper, French-Fry Lover, Curly-Haired PersonSubtly, over time, David Letterman changed the entire tone of American television. And today that tone is more honest and authentic than ever before.Freelance Writer and Stand-Up ComedianBruce Jenner said he was afraid of \"disappointing people.\" Bruce, have no fear -- you didn\u0027t. You transcended the tawdry, and informed millions of Americans.Executive Director, Gender Rights MarylandWhen I die, don\u0027t weep for me as if I am gone. Whisper my name to someone beside you. Whisper it loud, so my name will be carried on the air to all corners of the earth.Author of Not Even My Name, and A Lid for Every Pot, painter, former WBAI news correspondent.Our justice system is weighted toward keeping families together. Children are often sent back to abusive homes on the principle of the sanctity of family. But this was not the case with my family. In my son\u0027s eyes, his father is a superhero. Yet for over a decade now, my government has thrown up roadblock after roadblock to keep them apart.Legislative advisorBig economies around the world have a huge opportunity to double the fuel efficiency of one of the largest sources of carbon emissions.Head of the heavy-duty vehicles program of the International Council on Clean TransportationIt was the curse of Kathmandu, a city of beautiful temples nestled in a valley, where there is so much clay in the ground that when the monsoon rains come, the tarless streets become a pool of mud.Journalist, HuffPost SpainYou don\u0027t like gay marriage? Fine. Don\u0027t get gay-married. But if you want to have a business and operate in the public sphere, then you\u0027ve got to treat all your fellow citizens equally. Even better would be to treat each of them as you would wish to be treated. That\u0027s a rule that should sound familiar to someone as knowledgeable of the New Testament as Bobby Jindal.Author of \u0027Obama’s America: A Transformative Vision of Our National Identity\u0027Have you ever seen one of those movies in which someone wakes up as a ghost but they don\u0027t know that they\u0027ve died? I couldn\u0027t make a sign or a sound to let anyone know I\u0027d become aware again. I was invisible -- the ghost boy.New York Times bestselling author of \u0027Ghost Boy: The Miraculous Escape of a Misdiagnosed Boy Trapped Inside His Own Body\u0027 www.GhostBoyBook.comCan state officials or the media really be surprised that promises of an internal investigation don\u0027t appease? The true state of emergency now, like back in 1968, isn\u0027t rage or even rock throwing. It is the racial profiling and racial brutality of the police. America\u0027s real state of emergency remains that black lives still don\u0027t matter enough.Historian writing on the history, politics, and current impact of incarceration in AmericaDo you think \"vacation\" equals Las Vegas resort or New York City adventure? Would you use a public bathroom on a long flight? Your answers show your party lines more clearly than you could have imagined.The fastest, easiest way to plan travel. www.hipmunk.comThe very wealthy are disproportionately opposed to any policy -- including tax policies -- that would redistribute wealth more equitably. This makes sense from a purely economic perspective. But is there more to it than rational self-interest?Author, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027It\u0027s becoming hard to remember how difficult the struggle was just a few years ago. America today is in a very different place from 2004, when voters in 13 states amended their state constitutions to exclude us from marriage.Director of the ACLU Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender \u0026 AIDS ProjectFor politicians, the message is clear: making the rounds on the Sunday morning news programs is no longer good enough. The lesson is no less clear for advertisers who rely on the same eyeballs. The advertising industry should take this as a sign that online video is a worthy investment.VP, Brand Strategy and Development, The Huffington PostDealing with motherhood with acceptance and a sense of humor has often been my saving grace, and I thought this picture captured that perfectly. I didn\u0027t post it to make a huge statement about motherhood. I posted it to share my truth as a mom and help my mom friends feel comfortable with their truth.I\u0027m a mom, wife, foodie, naturalista and more. I\u0027ve got opinions about everything and rarely admit to being wrong. Just ask my husband.My life is proof that we can change the future of thousands of youth forced into homelessness by simply valuing their lives, making investments into their futures, and recognizing that they are worth more than a few bucks and some leftover lunch. I am worth something -- and so is every other homeless youth.Social Worker, Advocate, Survivor, and Changer of the WorldBeing an entrepreneur is not for everyone, and in a way I\u0027m grateful for starting out so young.

During oral argument, the justices aren\u0027t interested in educating the citizenry.Professor of Law, UCLALooking at this picture, I have to pause. I look at me -- past vs. present. People say they do not recognize the girl in the other pictures. I\u0027m here to say: that girl is me. Don\u0027t speak of her as if she is a poor, piteous person. She\u0027s not. She\u0027s me. She\u0027s standing right here, and she is f***ing strong.I\u0027ve been committed to maintaining a healthy lifestyle since I began my weight-loss journey, which has since become a life-gaining journey.We high schoolers spend 40 hours a week at these institutions -- we ought to be learning about these things somewhere.
