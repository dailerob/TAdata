Muggeridge suggested that many eyewitnesses see things with the \"glass eye\" they have fixed into their skulls -- and then fervently believe what this glass eye registers. Surely John McCain was seeing with the \"surge is working\" glass eye he has fixed in his skull when he told a town hall crowd this week, \"We\u0027re succeeding.

His fundamental virtue is never questioned.Read Post | Comments (48)BIODavid Wild, 03.27.2008For some reason, my wife and I never got around to baking brownies for Britney Spears and bringing them over in a welcome wagon.Read Post | CommentsBIOLorelei Kelly, 03.27.2008The military understands that we need to move toward persuasion and away from coercion as our guiding principle.
