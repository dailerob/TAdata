{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week, the White House sought to thrust the nation into military action in the Middle East, claiming that its \"high confidence\" in our intelligence obviated the need to allow U.N. inspectors to complete their work. Sound familiar? It\u0027s like a bad summer sequel, with many of the same actors. But like the original, there are many holes in the plot. If \"there is no action,\" the president proclaimed, \"that is a danger to our national security.\" But he didn\u0027t say how. Also unexplained: What happens after we strike? Since the decision has been made not to take out Assad, how exactly are we \"holding him accountable\"? By killing innocent people who had nothing to do with the attack? That actually does affect our security. This time, however, the Coalition of the Unwilling -- one that goes beyond left vs. right -- is much larger. Urging action, John Kerry cautioned: \"It is directly related to our credibility.\" On that he is 100 percent right.Comments (323)David BromwichProfessor of Literature, Yale UniversityThere may now be a hope, through Congress, of putting a definitive stop to a thoughtless policy in Syria. It can be done by a vote of no confidence in \"humanitarian war\" which only augments the violence of the warring sects of the Middle East.Comments (783)John PavleyCTO @ The Huffington Post, BloggerFor the HuffPost community to grow and develop we must emphasize fairness in access, promote civil discourse,  reduce vitriol on our pages and provide a defense against trolling. A key strategy in doing all of this is our plan to require all new members to identify themselves when they create an account.Comments (459)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundJanol\u0027s good grades allowed him to attend an excellent magnet high school but he realized he didn\u0027t see his own experience reflected in the curriculum. He wants to see a new kind of teacher training become a priority throughout the educational system.Comments (393)Arianna HuffingtonSolvitur ambulando -- \"it is solved by walking.\" This phrase refers to the 4th century Greek philosopher Diogenes\u0027s response to the question of whether motion is real -- he got up and walked. \"It is solved by walking.\" As it turns out, there are many other problems to which walking is the solution.Comments (202)Kirk DouglasActorI haven\u0027t smoked in over 40 years (I am 96 years old). Of all the drugs, smoking has the highest death rate -- more than 400,000 people per year (which is more than AIDS, alcohol, car accidents, illegal drugs, murders and suicides combined). Stop smoking and live longer!Comments (350)Jamie Lee CurtisActress and children\u0027s book authorAs we pause, and broil or grill or just sit and watch a ball game with our friends and family, let us remember those who have worked and struggled and died for us, for us to be better people individually as well as better people as a nation.Comments (48)Mohamed A.

So let us all take at least one lesson from King\u0027s example. Let\u0027s unite people of many faiths in a national day of prayer to end child poverty.Comments (66)Michael SteelePolitical analyst; Fmr. Chairman, Republican National Committee; Fmr. Lt. Governor, MarylandDr. King\u0027s speech challenged the status quo of his time and now so must we. But we must first answer for our generation the question often asked of him: \u0027When will you be satisfied?\u0027Comments (177)Christy Turlington BurnsFounder, Every Mother Counts, Director/Producer, NO WOMAN, NO CRY, global maternal health advocate, mom, modelEven though Haitian women are considered the \"poto mitan\"-- the \"central pillars\" of the family and their communities -- they are often the most underserved members of already poor communities.CommentsAlec BaldwinActorJulie Harris\u0027 voice was like rainfall.

Shouldn\u0027t Labor Day be a time to gather, contemplate and celebrate more just treatment of all those who toil without proper recognition or compensation?Comments (126)Suzanne PerrymanBlogger at SpecialNeedsMom.comIn your hurry to keep things neat and orderly, you didn\u0027t see the whole picture. You didn\u0027t see the wheelchair lift permanently installed into the back of my SUV, and you didn\u0027t see me unload my little girl\u0027s pink manual wheelchair that we use for \"quick\" trips.Comments (7,460)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027The dream was more than the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act, which both followed in the years after the history-changing 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. It finally was about King\u0027s vision for \"the beloved community.\"Comments (32)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarWhat\u0027s different about Cyrus\u0027s performance, which seems to have generated an unprecedented level of outrage, is not its by-now old-hat hypersexuality but its particular seaminess. Cyrus was sexual, de rigueur in pop performances, but also more than a little repelling.Comments (316)Joshua PragerAuthor, JournalistIt was not until last month -- 23 years later -- that I considered that my visions in the intensive care unit were related to the visions that had come upon me, off and on, in the years since.Comments (84)Thomas E. PerezU.S. Secretary of LaborLet\u0027s use Labor Day 2013 as an opportunity to reflect on the men and women whose heads, hearts and hands have made ours the strongest economy the world has ever known.Comments (54)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistHe had come to Washington that day, he said, to cash a check. \"When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence,\" he announced to the crowd of 250,000 on the National Mall, \"they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir.\"CommentsRev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkHalf a century after Dr. King\u0027s momentous march, we must continue to push for justice and equality; anything less will be a disservice to the memory of this great leader and all those that paved the way 50 years ago.Comments (406)Sec. Kathleen Sebelius and Sec. Arne DuncanNo matter where any of us happens to live; no matter how young or old we happen to be, or whether we\u0027d rather be shooting hoops or playing video games, we never know when we\u0027ll need insurance. An injury, illness, or accident can strike anyone, at any time.Comments (88)Bernard-Henri LévyFrench philosopher and writerIs Putin is a paper tiger? A jacked and ripped Popeye? A bluffer who will not run the risk of imperiling the Olympic Games in Sochi? History, obviously, is no guide. In such moments of suspense, there is no ready-made or risk-free solution.Comments (54)Bill MoyersManaging Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyWe are so close to losing our democracy to the mercenary class, it\u0027s as if we are leaning way over the rim of the Grand Canyon and all that\u0027s needed is a swift kick in the pants.

However, we all should wait to see the report of the United Nations inspectors before action is taken. The political dynamics are running ahead of due process.Comments (436)Leo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersAmerica cannot afford to return to the days when only the scions of the wealthiest could attend college. The nation is most prosperous when prosperity is most shared.Comments (44)Steve WiensPastor, writer, runnerBy far the best moment every day was when the kids were finally in bed, and the adults all gathered upstairs to laugh, moan about our sore, aging bodies, and relive every precious part of that day.Comments (80)Mary SchmidtWriter, Bay Area1. Most of the time, you don\u0027t know anything about anything. That was true when you were 15 and that will be true when you are 65. You do, however, know how to be a good person and you know how to follow your heart. Keep doing that and you\u0027ll be just fine.Comments (44)Scott Barry Kaufman, Ph.D.Author, \u0027Ungifted: Intelligence Redefined\u0027; co-founder, The Creativity PostWhile introversion, sensitivity, and narcissism are all partially separate traits, hypersensitive covert narcissists are more likely to report that they are introverted and sensitive.Comments (196)Ella Frances SandersIntern, MaptiaAs Friedrich Nietzsche said, \"Words are but symbols for the relations of things to one another and to us; nowhere do they touch upon the absolute truth.\" Here, illustrated, are 11 words whose concepts cannot be properly explained across cultures.Comments (232)Marty KaplanDirector, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolWe may not get a great debate about international norms and national security.
