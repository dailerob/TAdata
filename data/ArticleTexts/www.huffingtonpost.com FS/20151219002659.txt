{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Author, research psychologist and gender scholarA new study released last week by the Virginia-based nonprofit Treatment Advocacy Center reported that people with untreated mental illness are 16 times more likely to be killed by police than people without. In fact, people with severe mental illness account for one in four of all fatal police encounters. One reason for this is that those suffering from mental disorders are more likely to come in contact with authority figures: Although less than four percent of the general population suffers from severe mental illness, they generate 10 percent of all calls for police services and they take up at least 20 percent of spots in American prisons -- where, it should be noted, they are often unable to get the care they need.In the wake of the Paris terror attacks of November, 13 that left 130 dead and the San Bernardino, Calif. terror attack of December 2 that killed 14 and left another 22 wounded, anti-Muslim hate crime attacks appear to have risen sharply across the United States to a level nearly three times the monthly average of the last five years.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityThe networks have grasped Donald Trump to their collective bosom like the winner of one of those misogynistic, televised beauty pageants he owns.

Former senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.It\u0027s increasingly clear that Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, Chair of the Democratic National Committee, isn\u0027t acting as a neutral party Chair, trying to insure a fair and democratic primary and building the Democratic Party in the states. Rather, she\u0027s acting as a shill for Hillary Clinton, doing everything in her power to ensure that no one will effectively challenge Hillary\u0027s coronation as the nominee.Entertainment attorney, writer and political activistSleep has been a part of HuffPost -- an obsession, really -- since we launched our dedicated sleep section in 2007, prompted by my own collapse from exhaustion and sleep deprivation.

And while some of the loudest and largest passengers on that omnibus include defense spending, tax reform, and homeland security, a number of critical animal causes fortunately found seats as well.ASPCA President and CEOEvery Student Succeeds Act represents a substantive shift: It returns a fair amount of control over education policy to the states.

Whiskey drinker. Mom.Let\u0027s downgrade them from \"joined at the hip\" to \"pretty good friends.\" This will enable us to pursue a more aggressive policy against ISIS, because the main constraint against doing so in the past has been our closeness to Saudi Arabia and Turkey, which have opposed an aggressive policy against ISIS.Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicyLee\u0027s new film, Chi-Raq, might not be \"likable\" but it definitely follows his previous films as it prompts viewers to think critically about unresolved tensions and problems in the film and the broader social world.Professor, Writer, Teacher, Freestyle artistIn September, the IRS proposed giving nonprofits the option of providing more information about people who contribute $250 or more.

We must make progress now and over the long-term to help families make ends meet.Former Secretary of Health and Human ServicesMy concern is not whether Trump really is a Christian, though I admit I have serious doubts. Rather, my concern is whether his stated views and beliefs line up with Christian thought. And it is clear that many of them do not.Philosopher, Author, SpeakerThe reality is that polls today contradict the belief that Clinton will run away with the nomination. Democrats won\u0027t vote for a candidate they don\u0027t trust, no matter how many poll say Sanders is behind Clinton.

And that impulse has nothing to do with your relationship status or whether or not you\u0027re the official host of the event.Author, It’s Not You: 27 (Wrong) Reasons You’re SingleIs your name worth so much, and guarded so tightly, that you can\u0027t spare the smallest part of it for Amber and KaJavia -- just as you can\u0027t spare even the slight platitude of \"thoughts and prayers\" for those they left behind?
