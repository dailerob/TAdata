On the first day of the new session, it put in place a rule change that would make it difficult to address the shortfall the program is projected to face sometime next year. Republican leaders like Sen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) justified this change by insisting that half the people getting disability had the sort of back aches and occasional anxieties that we all face. The difference is that they get checks from the government rather than working. For this reason, Rand argued the program is in serious need of reform. As several analysts quickly pointed out, there is no basis for Paul\u0027s assertion.A student debt \"jubilee\" would reflect both the values upon which this nation was founded, and the economic principles which have sustained it through its greatest periods of growth and prosperity.

A little too good, as far as Congress is concerned, which is why members and the corporate lobbyists who write them hefty checks have launched a last-ditch legislative effort to scuttle net neutrality.Senior writer, Moyers \u0026 Company on public TV.
