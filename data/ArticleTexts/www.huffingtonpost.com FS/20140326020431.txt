{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027In recent months, conservatives have been boasting about the strong job growth of red state Texas compared to the much weaker job growth of blue state California. They use this comparison to promote their line that low taxes and pro-business regulations are the key to low unemployment and prosperity. It\u0027s worth taking a closer look. First, the story is not simply one of Texas growth being driven by oil and gas, although its abundance of energy is clearly a factor. Using the business cycle peak in December of 1981 as a start point, employment has grown by 77.9 percent in Texas compared to just 59.0 percent in California. The 1981 start point is a good base of comparison because it was also a period when high energy prices were helping to drive the Texas economy.Comments (163)Bob CescaManaging Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowThere are some things that are unworthy of equal time. Ken Ham\u0027s ideas are fine in the context of a Sunday morning homily, but they don\u0027t belong in science class.

And he was anxious.CommentsMeghan RalstonHarm Reduction Manager, Drug Policy Alliance\"Addict\u0027\" is one of those words that so many of us use, largely without pausing to wonder if we should.

If the Supreme Court rules in favor of Hobby Lobby, the answer may well be \"yes.\"Comments (378)Peter WattsCommunications coach \u0026 commentatorWhen life hands you lemons, make lemonade.
