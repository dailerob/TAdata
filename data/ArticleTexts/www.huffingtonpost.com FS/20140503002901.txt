{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Mark GongloffChief financial writer, The Huffington PostWe\u0027ve spent endless hours this past week exploring the boneheaded racism of L.A. Clippers owner Donald Sterling. Too bad we probably won\u0027t pay nearly as much attention to the bias of our entire economy. The black unemployment rate was one of the bleakest features of an otherwise strong April jobs report on Friday, clocking in at 11.6 percent, compared with overall unemployment of 6.3 percent and more than twice the white unemployment rate of 5.3 percent. Hispanic or Latino unemployment was 7.3 percent. There has been a persistent gap between black and white workers since at least 1954. But it has widened since the end of the Great Recession, part of what National Urban League president Marc Morial recently called \"an economic crisis in Black America.\"Filmmaker Louie Schwartzberg uses time-lapse technology to show us unseen dimensions of life as we know it, from ocean currents to dragonfly wings. You\u0027ll never look at the world the same way again.TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"I\u0027m a young American, finishing my last year of college, looking down a road that gets bleaker every day.Cory BrooksSenior at George Washington UniversityHow do we get Millenials to understand the importance and benefit of a culture that also embraces the Thrive mentality?Diane PrimoChairman and Founder, IntraLink GlobalThe mass media mostly ignored the Common Core controversy until comedian Louis C.K. tweeted that his daughters used to love math, and now she hates it.Diane RavitchResearch Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027Payroll growth was strong and broad based last month and the jobless rate fell sharply, but that seemingly impressive decline in unemployment was wholly due to the shrinking labor force.Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorImagine a 10-person bicycle. Three people are pedaling, five are pretending to pedal, and two are jamming the brakes. That\u0027s you, corporate America. Here are three (of many) ways you can make life better at work.The Motley FoolTo Educate, Amuse \u0026 EnrichA Clinton-Bush election would be competitive, but would end in a victory for the political establishment. Whoever won that election would be well-prepared to govern and extremely familiar with Washington, the presidency and partisan politics, but bereft of any innovative approaches or comprehensive critiques of the political system.Lincoln Mitchelllincolnmitchell.comIn an effort to spare everyone the hard work of recreating the wheel next time round, I thought it would be easier to create the Fox News Boy Crisis Cheat SheetSoraya ChemalyFeminist, Writer, Satirist... not always in that orderAn important divide quickly reveals itself when we seek to interpret the significance of nature\u0027s many miracles. Some see causality, believing that only an invisible controlling agent could explain such wonders. Others see randomness, with no direction, purpose or meaning.Jeff SchweitzerScientist and former White House Senior Policy Analyst; Ph.D. in marine biology/neurophysiologyToday\u0027s action followed a historic 17-day sit-in at the St. Louis campus, where hundreds of Washington University students have joined in a campaign to remove Peabody Energy CEO Greg Boyce from the Board of Trustees, as part of other demands to cut university ties with the coal industry giant.Jeff BiggersAuthor of \u0027Reckoning at Eagle Creek: The Secret Legacy of Coal in the Heartland\"In recent years things have changed, the lobbying business is changing -- and a bit to our detriment, as it often promotes indecency and brings out the worst in people.Greta Van SusterenHost, Fox News\u0027 \u0027On the Record With Greta Van Susteren\u0027Experiencing grief can push us to our limits. Grief can push us past our limits and set new standards for our life going forward. It has amazing power.Karen SewellPhotographer, Magic Hour Foundation VolunteerThe Republican \"more drilling brings the price down\" argument clearly isn\u0027t working. It is, however, making oil companies a hefty profit at our taxpayer-subsidized expense. We need a better national strategy.Rep. Raúl M. GrijalvaCo-chair, Congressional Progressive CaucusAs humans, we\u0027re shaped by the experiences that get us outside our comfort zone. The rush of adrenaline that comes from a scare, a laugh, or pure repulsion causes our brains to record things more clearly than normal.Dan RiskinBiologist, TV host, and author of \u0027Mother Nature Is Trying to Kill You\u0027When Jordan heard her mother, Sarah, talk about the need for there to be more information available for children whose parents are living with cancer, she decided to write her own story.Emily DrakeHealth promotion specialist, researcher, advocateWhat is the best meaning of the word \"evangelical\"? Perhaps this: a deep belief in Jesus, a consistent commitment to follow Jesus, and a real love for Jesus -- one who applies Jesus\u0027 life and teachings to their everyday lives. By that definition, Glen Stassen was an evangelical -- the best kind.Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersJessica WatsonWriter, Four Plus an AngelWhen America stares into the mirror of education, we see our societal self staring right back. So I was particularly disturbed by a story about a kindergarten show in New York that was canceled so that the students could continue to work towards becoming \"college and career ready.\"Jason EndacottAssistant Professor of Social Studies, University of Arkansas; Blogger, EduSanityThis man (and the philosopher he introduced me to) changed my life and in a very significant way contributed to the person I ended up becoming.Ryan HolidayMedia strategistMothers bring life. Mothers bring caring. Mothers set the tone for the aspirations of the next generation.Helen ClarkAdministrator, United Nations Development ProgrammeThe theme of this year\u0027s batch of quarterbacks in the NFL draft should be \"pick your poison.\" All of the quarterback prospects, especially the top ones, come with a varied set of strengths and weaknesses.Hank KoeblerSports WriterBureaucracy kills the human spirit. It\u0027s that simple. A teacher who is forced to trudge through mindless protocols cannot possibly be enthusiastic. Inspiring students is impossible when the teacher is forced to act like a bureaucratic robot.Philip K. HowardAuthor, \u0027The Rule of Nobody: Saving America from Dead Laws and Broken Government\u0027When Barack Obama enters the geopolitical funhouse these days, the distorting mirrors reflect back very different images of the U.S. president.John FefferCo-director, Foreign Policy In FocusThere\u0027s no reason, in spite of the brutal nature of his crimes, that Lockett should have died in that practically medieval way. His penalty was death, not 24 minutes of what can only be defined as state-induced torture... and then eventual death. Torture wasn\u0027t part of the deal.Bob CescaManaging Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\"Monster is coming back,\" say Les Twins, adding, \"Les Twins doesn\u0027t work without Monster and Monster doesn\u0027t workout with Les Twins.\"Jessica SanohHuffPost Live associate producerAnjali JoshiEducator.
