{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027A speech delivered by Janet Yellen, vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, began by reminding the audience that the Fed\u0027s mandate is a society of high employment, not just low inflation. She made several important points that seem to have eluded President Obama -- all of which are implicit rebukes to the Administration\u0027s fiscally deflationary approach to the recovery. What sort of a topsy-turvy world is it when we have to look to the Federal Reserve, normally the home of inflation hawks and shills for commercial bankers, for ordinary common sense on the economic recovery?

Gerard, 02/18/13International President, United SteelworkersRig the Vote is the evil opposite of Rock the Vote.

Who are we to tell them they shouldn\u0027t be? The problem isn\u0027t with what TV news covers, it\u0027s with what it doesn\u0027t cover.
