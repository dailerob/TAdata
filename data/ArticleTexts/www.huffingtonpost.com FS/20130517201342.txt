{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"David BromwichProfessor of Literature at YaleThree scandals have converged in the past week to preoccupy Congress and the press. Benghazi was the first to come, and it has surprised by its staying power. The abuse of power by the IRS may be, in the long run, the most damaging of these cases for the Obama presidency, but its outlines are only beginning to emerge. But the ugliest of the scandals has come from the revelation of the justice department\u0027s seizure of two months of phone calls by 100 AP reporters. This was done to investigate the leak of a thwarted terrorist plot which the government itself had already decided to disclose in public. Different as they are, the scandals all point to a single disorder that afflicts the Obama White House and the Holder justice department. The name of the disorder is paternalism, and its leading symptoms are suppression and secrecy.Comments (334)Rebecca SaxeAssociate Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience, MITcooperating in large groups is a signature accomplishment of the human brain: among similar species, we are remarkably good at working together and negotiating our differences.Comments (48)Shelley EmlingEditor, Post 50Just because you\u0027ve been getting away with a social gaffe for decades doesn\u0027t mean you shouldn\u0027t stop making it. By the time you\u0027re 50, you should know a thing or two -- or 25 -- about etiquette.Comments (245)Sen. Kirsten GillibrandU.S. Senator from New YorkThe scourge of sexual violence in the military should be intolerable to all Americans and it\u0027s time to bring it to an end once and for all. We must commit ourselves not just to a zero tolerance policy, but we need to get to a point of zero occurrence.Comments (25)Arianna HuffingtonThis week, Jaweed Kaleem looks at threshold choirs, a growing movement using a capella song to soothe the dying. And Radley Balko puts the spotlight on Bisbee, Arizona, a town at the center of the state\u0027s debate over gay marriage.CommentsElliott NeginDirector of News \u0026 Commentary, Union of Concerned ScientistsDespite the fact that ExxonMobil is still a significant contrarian funder, the flurry of media interest in the company\u0027s funding agenda sparked by UCS\u0027s exposé died down soon after its release and remains feeble to this day. What happened?Comments (17)John PavleyCTO @ The Huffington Post, BloggerIt\u0027s the second day at Google I/O 2013 in San Francisco. While the other members of the HuffPost tech team on site have been pursuing sessions on Android and Google Glass, I\u0027ve been focused on something much more mundane: the World Wide Web.Comments (12)Tom Frieden, MD, MPH and Pamela HydeResearch has shown us that intervening early at the individual, family, and community level can delay or prevent the on-set of mental and substance use disorders. We also know that these can be treated, and individuals with these conditions can lead healthy productive lives.CommentsGeoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoI am a card-carrying member of the ACLU, a strong proponent of press freedom and a staunch believer in both a robust First Amendment and a vibrant Fourth Amendment. But I also care about rational public discourse, and the furious condemnation of the Department of Justice in this situation is way over the top.Comments (228)Christina HuffingtonIt\u0027s important for younger women to see that success does not prevent mental health issues and that mental health issues do not prohibit success.CommentsCarol HartsellSenior Comedy Editor, The Huffington PostYou hold in your hands a letter. Not an email, not a Facebook message, not a DM. An actual, physical missive. It is an epistle, of the ilk our fathers and their fathers once wrote. In short, this is a real \"brick and mortar\" affair you are looking at.CommentsLena DesmondFind a boy who travels because you deserve a life of adventure and possibility. You deserve to live light and embrace simplicity. He will live in every moment with you because this is how he lives his life. Together you will make the whole world your home.Comments (114)Bob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowThe congressional Republicans are outraged by the IRS story, but they haven\u0027t been able to scramble to the floor of the House quickly enough to target left-leaning groups.Comments (1,050)Barbara FicarraJournalist; Founder, Healthin30.com; Media broadcasterDo we all have the power of empathy? Are we hardwired to know what other people want? Is it easy to think about other people\u0027s thoughts?CommentsMichael ZakarasWriter and strategist who specializes in social entrepreneurship and public policyIn our efforts to solve difficult social problems in particular, we rely too heavily on reason and numbers and econometrics, and not often enough on empathy. And by empathy I don\u0027t just mean our emotions, and I certainly don\u0027t mean feeling sorry -- that\u0027s sympathy.Comments (116)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistI was as stunned as everyone else by Angelina Jolie\u0027s revelation on Tuesday that she\u0027d had a double mastectomy to reduce her risk of developing breast cancer. That\u0027s not only because one of the most famous women in the world had managed to keep such a dramatic secret under wraps for so long (although that is pretty amazing).Comments (248)Mark E. Robson, M.D.Attending Physician, Clinic Director, Clinical Genetics Service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer CenterI have been involved in research in this area for 17 years, since shortly after BRCA1 and BRCA2 were discovered, and I have no idea what I would do if I were a woman faced with this decision. The diagnosis of a mutation is just words on paper, but the risks they foreshadow are very real.Comments (39)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027Violence against women is the most prevalent and the most hidden injustice in our world today. It\u0027s time for all people of faith to be outraged. It\u0027s time for our Christian leaders to stand up and say that women, made in the very image of God, deserve better.CommentsBob BurnettBerkeley writer, retired Silicon Valley executiveRepublican policy no longer represents the teachings of Jesus. The GOP favors the rich and ignores the poor, disadvantaged, sick, elderly, long-term unemployed, and other unfortunates. Republicans may be religious, but they\u0027re not Christians.Comments (316)Rob WatsonDad, LGBT activist and businessmanThe Friday before Mother\u0027s Day, my work associate asked me for a favor. \"I may need to work altered hours on Monday, if that is OK,\" she started. \"I have a memorial service that I need to go to.\" And then, almost under her breath: \"It was a suicide.\"Comments (115)Brenda RayHalf the Sky Movement crew memberEdna Adan not only trains mid-wives so they can return to their rural environment and provide pre-natal and birthing support, but also teaches them to carry with them the message that genital mutilation of any girl or woman does not serve them.CommentsBeth WoolseyWriter, humorist at the Five Kids Is A Lot of Kids blogIf you pay attention, kids will teach you how to laugh loudly, how to love deeply and how to live fully. They will also ruin all your stuff.Comments (35)Jonathan AppelAssociate Professor of Psychology and Criminal Justice, Tiffin UniversityThere is an order or organization in destructive human behavior which can be illuminated with research and clinical observation -- and can have many implications for intervention. Neuroscience is providing a major piece of the puzzle towards this understanding -- but only a piece.CommentsRichard BrodskySenior Fellow, DemosThe litany of Congressional Republican nuttiness in the past 20 years is impressive. Think back on assertions that Hilary Clinton was involved in murdering Vince Foster and Whitewater, and the Mother Of All Scandals the Lewinsky/impeachment saga.Comments (27)Gene MarksSmall business management columnist, author, speaker, and business ownerWe know you\u0027ve been doing it for years now, so why hide anymore? Instead, just tell the public what you\u0027re doing is yet another service you\u0027re providing, particularly if you concentrate on those groups that really make our lives worse.Comments (16)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Wall Street excesses brought the economy to the brink of collapse. But now the Wall Street behemoths are bigger than ever and President Obama is looking to cut the Social Security benefits of retirees. That will teach the Wall Street boys to be more responsible in the future.Comments (527)Sec. Kathleen SebeliusSecretary of Health and Human ServicesToday, for nearly the 40th time since it\u0027s been the law of the land, House Republicans staged yet another repeal vote in their latest attempt to turn back the clock on progress and deny Americans health insurance coverage they can count on.Comments (350)Kate FlanneryActress, The OfficeEveryone keeps asking what I am going to do now that The Office is ending. I liberated myself on live radio by simply saying, \"I\u0027m gonna kill myself.\"Comments (60)Hannah BrownAuthor, \"If I Could Tell You\"I asked if he had brushed his teeth, knowing he hadn\u0027t gone into the bathroom, and he grinned at me, saying, \"Yeah!\" In the parallel universe of autism parenthood, I jumped for joy and called his therapist to share the good news.CommentsWINGSFamily planning education and reproductive health services in GuatemalaGuatemala is ranked a dismally low 116 out of 135 countries for gender equality. We strongly believe that family planning is crucial to supporting the gender equality of Guatemalan women.CommentsRicky GervaisActor, writer, comedian, director, producerI am so proud of The Ricky Gervais Show. Not just because of how well it turned out or how successful it was, or the awards, or even how much fun I had producing it.Comments (35)Jim Worth, 2013.17.05Steven Suskin, 2013.17.05Bruce Reyes-Chow, 2013.17.05Robin Amos Kahn, 2013.17.05John Fiege, 2013.17.05Tony Woodcock, 2013.17.05Elisabeth MacNamara, 2013.17.05Lillian Medville, 2013.17.05Julia Kurnia, 2013.17.05Kenneth Barish, Ph.D., 2013.17.05Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"\u0027BUNGA BUNGA\u0027 PARTIES HAD \u0027OBAMA\u0027 SHOWGIRLS",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
