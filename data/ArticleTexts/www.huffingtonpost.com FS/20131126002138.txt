{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The Senate Democrats\u0027 long-deferred success in reforming the filibuster rule for executive branch and judicial appointments will have reverberations that are only gradually being appreciated. Not only will 76 long-blocked appointments -- a record -- now go forward in short order. Obama, if he chooses, will be able to appoint more robust progressives. One of the best pieces of news in the filibuster story was the report that Obama personally got into the act, working the phones to help enlist the last few Democratic votes for reform. This may bode well for more hands-on leadership by a president whose trademark has been reticence.Comments (336)George LakoffAuthor, \u0027The Political Mind,\u0027 \u0027Moral Politics\u0027 and \u0027Don\u0027t Think of an Elephant!\u0027The NY Times has many virtues and some important flaws.

Bring your kids to these inspirational museums of science, industry, and technology.Comments (1)Rachelle FriedmanBlogger; speaker; ambassador for the spinal cord injury communityIf you\u0027ve said any of these, don\u0027t feel bad (unless you\u0027ve stolen a handicap parking spot!). We aren\u0027t angry or offended, but we want people to understand.Comments (403)Leo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersThis Thanksgiving will be very different for too many American workers. They won\u0027t share in the bounty they helped create.Comments (142)Linda TiradoNight Cook, Essayist, ActivistComing up with enough money that you are comfortable is the real American dream, and it is one that the people I am used to don\u0027t believe in as much as hope hard for. I have spent my life on the margins due to my own actions and an equal amount of things that I cannot control.Comments (388)Sheila MoeschenSenior Editor I AM THAT GIRL, Freelance writer\"What about Thanksgiving?\" you cry in rage. Where is Thanksgiving\u0027s contribution to the expanding sexualization of holidays? Am I a weirdo, you ask, to think that Thanksgiving should be another day like all the others set aside for national recognition that encourages me to get my freak on?Comments (16)Wendell PotterAuthor, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgThe latest polls on Obamacare are bleak. But those poll numbers will change as more people are finally able to shop for coverage on the new health insurance websites -- and find coverage that is surprisingly affordable.Comments (183)Lee MendelsonEmmy-winning producer-writer-directorBack in 1963, when I was honored to produce a documentary on cartoonist Charles Schulz, I couldn\u0027t have imagined that half a century later I\u0027d be marking another milestone.CommentsMarlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistOne of the best parts of Thanksgiving for me is re-watching some of the classic holiday blunders that have been depicted on television. Whether dealing with the drama of in-laws or botching a traditional family recipe, these are some of my absolute favorite outrageous Thanksgiving blunders on TV.CommentsEmma Seppala, Ph.DAssociate Director, Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and EducationIn order to understand where you fit in and how to best navigate your relationships with others, here\u0027s a summary of the three styles of romantic partners.Comments (113)Marty KaplanDirector, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolThe Geneva deal may turn out to advance America\u0027s Middle East interests; it may be a historic blunder; it may make no difference. But as we lay odds on those outcomes, it\u0027s useful to recall that the lessons of history are more art than science, and the art is the skill of the storyteller.CommentsClaire FallonDeputy Blog Editor, The Huffington PostI\u0027ve lost count of how many times I\u0027ve read Pride and Prejudice. I\u0027ve even lost count of how many copies of it I\u0027ve owned over the yearsCommentsDavid J. EicherEditor-in-Chief, Astronomy magazineAs astronomers who have been watching the comet know, however, the past few days -- and the next few days -- will not be the best ones to try to catch the comet.CommentsPaul KrassnerAuthor and SatiristIn my new Medicare Advantage Enrollment Kit, there are listed a few thousand prescription drugs, from Abacavir to Zyvox. Okay, now cue that soothing voiceover to recite all their side effects, from anal leakage to zits.CommentsJoe HansenInternational President, United Food and Commercial Workers UnionThe \"Walmart Economy\" is a disaster for most Americans. That\u0027s why we should all be thankful that, during this holiday season, Walmart workers across the country are again leading the fight to change the way Walmart does business.CommentsRebecca SmithDeputy Director, National Employment Law ProjectThanksgiving is one of our most treasured national holidays. But while most of us will spend it sitting down to a sumptuous dinner in the company of our loved ones, some of us will be stocking shelves and working the shop floor.Comments (153)Dr. Joel HoffmanAuthor, Speaker, and ScholarThis month, Hanukkah and Thanksgiving will overlap for a joint celebration that will never happen again. Here\u0027s why.Comments (11)Dr. Josef OlmertAdjunct Professor, University of South CarolinaA realignment of Middle East politics? That remains to be seen, but it is more likely than before with the signing of the agreement, and one with potential effects that could go beyond the immediate Iranian connection.Comments (32)Helen ClarkAdministrator, United Nations Development ProgrammeToday is the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women -- a day which reminds us that violence against women continues to be destructive and pervasive.CommentsTom EngelhardtEditor, TomDispatch.comDon\u0027t call this America a \"police state,\" not given what that came to mean in the previous century, nor a \"totalitarian\" state, given what that meant back then. The truth is that we have no appropriate name, label, or descriptive term for ourselves.Comments (134)Amy EphronAuthorWhether you\u0027re making your own or using a canned variety, here\u0027s one way to spice up your cranberry sauce.CommentsRana FloridaCEO, The Creative Class Group \u0026 Author, UpgradeWe need to place more value on experiences than on things. At the end of our lives, we treasure our memories more than our things.CommentsSanjay SanghoeeBanker, political and business commentator; author of \u0027Killing Wall Street\u0027 (www.sanghoee.com)The ACA deserves a chance, but more importantly, universal health care deserves a chance. Good health is an inalienable right, even if it does not say so in print.Comments (138)Alon Ben-MeirSenior Fellow, NYU\u0027s Center for Global AffairsThe deal that was struck in Geneva between Iran and the P5 1 represents an important first step in curbing Iran\u0027s nuclear program. Regardless of the multiple flaws it contains, it offers a chance to end Iran\u0027s nuclear impasse peacefully.CommentsAnn BrenoffSenior Writer, The Huffington PostThanksgiving is one of those loaded-for-bear holidays. We overeat, we over-drink, we overwatch football, and speaking anecdotally, we overbook appointments with our therapists for the Monday after. Families, they just do that to you sometimes, you know?Comments (13)Matt WalshBlogger, talk radio host, father of twinsThat\u0027s our entire economic system: buy things. Everybody buy. It doesn\u0027t matter what you buy. Just buy. How appropriate, then, that a holiday created by our ancestors as an occasion to give thanks for what they had, now morphs into a frenzied consumerist ritual where we descend upon shopping malls to accumulate more things we don\u0027t need.Comments (1,258)Conde Nast TravelerCondeNastTraveler.comOf the 981 properties included on UNESCO\u0027s World Heritage List, some 44 are categorized as in-danger, for reasons ranging from political instability to irresponsible tourism.CommentsBelle Beth CooperContent crafter, BufferIf you\u0027re managing social media for your business, it might be useful to know about some of the most surprising social media statistics this year.

White men are Superman, we have learned. Bad men, we have learned, are black. They\u0027re gang bangers and thugs and talk loud and sometimes deliver funny lines where we laugh at their Otherness.Comments (103)Kaela Worthen Gardner, 2013.25.11Marco Cáceres, 2013.25.11David Hassell, 2013.25.11Matthew Ebert, 2013.25.11Steve Mariotti, 2013.25.11Robert D.
