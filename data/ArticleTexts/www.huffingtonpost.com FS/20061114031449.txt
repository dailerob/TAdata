{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"APAPAPAPWhen TIME asked me to take part in a panel this Tuesday to discuss who should be its \"Person of the Year\", my mind immediately turned to Jack Murtha because, contrary to what Karl Rove would like you to believe, this election was all about Iraq. And Murtha was a key reason the midterms became a national referendum on the war.

If it weren\u0027t for Jack Murtha, they\u0027d be voting for Minority Leader.READ POST | comments (124)11.13.2006 Barbara KoppleShut Up and Sing is not only a story about the transformation of these three incredible women and musicians, but also a story of a nation in transformation.READ POST | comments (13)11.13.2006 Flavia ColganElecting Murtha to Majority Leader will win Democrats the only people who ultimately matter - the voters.READ POST | comments (15)11.13.2006 Mark GreenWhether about the war, global warming, the economy or social security, Bush \"has such a high regard for the truth that he uses it sparingly,\" as Lincoln said of a rival.READ POST | comments (19)11.13.2006 Linda SegerHaggard admitted to buying drugs (illegal) and having some sort of sexual relationship with a gay man (legal).
