{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Boehner isn\u0027t worried about a challenge to his leadership; no challenger has emerged. The real issue is neither he nor anyone else is in charge of the GOP. Romney\u0027s loss, along with the erosion of their majority in the House and Democratic gains in the Senate, has left a vacuum at the top. House Republicans don\u0027t run nationally. They run only in their own districts -- which, because of gerrymandering, are growing even more purely Republican. Their major concern is being reelected in 2014, and their biggest potential obstacle in their way is a primary challenge from the right. The combination of a weakened national party and more intense competition in primaries is making the Republican Party relatively impervious to national opinion.Read Post | Comments (981)Marlo Thomas, 12/28/12Award-winning actress, author and activistWe re-elected a president, bought 48 million iPads, dodged a couple hurricanes, obsessed over Tom and Katie\u0027s breakup, and cheered Austrian skydiver Felix Baumgartner, who on October 14 broke the sound barrier in a record-smashing jump from 24 miles up. (He landed fine, btw). What a year it\u0027s been!Read Post | CommentsGreg Gage, 12/28/12Neuroscientist; Co-founder, Backyard Brains; TED FellowIt is clear that some advances in medical technologies fit the definition of a cyborg.

We hope they\u0027ll prompt reflection and provide fresh angles into stories you followed obsessively -- or missed entirely -- in the past year.Read Post | CommentsAmy Ephron, 12/28/12AuthorDiana DeGette\u0027s bill would limit the rounds of ammunition to ten per magazine (if you have two guns that adds up to twenty); forget that we\u0027re not banning any existing weapons at all.

Why are the politicians so paralyzed by the fear of being called weak? Why are peaceful approaches to solving problems at home and abroad not even pursued?Read Post | Comments (119)Bob Burnett, 12/28/12Berkeley writer, retired Silicon Valley executiveWhile Boehner has political status and power, his inept handling of the fiscal cliff negotiation shows he\u0027s not a leader.
