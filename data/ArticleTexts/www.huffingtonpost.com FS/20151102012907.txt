{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, the nation once again survived an onslaught of goblins and ghouls. I\u0027m talking of course about Wednesday\u0027s Republican debate. Candidates, campaigns, and RNC chair Reince Priebus all chided the moderators for not focusing on substance. I assume they are talking about substance like deporting 11 million people, taking health insurance away from 25 million Americans, or pursuing massive tax cuts for the rich. Perhaps they mean Trump\u0027s tax plan, which would cost $10 trillion over 10 years. Or maybe it\u0027s Carson\u0027s \"tithing\" tax plan that would pay for only 28 percent of estimated government spending. If \"substance\" means forcing candidates to account for the real world consequences of their proposals, then perhaps the candidates should be thankful for the absence of substance. Because those consequences would be much scarier than anything any of us saw on our doorsteps last night.When I look back on the great teachers who shaped my life, what I remember isn\u0027t the way they prepared me to take a standardized test.

Women are so far past that that it\u0027s a joke, which is why abortion should not even be in question. Wake up, Dr. Carson.Actress and authorTomorrow, the European Parliament will vote on a proposal that will decide the future of the open Internet in Europe. The proposal is supposed to protect net neutrality, the principle that keeps the Internet an open and free platform, but it contains dangerous loopholes that threaten the future of free speech, innovation and democracy in Europe.Law professor, activist, candidate in the Democratic Primary for PresidentProfessor, Stanford Law School; Director, Stanford Center for Internet and SocietyThe United Nations Climate Change Conference of Parties (COP21) in Paris is only a few weeks away. This global conference is our last chance to tackle catastrophic climate change. If the negotiations fail, there is no plan B -- COP21 is effectively the end of the line.Founder and Chair, Bianca Jagger Human Rights FoundationUnless the White House can guarantee that these troops will be far behind the wire, surrounded by vetted friends, and out of the reach of any enemy operations, there\u0027s a good chance they\u0027ll be in combat, with mortal consequences.Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranWe tell our children to control themselves while slapping and spanking and ejecting them violently in our homes, child care centers, schools, detention facilities and prisons. Adults tell children to be honest while lying and cheating and not to be violent while marketing and glorifying violence.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundProviding basic city services is a responsibility of municipal governments that stands the test of time. But -- just because a service has been provided for a long time in one way, doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s the only way.Chief of Staff, City of BostonThe Party of Putin does not know, or pretend not to know, that Putin is an empire builder surrounded by ideologues whose vision of the world, though complex and robust, is in all key respects opposed to that of the West.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.We want to know why the Federal Reserve, funded and heavily run by the banks, is keeping interest rates so low that we receive virtually no income for our hard-earned savings while the Fed lets the big banks borrow money for virtually no interest.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorWe of course can\u0027t be satisfied just growing OGP and growing the model. We\u0027ve got to keep this organization fluid and vibrant and responsive to what citizens are asking for around the world.U.S. Permanent Representative to the United NationsNow that the NRA is embracing those who are openly fantasizing about shooting and killing Democrats, will some of those high profile supporters begin to distance themselves from the organization and its toxic ideology? Probably not, given the media\u0027s lack of attention to the group\u0027s latest threat.Executive Director, Coalition to Stop Gun ViolencePoliticians lie! I know it, you know it, we all know it!

Actually, you really, really like it.Matchmaker, dating expert, relationship advisorAs the world enters the Third Industrial Revolution, increased connectivity between businesses and prosumers, powered by clean and renewable energies, will change the global economy.

He always had a smile on his face.\" This comment made me angry. Who were they to talk about a man they clearly knew nothing about?Suicide Loss SurvivorIt is virtually impossible to design a format that accommodates this many people -- ten candidates and a whopping six questioners.
