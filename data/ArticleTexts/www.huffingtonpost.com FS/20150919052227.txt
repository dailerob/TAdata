{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Executive Director, ACLU of TexasIslamophobia, and probably racism, certainly played a role in Ahmed\u0027s ordeal, but the fact is overzealous administrators, zero-tolerance policies, and law enforcement officers ill-equipped to deal with schoolchildren have compromised educational environments throughout the country. If we\u0027re handcuffing autistic children at the elbows or throwing them in jail overnight, then we\u0027re failing them. If we\u0027re hitting kids with felony weapons charges for bringing fishing tackle to school, then we\u0027re failing them. And if we\u0027re using suspensions (which absolutely do not work) against students who build clocks, or twirl pencils, or write about pot, or chew their Pop-Tarts into the shape of a gun, then we\u0027re failing them.From the beginning of his tenure as pope, Francis has used his position to change our conversations about what, and who, is important.

Probably the former, but there was a disturbing cast to the second GOP debate, a vituperative jingoism reminiscent of the xenophobia that periodically scars western capitalist societies in moments of disarray.Editor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027They Know Everything About You\u0027His muted volume shrouds pronouncements which, in both their strangeness and self-certainty, are stunning even by Trumpian standards. For little in Dr. Carson\u0027s campaign thus far suggests the slightest awareness of the feeble qualifications, rhetorical excess, and monumental self-regard he brings to his pursuit of the presidency.Author, political commentatorReally? Are we really still defending -- and celebrating! -- the idea that sexual orientation is akin to some deep dark secret to be discussed after dark behind closed doors in hushed tones with only our most trusted confidantes?Editorial Director, The Huffington Post VoicesAm I the only Republican who remembers Ronald Reagan\u0027s 11th Commandment: Thou shalt not speak ill of any fellow Republican? Undoubtedly I\u0027m not, but the people running for the party\u0027s presidential nomination seem to be suffering from collective amnesia as they turn the campaign into a slugfest.Co-founder and former CEO, WWE; 2012 Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in ConnecticutThe U.S. electorate may well be anti-war, in the sense of not wanting U.S. boots on the ground overseas.

Between these positions, Clinton has pitched her tent of \"smart power.\"Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogSomething sneaking up on everyone in the political world is the surprising amount of GOP candidates who are open to ending a massive tax break for hedge fund managers.

Victims of sexual assault who feel that their physician and staff are genuinely concerned and kind are far more likely to return for follow-up visits, seek counseling as well as treatment.Board Certified Family Physician, \"Tha Hip Hop Doc\"Being gay at my HBCU is a bittersweet experience for me. Since birth I was raised with the mentality to be \"The Man.\" I was taught to not pursue anything that \"threatened\" my masculinity. Coming out wasn\u0027t an easy road, but in retrospect I wouldn\u0027t change a thing.Broadcast Journalism Student at Hampton UniversityBy any reasonable standard of what constitutes acceptable public discourse, Donald Trump\u0027s presidential campaign should have ended on Wednesday at about 10:50 p.m. That\u0027s when he set his extravagantly sprayed hair on fire by indulging in some truly dangerous myths about vaccines.Associate professor, School of Journalism, Northeastern University; author, \u0027The Wired City\u0027I\u0027m deeply concerned about America\u0027s young black generation, because if it were not for people who gave me support to be okay with an identity that has nothing to do with looking like or imitating a destructive life, I might mimicked negative stereotypes of violence shown in the media.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundOur goal is to create a rallying cry that moves every American to step up and realize that the responsibility to prevent sexual assault begins with each of us. To end it requires a change in culture that demands everyone\u0027s engagement.Senior Advisor to the President and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsThe Pope was a trusted broker in the behind-the-scenes negotiations that led to an official rapprochement between our two countries, so we\u0027re confident that he\u0027ll speak favorably about warming U.S.-Cuba relations on his trip.Associate, Engage CubaYour zip code, ethnicity and bank balance shouldn\u0027t determine your health. The Kelly Report on Health Disparities in America puts us one step closer to balancing the scales and realizing the core mission of the CBC Health Braintrust: Achieving health equity in a generation.Congressional Black Caucus Health Braintrust Chair, health equity advocate, representative for Illinois\u0027 2nd District.In the Unetaneh Tokef prayer of 2015, we could easily add the phrases: \"who by bullet and who by negligence, who by semi-automatic weapon and who by unlicensed handgun, who by lack of background check and who by accident.\"Rabbi, Temple Sinai, Sharon, MA; Author, Witnesses to the One: the Spiritual History of the Sh\u0027ma (Jewish Lights)Imagine for a moment that the United States faced an existential threat. Variations of this scenario happen in summertime action movies all the time. Sadly this scale is not only seen in movies. Climate change is already an existential threat for many nations.Executive Director of US Climate Action Network (USCAN)Rather than engage in informative, fact-based, positive dialogue about vaccines, Dr. Carson and Dr. Paul did a disservice to science and research.Host of \"Dr. America\" on We Act Radio, pediatrician in Washington DC, member of the National Physicians AllianceIncreasing attacks against ordinary Kurds in the western part of Turkey risks the societal fragmentation of the country, which in turn would encourage political fragmentation and feed into the PKK\u0027s narrative as being the sole protector of the Kurds.Research Director, Al Sharq ForumDo I need the Wheaties box to feel fulfilled? Absolutely not! To simply be here, living my life as my true self is rewarding enough. However, I feel like I owe this box to my friends, family, and fans that have been cheering me on for decades.Four-time Olympic gold medalist, gay man living with HIV, and activistAt the age of 10, I was diagnosed with Alopecia, which is an autoimmune skin condition resulting in hair loss. So when I got the opportunity and platform of being a professional athlete, I launched a program called \"Charlie\u0027s Angels\" with the National Alopecia Areata Foundation.NBA Pro; Queens, NY Native; Latino Dominican Republic; 2005 7th Lottery Pick; 2004 NCAA UConn Champion ; HS All-American; Proud FatherI may never be able to understand the \"purpose\" behind God \"allowing\" this tragedy.

That means finance, and lots of it. The good news is that climate action does not require economic sacrifice.World Bank Group Vice President and Special Envoy for Climate ChangeYou\u0027d think the \"immigration without assimilation is an invasion\" crowd would just love the push for legal permanent residents to become full fledged American citizens, but don\u0027t bet on it. That\u0027s because citizens can vote.Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersRound 2 of the GOP debates was further proof that Jon Stewart was right: No matter how dirty it makes you feel, you just can\u0027t stop watching the Trump Show. And no two commentators can agree on how this roller-coaster ends. But one thing is certain: Mr. Trump cannot lose. Because he\u0027s already won.Instructor of Philosophy, The University of Texas-Pan AmericanThe string of climate disasters unfolding around the world are a brutal reminder that we will never achieve the Sustainable Development Goals if we can\u0027t dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions.Co-founder and Communications Director, 350.orgSometimes I feel like women overcompensate for the fact that they are single mothers by pretending to be a superhero.
