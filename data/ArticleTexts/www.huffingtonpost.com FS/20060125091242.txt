{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"From prawfsblawg.blogs.comWhy is the White House desperately stonewalling requests to release information about Jack Abramoff\u0027s White House comings and goings? I mean, sure, the former uber-lobbyist has become the poster boy for the GOP\u0027s culture of corruption -- but it\u0027s not like he\u0027s been implicated in murder, right? Oh, wait a minute, he has -- the 2001 gangland-style murder of Gus Boulis, a Florida businessman involved in a disputed business deal with Abramoff and two of Abramoff\u0027s buddies from his College Republican days. Abramoff has denied any involvement in the murder, but the more you learn about his connection to the case, the more something smells fishy in Florida.Irony Alert: Tim Russert to Lecture on Ethics (Get Your Tickets Now!)READ POST | comments (64)01.26.2006 Stephen KausOne of the most exasperating things about watching Bush\u0027s press conferences is that he can get off the hook by calling on the next reporter. Bush is never pinned down when he does not respond.READ POST | comments (30)01.26.2006 Karen KwiatkowskiNeoconservatism is a success, at least so far.

The pay is too low, the work too hard, and the indignities too great.READ POST | comments (50)01.25.2006 Jane SmileyI am certain that the Bush administration is planning to endure the impeachment process asap, so that when the Congress votes along party lines, they can say that the \"failure to impeach\" constitutes a \"renewed mandate\". Democrats and progressives, beware!READ POST | comments (30)01.25.2006 Bill DiamondSome analysts interpreted the first-of-its-kind press conference with Barney the White House Dog as a sure sign that the President\u0027s advisors are growing increasingly concerned.READ POST | comments (21)01.26.2006 Harry ShearerBob Novak, at least, is a reporter.
