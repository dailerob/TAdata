{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundAs a nation we seem to be hardened and numb to what should be emotionally disturbing when we cannot legislate the most modest and reasonable measures for national gun safety even after children in as seemingly safe a place as Newtown, Connecticut, far from an inner city, can be shot down in school. We are numb when the same child can be shot one year at his own birthday party and shot again the next year at a Mother’s Day parade and both shootings are just another day on our cities’ streets. Why are we not all calling our legislators and expressing outrage? How can we let the voices of gun dealers and manufacturers drown out the cries of children?Comments (533)JD SchrammLecturer, Stanford Graduate School of BusinessNo conversation, no matter how meaningful and powerful, can bring back the millions we\u0027ve already lost to suicide.

J. Abrams and Bryan BurkWhen we began work on Star Trek Into Darkness, we realized it would be released in May 2013, a moment when our nation would have the opportunity and responsibility to make sure we help these post-9/11 veterans transition back to jobs, higher education, or ongoing careers of service.Comments (65)Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOAllow me please to take you back for a moment to the beginning of 2011. Remember how surprised the world was that, in just 18 days, a leaderless grass-root uprising managed to topple the Mubarak regime that had ruled Egypt with an iron fist for 30 years?Comments (37)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027All these men are honorable. None has broken any law. But they and their ilk in congress -- the Democrats who are now rolling back Dodd-Frank -- don\u0027t seem to appreciate the extent to which Wall Street has harmed, and continues to harm, America.Comments (601)Allison TateAuthor, mother of fourThank you for spending this year with my child, maybe the last year when I can really, truly call him a child, and for continuing to nurture his love of school.

I don\u0027t want to pile on more, but there is an issue connected to both the Syrian civil war and the Israeli/Palestinian conflict that must not be ignored.Comments (47)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistWhen I was a child, the only women you were likely to encounter on the front lines of America\u0027s military didn\u0027t wear uniforms. Instead, they wore high heels, hose and sequins. That\u0027s because these women were not among our soldiers but, instead, part of the U.S.O.Comments (74)Adam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; founder of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911Why should middle-class students pay more for loans than is absolutely necessary, all the while padding the government\u0027s coffers and enabling state universities to build facilities that the students will only get to use for four years?Comments (192)Christopher ElliottAuthor, Scammed: How to Save Your Money and Find Better Service in a World of Schemes, Swindles and Shady DealsThe future of travel will be filled with steals and deals for a lucky few, but for the rest of us?

But her wide smile never wavered.Comments (18)Dixie LouviereAnimal rescue volunteerWhen you\u0027ve lost everything -- your neighborhood, your home, or someone you care about -- getting even the smallest piece of your life back can mean everything to you.
