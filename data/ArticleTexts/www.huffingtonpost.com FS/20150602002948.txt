But the flow of federal money poses a bit of awkwardness for the Lone Star State. After all, just over a month ago hundreds of Texans decided that a pending Navy Seal/Green Beret joint training exercise was really an excuse to take over the state and impose martial law.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027I started out like anyone else, skeptical but intrigued.
