{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundOne year later, what has been done? Despite personal visits from Newtown families to Congress to ask for action, Congress has done very little at all. In April, the Senate shamefully put political calculations over the will of the American people and voted down a package of common-sense gun violence prevention provisions designed to prevent future tragedies and the everyday gun violence that saturates the lives of children in America. It is unbelievable one year and thousands of gun deaths later that it has been so hard to achieve major progress at the national level and in many states in protecting children instead of guns. We must never tire of the really hard work demanded to transform the pervasive culture of violence and pervasive presence of guns in America.Comments (38)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, Beyond OutrageIt\u0027s charity time, and not just because the holiday season reminds us to be charitable. As the tax year draws to a close, the charitable tax deduction beckons. If Congress ever gets around to revising the tax code, it might consider limiting the charitable deduction to real charities.CommentsDiane ScottExecutive Vice President, Chief Product and Marketing Officer, Western UnionTexts, email, social media--in a society that feels over-connected, this time of year many of us crave more meaningful connections. Prior to joining Western Union, checking in with distant loved ones was prompted by the aroma of a Thanksgiving turkey or a birthday reminder on my calendar. Today, helping people connect is the core of what I do, and I get to learn this skill from some of the very best.CommentsJennifer MeerMother and writer at my-jenneration.blogspot.comDecember has always been a miraculous time. It marks the season in my life when I labored with both my children on the same date, in different years: December 14. But I cannot help but think of a community not so very far from my own. December 14 marks a very different day for them.CommentsDr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarThe great thing about celebrity narcissism is that we hold the clicker. When we\u0027ve had enough, we can simply move on to another distraction. In our lives, the closer the narcissist is, the hard it is to escape the vortex.CommentsChristopher MurrayPsychotherapistThe last time I saw Ben Wheeler, he and his big brother Nate were eating chocolate-chip pancakes and being terribly silly. Nine months after the pancake breakfast, I got a strange voicemail: There had been another school shooting, this time in Connecticut.CommentsAlissa ParkerBlogger, TheParkerFive and co-founder, safeandsoundschools.orgIt has been one year since I saw my sweet little Emilie. I will be honest, I hate when the media comes into town. I don\u0027t like seeing their vans with large satellite dishes parked on every corner. I don\u0027t like seeing my daughter\u0027s picture on the news associated with her violent death.Comments (85)Jessica Ann MitchellWriter for OurLegaci.com and founder of Black Bloggers ConnectThis defense obviously doesn\u0027t work for black and poor youth. Yet, news outlets are spiraling about 16-year-old Ethan Couch who caused the deaths of four people by drunk driving. His defense was that he suffered from \"Affluenza\" -- a disorder that only the affluent have.Comments (33)Sen. Richard BlumenthalU.S. Senator from ConnecticutNewtown changed all of us forever, and now our obligation is to change the world for the better. And that means keeping faith with the families, and all Americans, in seeking to prevent such horrors from happening.CommentsRep. Alan GraysonU.S. Congressman for Florida\u0027s 9th DistrictSo we cannot properly attribute the catastrophe in Greece to labor protection, nor can we attribute it to government borrowing. What is the cause, then?Comments (19)TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"What if you could spend your summers swimming with dolphins in turquoise seas? Behavioral biologist Denise Herzing does just that. In this beautiful video, meet some of the dolphins she\u0027s befriended along the way.Comments (41)Jeff Pope and Steve CooganGolden Globe Nominated screenplay writersMuch as we\u0027d like to let our film, Philomena, speak for itself, Kyle Smith\u0027s heavy handed attack upon the lady whose story we told compels us to reply.CommentsJon HotchkissCreator, ThisvsThatShow.comThis story of corporate greed will make you so angry that you\u0027ll demand justice be done. The show Mythbusters is doing the exact same experiments and using the same exact words as MY new science series, This vs That and their producers and Discovery Channel won\u0027t pay me.Comments (17)Sanjay SanghoeeBanker, political and business commentator; author of \u0027Killing Wall Street\u0027 (www.sanghoee.com)The families of Newtown victims have done a lot to push for gun control and their work will surely continue to make a difference both in terms of public awareness and also legislation, but the burden of restoring sanity to a nation gone gun crazy should not fall to them alone.Comments (28)Raquel D\u0027ApiceStand-up comic and writer of \u0027The Ugly Volvo\u0027 blogI am a 10-month-old baby and I write because my mother has been sending out my \"Christmas List\" to people, and her list does not in any way represent the things I really want. I could give two s#*ts about receiving stacking cups.Comments (19)David RockDirector, NeuroLeadership InstituteResearch is beginning to have us question where we put our attention as a society, questioning what we should care about. If we want to avoid any kind of derailing, perhaps it\u0027s time we all paid more attention to sleep.CommentsMarion WinikAuthor, Humorist, ProfessorVamping down the runway in their clodhopper high heels, those reckless, ironic drag queens appeared as beacons to me, fur-coat aunties from somewhere in my spiritual family tree. What a little pioneer of gender dysphoria I was.CommentsRichard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureWhen did older people become the enemy? Last week a judge ruled that Detroit could move forward with its plan to cut pensions for retired city workers. This week Washington is celebrating a budget deal which harms older people economically in several ways.Comments (315)Ken ToltzBusinessman, political activist and Founder of Safe Campus ColoradoIn their enthusiasm for the promotion of more guns wielded by more people in more places, they have trampled American\u0027s rights as enumerated by the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights, freedom of speech, peaceful assembly and petitioning our government for changes in the laws.Comments (206)Bill MoyersManaging Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyWhy are record numbers of Americans on food stamps? Because record numbers of Americans are in poverty. Why are people falling through the cracks? Because there are cracks to fall through.Comments (323)Laura W. MurphyDirector, ACLU Washington Legislative OfficeInnocent Americans should never have to worry their government\u0027s awesome surveillance capabilities are intercepting, filtering, collecting, analyzing, and storing the intimate details of their lives. Appallingly, they do.Comments (22)Rabbi Yehoshua SoudakoffDirector, Jewish Deaf MultimediaAs a Deaf person myself, I was taken aback at the fact that at one of the most significant world events in recent times, a phony interpreter was chosen to represent the Deaf community. It serves as a message to the Deaf community that the world still does not understand us.CommentsCon SlobodchikoffAuthorIf we abandon the old paradigm that we are intrinsically different and superior to all other life forms, it\u0027s possible to look at animals with greater respect and, like Denise Herzing, start working towards decoding their language.CommentsJonathon OwenCopy editor and language writerMy last post, \"12 Mistakes Nearly Everyone Who Writes about Grammar Mistakes Makes,\" drew a lot of comments, some supportive and some critical. But no point drew as much ire as my claim that irregardless is a word.Comments (137)Josh SugarmannExecutive director, Violence Policy CenterMuch will be said in the coming days about how successful advocates have been in achieving their goals since 12/14. And make no mistake: Given the opposition we face, we cannot expect to win overnight.Comments (206)Abby HeugelAward-winning humor writer, blogger and editorCan you believe it\u0027s already the holiday season again? This year\u0027s perfectly delightful note is being sent on paper I made myself (check out my store on Etsy!) to tell you what we have been up to.CommentsDennis J. KucinichFmr. 16-year Member of US Congress; Two-time US Presidential CandidateIn a country where the average monthly minimum wage stands at about $150 USD, it\u0027s not hard to understand why Ukrainians are in the streets. But is their plight being exploited to usher in a new military agreement under the guise of economic reform?Comments (40)Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde and Bishop Ian T. DouglasIt is long past time to pass legislation that will expand background checks and other modest measures that will save lives and assuage even a small portion of the grief caused by gun violence that has become a staple of our pastoral duties and our prayers.Comments (55)Jonathan KimGentleman farmer, film critic for ReThink Reviews and the Uprising ShowIt\u0027s hard to believe that David O. Russell\u0027s first feature film was an incest comedy called Spanking the Monkey. Now, with his track record of critically-acclaimed dramedies, he has his pick of Hollywood\u0027s A-list talent, some of whom reached that level because of him.CommentsJim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027Congress ends its December session today, and we will break down the tent.

It\u0027s time to take our movement deeper, take this nation deeper, and take our political debate to a much deeper level.Comments (19)Michael J. TanseyChicago psychologist, author, teacherThe American public must remember, not only the horror of the massacre a year ago, but the no-votes from corrupt senators who flagrantly betrayed their constituents.Comments (21)Ashley B. CarsonPolicy \u0026 Advocacy Director, Compassion \u0026 ChoicesThe answer is simple: \"physician-assisted suicide\" is a grossly inaccurate way to describe the medical practice of aid in dying, both from a medical and legal perspective.Comments (21)Danny Groner, 2013.14.12Robert Reich, 2013.14.12William Bradley, 2013.14.12Blake Fleetwood, 2013.14.12Seth Abramson, 2013.14.12David Finkle, 2013.14.12Sen.
