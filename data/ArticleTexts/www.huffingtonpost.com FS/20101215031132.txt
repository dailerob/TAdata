From logo to language to logistics, it all must be of a piece. Consistency matters. A concise identity counts. Which got me thinking about the Democrats. As the lame duck tax debate slogs towards its inevitable conclusion, I\u0027m wondering: what does the brand \"Democrat\" mean?

Secretary of Labor; Professor at Berkeley; Author, Aftershock: \u0027The Next Economy and America\u0027s Future\u0027Wall Street is back. Bonuses on the Street are expected to rise about 5 percent this year. But nothing is trickling down. Job growth is still anemic and the median wage is barely rising, adjusted for inflation.Read Post | CommentsScott Mendelson, 12.14.2010Film Critic and Pundit for Salon, Huffington Post, and Mendelson\u0027s MemosMost bad movies make me a little sad. Tron: Legacy made me angry. Its sheer laziness on every level feels like a cynical experiment, a way to test if audiences will bite at anything that has enough special effects and dollars thrown at it.Read Post | CommentsStephen Kinzer, 12.14.2010Award-winning foreign correspondentHolbrooke was among the country\u0027s most extraordinary modern diplomats. Would that he had searched his soul more deeply at the end, so that we might have learned more from him.Read Post | CommentsCarl Pope, 12.14.2010Chairman, Sierra ClubIt\u0027s hard to avoid the conclusion that while the world is far from ready to do what it must with the substance of the climate threat, it is also true that the process has become the enemy, rather than the facilitator, of progress.Read Post | CommentsStephan Salisbury, 12.14.2010Author, Mohamed’s Ghosts: An American Story of Love and Fear in the HomelandWhat should be increasingly clear is that Republican members of the incoming Congress are looking for terrorism in ever more startling places. It seems that, for them, all domestic issues are potentially terrorist issues.Read Post | CommentsClarence B. Jones, 12.14.2010Scholar in Residence, Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute at Stanford UniversityObama\u0027s compromise on the current tax deal must be evaluated against several other previously important issues connected to the exercise or lack of exercise of his presidential leadership.Read Post | CommentsCraig Aaron, 12.14.2010Managing Director, Free PressThe Mr. Smith in question is Gordon Smith, who is persuading his former colleagues to use a rolling series of secret holds to keep a bill off the floor that would create thousands of new hyper-local community radio stations.Read Post | CommentsMike Lux, 12.14.2010Author, The Progressive Revolution: How the Best in America Came to BeThe headline battles about the tax cut deal and the deficit commission are very big deals. But what is going on behind the curtain in the fight over banking policy and foreclosure fraud is just as important, and in some ways even more so.Read Post | CommentsWilliam C. Chittick, Ph.D., 12.14.2010Professor of Religious Studies, State University of New York, Stony BrookOne of the biggest misunderstandings shown by Christian theologians is the notion that Islam has little or nothing to say about love.Read Post | CommentsRichard (RJ) Eskow, 12.14.2010Consultant, Writer, Senior Fellow with The Campaign for America\u0027s FutureSomebody in a position of power should read the emails I get from foreclosed homeowners. Despite widespread bank criminality and despite the fact that help for struggling homeowners would help get the economy moving, we\u0027re not seeing the leadership we need.Read Post | CommentsMichael Moore, 12.14.2010Oscar and Emmy-winning directorFor those of you who think it\u0027s wrong to support Julian Assange because of the sexual assault allegations he\u0027s being held for, all I ask is that you not be naive about how the government works when it decides to go after its prey.Read Post | CommentsJay Neugeboren, 12.14.2010AuthorFor my eighty-seventh birthday, my son Marvin, a retired New York City high school English teacher, sent me a gift certificate for a weekend conference here in Miami on how to pick up women.Read Post | CommentsRobert Creamer, 12.14.2010Political organizer, strategist and authorNext year the Republicans will have ironclad control of the House. It would be outrageous if Democrats allowed a minority of Republican Senators to use the current rules to limit what the Democratic majority can do in the Senate.Read Post | CommentsDaphne Eviatar, 12.14.2010Senior Associate in Human Rights First’s Law and Security ProgramIt would almost be funny that lawmakers give more credit to the likes of Rush Limbaugh, Liz Cheney alarmist Fox News anchors than to their own retired senior military leaders -- but only if the consequences weren\u0027t so serious.Read Post | CommentsCraig Barnes, 12.14.2010Trial lawyer and public radio commentatorThe president has met with Republicans and put together a tax deal that was, he said, the best he could get from them. Despite the outraged cries of liberal democrats, this may actually be a very good thing.Read Post | CommentsMary Steenburgen, 12.14.2010ActressIf you\u0027re still scrambling to finish your holiday shopping, allow me to make an unlikely suggestion: A camel.
