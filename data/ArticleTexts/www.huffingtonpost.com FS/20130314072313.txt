{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"David CoatesWorrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsLet the president be charming, by all means. But let him also stand his ground. Better he does that, and works assiduously to win back the House for Democrats in 2014, than he strikes a grand bargain that cuts Social Security for the old and Medicaid for the poor. The \"not so grand bargain\" struck in December to avoid going over the fiscal cliff has already taxed the poor and the middle class enough. It is time for the rich and the corporate to bear their share, and time for the Democrats to remind the Republicans that it was Barack Obama\u0027s notion of change, not Mitt Romney\u0027s, that won in November.Comments (99)Michael MooreOscar and Emmy-winning directorSomeday a Sandy Hook mother - or a Columbine mother, or an Aurora mother, or a mother from massacres yet to come - will say, like the mother of Emmett Till, \"I just want the world to see.\" And then nothing about guns in this country will ever be the same again.Comments (1,533)Jonathan JacksonWriter, synesthete, startup founderWe inherit this system, this process, and, if we don\u0027t question it, we perpetuate it. It\u0027s quiet. It\u0027s subtle. And it holds small power asymmetries in place. In that sense, last names have the potential to stand for something much, much bigger.Comments (357)Arianna HuffingtonIt\u0027s become accepted wisdom that Washington has become pathologically polarized and partisan, with every new debate inevitably breaking down along party lines. That\u0027s why it was so remarkable last week when Rand Paul\u0027s old-fashioned talking filibuster scrambled the even more old-fashioned right-vs.-left way of looking at the world.Comments (400)Norman LearFounder, People for the American WayIf anybody can tell me that there are another two syllables that can express what lies just beneath the consciousness of most Americans at this minute -- and all Americans when they know what they are angry minute about, I want to know what that is.CommentsShawn AhmedCreator of The Uncultured ProjectToday was probably the first -- and last -- time someone who is both Muslim and gay will be the one to bring Catholic priests news of a new Pope.CommentsFrank Niles, Ph.D.Behavioral scientist, adventure athlete, executive coach and speakerWhen we choose to say yes to what we are given by living in the present, making meaning of each day, our experiences go from dread and \"I can\u0027t wait until today is over\" to appreciation and purpose.Comments (26)Jeff DanzigerPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideComments (45)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorWalmart CEO Mike Duke makes approximately $11,000 an hour. Think about that -- $11,000 every hour. Think about an hour of your day, the tasks you accomplish, and the compensation you receive from your employer.Comments (238)Mike RyanSenior Entertainment Writer, The Huffington PostSpring Breakers, one of the oddest things (not just movies, \"things\") that you will ever see with your own eyes, opens in limited release this weekend.Comments (134)Rev. Gary R. Hall and Rabbi David SapersteinThis weekend, not only will the Sabbath be different from other days of the week, it will also be different than other Sabbaths during the year. Congregations across the country will participate in a gun violence prevention Sabbath.Comments (245)Sen. Claire McCaskillU.S. Senator from MissouriWhile the military justice system is different from our civil justice system for good reasons, the time has come to take a hard look at the rules which allow military commanders to vacate entire jury convictions, expunge criminal records, and reinstate convicted sex offenders.Comments (11)Carol J. CarterAuthor and student success expertAre we overemphasizing analytical and academic skills at the expense of the \"soft\" skills and experiences that students actually need to get to know themselves, understand what they are good at, be able to overcome challenges, think critically and creatively, and determine what makes them unique in the world?CommentsSen. Robert MenendezU.S. Senator, New JerseyToo many in the region still question our intentions and staying power. They do not want the United States to stay as an occupier; nor do they want us to abandon them. Afghans today fear U.S. abandonment more than they fear the Taliban.Comments (27)Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoThe military\u0027s argument that Bradley Manning violated the aiding the enemy statute is clearly ill-founded.CommentsMitchell WeissChief of Staff, Boston Mayor Thomas M. MeninoThe next wave of successful public-private partnerships won\u0027t be top down, process-driven and systems-heavy. Businesses that learn to help government cultivate and harness its own strength -- in community -- will serve our democracy best.CommentsArianna HuffingtonAt HuffPost, we\u0027re committed to putting the spotlight on organizations leading us into a more compassionate future. Like Chime for Change, which brings together a range of voices, from women\u0027s advocates and experts to business leaders and philanthropists, to seize a moment in which girls\u0027 and women\u0027s issues are in many ways front and center.Comments (31)Elliott NeginDirector of News \u0026 Commentary, Union of Concerned ScientistsPBS\u0027s Charlie Rose failed to grill ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson on his company\u0027s role in blocking efforts to address global warming, so Huffington Post contributor Elliott Negin intervened.Comments (18)Scott LillySenior fellow, Center for American ProgressIt would be possible to cut the Federal Aviation Administration budget in a far less disruptive way than the sequestration plan outlined by the agency\u0027s administrator. Was it about grandstanding and budget hype?CommentsLorraine Devon WilkeWriter of Sass \u0026 SensibilityContemporary culture needs to step up to the new norm and recognize that many of our best and brightest are not just the youngsters coming up, but the journeymen still so vitally and vibrantly holding the top.CommentsMelinda GatesCo-chair, the Bill and Melinda Gates FoundationWe all want to bring every good thing to our children. My daughter and her friends want to have the power to choose a rewarding future for themselves. Girls in countries like Niger want the same thing.Comments (13)Cynthia GallagherVice President and Deputy Controller at AOLGuilt will slow you down, it will present itself as a roadblock to success and it will have you second -guessing every decision you make. Sheryl Sandberg\u0027s latest book and online venture Lean In has sparked another level of conversation around the concept of guilt.CommentsLee WoodruffCo-author, \u0027In an Instant\u0027, Author, \u0027Perfectly Imperfect\u0027The first time I met acclaimed artisan Barney Bellinger, he was walking in my sister\u0027s house with a school kid\u0027s grin and a big basket of mushrooms.CommentsVivian Diller, Ph.D.Psychologist and author, \u0027Face It\u0027Turning 60 myself, I\u0027m not unfamiliar with my generation\u0027s worries, nor guilt free when it comes to whining about them. But does all the complaining actually help?CommentsWill MuirFounder and CEO of Equal Community Foundation and Danazoom.comSadly, most solutions for empowering and protecting women do not engage men as part of the solution. But there are ideas to change that.Comments (25)Dr. Jordan ShlainPhysician, innovator, purveyor of good medicineIf you haven\u0027t been paying close attention, \"patient engagement\" is a white-hot topic in health care these days. It wasn\u0027t sexy five years ago.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorAs the Ryan budget, which is really quite divorced from reality outside the hyper-conservative House and has absolutely zero chance of enactment, shows, these budgets have little to do with the actual agreements that determine actual revenues, outlays, and policies.Comments (212)Lisa ArendsAuthor, wellness coach, and math teacherWhen people learn that my husband of ten years abandoned me with a text message, avoided any communication, committed marital fraud and carried out felony bigamy, the first reaction I get is often surprise and disbelief. The second? Blame.Comments (150)Joy PecknoldFashion and travel writer, Passport blog editor for Kiwi CollectionYou\u0027ve clocked two months of solid work since Christmas break and it\u0027s time for another escape.CommentsTim GunnCo-host and mentor, Lifetime’s \u0027Project Runway\u0027By branding domestic violence and sexual assault, we aim to engage the general public to understand that, like other health issues -- cancer, heart disease -- domestic violence and sexual assault need to be more of a priority.CommentsDaniel EllsbergFormer American military analyst who sparked a national uproar in 1971.Today, the Freedom of the Press Foundation has published an audio recording of Bradley Manning\u0027s speech to a military court from two weeks ago, in which he gives his reasons and motivations behind leaking over 700,000 government documents to WikiLeaks.Comments (940)Norman Lear, 2013.13.03Molly Hahn, 2013.13.03Spectra, 2013.13.03Impatient Optimists, 2013.13.03Madeleine M.
