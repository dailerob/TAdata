{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Since no one will win in the latest Middle East clash and everyone will lose, it might be assumed that sanity will prevail, and the current clashes will stop short of full-scale war. But given the record of the participants, that might be hoping for too much. With the Israelis threatening yet another \"final\" showdown; some Palestinian groups threatening \"big surprises\" yet to come; and the U.S. Congress giving its unconditional support to Israel, undercutting the administration\u0027s more cautious support of the right of self-defense while urging restraint on all sides -- it appears we may be \"off to the races\" -- with no lessons learned and new realities ignored. God save us from our folly.Read Post | Comments (253)Beau Lotto, 11/16/12Director, LottoLabA blue sky is a contradiction: the sky at night is devoid of colour, so why during the day does the world seem to be shrouded in a blanket of blue?Read Post | Comments (339)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 11/17/12Author, research psychologist and gender scholarIf science is telling us that drinking while pregnant is okay, why do we continue to judge the woman with the outstretched belly sipping from a glass of Merlot? Turns out, it\u0027s not only right wing Republicans questioning a woman\u0027s control over her own body, is it?Read Post | Comments (270)Tom Cornwall, 11/16/12Human behaviour expert, former advisor to the National Well-Being ProgrammeWe all like to think that we are right. And we will often go to great lengths to persuade others that our view is the right view. But what Beau Lotto reveals in his powerful TEDTalk is that our reality is merely a perception and, \"the light that falls on your eye is meaningless.\"Read Post | Comments (12)Arianna Huffington, 11/16/12In this double issue of Huffington magazine, I\u0027m delighted to present our first-ever Huffington gift guide. Our editors have drawn up a list of their favorite gift ideas for everyone: from travelers, sports fans and gadget lovers to environmentalists, culture buffs and kids. But our guide is more than just a list of stuff to buy; it\u0027s about \"seeing the holiday season as a time of reinvention.\"Read Post | Comments (15)David Paul, 11/17/12President, Fiscal Strategies GroupThis should not be so hard. The fiscal cliff is nothing more than one more set of self-imposed deadlines that Congress put in place so that they could comply with their own rules. We have seen this before.Read Post | Comments (17)Robert Reich, 11/16/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Can we please get a grip? The only sentient beings in a corporation are the people who run them or work for them. When it comes to criminality, they\u0027re the ones who should be punished.Read Post | Comments (339)Raymond J. Learsy, 11/17/12Author, \u0027Oil and Finance: The Epic Corruption Continues\u0027The Obama administration now has an opportunity to reposition the Energy Department as a force for national energy independence, an economic force for national security, and as a monitor and sponsor of rational energy pricing thereby husbanding a mighty engine of economic growth.Read Post | Comments (31)Jason Silva, 11/17/12Filmmaker, FuturistWe can never really know anything outside of its context, even things we are looking at with our eyes. After gasping at how easily our eyes can be fooled, I found myself thinking of the role of context in many other situations.Read Post | CommentsTammy Nelson, Ph.D., 11/17/12Sex and relationship expert; Psychotherapist; Author; International speakerIf monogamy fails more than half of the time, are we looking at a system that no longer serves our needs? Are we holding onto a romanticized notion of love and desire, hoping that we can get it right, but continuing to fail at it over and over again?Read Post | Comments (147)Ben Thomas, 11/16/12Founder, The ConnectomeWe\u0027re hallucinating reality all the time -- but we only take notice when our hallucinations fail to make accurate predictions; when we think we\u0027re certain of something that\u0027s actually not so certain, and our brains have to hunt down new information in order to make better predictions.Read Post | Comments (97)Rocky Kistner, 11/16/12Media associate, NRDCThe largest oil spill in America\u0027s history should have been a wake-up call. If we refuse to learn from that mistake, it will become a recurring nightmare instead.Read Post | CommentsRichard Greene, 11/16/12Communication Strategist, Author of \"Words That Shook The World\"We are in danger of going over \"The Fiscal Cliff\" -- in large part -- because of the framing of the Bush tax Cut issue and adding \"revenue\" to our debt crisis has been appalling. Why is no one breaking this down? And why are we ignoring two hugely relevant points?Read Post | Comments (107)Ralph Nader, 11/16/12Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorAs America faces the so-called \"fiscal cliff,\" let\u0027s turn our attention to our country\u0027s systemic tax problem. To paint a picture, imagine our country as a mine car with its brake lines severed, barreling toward an uncertain fate.Read Post | Comments (276)Chris Weigant, 11/16/12Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comEvery member of Congress began this year knowing what was going to happen at the end of 2012. They have now had over ten months to work on the impending crisis. And what have they done about it? Nothing.Read Post | Comments (28)Doug Ibendahl, 11/16/12Chicago attorney and former General Counsel of the Illinois Republican PartyIf a guy can\u0027t even get the simple stuff within a shrinking party organization of which he is a part, why would we possibly trust him with the government of an entire state -- especially one as large and important as Illinois?Read Post | CommentsEmil Her Many Horses, 11/17/12Associate Curator, National Museum of the American IndianMuch of traditional Lakota culture was threatened in the early 1900s. After the Lakota people were placed on reservations in the late 1800s, the U.S. government forbade their language and ceremonial life.Read Post | Comments (34)Mary Orlin, 11/16/12The WineFashionistaI kind of cringe at the lists that endorse wines other than American wines for Thanksgiving. It\u0027s not like there\u0027s not enough US made wines that fit the bill.
