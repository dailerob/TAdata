{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"APFrom news.aol.comAPFrom elporvenir.comTo hear the Bush administration spin it, the surge in violence in Iraq is a crafty attempt to affect the \u002706 Elections. According to the senior spokesman for the U.S. military in Iraq, it is \"no coincidence\" that the increase in killings is taking place in \"the run up to the American midterm elections.\" President Bush had a similar take: \"There\u0027s certainly a stepped-up level of violence, and we\u0027re heading into an election.\" There you have it: Sunnis and Shiites are not killing each other over centuries-old religious conflicts; they\u0027re killing each other because they disagree about who should be Speaker of the House, Denny Hastert or Nancy Pelosi. Who needs bumper stickers, lawn signs, or volunteer phone banks when you\u0027ve got IEDs?
