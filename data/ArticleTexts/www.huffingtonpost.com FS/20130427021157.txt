{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jason LinkinsEditor, Eat the PressWay back in August of 2011, Congress passed a law called the Budget Control Act, which raised the debt ceiling, enacted a tranche of spending cuts, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, and then imposed on that committee a set of conditions that would trigger this thing known as \"the sequestration\" -- a series of deep cuts to military and domestic programs -- should that committee fail to come to an agreement on further deficit-slaying cuts and revenue-raisers. Somebody decided that the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction should be called the \"Super Committee,\" predicting \"super\" things to come. Those \"super\" things never materialized. The Super Committee failed, and the sequestration went into effect. But apparently, lawmakers are only now figuring out that the law they passed that included the triggering of massive cuts to a wide variety of government services actually, you know, does some stuff.Comments (2,141)Mick EbelingFounder, Not Impossible FoundationThe EyeWriter has been a journey, and due to the nature of ALS it\u0027s a never-ending one.

In addition to stigma, there are still far too many misconceptions when we think and talk about HIV.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorReinhart and Rogoff and their paper are part of the problem and if they want to do the world a favor they should try to become part of the solution. Unfortunately, that\u0027s not the tack they take in this morning\u0027s New York Times.Comments (57)Eric BoehlertSenior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaFox\u0027s ugly religious attacks represent a brazen display of bigotry and bullying. The hypocrisy is that Fox News routinely downplays acts of political, and religious, violence from far-right extremists, while making sure not to condemn those indirectly associated with them.Comments (109)Hunter BidenChairman of the Board, World Food Program USALive Below the Line is a national campaign to help alleviate extreme poverty by challenging Americans to eat and drink for less than the global poverty line -- $1.50 a day -- as 1.4 billion people on our planet must do every day.CommentsMarian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundHow many millions of children who were hurt or neglected themselves grow up hopeless, hate-filled, and continue the cycle of hurting others?

Abuse is inherent in the making of the factory farm, and it\u0027s the publics\u0027 right to see it, and decide if they can stomach the level at which it\u0027s happening.CommentsLauren A.

Several popular fashion trends from last year are likely to make a comeback this weekend.CommentsTomas OlesenDJ, producer, online editor and freelance writerThat Tempt\u0027s tag is so clean, that his style is so apparent it looks like he drew it with his hand, is incredible.

(ret)., Author, American Legal ScholarLibrary? Are there books in this \"library\"? Human shortcomings being what they are, most modern presidents have needed to blue pencil a paragraph or two for the historical record.Comments (12)Seth ShostakSenior Astronomer, SETI InstituteIt seems that the frequency of planets able to support life is roughly one percent. In other words, a billion or more such worlds exist in our galaxy alone. That\u0027s a lot of acreage, and it takes industrial-strength credulity to believe it\u0027s all bleakly barren.Comments (27)Bob BurnettBerkeley writer, retired Silicon Valley executiveFor 58 million Americans, the Social Security system works satisfactorily. Therefore, many were surprised when President Obama suggested a fix, using the chained CPI for the cost-of-living adjustment.
