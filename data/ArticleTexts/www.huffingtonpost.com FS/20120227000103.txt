{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Oscar Sunday is traditionally the one day of the year when Hollywood turns its back on sequels. This week\u0027s headlines, on the other hand, were rife with stories we\u0027d seen before. In Afghanistan, 13 people, including two American soldiers, were killed in the aftermath of the burning of Korans at a U.S. military base (is unhinged Florida pastor Terry Jones preparing to demand royalties?). At the White House, President Obama again broke out in song, this time riffing on \"Sweet Home Chicago\" (as usual, the sequel didn\u0027t live up to the original: His \"Let\u0027s Stay Together\" was much cooler). Meanwhile, in Arizona, the GOP gave us the latest installment in the longest running horror series since Friday the 13th (this time out, Romney returned from the dead yet again after goading Rick Santorum into making a spirited defense of Senate process and earmarks).

It is the most divine pleasure to exact the revenge of the brutalized child that resides within.Read Post | Comments (308)Arianna Huffington, 02/21/12With unemployment still over 8 percent, we currently have more ingenuity, energy, and expertise than we have jobs -- and definitely more time on our hands. That\u0027s one reason I was so drawn to Abundance, a new book by Peter Diamandis and Steven Kotler.Read Post | Comments (133)Richard Branson, 02/24/12Founder, Virgin GroupI have seen many lives ruined by drug abuse.

Over the last thirty years, we have witnessed a massive consolidation of our food system, leading to the loss of millions of family farmers, the destruction of soil fertility, the pollution of our water, and health epidemics.Read Post | Comments (522)Ellen DeGeneres, 02/24/12Animatrice, \u0027The Ellen DeGeneres Show\u0027I can\u0027t wait to see Billy Crystal host the Oscars. I think he\u0027s gonna do a fantastic job. If I could tell him anything, it would be to enjoy every second, and if he finds a maroon blazer with elbow patches, I think I left it backstage. I\u0027ll be watching on Sunday!Read Post | Comments (20)Stephen M. Sweeney, 02/25/12New Jersey Senate PresidentGovernor Christie\u0027s veto only delayed the day and time when we finally establish marriage equality in the Garden State -- because it is going to happen in New Jersey, and we are going to override his veto.Read Post | Comments (1,908)Bill McKibben, 02/24/12Author of a dozen books, including \u0027The End of Nature\u0027 and \u0027Deep Economy\u0027We don\u0027t have enough fingers to plug every hole in the dike; we need to change the basic underlying economics, by charging the fossil fuel industry for the damage carbon does in the atmosphere instead of just letting them continue to use the atmosphere as an open sewer for free.Read Post | Comments (247)Eva Longoria, 02/23/12Actress, Founder of the Eva Longoria FoundationThroughout our country, Latinos live in and contribute to an increasingly diverse America.

It fills you with a strange sense of purpose that seems to invigorate the project and deepen the vision, even when you feel like all you\u0027ve got is fireflies to follow.Read Post | Comments (85)Marlo Thomas, 02/20/12Award-winning actress, author, and activistFor many of us, Presidents Day means an extra day off work and the chance to hit up the holiday sales. But, as we recall from our school days, it\u0027s actually more than that.Read Post | Comments (136)Bernard-Henri Lévy, 02/21/12French philosopher and writerAngelina Jolie goes behind the camera -- and what happens? She shoots a film d\u0027auteur, with unknown Bosnian actors and the film is set in this blind spot of 20th century history, in this moment of utter sorrow, indignity and shame for the nations that let it happen: the Bosnian war.Read Post | Comments (37)Paul Brandeis Raushenbush, 02/18/12Senior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostMr. Santorum should be careful in his efforts to score political points using biblical mandates on the same week that he shows such callousness towards the lives of the poor.Read Post | Comments (2,200)Jessica Alba, 02/25/12Actress, activist, CEO \u0026 President, The Honest CompanyAs a new parent, I desperately needed a place where I could get all my daily essentials -- from diapers to cleaning products -- and I could trust that they would be safe, eco-friendly, affordable, and effective.

Daughters, Fathers, And The Changing American Family\u0027With mounting signs that the economy is getting some traction, boiling populist rage is dialing down to a grumbling simmer.

It is but a TV show with a few awards carved up and spread around... And if I\u0027m not very much mistaken did I detect the faint whiff of a few wrong \u0027uns miming? I think I did... You know who you are and you should be ashamed of yourselves.Read Post | CommentsMarcus Samuelsson, 02/22/12Chef and authorHarlem is alive and thriving, more so now than ever before, and in many cases food is at the center of Harlem\u0027s new economic growth.
