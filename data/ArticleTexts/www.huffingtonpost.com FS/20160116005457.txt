{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressSenior Political Economy ReporterAfter a promising start, Clinton\u0027s campaign has taken an abrupt, confused, strategic turn. Recent polling suggests her rival for the Democratic nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders, is not only ahead of Clinton in New Hampshire, but is neck-and-neck, perhaps even ahead, in Iowa. That these early states are shaping up as competitive shouldn’t be a shock to anyone. Voters break late -- many aren\u0027t paying close attention until a few weeks before their state\u0027s contest. And yet, Clinton has responded to the adversity by doing, frankly, what Clintons always tend to do -- going on the attack. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, as long as those attacks make sense in the context of a Democratic primary. What Clinton has come up with, however, is strategic madness.For one Bill Cosby, there are hundreds like him who will never be indicted. I think this way because I know it from experience. I have my own Bill Cosby tale to tell.Ernst Freund Distinguished Service Professor of Law and Ethics, The University of ChicagoWhat\u0027s been less noted is how the religious relight, another force behind Cruz, would have responded if it knew at the time that Cruz was taking a loan from a company that had helped make marriage equality a reality.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostWhen Obama took part in the recent CNN town hall on gun violence, he noted, \"There\u0027s nothing else in our lives that we purchase where we don\u0027t try to make it a little safer if we can.\" It\u0027s a fact that in the US, the federal government regulates every consumer product for health and safety, except for one: guns.Executive Director, Violence Policy CenterThe story of my daughter Harper is that everybody\u0027s life, even if they have special needs, has a purpose.Mom, medical cannabis advocateAfter years of tickling the dragon\u0027s tail, flirting with the demagoguery of America\u0027s right wing and egging on a growing rage within a core constituency of disaffected, working class white Americans, the dragon has started to breathe fire, and the flames have spread in all directions.Senior writer, BillMoyers.com. Former senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.We, like many of our constituents, have seen firsthand how this tragic epidemic has affected our own friends and loved ones, and by sharing their stories we hope to put a face to the addiction crisis.U.S. Representative, New Hampshire\u0027s second congressional districtBefore even being asked to comment again this year, the Blacademy spokesman whipped out a copy of last year\u0027s press release and highlighted: \"It\u0027s not that white actors weren\u0027t good, it\u0027s just that there were a lot of great performances by black actors this year.\"Novelist, Screenwriter, and Associate Professor at Columbia UniversityWriter and filmmakerTo be clear: God is not finished with the Episcopal Church yet. We have miles to go and much work to do to overcome the many systemic issues that continue to challenge us as we strive to live into our call to be the Body of Christ in the world.Episcopal priest and activist from Pasadena, Calif.We can keep dirty coal in the ground and protect our public lands from mining and generate electricity with clean energy and give people better jobs. Thanks to today\u0027s announcement, we\u0027re that much closer to making it happen.Executive Director, The Sierra ClubWe are medical workers, teachers, rescue workers and civil society activists who, along with hundreds of thousands of others, are living under siege in Syria. What makes our suffering more painful is knowing that UN warehouses full of lifesaving aid are often just minutes away.A global advocacy group standing in solidarity with non-violent Syrians and their struggle for a peaceful and dignified future.Monday was an important day for America\u0027s shrinking middle class. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, a case that could impose radical new limits on the rights of public sector workers -- like teachers, nurses, and firefighters -- to join together to win better lives for their families and communities.Executive Director, In the Public InterestNothing would make me happier than Hollywood getting serious with this and hiring proper diversity experts and giving them full power to create a safe, inclusive, diverse industry... but that looks like a pipe dream.Writer and directorTo be a woman is to be an invitation; to be a woman with a same-sex partner is to be a conquest; to say \"no\" to a man is to issue him a challenge; to say \"no\" twice, rather than conceding, is to be a bitch.Writer, humorist, book nerdLouisiana is extraordinary in that the primary source for public defense funding comes from fees defendants must pay if found guilty of a crime. That means public defenders can only guarantee their salary if enough of their clients are convicted of crimes. Acquittals are bad for business.Staff Attorney, ACLU\u0027s Criminal Law Reform ProjectNot all \"paid\" lawyers are good attorneys, and not all \"court-appointed\" lawyers and public defenders are bad. However, it is a sad but true fact, as Making A Murderer ably illustrates, that the quality of justice in this country directly correlates to the amount of resources a defendant has.Writer \u0026 LawyerNo one who has served our country should have to sleep on the streets - especially in our nation\u0027s capital. Soon, I know we will make that goal a reality.Laura Zeilinger is the director for the D.C. Department of Human Services.The Academy has made promise after promise to mend its ways and make diversity more than just a dictionary word for its 2016 awards. It\u0027s now 2016. And those who will march up to the podium to receive their awards again this year will look exactly like those who marched up their a year ago.Author and political analystThe cultivation of mindfulness requires periods of focused attention. Many proponents of mindfulness maintain that this is best developed through seated, silent meditation.

Centuries ago Christ called on his listeners to help the \"least among us.\" We should fulfill that challenge today.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteFlint\u0027s tap water serves as indictment of all those who believed that the private sector can fulfill our social needs and that tax cuts matter more than public investments.Author/Professor, Miami University, Oxford, OhioWhy did it happen?

I love that you are confidant in your place in this world.Lawyer, Writer, Photographer and All Things with JoyIn this age of ISIS -- and seemingly relentless eruptions of violence in the US and abroad -- is Dr. King\u0027s message of peace still relevant?Host of the public radio series “Humankind”I am dreading the day that my young son comes home from school hurt from his first experience of anti-Muslim bigotry.
