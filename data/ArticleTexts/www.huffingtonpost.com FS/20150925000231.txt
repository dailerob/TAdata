{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Executive Editor Of Global Spirituality and Religion, The Huffington PostPope Francis, in a powerful speech to the U.S. Congress Thursday morning, used his moral authority to speak out for compassion in regards to immigration, urgency in regards to care for the earth, and dialogue and peace when it comes to foreign affairs. He condemned the military industrial complex while emphasizing a special concern for the poorest among us. He mentioned his care for humans at all stages of life and used that as a springboard to talk about the death penalty. He spoke of his special interest in the family, and used that to launch into his desire for the young to be able to dream. It was a beautiful speech, full of heart for the least of these. However, I think we can lay to rest the idea that this is a pope that has no politics.Corporate lobbyists and their friends in the media spout free-market platitudes about why sky-high prices are necessary to promote innovation. It\u0027s time for a serious understanding of the policy issues.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia UniversityFailing to recognize Syria\u0027s crisis as fundamentally political and military in nature has led to a complete shortfall of ideas aimed at resolving it.

She lands at the feet of Ric O\u0027Barry, star of the Academy Award-winning documentary The Cove and ex-dolphin trainer turned activist, who is helpless to intervene. Exhausted, she gives up the will to live, takes a final breath and sinks to the bottom of Taiji cove, never to be seen again.Social responsibility advocateAs you hear a lot of talk in the news about a potential government shutdown, make sure you understand exactly what\u0027s at stake in the broader budget debate.Director of the Office of Management and BudgetDuring the discussion on the Iran nuclear deal, it has been strange to hear U.S. politicians fiercely condemn Iranian human rights abuses while remaining silent about worse abuses by U.S. ally Saudi Arabia.Co-founder, CODEPINK: Women for PeaceToday, with his address to Congress, Pope Francis gave a call to action. And I heard a specific \"to do\" list: End the death penalty, poverty, hunger, rampant capitalism, the exclusion of immigrants, war, the arms trade and environmental destruction.Catholic priest, peace activist, author of \"The Nonviolent Life,\" www.johndear.org, www.campaignnonviolence.orgIn the best of prophetic tradition, Pope Francis is calling us to be our best selves. He is calling us to go beyond personal piety, belief and charity to pursue justice, find patterns of living to care for the most vulnerable (including the Earth herself), and welcome the stranger.President, Auburn Theological SeminaryMy well-meaning family members and friends were trying to lend support, sympathy, and encouragement. I\u0027m appreciative that I was one of the hospital patients who had a table full of cards.

And by working together, we can meet the challenge. This message was crystal clear in the Pope\u0027s recent encyclical.Administrator, U.S.Environmental Protection AgencyBarring federal funding for Planned Parenthood, as some in Congress favor, would have a devastating impact on women\u0027s access to health care services through Medicaid -- especially family planning services -- and put many women\u0027s health at risk.Vice President for Health Policy, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesIn this week when they are suddenly out of favor, Noah Benjamin-Pollak offers, in rant form, 10 reasons to love e-books.Journal of Books and IdeasLet\u0027s be clear: the Catalan elections on Sunday, September 27th, are exceptional due to the explosive mix of emotions, political debate and intensity that have inoculated Spanish politics. But, the previous notwithstanding, will they be the first step towards an independent Catalonia?Editorial Director, El Huffington PostThe pope uses reason matched to principle to point out a simple truth -- climate change is happening and it will hit the weakest the hardest because they lack the resources to prepare.Dean of the US House of Representatives | Ranking Member, House Judiciary CommitteeMaybe someone can create the Perfectly Imperfect Barbie?

I really don\u0027t understand how folks can forget that truth about the history of the United States.Writer, Blogger at TheJuggleStruggle.netWhile authentic spirituality integrates the various elements of ordinary human life, the spirituality of prison disintegrates the human spirit. It does so first and foremost by denying everyday experiences and common human interaction to prisoners.Associate Professor of Religion, Belmont UniversityPope Francis, addressing climate change before a Congress dominated by Republicans -- more than half of whom deny its reality -- and Democrats who despair of doing anything about it, was a prophet of hope rather than doom.
