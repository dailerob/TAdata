{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOIn terms of race, in terms of history, politics and American life we\u0027ve crossed over to a better place and a more hopeful time. Not simply because of one man, but because we were prescient enough to have recognized ourselves and the true nature of America reflected in that one man. And then we set about the task of freeing ourselves from the darkness of this decade and the shadows that have for too long haunted us. In this respect, all of us -- all races -- are a little more free at last. After all these years, we\u0027ve finally arrived at moment when America feels like it\u0027s supposed to feel.Read Post | CommentsBIOHarry Shearer, 11.05.2008President-Elect Obama is clearly a very smart guy and a very good politician. Unlike the last Dem with those credentials, he\u0027s also exceedingly disciplined. Those qualities will come up against a couple of very major problems.Read Post | Comments (82)BIOScott Kesterson, 11.05.2008Sitting on a couch in front of the television in the early hours of the morning, an Army Captain watched as the election results were being reported. He shook his head in disgust.Read Post | Comments (35)BIOAlec Baldwin, 11.05.2008McCain had to do the hard thing -- to not only accept loss and graciously congratulate the winner, but to encourage the rest of the country to offer their blessings to the new President-elect and his family.Read Post | Comments (203)BIOKaren Dalton-Beninato, 11.05.2008Live from Santiago, Chile, there was an election night shout out from R.E.M. for the Huffington Post\u0027s election coverage.Read Post | CommentsBIOJohn Cusack, 11.05.2008The world looked to America... we showed our best. For one night at least, the world was sane. The planet sighs in relief and deserves a righteous party. We have beaten back the worst in ourselves.Read Post | Comments (129)BIOArianna Huffington, 11.04.2008Even if your candidate didn\u0027t win last night, you have reason to celebrate. We all do. Barack Obama\u0027s impressive victory says a lot about America. Because yesterday voters decided that they didn\u0027t want to look back. They wanted to step into the future.Read Post | Comments (891)BIOJohann Hari, 11.05.2008Mr President-Elect, there is a pile of ticking time-bombs waiting in your in-tray and you have to defuse each one of them, fast. Welcome to the next four years of your life.Read Post | CommentsBIOPaul Slansky, 11.05.2008I was convinced that the only way Barack Obama could win, the only path that didn\u0027t lead to Losertown or Wussville, was for him to channel the nation\u0027s outrage and eviscerate John McCain. Fortunately, Obama and his Davids knew better.Read Post | Comments (19)BIORoderick Spencer, 11.05.2008The proof of my children\u0027s lack of anxiety over their racial identity, is the amused, slightly puzzled way they watched their parents bawling our eyes out in front of Barack Obama\u0027s victory speech last night.Read Post | Comments (20)BIONora Ephron, 11.05.2008So we held our breath for twenty-two months, twenty-two months of an election that everyone claimed would bore us witless. The exact opposite turned out to be true: it was riveting.Read Post | Comments (133)BIOSasha Abramsky, 11.05.2008The tears running down my face last night and this morning were of something so much more than happiness, so much more than simple relief. They were an exhalation.Read Post | CommentsBIOHenry Blodget, 11.05.2008If President-Elect Obama were an incoming CEO, he would now be preparing for a massive write-off of the mountains of rotted junk buried on the company\u0027s balance sheet and an announcement that recovery will take a long, long time.Read Post | Comments (19)BIONaomi Klein, 11.05.2008I was in D.C. last night -- at 10:30 pm I happened to walk past a very stuffy private club, one that as far as I can tell, is populated exclusively by hardcore Republican men in their later years.Read Post | Comments (39)BIODavid Rees, 11.05.2008DO NOT OPERATE HEAVY MACHINERY. I realize this may further damage our economy, but I don\u0027t want to be around some forklift operator who suddenly realizes what the heck happened last night.Read Post | Comments (23)BIOTrey Ellis, 11.05.2008I love history and had often whined that I wasn\u0027t lucky enough to have lived during a more exciting age: I could have been a Tuskegee Airman, Buffalo Soldier, or beatnik. But last night history came to me.Read Post | Comments (99)BIORep. Barbara Lee, 11.05.2008I look forward to working with the entire progressive community in the months to come as we turn our focus away from elections and toward governing so we can quickly get our nation back on track.Read Post | CommentsBIOGary Hart, 11.04.2008The president-elect represents a new, post-Clinton, beyond centrism, post-racial, new politics, internet-driven phenomenon. The nation is fed up with neoconservative imperialists, radical fundamentalists, and failed supply-siders.Read Post | Comments (111)BIOCecile Richards, 11.05.2008It is hard to overstate the landslide victory for women last night. For too long, our health and rights have been used as a political battering ram.Read Post | Comments (24)Russell Simmons, 11.05.2008Hooman Majd, 11.04.2008Nathan Gardels, 11.05.2008Marty Kaplan, 11.05.2008Paul Hogarth, 11.05.2008Drew Westen, 11.05.2008George Stevens, Jr., 11.04.2008Mitchell Bard, 11.05.2008Cory Booker, 11.04.2008Jamie Lee Curtis, 11.04.2008Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, 11.05.2008Lee Camp, 11.05.2008Eric Schmeltzer, 11.05.2008Jeff Chang, 11.05.2008Marcia G.
