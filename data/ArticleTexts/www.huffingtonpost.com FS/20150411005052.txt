{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Worrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsThe next long race to the White House is now upon us, and those who comment professionally on the comings and goings of American political life already have an emerging list of potential presidential candidates to follow around yet again. And as they do so, if the past is any guide, the important issues that go on without change, day after day, are likely to fall out of public view once more. Or if they do not, they are likely to be downgraded -- in the dominant political dialogue -- into issues whose only importance is the light they shed on the standing of one political candidate or another. Poverty will likely be one such issue. Low wages, Income inequality, the rights of employees at work -- these are likely to be others. All of them are issues of class with which leading politicians are invariably reluctant systematically to engage.Becoming a grandmother has made me think deeply about the responsibility we all share as stewards of the world we inherit and will one day pass on.

I am tempted to suggest that it be a single topic so that it can get around the sound bite stuff. I would like to dig into one or two topics (go deep!) -- not slap the surface of many topics.Host, Fox News\u0027 \u0027On the Record With Greta Van Susteren\u0027I am beyond disbelief that even though there is a glaring problem with the policies of policing in New York City, coupled with an inherently flawed justice system, not one new law has been passed since a father of four was choked out on a hot, summer day last July in Staten Island.Founder, GlobalGrind.comThere\u0027s a real chance for change in relations here. We shouldn\u0027t let rhetoric put a nail in the coffin of trying to work a concrete deal come June -- and Congress shouldn\u0027t either.Host and producer, HuffPost LiveVideo or no video, prompt investigation and appropriate action following a police shooting -- just as with any possible crime -- should be the rule nationwide, not the exception. But these incidents are more than just bad-apple cops: The problem of unjustified lethal force is endemic.Director, ACLU\u0027s Criminal Law Reform ProjectThe public discussion about the causes of violent extremism has focused mainly on the socioeconomic and political conditions that exist in Arab countries. But we must also carefully consider how the events in the wake of World Wars I and II have impacted the psychological disposition of the Arab population throughout the Middle East.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUPresident Obama has called charter schools \"incubators of innovation\" and \"laboratories of innovation,\" and he has done so for several years, despite the fact that, so far, the laboratories have yielded nothing.Teacher and writer; blogger, curmudgucation.blogspot.comWhen promoter Peter Shapiro became aware of the article I wrote last month taking him to task for the way ticket sales were handled for the Grateful Dead\u0027s \"Fare Thee Well\" shows, scheduled for July 3-5 at Chicago\u0027s Soldier Field, he had two choices.Founder/publisher of Boulder Weekly, an award-winning alternative weekly in its 22nd year of publication.The more I taught and practiced, the more I realized that society\u0027s perception of the average yogi is not at all accurate. There are thousands of dedicated practitioners with bum knees and c-section scars and flabby arms and imperfect skin.Yogi, Contemplative, Writer. Producer of radio program Radical Spirituality and Sacred Activism. Spiritual Director of Hab Washington.We\u0027ve been asked many questions since choosing to adopt and becoming a transracial family. Did you get to name the kids? I thought all adopted kids had problems? Were your kids born addicted to drugs? Could you not have your own children? Do you do their hair?adoption and health speaker, blogger, and book author, mom of three, wife of Superman, Christian, former college English teacher turned kitchen-dance-party proIt\u0027s a \u002790s nightclub, an \u002780s aerobics video, a self-help convention and a liturgy. It\u0027s a mass of steam pipe-sweaty believers all moving in primal groupishness -- forward, back, left, right, always on the beat, always on the beat, always on the beat.Night Editor, The Huffington Post UKAmerica\u0027s decade-long experience in the post-9/11 Middle East has conditioned the American public, and by extension the American body politic, to embrace hyperbole and sensationalism over fact and nuance. In doing so, decisions are being made which do not reflect reality, and as such not only fail to rectify the situation at hand, but more often than not, exacerbate it.Author, \u0027Dangerous Ground\u0027What if college students and ex-offenders could live together, support and help each other find their place in society?Board Member of the Dismas House of South BendThe creams, lotions and potions you spend your hard-earned money on can offer surface benefits. But if the problem stems in the mind, slather on as much retinol as you want but the tension lines will remain if your heart rate is reminiscent of the jackhammer pounding on the sidewalk.Mind/Body Expert, Resident Neuroscientist at HeadspaceHere are a few things I\u0027ve done to help me be more intimate with my husband (often leading to some great sex). Some of these sound crazy, but stick with me.Mentor, intimacy coach, hand holder, lifter-upper of moms, dance party starter, date night lover, blogger at www.andiwickman.com.What any sensible Congress should be doing -- and what any sensible elite would be demanding -- is making the tax code more, not less progressive. Estate taxes should be higher; the various loopholes and dodges to escape them should be eliminated.President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureOutdoor play can help your preschooler develop his motor skills and strengthen his muscles and bones. Not only does your preschooler get a chance to lower his stress and anxiety through physical activities outside, but he also has the opportunity to connect to his natural self.Human Behavior, Parenting, and Education Expert, Speaker, Author. Ph.D., Ed.D., M.Ed.The supremely delightful Alex Da Corte\u0027s Die Hexe (The Witch) at Luxembourg and Dayan Gallery is surely the most engaging exhibition to emerge on the Upper East Side or anywhere in Manhattan in quite a while. It is not too late to scoop this last Easter Egg out of the basket.Culture Columnist, Huffington Post, CultureZohnHistory is still waiting to judge the conclusion of the Boston Marathon Bombing trial. But in the Tsarnaev case and many others, the standard that defense attorneys and prosecutors have tried to live up to for nearly a century has been the 12-hour closing argument by Charles Darrow in the trial of Leopold and Loeb.Sr. Investigative Reporter WGBH Radio Boston; Sr. Fellow Schuster Institute for Investigative Journalism, Executive Editor Lifted Veils ProductionsYet, while we gladly celebrate the Lord\u0027s Resurrection as the reality of life and hope, all around us in the world, we can hear the cries and threats of death launched in many parts of the planet by those who believe that they can resolve human conflicts by destroying their enemies, which in itself constitutes the greatest proof of their weakness.Spiritual leader of 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwideLos Angeles seems to be the testing grounds for the latest snake oil diets, weird versions of yoga, and other whacky mind and body improvement methods.

If you go down the road of watch notifications, you will become a #watchhole and alienate everyone around you.EntrepreneurJalape?os are giving way to habaneros and ghost peppers.BurgerBusiness.comI\u0027ve learned a lot of lessons in my relatively short, 12 years of marriage; the usuals -- like not saying the \"D\" word, accepting that my husband doesn\u0027t always flush the toilet, and that throwing wooden spoons at walls while cooking makes more work for me than trying to prove how mad I was. But there are a few important lessons I\u0027ve learned (mostly the hard way) that have truly helped save my marriage countless times.Author of the blog Pig \u0026 DacThere are so many questions we don\u0027t seem to be asking right now about the arrival of these potentially intelligent machines.
