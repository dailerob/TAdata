{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jason LinkinsEditor, Eat the PressBack in March of 2013, the Republican National Committee undertook an organization-wide wound-licking from its subpar 2012 campaign efforts, coming up with a report called the \"Growth And Opportunity Project.\" Colloquially known as the \"RNC autopsy,\" the report was billed as the \"most comprehensive post-election review\" ever attempted. And it lived up to the claim, at least on paper: the RNC examined every aspect of its campaign enterprise, from minority outreach to campaign technology upgrades to systemic reform of the nominating process to a call for greater communication between the RNC and outside groups. Toward the end of the year, I undertook a review of this review, and found that while the RNC had made some \"not insubstantial progress\" toward the goals laid out in their report, it didn\u0027t really seem that too many people either read the report or took it very seriously.Comments (575)Ben HallmanSenior Financial Writer, The Huffington PostRight now is a terrific time to buy a house in many parts of the U.S. -- if you have outstanding credit and a suitcase full of cash. For most everyone else, the market is increasingly out of reach. Here are four reasons why.Comments (230)Yulia TymoshenkoFmr. prime minister of Ukraine; Current leader of All-Ukrainian Union \"Fatherland\" (\"Batkivshchyna\")I feel sorry for the people of Russia. They are being led into a totalitarian abyss of economic and spiritual collapse which goes hand-in-hand with poverty and devastation. Using degrading and immoral means, the Russian government has destroyed the notion of truth with their mad propaganda for the occupation of Ukraine.Comments (317)Michael E. MannDirector of Penn State Earth System Science Center; Author of \u0027Dire Predictions\u0027 and \u0027The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars\u0027If the world keeps burning fossil fuels at the current rate, it will cross a threshold into environmental ruin by 2036. The \"faux pause\" could buy the planet a few extra years beyond that date to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and avoid the crossover -- but only a few.Comments (69)Kweku MandelaPresident, Out of Africa Entertainment; Co-Founder, Africa Rising FoundationMy grandfather would always say that if we as humans don\u0027t transcend this cycle of hatred and violence that we find ourselves in so often, we\u0027ll always be prisoners.CommentsGayatri Devi, M.D.Neurologist and Director of the New York Memory ServicesYour Buddha Nerve, better known as the vagus, is your body\u0027s built-in mechanism for thriving and for maintaining good health. So how do you turn it on?CommentsPaige DavisEntrepreneur, mind-body enthusiast and recent breast cancer survivorThere is really nothing that can prepare you for a cancer diagnosis. It is a shocking and momentary devastation that is overwhelming on so many different levels -- physically, emotionally and spiritually. But perhaps the greatest challenge is identifying the immediate logistical next steps of what a diagnosis means while you are trying to process these levels.Comments (12)Kareem Abdul-JabbarNBA Legend, Pop Culture columnistLike its gritty heroes, the show is mesmerizing, good-hearted, occasionally brilliant -- and occasionally flawed.Comments (38)Claire FallonBooks Editor, The Huffington PostDespite the judgment we exhibit toward people who err in enunciating, we all mispronounce a word from time to time, despite our best efforts.Comments (17)Kevin M. F. PlattAuthor, Terror and Greatness: Ivan and Peter as Russian MythsOne of the greatest challenges facing Ukraine is to rebuild the authority of its own media space and to articulate a shared understanding of politics, history and geography -- one that can overcome the now enormous divide between the two realities that Ukrainians now inhabit.CommentsWill BunchAuthor, \u0027Tear Down This Myth\u0027In the last few months, we\u0027ve seen something truly amazing happen. The 1 percent is in \"they fight you\" mode, in some of the crudest terms possible. They are attacking the movement for equity in the country, and -- at least rhetorically, for now -- they want to burn it.CommentsKiri WestbyChangemaker, Rulebreaker, StorytellerIn light of our very recent emancipation from the illegality of pot, I say it\u0027s high time that we lift the veil on marijuana and motherhood.Comments (467)Joseph A. DominoAdjunct professorFor those unfamiliar with the term \"adjunct,\" it is considered a part-time supplemental teaching position. To virtually earn somewhere between $10-13 and hour for performing college-level instruction speaks plainly of the Walmartization of our nation\u0027s colleges and universities.CommentsAlanna VagianosEditorial Fellow, HuffPost WomenDespite my vehement support for Knox, her career and her right to make whatever choices she deems empowering and necessary, the overwhelming emotion I felt was discomfort. It was the least sexy sexual experience I\u0027ve ever had.CommentsDerrell JamisonMan of God, Husband, U.S. Airman, \u0026 Writer.I\u0027m sorry, but I\u0027m not sorry that we don\u0027t want kids yet. We\u0027ll have them one of these days, but for now, we\u0027re just enjoying our time learning to live with each other before we throw a little one into the mix.CommentsMark CubanOwner, Dallas Mavericks; Chairman, AXS TVLike Hollywood, today\u0027s nouveau entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley are looking past the pitch right in front of them to the next source of capital who will pay a higher valuation.CommentsPoorna BellLifestyle Editor Huffington Post UK87% of people would pick being happy over money, and the chief reason for happiness was their relationships with their friends and family. In other words: not money or what it can buy.CommentsRichard (RJ) EskowSenior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourSocial mobility in the United States is at or near its lowest point in modern history. A nation that prides itself on the \"only in America\" myth has fallen far behind other countries in this, the primary measurement of an equal-opportunity society. In the midst of this class ossification, higher education remains a powerful tool for social mobility.Comments (15)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027The argument of the generational warriors is that the Social Security and Medicare benefits received by our parents and grandparents pose a threat to the living standards of our children and grandchildren. The generational warfare argument may not make much sense, but many people with money stand behind it.Comments (148)Rep. Debbie Wasserman SchultzAuthor, \u0027For the Next Generation\u0027; Chair, Democratic National CommitteeWhat the RNC and the Republican Party still don\u0027t understand is that their biggest problem has never been their primary calendar, their campaign tactics, or a lack of trainings. Their biggest problem is who they are, what they believe, what they say, and how they govern.Comments (166)Julia MeszarosDoctoral candidate at Florida International University in the Global Sociocultural Studies DepartmentI wonder, once public education is destroyed in this country, will we revert back to the days where only wealthy students were guaranteed an education? Will poor students need to find a wealthy benefactor, like Mozart did, in order to attain an education?Comments (85)Mohamed A. El-ErianChief Economic Advisor, AllianzAs many of you know, Netflix releases the entire new season of House of Cards in one go. In contrast, the new episodes of Downton Abbey come in weekly installments. Which is better?CommentsRob ReinaldaWriter/editor; 28 years in newspapersTo set things straight -- and with a nod to Mrs. Malaprop (go on, Google it) -- I offer the following glossary, with which all writers, editors, and other communicators should become familiar.CommentsSusie MooreLife Coach, New York CityBefore we are employees, parents, spouses and friends, we are individuals. Our gifts and talents, the ones we reveled in exploring as a child, are still as present as they ever were. They just lie dormant within us hoping for release. It is our obligation to make them a priority like we do our workouts, our careers and the people we love.CommentsChris BoeskoolBlogs at theboeskool.com about Jesus, politics, and bathroom humorI believe the only right and rational response to a man who spends his whole life carrying around signs (literal or figurative) that say \"God Hates You\" is to proclaim to the world, with our words and our life, that \"God Loves You!\"CommentsMatt WalshBlogger, talk radio host, father of twinsI usually look upon the media\u0027s shameless sensationalism with a sort of bemused indifference. But I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever been quite as disgusted as I am now, while I watch these news channels and publications turn the likely death of some 280 people into a Tom Clancy novel.Comments (20)Debra PickettAuthor, \u0027Reporting Lives\u0027; Media Consultant; Former Newspaper Columnist; Mom of 3 BoysI was having one of those working mom moments when you feel all conflicted and then get mad at yourself for feeling all conflicted because the men in the office certainly aren\u0027t and then you either go the rest room and cry for minute or pull yourself together and get on with your day.CommentsBarbra StreisandSinger; Actress; Director; Composer; ActivistThe critics say we need industrial agriculture to feed the growing population of the world. We\u0027re told that we cannot go back to natural, regenerative, organic farming as the way we grow our food. In short, this isn\u0027t true.Comments (75)David L. PhillipsDirector of the Program on Peace-building and Rights, Columbia University’s Institute for the Study of Human RightsThe referendum in Crimea was neither an exercise in democracy, consulting Crimeans on important decisions about their future; nor was it an effective conflict management tool, distributing power between competing interests.CommentsKate GavinoWriter, ArtistSome sequels are masterpieces (Huckleberry Finn, Lord of the Rings, Through the Looking Glass), and others are pleasant surprises (Doctor Sleep, the most recent Bridget Jones) but there are a few that deserve to stay hidden deep in the discount bin.CommentsYagana ShahAssociate Editor, Huff/Post 50If you think about it, we\u0027re not so different from our younger selves.
