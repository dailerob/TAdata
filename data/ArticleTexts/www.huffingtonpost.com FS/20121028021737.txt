{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Director, Wall Street documentary \u0027Inside Job\u0027; Author, \u0027Predator Nation\u0027There is a scandal in Mitt Romney\u0027s campaign -- namely Glenn Hubbard, Romney\u0027s chief economic advisor, who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors under George W. Bush, and is now Dean of Columbia Business School. First, Hubbard has an abysmal track record in economic policy, including the very issues that Romney has made the pillar of his presidential campaign. Second, like Romney, Hubbard refuses to disclose critical information about his income, conflicts of interest, and paid advocacy activities. Third, both in public statements and in my personal experience, Hubbard has been evasive, misleading, and even dishonest when discussing both policy issues and his own conflicts of interest. And last but not least, those conflicts of interest are huge: Hubbard has long advocated policies that Wall Street loves, often without disclosing that he is, in fact, highly paid by Wall Street.Read Post | Comments (647)Michelangelo Signorile, 10/26/12Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesWe\u0027ve witnessed many Mitt Romneys, but the one unearthed yesterday is perhaps the most vicious and cruel: a zealot who, as Massachusetts governor, became hellbent on stigmatizing the children of gay and lesbian parents, labeling them outcasts and causing them to suffer hardship throughout their lives.Read Post | Comments (2,525)Paul Douglas, 10/25/12Chief Meteorologist, \"WeatherNation TV\"; Star Tribune\u0027s \"On Weather with Paul Douglas\"I\u0027m tracking Hurricane Sandy and I\u0027m sharing some of my thinking with HuffPost readers who may be personally impacted over the next 4-5 days.Read Post | Comments (180)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 10/27/12Author, research psychologist, and gender scholarI have good friends. They are in a mixed marriage: she\u0027s a Republican, he\u0027s a Democrat. Both take their respective affiliations seriously. They\u0027ve always made their union of political opposites work. But this season, there is coolness in the political air.Read Post | Comments (51)Philip Rosenthal, 10/27/12Writer and producerI don\u0027t really think it\u0027s appropriate to write about something so personal on the Internet, it certainly doesn\u0027t feel right, but nothing feels right today. I lost a brother.Read Post | CommentsJames Zogby, 10/27/12President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Listening to this \"kinder and gentler\" Romney, two questions came to mind. Was all this a tactical ploy to sway undecided voters? Or was this the candidate\u0027s declaration of independence from his neo-conservative advisers (three-quarters of whom are George W. Bush alumni)?Read Post | Comments (133)Keith Thomson, 10/26/12Reporter and authorIn the United States, 35 percent of this year\u0027s general election votes will be cast on electronic voting machines that are said to have been \"designed with insufficient attention to computer security.\"Read Post | Comments (739)Geoffrey R.

Besides the reward of letting go of a painful past, there are powerful health benefits that go hand-in-hand with the practice of forgiveness.Read Post | CommentsPaul Yeager, 10/27/12Meteorologist and Author of \u0027Weather Whys: Facts, Myths, and Oddities\u0027With so much information being generated from weather and non-weather sources, it\u0027s difficult to separate fact from fiction.
