{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressSen. Marco Rubio enjoys a bit of favor in the media at the end of a month in which he actually lost ground in the polls and gave a poor showing in terms of fundraising. Did his poll numbers shift, signifying a massive change in public favor toward him? Did he unveil an innovative policy idea that got all the wonks agog and impressed? Did he effectively counter one of his opponents in a convincing way? No. Rubio had a good weekend, but not for any of the traditional reasons you would associate with a successful campaign on the upswing. Rather, he is winning where it counts: in the ghastly, money-soaked grotesquerie that has replaced our democracy.Poor Jeb. Or I should say, Poor Jeb! It\u0027s unfathomable how he thought that he could run for the Republican nomination without having to wrestle with his brother\u0027s record as president.JournalistThe three aggressive great powers today -- Russia, China, and the United States -- have made their very identities inseparable from status-seeking strategies. These combine a quest for mastery with extravagant military theater -- that could spin out-of-control at any time.Professor at The Johns Hopkins University Advanced Academic Programs and adviser to the Kiernan GroupOn Black Friday, many other sports retailers will be open. They will advertise their specials, and REI will lose some sales. But I think REI is onto something. The company is saying, \"We can win the hearts and minds of our employees with a policy of generosity and consideration.\"Author, \u0027Rocket: Eight Lessons to Secure Infinite Growth\u0027Peace talks that are dominated by American voices, Russian voices, Iranian voices, Saudi voices, may provide the opportunity for a de-escalation and perhaps some kind of ceasefire, but without greater involvement of Syrian society, the talks cannot bring lasting peace.Founder, KaramaPresident Obama has been using his executive power to try to promote good workplace practices among federal contractors. But at the same time, his administration has been looking to restructure federal agencies with the hope of saving money by downgrading the job quality of large numbers of positions.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Ernest Johnson, whose intellectual disability is clear, is scheduled to be executed by lethal injection sometime after 6 p.m. on Tuesday. Ernest has scored under or around 70 on IQ tests throughout his life. He has shown typical signs of intellectual disability since he was a schoolboy: He struggled to speak and walk at the usual age. Young Ernest couldn\u0027t keep himself clean.Senior staff attorney, ACLU Capital Punishment ProjectIf Hillary Clinton or Carly Fiorina succeeds in their 2016 bid, will Bill Clinton or Frank Fiorina really be known as the First Gentleman? It seems an oddly ornate title. Soon after Washington\u0027s first inauguration in April 1789, suggestions in Congress that he be known as \"His Excellency\" or \"His Highness\" were rejected.Author, \"The Washingtons: George and Martha, \u0027Join’d by Friendship, Crown’d by Love\u0027”Here is the story of how Elon Musk became a self-made billionaire and the real-life inspiration for Iron Man\u0027s Tony Stark.waitbutwhy.comTechnology connects us, but changes the nature of our relationships. We have more \"friends\" than ever, but lack the bonding we yearn for.

The sooner we stop wasting our time tilting at legislative and ballot windmills, the better.Director of Advocacy, SPARTAAt the end of November, delegations from nearly 200 countries will convene for what is billed as the most important climate meeting ever held. A failure to cap carbon emissions worldwide guarantees not just climate shocks, but also instability, insurrection, and warfare.Author and Professor of Peace and World-Security Studies, Hampshire CollegeRepublicans, in mid-game, are now trying to dictate the terms of the debates. Donald Trump is even negotiating directly with television executives in an effort to alter the content and format. The unprecedented blitz sends a clear message that if moderators aren\u0027t nice to candidates, and if there are any objections over \"tone,\" future debates might get yanked.Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaWhile reading news stories about the \"deaf, mute girl\" in mainstream American outlets, however, I can\u0027t help but feel like we\u0027ve transported a half century backwards in our acceptance of deafness.Sign Language Interpreter, Community Educator, Advocate. From 3 Generations of Deaf familyIf we cannot agree that access to care is a foundational human right and not something to be restricted for the privileged few -- that access is not something to be earned -- then we have lost half of the battle already.Patient and advocateThe transformation to an Internet of Things infrastructure and a Third Industrial Revolution paradigm is forcing a wholesale rethinking of economic theory and practice.Author, \u0027The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of Things, the Collaborative Commons, and the Eclipse of Capitalism\u0027It is cynically using you, the \"regular people,\" as human shields to hide behind, and to deflect criticism, so that the public and the media won\u0027t recognize what it has become.Senior Fellow at New America, author of \"Raw Deal: How the \u0027Uber Economy\u0027 and Runaway Capitalism Are Screwing American Workers\"No one mentions the ways the children are failed, how it is not the responsibility of students of color to educate their ignorant white teachers. No one is horrified that these students were yet again disadvantaged by a system we hold up as the best way for these same kids to get a leg up.Blogs at Accidental Devotional and is the author of Consent Based ParentingKurt Vonnegut\u0027s Slaughterhouse-Five gets the James Franco treatment on Audible Studio\u0027s audiobook version of the classic. Vonnegut\u0027s breakthrough masterpiece brought him international praise and cult status, and Franco\u0027s read personalizes the adventures of Billy Pilgrim with a mix of innocence and eventual world-weariness.Trafficbeat Entertainment, Music Biz VetHis evangelical peers knew little of Soong-Chan\u0027s America, and their misunderstanding of his world underscored the depth of racial and economic splintering within evangelicalism. He learned that this divide was largely fueled by intentional racial partitioning by white religious leaders.Author of Rescuing Jesus: How People of Color, Women and Queer Christians are Reclaiming EvangelicalismWe probably already know how the Republican and Democratic candidates will answer these questions, but it is always good to get their views on the record and let the public see where they stand. This is particularly important because, according the public opinion polls, Americans overwhelmingly support affirmative answers to these questions.E.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeJust because kids are heavy media consumers doesn\u0027t mean that nothing good is going on nor does it indicate that kids are necessarily consuming that much more media than they were before the Internet.Technology journalistSaturday was another somber day for the country. I preached at the funeral for 31-year-old Corey Jones, who was waiting for a tow truck in the early hours of October 18 when he was shot and killed by a plainclothes officer with no badge, in an unmarked car.President, National Action NetworkBrainstorm meetings are the places where good ideas go to die, unfortunately.

Hazy memories had penetrated my armour of denial. He\u0027d come into the room in the middle of the night. He\u0027d pulled my clothes off. He\u0027d pushed inside me. I\u0027d tried to stop him but I was half asleep, confused, still under the effects of alcohol.A thirty-ish outwardly well-functioning LondonerHipster Jesus, you may have been a fantasy after all. Maybe if I truly want to live what I say I believe, it\u0027s time to stop defining you at all, even for myself. Life is short, and the only certainty is death. I don\u0027t want to spend my tiny moment here arguing over what is right for others.Comedian, writer, producerHis style may portend that a new generation of politicians can lead us away from the hyper-partisan, rancorous and unproductive climate of today\u0027s democracy to a new era of thoughtful discussion, open government and productive action.Advisor to government and business leaders; Author, The Digital Economy, 20th Anniversary EditionYou were too scared to commit to the avocado and now you\u0027ve left it too late.

Especially the good ones.Michelle Andrews is a 21-year-old blogger from Melbourne, Australia with an unhealthy addiction to popcorn and men in beanies.No American politician who has run for president has survived the media and voter hostility that Hillary Rodham Clinton has.
