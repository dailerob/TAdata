{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week, Paul Ryan proposed a new budget that would take spending back to 1948 levels (and showed he must not have been paying attention on Election Night 2012); freshman senator Ted Cruz proved that smugness and sexism are alive and well in the U.S. Senate; and Big Gulp-loving New Yorkers got a fizzy reprieve when a judge halted Mayor Bloomberg\u0027s super-size soda ban. But the biggest news of the week was delivered via a plume of white smoke: the announcement of a precedent-setting new pope, Francis I, the first Jesuit pope, and the first Latin American pope (aka \"The Holy Si\"). But much about the new pope is decidedly archaic, particularly his demonization of homosexuals (he has called same sex marriage \"a scheme to destroy God\u0027s plan\"). Perhaps one day a plume of rainbow-colored smoke will rise over the Vatican, heralding the selection of a pope with more enlightened ideas on \"God\u0027s plan.\"Comments (166)Jim WallisChristian leader for social changeWhile these are enormous challenges for Pope Francis, the grace of God is sufficient for faithful church leaders to lead. And Jorge Bergoglio is said to be such a man of God -- fervent in personal faith and consistent prayer.Comments (618)Daniel EllsbergFormer American military analyst who sparked a national uproar in 1971.Today, the Freedom of the Press Foundation has published an audio recording of Bradley Manning\u0027s speech to a military court from two weeks ago, in which he gives his reasons and motivations behind leaking over 700,000 government documents to WikiLeaks.Comments (1,299)Arianna HuffingtonIt\u0027s become accepted wisdom that Washington has become pathologically polarized and partisan, with every new debate inevitably breaking down along party lines. That\u0027s why it was so remarkable last week when Rand Paul\u0027s old-fashioned talking filibuster scrambled the even more old-fashioned right-vs.-left way of looking at the world.Comments (624)Michael MooreOscar and Emmy-winning directorSomeday a Sandy Hook mother -- or a Columbine mother, or an Aurora mother, or a mother from massacres yet to come -- will say, like the mother of Emmett Till, \"I just want the world to see.\" And then nothing about guns in this country will ever be the same again.Comments (3,494)Stacey KramerFounder, BrandPlayI lost a friend and colleague last spring. His diagnosis was way worse than mine. He was not so lucky.Comments (272)Gary HartPresident, Hart International, Ltd.Underlying all the media focus on the cardinals\u0027 selection of a new pope, and the predictable focus on personality over meaning, was a much greater struggle between tradition and reform, conservatism and progress. That struggle mirrors politics in America and most western democracies.Comments (36)Norman LearFounder, People for the American WayIf anybody can tell me that there are another two syllables that can express what lies just beneath the consciousness of most Americans at this minute -- and all Americans when they know what they are angry minute about, I want to know what that is.Comments (194)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistHere\u0027s a riddle: A trucker is sitting in a bar next to a feminist. They\u0027ve both had a lot to drink and they\u0027re arguing. The feminist says women have been oppressed for centuries -- the trucker says they haven\u0027t. The feminist says women deserve equal pay -- the trucker says they don\u0027t. The feminist says a woman should be president -- the trucker just laughs.Comments (2,285)Aaron BelkinAuthor, How We Won: Progressive Lessons from the Repeal of \"Don\u0027t Ask, Don\u0027t Tell\"Although the invasion was not Rove\u0027s idea, he could have stopped it, probably with ease. He failed to do so, however, because he anticipated, correctly, that the war would divide the Democrats down the middle, and that the division would benefit the Bush administration politically.Comments (113)Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoThe military\u0027s argument that Bradley Manning violated the aiding the enemy statute is clearly ill-founded.Comments (242)Lee WoodruffCo-author, \u0027In an Instant\u0027, Author, \u0027Perfectly Imperfect\u0027The first time I met acclaimed artisan Barney Bellinger, he was walking in my sister\u0027s house with a school kid\u0027s grin and a big basket of mushrooms.CommentsLewis LaphamEditor of Lapham\u0027s QuarterlyOver the course of the last two centuries, animals have become all but invisible in the American scheme of things, drummed out of the society of their myth-making companions, gone from the rural as well as the urban landscape.Comments (122)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundIs this the best we have to pass on to our children and grandchildren and the next generation of leaders the nation and world need today and tomorrow? Do corporate profits from dangerous products or harmful practices trump children\u0027s security and safety in our nation?Comments (214)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorWalmart CEO Mike Duke makes approximately $11,000 an hour. Think about that -- $11,000 every hour. Think about an hour of your day, the tasks you accomplish, and the compensation you receive from your employer.Comments (689)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarIt\u0027s important to raise children to value honesty, and to prevent lying from becoming frequent and consistent, the point at which lying is most troublesome. The first step in figuring out how to address a lie is to consider why your child is telling it. Is the child trying to avoid trouble? Save face?Comments (56)Al GoreChairman, Generation Investment Management and The Climate Reality ProjectThe level of inequality in the U.S. is already worse than in Egypt or Tunisia, two nations rocked in recent years by popular uprisings that overthrew national governments during the Arab Spring.Comments (1,671)Margaret Wheeler JohnsonWomen\u0027s EditorI think of fear as an imaginary friend, but the kind you don\u0027t dismiss along with childhood\u0027s other phantoms.Comments (52)Eric E. SchmidtExecutive Chairman, GoogleIt\u0027s up to others, outside of Silicon Valley, well beyond the tech sector, to embrace an innovation agenda if we are truly to build a new economy -- and new future -- that will endure for generations. Thankfully, this is already happening in places that have historically been at the forefront of innovation: America\u0027s cities.Comments (92)Jennifer SegalOnce Upon a ChefIn this traditional Irish stew, lamb is braised in a Guinness-spiked broth along with carrots, potatoes and bright green peas. Served with a crusty loaf of bread, it\u0027s the perfect hearty fare for a St. Patrick\u0027s Day feast.CommentsPaul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostWhen the now familiar face of the Cardinal from Buenos Aires appeared I found myself shouting at the screen: \"who is that?\" And soon we knew: Pope Francis, potentially the most transformative pope the church has seen in 50 years.Comments (181)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorI\u0027d been discussing the absolute non-reality of his proposal -- how the numbers don\u0027t begin to add up, the unrealistic budget cuts, the plethora of magic asterisks in the absence of actual proposals -- and the interviewer was like, \"OK... but if you\u0027re right, why is his budget front page news?\"Comments (968)Kathryn E. LivingstonAuthor, \"All About Motherhood\"In addition to the angst caused by the fact that my son was leaving home was this new twist: It was possibly the first time it seemed like he was the grown-up and I was the kid.Comments (317)Rocky KistnerMedia associate, NRDCThe new pontiff\u0027s role in assisting the world\u0027s disadvantaged will be inextricably linked to the ravages of climate change, the fast-growing global crisis that will hit the rising global impoverished populations hard with increasingly deadly droughts, floods and storms.Comments (88)Russell BergerHead Trainer for CrossFit Inc.In his recent critique of CrossFit, blogger Matthew Basso succeeds in warning readers of an alarmingly dangerous, unorthodox, and ineffective fitness program. The only drawback to Basso\u0027s article is that he critiques a program that doesn\u0027t exist.Comments (125)Melinda GatesCo-chair, the Bill and Melinda Gates FoundationWe all want to bring every good thing to our children. My daughter and her friends want to have the power to choose a rewarding future for themselves. Girls in countries like Niger want the same thing.Comments (45)Jim Yong KimPresident, World Bank GroupIt\u0027s no easy task to re-build after a descent into conflict. We need to transform the way we all engage with fragile and conflict-affected states. So what does it take?Comments (47)Seth ShostakSenior Astronomer, SETI InstituteImagine a world where the Sun doesn\u0027t shine -- ever. A place where there are nights but no days, and where the term \"year\" has no meaning. On such an unlit world, you\u0027ll never see anything in the sky brighter than the puny sparkle of the stars.Comments (20)John KinnearAuthor of AskYourDadBlog.comBefore she starts quoting Faulkner and writes a fan-fiction sequel to \"The Sound and the Fury,\" I decided now would be a good time to write down some of the toddlerisms that are slowly fading away from her mind.Comments (256)Mark Hyman, MDPracticing physicianThese ideas are false. They are food and diet industry propaganda that make and keep us fat and sick. Lies by the food industry combined with bad government policy based on food industry lobbying are the major cause of our obesity and diabetes epidemic.Comments (576)Peter DiamandisChairman/CEO, X PRIZE FoundationI spoke with founder Jack Hughes, who filled me in on TopCoder\u0027s humble beginnings at a picnic table, and the way the company approaches its innovative contest-driven, gamified, crowdsourcing solutions.CommentsRoger Hickey, 2013.17.03Stephenie Zamora, 2013.17.03Les Leopold, 2013.17.03Jordan Schultz, 2013.17.03Domonique Foxworth, 2013.17.03John Brown, 2013.17.03Richard (RJ) Eskow, 2013.17.03Craig Crawford, 2013.17.03Mohamed A.
