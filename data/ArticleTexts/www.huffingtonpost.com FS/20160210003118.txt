{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Novelist and contributing opinion writerBreathlessly, Republicans await the outcome of today\u0027s New Hampshire primary. In times past, New Hampshire was, variously, a check on Iowa, a force for moderation, a safe haven for front runners, a boon to long shots, and quicksand for the presumably anointed. In this unconventional year, it will likely alter the trajectory of the presumptive leaders -- not least because of Marco Rubio\u0027s Saturday night train wreck -- as well as of those in the second tier, muddling the contest for \"mainstream\" candidate while winnowing the brace of also-rans. But that death knell we are hearing is not just the mercy killing of walking footnotes like Carly Fiorina. It is for the GOP establishment and, more profoundly, for the very idea of what a president should be.Clinton still has a gap to traverse to lock in votes this primary season. She\u0027s already made significant changes to her campaign to change course and not repeat 2008. But schooling young women on what it means to be a feminist isn\u0027t going to win any votes.Host/Producer, HuffPost LiveLONDON -- Humanity is everybody\u0027s business, and an education is everybody\u0027s right. So it shouldn\u0027t fall only to governments and international agencies to provide aid during a crisis. Inside the humanitarian tent we need charities, philanthropists, businesses and social enterprises all working together.Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationComing from a small place we had a certain trust for the police and other authority figures. This was one of the things we had to learn when we came to the U.S. Seeking out the police for safety led to our family being detained and being sent to Miami Dade detention facility.Staff member with the Black Alliance for Just ImmigrationMy country is placing me in a position where I become a hurricane blazing through everything in my path. Just one month passed by and dozens of people lost their jobs, were told off by their bosses, got reported on. Now they are all unemployed.Activist, Pussy Riot band memberTo vote for her in the primaries, I would need to believe that the establishment on both the right and the left have so thoroughly strangled the political system that it is no longer \"reasonable\" to even try for reform.A woman who lifts heavy things up and put them back downWhat\u0027s the best way to thank Afghans who have risked their lives helping U.S. troops? Offer them a chance to live in America, and then make the process impossible and the costs astronomical.Writer/directorThere are so many levels to Formation that those of us who felt it, really feel it. There really isn\u0027t (that) much to joke about. Or waste time hating on.Director of Digital Media at GoodsperoOur democracy is strongest when everyone is able to participate, and it is time to fulfill that promise to the American people. The people should be selecting their leaders, not the other way around.First Vice Chair, Congressional Progressive Caucus; U.S. Representative for Wisconsin\u0027s 2nd DistrictCo-chair, Congressional Progressive Caucus; U.S. Representative for Minnesota\u0027s 5th DistrictEach year, I vie to redefine the popular conception of Valentine\u0027s Day. It is, in so many ways, unpopular. This shows with the professing of arbitrary, expensive romance and the nickname \"Single\u0027s Awareness Day.\" But to keep this holiday as a purely romantic holiday is short-sighted, while its potential is so vast.Writer? Check.Geek? You bet.Dinosaur? Still in discussion with scientistsI think that the Sanders campaign might represent a positive shift for the discussion of certain topics within the Democratic Party. However, for all the positive things his campaign represents, it also represents something deeply problematic: a fetishization of not knowing.PhD Candidate in Political Science at Brown UniversityThe citizens of Flint deserve much more than a steady convoy of trucks carrying privately donated bottled water. They deserve a full-fledged humanitarian military deployment, and a steady convoy of trucks carrying the equipment needed to repair their broken infrastructure and homes.Thinker, writer and speaker.The thing is, the average voter -- the one who\u0027s going to trudge through a half-foot of snow on Tuesday and decide the New Hampshire primary -- doesn\u0027t care all that much about North Korea and its missile launches. What he or she really cares about is a system that is rigged against them.Author, \u0027The Bern Identity\u0027The price tag for replacing the lead pipes that contaminated its drinking water is now estimated at up to $1.5 billion. No one knows where that money will come from or when it will arrive. In the meantime, the cost to the children of Flint has been and will be incalculable.Ronald H. Lauterstein Professor of Public Health, Columbia UniversityDistinguished Professor of History, John Jay College of Criminal JusticeKerry has come dangerously close to seeing the Syrian conflict as a binary fight between two forms of ruthless dictatorship -- Assad and the Islamic State group. This is exactly how Assad frames the conflict, and it is one of the main reasons why ISIS is growing in strength.Editor, Middle East EyeSecretary Hillary Clinton has accepted millions in \"speaking fees\" and campaign contributions from interest groups - most notably Wall Street firms - that she will be in a position to help or hurt as president. She promises that the money will not influence her if she takes office, but voters are understandably skeptical.Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureAlthough Puerto Rico\u0027s 3.5 million residents are Americans, they are not represented by voting members of Congress, helping to often make them afterthoughts in congressional debates. But the island\u0027s problems are neither small nor remote.Vice President for State Fiscal Policy, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesTrump is destined to disappear from this Kafkaesque nightmare that has captivated media coverage over the past half year or so -- and the sooner the better. Donald Trump will lose in New Hampshire and America will benefit.Author, The Evolution of a Revolution, and Fracktured (March, 2016)Parents, your kids will be fine if they don\u0027t start -- as long as you\u0027re fine! For the first time my son didn\u0027t start today, and I couldn\u0027t have been prouder. He was the only one on the bench standing and cheering for his teammates.Special Education Teacher, Varsity Football Coach, ConsultantAs the Democratic presidential race heats up, the debate on financial reform has taken a bizarre twist. Somehow the measure of a good reform is its ability to prevent another 2008-type financial crisis.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027The reason some people are above the law is because of advice like Nussbaum\u0027s. She doubts people will stand up to power and tells survivors that seeking justice is futile. Nussbaum is wrong. Some people will stand up -- sometimes at great personal cost -- and survivors can find justice.Smile Collector. Cyclist. Survivor.It is time once again to peer deeply into my somewhat-foggy crystal ball, and attempt to pick the winners of tomorrow night\u0027s New Hampshire primary. Before I get to that, though, some old business needs to be brought up. First, we have some very recent old business and then some truly ancient business, so bear with me.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comThree months ago, my then-boyfriend, Craig, got down on one knee and asked me to marry him. I cried with excitement. After all, it was a huge moment in my life that was exceptionally exciting, special and celebration-worthy. But is it an accomplishment? No.Natalie Brooke, an Atlanta native, is the Vice President of Client Relationships for Resurgent Performance, a community bank advisory groupWords can do incredible damage, but they can\u0027t hold a candle to silence. Often it is those words that have been withheld which leave the greatest scars upon us. It is in that terrible absence that we are dealt the harshest blow by those who claim to love us.Pastor and WriterDrunk drivers, earthquakes, cancer, shooters -- and now cranes. It\u0027s rattling to be reminded how vulnerable we are. We busy our lives to distract ourselves from mortality, to extract meaning from absurdity, to pretend we control a cosmos of chance. At best, what I get from Worth Street is the gong of mindfulness. Savor the moment. Hug your children. Don\u0027t go back to sleep. At worst: Grow up. It\u0027s all hanging by a thread.USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorIf you think that we need a leader who will push to change the way we see the world then it makes perfect sense to imagine Bernie as the realistic candidate, the one who will get things done.Author of a dozen books, including \u0027The End of Nature\u0027 and \u0027Deep Economy\u0027If you haven\u0027t talked to your child\u0027s teacher about what their lesson plans are for Black History Month (or for any subject), I encourage you to do so.The burden of education isn\u0027t solely on the teachers. It\u0027s my responsibility, as well. There are many opportunities available for what your children learn. You just have to ask.Writer and bloggerWe\u0027re already seeing a transition to clean, renewable energy and away from fossil fuels. President Obama knows that the only way to build on the progress and promise of the Paris climate summit is to accelerate that transition and base our fossil fuel policy on the mandate to \"keep it in the ground\" whenever and wherever possible.Executive Director, The Sierra ClubYou don\u0027t need more motivation. You don\u0027t need to be inspired to action. You don\u0027t need to read any more lists and posts about how you\u0027re not doing enough. There\u0027s a magic beyond us that works in ways we can\u0027t understand.Writer based in Los AngelesOne little-known fact this year is that Hillary Clinton and Marco Rubio have benefited from prison lobbyist money. In fact, they\u0027ve taken almost the same amount of contributions from major prison lobbyists. Clinton\u0027s campaign has received $133,246 while Rubio\u0027s campaign accepted $133,450 from the prison lobby.Columnist published in The Cleveland Plain Dealer, The Baltimore Sun, The Hill, Salon, The Jerusalem Post www.hagoodman.comIn this episode of \"Scheer Intelligence\", Robert Scheer sits down with potential Green party presidential candidate, Jill Stein, to discuss her plans and why she thinks the Green Party is more relevant than ever.Editor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027They Know Everything About You\u0027Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
