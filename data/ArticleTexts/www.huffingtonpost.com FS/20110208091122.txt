{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"When Kenny Lerer and I co-founded The Huffington Post in May 2005, we had high hopes. But even we would have been hard put to predict that less than six years later we would be able to announce a deal that now makes it possible for us to execute our vision at light speed. AOL is an online pioneer that engenders great trust among its 250 million global users. HuffPost is on the cutting edge of creating news that is social and brings with it a distinctive voice and a highly engaged audience. In this case, 1 + 1 \u003d 11. Far from changing our editorial approach, our culture, or our mission, this moment will be, for HuffPost, like stepping off a fast-moving train and onto a supersonic jet. We\u0027re still traveling toward the same destination, with the same people at the wheel, and with the same goals, but we\u0027re now going to get there much, much faster.Read Post | CommentsJose Antonio Vargas, 02.07.2011Senior Contributing Editor, Huffington PostEach generation develops its own relationship with technology.

Journalism has become an interactive, communal exercise in self-education.Read Post | CommentsDean Baker, 02.07.2011Co-Director of the Center for Economic and Policy ResearchThe right uses government all the time to advance its interest by setting rules that redistribute income upward.

Fuller, 02.07.2011Former CIA station chief in Kabul; Author \u0027The Future of Political Islam\u0027America cannot go on riding the tiger forever in the Middle East. We cannot expect to have \"pro-American\" forces in power in the Middle East when the publics don\u0027t like our policies. We cannot continue our endless interventions.Read Post | CommentsKaty Hall, 02.07.2011Entertainment Editor, Huffington PostCianfrance accelerated the relationship\u0027s corrosion by starting off-screen fights between his actors.
