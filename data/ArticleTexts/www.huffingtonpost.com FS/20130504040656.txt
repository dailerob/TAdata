{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Doug BandowSenior Fellow, the Cato InstituteThe Syrian civil war lurches on, adding new casualties every day. The campaign to push the U.S. into the Syrian civil war also marches on, threatening to add American casualties to the human toll. Possible use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government is another reason to stay out, not to get in. Washington\u0027s foreign policy should be one of peace. There are tragic times when war becomes necessary, but thankfully not often. Especially for America, which enjoys a privileged international position. Today the U.S. is without peer. Terrorism is the most serious security threat facing the country, but it is only exacerbated by promiscuous intervention in conflicts not America\u0027s own. Bombing, invading, and occupying other nations creates enemies who want to hurt Americans.Comments (159)Rita F. PiersonEducational trainer, motivational speaker, authorIn the spring of my career, I found myself questioning the choice of my life\u0027s work. The students did not appear to be motivated, the paperwork was overwhelming and the constant change of educational direction was discouraging. But, I just could not seem bring myself to do anything else.Comments (86)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistBefore Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie, Julie Andrews in Victor Victoria and Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis in Some Like It Hot -- throughout history and in almost every culture -- disguising one\u0027s gender has been a common plotline in folklore, literature and theater.Comments (14)Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOAs new graduates leave college and enter the labor force, they may wish to consider the advice that I was incredibly lucky to receive from my father as a child. Be serious and disciplined in pursuing more than the what, when and why. Also be curious, and think deeply about the how.CommentsMarian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundCongress can move very quickly when it wants to and when their own comfort and that of constituents well-off enough to fly was affected. Poor three-year-olds denied early child development services may not be able to call Congress, but we need to speak out for them to stop those cuts too.CommentsArianna HuffingtonOur culture is obsessed with time. This is our real deficit crisis, and one that, unlike the more commonly discussed deficit, is actually getting worse. In fact, researchers have given this crisis a name: \"time famine.\"Comments (158)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorPayrolls increased by 165,000 last month and the unemployment rate ticked down to 7.5 percent, in a jobs report that painted a considerably brighter picture than last month\u0027s version.Comments (135)Caren Osten Gerszbergfreelance writer and co-editor, Drinking DiariesCleaning out my mother\u0027s house has been both painful and eye-opening. Her photos, keepsakes and written words remind me of the amazing woman she once was, and highlight the glaring contrast between her then and now.Comments (20)Margaret ChoComedian, actor and recording artistI got in Twitter fights for outing someone. But if public figures came out of the closet, then the LGBT kids who saw them on TV would feel safe, before they even knew why they felt dangerous. Maybe if enough people came out of the closet, gay kids would never feel dangerous.Comments (63)John PavleyCTO @ The Huffington Post, BloggerToday, the Huffington Post community posted its 250 millionth comment. The conversation is not only alive and well on HuffPost.com but thriving on HuffPost Live, on our international editions and on our iPhone, iPad, and Android applications.Comments (84)Jeffrey YoungHuffington Post Health Care ReporterAmid all the political posturing over the Medicaid expansion that\u0027s part of President Barack Obama\u0027s health care reform plan, it can be easy to lose sight of what\u0027s at stake here for a vulnerable portion of the U.S. population.CommentsShelley EmlingEditor, Post 50There\u0027s no shortage of words in the English language that are consistently mispronounced. Here are just four of them.Comments (1,410)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; host, \u0027The Breakdown\u0027; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureBehind these two disasters is a common thread of greed -- and a common need for unionized resistance. Without unions we\u0027ll remain locked in a global race toward the bottom on wages, benefits, and even the sanctity of our own lives.Comments (21)Monique RuffinAuthor, activist, life coach and motherThere is one universal experience that each one of us on the planet shares -- each one of us was borne of a woman. While it\u0027s so obvious that it\u0027s almost not worth saying, after having my own son after 17 hours of labor, this fact came to my mind in a very profound light.CommentsLarry StraussVeteran high school English teacher, basketball coach, novelistHe was the only openly gay student I\u0027d ever taught, and I admired him for having the courage to stand up to a pretty homophobic culture in South L.A., but otherwise he made no impression on me. He seemed, not surprisingly, content to be invisible -- and I\u0027m ashamed to say that I was content to let him be.CommentsBevis LongstrethFormer SEC CommissionerTo save the planet, we need to create a global movement of ordinary people demanding action now. The people, young and old, rich and poor, must seize power over global policy by taking control away from the fossil fuel companies who now wield it.CommentsArianna HuffingtonIn this week\u0027s issue, Gerry Smith looks at one of the less savory effects of recent technological innovation: the billion-dollar black market for stolen smartphones. And Lila Shapiro considers the career of former New Jersey Governor James E. McGreevey, nearly a decade after he resigned with the admission that he was \"a gay American.\"CommentsBill Moyers and Michael WinshipFrancine and David moved from New York City to Newtown to raise a family somewhere safe. They could never have imagined that in that quiet place on a Friday morning, just days before Christmas, gunfire would take their younger son\u0027s life.Comments (35)Eric E. SterlingPresident, Criminal Justice Policy FoundationIt seems everyone who knew them characterized their embrace of pot smoking as evidence of their integration into the norms of American student life in high school, college and young adult communities -- even if they sometimes were obnoxious neighbors throwing loud, drunken parties.Comments (13)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027If there was ever a time for our leaders in Washington to declare victory over the deficit, and focus instead on jobs and inequality, it\u0027s now. But don\u0027t hold your breath.Comments (240)Sir Ken RobinsonConsultant; Author, \u0027The Element: How Finding Your Passion Changes Everything\u0027In the ten years since the launch of No Child Left Behind, these efforts have intensified. The results have been unimpressive. Graduation rates continue to falter and students and teachers alike are becoming more disaffected. So what\u0027s the real problem here?Comments (16)William BradleyPolitical Analyst, NewWestNotes.comPerhaps Obama should be more careful about what he calls a \"red line.\" Dictators are not impressed by empty threats. Would there be support for a multi-national effort to secure chemical weapons stores?CommentsLeonard MaltinFilm critic and historianI have nothing against Iron Man 3, which happens to be a very entertaining film, but I like variety in my movie diet, which is why I\u0027m happy to recommend some smaller pictures that are now making their way across the country.CommentsAli A. RizviPakistani-Canadian writer, physician and musicianMuslims have rightly complained about the Israeli government labeling them anti-Semitic for legitimate criticism of Israeli policy, but today Muslims (along with liberal apologist allies) are doing the same thing with their broad use of the \"Islamophobia\" label against the \"new atheists.\"CommentsJim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027This week marked six months since Superstorm Sandy left entire communities devastated, families homeless, and many with little hope. But in the midst of this natural disaster, many banded together. One young filmmaker in New York, Farihah Zaman, caught that resilience and acts of service on video.CommentsMelinda GatesCo-chair, the Bill and Melinda Gates FoundationEmpowered, mobilized communities don\u0027t just address one single issue, such as female genital cutting; they work steadily to recognize and then meet all their needs.CommentsMike LuxCo-Founder, Democracy PartnersThe ghosts of the Enron Corporation are haunting us still, and they are a lot scarier than any horror movie ghosts because, unlike the Hollywood variety, these ghosts still have enough substance to cause an economic nightmare.CommentsBrandon StantonFounder, Humans of New YorkWhen I arrived in New York in August 2010 I\u0027d never been there before. I vividly remember looking out the window as my bus emerged from the Lincoln Tunnel, and looking down on all the sidewalks. I\u0027d never seen anything like it.CommentsDan TreadwayAssociate blog editor, The Huffington PostThis isn\u0027t even a borderline case, guys. Given our long history of mistreatment of Native Americans naming a team with any reference to that culture is a ballsy proposition. But to not only do that, but to make the name a straight-up derogatory slur, is just completely absurd.Comments (17)Carol J. CarterAuthor and student success expertWhen we think back on the most influential teacher-student relationships, it might very well be with the charismatic, welcoming, and dedicated teacher that Rita Pierson is. However, my biggest academic influence was less traditional.CommentsRalph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorThe United States Postal Service is in a freefall due to poor management, a starkly shortsighted, paralyzed Congressional leadership, and the steady march of right wing ideologues.Comments (120)Sanjay Surana, 2013. 3.05Bob Schulman, 2013. 3.05William B.
