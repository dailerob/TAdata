{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"From chronicle.augusta.comAPFrom radgraphics.netMy favorite trivial news item of the week was word that Condi Rice had ordered the removal of Penthouse and Playboy from State Department newsstands (shades of Ashcroft and his $8,000 breast-hiding curtain?). Two questions: 1) What were they doing there in the first place (although Foggy Bottom does sound like a skin mag for ass-men with cataracts)? 2) Shouldn\u0027t she be spending her time on more important matters -- like, oh I don\u0027t know, civil war in Iraq? The week\u0027s top not-at-all-trivial news items were, of course, Libby\u0027s Bush-approved leaks (here are my takes) and DeLay\u0027s resignation announcement. Nailing posts on the Hammer were Margaret Carlson, Micah Sifry, Cenk Uygur, Greg Saunders, Bill Press, Steve Benen, and Rachel Sklar (and here\u0027s mine).READ POST | comments04.05.2006 Harry ShearerSee just how grateful Chris Matthews was for getting the Tom DeLay scoop.READ POST | comments (424)04.05.2006 Al Franken\"It was fascinating being here for the demonstrations this weekend,\" Ann said. \"I guess that\u0027s why I didn\u0027t get clean towels in my hotel room this morning.\"READ POST | comments (149)04.05.2006 John KerryWe are now in the third war in Iraq in as many years.
