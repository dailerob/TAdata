{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressSenior Politics Editor, The Huffington PostAs Michael Calderone noted earlier this week, one of the more astounding things that has happened in the wake of the sectarian deterioration and renewed violence in Iraq is that the people whose actions led to these natural, predictable consequences have been reinvited onto your televisions and op-ed pages to offer their opinions as to what needs to be done. You know, as opposed to offering profuse apologies and the promise of penance. As Calderone notes, there have been instances of modest pushback, but considering that these people compose one of the biggest gangs of galactic failures to ever draw breath, they deserve to be treated, by the media, with at least a soupçon of skepticism -- if not outright scorn.Are you sharing more than you mean to online? Computer scientist Jennifer Golbeck explains how the simple act of \"liking\" something on social media reveals more personal information about you than you\u0027d think. Is this what privacy looks like in the digital age - or is there another way?\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"It is an established, and pretty boring, routine by most candidates of both parties, but especially on the right, to run against \"Washington.\" That is, even when one\u0027s own party is running \"Washington.\"United States Senator (Ret.)Why is our nation saturated with guns-- four million in military and law enforcement hands and 310 million in civilian hands? Why are American children and teens 17 times more likely to die from gun violence than their peers in 25 other high-income countries combined?President, Children\u0027s Defense FundThis civil war in Iraq is a war caused by our invasion and nearly decade long occupation, no doubt, but it is a war that will only worsen if the United States once again returns and takes a side. As with so many modern wars, a solution lies not in killing, but in compromise.Senior Fellow, Center for International Policy; Senior Advisor, Win Without War; MatthewHoh.comWorkaholism is more than a dedication to your job. It\u0027s a near-obsessive commitment that supersedes most, if not all, other aspects of life. For many, workaholism is a true addiction, inextricably tied to feelings of self worth and identity.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarThe whole mystery surrounding what he had been doing up there in the woods has been a distraction from the much more interesting mystery surrounding the man and his work: What does his writing provoke in us? How does it achieve its effect, and why?AuthorTo all the people who are on a first-name basis with the office cleaning crew, are unfazed by empty parking lots on dark nights and can\u0027t go more than 20 minutes without checking an email, this one\u0027s for you.Editor, AdoreColour.comAcross the country, consumers are demanding the right to know what is in their food, and labeling of genetically engineered food. It\u0027s a vibrant and diverse coalition: mothers and grandmothers, health libertarians, progressives, foodies, environmentalists, main street conservatives and supporters of free-market economics.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorIn the end it was an extraordinary night if not an extraordinary performance. But Chappelle will undoubtedly get there -- and \"getting there\" for Chappelle is on a talent level far exceeding the vast majority of comics today.Associate professor of political science at Lehigh UniversityWe\u0027re teaching them to be human, after all -- flawed and still fabulous. Messy and still magnificent. Weird and still wonderful, and always deeply, deeply worthy of love.Writer, humorist at the Five Kids Is A Lot of Kids blogPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideRegardless of whether we can agree that President Obama does not have the authority to bomb Iraq or Syria in a legal sense, as a political matter he should come to Congress for authorization anyway.Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicyNo amount of recognition (which I didn\u0027t get) or dangled promotion (which I also didn\u0027t get) could have made up for what I lost. They could not have compensated for those intrusions -- intrusions into my time, my space, my family, and my life.Certified Health Coach, former Fortune 500 executive, speaker, breast cancer survivor, and Founder of Lily Pad WellnessHere\u0027s a bold statement: Giving your children the chance to watch classic films can be just as vital as anything they learn in school.Editor, bestmoviesbyfarr.comSure, they seem like clean beings at home. They shower daily, wash their faces and brush their teeth... but until their camp counselors actually physically force them into the shower, they will not shower. Just assume a few good swims in the lake will suffice.Blogger, Writer, MomThe fact that some have taken to twitter to make anti-Semitic and anti-Israel remarks in the wake of the Met\u0027s announcement shows how this opera still has the potential to bring out manifestations of anti-Semitic and anti-Israel attitudes.National Director, Anti-Defamation LeagueListed here is a roadmap of high priority policies across all sectors of society for achieving an America without HIV/AIDS for women.Public Health Editor, The Huffington Post; Former U.S. Assistant Surgeon GeneralGolbeck succumbs to a dangerous, self-fulfilling fatalism, one all too common among other well-meaning proponents of her alternative solution -- namely, to simply arm individual users with more digital tools to fight back.Philosopher, Santa Clara UniversityIt\u0027s one thing to bring back souvenirs so terrible that they land you on your friend\u0027s @#$% list, and quite another to tote home tchotchkes from overseas that send you straight to jail.Everything worth caring about in food, drink, and travelNot only are Syrian girls as young as 15 with refugee status being sold into marriage, the marriages are effectively shams and more apparently, sexual servitude -- whereby the wealthy husband divorces his wife after a few days.Researcher, Walk Free FoundationThe exercise literally saved my life when I felt like I had none left. The exercise became a necessity and a driving force beyond loss. I also started the project of living my late husbands bucket list, as a way to honor my past will living a full, fit, and exciting future.Founder/CEO 1FW TrainingIt is always said that Iraq sits on a sea of oil. But it also sits on many mass graves. For a people who have been abused by each other for so many years, the best solution is to go their separate ways. Iraq has gone beyond the point of keeping Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds under one roof.Editor-in-chief of Rudaw EnglishPsychological scientists are very interested in \"chronotypes\" -- a jargony label for early birds and night owls. Now, it appears, our sleep and waking habits may actually shape our character, influencing our very judgments of right and wrong.Author, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027There will undoubtedly be serious disruptions if a major for-profit college with tens of thousands of students collapses. But the last thing government should be doing is to spend more taxpayer dollars to drive more students into bad deals at predatory colleges.Attorney, advocate, writer at RepublicReport.orgMost of us simply find it too tiring, too complex, to pay much attention to all the privacy settings out there. How many of us, for example, actually change the password settings when we are supposed to? We assume, naively, that there must be some kind of law out there that keeps corporations from going too far with all that data they are collecting on us.Innovation blogger, The Washington Post and Big ThinkYou might think: Oh, what a marvelous time you NY\u0027ers get to have in the summer. Taking your overpriced, fabulous lives out in the open, nibbling on some bruschetta and popping open bottles of expensive champagne, at noon, in SoHo.But here\u0027s what it really looks like.Author (All My Friends are Engaged) \u0026 Blogger (The Things I Learned From)The level of U.S. political rancor has reached an intensity not seen since the \u002760s with its battles over civil rights and the Vietnam War. On the one hand, we have Republicans advocating a new Iraq war and more tax breaks for the rich. On the other hand, we have Democrats saying no to war and standing up for working families.Berkeley writer, retired Silicon Valley executiveSober people can make drinkers feel uncomfortable, and sometimes they chime in with the most unusual comments. Drinkers, consider these next time you\u0027re around a Sober Sally.Social Media Manager and BloggerIf something is wrong in one part of our life, it will consume our thoughts. We are good at hiding this and being productive regardless, but it\u0027s still there, nibbling at the back of our minds until we can get home, collapse on the couch and give it our full attention.Journalist, blogger, rugby player and college student, while maintaining sobriety.USA Today splashed across its June 18, 2014, front page the breathless headline, \"Unfit for Flight\" to dramatize the deadly enterprise of flying general aviation aircraft (small airplanes). There is only one problem: Nearly every inference about aviation in the article is wrong.Scientist and former White House Senior Policy Analyst; Ph.D. in marine biology/neurophysiologyGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"W.H.
