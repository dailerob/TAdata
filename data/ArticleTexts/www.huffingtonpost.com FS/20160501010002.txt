The agreement is vulnerable, because it is subject to the vagaries of political will, and to changes in administration. President Obama has, to date, been more committed to combating climate change than any other U.S. president in recent history, and he is a key supporter of the agreement.

Rather, it\u0027s about transforming vegetables into things they are not -- like steak, carpaccio, chips and pasta. Eating healthy (and hipster) has never been so much fun.Chef, Recipe Developer and Busy MomRight now, Bernie Sanders is the man of the hour.
