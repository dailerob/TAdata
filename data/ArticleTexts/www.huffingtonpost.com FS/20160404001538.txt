{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week the nation got to experience March Madness a few days early with Donald Trump\u0027s back-to-back town halls. On Tuesday, Trump said he supports nuclear non-proliferation but also suggested that South Korea and Japan get nuclear weapons of their own (the latter has a pretty good rationale for being nuclear-free). The next night, when asked if women who have abortions should be punished, he replied, \"there has to be some form of punishment.\" And no, this wasn\u0027t an early April Fool\u0027s joke. He walked back the statement the next day, but perhaps this is the reason why three-quarters of women view him unfavorably. But as extreme as the statement was, it\u0027s worth noting that mainstream Republican policy has been punishing women seeking abortions for years at the state level - putting up unnecessary roadblocks, mandating outdated procedures and making life as miserable as possible for vulnerable women. Madness indeed.You\u0027ve got to accept that you are a woman in a man\u0027s world. And then, you\u0027ve got to work harder and longer hours and dedicate yourself to being the best at what you\u0027re doing. You can\u0027t look back; you can\u0027t look forward. You\u0027ve got to live every day and plan for tomorrow.Singer/songwriter, actress, producer and designerI\u0027m praying still for Bernie Sanders, because he\u0027s the only one willing, at least in the name of fiscal sanity, to cut back on our foreign interventions, bring the troops home, and with these trillions of dollars no longer wasted on malice, try to protect the \"homeland\" by actually rebuilding it and putting money into its people, schools, and infrastructure.Award-winning filmmakerNo matter who we are, we share a common need for sleep. Though this need has been a constant throughout human history, our relationship to sleep, and our understanding of its vital benefits, has gone through dramatic ups and downs.Britain has now joined Mexico and France in taxing businesses when they compromise the health of our children. I don\u0027t believe it\u0027s anti-business. In the UK, kids and teenagers\u0027 single largest source of sugar is from sugary sweetened drinks and with one-third of kids overweight or obese, these statistics cannot be taken lightly anymore.Celebrity Chef and Food ActivistEducation is in crisis because of the calculated effort to turn it into a business with a bottom line. Schools are closed and opened as though they were chain stores, not community institutions. Teachers are fired based on flawed measures. Disruption is considered a strategy rather than misguided and inhumane policy.Research Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027The major national media are interested mainly in personalities and in the money behind the personalities. Political reporting is dominated by stories about the quirks and foibles of the candidates, and about the people and resources behind them.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027When some autism parents who are at their wits end dare to doubt, question or voice their concerns and desire for more conversations and research about potential effects of environmental triggers -- including inoculations, GMOs, pesticides and other things -- it can be met with cruel indifference and mean-spirited name calling.Actress, author and activistIf any other industry took such drastic steps to hide obvious risks from its products, would they find such ready defenders in the editorial pages of Rupert Murdoch\u0027s Wall Street Journal?Director of Penn State Earth System Science Center; Author of \u0027Dire Predictions\u0027 and \u0027The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars\u0027We must act upon his warnings if our children, nation\u0027s future and founding principles -- subverted and still sullied by the legacies of slavery, Native American genocide, exclusion of women and non-propertied men of all colors from our electoral processes -- are to be saved.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundAs we see it, three urgent questions face America, and if the next president, Congress and the American people themselves do not answer those questions honestly and realistically, the future for our children and the nation will be immensely more difficult.Author, “Of Grunge and Government”; Chairman of FairVoteFormer Republican member of Congress from South Carolina and co-chair of 3 American QuestionsFormer Democratic member of Congress from Washington State and co-chair of 3 American QuestionsWhat\u0027s being done about keeping the world\u0027s deadliest materials out of the hands of terrorists? A lot. But progress is slowing, and the fourth Nuclear Security Summit in March may be the last chance to create a path to an effective global security system that will protect us all.President and Chief Operating Officer of the Nuclear Threat InitiativeI want to express my anger at the shameful images that have circulated widely on the Web (though for once not widely enough) of a manhandled journalist, her glasses ripped off, dragged away by police, veritably kidnapped, and stashed in a jail that in principle is reserved for the dregs of humanity.French philosopher and writerTeacher diversity is an educational civil right for our students. The research is clear that a diverse teaching force is essential to ensuring high-quality education for all students, and especially for students of color.President, American Federation of TeachersForty eight years ago, the Republican Convention, held in Miami, changed the American political scene, perhaps forever. The forthcoming Republican Convention in Cleveland may well do the same.Former Republican CongressmanFeeling sick? They\u0027ll bring you soup. It\u0027s your birthday? They\u0027ll buy you flowers.Wife, mother, and professor. Usually exhausted.Maybe it takes one to know one. Maybe the fact that I have lost three times on a national scale has given me a special insight. But I can assure you, I know one when I see one, and you, Donald Trump, are a loser.Democratic candidate for U.S. Representative of North Carolina\u0027s 2nd Congressional DistrictDonald Trump landed in Wisconsin Tuesday, turning out a huge crowd in Janesville. With dozens of vendors hawking goods, there was a carnival-like atmosphere to the event unlike any other. Trump ditched the standard stump speech for a withering attack on Wisconsin\u0027s conservative establishment.The Center for Media and Democracy/ALEC ExposedFascism is back. Not just as a political expletive thrown at opponents. But as a doctrine, as a movement, and -- above all -- as a set of feelings. It has been easy to view fascism as a freak historical phenomenon of the inter-war period that was embodied by Mussolini, Hitler, Franco and one or two other minor characters.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghWhile cis people just naturally look at one of two of their options and walk into a bathroom without a second thought, for trans people, choosing a restroom is like deciding if you want to risk the chance of being harassed or physically assaulted.Youtuber, Animator, and IllustratorIn this one world, it sometimes seems a race is on between the newly empowered and the recently dispossessed. The truth is not only that both realities exist simultaneously, but that one is a condition of the other.Editor-in-chief, THEWORLDPOSTIn Sweden, where I was born, all that\u0027s needed to travel is a Google search for hotel deals and a few clicks to book a flight. Yet in the Gaza Strip, where my parents were born and I live now, being able to travel is akin to achieving a miracle.Research assistant at Human Rights WatchSaying that the Qur\u0027an is the real culprit of Belgian terror attacks would be the same as saying that the Bible is the real culprit behind the Spanish Inquisition. Both of these statements are false.Lawyer, writer, and self proclaimed Mortal Kombat ChampionEarlier this month, two high-profile men in the tennis world tried to set back women players a few decades. In any context, their misogynist comments are offensive. But they are particularly troublesome because tennis is a sport which has been uniquely progressive on gender equality.Blogs Editor, Huffington PostFor both the Democrats and Republicans, Wisconsin will be a pivotal day. As we pass the halfway point, both party frontrunners are struggling to sustain their advantage, both are vulnerable.President, Fiscal Strategies GroupWhether there are 8 or 800 -- with bright double-ball elastic holders tight at the top and butterfly barrettes bouncing at the bottom or with cobalt blue yarn woven throughout -- braids are, and always will be, a definitive symbol of black girl culture.Image activist, writer and creator of MAD FREEThe Democratic Party\u0027s special class of entitled and unelected VIP delegates helps explain what\u0027s wrong with the way we choose our presidential candidates.Senior writer, BillMoyers.com. Former senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.My favorite pictures of my little girls are when I accidentally take one of them laughing together in between the \"say cheese!\" photographs I was trying for. My favorite ones of myself, however, are ones where I look my best.
