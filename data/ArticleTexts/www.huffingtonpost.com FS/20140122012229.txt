{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonGreetings from Davos. I\u0027m here for the 44th annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, where the theme is \"The Reshaping of the World: Consequences for Society, Politics and Business,\" and we\u0027ve chosen this moment to launch The WorldPost, in partnership with the Berggruen Institute on Governance, as a hub for everything from political and economic news to discussions of the cultural and artistic forces shaping and reshaping our increasingly global collective imagination. It\u0027s a moment that represents the culmination of more than a year of conversations between Nicolas Berggruen, our editor-in-chief Nathan Gardels, executive editor Peter Goodman and me about the need for a global platform that can bring together a mix of perspectives, from world leaders to young people whose voices might otherwise go unheard, original reporting and a platform built for engagement and conversation.CommentsRobert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027If we assume that he either instigated the lane closures himself or was kept fully informed of the scheme, then Christie doubled down with an even bigger risk when he solemnly denied knowledge or involvement. If he knew all along, Christie compounded a major blunder with an outright lie.Comments (190)The B TeamNot-for-profit prioritizing people and planet alongside profitWith the UN Climate Change negotiations underway, and as the United Nations designs its flagship Sustainable Development Goals in 2015, business needs to engage.CommentsAnne-Marie SlaughterPresident and CEO, The New American FoundationReports, panel discussions and media reports still focus overwhelmingly on measuring the participation of women in what has traditionally been the world of men. But it is equally important to measure the participation of men in what has traditionally been the world of women.Comments (30)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027The provisions in the agreement will overrule measures passed by national, state, and local legislative bodies, in effect stripping democratically elected officials of much of their authority. Since most of the text is still secret we can only speculate on what the final agreement will include.Comments (83)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action Networke simply cannot celebrate Dr. King, then turn around and watch efforts to dismantle the very things he fought and died for. Here we are recognizing such an esteemed figure and a national holiday, yet the Supreme Court recently gutted part of the Voting Rights Act itself.CommentsJillian BermanAssociate Business Editor, The Huffington PostEven armed with the knowledge that the conversation was probably going to go my way and the feeling that I did deserve more, I had a tough time getting the words out of my mouth. After the talk ended, I was relieved, but not completely.CommentsNicholas MirielloSenior/International Blog Editor, The Huffington PostSherman, in his brash, egotistical mini-monologue is neither a hero nor a villain. He\u0027s a human being, something the NFL has brilliantly excised from its product.Comments (23)Boria SaxAuthor, \u0027Imaginary Animals,\u0027 The Mythical Zoo,\u0027 \u0027Animals in the Third Reich\u0027What does the future hold for dogs in the West? Perhaps, if the integration into human society continues, we could come to regard them as almost fully \"human,\" with the rights and responsibilities that entails.CommentsAlan SingerSocial studies educator, Hofstra UniversityAn examination of the Pearson publishing mega-giant\u0027s plan to control public education in Great Britain makes clear, the greatest threat to local initiatives in public education may be from powerful global corporations.CommentsMartha BurkMoney Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsJanuary 22 is the 41st anniversary of the landmark Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision. Roe was supposed to put an end to the fight over access to a life-saving procedure. Far from it.Comments (113)Chris CarberryExecutive Director and co-founder, Explore MarsIf we can achieve Mars without a major increase in budget, it would be fiscally irresponsible not to commit. We have made a long-term investment in space. Let\u0027s make the most effective use of taxpayer and private dollars and accomplish something bold and inspiring for the nation and the world.Comments (38)David M. KennedyDirector, Center for Crime Prevention and Control, John Jay College of Criminal JusticeHomicide may be down nationally, but until we reach the corners of America that still suffer from daily violence, and where getting stopped, arrested, and locked up are a normal part of a young man\u0027s life, we are doing them an injustice.Comments (11)Bernard-Henri LévyFrench philosopher and writerUNESCO has long had on its schedule an exhibit titled \"People, Book, Land: The 3,500-Year Relationship of the Jewish People with the Holy Land.\" The content of the exhibit had been approved by archaeological experts and met all pertinent scientific criteria. But less than a week from its opening, the exhibit was suddenly put on hold.CommentsTom EngelhardtEditor, TomDispatch.comIn terms of journalism, of expression, of voice, of fine reporting and superb writing, of a range of news, thoughts, views, perspectives, and opinions about places, worlds, and phenomena that I wouldn\u0027t otherwise have known about, there has never been an experimental moment like this. I\u0027m in awe.CommentsRobert ScheerEditor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027Barack Obama\u0027s speech Friday on surveillance was his worst performance, not as a matter of theatrical skill, though he clearly did not embrace his lines, but in its stark betrayal of his oft proclaimed respect for constitutional safeguards and civil liberty.Comments (85)Wendell PotterAuthor, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgKnowing I\u0027ve been both a critic of insurance company practices and a supporter of efforts to reform the industry, a FOX news producer reached out last week to get my take on accusations by conservatives that Obamacare will actually result in a bailout of big insurance companies.Comments (131)Rep. Alan GraysonU.S. Congressman for Florida\u0027s 9th DistrictA picture is worth 1000 words. So let me show you two of them. On the left, our trade balance between 1962 and 1992, before so-called \"free trade agreements.\" And on the right, our trade balance since then.CommentsBill MoyersManaging Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyWhile astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson believes all individuals have a right to their own beliefs, he\u0027s passionate about what should be taught in science class -- science.CommentsJudge H. Lee SarokinRetired federal judgeThe tension between security and liberty will increase as the years go on with each new attack or attempt. The country may debate whether or not Edward Snowden is a traitor or a patriot, but he has done something invaluable for the nation.Comments (19)Morris W. O\u0027KellyHost of \"The Mo\u0027Kelly Show\" on KFI AM640/XM Satellite Radio and \"Mo\u0027Kelly in the Morning\" on KTLK AM1150I get it, Christie isn\u0027t Republican-sexy enough. But he\u0027s your best player. We\u0027ve been over the math and Ronald Reagan isn\u0027t walking through that door. And if he did you\u0027d probably call him a RINO too for compromising with Tip O\u0027Neill.CommentsRandi WeingartenPresident, American Federation of TeachersDespite herculean efforts by many Democrats, Congress has allowed unemployment assistance to expire for 1 million out-of-work Americans, and has thwarted efforts to raise the minimum wage and slashed food stamps. Rather than a war on poverty, it feels like a war on the poor.Comments (19)Richard (RJ) EskowSenior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host, Take Action NewsWall Street bankers made extraordinary sums of money through fraud, without being held accountable for the crimes that enriched them. Their values are polluted and their ethics are tainted. Justice has yet to be served, and the public has yet be adequately protected through regulation and oversight.CommentsTony NewmanDirector of Media Relations, Drug Policy AllianceWhat has been shocking until now is that politicians have been so far behind the American public when it comes to the drug war. But there\u0027s reason for hope.CommentsBarbara LeePresident, Barbara Lee Political Office and Barbara Lee Family FoundationWe know women have to jump through hoops to do well at the polls -- be qualified, likable, warm, strong, competent, compassionate, polished but not too pretty -- and the list goes on. Time and again, we see women up for the challenge.CommentsDon TapscottAdvisor to government and business leaders; Author, \u0027Macrowikinomics\u0027I\u0027m often asked what the Forum is like, and what is its real meaning in terms of improving the state of the world? The Forum began as a meeting for European executives to discuss global problems. It evolved into a think tank. Today you could think of the organization as a \"do tank.\"CommentsJon EigLecturer in Screenwriting and Film History, Montgomery CollegeIf I\u0027m choosing between two movies and both are entertaining and informative, but one is clearly out to change the world, I do find myself favoring the world-changer. That comes into play this year for me, though it may not for you.CommentsMark CubanOwner, Dallas Mavericks; Chairman, AXS TVI bet you think the mobile Internet is open. That if you write the next great mobile app there is nothing that can stop it from fulfilling its destiny. That if you create a mobile content app that blows away Netflix there is nothing that can stop it. Wrong.Comments (19)Judith A. SalernoPresident and CEO, Susan G. KomenMaria Shriver\u0027s report this past week on the economic crisis plaguing American women reinforces what those of us who work with vulnerable women see every day.CommentsNoah MichelsonEditor, HuffPost Gay VoicesLove is action. Love is terrifying. And when we speak out, when we open up our mouths and say, \"No more. I am not a sin. I am not a mistake...,\" we are engaged in that kind of love.Comments (59)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activist\"Life\u0027s most persistent and urgent question is, \u0027What are you doing for others?\u0027\" When the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King spoke those words from the pulpit of a Baptist church in 1957, he reminded us of the greatest hallmark of our American democracy: that we are here to lift each other up.CommentsDan Kennedy, 2014.21.01Morris W. O\u0027Kelly, 2014.21.01Gregory T. Angelo, 2014.21.01Kathy Ko Chin, 2014.21.01Peter Neill, 2014.21.01Mary Manning Cleveland, 2014.21.01Marjorie Hansen Shaevitz, 2014.21.01Dirk Adams, 2014.21.01Rob Schware, 2014.21.01Dan Solin, 2014.21.01Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"FEDERAL CHARGES FOR GOV.
