{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Global Editorial DirectorDemocrats like to brag that they have been in continuous operation for two centuries, longer than any other major political party in the free world. It certainly feels like it. With the possible (perhaps even likely) entry of Vice President Joe Biden, 72, the contest will become an old-fashioned tale of palace intrigue, as he and Hillary Rodham Clinton maneuver for the favor and endorsement of the president. And a three-way race with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) would feature the three sub-brands that have dominated and defined the Democratic Party on campus and in the country since the 1960s.Political strategists still debate whether Biden forced President Obama to move more quickly on marriage equality, or if he was part of a trial, balloon days before the president finally announced support in the spring of 2012. But the bottom line is, Biden was first, ahead of Obama and Hillary Clinton -- who was last out of the gate among the three.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostHe kept mumbling the same thing over and over again. I leaned in further to hear him more clearly, \"forever and ever, forever and ever, forever and ever...\"Campaigns and Communications Manager for LGBT Progress, Center for American ProgressAs Labor Day looms, more Americans than ever don\u0027t know how much they\u0027ll be earning next week or even tomorrow.

There\u0027s been no sign of a turnaround. For that to happen, there would have to be a massive commitment of funds to job training and education programs and greater tax incentives for businesses to hire the poor.Author and political analystIn the first half of this year, at least six domestic coal companies filed for bankruptcy.

We wanted to find out what would happen if we stopped labeling our dogs. It\u0027s up to us, as advocates for shelter dogs, to start explaining to people that breed labels are subjective. The way a dog looks says nothing reliable about their behavior.Kristen is the Deputy Chief Animal Services Officer at Austin Animal Services in Austin, Texas.Reading the paper is all too often a jarring experience, but it was especially so on Monday. It\u0027s impossible to ignore the disconnect between the well-deserved recognition of Julian Bond\u0027s life, and the stark evidence that we have so far to go in order to secure the ideals he championed.Founder, People for the American WayIt\u0027s been a chaotic few days for the world\u0027s markets. Recent events do not paint the picture of a stable economy guided by rational minds. Like other nations, we have a central bank. What should the Federal Reserve do in troubled times? For that matter, what is the Fed\u0027s role in preventing them from occurring in the first place?WriterMost professors in this situation would have patted themselves on the back for having managed to get the article back online and then turned their attention back to their usual work of teaching and scholarship. But Dreger has made a career out of defending academic freedom.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoIt\u0027s not about \"political correctness\" (in the context of current Mississippi politics, supporting the inclusion of the Rebel standard on the state flag is the politically \"correct\" thing to do). It\u0027s about moral correctness; it\u0027s about historical correctness; it\u0027s about common decency.HistorianGov. Kasich thinks the problem with teachers is the teachers\u0027 lounge. The problem with teachers is this: We are having to deal with laws that are being passed by people who have not one single clue as to what our job entails. Go ahead, good sir! Get rid of the teachers\u0027 lounge. We probably won\u0027t even notice. We\u0027re too busy doing our job.Blogs at accidentaldevotional.com.

Certainly, there will be occasions when we have to strike these individuals before they strike us. But I continue to believe strongly that diplomacy must always be given a chance. And even if it fails, it is a prerequisite to gaining the support of others and the effective use of force.Distinguished Scholar, Indiana UniversityDon\u0027t get us wrong, we\u0027re all for the \"If it ain\u0027t broke, don\u0027t\u0027 fix it\" mentality when it comes to a family recipe or your tried-and-true makeup routine. But having the same orgasm every time can be repetitive.Prevention provides service journalism at its best: news, perspective-shifting features and practical strategies to enhance lives.It is important that the public have a clear idea of what is at stake in the Fed\u0027s decisions on interest rates. While many politicians and policy experts are grappling with ways to try to lower the poverty rate, the Fed will be directly preventing people from seeing pay increases.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Writer, comedian and creator of TheCooperReview.comCarly Fiorina recognizes the danger that a technology-dominated classroom -- a classroom focused on programmable skills rather than on messy and ever-changing ideas -- will become the location of job training rather than intellectual exploration.Davidson-Kahn Distinguished University Professor and Professor of Law at Florida International University; Floershimer Distinguished Visiting Professor of Law at Cardozo Law SchoolJoe Biden certainly has got the media talking. All it really took was one leak to Maureen Dowd and a meeting with Senator Elizabeth Warren, and he\u0027s now seriously considering it. But a Biden candidacy bears political examination beyond the simple question of \"Will he or won\u0027t he run?\"Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comGlobal investors and lenders have learned relatively little since 2008, creating more bubbles, ignoring more warning signs, and, until recently, continuing to party like it\u0027s 1999. The chickens are coming home to roost.CEO of Country Risk SolutionsAs one more year has passed and 61 awaits on the last day of August I am more solidly convinced that having a fire within is the real secret to aging well. This is the force that lifts hearts and energy levels while our bodies are heading South.Author, \u0027The Secret Lives of Wives: Women Share What It Really Takes To Stay Married\u0027The real war on religion is being waged by those on the Right who read the Bible not as the story of God\u0027s saving interaction with the world through the unfolding of God\u0027s reign, but either as foundational for a conservative politics of self-interest or as a blueprint for a post-Enlightenment cult of individual piety.Author; Editor; Speaker; ActivistISIS took advantage of the failure of the central governments to keep control of civil society in Syria and Iraq. If Lebanon\u0027s government collapses it is possible that ISIS may try to fill the vacuum in the absence of effective leadership.State Representative, MassachusettsOne of the questions I get asked in almost every interview is, \"Where did your ability to communicate with dogs come from?\"Best-selling author, public speaker, and the internationally acclaimed star of “Cesar 911\" on Nat Geo WILD.Many innocent people are sitting in prison with convictions for crimes they did not commit.

After the crippling sanctions and the shadow of a possible war with the U.S. are lifted, Iran\u0027s economy will begin to improve and Western investments will begin to flow into the country. With an improved economy and the absence of a threat to Iran\u0027s national security, democratic groups inside the country will be able to raise their voice and demand lifting of the security environment that has pervaded Iran since the Green Movement of 2009-2011.Iran News \u0026 Middle East ReportI dropped my oldest son off at college last weekend.
