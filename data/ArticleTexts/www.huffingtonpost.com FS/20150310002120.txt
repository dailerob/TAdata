{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghThe roulette wheel that is presidential politics is spinning faster now that we are only one year and eight months from election day. Bets are being placed as the main stakeholders look to their future financial and career investments. The media play to the hilt this longest running spectacle that our pop culture offers. The Very Serious People throw the rune stones and check the entrails on a daily basis so as to provide informed commentary on the state of play. Thus the world\u0027s greatest democracy and sole superpower approaches its quadrennial moment of decision in selecting who its next ruler will be. So it is time to take our bearings, to cast aside the resolution made in November 2012 never again to expend time and mental energy trying to make sense of what has become a literally senseless process. Isn\u0027t that our duty as good citizens?A clinical assistant professor of medicine at the Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine, Rubin Naiman is particularly interested in dreams. In answer to my questions, he passionately and eloquently makes the case that we can truly benefit from opening ourselves to our dreams and meeting them on their own terms rather than trying to view them through the lens of waking life.Either we lessen the dominance of big American corporations over American politics. Or we increase their allegiance and responsibility to America. It has to be one or the other. Americans can\u0027t thrive within a political system run largely by big American corporations -- organized to boost their share prices but not boost America.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027While U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is trying to negotiate the most critical elements of a deal to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons and avoid war, the Republicans are actively trying to undermine his efforts to get a deal.Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersPeople are baffled that my exterior -- a 27-year-old who used to work at Clinique and peruses Pinterest for fashion inspiration -- could reflect an interior longing for consecrated life and its seemingly antiquated vows of celibacy, poverty and obedience. Their questions have forced me to confront my self-image.College student discerning religious life, ambassador of National Catholic Sisters Week, Illinois nativeApart from inadvertently making the case for equal time by his Israeli pre-election opposition, the spectacle of Benjamin Netanyahu\u0027s wild diatribe at the joint session of Congress amidst the feral cheers of his congressional yahoos will be remembered as a textbook case of propaganda unhinged from reality.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorWe take issue of campus sexual assault very seriously (unlike some others). In the coming weeks and months of this campaign, we hope that The Hunting Ground inspires serious debate and serious discussion from journalists and policy-makers alike. We owe that much to students.Filmmaker, \"The Hunting Ground\"Filmmaker, \"The Hunting Ground\"While the data show that we are making progress in a number of important areas -- including health, education and legal protections -- it equally reveals that these gains have not been fully realized by all.Vice Chair, Clinton FoundationPolicy intellectuals -- eggheads presuming to instruct the mere mortals who actually run for office -- are a blight on the republic. Like some invasive species, they infest present-day Washington, where their presence strangles common sense and has brought to the verge of extinction the simple ability to perceive reality.Author, \u0027The Limits of Power: The End of American Exceptionalism\u0027Overall, white Americans believe that discrimination against whites (i.e., \"reverse racism\") is a more prevalent phenomenon than the racial discrimination African Americans face. That\u0027s why the Justice Department\u0027s investigation of the police department and the municipal court system in Ferguson, Missouri, is so important.Author of \u0027Obama’s America: A Transformative Vision of Our National Identity\u0027It turns out there\u0027s more than one way to make an attractive body, and those different body types evolve to be well-integrated. That\u0027s a liberating message for most of us: evolutionary biology has more to offer our understanding of diversity than the idea that only one \"most attractive\" body (or face, or personality) always wins out.Evolutionary biologist and authorIn a majority of cases, Roberts and the other conservatives have ruled against the Obama administration\u0027s position on the big ticket issues of voting rights, affirmative action, corporate and property rights, and union and environmental protections. Their assault has had little to do with the law, and everything to do with politics and ideology.Author and political analystI was a member of this chapter 14 years ago. The second Black man to be initiated in those halls. I thought we were different. Maybe I was just being hopeful. I believed in S-A-E. I believed in the True Gentlemen. I believed my brothers were my brothers. I believed my son should be their brother if he so chose one day. But then I saw that video.Associate, Gungoll Jackson, Box and Devoll, PCMultinational corporations -- including some of the planet\u0027s biggest polluters -- could use the Trans-Pacific Partnership to sue governments, in private trade tribunals, over laws and policies that they claimed would reduce their profits. The implications are that corporate profits are more important than protections for air and water, climate stability, workers\u0027 rights, and more.Executive Director, The Sierra ClubWendy Wasserstein\u0027s Pulitzer Prize Winning Play reopening on Broadway has renewed resonance on the day after International Women\u0027s Day.Culture Columnist, Huffington Post, CultureZohnYes, we crossed the bridge half a century ago, and we crossed it again in a reenactment with the president this weekend, but 50 years from now at the 100th anniversary, we will be judged not by whether we brought a Black president to the bridge.President, National Action NetworkFor most of its history, the Federal Reserve has been dominated by bankers and orthodox economists, who kill the recovery at the first sign of inflationary risks. Happily, the Fed today is led by Janet Yellen, a very uncharacteristic Fed chair who spent most of her career as a labor economist, of all things.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027While Tennessee lawmakers continue to do all they can to undermine Obamacare, low- and moderate-income Kentuckians can go to bed at night and not have the same worry that their neighbors a few miles to the south have about the cost of health care. Does that make sense to you?Author, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgDavid Brooks can\u0027t resist the old DC one-step. People who say \"education is really important, but it\u0027s not the only determinant of wage growth\" become people who disparage the importance of education.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThe gun-sense community had to know that the ATF\u0027s decision to withdraw the exemption for all uses of this ammo would be construed, rightfully, as a ban. Want to take the short odds on the ATF in this argument? I don\u0027t.Mike the Gun GuyFast-food workers and the millions of low-wage workers trapped in the margins of our economy are changing the world. Leaders in the faith community are standing with them along with tens of thousands of concerned people who believe in fairness.Executive Director of Interfaith Worker JusticeExecutive Director, NETWORK, A National Catholic Social Justice LobbyWhen he visited Washington, D.C. two years ago, Burma\u0027s new president was being hailed as an \"Asian Gorbachev.\" America\u0027s capital rolled out the podiums and cocktail receptions because it appeared a \"Burma Spring\" was underway -- or at least a winter thaw. But has the former general turned out to be the reformer everyone hoped?Former speechwriter at the U.S. Department of StateI think it\u0027s wonderful that the growing discussion about introversion and extroversion helps expand our understanding of one another. And I will try to do better. We all will.Teen and Emerging Adult Mental Health SpecialistWhat should inject constructive energy and useful ideas into the political system, producing a mandate for governing and a re-commitment to republican government, is once again on a course to disappoint us. Both parties are to blame -- and so are we.Founder, Leadership for a Responsible SocietyThese days, it has become far more difficult to teach the history of America\u0027s war in Vietnam because one of the chief lessons of that war we thought we had learned (\"No More Vietnams\") has been soundly disproven in recent years.Professor, historian, authorNow is the time for us to speak out, join together and reclaim the promise of America. That starts by educating our students about the impact of the civil rights movement, acting collectively to achieve a renewal of the Voting Rights Act and redoubling our efforts to ensure all children grow up in safe communities with high-quality neighborhood public schools.President, American Federation of TeachersLast summer, the City of Seattle passed a law that will raise the city\u0027s minimum wage to $15 per hour. But in a bizarre twist, Ronald McDonald and friends are suing the city and complaining that the new minimum wage violates a constitutional provision that was written to protect newly-freed slaves after the Civil War.Legal Director, Free Speech For PeopleFifty years after Bloody Sunday, I marched to the top of the Edmund Pettus Bridge with Mrs. Amelia Boynton Robinson, Congressman John Lewis, President Barack Obama, and many others.Professor of Law at The George Washington University Law School; Senior Fellow at DemosAll that time I said I wasn\u0027t indoctrinating anyone with my beliefs about gay and lesbian and bi and trans and queer people? That was a lie. All 25 years of my career as an LGBTQ activist, I have been on a consistent campaign of trying to change people\u0027s minds about us. I want to make them like us.Writer, educator, storyteller, \u0026 loudmouth.The reality is, to truly respond to gender-based violence, we need a holistic approach that seeks to change attitudes and social norms, ensure legal protections and train law enforcement, and provide the services necessary for survivors to seek effective recourse and heal.Policy and Government Affairs Senior Manager, Women Thrive WorldwideHillary Clinton is rumored to be putting her campaign team together, and she may announce her intention to run for president sooner rather than later. However, her handling of the controversy over her use of private emails while at the State Department has exposed one of her great weaknesses: transparency.Hofstra Journalism ProfessorGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"APPLE OF YOUR ARM",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
