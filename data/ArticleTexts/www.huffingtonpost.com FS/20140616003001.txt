Incredibly, the war\u0027s cheerleaders somehow took the turmoil as vindication that the U.S. should never have left. \"Lindsey Graham and John McCain were right,\" said McCain. But the problem isn\u0027t what we did in 2011; it\u0027s what we did in 2003. In 2014, we need to stop listening to those who have been wrong on this war again and again. Back home, Tea Party challenger Dave Brat knocked off House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. Though Brat\u0027s no-reform stance on immigration played a role in the outcome, more powerful was his anti-Wall Street message, leading Ryan Lizza to dub him \"the Elizabeth Warren of the right.\" For establishment politicians, including Hillary Clinton, it\u0027s a message they ignore at their peril.Much of the discourse has focused on the needs and potential contributions of working mothers, but Father\u0027s Day weekend is an appropriate time to celebrate fathers and remind ourselves that work-life balance isn\u0027t just a women\u0027s issue.29th Ambassador of the United States of America to JapanThe U.S. had no business invading Iraq.

To check that assumption, I did some research.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoI\u0027ve heard things in the aftermath of the election that indeed have made me sad -- not because people didn\u0027t vote for me, but because of why in many cases people said they didn\u0027t vote for me.AuthorThis is the America of the 21st century, a country divided along lines of morality, where wealth equates to power and the gap between those who have and those who don\u0027t is increasing.

Eric Cantor (R-VA) by Professor David Brat, an economist from Randolph-Macon College, in Tuesday\u0027s Republican primary has several takeaways for progressives besides envy and shame over why they do not directly take on the corporate Democrats.Consumer advocate, lawyer and author\"There are two kinds of people in the world: those who stop at a traffic accident to see if they can help, and those who just drive by.\"Award-winning actress, author and activistWhat the world is seeing in Brazil are protesters who are acting out of the impulse that built Brazil\u0027s democracy out of dictatorship, often being confronted by police whose tactics and training are holdovers from military rule.Lemann Professor of Brazilian History, University of Illinois at Urbana-ChampaignAfter too many mass vigils like the one that followed the Sandy Hook massacre, we have learned that while sympathy is well meant, it does not lead to action. Courage does.First Female Governor of Vermont; Marsh Scholar, University of VermontIf sentenced today I would face a maximum sentence of 20 years, not a living death sentence.

Father. Writer. Founder of Daddyfiles.comNot too long ago in our recent past there used to be TV shows -- entertainment, we called it -- and we also had the news.
