{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, the branches of government traded checks and balances for sticks and stones. First, President Obama fired a shot across the Supreme Court\u0027s bow, saying that to strike down his health care law would be \"an unprecedented, extraordinary step.\" Though not actually unprecedented, it would, in fact, be extraordinary -- but not as extraordinary as what came next: a Court of Appeals judge, hearing a related case, asked the Justice Department to turn in a three-page, single-spaced letter, signed by Eric Holder, explaining the executive branch\u0027s position on judicial review, a move that embarrassed even some conservative legal experts. The attorney general\u0027s response to the unusual homework assignment fell a bit short; it was only two-and-a-half pages long. Doesn\u0027t the AG know all he had to do was make his margins bigger, add a bibliography, and start off with a long quote?Read Post | Comments (95)Mohamed A. El-Erian, 04/08/12CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOAugusta will find a way to put the current controversy behind it -- and hopefully do so by changing an inappropriate rule. But the rest of us should not let this stop in Georgia. It should also influence our thinking about other, much more consequential and harmful situations.Read Post | CommentsRoma Downey, 04/06/12Producer, Author, PhilanthropistMy own kids have loved Easter and the thrill of the Easter egg hunt, but they have also learned lessons along the way.

And it\u0027s time for Obama to now kick down the closet door. It\u0027s no longer a matter of whether he can or should. He must if he wants to win the election.Read Post | Comments (674)Sarah Shourd, 04/05/12Writer, Former Hostage and Advocate for Political Prisoners in Iran, United4IranMr. Masoud Shafii did everything in his power to defend Josh\u0027s, Shane\u0027s and my innocence within the parameters of Iranian law.

Hardly an unreasonable request, given how much cash the broadcasters make from their free use of the airwaves. But the broadcasting industry\u0027s response has been a simple, declarative \"Not on your life!\" It would cost too much money, they claim.Read Post | Comments (245)Sen.

Daughters, Fathers, and the Changing American Family\u0027A gay man can grin and say ironically, \"I\u0027m a really good mother,\" which may mean that he performs the daily child care in his home, but his comment does not define him as a mom. Nor is a lesbian who coaches her son\u0027s hockey team a father. Both are just doing what parents do.Read Post | Comments (200)David Berri, 04/06/12Co-author, \u0027Stumbling on Wins\u0027; Economics professor, Southern Utah UniversityThe revenue per team in the NFL dwarfs what we see at the college ranks.
