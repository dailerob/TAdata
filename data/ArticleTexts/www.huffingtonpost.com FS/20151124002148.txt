{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"¡Hola! I\u0027m writing from Madrid, where we\u0027re in the midst of our HuffPost Global Summit. It\u0027s been a productive and inspiring few days, with senior editorial and business staff from around the world gathered to discuss the exciting road ahead for HuffPost and the next chapter of our international expansion. In just a few years, HuffPost has come a very long way -- from publishing in one language to publishing in 10, from being a U.S.-focused site to being a global distributed media company in 15 markets, nearly a third of the way toward our goal of being in 50 markets. Our international audience now exceeds our U.S. audience, with 52 percent of traffic coming from outside the U.S. -- an accomplishment that seemed incredibly ambitious when we launched our first international edition, HuffPost Canada, back in 2011.We are living in one of the most turbulent times in human history. While the world\u0027s attention is focused on small groups of people that are hell-bent on destruction and terror, I will be in Paris to honor certain small groups of people that stand for the opposite of terror. They stand for life, cooperation and the health of the planet.ActorThe fact is, people want live in cities with clean air -- and where people want to live, businesses want to invest. One way to do that is by investing in low carbon transportation infrastructure -- from bus rapid transit to bike share systems -- that help reduce congestion and improve mobility.Fmr. three-term mayor of New York City; Founder of Bloomberg Philanthropies and Bloomberg LPIn the discussions of the events now taking place on an increasing number of college campuses the phrases \"free speech\" and \"academic freedom\" are routinely invoked. Neither is an appropriate rubric for the analysis of what is happening.Davidson-Kahn Distinguished University Professor and Professor of Law at Florida International University; Floershimer Distinguished Visiting Professor of Law at Cardozo Law SchoolThere\u0027s this thing that happens whenever I speak about or write about women\u0027s issues. Things like dress codes, rape culture and sexism. I get the comments: Is this really that big of a deal? Aren\u0027t you being overly sensitive? Every. Single. Time. And every single time I get frustrated. Why don\u0027t they get it?Writer, mom, wanna-be groupie. Lover of coffee, bourbon and carbs. Blogger at DriftingThrough.comI have experienced intense racism and Islamophobia after a tragedy that is conducted by violent extremists. I have been demanded to apologize and be accountable for unspeakable crimes by people I don\u0027t know, from a violent culture I\u0027m not a part of. That is exhausting and draining.Writer and advocate focusing on Muslim women in sportsLess than 5 percent of American donation dollars went to international causes, and an even smaller fraction was allocated for effective anti-poverty relief. Unfortunately, this means that the majority of American charitable dollars never reaches the people in the developing world, those who need our help the most.Harvard researcher, teacher, passionate about effective poverty reliefFar from seeing common interests, struggling working class voters increasingly have contempt for those who need government benefits. The economic pressure on the bottom 90 percent divides them against themselves. Cue Donald Trump, Ben Carson, Ted Cruz.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Hillary Clinton\u0027s speech on ISIS to the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) showed clearly what to expect in a Clinton presidency: more of the same. In her speech, Clinton doubled down on the existing, failed U.S. approach in the Middle East, the one she pursued as Secretary of State.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia UniversityAsked on PBS NewHour whether ExxonMobil funds climate change denier organizations to malign mainstream climate science, ExxonMobil\u0027s vice president of public and government affairs replied, \"Well, the answer is yes... And I will let those organizations respond for themselves.\"Senior Writer, Union of Concerned ScientistsThe truth is I\u0027ve never participated in an orgy, and I have no actual desire to do it -- but judgy conservatives make me want to do it as a way to hold up my middle finger. It\u0027s my body and I\u0027ll get off any way I see fit.Author of American Woman: The Poll Dance, Media Director for We Are Woman2015 is not 1938. The faces of the refugees are different. The languages they speak are different. The places and killers from which and from whom they are fleeing are different as well. But the refugees\u0027 anguish and despair, their fear and sense of abandonment, are very much the same.Professor of law and son of Holocaust survivorsWe have so many things to be thankful for as Americans, and I think most folks will probably be thankful that they can turn away from the rhetoric and often mean tone of the campaign, at least for the family celebration of Thanksgiving.Former Congressman and Secretary of AgricultureWhen I first heard about this doomsday device in Stanley Kubrik\u0027s dark nuclear satire Dr. Strangelove, I wasn\u0027t sure if it was physically possible. Now, I unfortunately know better, and it seems like it Russia may be building it.MIT physicist, author of \"Our Mathematical Universe\"Could bringing back \"earmarks\" -- derided as pork barrel, insider spending just a few years ago -- be the unconventional solution for re-booting Congress? It just might be.Senior Advisor, The Beeck Center at Georgetown University\"What is honored in a country will be cultivated,\" Plato said, and this is true for spirituality within the university setting. It cannot just be talked about on the margins, spirituality must be at the heart of the campus.Executive Editor Of Global Spirituality and Religion, The Huffington PostThe Obama administration is planning to spend over $1 trillion in the next 30 years on an entire new generation of nuclear bombs, bombers, missiles and submarines to replace those built during the Reagan years.President, Ploughshares Fund; Author, \u0027Nuclear Nightmares: Securing the World Before It Is Too Late\u0027Muslims overwhelmingly have denounced acts of terrorism, and are in fact the greatest victims of terrorism around the world. Just as Christians are not responsible for extremist Christians, the same is so for Muslims.President, National Action NetworkI feel like my straight friends don\u0027t really understand what I mean when I tell them I\u0027m bisexual. For the record, I wanted to spell it all out. Yes, I am bisexual. No, I\u0027m not just going through a phase, and I\u0027m not confused.Bisexual and Bipolar writer whose honest and open writing delves into mental illness stigma, psychiatric hospitals, medication and recoveryThe images are indelible. A body washed up on a beach like sea glass, flotsam from an overcrowded boat. It is said that history has a way of repeating itself. And for me, these images -- this vocabulary -- recall a story that is more than 70 years old. That of the refugee ship, the St. Louis.Author of \u0027A Master Plan for Rescue\u0027Brussels remained on lockdown for a third straight day on Monday as authorities continued to carry out sweeping raids in an effort to capture Salah Abdeslam, the fugitive wanted in connection with the deadly terrorist attacks that struck Paris.Vocativ - news sourced from the deep web.In a perfect world, we would be turkey champions. We would remember to thaw our bird days in advance, brine it, maybe wiggle some butter under the skin. But when life actually hands us a 12-pound bird on the big day, we do as Top Chef judge Hugh Acheson does: spatchcock it.Recipes you can trust. 1 million cooks and counting.The National Mining Association\u0027s president recently wrote that the impact of uranium mining on Grand Canyon National Park is \"virtually nonexistent.\" That\u0027s about as reassuring as BP saying that deep water oil drilling poses virtually no risk to the Gulf of Mexico.Former U.S. Senator from Colorado; Board member, Grand Canyon TrustWe beg people who are suffering and suicidal to get help while at the same time shaming and stigmatizing them. We give mixed messages. Our shame is dated, unethical and cruel.Composer/Lyricist, Singer/Pianist, Teacher, Graduate Student, Mental Health AdvocateToday\u0027s topics include: The Latest on the Syrian Refugees and the GOP Response; House GOP Blocks Refugees; Obama Nails GOP Cowardice; Ted Cruz Asks Obama to Say It To His Face; and much more.Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez Show, Writer for Salon.comThe tone has been set by national leaders. Everywhere the rhetoric evokes emotions and symbols of war -- and war indeed is the word one hears repeatedly.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghNo matter how stuffed your guests are after the main meal, everyone will make room for these stunning sweets. No-bake chocolate cream pie with toasted meringue, anyone?Bon Appétit MagazineAfter 15 years of war it is plain to all but the most recalcitrant that the US cannot afford the All-Volunteer Force. Indeed, it is going to break the bank.Ret. Major General, US Army ReserveIt must be easier for conservative columnists to fret about those crazy students instead of focusing on the intellectual wasteland sprouting from what was supposed to be their think tank driven \"revolution of ideas.\" These writers are aghast that students from groups long discriminated against aren\u0027t just grateful to their institutions for allowing them on campus.President, Wesleyan UniversityWorking Americans haven\u0027t seen a real raise in 35 years. Meanwhile, every year, their health care costs rise. Their employers eliminate pensions. And their kids struggle with rising college tuition and debt. By contrast, on the other side of the Macy\u0027s Thanksgiving Day Parade, the richest 1 percent are supersizing their feasts.International President, United SteelworkersI have never known attachment like this. I have never so much as witnessed attachment like this. Picture me holding this baby while I do dishes, while I prepare meals, while I type e-mails, while I pee, while I do anything.Writer + photographerGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
