{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorIn yet another installment of the solid jobs reports we seen in recent months, February\u0027s payrolls were up by 295,000 and the unemployment rate ticked from 5.7 percent to 5.5 percent, the lowest it has been since mid-2008, according to this morning\u0027s job market update from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Still, while there\u0027s no doubt the labor market is improving, and doing so at a faster clip than in recent years, there are still missing ingredients suggesting that the US job market is not as close to full employment -- a truly tight matchup between jobs and job-seekers -- as the low jobless rate suggests.Business leaders call for action against all forms of violence and discrimination faced by women and encourage business to build companies that truly value diversityFounder, Virgin GroupCEO, UnileverChairman and CEO, Kering; Chairman of the Kering FoundationChattanooga has proven to everyone else that having a public option for internet, cable, and phone service is better for consumers. And though the big companies would never admit it, the competition that socialist local broadband networks provide is the heart of the free-market capitalism they claim to espouse.Co-Founder of US UncutThe Justice Department\u0027s report on the Ferguson police department should be read by anyone who believes in racial justice and reconciliation, because it shows us what we are still up against in 2015, 50 years after the Selma march. This is not a post-racial America, especially in regard to our policing and criminal justice systems. Ferguson has become a teaching parable for the nation.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersNow is the time to work toward a world without cancer, and other preventable diseases. Americans can be a stronger, more vigorous and productive society. Let\u0027s start with a healthy diet, and an active, energetic lifestyle. That\u0027s a change that\u0027s good for all of us.Board-certified radiologist; Board member, Lesscancer; Author, \u0027A World Without Cancer\u0027Founder, Lesscancer.orgHow long has it been... three... four years? Too long? Not long enough? I\u0027d say just about right myself.Singer/Songwriter - Noel Gallagher\u0027s High Flying BirdsGreen on Blue, a stunning debut novel by decorated veteran Elliot Ackerman, conveys not only the contradictions and duplicity of the war in Afghanistan, but of war itself.Writing a novel set in reunifying Berlin during the First Gulf War.There\u0027s more than enough evidence to show that educating girls is transformational not only to girls themselves but to everyone around them. With education, a girl will be better positioned over her lifetime to help herself and her family move out of poverty and avoid disease. That makes for stronger women and more resilient families, communities, nations and the world.27th Prime Minister of Australia; Board Chair, Global Partnership for EducationWhile Hillary Clinton is defending herself, Elizabeth Warren is building a legacy based on economic wisdom and genuine concern for middle class issues. As a result, Warren\u0027s words go viral often and her eloquence is appreciated by social media.Columnist, journalist, and author published in The Hill\u0027s Congress Blog, The Jerusalem Post, Salon.com, and other publicationsGrandparents can explain their concerns for their grandchildren. If they -- like me -- are old enough to have had measles or remember past epidemics, they can recall a person in their community who died or was impaired by this seemingly innocuous disease.Author; Resident Scholar, Women\u0027s Studies Research Center, Brandeis UniversityThe Ringling Bros. and Barnum \u0026 Bailey Circus announced Thursday that it will phase out the use of elephants in its circuses. Why? Because it knew that if it didn\u0027t do the \"right\" thing, it would be the end of its business.Managing Partner at Lerer Ventures, which incubated and is an investor in The DodoDoctors don\u0027t much care for conditions we don\u0027t understand well, can\u0027t treat effectively, and can\u0027t even confirm with a blood test. The frustration that results often translates into one of medicine\u0027s more common, and most regrettable missteps: blaming the victim. Patients with syndromes are often overtly, or at least covertly, blamed for their symptoms and engender an \"it\u0027s all in his/her head\" attitude in their doctor.Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterWhat this documentary did is to reignite the issue, even if for another brief moment. By banning it though, the Indian government has raised questions that are both urgent and dangerous. What does this mean for free speech in India, the world\u0027s largest democracy?Entrepreneur, writer and consultant; co-founder, Lala WinesEvery single thing we do, whether physical or mental, takes a toll on our brain. The more we use it, the more it needs to rest. If we go out to a crowded restaurant with a lot of noise and stimulation, we may simply get overloaded and need to go home and rest. Even reading or watching tv causes our brains to fatigue.Professional Photographer, Creative Business Coach, Writer, Traveler, life lover, TBI Survivor, and mommy to a rescue YorkieTo all of my precious students: My guess is that all of you will wonder why I am making you take these tests. And the answer is simple. I have to. Our state and federal government say that I have to give these tests to you. That you must take them. And I need you to know how very sorry I am about that.Fifth grade teacher, ChicagoDon\u0027t look now, but while marriage equality has been spreading across the country, homophobic lawmakers have found a sneaky new way to chip away at civil rights. And not just gay and lesbian civil rights -- EVERYONE\u0027S civil rights.Writer, photographer, explainer of the strange and wonderfulWho would have imagined that a national party, never mind the Republican Party, would be so opposed to finding any solution for the almost 12 million undocumented people already here that they would risk our national security during the dangerous time we are in now? Yet that\u0027s the reality of the GOP today, and it\u0027s our responsibility to hold them accountable.President, People For the American WayOur failure to set up all students for success in an increasingly technology-driven economy is not just limiting their futures. It\u0027s limiting our country\u0027s future as well.Congressman for the 4th District of MassachusettsThe Arizona Legislature argues this citizen legislation represents a violent break with the Framers\u0027 constitutional vision. But, in fact, it is Clement and the Arizona Legislature who offer the radical interpretation.Counsel for the Brennan Center’s Democracy ProgramThe people and police officers of Ferguson can ill afford to allow the difficult but necessary reform process that\u0027s now underway to be subsumed by petty politics. To plunge headlong into a dialogue defined by the same narrow, reductive, zero-sum talking points that frame so much of our national debate would be an inexcusable mistake.Writer; former chief speechwriter to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder; veteran of Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.The sci-fi fable, about a robot that gains sentience, has an intriguing premise at its core, but it\u0027s rare to see a talented filmmaker with so many tools and so much talent at his disposal squander a compelling idea so thoroughly.Media Scholar and Critic, zakiscorner.comRegardless of whether you are young or old, healthy or ill, insured or uninsured, every person, in every state, has a stake in King v. Burwell.California Attorney General; Author, \u0027Smart on Crime\u0027Heat waves, droughts, wildfires, and other extreme weather events -- some of the most troubling, costly, and immediate impacts of climate change -- pose very real threats to our public health, infrastructure, and economy.U.S. Representative for California\u0027s 24th DistrictBy now, if the telecom companies had kept their promises we might well have a national broadband network that would be the envy of the world. Instead many consider the United States a laggard in high speed, affordable broadband.Director, The Public Good Initiative, Institute for Local Self-RelianceWomen have come a long way in developed and developing countries, but significant gaps remain. We believe that mobile technology will go a long way in helping us close those gaps, empowering women with information, services and ultimately, confidence, that will help them best care for themselves, and their families.Emmy Award-winning journalistExecutive Director of MAMA (Maternal Alliance for Mobile Action)I\u0027 m 60. I could pass for younger. But why should I? I\u0027d rather be honest than coy about my age. But while I\u0027d never claim to be younger than I am, in my little AARP-aged heart I don\u0027t FEEL that old.I write for the New York Times and the Funny Times.Is ISIS medieval? However much ISIS is committed to returning the world to the seventh century, their atrocities have a more complicated genealogy that stretches from the beheadings of the Middle Ages through the tortures of 18th-century France all the way up to the present day.Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogIt is hard to think of a more despicable crime than the buying and selling of other human beings, especially children. Yet we know that it is happening right here in America, every day. Each year, thousands of children are bought and sold for sex. That should keep all of us awake at night.Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary CommitteeSurvivor, Advocate, and Author of Walking PreySometimes you don\u0027t want to talk, you don\u0027t want to analyze your life or apply for One. More. Job. You just want to lose yourself in a book that gets you. And with that, Dear Reader, I give you four books to help you through your quarter-life crisis.WriterNetanyahu has legitimate cause to sound the alarm about the threat Iran poses. His speech, however, will do little to improve the substance of any agreement. What is more injurious is his insinuation that Obama will accede to a \"bad deal\" even though it will be to Israel\u0027s detriment.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUThe return viewer to The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel might wonder if the unexpected and considerable box office gold of the original film can be struck again and, indeed, if the aging British boomers in the film can also find a second coming in their golden years. And therein lies the heart of both movies, namely taking a lucid and kindly look at aging.Medical editor, mental health for The Huffington PostGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"MOMENT OF TRUTH",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
