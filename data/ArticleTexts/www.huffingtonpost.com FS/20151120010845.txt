{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLog\"Do something witchy,\" Charlie Manson told his followers. \"Leave a sign to show the world you were there.\" At first blush, the Islamic State would seem to be acting with all the irrationality of a mass murderer by encouraging and taking credit for brazen acts like the Paris massacres, the Beirut bombings, and the downing of the Russian passenger jet over the Sinai peninsula. By striking at French, Lebanese, and Russian citizens and bolstering the resolve of the world community to unite against it, the Islamic State would seem to be signing its own death warrant. But there is a rationale, if not a rationality, behind the Islamic State\u0027s \"foreign policy\" of killing foreigners.What makes the Republicans discourse on Islam and the Muslim world dangerous is that it is disseminated through a wide and powerful network of media outlets and rightwing think tanks then consumed by a public with no direct contact or firsthand knowledge of the Muslim world.British Tunisian writer and Middle East expertThe portraits of black professors, the ones that bring me and so many other black students feelings of pride and promise, were defaced. Their faces were covered with a single piece of black tape, crossing them out of Harvard Law School\u0027s legacy of legal scholarship.2L at Harvard Law SchoolNo is a powerful word. To me, it\u0027s the single most powerful word in the English language. Said clearly, strongly and with enough frequency and force, it can alter the course of history.Creator and Executive Producer of Grey’s Anatomy and Scandal and Executive Producer of How to Get Away With MurderAfter a horrific tragedy like the one in Paris, your work should not scream, \"Look at meeeee!\" You, as a journalist, are not the story.JournalistAMMAN, Jordan -- Denying refugees protection violates international law and offers what ISIS aims to achieve: borders between people, coexistence denied. The proper response to violence, terror and suffering is not to withdraw, but to extend. Instead of denying human rights and closing borders to refugees, which ISIS would love to see, we should find new ways to protect rights and help the displaced.Secretary General, Norwegian Refugee Council; Former Special Advisor, UN Secretary General for Conflict Prevention and Resolution (2006-2008)Why blame the victims of terror for the evil acts of the terrorists?Founder and President, Tanenbaum Center for Interreligious UnderstandingOf the four doctors who worked on me, not one had mental health screenings in place for their patients, except for asking if I had a history of depression, which I said I did, and that was that. None of the doctors suggested I consult a psychologist for what was clearly a psychological issue.Actor, StudentPerhaps the claim that we live in a \"post-racial society\" is an expression of hope, and maintaining hope is nothing short of a moral imperative in today\u0027s uncertain world. I suspect, however, that the term \"post-racial society\" is also an expression of denial, an invitation to turn away from reality.Freelance writerJesus and his parents were Middle Eastern refugees. The nativity scene, after all, depicts a Middle Eastern family who were looking for a place to stay, only to be told there was no room for them.Founding and lead pastor, One Church; founder, openmindedchurch.orgIf you cherry-pick scientific truths to serve cultural, economic, religious or political objectives, you undermine the foundations of an informed democracy.Author, \u0027Space Chronicles: Facing the Ultimate Frontier\u0027; follow him @neiltysonFor over thirty years we\u0027ve treated something as fact which is actually false. Economists we trusted to know better didn\u0027t, and so people have suffered and continue to suffer. This pernicious economic myth is the idea that a rising yacht lifts all tides, or as more popularly described, \"trickle-down economics.\"Writer and basic income advocateThe \"radical elements\" that are causing \"a lot of turmoil and trouble\" in \"this arc of instability\" are, in fact, Islamists whom Clinton picked as allies in the region, and she has pressed to supply them with arms in Syria as well as Libya. She really rates mention as an American mover of the \"instability\" in the region second only to Bush and Cheney.Professor of Literature, Yale UniversityWhat bin Laden grasped before 9/11: with a relatively small number of followers, he and his movement couldn\u0027t hope to create the world of their fervid dreams. If, however, he could lure the planet\u0027s \"sole superpower\" into stepping into his universe, military first, it would change everything and so do his work for him.Editor, TomDispatch.comI see it happening all the time -- women who went to Ivy League schools and who held highly-demanding, high-status, high-pay jobs -- deciding to stay at home after they have a baby. They all thought carefully about their decisions, weighing the pros and cons. Instead of the prison of a 9 to 5 work culture, they preferred to keep their brains sharp and stay connected by volunteering and sitting on boards.CEO, The Creative Class Group \u0026 Best-Selling Author, UpgradeBefore arriving in the United States, child refugees often live in rural areas or refugee camps where medicine, food and Western luxuries are seldom available.Vocativ - news sourced from the deep web.The good news is a compelling candidate can win without the most money, the bad news is campaigns continue to waste millions and millions of dollars. They would be better off building homes for the homeless with it, and solving some actual societal problems as real leaders do.Political strategistThis rigs the game against families and smaller businesses that have to pick up the slack. Families and small U.S. companies pay 17.5 percent. The biggest corporations pay less, even zero.Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureRacism is no longer about race (skin color) but culture. People are Othered and discriminated against not (simply) because of the color of their skin (or other phenotypes) but because of their beliefs and practices associated with some \"imagined culture.\"Sociologist, Speaker, WriterIf hatred answers hatred, the problem will never end. The time has come to apply the balm of compassion to our wounds, our pain, and the madness of the world.Author, photographer, humanitarian,prominent speakerIt is so easy to simplify things, and to cast blame for the horrors we are witnessing today by demonizing an entire religious community for the actions that a tiny fraction of them committed. But we are smarter than that. To understand how to fight terror, we need to understand how we got here.Social Entrepreneur, Founder and Executive Director of The Nawaya Network, Development ConsultantRaising the minimum wage is both an economic and a moral issue. The economics are clear: Gradually raising the minimum wage to $15 over five years will lift families out of poverty, improve the local economy, and help students overcome obstacles to success in school.E.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeRepublicans are currently in a frenzy over Syria. But for all their noise, I notice there is not a single voice crying out to actually change anything in the most concrete way they have at their disposal.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comPeople are demanding to be released from the tyranny of the annual BS Test. And somehow, test manufacturers are going to try to look like heroes for offering even larger doses of what test opponents are trying to escape. Instead of of narrow, crappy data once a year, we\u0027ll be harvesting crappy data every day.Teacher and writer; blogger, curmudgucation.blogspot.comIn 2015, somewhere in the neighborhood of 1 billion Internet of Things (IoT) devices will be purchased, an increase of 60 percent over the previous year. There will be 10 billion IoT devices connected to the Internet this year.Author of Swiped. Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and IDT911Western openness exemplifies our best values. Unlike tyrannical regimes like Assad\u0027s or roving bands of murderers like ISIL, such openness is inclusive. Tolerant. And by being tolerant at home, we promote tolerance abroad. We lead by example.Columnist, 3L at Harvard LawChronic pain can be tough to live with, but these 10 daily habits may help you ease your discomfort and enjoy your life.Berkeley Wellness offers you positive ways to live a long, healthful life.Like many strong, independent women, I was committed to not losing myself in a relationship. I watched my mom within my parent\u0027s relationship and I translated that she had lost herself and her freedom. I realize now that she\u0027s a women strong enough to let someone take care of her.Love Coach + Intuitive who works with ambitious, busy women create Soul Level Love with a man at their level.A Black female student\u0027s violent assault and arrest by a school police officer at Spring Valley High School in South Carolina has exposed a wider audience to the dangerous consequences of embedding police in schools.Assistant Professor of Sociology and African American Studies, Columbia University; Author, \u0027Unequal City: Race, Schools, and Perceptions of Injustice\u0027A new poll out of New Hampshire shows front runner Donald Trump gaining momentum while Dr. Ben Carson is losing ground. And herein lies the makings of Jeb Bush\u0027s path to the Republican presidential nomination.Political and Pop Culture AnalystTalking to Frydman is a bit like entering a fascinating meditation on the limits of knowledge and the nature of truth. Having lived through the failure of centralized planning in communist Poland, he is particularly sensitive to the hubris of believing that the future can be exactly mapped.Author and cultural theoristGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
