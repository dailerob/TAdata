{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Chief financial writer, The Huffington PostAfter months of being hounded to release tax returns, Mitt Romney finally released some tax returns. Too bad they weren\u0027t the interesting ones. It remains to be seen just how much goodwill the $1.75 million in foresworn tax deductions will buy Romney, given his recent assertion that the half of the population that pays no income taxes is a bunch of irresponsible layabouts. But his still-low tax rate, which is below the 15 percent federal payroll tax rate that some of that bunch of irresponsible layabouts pays, will raise questions about the fairness of our tax system. Meanwhile, we still wait fruitlessly for Romney\u0027s tax returns from prior years, which promise to be far more interesting than this one.Read Post | Comments (810)James Zogby, 09/22/12President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027The crisis created by the film The Innocence of Muslims that many feared might spin out of control seems to be subsiding across the Arab World.
