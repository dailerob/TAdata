{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, Speaker Boehner flat-out rejected President Obama\u0027s request to unveil his new jobs plan at a joint session of Congress this coming Wednesday, saying Thursday would be better. Forget actually taking action on the unemployment crisis -- they can\u0027t even agree on the date for a speech about the unemployment crisis! A few days later, the Labor Department released the worst jobs report in 11 months. So here\u0027s the official tally: debates about the scheduling of a jobs speech, 1; jobs created in the last quarter, 0.

Nevertheless, Western politicians are claiming victory. Yet the ultimate consequences of allied intervention remain uncertain.
