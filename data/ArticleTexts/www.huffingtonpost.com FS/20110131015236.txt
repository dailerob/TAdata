{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"At this week\u0027s State of the Union, President Obama succeeded in shifting the tone from \"You Lie!\" to what HuffPost\u0027s Howard Fineman called a \"\u0027Love Train\u0027 Moment.\" Hollywood should take note because no sooner were this year\u0027s Oscar nominations announced than the dirty politicking began, with charges that The King\u0027s Speech is historically inaccurate and that the sympathetic stuttering monarch at its center was actually a dim-witted Nazi appeaser. It used to be that we had to wait until an election year for negative campaigning, rumor-mongering, mud-slinging, and win-at-all-cost consultants.
