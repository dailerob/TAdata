Supposedly we needed the healthy young\u0027uns to subsidize the rest of the population. The other big myth that got killed in 2014 was that we needed to fear deflation.

Iranians here in the diaspora mourn too, for the lives taken, and for the as-yet-unknown loss of momentum toward a harmonious peace and place in the world untainted by the actions of a few.Host and producer, HuffPost LiveThere are days when I imagine that the energy Duncan expends just holding cognitive dissonance at bay must be enough to power a small country (like, say, Estonia).Teacher and writer; blogger, curmudgucation.blogspot.comHanukkah (whose 8 day holiday starts tonight Tuesday Dec. 16) and Christmas share a spiritual message: that it is possible to bring light and hope in a world of darkness, oppression and despair.Editor, Tikkun MagazineThat moment.
