{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Executive Arts and Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post Media GroupMemo to President Barack Obama from your powerful friends in Hollywood: You are the president of the United States, clothed in immense power. Now use it. That, at least, seems to be the message of Lincoln, Steven Spielberg\u0027s surprisingly riveting examination of the 16th president\u0027s campaign to persuade that unruly collection of hicks, fanatics and thieves known as the House of Representatives to pass a Constitutional amendment abolishing slavery. Lincoln\u0027s Republican party outnumbered their Democratic rivals, but Constitutional Amendments require a two-thirds majority. So the challenge was to keep the Republican caucus in line and pick off about 20 votes from the other side. And so the arm-twisting began. If that sounds familiar, it should. It\u0027s reasonable to think that this film couldn\u0027t and wouldn\u0027t have been made at any other time.Read Post | Comments (275)Howard Fineman, 11/12/12Editorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupThe story teaches an old lesson: It\u0027s virtually impossible to overstate the comical hypocrisy of our leaders, especially those lionized to the point of canonization by a credulous media in search of uplift.Read Post | Comments (134)Tae Yoo, 11.12.2012Senior Vice President, Corporate Affairs, CiscoIt is expected that within the next four years, approximately 1 million U.S. Armed Forces personnel will transition from military to civilian life, including about 300,000 retirements by August 2013. Unfortunately, military servicemen and servicewomen often have a difficult time transitioning to jobs in the private sector once their duty is complete.Read Post | Comments (23)Robert Reich, 11/12/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Assuming the goal in the Grand Bargain is $4 trillion of deficit reduction over the next decade (that\u0027s the consensus of the Simpson-Bowles commission, the Congressional Budget Office, and most independent analysts), here\u0027s what the President should propose.Read Post | Comments (106)Oprah Winfrey, 11/11/12Chairman and CEO, Oprah Winfrey NetworkMy life is better when I get still regularly. Call it meditation or call it quiet time -- doesn\u0027t matter. The benefits are the same. If you stay with the practice, it\u0027s like developing spiritual muscle. I promise you will become less stressed, more focused.Read Post | Comments (175)Cenk Uygur, 11/12/12Host, \u0027The Young Turks\u0027First of all, let\u0027s establish that no one in Washington actually cares about balancing the budget. If they did, they would love this so-called Fiscal Cliff. The Grand Bargain is a Grand Lie. Anyone who argues for it is either a fool or a charlatan.Read Post | Comments (642)Amy Ephron, 11/12/12AuthorAs I watched as Petraeus tendered his resignation to the military and tepidly thanked his wife \"Hol,\" I was horrified and saddened. This is their personal tragedy and I\u0027m curious to see what decision she makes -- but another question lingers, perhaps a more interesting ethical question.Read Post | CommentsD.L. Hughley, 11/12/12Actor and stand-up comedianRepublicans are having a hard time believing that Barack Obama was elected by \"the people,\" and the problem they are having is that \"the people\" is no longer a phrase synonymous with white America.Read Post | Comments (79)Dena Takruri, 11/12/12HuffPost Live ProducerThe dismal reality is that most people working in the service industry are grossly underpaid, earning a federal minimum wage of $2.13 per hour. Customers\u0027 tips are not only taken as an expression of gratitude -- they are essential to our service workers\u0027 livelihoods.Read Post | Comments (95)Dan Froomkin, 11/12/12Senior Washington Correspondent, Huffington PostThe disenfranchisement that results from strict requirements for current, government-issued photo ID is concentrated in certain demographic groups, among the elderly, the poor, the disabled and non-drivers. Many are minorities; many vote Democratic.Read Post | Comments (340)Rita Cosby, 11/11/12TV Host, veteran correspondentAs the embassy dignitaries solemnly approached me to officially present my father\u0027s medal, my eyes immediately filled with tears. They caringly placed one of his country\u0027s highest honors into the palm of my shaking hand. It was a profound and overwhelming moment that was decades in the making.Read Post | Comments (23)Amitai Etzioni, 11/12/12GWU ProfessorThe nation deserves consolation -- the loss to America of General Petraeus is much smaller than the media has made it out to be.Read Post | CommentsEugene Jarecki, 11/12/12Award-winning dramatic and documentary filmmakerThinking about the broader state of the nation, the presidential election left me with a mixed range of emotions. But as one of many working to end the ongoing injustice of America\u0027s war on drugs, developments at the state level around the country gave me renewed hope.Read Post | CommentsRichard C. Leone, 11/12/12Senior Fellow and Fmr. President, The Century FoundationThere are many problems with O\u0027Reilly\u0027s argument but none is more fundamental than his assertion that past majorities of Americans (as a group, as white as the folks at a Republican convention) were not interested in \"stuff from the government.\"Read Post | Comments (105)Jill Di Donato, 11/12/12Writer, Adjunct Professor of English, The Fashion Institute of Technology, New YorkI write this knowing that I will offend people; I risk my reputation and open myself up for judgment. But I also am thankful for the chance to say, I am truly sorry for hurting others, and myself.Read Post | Comments (316)Michelangelo Signorile, 11/12/12Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesThe hate we\u0027ve seen spewed into the political discourse this year was among the worst we\u0027ve seen, with preachers calling for gays to be rounded up or killed by the government, but it\u0027s going to get uglier. When they start talking about \"revolution\" and \"revolt,\" we all had better pay attention.Read Post | Comments (329)Robert Kuttner, 11/11/12Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The good news is that the Democrats won the election and President Obama\u0027s spine has been stiffened on the subject of taxes.Read Post | Comments (594)James Brobyn, 11/11/12Executive Director, the Travis Manion FoundationSome people don\u0027t ask me to explain why certain odors elicit such a visceral emotion. Perhaps they are unsure or even afraid of what I might say next. But for those who want to hear what I experienced in combat, I will always continue. It\u0027s a story I want to tell.Read Post | Comments (65)James Franco, 11/12/12Actor and authorMy first chapbook came out, Strongest of the Litter, but people seem to be more interested in who I\u0027m dating than poetry.Read Post | Comments (50)Kevin O\u0027Brien, 11/09/12CEO Veteran Recruiting ServicesTo all of you who are serving, or have served, we sincerely thank you for your service, but more importantly, we are here to help you make your transition as smooth as possible by helping you find employment.Read Post | CommentsKristin Rowe-Finkbeiner, 11/12/12Executive Director/CEO and Co-Founder of MomsRising.orgWhy are military leaders concerned about childhood obesity? It\u0027s a shocking fact that approximately one in four young adults is too overweight to join the military.Read Post | CommentsRuth Bettelheim, Ph.D. and Geralynn S. Knorr, MS CCC, 11/10/12We know that traumatic brain injury increases rates of suicide and that it is the \"signature injury\" of the current wars. Yet it frequently goes undetected, or is misdiagnosed as PTSD or depression. Patients who are misdiagnosed, and therefore mistreated, are unlikely to recover. Instead, they are likely to despair.Read Post | Comments (103)Damon Dahlen, 11/12/12Staff Photographer at AOLTwo weeks ago, I found myself in a little over three feet of rising water, fighting off the current\u0027s attempts to tug me under, all for a photo.Read Post | Comments (13)Leo Hindery, Jr., 11/12/12Chairman, U.S. Economy/Smart Globalization Initiative at the New America FoundationThe recent elections clearly showed that in the minds of the electorate it\u0027s past time to restore vibrancy to the middle class and restore for all citizens the American Dream of equal opportunity, economic advance and fair employment.Read Post | Comments (56)HuffPost Radio, 11/11/12In our \"after report,\" Reagan and Matalin discuss whether 2012 turned on Messina\u0027s GOTV or Obama\u0027s views on government and taxes.
