{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghWe all are acutely aware that Washington is in a serious jam because of the mounting threat to the Baghdad regime amidst signs of military and political unraveling. The United States is reaping the whirlwind from its 12 years of reckless \"War On Terror\" in the Middle East. The disastrous Iraqi invasion/occupation is the direct cause. Strategically incoherent and disjointed American actions elsewhere are also essential parts of the story. For there has been no systemic logic guiding policies from place to place, from issue to issue. Yet the intersection and overlap of developments are the hallmark of the region\u0027s politics. In short, we have not been up to the task intellectually or diplomatically. Moreover, our leaders have indulged their own parochial interests and the escapist mentality of the public by refusing to face squarely either the error of our ways or the contradictory nature of our objectives.We hope more employers will join us in making an investment in tomorrow\u0027s workforce by increasing access to a college degree. We need a new approach from leaders who will join us in taking up the mantle to do the right thing: for our companies, for our communities, for our country.CEO of Starbucks Coffee CompanyPresident of Arizona State UniversityReality is that Iran and the US need each other. And both of them need to recognize the other\u0027s ability to play a stabilizing role. Few things have been as destabilizing for the region than the US-Iran enmity.President, National Iranian American CouncilHis show arrived right at the moment when it seemed like America was coming apart, culturally, spiritually, and politically -- and promised us, in a tone that was relentlessly upbeat yet somehow never smarmy, that we actually could be one nation under a groove, that for three or four hours we could share a common bond.Author, \u0027Tear Down This Myth\u0027Mona Lisa\u0027s life spanned the most tumultuous chapters in the history of Florence, decades of war, rebellion, invasion, siege -- and of the greatest artistic outpouring the world has ever seen.Author of MONA LISA: A Life Discovered and LA BELLA LINGUA and a widely published, award-winning freelance journalistThe United States has already sacrificed enough of its soldiers and treasury for Iraq during its eight years of involvement in that nation\u0027s so-called struggle for freedom. From the beginning, the war was based on a falsehood, namely the notion that Iraq harbored weapons of mass destruction.Author and Fellow at the Century FoundationThe US Chamber of Commerce is wrong, both ethically and operationally. The Chamber\u0027s ethical position is that the US does not have to care about the damages it causes to the rest of the world. This is a special kind of arrogance certainly not unknown in the US corporate sector.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \"To Move the World: JFK\u0027s Quest for Peace\"Calling the war a \"mistake\" is the language of denial, not contrition: it minimizes the Iraq War\u0027s disastrous consequences, removes blame, and deprives Americans of any chance to learn from our generation\u0027s foreign policy disaster.Fmr. 16-year Member of US Congress; Two-time US Presidential CandidateThe media message to Clinton was clear last week: You can\u0027t lose your cool when dealing with the press. You can\u0027t try to intimidate reporters. Who is allowed to do all those things? Chris Christie, for one.Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaYoga is a way of giving back. The gift of life. Your body is a temple and if you give in, you will find universality. Yoga clears the mind and energizes the body and one is at peace with oneself and the universe. Yoga gives me a reason to wake up every day. Each day is a creative and positive day, when I\u0027m practicing yoga.Dancer and musicianWhile it was widely reported that Perry had likened homosexuality to alcoholism, it went almost unnoticed that the Texas GOP platform had removed its prior call to recriminalize homosexuality. And that may be a key fact in understanding what is going on in the minds of Texas GOP leaders.Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesThe sustainability of Israel as a homeland for the Jewish people has always been dependent on its ability to deliver justice to the Palestinians. We learned in South Africa that the only way to end apartheid peacefully was to force the powerful to the table through economic pressure.Archbishop Emeritus of Cape TownThe conservative mantra is that under our constitutional system, the people\u0027s elected representatives are supposed to make such decisions, not unelected judges. Conservatives\u0027 delight in the Vergara decision seems utterly inconsistent with this principle.Law Professor, Yale; Author, \u0027Why Government Fails So Often, and How It Can Do Better\u0027Here is a plea -- not just from me -- but from my generation of young Afghans. The soldiers you have lost did not die in vain -- the money you have spent has not been wasted -- PLEASE -- don\u0027t throw away what you have achieved. We are going to need your help for a few more years yet. It won\u0027t be forever -- but it will be longer than two and a half years.Tteaching part time for a university and working as a translator and cultural advisor for a number of NGOsIt\u0027s painfully ironic and embarrassing that the greatest and wealthiest country in the world has more than 600,000 people experiencing homelessness on any given night.Grammy-winning rapperThe crisis of sexual assault on campus is very real, but likely not what you understand it to be. Some parents have conveniently brushed-off what has tragically escalated to a weekly flow of news stories about a rape at this college or that college.President, The New AgendaThe bottom line is that when you are having concerns, speak up! Communicate, rather than investigate. This approach is the best way to respect yourself, your partner and the relationship.Psychotherapist, danielalcsw.comRather than confront poverty by extending jobless benefits to the long-term unemployed, endorsing a higher minimum wage or supporting jobs programs, conservative Republicans are taking a different tack. They\u0027re peddling three big lies about poverty.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027As James Harrington, lawyer for Ramzi bin al Shibh, told the court on Monday: \"We now have to represent to our client that we had a spy within our team for a number of months. We don\u0027t know what activities that spy did.\" Will Harrington\u0027s client ever trust his defense team again? Should he? And if he can\u0027t, can he ever truly receive a fair defense?Senior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstCalifornia Superior Court Judge Rolf Treu ruled in Vergara v. California that the solution to the long-standing, complex challenge of ensuring all children, particularly underserved children, have access to high-quality public education is to strip teachers of their rights. Period. End of story.President, American Federation of TeachersWe traveled to Mount Athos to revel in one another\u0027s company, to savor each moment left to us, to testify to the sanctity of being. We went to Byzantium so our souls could clap hands and sing. If that\u0027s not where God is, I don\u0027t know where else to look.USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorThe two Group G underdogs should be looking for a win and three points with matches looming against Portugal and Germany. Here\u0027s what you can expect from the teams as play unfolds.Managing Blog Editor, The Huffington PostAs a Sikh American, I am dumbfounded by the irresponsible Islamophobic discourse that took place on two recent Fox News national broadcasts, The O\u0027Reilly Factor and Fox and Friends, in which Robert Bergdahl was criticized for his appearance, namely his beard.Executive Director, Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund (SALDEF)After so many marched, organized, petitioned, registered voters, and risked their lives and livelihoods -- and some even died -- how do we as a country allow their victories to be stripped away before our very eyes? If there was ever a time to have a renewed Freedom Summer, that time is now, in 2014.President, National Action NetworkWhy haven\u0027t any big bankers been prosecuted for their role in the housing crisis that led to the Great Recession?Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyThere are always a ton of comments made at a vegetarian\u0027s expense: \"Where do you get your protein?\" or \"You don\u0027t eat meat at ALL?!\" and \"Why are you doing this? You must be hungry a lot.\"Blog editor, The Huffington PostHow to Train Your Dragon 2 could have been great. But one detail holds it back from greatness, and that\u0027s the decision of writer and director Dean DeBlois to make the only non-white character in the film the super-evil mega-villain.Poet, author, and activistWhy are we on the brink of disaster? If you don\u0027t know the answer to that, you\u0027re not watching Fox News. It\u0027s President Obama\u0027s fault! Or, as Greta Van Susteren innocently asks her guests each night, \"Is this President Obama\u0027s fault?\"Contributing Writer, Onion News NetworkBill and I thought a lot about what we wanted to say, and we tried to imagine what might be helpful to the graduates, and we came up with a speech about optimism... with a twist. We talked about the times we felt least optimistic.Co-chair, the Bill and Melinda Gates FoundationIf Kafka were around to design a plan for governance, the result would be this pay-your-own-way approach. When government tries to make some citizens pay for services we all rely on, the results are at best bizarre, at worst sinister.Associate Professor \u0026 Academic Success Director at UNH Law, Affiliate at Berkman Center for Internet \u0026 Society at Harvard UniversitySome grandmas and grandpas consider being a grandparent their second chance at parenting, their opportunity to do things right, do things forgotten.writer, blogger, Grandma\u0027s BriefsGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"USA! 2-1 THRILLER",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
