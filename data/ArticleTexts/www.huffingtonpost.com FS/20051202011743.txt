{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"APAs promised, Bill O’Reilly has published his enemies list. All three of them. That’s right, out of the ever-expanding media universe, O’Reilly has identified just the New York Daily News, the St. Petersburg Times, and MSNBC as having “regularly helped distribute defamation and false information”. Perhaps sensing that his ballyhooed dishonor roll was a little light on enemies -- nowhere near the 205 Communists working in the State Department Joe McCarthy claimed to have on a list -- O’Reilly promised to “add more names to this list”. Let me give him a hand. Actually 20,000 hands -- belonging to the 10,000 people who have proudly signed on to HuffPost’s “Join the O’Reilly Blacklist” campaign.READ POST | comments (26)12.02.2005 Laurie DavidFor every week of winter lost due to warming, adult polar bears lose 22 pounds because their food supply is so scarce.
