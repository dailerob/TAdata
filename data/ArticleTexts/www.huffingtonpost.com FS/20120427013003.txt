Your resourceful neighbor points out that you could probably also use a hammer, a drill, and a saw. If you\u0027re the FHFA, you tell him, \"I can do a better job with just my duct tape, so thanks but no thanks.\" That, in a nutshell, is the problem with the most recent analysis by this key regulator of the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac when it comes to adding the tool of principal reduction to their anti-foreclosure toolkit.
