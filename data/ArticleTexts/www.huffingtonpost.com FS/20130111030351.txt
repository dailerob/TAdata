{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Assoc. Professor, Univ. of Missouri, Kansas City; Sr. regulator during S\u0026L debacleObama likes to surround himself with failures. Geithner set the pattern. He was supposed to be the principal regulator of most of the largest U.S. bank holding companies. He was an abject failure. Lew has gone from failure to failure. He was one of the architects of both of the Clinton administration\u0027s disastrous statutory deregulatory actions that helped produce the epidemic of accounting control fraud that drove the Great Recession. Emanuel and Daley were failures as directors of Fannie and Freddie. Obama has put failed anti-regulators in positions where they can best undermine the regulatory effort that is essential to reduce the risk and harm of future crises.Read Post | Comments (297)Robert Reich, 01/10/13Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Anyone who thinks congressional Republicans will roll over on the debt ceiling or gun control or other pending hot-button issues hasn\u0027t been paying attention. But the president can use certain tools that come with his office to achieve some of his objectives.Read Post | Comments (818)Marlo Thomas, 01/10/13Award-winning actress, author and activistA new year has arrived, and a lot of you have written in and told us that you want to start it off with a jump start on your career. So, in this rough economy, we thought it would be a good idea to get some expert advice and tips to keep in mind when you\u0027re searching for jobs, securing an interview, and ultimately landing the position you really want.Read Post | Comments (94)Eric Boehlert, 01/10/13Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaThe Hagel story, in which Obama made an effort to change the tone in Washington, D.C. by including a Republican in his Cabinet, only to have the goodwill gesture trampled by Republicans, perfectly captures the skewed way the news media depict modern-day politics.Read Post | Comments (141)Lisa Belkin, 01/09/13Senior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, The Huffington Post\"These people need to chill\", I thought, followed quickly by \"they will never find anyone willing to work for them.\" To my surprise, though, the one that lingered was \"Lord, I didn\u0027t ask any of the right questions when I was hiring, did I?\"Read Post | Comments (72)Christopher Elliott, 01/09/13Author of the book Scammed: How to Save Your Money and Find Better Service in a World of Schemes, Swindles and Shady DealsWhen we\u0027re screened at the airport, we\u0027re separate, but we\u0027re not equal.Read Post | Comments (241)David Rothschild, 01/10/13EconomistIn our initial likelihoods of victory for the big six categories, Lincoln is our most likely winner in three: best actor (Daniel Day-Lewis) at near certainty, best picture at 94 percent, and best director (Steven Spielberg) at 70 percent.Read Post | Comments (56)Rabbi Arthur Waskow, 01/10/13Founder and director, Shalom CenterWhile I would certainly have opposed any governmental attempt to prohibit its release, it is shameful that Zero Dark Thirty was even considered for an Oscar -- an award, an honor, a celebration.Read Post | Comments (29)Jeffrey Young, 01/10/13Huffington Post Health Care ReporterWe hear a lot about how Medicare spending is out of control and will bankrupt the federal government if left unchecked. Against that backdrop, a report issued by the Department of Health and Human Services today includes findings that might surprise some people.Read Post | CommentsKaren J. Greenberg, 01/10/13Director, Center on National Security at Fordham Law School11 years to the day after the Bush administration opened its notorious prison at Guantanamo Bay, Zero Dark Thirty opens nationwide. The filmmakers and distributors are evidently ignorant of the significance of the date -- a perfect indication of the carelessness and thoughtlessness of the film.Read Post | Comments (102)Mark Gongloff, 01/10/13Chief financial writer, The Huffington PostWhile it\u0027s easy to appreciate the trillion-dollar-coin idea as an intellectual exercise and a highly successful troll of the Washington establishment, and maybe even as a teaching moment in policy making, at the end of the day it doesn\u0027t stand a chance of happening.Read Post | Comments (29)Jeff Danziger, 01/10/13Political cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideRead Post | Comments (20)Barbara Hannah Grufferman, 01/10/13Author, \u0027The Best of Everything After 50\u0027; columnist, AARP; Chief Pundit, FOFA few weeks ago I turned 56. To commemorate and celebrate, I ran 5.6 miles around Central Park. It felt good knowing I could run that distance and still be fit enough to join my husband and daughters at a birthday dinner downtown a few hours later. That\u0027s a sea change from when I turned 50.Read Post | Comments (86)Scott Mendelson, 01/10/13Film critic at Mendelson\u0027s Memos, Valley Scene MagazineThe Gangster Squad is not a good movie. But it is that rarity in today\u0027s ultra-aware and uber-cynical age; a film so gleefully absurd and ridiculously cliched that it achieves a kind of skewed entertainment value.Read Post | CommentsBill McKibben, 01/10/13Author of a dozen books, including \u0027The End of Nature\u0027 and \u0027Deep Economy\u0027Thanks to the same fossil fuel industry that\u0027s ripping apart Aboriginal lands, we\u0027re at the very end of our rope as a species; it\u0027s time, finally, to listen to the people we\u0027ve spent the last five centuries shunting to one side.Read Post | Comments (78)Geoffrey R. Stone, 01/09/13Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoOpponents of laws regulating the sale, manufacture and use of guns fervently invoke the Second Amendment. In their view, the Second Amendment forbids the government to regulate guns. Period. End of discussion. But it is more complicated than that.Read Post | Comments (4,376)Bill Moyers, 01/10/13Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyRead Post | CommentsPeter Mehlman, 01/10/13Television writer; Producer, Seinfeld; Host, Narrow World of SportsSomehow, after 236 years under spacious skies, we\u0027ve reached a place where having it all only accents what we lack. The shortfalls of our lives glint in the corner of our eyes and rather than look away, we sit and discount our blessings.Read Post | CommentsJames Boyle and Jennifer Jenkins, 01/10/13We would like to persuade you that 2012 held a less-noticed Court decision that deserves your attention. It has to do with our collective culture. Because in 2012 the Supreme Court decided that Congress could take it away from us. No, really. That is what they decided.Read Post | CommentsRichard Bangs, 01/10/13Author, \u0027The Lost River\u0027I combed through this dangerous catalogue, and picked out what I think will be the best adventures for 2013 -- and I have personally tested them all, and reported about each on Huffington Post.Read Post | CommentsBianca Bosker, 01/09/13Executive Tech Editor, The Huffington PostKids these days. Just what are they up to online? Intrigued by one tenth-grader\u0027s musings (via her brother) on trends in the tech world, investor Garry Tan conducted an informal survey of how 1,000 teens and twenty-somethings are using social media.Read Post | Comments (398)Dan Froomkin, 01/09/13Contributing editor, Nieman ReportsDo yourself a favor, and don\u0027t go see Zero Dark Thirty. Don\u0027t encourage film-making that at best offers ambiguity about torture, and at worst endorses it. Spend the two and a half hours and the $10 on something more valuable, and moral.Read Post | Comments (954)Richard (RJ) Eskow, 01/10/13Writer; host, \u0027The Breakdown\u0027; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureThe job of treasury secretary is arguably the most important one the president will fill in his second term. It\u0027s certainly the choice that will most affect the American people\u0027s daily lives, future hopes, and aspirations.Read Post | Comments (49)Ben Hallman, 01/10/13Senior Financial Writer, The Huffington PostIt took awhile, but more than five years after a wave of failing subprime loans wrecked the American economy, regulators have instituted new rules that prevent lenders from offering prospective buyers the worst types of mortgages.Read Post | Comments (45)Bob Cesca, 01/09/13Political Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowYes, Chris Christie is a moderate on marriage equality. In a hardlined Republican crowd, that\u0027s rare. He\u0027s also acknowledged the man-made causes of the climate crisis. Good for him, but how screwy is it that we have to give credit to people who simply acknowledge scientific facts?Read Post | Comments (439)Kathleen Peddicord, 01/09/13Publisher, Live and Invest OverseasYou don\u0027t have to sell everything you own, say goodbye to everyone you\u0027ve ever known, and take off for a new life in some distant and exotic place, never to be heard from again. That\u0027s not the only way to realize the benefits of retiring overseas.Read Post | Comments (199)meQuilibrium, 01/10/13Personalized Stress ManagementTo anyone who is already reconsidering commitments related to diet, exercise, work, family time or \"me\" time, don\u0027t give up and certainly don\u0027t stress over them; you simply have to find that sweet spot somewhere between ambition and the impossible.Read Post | CommentsBill White, 01/10/13CEO, Constellations GroupAs an openly gay man, his words were then and remain regrettable, and all Americans deserve the explanation and apology that Chuck has succinctly and generously offered. I accept his apology, as a gay American and as his friend.Read Post | Comments (33)Paul Brandeis Raushenbush, 01/09/13Senior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostOn the day when the National Cathedral has announced that gay people can be married in its sanctuary, it seems discordant to invite someone to pray who is on the record as condemning gay people to hell.Read Post | Comments (375)Sen. Bernie Sanders, 01/09/13Independent U.S. Senator from VermontDespite such terminology as \"fiscal cliff\" and \"debt ceiling,\" the great debate taking place in Washington now has relatively little to do with financial issues. It is all about ideology. It is all about economic winners and losers in American society.Read Post | Comments (728)Rep. Barbara Lee, 01/09/13U.S. Representative, California\u0027s 13th congressional districtMost Americans realize that instead of spending billions of dollars extending our military presence in Afghanistan, we need to commit to a political settlement, bring all of our troops safely home and invest in jobs as well as nation-building here at home.Read Post | Comments (119)Arianna Huffington, 2013.11.01Amy Cuddy, 2013.11.01Cesar Millan, 2013.10.01Kristin McCracken, 2013.10.01Salvatore Bono, 2013.10.01Alan A.
