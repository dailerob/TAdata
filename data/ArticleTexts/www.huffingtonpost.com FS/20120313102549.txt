{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranThe counter-insurgency strategy in Afghanistan has failed, and it is time for President Obama to abandon it. In the wake of the horrific incident where a US soldier killed 16 innocent Afghans, and just weeks after American Marines were caught on tape desecrating the body of a dead enemy, and a pile of Korans were burned, that much is clear. It is time to employ a mission in Afghanistan that actually works, and leave a residual force in the region that focuses on destroying real threats to America. The sooner President Obama announces that, the better off our military and America will be.Read Post | Comments (116)George Lakoff, 03/12/12Author, The Political Mind, Moral Politics, Don\u0027t Think of an Elephant!The Republican presidential campaign is not just about the presidential race.

It\u0027s not called \"dumb luck\" for nothing.Read Post | Comments (76)Wendell Potter, 03/12/12Analyst at MSNBC and the Center for Public IntegrityIt is people who have decided not to buy coverage -- but who nevertheless get sick or injured and seek medical care when they do, even if they don\u0027t have the money to pay for it -- that make health insurance so expensive for the rest of us.Read Post | Comments (913)William Astore, 03/12/12Writer, Professor, Retired Lt. Colonel, Air ForceIf a nuclear-armed Iran is indeed the greatest threat we as a nation face, that is indeed good news. Even better: Our latest intelligence estimate suggests that Iran still doesn\u0027t have a nuclear weapon, nor is it clear whether its leaders have decided to build one.Read Post | Comments (28)Derek Hough, 03/12/12Dancer and choreographerIt\u0027s going to be tough.

In the meantime, for this to happen, I don\u0027t need President Obama to \"evolve\"; I need him to get reelected!Read Post | Comments (24)Geoffrey Dunn, 03/11/12Author, \u0027The Lies of Sarah Palin\u0027Few made-for-television movies have arrived with the amount of fanfare, anticipation and attendant hyperbole as has HBO\u0027s political docudrama Game Change.

The Religious Case for Equality\u0027No matter the scientific evidence, no matter the countless lives of happy, healthy LGBT people, there\u0027s that story, that binary, and that claim. Well, I\u0027d like to take that story back -- to reclaim it for all of us, not just those of us who find love in heterosexual, monogamous life.Read Post | Comments (72)Menachem Rosensaft, 03/12/12Professor of law and son of Holocaust survivorsSo who, precisely, is Peter Brimelow, and why should the rest of us be concerned when a white nationalist racist like him appears at the same event as Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum and Sarah Palin?Read Post | Comments (395)The Fat Diaries, 03/12/12Software Product ManagerI remember eating -- let\u0027s not be polite here -- I was STUFFING a second piece of cake in my mouth, drunk out of my skull. \"Jesus, that\u0027s good!\" I exclaimed to the Bar Mitzvah guests.

Robinson, 03/11/12Economic inequality will lead to greater political inequality, and those who are further empowered politically will use this to gain a greater economic advantage by stacking the cards in their favor -- a quintessential vicious circle.Read Post | Comments (345)Amy Tara Koch, 03/11/12Style expert, author, journalist, and all-around fashion aficionadoI am often mortified (post acquisition) at what I will/would/will endure to hunt and gather the objects of my affection.
