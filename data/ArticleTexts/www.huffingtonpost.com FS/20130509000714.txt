{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonJapan\u0027s spirit is being tested by the same recession and financial crisis afflicting all industrialized nations. But paradoxically, there are answers to be found to Japan\u0027s very modern crises in its most ancient traditions. There are shrines and temples and gardens everywhere. It is common to see monks meditating and easy to join them in meditation. And the latest twist is Buddhist temples using Zen meditation, cold-water ablutions and other traditional ceremonial practices to help young people looking for jobs! By taking its traditions and adapting them to solve new problems, by going both forward and backward, both outward and inward -- juxtapositions that in Japan don\u0027t have to be contradictions -- the people of Japan are poised find a new and vibrant balance for the 21st century.Comments (29)Chez PazienzaCo-host, \u0027The Bubble Genius Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027; writer, Deus Ex MalcontentFor a long time now I\u0027ve been saying this and, thanks to Sanford, I feel like I\u0027m getting a very nice little shot of pure validation at the moment: scandals don\u0027t last anymore.Comments (60)Carolyn S. MilesPresident \u0026 CEO, Save the ChildrenLet me tell you the stories of two mothers who are worlds apart, but share the worst thing that ever happened to them. Both Angela and Kismati still feel the loss of their baby every day, but I\u0027m inspired by the hope found amidst their stories, and within these brave women themselves.Comments (1)Eva LongoriaActress, Founder of the Eva Longoria FoundationAre maids a realistic reflection of Latinas in America today?? Yes, but they are not a reflection of every Latina. Stereotypes are constructed and perpetuated by those who believe in them. I choose not to.Comments (78)Arianna HuffingtonSunday is Mother\u0027s Day, one of the year\u0027s high points of gratitude. So as we honor the mothers among us (and those no longer among us), there\u0027s no better time to tap into that gratitude and draw on the qualities that make mothers such a force for good -- their generosity, their nurturing, their unconditional love.CommentsIsiah Thomas and Na\u0027ilah Suad NasirCollege athletics, as it intersects with the educational and life outcomes of black male athletes, is in crisis. This crisis is evident in many ways, including the prevalence of once-aspiring professional black male athletes who end up with no degree, few job prospects, and used-up eligibility.Comments (74)Michael B. KeeganPresident, People for the American Way\"I am one imperfect man saved by God\u0027s grace,\" Mark Sanford proclaimed as he declared victory. What I would love to see, is if Sanford applied his new personal understanding of grace to his new role in government. Perhaps he could convince his party that a little grace would do it some good.CommentsChristopher HayesHost, \u0027All In with Chris Hayes\u0027About three hours before he was to die by lethal injection, the Mississippi Supreme Court decided, 8 to 1, that, \"It is therefore ordered that the motion to stay execution filed by Willie Jerome Manning is hereby granted pending further order of this court.\"Comments (53)Katie GoodmanAward-winning comic, actress, author, creative coach, and social activist; KatieGoodman.comHere are the latest episodes of Bench Warmers, the brand spankin\u0027 new web series from Katie Goodman and Soren Kisiel of Broad Comedy.CommentsMaggie Lamond SimoneNational Award-winning Columnist; AuthorI now look forward to the day when someone tells me I\u0027m just like my mother. And I\u0027m really hoping it will be her.CommentsSeema JilaniPhysician reporting from AfghanistanI don\u0027t need you to \"tolerate\" me. I don\u0027t want you to merely put up with my presence. All I ask, all I have ever asked, is to be treated as a human being, that bigoted jingoism is not injected into every minute facet my life, that there remains at least the illusion of decency.Comments (1,275)Lesley M. M. BlumeAuthor, journalist, contributing style editorAs we all know, nothing falls out of fashion like fashion. History has relegated thousands of adornments to the ash bin, from togas to bustles to turbans. Yet, somehow these \"glad rags\" always manage to stage comebacks, sneaking into our modern wardrobes in various guises.Comments (131)Seamus McKiernanAssociate Blog Editor, The Huffington PostWho doesn\u0027t agree that the victims deserve privacy, and the hero praise? But in the immediate wake of the disturbing story of kidnapping and abuse, why would McDonald\u0027s tweet about the story at all?Comments (102)Jim HillEntertainment journalist and Walt Disney Company expertBuilding on the success of Hogsmeade, Hogwarts Castle and the award-winning \"Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey\" attraction, Universal Orlando Resort and Warner Bros. Entertainment today announced an expansion of historic proportion.Comments (14)Peter DiamandisChairman/CEO, X PRIZE FoundationIf anyone has seen success and failure on a global stage, it\u0027s my friend Steve Forbes. I had the pleasure to get from Steve his top eight recommendations for success. Here they are, all great pearls of wisdom that you can apply immediately.CommentsSuze OrmanHost, \"The Suze Orman Show\"There are no money problems. There are people problems. Success is not how many zeroes your bank account has. It\u0027s about making the most of the life you have.Comments (89)Tracey StewartCreator, Moomah the MagazineI imagined how much better my life would be with my sister-wife Martha by my side. Our bed sheets ironed and folded into hospital corners; a perfectly labeled food pantry. Surely, these advantages would outweigh the awkwardness that might arise at bedtime.Comments (48)Mike LuxCo-Founder, Democracy PartnersPresident Obama has waited too long. The president could help those 2,000,000 low-wage workers working for government contractors with an executive order, and for over four years now, he has refused to act.CommentsClaire Bidwell SmithLos Angeles-based grief therapist and author of the memoir \u0027The Rules of Inheritance\u0027When I tuck my girls into bed at night, when I smooth Vera\u0027s hair away from her forehead when she has a fever, or scoop Juliette into my arms after a tumble, my heart spilling over for them, I often find myself breathless with the realization of just how much my mother loved me.CommentsInternational Rescue CommitteeA Global Leader in Humanitarian AssistanceThe women in Congo have always been the backbone of the country. Yet traditionally they have not been granted a voice. Today, though the process may be slow and sporadic, things are changing.CommentsMika BrzezinskiCo-host of MSNBC’s \"Morning Joe\"This is the book I have been afraid to write . . . terrified actually. It deals with an issue that is radioactive for me. How I eat, diet, and look has tied me up in knots my entire life, and I know I am not alone.Comments (94)Brian K. Pinaire, Ph.D.Associate Professor of Political Science, Lehigh UniversityThe president reviews the superlatives of the graduating class. One student patented a way to make shoes out of used tea bags; another was involved in brokering a Kardashian Twitter truce; and, yet another was at work on the unabridged history of the Falkland Islands. It is all so inspiring.CommentsKristin Kirkpatrick, M.S., R.D., L.D.Manager of Wellness Nutrition Services at Cleveland Clinic Wellness InstitutePeople automatically associate a vegetarian or vegan diet with health, but in reality, eliminating meat from the diet is not necessarily a ticket to good health. In fact, it\u0027s just as easy to be an unhealthy vegetarian as it is to be an unhealthy omnivore.Comments (216)Alec BaldwinActorI have not acted in a legit show on Broadway since A Streetcar Named Desire in 1992, having chosen the not-for-profit route on Broadway or regional for my last four shows. Broadway has changed in the past 21 years and I wanted take a moment to look at that.Comments (159)Carol OrsbornFounder, Fierce with Age, the Digest of Boomer WisdomI used to be \u0027mommy.\u0027 Now I\u0027m not. While my adult children love me dearly, I am clearly something other than the identity that defined me over much of the past six decades. But that\u0027s not all. I also used to be \u0027Carol Orsborn.\u0027 Now I\u0027m not that either.Comments (12)Jeff DanzigerPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideComments (65)ZanaAfricaNonprofit creating access to affordable sanitary pads and health educationWhat would you do if you didn\u0027t have pads (or tampons)? Or, what would you choose not to do for fear of embarrassment?Comments (13)Rana FloridaCEO, The Creative Class Group \u0026 Author, UpgradeSan Antonio-born, Princeton-educated business consultant, entrepreneur, and artist Robert Hammond has lived in Manhattan\u0027s West Village for several years. Near his apartment was a stretch of the old elevated New York Central Railroad tracks, which had been abandoned since the early 1980\u0027s.CommentsPierce BrosnanActorThe U.S. Navy has new plans for testing and training exercises with sonar and explosives -- and those plans spell disaster for whales. Now is the time for concerned citizens to come to their defense.Comments (14)Ann BrenoffSenior Writer, The Huffington PostTeenagers don\u0027t listen anyway, right? Maybe it\u0027s a good thing because the advice we offer them is probably time-warped flawed. When I think back to all the things my mother used to say to me five decades ago, only one kernel still rings of the truth. It was when she said, \u0027You need to make your own mistakes. Just please try not to make the same ones I did.\u0027Comments (106)Ann CurryNBC News National and International CorrespondentAs a journalist, I\u0027ve had the opportunity to meet with mothers around the world who are facing tough challenges in war zones and remote areas without access to medical care for themselves and their children. This is unacceptable.CommentsMarlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistI\u0027d just graduated from the University of Southern California, and even though I knew I wanted to go into show business, I tried my hand at teaching for a while -- partly because my father wanted me to get a \"real job,\" but mostly because I loved it.Comments (41)Ellen Dolgen, 2013. 8.05Jennifer Owens, 2013. 8.05Lisa Wade, 2013. 8.05Mary T.
