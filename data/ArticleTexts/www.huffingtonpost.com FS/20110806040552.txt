The president will never stop fighting on their behalf. I could not be prouder to be a part of his team.Read Post | CommentsSen. Bernie Sanders, 8/5/11Independent U.S. Senator from VermontThe deficit deal does exactly the opposite of what the American people wanted.

Jones, 8/5/11Scholar in Residence, Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute at Stanford UniversityA birthday present for the president would be for his speech writers to review some of their ridiculous use of the English language to convey the appropriate political message of the president.Read Post | CommentsRobert Reich, 8/5/11Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Aftershock\u0027Now that we\u0027re slouching toward a double-dip recession, the only hope is voters will tell their members of Congress to stop obsessing about future budget deficits and get to work on the real crisis of unemployment, falling wages, and no growth.Read Post | CommentsPaul Rieckhoff, 8/5/11Executive Director and Founder, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America12.4 percent of Iraq and Afghanistan vets are unemployed as of July. In real numbers, that\u0027s 232,000 new veterans struggling to find work.

Goodman, 8/5/11Business Editor, The Huffington PostThe latest jobs report changes nothing. We had no engine of economic growth when we all woke up on Friday morning, and we still don\u0027t have one.
