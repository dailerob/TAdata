President, Writers Guild of America, East.With just a few weeks until they adjourn for the holidays, Republicans in the US Congress will try to cram in as much pettiness and vituperation as they can before heading back to their states and districts, no doubt to lead the home front in the fight against \"the war on Christmas\" launched this time every year by Fox News and its shock troops on talk radio. Take a look at some of their plans, including the riders congressional Republicans are contemplating for inclusion in the omnibus spending bill that must be passed by December 11. The whole mess is a Bad Santa\u0027s list of loopholes benefiting High Finance, tax cuts for the rich, and budget cuts for everyone else, even as they drive the nation deeper into debt and disrepair.Muslims denounce both terrorism and radical Islam. \"Moderate\" is a misleading modifier for a religion that rejects the killing of innocent people, women and children, old people, and those fleeing combat. And the Quran is clear: there is no compulsion in matters of religion.Brooks College and Kaufman Interfaith Institute, Grand Valley State University\"Our No. 1 goal for the next year is to put together a complete alternative to the left\u0027s agenda,\" said Paul Ryan as he unveiled his agenda. Despite the speech\u0027s sweeping oratory and careful stagecraft, Ryan clings to seven dumb ideas that are also cropping up among Republican presidential candidates.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027There are family obligations at the holidays, but not every obligation need be met, especially if they cause sadness, resentment, or regret. Whether or not you have someone in your life struggling with mental illness, you\u0027re only as helpful as you are healthy yourself.Author, research psychologist and gender scholar\"Thoughts and prayers\" are not solutions for the 30,000 people who will be killed by a gun this year -- we need sensible gun safety legislation NOW.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersI remember asking the guy documenting casualties about the number of wounded and finding out it had reached 46, all women and children. I was stunned. For the first time ever, there was not a single man among those injured during an air strike.We are non-violent Syrian activists campaigning to engage people around the world in solidarity to stop the violence and extremism in Syria.Justice -- of sorts -- was finally delivered as Donald Blankenship, the former Chairman and CEO of Massey Energy, was convicted of conspiring to willfully violate mine safety standards at the Upper Branch Mine in West Virginia, where 29 workers died in April 2010. Here\u0027s a blog I wrote about it a few months after the disaster.Instead of asking, or even begging, corporations and countries to please reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in Paris, we would like to follow The Pope\u0027s lead and suggest that there is a simpler, more effective and more just way to deal with the existential threat facing life on this planet.Composer, singer, actor and activistCommunication Strategist, Author of \"Words That Shook The World\"Democratic Senator from Rhode IslandSinger and songwriterWhile soft spots remain in the job market and we are not at full employment, we are clearly on that path, as payrolls have settled into a steady growth groove, slightly north of 200,000 per month.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorWhile I was never a party animal anyways, completely stopping with alcohol made me go out even less. It\u0027s amazing to see the culture of drinking slowly fading away from your life. It made me realize how many friendships are actually based mostly on your drinking habits.Designer \u0026 Maker. Former Design Lead, SpotifyPrayer alone cannot fix these troubled and dangerous times. Nor can prayer be used by politicians -- or any of us -- to excuse inaction or to demonstrate one\u0027s compassion, while continuing to support gun policies that will only allow more shootings.President, Auburn Theological SeminaryWe cannot be sure what would happen after a U.S. pull-out. But we know that ISIS needs us. Without the American presence, it loses its ability to market itself as the Islamic champion against the Western neo-crusaders. The anti-war movement is long overdue.Jeff Faux, author of The Servant EconomyGun ownership isn\u0027t some inalienable right granted by God. Remember, the Constitution was written by men coming out of a long and bloody war near the end of the 18th century. It was written for their time. It also included the \"right\" to own a human being. Things change.Comedian; author of \"DC Trip\" (Adaptive Books)On November 24, 2015 the General Assembly of the United Nations passed six anti-Israeli resolutions -- in one day. Some of them relate to issues that should be addressed: Occupation, settlement building, Palestinian rights, peace. But the text of each and every one is outrageous.Author, \u0027My Promised Land: The Triumph and Tragedy of Israel\u0027It turns out that Sanders does have a detailed corporate tax plan to pay for his infrastructure plan. He introduced the plan as a Senate bill shortly before announcing his run for the Democratic nomination for President. It is called the Corporate Tax Dodging Prevention Act.Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureNot a single Syrian has been at the negotiating table -- despite repeated assurances that any future transition would be Syria-led and Syrian-owned. We want protection from the barrel bombs, cluster munitions and chemical weapons that suffocate, maim and kill our children. Unless the participants at Vienna recognize and act on our calls for civilian protection, talks will lack legitimacy and will not secure peace.Coalition of Syrian civil society groups, inside and outside SyriaIn between consultations, the doctor comes out, smiles and makes jokes with the children. \"The biggest problem for them is the lack of safe places to play, and the lack of toys, which families often can\u0027t afford. \"President of Un Ponte PerThe recent shooting of a Venezuela opposition politician and its aftermath are worth examining because it provides a compelling example of how international media has been manipulated, for over 15 years, to portray Venezuela in a way that conforms to U.S. foreign policy objectives.Co-director, Center for Economic and Policy Research, Washington, D.C.Gun violence, Islamic terrorism, and anti-Muslim bigotry are all real, serious problems that need to be faced head-on. It\u0027s disingenuous to be in denial about one or the other just because you have a certain political affiliation.Pakistani-Canadian writer, physician and musicianLakeshore Records digitally releases Brooklyn: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack today, December 4th. The classic track is performed by music coordinator John Carty with James Blennerhassettt, Paul Gurney and Jim Higgins.Trafficbeat Entertainment, Music Biz VetYou can just decide that beauty isn\u0027t important. And when you do, it\u0027s OK that some days you just cannot be positive. Some days you can just live in your body and give yourself space to be not ok at all. It\u0027s completely ok to look in the mirror and be sad that your stomach is a curtain for your pubic hair.Feminist, body positive, wife, mom of five, Editor In Chief at ravishly.com, (sometimes) RN.I am a Christian and an American, but I refuse to settle for this American Christianity any longer or be defined by it. I know that there is something much greater beyond it worth heading toward; something that looks more like God and feels more like love.Pastor and WriterThe Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, LLC, is more a symptom of our zeitgeist than a snubbing of philanthropy. In terms of effectiveness, an LLC is arguably a better choice than a nonprofit to mobilize on all fronts.Former founder and VCIf you\u0027re hurting like I am right now, thinking about the epidemic of gun violence in this country, but you have not yet contacted your elected representatives to make your voice heard, it\u0027s time. This is our country, and elected officials work for us. Don\u0027t go down without a fight.Writer and comedianDilma Rousseff is a disaster, that\u0027s a fact. She will have her name inscribed among the most mediocre presidents in Brazil\u0027s history. But there are two things that concern me about the idea of her impeachment.Economics professor at the School of Economics, Business and Accounting of the University of São PauloRussia\u0027s presence in Syria has little to do with fighting ISIS and everything to do with propping up the regime of Bashar al-Assad. More international forces getting directly involved in the fighting on Syrian soil is complicating and prolonging the Syrian conflict whilst civilians continue to suffer.A global advocacy group standing in solidarity with non-violent Syrians and their struggle for a peaceful and dignified future.Yesterday\u0027s massacre in San Bernardino again underscores the ineffectiveness of relying upon bulk data collection and intelligence agencies\u0027 watch-listing processes to \"keep us safe from terrorism.\"Former FBI Special AgentMy thoughts are more constructed and meaningful. My delivery becomes more authentic, poignant and relevant as a result. My confidence is strong and secure. I am patient. I didn\u0027t change -- I sloughed off the things that changed me, and it revealed more of what makes me who I am.Director, Product Design at FacebookAny U.S. citizen who believes there is not a serious problem in the U.S. Armed Forces with fundamentalist, evangelical Christianity, must be, as I often remark to my students when I describe some particularly egregious and otherwise inexplicable failing, \"smoking some good stuff.\"Colonel, U.S. Army (Retired)I have seen first-hand how paternity leave policies can be undermined by supervisors who don\u0027t value fatherhood. The law is clear: Many new fathers have a right to unpaid leave.Founder, The Spiggle Law FirmI know how tired you are. I know how exhausting it is to hold the weight of an entire faith and group of people, regardless of whether or not the actions of a few are not part of the faith you love so dearly.Muslim ActivistGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
