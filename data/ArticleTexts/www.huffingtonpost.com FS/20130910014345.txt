{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonLast week a few HuffPost editors and I were treated to a visit by Bill Drayton and Mary Gordon. Bill Drayton is the founder of Ashoka and a longtime champion of social entrepreneurship, a term that he coined and that has now spread across the world. Mary Gordon is a former kindergarten teacher who founded Roots of Empathy, an organization dedicated to teaching emotional literacy and promoting empathy in children. As Mary told us, empathy is a two-way street and is best nurtured by example. Philosophers have known this for centuries. \"No one can live happily who has regard for himself alone and transforms everything into a question of his own utility,\" wrote the first-century Stoic philosopher Seneca. And in practically every religious tradition and practice, giving of oneself is a key step on the path to spiritual fulfillment.CommentsRobert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027For decades, you could always count on the Federal Reserve to pull the plug on prosperity too soon, seeing ghosts of inflation everywhere. The Fed, responsive as it was to creditors, preferred a dose of recession to any sort of price pressures, especially wage increases. That changed with the regimes of Fed chairmen Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke.Comments (307)Peter Alexander MeyersPolitical theorist and author of \u0027Civic War and the Corruption of the Citizen\u0027President Obama\u0027s call for military intervention is compelling because, as he said, \"the moral thing to do is not to stand by and do nothing.\" This moral claim is misleading. Although government may pursue humanitarian goals, it is not a humanitarian agency.Comments (18)Maureen RyanTV critic, The Huffington PostWE HAVE TO WAIT A WEEK TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS NEXT!?Comments (891)Christopher T. Gates and Nick PennimanAddressing this core dysfunction of our democracy is about as all-American a cause as you can find in today\u0027s polarized political environment. And it is due time for all of us to come together and fix it.Comments (22)Dennis J. KucinichFmr. 16-year Member of US Congress; Two-time US Presidential CandidateWe\u0027ve seen this movie before and it doesn\u0027t end well. A decade after the Bush administration used the CIA\u0027s \"yellow cake\" tale and other faulty evidence, the government is yet again relying on the CIA to lead a domestic propaganda effort for military action in Syria.Comments (187)Maggie JacksonAward-winning Journalist, Author of \"Distracted\"While briefly using my daughter\u0027s laptop, I was taken aback to see slightly off-target word suggestions flashing above my prose -- the work of her school software. How often had an algorithm\u0027s choice eclipsed a moment of potential student musing?Comments (12)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027We are paralyzed at home -- as we turn our attention to a potential quagmire abroad. This is the great tragedy of our time.Comments (435)Dr Mark WilliamsonDirector of Action for HappinessPeople\u0027s daily experiences and concerns differ enormously around the world. While a farmer in Angola prays for a good harvest, a manager in Greece worries about losing her job. And while a mother in Egypt comes to terms with life in a conflict zone, a doctor in Denmark struggles with work-related stress.CommentsJeffrey LaurentiInternational affairs analyst and commentatorPerhaps the administration conceives air strikes as the lever to push the Syrian resistance to the long-promised negotiating table with Assad\u0027s government. But even if this is the game plan, the administration should be laying the groundwork now.CommentsKathleen ReardonProfessor, USC Marshall School; Author, \u0027The Secret Handshake\u0027 and \u0027Shadow Campus\u0027How does a top business graduate school level the playing field for women? How does it retain female faculty in a culture that the university admits has been unwelcoming to women?CommentsAnne-Marie SlaughterBert G. Kerstetter \u002766 University Professor of Politics and International Affairs, Princeton UniversityThere is tremendous potential for an Israeli-Palestinian-Jordanian economic zone that would drive the entire region\u0027s growth and development.Comments (16)Leo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersCapitalist theory asserts that CEOs rise to the top based on merit and moxie and deserve million-dollar pay packages. Turns out, though, capitalism doesn\u0027t really work that way. Conniving Jonnies rule the business world.Comments (152)John PavleyCTO @ The Huffington Post, BloggerOne way to really understand someone is to look at the books on their bookshelf. Here\u0027s a picture of mine and it\u0027s a picture of my soul.CommentsLisa BelkinSenior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, The Huffington PostIt’s hard to give up a superpower. It’s like The Little Mermaid giving up her voice for love -- only the other way around because instead of getting the guy, I’m letting him go.CommentsMatthew DowdPolitical strategistIgnore the communications folks. This isn\u0027t a marketing problem. It is a substantive policy problem and it is about rebuilding trust through actions and not words.CommentsDiane RavitchHistorian, NYU professorWhat bothers Bloomberg is that de Blasio may well be his successor and has shown no deference to Bloomberg. In fact, he has been the mayor\u0027s sharpest critic. What an insult to Bloomberg!Comments (16)Carl PopeFormer executive director and chairman, Sierra ClubForty years ago in October the first oil embargo taught the U.S. a lesson -- an economy dependent on a single fuel, oil, for its entire transportation system -- is fatally flawed. Yet this is a lesson we seem resolutely determined to forget.Comments (15)James CostosU.S. Ambassador Designate to SpainI am deeply committed to furthering the economic and foreign policies of the country we love.CommentsJeffrey SachsDirector, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \"To Move the World: JFK\u0027s Quest for Peace\"The world would be much happier if governments understood that their real purpose is not to feather the nests of the politicians, nor to serve the lobbying groups, but to promote the well-being of their citizens. Governments that take that perspective have lots of tools at their disposal.Comments (39)Mike Hogan and Christopher RosenIs 12 Years A Slave the absolute best movie to come out in years and a future source of oxygen? I certainly hope so! Yet, as we know, the best film often doesn\u0027t win Best Picture.CommentsJennifer BallMom, writer, teacher, lover of dirty martinis and yoga pantsWomen like me didn\u0027t make an agonizing choice between a high-paying, satisfying career and motherhood. Women like me, we basically went from friends to parenthood. Some of us have degrees, some of us never finished college. Some of us never started.Comments (437)Tim FerrissAuthor, \u0027The 4-Hour Workweek\u0027San Francisco is my favorite city in the world, bar none. I love NYC, I love Bali, and I love Buenos Aires, but SF is the place for me. And since I\u0027ve been here for 10 years, I get asked a lot: what should I do when I visit?CommentsFrank MannionAward-winning Irish movie producer and distributorThe Venice Film Festival usually produces a couple of films that go on to Oscar glory. In the past it has been the launchpad for Academy darlings, Brokeback Mountain, Black Swan and The Wrestler.CommentsNaomi Kehati BronnerClinical psychologistThe jungle of relationships in which we all live is filled with opportunities to feel incompetent, unworthy, flawed and wronged. But when such a troubled and chronic dynamic evolves between two people at home or work, both make it possible.CommentsTom ChatfieldBritish writer and commentatorFor some, the right kind of play can spell the difference between becoming part of something, and the lifelong feeling that they\u0027re not meant to take part. Why is this?Comments (20)Amb. Marc GinsbergFmr. U.S. Ambassador to Morocco \u0026 White House Middle East AdviserWhat exactly can Syria do in retaliation? Actually, it\u0027s not what Assad will do. His military can\u0027t even beat the ragtag rebels arrayed against him. Rather, it\u0027s what his proxies may do... and that is where we should be focused on.CommentsJessica JosephAward-winning copywriterMothers, tanties and teachers: It breaks my heart to tell you this but you unknowingly slipped something toxic in your home-cooked chicken soup for the soul and fed it to your daughters and granddaughters. You told us that in order to enter woman-hood and embrace all the beauty that comes with it, we must undergo a painful rite of passage called the chemical relaxer, perm or hot comb.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorIt\u0027s now pretty well understood that of the two ways you can reduce unemployment, we got the bad one today. That is, the jobless rate can fall because more jobseekers land jobs -- good; or because they give up looking -- bad.Comments (195)Raymond J. LearsyAuthor, \u0027Ruminations on the Distortion of Oil Prices and Crony Capitalism\u0027Over the last weeks, since the inception of the demonstrations in Egypt for president Morsi\u0027s ouster, to the sarin gassing of innocents in Syria these past days, the price of oil has skyrocketed. After Saudi Arabia, the most immediate beneficiary of this spiking of oil prices is Russia.CommentsDoug BandowSenior Fellow, the Cato InstituteThe president has placed the decision whether to go to war where it belongs, with Congress. Legislators should act on behalf of the American people, not the Obama administration. And the right decision is to keep the U.S. at peace.Comments (402)Irene Aldridge, 2013. 9.09Chris Weigant, 2013. 9.09Mark Horvath, 2013. 9.09Brandon J.
