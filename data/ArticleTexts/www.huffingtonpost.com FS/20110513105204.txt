{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Christian leader for social changeAfter 10 long years, the national conversation on the war in Afghanistan has changed significantly. And now, the hunt for Osama bin Laden, used for years to justify the war, is over. The official reasons for continuing the war are disappearing each day. The threat of al Qaeda in Afghanistan has significantly weakened. Many people are shocked when they learn that there are only 100 al Qaeda operatives left in Afghanistan, but more than 100,000 American troops remain. As the debate on the deficit heats up, every American should know these numbers: 100 terrorists; 100,000 troops; $100 billion per year -- it just isn\u0027t adding up anymore.Read Post | CommentsWilliam J.

Our opponent is not terrorism but the divisions between us.Read Post | CommentsMarshall Auerback, 05.12.2011Roosevelt Institute Senior FellowMany financial institutions are hopelessly insolvent, holding mountains of toxic waste that will never be worth anything.

And unlike the natural disasters we can do something to stop it.Read Post | CommentsSam Harris, 05.12.2011Author, NeuroscientistNot all contemplative paths kindle the same doubts or present the same liabilities.

Tom Carper, 05.12.2011U.S. Senator from DelawareMaking across-the-board cuts to government programs to lower the deficit is tempting, but it won\u0027t foster the economic growth needed to realize our deficit reduction goals.Read Post | CommentsPatrick Sharma, 05.12.2011Bancroft Fellow in history and public policy, UC BerkeleySince being introduced to help cope with the Great Depression, farm subsidies have devolved into a hodgepodge of price supports, direct payments, insurance programs, tax loopholes and low-interest loans for wealthy farmers and agribusiness.Read Post | CommentsJoanne Bamberger, 05.12.2011PunditMom, Author, Mothers of Intention: How Women \u0026 Social Media are Revolutionizing Politics in AmericaGingrich is a man who doesn\u0027t worry about inconsistent visuals because the 1990s political bad boy is now all about religion and redemption, at least when it\u0027s his own.
