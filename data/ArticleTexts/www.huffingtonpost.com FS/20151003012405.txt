{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Executive Vice President, The Peace AllianceIt feels as though there is a gaping hole in our nation\u0027s soul. It is time we take a serious look at the epidemic of violence in America, and begin to implement real solutions; they are out there. It\u0027s hard to deny that easy access to guns, especially semi-automatics, play a serious role in these mass shooting tragedies in the U.S. How many mass school shootings happen in nations with strict controls on guns? How many mass school shootings happen in the United Kingdom, Australia or Canada each year? None. And yet, our mass shootings in the U.S. continue to rack up. There is certainly a correlation. But there are other important causes at play as well. We must develop social structures and comprehensive strategies that can help bring healing to our communities and build resilience in our society. Can we really afford to wait any longer to do so?If you\u0027ve been entrusted with raising children in a society that is measurably not as safe as it should be, why wouldn\u0027t you want to seek ways to make it a better place? I\u0027m not telling my child, the most precious gem of my universe, that there is nothing to be done and that I won\u0027t even try. You shouldn\u0027t either.Playwright and Author, \u0027Homo Domesticus: Notes from a Same-Sex Marriage\u0027I know how gun owners feel about their guns because I\u0027ve known a lot of them, and most have been rational, educated and caring people, many with school-aged kids. So, why haven\u0027t these gun owners been moved enough by the killings of school children to join efforts to stop the carnage?Instructor, Michigan State University\u0027s School of Journalism. Previously infographics director at Newsweek and The Associated Press. All ideas are my own.Until politicians in the U.S. are prepared to risk their own political scalp, stand up to the powerful gun lobby and even anger their own voting base to limit the general public\u0027s access to certain types of weapons, America will continue to drown in gun blood.Writer and Director of Public Affairs at the NSW Minerals CouncilAfter thousands of mass shootings in the last 15 years with no action, now is as good a time as any for those of us in favor of sensible gun laws to reconsider our place in this situation, too. Massacres, and the response from all sides and all parties, has become routine. The sense of urgency is gone. Time to get it back.Public Relations Consultant, www.winningprogressive.comRecently released data from the U.S. Census Bureau\u0027s Current Population Survey show the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is working and helping get people health coverage. This is a welcome stark contrast to new census data showing children remain our poorest age group and the younger they are the poorer they are.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundIt is strange to watch the Republican Presidential debates or hear the candidates describe our country. While there is hype in political rhetoric, now there are outright falsehoods being peddled as facts.Singer; Actress; Director; Composer; ActivistTimes are hard in today\u0027s Russia. At some point, Russians will expect their powerful leader to deliver better times at home. To delay that day of judgment a little longer, Putin needs victories -- particularly those that burnish Russia\u0027s image as a world power. Once again, he\u0027s getting them. For now, he\u0027s on a roll -- and an international force to be reckoned with.President, Eurasia Group; Author, \u0027Superpower: Three Choices for America’s Role in the World\u0027The nation\u0027s payrolls rose by only 142,000 last month, and job gains for July and August were revised down by 59,000, suggesting the pace of job growth has slowed in recent months. Analysts were expecting job growth of around 200,000, and the question is how much should it change our views about underlying labor market conditions?Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorI am a librarian and academic library director and an ardent supporter of free speech and democracy, but in 2012 I banned a book at Mansfield University of Pennsylvania.Independent source of news and analysis, from the academic and research community.I hugged the young woman and told her to keep up the fight and let her light shine, and promised her that I would make sure that it did. Join me in being the voice of change and end the silence. Share your story of your personal path from addiction to recovery or celebrate a loved one who has. It\u0027s time.Cardiac Surgeon and Host of the Emmy-Award Winning \u0027The Dr. Oz Show\u0027That mass shootings have become so common that our reaction as a nation has, as the President said, \"become routine,\" is grotesque. That we stand alone among Western industrialized nations in our tolerance of such carnage is shameful.Executive Director, Violence Policy CenterThe Washington Post just ran an attack on Bernie Sanders that distorts not only what he\u0027s saying and seeking but also the basic choices that lie before the nation.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The pope, according to the Vatican\u0027s clarification, knew little of the particulars of her story. It appears it was not a private meeting to endorse her. A Vatican spokesman even described it as not \"a real audience\" -- quite an insult to Davis -- unlike some of the pope\u0027s other meetings.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostCalifornia is rightly regarded as a progressive beacon. But in this reliably blue, profoundly innovative state, we have witnessed the growth of a massive, inhumane and costly incarceration system. Worst still, people of color bear the brunt of this broken system.President, Dream Corps Unlimited; Author of NY Times bestseller, \u0027The Green-Collar Economy\u0027We have little time to argue over the man or one individual, when our people are dying every day, at the hands of our system or at the hands of each other.Founder, GlobalGrind.comMaybe for a time before dying, a very small time, Bryce Williams\u0027s swirling anger, Chris Harper Mercer\u0027s swirling anger, stopped swirling. Perhaps, at long last, they felt sated. How relatively pitiful the causes of their anger; how incomparably grievous the consequences.Columnist, 3L at Harvard LawHow bad would things have to get for you to spend all of your money so your family could cram into a flimsy, rubber boat with 40 other people? How bad would things have to get before you actually felt lucky to get a spot on that boat?Actor and ProducerIt was with great sadness that many throughout Indian country watched last Wednesday\u0027s canonization of Junípero Serra. Billed as a historic moment in which the pope elevated the first Hispanic priest to sainthood on U.S. soil; Serra\u0027s controversial background was largely overlooked.citizen of Couchiching First Nation, tribal rights attorney, notyourmascots.org co-founderEach of us has different goals and dreams that will make us happy, but what we all desire is freedom. We long to live life on our terms and spend our time on the things that are important to us. Here are five signs you\u0027re not living a life that makes you happy and gives you freedom.Author, Freedom Advocate, Tips to create freedom at KimanziConstable.comWhat we aren\u0027t hearing is that Americans, for many more years and with greater intensity than inhabitants of other countries, have been groped and goosed and pummeled by a sophisticated, multi-trillion dollar drive to short-circuit deliberation and dialogue in order to spur the self-centered impulse buying that is ruining our civil society.Lecturer in Political Science, Yale UniversityPaper makes reading physically pleasurable. Reading an e-book, on the other hand, feels like using an ATM. And after staring at a computer screen at work all day, how relaxing is it to curl up at home and stare at another screen?Journal of Books and IdeasWhether we are working together as employers and employees, fellow team members, or husband and wife, our effectiveness depends on the integrity with which we exchange requests and promises that allow us to coordinate our actions.Founder and Chairman, Conscious Business Center InternationalSince my GOP friends don\u0027t seem to understand how an OB-GYN appointment actually works, let me explain: Planned Parenthood and other primary care providers offer life-saving breast cancer screenings.Senior Member of the Senate Foreign Relations CommitteeThe media\u0027s focus in the Ahmed Mohamed story has been on Obama\u0027s invitation to the teenager to visit the White House. But the response is symptomatic of what America is prone to do: turn these kind of stories into a greeting card -- \"Sorry you were profiled. Know that you are precious.\" That\u0027s just not enough anymore.Doctoral student in Political Science at the Berlin Graduate School Muslim Cultures and SocietiesHearing the gospel preached every day with such eloquence and power -- while seeing it lived with such authenticity and integrity -- showed me how far I fall short of the things I most dearly and deeply believe.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersThe greatest threat to Japan\u0027s security at the moment is not China or North Korea, it is the nation\u0027s public debt, which has surpassed one quadrillion yen ($10.46 trillion).Editor in Chief, The Huffington Post JapanWe are being terrorized -- but not by the shooters. Instead, it\u0027s the gun lobby and the cowardly politicians throughout our country. Politicians at the state and federal level don\u0027t have the courage to step up and stand up for our children, our friends and our neighbors. It\u0027s time for us to stop looking to them for direction.Professor of Higher Education, University of Pennsylvania\u0027s Graduate School of EducationAs a proven investor who has created hundreds of billions in value for his shareholders since 1965, Warren Buffett has delivered the most spectacular performance of any investor in modern history. Yet remarkably, Buffett has no qualms about sharing the \"secrets\" to his success.Senior Fellow, Harvard Business SchoolWhen I was entering my sophomore year, I piled up my schedule with everything there was. Not only was I taking a heavy course load, I was also in two shows, and trying to work outside of school. In addition, within the first couple of weeks, one of my good friends went through a major life trauma. I wanted to be there for her as much as possible.ActressIt has happened again.
