{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Author, \u0027Framing The Debate\u0027 and \u0027Outright Barbarous\u0027Watching the GOP rock-show pyrotechnics shoot up at the prospect of Chris Christie running for president, keen observers may have noticed a remarkable transformation taking place in American politics. Republicans have injected so much ginned-up lab-tested indignation into their campaigns that their nomination contest looks more like a professional wrestling road show than a civic debate about America\u0027s future. It would all be fun and games except for one tiny, albeit significant fact: this approach threatens to derail America\u0027s economic future. This country needs a real debate about the economy based on facts, not an arena spectacle.Read Post | CommentsVan Jones, 9/30/11President of RebuildtheDream.com and author of NY Times bestseller, \"The Green-Collar Economy\"Wall Street has long been the home of the biggest threat to American Democracy. Now it has become home to what may be our best hope for rescuing it.Read Post | CommentsMargie Omero, 9/30/11Democratic pollster, president of Momentum AnalysisRepublicans feel they\u0027ve seized a winning talking point by labeling as \"class warfare\" Obama\u0027s plan to ask the wealthiest to pay a bit more in taxes. Is that label sticking? And does it hurt?Read Post | CommentsLawrence Lessig and David Segal, 9/30/11Most Americans can surely agree that Congress, as much as possible, should be unconstrained by incentives that compel it to behave differently than would a representative sample of Americans, coming together to try to do what\u0027s best for our country.Read Post | CommentsJoanna Zelman, 9/30/11Green Editor, The Huffington PostI\u0027m excited to announce the launch of HuffPost reporter Lynne Peeples\u0027 series, The Infection Loop, which, along the lines of the growing movement \"One Health,\" will examine the link between humans, animals, and the environment.Read Post | CommentsJason Linkins, 9/30/11Editor, Eat the PressFor a few crazy minutes today, the Internet blew up with news that a few conservative activists want Mike Huckabee to consider entering the GOP 2012 fray. So what does this mean for your life and those of your loved ones? Probably not much.Read Post | CommentsRobert Reich, 9/30/11Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Aftershock\u0027When charged with promoting \"class warfare,\" Obama recently answered it was \"just math.\" But it\u0027s more than math. It\u0027s a matter of morality. Republicans have posed the deepest moral question of any society: whether we\u0027re all in it together. Their answer is we\u0027re not.Read Post | CommentsDavid Sloan Wilson, 9/30/11Author, \u0027The Neighborhood Project: Using Evolution to Improve My City, One Block at a Time\u0027; Editor-in-Chief, Evolution: This View of LifeA flurry of recent activity indicates that evolution is beginning to occupy center stage in economic debates--and not a moment too soon.Read Post | CommentsRoya Boroumand, 9/30/11Executive director, Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation.What determines political developments in a closed country does not necessarily happen in front of the cameras with tanks rolling over protesters.

Yet, his whole shtick leaves me cold. Just because a leader can curse is not a reason to vote for him. And I\u0027m not the only woman who feels this way.Read Post | CommentsDan Froomkin, 9/30/11Senior Washington Correspondent, Huffington PostWhen Bernie Sanders leaked confidential data last month that dramatically illustrated how speculators were dominating the oil futures market during the 2008 spike in oil prices, many news outlets jumped on the story in the worst possible way.Read Post | CommentsBrian Levin, J.D., 9/30/11Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityWith the death of al Awalki, the plotting of attacks and the Internet recruitment effort directed toward Western youth by radicals has suffered a significant blow, but the threat by no means has been completely eliminated.Read Post | CommentsMichael Zimmerman, Ph.D., 9/30/11Founder, The Clergy Letter ProjectPerhaps those godless experts at Christian colleges aren\u0027t godless at all.
