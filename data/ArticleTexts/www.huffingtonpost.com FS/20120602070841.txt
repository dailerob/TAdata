{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"ActorI think Mayor Michael Bloomberg is right. At least in spirit. Food is a drug in the way it is marketed today, which is significantly different from when I grew up. As a child, sweets were referred to as \"treats,\" and were dispensed far more judiciously than they are today. Now, Americans are obese, and in some areas of high concentration, morbidly obese, in numbers that are sapping the treasuries of the fifty states, undercutting U.S. competitiveness, and leaving this country vulnerable to a set of long-term health crises that we will struggle to overcome, if ever.
