{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThe themes and ideas that make up what we call The Third Metric -- redefining success beyond money and power to include things like well-being, wisdom, wonder, and giving back -- are resonating at every social and economic level, as more and more people are realizing the need for a more humane and sustainable way of doing business. Here at HuffPost, we have started the conversation that will help people change habits and change lives. We know we all agree on the broad issues, but knowing something intellectually is different than embracing it emotionally -- and, most importantly, acting on that knowledge. So, to give those of you who weren\u0027t at our Third Metric conference last week a taste of what was being said by some of the women and men who are already redefining success, I wanted to share a collection of some of my favorite quotes.CommentsTheo JansenArtistIn my talk, I mentioned that the Strandbeest would develop a digital brain. Let me tell you about the evolutionary development of Strandbeest after 2007.Comments (20)John CusackMakes films; Board member, Freedom of the Press FoundationThe Snowden Principle, and that fire that inspired him to take unimaginable risks, is fundamentally about fostering an informed and engaged public. The Constitution embraces that idea.Comments (1,019)Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOAs summer travel beckons for some of you, and with the hope of making your trip smoother, here are ten simple tips. And they come with a warning -- some of them drive my wife crazy when we all go on a family trip!Comments (14)Ann BrenoffSenior Writer, The Huffington PostIn fifth grade, my BFF Diane dumped me for some girl named Helen. Diane and I had been inseparable for years and it took me what felt like forever to get over feeling betrayed. I agonized over what I had \u0027done\u0027 to deserve such mistreatment, and spent months eating my lunch alone under \u0027our\u0027 tree on the playground.Comments (153)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027There are two great centers of unaccountable power in the American political-economic system today -- places where decisions that significantly affect large numbers of Americans are made in secret, and are unchecked either by effective democratic oversight or by market competition.Comments (645)Susie EssmanActress, Curb Your EnthusiasmMy husband doesn\u0027t hate Mad Men. He likes it a lot. Not as much as I do because my like borders on obsession and fixation. But he likes it. What my husband hates, is me, after I watch Mad Men.Comments (39)Amb. Marc GinsbergFmr. U.S. Ambassador to Morocco \u0026 White House Middle East AdviserFor all the ballyhooed determination to stand up for democratic change in the Middle East and pledges to never stand by when tens of thousands of innocent people are being massacred, Syria will regretably prove to be a major policy reversal on both counts.Comments (124)Arianna HuffingtonThis is a moment of great possibility and opportunity for all of us to play our part in course-correcting, and leveraging the best parts of the spirit of business and entrepreneurship to bring about fundamental changes to the ways we do business -- for the benefit of individuals, communities, and companies.Comments (447)Chen Guangcheng and Edward McMillan-ScottThe growing preoccupation with trade threatens to sideline the wider issue of how best to promote human rights and democratic reform in China, a country whose political future is set to determine the course of the 21st century.CommentsPatton OswaltComedian and writer who lives and drinks in Los AngelesThere is a collective consciousness that can detect the presence (and approach) of something good or bad, in society or the world, before any hard “evidence” exists. It’s happening now with the concept of “rape culture.” Which, by the way, isn’t a concept. It’s a reality.Comments (17)Illah NourbakhshDirector of the CREATE Lab and Head of the Robotics Master\u0027s Program at Carnegie Mellon University\u0027s Robotics InstituteWhether we enter a robot utopia, a robot smog or somewhere in between, we will close the gap between robotically aware and organically alive. Do we create new life forms, as Jansens suggests of his progeny?CommentsMark R. KennedyProfessor of political management and director of the Graduate School of Political Management, George Washington UniversityResolving the civil war in Syria has the potential to bring more stability to the region. The possibility of a win-win outcome should be a key selling point for Obama as he tries to gather more allies for the cause.CommentsJohn GlaserEditor at Antiwar.comAlas, the administration\u0027s stated reason for deciding to directly arm the Syrian rebels simply lacks credibility. So why the sudden shift in policy? The aim is apparently to keep the Syrian war going, for some key strategic reasons.CommentsAllison TateAuthor, mother of fourParenting is a great equalizer. Whether we are suburban moms hoping for a good nap out of our toddlers or renowned actresses or CTOs or television personalities or political big shots, we\u0027re parents. When our children scan a crowd expecting to see our faces, we want to be there. Period.CommentsSeamus McKiernanAssociate Blog Editor, The Huffington PostThis 9-year-old cancer survivor is on a mission to take back the term \"bucket list.\" One game of \"messy twister\" at a time. Maya, a third grader from Ohio who is battling a rare form of leukemia, wants to share her \"bucket list for summer 2013\" (below) to inspire others -- healthy or sick, old or young -- to get busy living.CommentsJim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027This is a very personal column. In December of last year, I was diagnosed with prostate cancer.Comments (29)François HollandePresident of FranceIt is a test for the G8, a group of advanced economies that must lead by example. The challenge is to work together to do everything in our power to build a safer, more prosperous, more sustainable, and fairer future.Comments (48)Juan del HierroPastorThis will be a very special Father\u0027s Day. It will be my first Father\u0027s Day since my husband and I adopted our baby boy Lucas. It will also be the first Father\u0027s Day in many years that I will get to celebrate in person with my own father, who\u0027s been living in Ecuador for many years.CommentsFoz MeadowsAuthor, blogger, bipedal mammal with delusions of immortality and carbon-based lifeform extraordinaire.If and when sentient AI becomes reality, will it, too, have the capacity to both anthropomorphize and dehumanize other beings in relation to itself? And if it did, would we view it as more or less human depending on which skill it used to refine its opinion of humanity?Comments (18)Kia MakarechiEntertainment Editor, The Huffington PostIt seems like what\u0027s happening here is that Miley Cyrus \"loves\" \"hood\" culture, thinks it\u0027s amusing and has no problem co-opting it for singles and/or viral videos, but doesn\u0027t love the idea of herself being seen as part of it. And that\u0027s gross.Comments (29)Martha BurkMoney Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsThe annual June Father\u0027s day shopping binge is at its zenith. Stores are touting the latest gizmos and geegaws, and everybody loves Dad. All except corporate America, that is. Just count the number of companies giving paid leave to men with newborns.Comments (57)Maggie FurlongWest Coast Editor, Huffington Post TV\"Food Network Star\" feels like sloppy seconds this season -- for good reason. It\u0027s the latest reality competition show to fall victim to several reality TV \"professionals.\"Comments (29)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistThere comes a moment in the life of every parent and child that defines their relationship. Sometimes it\u0027s planned, more often it\u0027s spontaneous, but in either case, it captures the soul of that most sacred familial connection. And sometimes -- if you\u0027re lucky -- it sets the tone for everything that follows.CommentsMichael BoltonSongwriter, recording artist and Chairman, The Michael Bolton Charities, Inc.This Father\u0027s Day can be remembered as the day when we fathers turned a collective corner, reducing domestic violence and sexual abuse to an aberration, not an everyday occurrence.Comments (35)Alexandra ParsleyStudentThat note changed my life. I messaged her back, explaining that I was her sister, and our father was very much alive and well. Trying to explain the joy and shock that crossed my father\u0027s face that evening is impossible.CommentsMichelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesHaving railed against gay marriage back when he was in Argentina, only to lose that battle, he may be seeing that the handwriting is on the wall and that he\u0027s got better things to do. And that can only be a loss for anti-equality advocates who hoped the pope would loudly lead their crusade.Comments (181)Lori DunlapWriter, researcherMy husband had to take over all household duties, including the many daily tasks required to take care of our two young sons. Life as I had known it had truly changed, and I was disoriented and miserable.CommentsKelly MacLeanStand up comic, actress, writerMy teacher introduces herself as Yoga Bandana, or at least thats what it sounds like to me. We begin class by setting an intention, she suggests \u0027Gratitude\u0027 but I\u0027ve done hot yoga before so my intention is \u0027To Not Die.\u0027Comments (23)Adam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; founder of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911You can be standing next to the wrong person on a bus and get the flu, and when your data is sitting on the wrong database and the wrong person gains access, you become a victim of identity theft.CommentsLeighton WoodhouseCo-founder, DogParkMedia.comOne of the most disturbing realities the surveillance revelations have brought into relief is that in its drive to safeguard national security, the Obama Administration has concocted tactics that draw a sharp line dividing the state and the public, casting the latter in the role of potential conspirator.Comments (412)William B.
