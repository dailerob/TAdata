Back in 1953, British philosopher Isaiah Berlin famously laid out two opposing styles of leadership -- hedgehogs and foxes -- taking his cue from a line in an ancient Greek poem by Archilochus: \"The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.\" According to Berlin, the fox will \"pursue many ends, often unrelated and even contradictory, connected, if at all, only in some de facto way.\" In contrast, the hedgehog offers an \"unchanging, all embracing... unitary inner vision.\" Right now, with the country in crisis mode, the American people sense that our problems can\u0027t be solved by foxy spinning, triangulating, slicing and dicing, and tinkering at the edges.
