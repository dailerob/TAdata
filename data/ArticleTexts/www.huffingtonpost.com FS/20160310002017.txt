{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressIt\u0027s safe to say that there\u0027s not a lot of love for Trump on Capitol Hill. But what if I told you that those lawmakers can do something, right now, to give an outlet to their Trump antipathy and make the world a better place to boot? Because I can think of one thing they can do: pass a federal law protecting people from strategic lawsuits against public participation, more colloquially known as SLAPP suits. What is a SLAPP suit? Basically, it\u0027s a lawsuit designed to chill free expression, in which a deep-pocketed litigant sues their critics knowing that the mere process of having to participate in the court battle could financially exhaust the defendant. Such lawsuits favor large corporations and wealthy plaintiffs, even when their cases are entirely frivolous. And Donald Trump? He loves him some SLAPP suits.To watch cable news, one would think that Bernie Sanders is still in the Democratic primary race simply to send a message to Washington, be a thorn in Hillary Clinton\u0027s side, play trainer to her Rocky, or some combination of all of these.Assistant Professor of English at University of New Hampshire; Series Co-Editor, Best American Experimental WritingIn an election cycle when the media can and does shape how we choose our next president, the fact we have fewer and fewer sources to look to for credible information regarding those who are running is frightening.

But Donald Trump has finally reached a point where parallels between his presidential campaign and the fascists of the first half of the 20th century are too evident to overlook.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027In caving in to blackmail from unscrupulous partners and in refusing to take consistent, moral stances, the EU is betraying its founding principles of democracy and individual liberty.Assistant professor at Marmara University; AuthorDonald Trump has demeaned and sexually harassed women openly for years.

No, this isn\u0027t a story about divorce. I\u0027m still happily married and building a company together with my husband. This is a story about equality.Equalist, entrepreneur, food lover and co-founder of DinOf course! No wonder Trump is gunning for the presidency! This is the greatest platform in the world for self-promotion!Writer and commentator in New York CityIt seems to me that God will not be satisfied with this ill-fated region of the world unless its \"courageous\" men believe that the living creature that shares the planet with them and that has two eyes, two arms and two legs, is totally equal to them -- and that the physical differences that God designed do not reduce her humanity or abilities.Blog Editor, The Huffington Post ArabiBernie Sanders won Michigan, and will win the presidency, because he\u0027s the only honest candidate in 2016.

But former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton narrowly lost to Senator Bernie Sanders in Michigan because she underperformed with working-class, white male voters, a group Trump does well with. This portends a serious problem for Clinton should she face Trump in the November presidential election.Hofstra Journalism ProfessorFew have actually taken the time to closely scrutinize Ted Cruz\u0027s actual record. Now that the race for the GOP presidential contest is effectively a two-man race between Trump and Cruz, it\u0027s time to take the hard look at Cruz that should have been done long ago.Author and political analystWhile the rally cries of \u0027don\u0027t tax my vagina\u0027 are confronting and provocative, there is far less understanding concerning the gendered implications of how governments tax income, savings and wealth, and redistributes this using the transfer system.Lauren Murphy is not the voice of her generation, just a part of a generation trying to find their voice.Bernie Sanders\u0027 victory in the Michigan primary is incredibly important for a number of reasons.
