{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week brought two very different goodbyes. First, we said adios to 54 years of Cuban isolation policy, with President Obama lifting bans on travel and trade and resuming diplomatic relations. The other goodbye was to The Colbert Report. After nine years and 1,447 episodes, Stephen Colbert signed off in appropriate fashion, with Santa, a unicorn, Abe Lincoln, and a chess match with Death. Then, he was joined by dozens of former guests -- including Big Bird, Henry Kissinger, George Lucas, Katie Couric, James Franco, Cory Booker, Willie Nelson, and myself -- for a bittersweet version of \"We\u0027ll Meet Again.\" After nearly a decade of Colbert, it\u0027s clear that what\u0027s truly special about him isn\u0027t his amazing wit, incredible timing, or even how staggeringly funny he is; it\u0027s his heart. Underneath his blowhard character, his humor consistently came from a place of compassion and truth (in the guise of truthiness) -- exactly what we need in these polarized times. Thankfully, we\u0027ll all be resuming ties with Colbert again soon.What we need in the United States is not division; what we need is not hatred; what we need is not violence and lawlessness, but is love, and wisdom, and compassion toward one another, and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityA few hours ago I read about remarks made by a prominent individual on a much-celebrated TV show Sunday morning and I have been haunted by them ever since. The remarks concerned the torture report recently released to the American people by a committee of the United States Senate.Founder, People for the American WayThe current Ebola outbreak underscores that pathogens remain clear and present dangers to humanity, economic development, and national security in an interconnected 21st century world, and we must remain vigilant against them.Public Health Editor, The Huffington Post; Former U.S. Assistant Surgeon GeneralToday, as The Colbert Report airs its final episode, I\u0027m looking back with gratitude on nine years of great television. I loved being on the show several times, discussing everything from my Greek accent to self-sabotage to the obnoxious roommate living in my head. Here are some of my favorite moments on The Colbert Report over the years.Instead of pitting the deaths of Liu and Ramos against Garner and Brown; we can join them together, understanding them as martyrs whose live inspire us on both sides of the blue line to work for a more just, safe and united America.Executive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostBe shocked, be disgusted, be appalled, but don\u0027t be fooled. Mainstream coverage of U.S. torture in general, and of this new report in particular, rests on three false assumptions.Author, \u0027Mainstreaming Torture\u0027While filming a new movie in London, I learned that the sole shale gas well in the nation -- just a few hours north of me -- has triggered two earthquakes, suffered a \"structural integrity failure,\" and risked poisoning water supplies.Oscar-nominated actor, climate change activistAs a historian of Cuba, as a Cuban-American, as an American citizen, I applaud President Obama\u0027s change of course on Cuba. Surprisingly, so do my 93 and 88-year old Republican parents in Miami.Professor of History and Latin American and Caribbean Studies at New York UniversityBy selling himself as someone who could get things done with Republicans, Obama gave them the power to make him a success or failure. Unsurprisingly, they chose the latter option. Is Hillary Clinton about to make the same mistake -- and will voters buy it if she does?Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourAfter the Sydney crisis, Australia and the world are mourning the loss of two lives: a mother of three and a beloved son. Iranians here in the diaspora mourn too, for the lives taken, and for the as-yet-unknown loss of momentum toward a harmonious peace and place in the world untainted by the actions of a few.Host and producer, HuffPost LiveIt\u0027s time to revisit the very real problem of how law enforcement agencies at all levels of government employ the power of asset forfeiture as a means of harming, and in many instances destroying, the livelihood of individuals and small businesses.Principal, Liberty Strategies; 2008 presidential candidateWe have all lost in this fight. There are no winners, and with the announcement, pained feelings we have carried for five decades come to the surface.Senior Editor, HuffPost VocesFor those who are serious about wanting to reduce the number of abortions in the United States, easy access to affordable and effective contraception, and ready advice about the proper use of contraception, is critical.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoWhile technically we\u0027re still dealing with the hypothetical, the speculation-obsessed media doesn\u0027t seem all that bothered by the prospect either. That\u0027s what happens when we treat politicians like celebrities and exchange paychecks for access.Host/Producer, HuffPost LiveI was just a normal kid. I had 1,000 followers and I was the farthest thing from a role model and the person I consider myself to be today. From the bottom of my heart, I am truly sorry to each and every person I have ever offended.Vine starWhen there is conflict in unstable nations, the tide comes in with the strength of a tsunami to drown out the precious advances that women have made in those countries.Writer of English fiction and a journalistBy embracing the absurd and truly embodying it, Colbert has made politics and public policy uproariously funny, while providing much-needed bouts of sanity for devoted news junkies.Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaToday, President Barack Obama took bold action to put an end to this farce. Over half a century of a counterproductive sanctions and isolation policy is coming to an end. But Cuba is only one of many examples of domestic politics rendering American foreign policy dysfunctional.President, National Iranian American CouncilPolicy Fellow, National Iranian American CouncilWhen politicians start advancing laws that will actually help women -- not just co-opting the language -- then we can all celebrate and declare a real victory.Director of the ACLU’s Reproductive Freedom Project.One man charged the terrorist. Tori Johnson was 34. He managed the Lindt Chocolate Café for two years. Employees and customers all said he was a good man, a kind man. He was also a gay man.President, Moorfield Storey InstituteRape culture is living in a society in which your story is dissected rather than heard; it\u0027s being told your inherent, God-given value begins to disintegrate once your story gets uncomfortable and its trajectory skewed.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersNot only do we rank 26th in median wealth, we also are the most anti-employee country in the developed world. Actually, the two go together because rising inequality results from our pro-Wall Street and anti-worker policies.Author, \"How to Make a Million Dollars an Hour\" (Wiley 2013)Below are some of the top stories that made 2014 a watershed year in the fight to end America\u0027s longest failed war.Director of Media Relations, Drug Policy AllianceSometimes, when I tell people that I am a feminist, they are a little confused about what, exactly, I mean.Blogger, I Am Begging My Mother Not To Read This BlogThe campaign finance deregulation policy rider to the spending legislation signed by the president is a final recognition by politicians of both parties that nothing will be done to prevent or even slow down the seemingly unstoppable march toward even more money in American politics.Senior Fellow at the Bipartisan Policy CenterSure, by the numbers, assuming people are straight is a safe bet. Most people are. But assumptions are dangerous. This particular assumption implies to my son that there is something wrong him for being other than straight. And there\u0027s not. He should be exactly who he is.Mother, wife, breadwinnerAs I prepare to retire from NRDC and hand the reins over to our incoming president Rhea Suh, I have been reflecting on how the climate movement can secure the solutions we need to protect future generations from harm. In my view, here are issues we need to keep in mind.President, NRDCOn the night that Yusuf Islam, the artist formerly known as Cat Stevens, kicked off his first American tour in 38 years, there were many of us at the show who were excited to hear the music but wondering aloud about the performer\u0027s politics.SiriusXM Radio HostThis week, my husband and I will celebrate our 36th anniversary. Some years we\u0027ve gotten dressed-up and gone out to dinner. Other years we\u0027ve simply marked the day with a kiss. That\u0027s what marriage is: richer, poorer, good times and bad. Each year with its surprises and challenges, its hard fought lessons, its moments of sweetness.Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist and author of the relationship advice blog Speaking of MarriageTo say that Black lives matter is not to say that other lives do not; indeed, it is quite the reverse -- it is to recognize that all lives do matter, and to acknowledge that African Americans are often targeted unfairly and that our society is not yet so advanced as to have become truly color blind.Minister, BuxMont Unitarian Universalist FellowshipGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"BLAME GAME: DEMS DID IT!",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
