{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"It\u0027s hard to say which required a greater suspension of disbelief this week: Santa wriggling down the chimney or the President\u0027s justifications for the NSA spying scandal. And how about VP Grinch rushing back home to play Senate tie-breaker and pick the pockets of those needing Medicaid, Medicare, Food Stamps, and student loans? I hope he got a lump of coal in his stocking. For the rest of you, here\u0027s one last present to open: some of the best blog posts of the past week.READ POST | comments (11)12.23.2005 Nora EphronI love making desserts for Christmas dinner, and I have always believed that I make excellent desserts. But now that everything has gone to hell, I realize that the only dessert anyone ate with real enthusiasm was Jane’s bread pudding...READ POST | comments (47)12.24.2005 Christopher GuestThe stress of gift giving, forced family visits, and too much bad food shouldn’t keep one from enjoying a good book. These are some of my favorites. Most have become classics. Some may be new to you.READ POST | comments (22)12.24.2005 David MametREAD POST | comments (22)12.23.2005 Paul RieckhoffTwo years ago, I spent Christmas in Baghdad with the men of my infantry platoon. That Christmas was both the worst and the best one I have ever had.READ POST | comments (15)12.22.2005 Bruce Kluger \u0026 David SlavinGiven that it\u0027s hard to giftwrap a knuckle sandwich or a swift kick in the pants, we figured these presents might be just what the doctor—or Jack Abramoff—ordered.READ POST | comments (15)12.21.2005 Adam McKayDoes Dick Cheney know he\u0027s evil? I mean it. Does he occasionally look up from his breakfast of one hard boiled egg and a plate of heart pills and say to himself, \"Man, I\u0027m an evil fuck”?READ POST | comments (103)12.21.2005 Arianna HuffingtonBill Frist, video diagnostician. Bill Frist, stock market genius. Bill Frist. Intelligent Design vs. Evolution. That Dick \"5 deferments\" Cheney was willing to go toe-to-toe with John \"5 years as a POW\" McCain over the issue of torture…READ POST | comments (78)12.20.2005 Marty KaplanNo betrayal of public trust by Bush, Cheney, Frist, DeLay et al can be so outrageous that Republicans are at a loss for confecting some tortuous defense of it.READ POST | comments (62)12.23.2005 David ReesThe Minutemen\u0027s catalytic philosophy--that \"punk is whatever we make it to be\" -- is the greatest band philosophy of all time.READ POST | comments (29)12.20.2005 Rep. John ConyersMy new report concludes that a number of the administration\u0027s actions amount to prima facie evidence that federal criminal laws have been violated. Legal violations span from false statements to Congress to whistleblower laws.READ POST | comments (119)12.19.2005 Kristen BreitweiserPresident Bush should be stopped in his tracks with regard to his use of 9/11 scare tactics to circumvent constitutional laws that are meant to protect U.S. citizens.READ POST | comments (66)12.24.2005 Wes TyrellREAD POST | comments (22)12.24.2005 Danielle CrittendenWhat on earth do you get for a man who resents your relationship with his baby girl, thinks you’re unworthy, and believes your political views and the way you earn your living are both stupid?READ POST | comments (17)12.21.2005 Robert ScheerThe joy that President Bush has expressed over the country\u0027s latest election, though more restrained than his infamous \"Mission Accomplished\" speech, will similarly come back to haunt him.READ POST | comments (62)12.20.2005 Harry ShearerAt the time we invaded Iraq, one country really did (a) have weapons of mass destruction, (b) a history of armed conflict with its neighbor, and (c) a known record of supporting Al Qaeda and the Taliban -- and that country was Pakistan.READ POST | comments (21)12.19.2005 Martin Garbus and Leonard WeinglassNixon lost on the exact same issue that Bush presents. How, then, does Bush, Alberto Gonzales, the Attorney General (and his predecessor John Ashcroft) argue they have the right to do it?READ POST | comments12.20.2005 Geoffrey R. StoneBush apparently believes that the evil-doers assume we act within the bounds of our own Constitution. So, we’ll trick them. We won’t.READ POST | comments (51)12.19.2005 Aaron FreemanCould somebody please stop the spread of democracy in the Middle East? I do not like the way it\u0027s turning out. Iran for example has been having elections for almost thirty years, and look who wins them.READ POST | comments (20)12.19.2005 Timothy NaftaliOne key difference from now is that in the Cold War no one tried to argue that warrantless monitoring of Americans is legal. Participants in HTLingual understood that the program violated the Fourth Amendment.READ POST | comments (42)12.23.2005 Bob BurnettConvert to Christianity, George Bush. Abandon the fundamentalist pabulum you’ve been spouting. Pay attention to the teachings of Jesus: The admonition to tell the truth. Not to murder.
