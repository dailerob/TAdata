Churches and mosques are backlit by a gauzy sea. The carcass of a bombed building sits beside a beach club with bathers and music playing. The Lebanese have an exuberant spirit, endless courses of food at the restaurants, and at night, fireworks and gunshots in the air.Actor and ProducerI know I\u0027m being grumpy, but there are just certain things that grind my nerves down to the root.
