{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Hello, our names are Ellen and Arianna, and we are PDA-aholics. No, we\u0027re not addicted to public displays of affection (as nice as they may be). We\u0027re addicted to our personal digital assistants -- our iPhones and BlackBerrys, and all the other digital devices we can\u0027t live without (iPods and laptops and Kindles, etc.). And since we know this has become a widespread malady -- 84 percent of people check their PDAs just before bed and as soon as they wake up -- HuffPost Living and Health magazine have decided to join forces to help you de-stress, relax, and get your life back under control. All this month, we\u0027ll be offering ways to help you unplug and recharge. Take the Unplug and Recharge Challenge (it will only take you 30 minutes a day) and learn how to break your addiction to always being connected.Read Post | CommentsBrian Levin, J.D., 05.04.2010Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityAs politicians and commentators square off over terrorism defendants like Faisal Shahzad, the alleged Times Square bomb plotter, being read their Miranda rights, an important point is often missed.Read Post | CommentsRobert Reich, 05.04.2010Former Secretary of Labor, Professor at BerkeleyOur future well-being depends more on people like Steve Jobs who invent real products that can improve our lives, than it does on people like Jamie Dimon who invent financial products that do little other than threaten our economy.Read Post | CommentsSen.
