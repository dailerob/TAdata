{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Georgetown UniversityRush Limbaugh\u0027s remarks about Sandra Fluke, following her respectful and sincere testimony, can only be described as misogynistic, vitriolic, and a misrepresentation of the position of our student. In our vibrant and diverse society, there always are important differences that need to be debated, with strong and legitimate beliefs held on all sides of challenging issues. The greatest contribution of the American project is the recognition that together, we can rely on civil discourse to engage the tensions that characterize these difficult issues, and work towards resolutions that balance deeply held and different perspectives. We must return to the values that hold us together.Read Post | Comments (619)James Zogby, 03/03/12President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027And so it is that the tables appear to have been turned in the Washington that will greet the Israeli leader. He will not be pressured to do what he has long been loathe to do -- address Palestinian rights.Read Post | Comments (211)Mark Hyman, MD, 03/03/12Practicing physicianNo doubt, a severe food allergy is scary. But it\u0027s also relatively rare. A much more common scenario is an adult with a low-grade food allergy to say, gluten, who never pinpoints the cause of his misery.Read Post | Comments (75)Steve Clemons, 03/02/12Publisher, \u0027The Washington Note\u0027Israel, under Netanyahu\u0027s leadership, seems to want to drive a dynamic in which it demonstrates its power by compelling the president to attack Iran on its behalf. This is neither in Israel\u0027s real interests -- nor America\u0027s.Read Post | Comments (307)Peter Hotez, M.D, Ph.D., 03/03/12President, Sabin Vaccine Institute; Founding dean of National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine; Author, \u0027Forgotten People, Forgotten Diseases\u0027It\u0027s not easy to introduce neglected tropical diseases, or NTDs, to first time audiences. The truth is they may be the most important diseases of girls and women you have never heard of.Read Post | CommentsJanet Tavakoli, 03/03/12President, Tavakoli Structured FinanceThe disputes over credit default swaps on Greece highlight the fact that most participants in the credit derivatives market are at the mercy of ISDA when it comes to interpretation of ISDA\u0027s language. The only solution to that is to exercise one\u0027s rights.Read Post | Comments (21)Melani Robinson, 03/02/12Writer, mother, dog-lover, widow, yoga-doer, recent New YorkerThe tone of his texts changed. He said it wasn\u0027t the same without me -- we had several exchanges -- we were flirting. At least I thought we were, but could a 28-year-old man be attracted to a 50-year-old woman?Read Post | Comments (86)Scott Mendelson, 03/02/12Film Critic at Mendelson\u0027s Memos, Valley Scene MagazineAndrew Stanton\u0027s John Carter is neither the next step in grand-scale franchise filmmaking nor an unmitigated disaster. I appreciated the sheer weirdness of the prologue, while in turn wanting the film to \u0027just get on with it.\u0027Read Post | Comments (42)Will Durst, 03/02/12Political comic, former radio talk show host, syndicated columnist, author, motivational speakerWhile cruising to an easy victory in the Arizona primary Mitt Romney barely eked out a squeaker in Michigan. That\u0027s the problem with running around 12 different home states, eventually you\u0027re bound to trip and stumble up some familiar front steps.Read Post | CommentsMary L. Gray, Ph.D., 03/02/12Senior Researcher, Microsoft Research New England; Associate Professor of Communication and Culture, Indiana UniversityRallying to punish Dharun Ravi does not do justice to Tyler Clementi\u0027s life, nor does it move us one step closer to preventing another young person from turning to suicide. The politics of blame are a dead end. Instead, we need to build out an ethos of shared responsibility.Read Post | Comments (33)Simon Johnson, 03/02/12MIT professor; Co-author, \u002713 Bankers\u0027; Columnist on fiscal affairsIf you cut taxes, revenues will fall and deficits will increase. If you change the CBO\u0027s scoring process to hide this fact -- as is under consideration by leading Republicans -- you are engaging in exactly the same sort of deception that brought down Greece.Read Post | Comments (253)Jeanne Devon (AKMuckraker), 03/03/12Managing editor, themudflats.netIt\u0027s now evident (with her latest vote on the Blunt amendment making it crystal clear) that Murkowski is, in fact, willing to cast her own moderate beliefs and opinions aside to appease the party leadership.Read Post | Comments (54)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 03/02/12Author, \u0027Our Fathers Ourselves. Daughters, Fathers, And The Changing American Family\u0027There\u0027s an increasingly sensitive tripwire between faith and policy these days. To question the latter is to incite charges you\u0027re denigrating the former. It\u0027s especially difficult when you\u0027re talking about the Catholic Church.Read Post | Comments (742)Matthew Dowd, 03/02/12Political strategistThe economy is still by far the dominant issue with voters concerned about jobs, finances, and the federal deficit\u0027s impact on economic growth. So why, in the Republican presidential primary, are candidates talking more and more about social and cultural issues like contraception?Read Post | Comments (165)Emmanuelle Chriqui, 03/02/12Actress and activistIt is time to bridge the gap between the suffering in Congo, and American consumers. We have the power to pressure companies to clean up their supply chains and not source from mines controlled by armed groups. We can demand that our products be conflict-free.Read Post | CommentsDr. Karen Becker, 03/03/12Proactive and integrative wellness veterinarianI\u0027m not convinced surveys that attempt to measure people, for whatever reason, by the type of pet they own or don\u0027t own are useful or even accurate. But they\u0027re certainly entertaining.Read Post | CommentsDavid Wild, 03/02/12TV Writer; Contributing Editor, Rolling Stone; Co-Author, \u0027Diary of a Player\"\u0027I say boycott Rush and The Rush Limbaugh Show -- at least until he apologizes openly to Sandra Fluke.Read Post | Comments (215)Morra Aarons-Mele, 03/02/12CEO, Women OnlineHow much further right from the center are we pushing political dialogue in this country when we\u0027re debating whether or insurance companies should cover birth control? How many more women\u0027s voices will we remove from the debate?Read Post | Comments (267)Michael B. Keegan, 03/02/12President, People For the American WayThe story is about more than one judge doing something wildly inappropriate. It\u0027s about a conservative movement in which the bile and animosity directed at the president are so poisonous that even someone who should know better confuses political criticism and sick personal attack.Read Post | Comments (296)Jayanti Tamm, 03/02/12Author, \u0027Cartwheels in a Sari: A Memoir of Growing Up Cult\u0027An uncomfortable silence filled the classroom. No one had started writing a response to the question I had written. Finally, one student raised her hand.\"What does \u0027chauvinist\u0027 mean?\"Read Post | Comments (102)Dennis Santiago, 03/02/12CEO of Institutional Risk AnalyticsThe FDIC closed another bank in Georgia this week bringing the total to three so far in 2012. Global Commerce Bank in Doraville became the latest casualty of the bank clean up\u0027s march through the South.Read Post | CommentsJames Kwak, 03/02/12Associate professor, University of Connecticut School of Law, and co-author, White House BurningIf the tax cuts were bad a decade ago, what has changed since then (for now, leaving aside cyclical issues)? We have had one more decade of aging and health care inflation (and war), so the long-term budget outlook looks considerably worse.Read Post | Comments (52)Larry Doyle, 03/02/12Author, \u0027I Love You, Beth Cooper,\u0027 \u0027Go Mutants!\u0027 and \u0027Deliriously Happy\u0027Once upon a time, the lessons propagated by Dr. Seuss, then called conservation, anti-totalitarianism, equality, spirituality and trying new foods, were universal virtues we all wanted to teach our children. But now the right has exposed them as socialist scams.Read Post | Comments (211)Dr. Josef Olmert, 03/02/12Adjunct Professor, University of South CarolinaThe build-up to the Obama-Netanyahu summit on Monday, March 5 is in full force. Words like \"crucial\", \"fatal\", \"last-ditch effort\" are in ample supply. Still, I venture to predict that a lot of the drama, whether real or manufactured, is overblown and premature.Read Post | Comments (33)Chris Anderson, 03/02/12Curator of TEDRead Post | Comments (412)Heather Higgins, 03/02/12President of the Independent Women\u0027s Voice, serves on various non-profit boards, businesswoman and media commentatorSoup kitchens over art and music programs? Social justice over inner city education? Homeless shelters over medical research? ACORN over the environment?
