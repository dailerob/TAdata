{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Christian leader for social changeThe hot phrase in Washington, D.C., this week is \"class warfare.\" Many have attacked President Barack Obama as a class warrior because he has suggested that the wealthiest individuals in the country, along with the largest corporations, should pay what he calls their \"fair share\" of the costs of both deficit reduction and putting Americans back to work. The only people doing well in this economy are the people at the very top, some of whose selfish behavior caused this recession in the first place. Only they have \"recovered\" from the crisis they helped create. The rest of us are still trying to recover. So there really is a class war going on -- and the upper class is winning.Read Post | CommentsRobert Reich, 9/22/11Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Aftershock\u0027The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped another 3 percent today as Wall Street metabolized the truth most Americans already know: We\u0027re in a recession. The \"double dip\" has arrived.Read Post | CommentsVicki Escarra, 09.21.2011President and CEO of Feeding AmericaEvery person and every sector has an obligation to help our fellow citizens and ensure America\u0027s prosperity. Hunger is an urgent issue in America, and we must do something about it now. Not tomorrow or next year, but now. People are suffering today.Read Post | Comments (25)Shirin Sadeghi, 9/22/11Host, New America Now; former producer, the BBC and Al JazeeraIt is a sad state of world affairs when there is only one person who takes the UN and its handful of leaders to task when given the opportunity. It is even sadder that that one man\u0027s words will change nothing for the devastated majority of this world who suffer from those leaders\u0027 sins.Read Post | CommentsRev. Al Sharpton, 9/22/11President, National Action NetworkAs I left Georgia yesterday for NY, I was consumed with irony. So many heads of state were gathered at the UN hearing the U.S. stress the importance of human rights as we simultaneously executed this man.Read Post | CommentsJason Linkins, 9/22/11Editor, Eat the PressTonight, Fox is partnering with Google on its GOP debate coverage, and there\u0027s a good chance that it is going to drown the proceedings in all sorts of superfluous gloss and technical gimmickry.Read Post | Comments (14)Rep. Carolyn Maloney, 9/22/11U.S. Representative for New York\u0027s 14th DistrictThis President not only supports women and the issues that impact them on a daily basis, but puts policies in place to help women and their families thrive. Questioning his commitment is sadly misplaced.Read Post | CommentsBob Cesca, 9/21/11Producer, Editor of BobCesca.comRick Perry\u0027s new video is a fantastic example of the Republican capacity to obfuscate the truth and win supporters in spite of flagrantly lying to them. They\u0027re able to get away with whopper lies so massive, they\u0027re almost hilariously off the rails.Read Post | Comments (819)Dan Rather, 9/22/11Host, \u0027Dan Rather Reports\u0027Why should we care about the plight of honeybees? Because the entire food chain is at risk. One in three bites of food we eat is directly dependent on insect pollination.Read Post | Comments (15)Mitchell Bard, 9/21/11Writer and FilmmakerI understand that President Obama is very interested in appearing above the fray, avoiding partisan battles. But the current GOP is interested in nothing but partisan battles.Read Post | Comments (144)Allan Gerson, 9/22/11Lawyer and former Counsel to the US Delegation to the United NationsThe Palestinians would be wise to take note a past Franco-Egyptian maneuver for establishing a new framework for settling their conflict with Israel. By not forcing the vote they can create a win-win situation for all concerned.Read Post | CommentsArianna Huffington, 9/21/11I am delighted to announce HuffPost\u0027s 2011 Game Changers -- our third annual celebration of 100 innovators, mavericks, visionaries, and leaders who are changing the way we look at the world and the way we live in it.Read Post | Comments (183)Alisha L. Gordon, M.Ed., 9/21/11Founder of \"Finding the Pieces\", Speaker, and TeacherAs a native of Georgia, Decatur to be specific, I mourn for us. We\u0027ve taken some steps back in our progression; there\u0027s a silent, suffocating fear that is hovering over our state.Read Post | Comments (86)Menachem Rosensaft, 9/22/11Founding Chairman of the International Network of Children of Jewish Holocaust SurvivorsIt would be foolish in the extreme for any of us to lose sight of the fact that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\u0027s continued saber-rattling constitutes a far greater time-bomb than anything that PA President Mahmoud Abbas or any other Palestinian leader says or does.Read Post | Comments (64)Rashad Robinson, 9/22/11Executive Director, ColorOfChangeBefore he died, Troy told us that this was about more than him -- and he called on those of us who have fought against his execution to continue fighting for justice, even if we weren\u0027t successful in saving his life.Read Post | Comments (155)Stanley Weiss, 9/22/11Founding Chairman, Business Executives for National SecurityMaybe if the benefits of peace in the Middle East were made material and not ethereal, with concrete commitments rather than vague promises, it would be the kind of disruptive development that sparks compromise.Read Post | CommentsLila Kalick, 9/22/11Assistant Blog Editor, The Huffington PostMost of the stuff floating around in the ether about who millennials are and what we will become is the byproduct of older generations\u0027 curiosity, concern and fear for our future. We\u0027ve been letting them write the history of our future and there isn\u0027t anything funny about it.Read Post | CommentsArt Brodsky, 9/22/11Communications Director, Public KnowledgeIt took AT\u0026T stepping way over the line to get the Justice Dept. engaged, but who is to say that line won\u0027t be crossed again? And that some public officials who take the public interest and antitrust seriously won\u0027t act again?Read Post | CommentsWray Herbert, 9/22/11Author, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027Psychological scientist Christopher Moyer, and a group of colleagues at the University of Wisconsin -- Stout, designed a brain study to see if there might be at least some benefit after a very brief period of meditation training.Read Post | CommentsSteve Clemons, 9/22/11Publisher, \u0027The Washington Note\u0027President Obama\u0027s speech at the United Nations yesterday paled in comparison to the soaring, expectation raising addresses he gave early in his administration, particularly in Cairo, but also at past UN General Assembly gatherings. The President has lost his groove.Read Post | Comments (124)Holly B.

Learsy, 9/22/11Author, \u0027Oil and Finance: The Epic Corruption\u0027Times are a changing. With \"peak oil\" finally in proper perspective the hegemony of OPEC over the oil market is starting to sunder. The ascendancy of oil production in many corners of the world is beginning to change the accepted rules of the market.Read Post | Comments (46)Mary Mapes, 9/21/11Veteran TV reporter, on the team that broke the Abu Ghraib scandalOur system, too often, is as fundamentally unfair as we are -- as cruel as any one person can be, as riddled with hypocrisy, confusion and mistakes. Tonight, as prayers are delivered and hopes are dashed, we should resolve to finally do something about our addiction to execution.Read Post | Comments (164)Kevin Smith, 9/22/11That fat guy who got thrown off the plane.My most cherished responsibility as a bona fide indie filmmaker is to let everyone know the shot is always worth taking. It costs nothing to encourage an artist, and the potential return is immeasurable. A song will cheer your mood. A movie will let you escape. A podcast will make you laugh.
