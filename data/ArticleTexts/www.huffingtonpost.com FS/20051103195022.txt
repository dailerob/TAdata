{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"From cbsnews.comAPCan somebody please, please, please shut Carville up -- especially about Plamegate. His takes on the scandal are utterly compromised by his marriage to Mary Matalin. This isn\u0027t like the weird-but-fun old days when they were running opposing campaigns during the day and sharing pillow talk at night. Now, as one of Dick Cheney\u0027s most trusted advisors, one of eight members of the White House Iraq Group, a witness in front of the Plamegate grand jury, and a close friend of Scooter Libby, Matalin is a central player in all this.
