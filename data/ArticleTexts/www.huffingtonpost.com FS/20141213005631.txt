{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor, historian, authorAbsent any criminal prosecutions, the only conclusion we will be left with is that these guys really are \"patriots\" and torturing people really is \"who we are.\" The morality and ethics of whether or not the CIA can torture people in our name are non-negotiable. There is no argument that can be made to justify this atrocity. The corporate media are treating torture as if it\u0027s just another \"issue\" like immigration reform or the federal budget. It isn\u0027t. You cannot justify the unjustifiable. People who attempt to apologize for torture done in their name are embarrassing themselves; raising their heads to be counted as barbarians at the gate. We don\u0027t fight against terrorists to become more like them, but to maintain our differences.Consider these the early slush of the coming Republican winter, the first returns on investment for their donors. Tucked into the 1,603-page bill to fund the government -- that no legislator will read -- are cankerous riders, foreshadowing what is to come.President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureFor the next two years we will see Republicans do everything they can to deliver for corporate America at the expense of the American people. The only question is whether Democrats will enable them. Will President Obama continue to make compromise after compromise?Senior Fellow, Roosevelt Institute; author of \u0027Fighting for Our Health\u0027The life of a cancer patient can be summed up in one word: access. Everybody wants access to you. Whether it\u0027s the lab tech taking your blood or the chemo staff giving you an infusion, there are lots of \"ins and outs\" when you have cancer. You\u0027ll get used to it.Reimagine.me columnist and Professional Cancer SurvivorLet\u0027s cut the talk of fundamental American values that the rest of the world should admire. Obama may not want to dwell on the past, but history will, and his legacy on torture will be one of acceptance.Host/Producer, HuffPost LiveTrue, the CRomnibus, the nickname of the bill to fund the federal government through next September, runs to over 1,600 pages. But I suspect most readers will associate the \"m\" word with massive amounts of government spending, and that\u0027s just plain wrong.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorWe\u0027re nearing New Year\u0027s resolutions. Go ahead and resolve to lose weight but then ask yourself what that has to do with living a good life for you. Does it mean better health, looking better, feeling better about yourself? Dig deeper into your resolutions and you\u0027ll find your list of what makes for a good life now.Director of New York Public Programs for the Aspen InstituteDesigning environments for seniors to age in place is an important part of the benefits communities can provide for individuals in the 21st century. And everyone -- across all generations -- will benefit from this emphasis on promoting better health across the life cycle.Public Health Editor, The Huffington Post; Former U.S. Assistant Surgeon GeneralThe past few days have provided vivid evidence that the U.S. government has become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wall Street and other wealthy special interests and no longer a government of, by, and for the people.Entertainment attorney, writer and political activistEarlier this week I learned that a story that had run on HuffPost Parents had left one of our readers a bit upset. The post was entitled \"20 Kids\u0027 Names That Most Often Appear On The \u0027Naughty\u0027 List,\" and the reader was a 7-year-old girl named Ella -- which also happened to be the number-one name on the \"naughty\" list.The United States cannot lead the world if it condones the use of torture. It is unclear why the patriots who led the U.S. government and the CIA through the trauma of 9/11 and its immediate aftermath fail to recognize this.Associate Professor of the Practice, Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University, Director, Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland SecurityWe acted identically, however, our narratives sharply diverged. Ironically so, as this treatment only underscored the unfortunate truth we had taken to the streets to protest: black and white bodies are not treated equally.First-year Master of Divinity student at Union Theological SeminaryThird-year Master of Divinity student at Union Theological Seminary2014 was full of Hollywood stars behaving oddly (See Shia LaBeouf and Amanda Bynes) and loads of fake viral videos. But this year saw fabrication with dead-serious ripple effects as well. Here are the prevaricators who rose to the top of the LieSpotting list this year:Founder and CEO, CalibrateMany white Americans tend to see this problem as unfortunate incidents based on individual circumstances. Black Americans see a system in which their black lives matter less than white lives. The question is: Are we white people going to listen or not?Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersOn December 10th President Obama hosted a White House Summit on Early Education, bringing together a broad coalition of philanthropic, business, education, child advocacy and elected leaders and other key stakeholders.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundOf course, we sincerely hope that you never need to use our list of helpful tips. But if you do find yourself needing to report a sexual assault some day, perhaps the list will come in handy -- at least as handy as all of the terrible how-to-not-get-raped advice that we\u0027ve all been given lately.Writer \u0026 AttorneyCo-Founder, End Rape On CampusThe kind of corruption that the omnibus bill embodies is exhibit A for why our nation is failing. It is why 91 percent of Americans don\u0027t approve of Congress. It is the auctioning of our government to big money special interests on grotesque display for all the world to see.Director, Represent.UsWe now must shift our focus from reaction and responding to planning and preparing. Only then will our health investments lead to real gains in the health of all people regardless of their income or nationality.President of the Rockefeller FoundationPresident, World Bank GroupHowever, while it\u0027s easy to lament to the failings of our sports fandoms in 2014, there\u0027s no denying that there was also a lot of good to come from the past year.Editorial Fellow, Huffington PostWe\u0027ve all had those days. The kids are fighting. They don\u0027t appreciate the treat you gave them. They\u0027re rude. They forget their manners. Does it make them monsters or you a bad parent? Despite what many would say while wagging a finger, No. It does not.Mother, freelance writer, and music therapistOkCupid. Match\u0027s cheap little cousin. Free, actually, which means there are about zero barriers to entry. This should be interesting. I get my profile set up pretty quickly, stealing/or reworking both answers and pictures from other sites.WriterWhen Kobe Bryant talks, we listen. That\u0027s what five NBA titles and a league MVP gets you. As a result, it became national news when the 36-year-old Bryant was caught on camera going after his teammates for a lackluster effort during practice. \"Soft,\" he called them.The Huffington Post\u0027s sports columnist, The Schultz ReportThey are the hurtful whispers in my head when I\u0027m standing in front of the mirror naked. The thoughts and insecurities when I\u0027m in bed with my husband. These are some of my most painful and embarrassing memories.Writer/Blogger, piganddac.comThe threat of climate change is screaming at us. We must approach this global threat with the urgency that it warrants. We must work together, rich nations and developing nations as well, to avoid the instability and vulnerability that will surely befall us if we fail to heed the warning on climate change.U.S. Secretary of StateIt seems like there were more companies that had privacy-related problems in 2014 than didn\u0027t. And the lucky ones that didn\u0027t \"get got\" were separated by only one or two degrees from those that did. As we look ahead to 2015, I see a mix of old privacy concerns along with a few emerging dangers.Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911Today, our son is 21 and he will tell you the worst part of his illness is the stigma. Why do we as a society stigmatize our friends, family, and others by branding them with a mark of disgrace?Mental Health Professional, Advocate, Mother and TravelerWe preserve our cultural identity and we take care of the environment to ensure that future generations can peacefully and safely coexist with nature in the same way. But oil exploitation would inevitably mean an end to our life and culture as we know it.Indigenous rights and rainforest protection nonprofitNo matter what lens one uses, it is impossible to deny the racial and class implications of all three incidents.President, Morehouse CollegeThere must be a national Democratic strategy comparable to that developed by Karl Rove for the GOP. This is more than a compelling populist message.Berkeley writer, retired Silicon Valley executiveIt\u0027s not surprising that a New York boyfriend\u0027s standards can be so damn high, but it can be difficult to come up with creative date ideas all of the time.Managing Editor and Director of Social Media at MatadorNetwork.comThe spiral-toothed male Arctic Narwhal whales are in big trouble.Broadcaster, Conservation BiologistGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"DEM TINDERBOX IGNITES",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
