The behavior that caused the mortgage bubble and financial crisis was a natural outcome and continuation of this pattern, rather than some kind of economic accident. It is important to understand that this behavior really is seriously criminal. This isn\u0027t about neglecting some bureaucratic formality.

None of this conduct was punished in any significant way.Read Post | CommentsReza Marashi, 05/23/12Research Director, National Iranian American CouncilThere is only one way to break a 34-year-old deadlock: break the rules.
