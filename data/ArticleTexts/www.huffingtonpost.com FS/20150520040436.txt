{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Author, \u0027Dangerous Ground\u0027Rather than blame Barack Obama or George W. Bush for the creation of ISIS, Americans should place the blame right where it belongs -- on the Saudi royal family. But then blame likewise must be apportioned to every American president who has acted to sustain America\u0027s oil-based relationship with the Saudis originally struck by Franklin Roosevelt -- Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush 41, Clinton, Bush 43 and Obama. Every president named was made aware of the unsavory nature of the Saud-Wahhabi alliance, and every president chose to ignore it. This wasn\u0027t because each president willfully turned a blind eye to the realities of the Saudi regime, but rather because American presidents are inherently political creatures who respond to the needs and desires of their electorate.Welcome news this week from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit. By a vote of 11 to 1, the court overturned its injunction against the controversial video called \"Innocence of Muslims\" that it had ordered off YouTube back in February 2014.Lecturer in Law at Stanford Law SchoolIf indeed accurate information is all they needed to have made the right decision on Iraq, it follows that they would have wanted accurate information if they could obtain it.Last person on Earth not on FacebookIn the early evening of May 20 the words \"used to be\" will be grafted to the end of my name. I will be referred to as \"the former director\" of Late Show With David Letterman. Along with the name change, comes the surrender of an all-access pass to New York City.Late Show with David Letterman, Director and Supervising ProducerWhen the Wall Street bubble burst in 2008 because of excessive risk-taking, millions of working Americans lost their jobs, health insurance, savings, and homes. But The Street is back to many of its old tricks. And its lobbyists are busily rolling back the Dodd-Frank Act, intended to prevent another crash.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Psychological research tells us that introspection is often a highly inaccurate source of self-knowledge. An over-reliance on introspection trips one up -- decreasing performance, reducing decision quality and even undermining self-insight.Research Editor at The Huffington PostTonight I\u0027m joined by New York Times columnist David Brooks, author of The Road to Character. In the book he explores how some of history\u0027s most influential figures built their strong inner character and what essential values they possessed that should be emphasized in today\u0027s world. In this clip he explains why the virtues discussed in his book transcend political affiliation.PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorPresident Obama and the Republican Senators know what they are doing. They are handing gifts to the business lobbies out of sight of the American people, and attacking the opponents of fast track as anti-trade or ignorant, when in fact the opponents are merely pro-public interest.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia UniversityThey say timing is everything in life. Well, if that\u0027s true, the timing of this legislation to approve fast-track trade authority could not be worse for middle-class families.Senior Member of the Senate Foreign Relations CommitteeWhen Mayor Ras Baraka joined a student protest on Newark\u0027s main drag last Wednesday, it was if New Jersey media had collectively decided they were going to silence the dissenting voices of Newark.Teacher and writer; blogger, curmudgucation.blogspot.comAccording to United Nations statistics, noncombatants are dying in greater numbers every year, with the Taliban and other insurgents responsible for 72 percent of those deaths through suicide attacks and the use of IEDs and other indiscriminate weapons.Senior researcher on Afghanistan at Human Rights WatchThere are few policies that show the split between elite opinion and everyone else as clearly as trade policy. On trade we see a remarkable convergence of the leadership of both parties against their base, with the elites firmly behind the leadership against what they view as the ignorance of the masses.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Remind me who, even among opponents and critics of the Bush administration\u0027s invasion of Iraq, ever imagined that the decision to take out Saddam Hussein\u0027s regime and occupy the country would lead to a terror caliphate in significant parts of Iraq and Syria that would conquer social media and spread like wildfire.Editor, TomDispatch.comWhile political bigwigs from both parties have publicly opposed big money in politics, they still plan on using heaps and heaps of it in the 2016 race. Unfortunately, their convictions on campaign reform are squeaking out from inside our currently screwed up political structure.Co-Founder, Ben \u0026 Jerry\u0027s Ice Cream and Head Stamper, StampStampede.orgIt is unfortunate that the world, particularly India, has not come together on the issue of poverty as it has on climate change. The two are interlinked. Therefore, I would urge India to keep in mind two questions when formulating the country\u0027s INDCs. Do our INDCs reflect our commitment to reduce carbon emissions with a view toward reducing poverty?Pioneer in women’s empowerment and grassroots development in India; founder of the Self-Employed Women’s Association and the Cooperative Bank of SEWAYour longtime love sees you through a filter of loving timelessness. They know that your soft tummy was caused by growing their babies, the lines by your eyes the product of shared laughs. To be middle-aged and single can be rather awkward, especially if you can\u0027t laugh about it.Author, contributing editor for Runner\u0027s World magazine, Runner, MotherThere is too much on the line for us to get caught up with minor differences. From racial disparity to income inequality, immigration reform, marriage equality, fair housing, job growth, pay equity, improved schools and much more, the challenges we face are real, and our commitment must be steadfast.President, National Action NetworkSometimes it\u0027s the not the things we need to start doing but the things we need to let go of doing that are holding us back from making progress and moving forward.Food Freedom Fighter, writer, speaker, wellness expert, founder of jennhand.com, and creator of Healing From Within.The question should not be whether the U.S. had faulty intelligence, but whether the existence of WMDs in Iraq alone should have been regarded as a casus belli -- as a justification for going to war against, and invading, a foreign country.Senior Analyst, WikistratThe issue in Iowa is not trade or no trade, as some apologists for Fast Track try to argue. The issue is what kind of ground rules do we want so that we can evaluate trade deals after 20 years of corporate trade agreements that mostly are meant to protect the investment profits of multinational corporations.President, Communications Workers of AmericaThe \"model minority\" label makes things worse for large sections of these communities, because their needs are often overlooked or misunderstood and then rarely addressed in government programs and by social-service organizations. Lack of disaggregated data perpetuates this label.Academic, Researcher, Writer, EntrepreneurAt the Cancer Prevention Summit on May 20th, 2015, experts in public health will challenge us all to consider what we could be doing better to prevent cancer. Most importantly, we need to commit to a collaborative effort, involving every segment of our society.Board-certified radiologist; Board member, Lesscancer; Author, \u0027A World Without Cancer\u0027In a small \"secret room\" on the 25th floor of the Virgin Hotel in Chicago, rock icons Marilyn Manson and Billy Corgan sat before an audience of a few dozen fans and journalists on Monday. We learned a lot about the Chicago-area native, particularly a few of his pet peeves. Here are a few things Billy isn\u0027t into.Chicago Editor, The Huffington PostWhen we talk about all of the problems we have on Earth and the need to solve them, it is only through such AI-human collaboration that we will gain the ability to solve our grandest challenges and truly create a world of abundance.Chairman/CEO, XPRIZEAfter causing a national fuss with \"Sorry, Babe, You\u0027re a Feminist\" and causing a scene with \"Boobs\" ...we\u0027re ready to chill. Need a little break too? Here are two sweet little things we\u0027d love to share with you:Award-winning comic, actress, author, creative coach, and social activistIf you watched, you\u0027re surely pondering the meaning of Draper/Whitman\u0027s latest and greatest incarnation as New Age pitchman of killer soft drinks. But I\u0027ve also given a lot of thought to something else: What was Mad Men trying to tell us about America?Author, \u0027Tear Down This Myth\u0027We thought it worthwhile to give props to seven more gastronomically obsessed towns.Everything worth caring about in food, drink, and travelThe account of unsavory chicanery in high places once again spotlights the deceit that now is the hallmark of how our government works. Here are a few crucial points essential to assessment of Seymour Hersh\u0027s interpretation.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghNEW YORK -- Ironically, in this era of exponential growth, we are witnessing the disappearance of cities. Our urbanism is becoming increasingly generic -- a Starbucks on every corner and an iPhone in every palm. We can do better.Distinguished Professor of Architecture, City College of New YorkWe are facing the decimation of entire small town economies, a disruption the likes of which we haven\u0027t seen since the construction of the interstate highway system itself bypassed entire towns. This time, it\u0027s different. This time, there\u0027s no need for entire towns to even exist at all.Writer and basic income advocateI didn’t expect Mad Men to tie everything up neatly — far from it, given what the show has been about for the past seven seasons. But let’s just say that some past season finales were more satisfying and resonant than the series finale was.TV critic, The Huffington PostGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
