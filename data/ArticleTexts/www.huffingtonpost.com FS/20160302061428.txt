{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressTypically, dreams of a contested (or if you must, \"brokered\") convention boil down to a raft of wishful thinking. And speaking of wishful thinking, how\u0027s that effort to stop Donald Trump from claiming the GOP nomination going? Yes, to borrow a tawdry cliche, this time it\u0027s different. As Trump has risen in the polls, the fears of the GOP establishment have escalated. Trump has been the best of friends to the contested convention fantasists because of his knack for pushing traumatized Republican Party fixers out of their warrens and into the pages of newspapers. The only real question is: How far would GOP elites go to thwart a Trump nomination? Today we\u0027ll consider the possibility that they\u0027ll issue a Code Black, and blow up their own convention from the inside.The damage done by money to politics isn\u0027t in the spending, it\u0027s in the giving. The net effect of all that political giving poses a direct threat to our American way of self-government and, with it, our ability to solve our collective problems. The marriage of great wealth and political influence has strangled the political process.Executive Director, Issue OneAuthor of Nation on the Take, to be published March 1, 2016Shin Lim\u0027s journey to the top of the magic world is one that would not have been possible in the days of David Copperfield. Lim is nearly completely self-taught, which is pretty rare in the magic community, because his family did not have the means to support his passion for magic.Empowering a new generation of digital voicesYour education is an investment in your future. It should help you get ahead. Right now, it\u0027s doing the opposite. It\u0027s not enough to make college more affordable -- we need to help people with the debt they already have.Democratic candidate for President; Former Secretary of State, U. S. Senator and First LadyWhether or not Donald Trump ultimately succeeds in winning the White House, historians are likely to rank him as the most consequential presidential candidate of at least the past half-century.Author, \u0027The Limits of Power: The End of American Exceptionalism\u0027With each passing day, Republicans continue to talk about their plans to deport millions of hardworking immigrants families. It is this type of anti-immigrant rhetoric that continues to divide our communities. The stakes could not be higher for the immigrant community.Undocumented Immigrant, Online Activist \u0026 BloggerTo those who say there is no political revolution, I say that if it\u0027s true then that\u0027s very sad -- because there should be. What\u0027s happening in the United States today is a corporate coup of the U.S. government, and anyone who isn\u0027t grieving that must not be looking.Author\"Read the small print\" is sound advice before buying car insurance or signing for a reverse mortgage touted in a late-night infomercial. It is also the right approach for making sense of Whole Women\u0027s Health v. Hellerstedt, the momentous abortion rights case from Texas now before the Supreme Court.Senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of LawBy this time tomorrow, the slumped figures of the walking dead may well clutter the Republican landscape. If so, the cause of death will look a lot like assisted suicide. The GOP\u0027s Kevorkian is, of course, Donald Trump.Novelist and contributing opinion writerMy name is Ameenah and I am 25 years old, yet somehow I feel much older. I have experienced the siege on Moadamiyeh by Assad\u0027s forces in 2013. It\u0027s an experience I can never forget. And it\u0027s happening again.Syrian advocate and human rights activistThe movie can be gritty and somewhat dark, but in the end it\u0027s hopeful. We made a difference. We helped some people abused by priests. Not everyone, but we did help. And that is tremendously gratifying.Research scientist, MIT Media Lab; former data reporter, Boston GlobeThe Supreme Court has had a clear pattern in its worst decisions: it has wrongly sided with the powerful interests in society over the powerless.Journal of Books and IdeasIt\u0027s not just a political or economical question, it\u0027s a moral question. Stand up. Fight back. You have a voice. Use it.Activist, Pussy Riot band memberEvery comedy show in the world can\u0027t replace the concerted, unified action by major cultural and political institutions necessary to depose the Donald and his supporters.Student at USC Gould School of Law. Lover of bow ties, hater of loud noises.Republicans have announced that they will not consider any Supreme Court justice nomination that the president brings them. This is part of an ongoing Republican attack on our form of government. The country has been through years and years of Republican obstruction of everything government does. Why is that?Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureEmperor Titus depicted himself in the crown of the triumphal Arch of Titus riding up to the heavens on the wings of an eagle. He was depicting himself becoming a god. While for different symbolic reasons, Trump also staged a photoshoot with an eagle. His results were less than deifying.Professor, AcademicNo, I was never bullied or called \u0027burnt\u0027, or compared to a monkey or a roach. I was never told by a boy that he didn\u0027t like me because of my skin color. But, being told by people that I wasn\u0027t black or I wasn\u0027t black enough took a different toll on me.Rising sophomore at Morgan State University studying multimedia journalismIt\u0027s hard for us to understand how someone poor and uneducated can be swindled into voting for someone who has never understood poverty or the lack of access to education. However, I understand Trump\u0027s appeal.Professor of Higher Education, University of Pennsylvania\u0027s Graduate School of EducationCritics across the ideological spectrum argue that occupational licensing regimes do little to protect consumers from incompetent practitioners and instead raise costs for consumers by stifling competition and imposing barriers to entry.Professor, Wake Forest Law SchoolWhy did Hillary take $11,000,000 in speaking fees during 2013-14? Because she believes there\u0027s nothing fundamentally wrong with the process of runaway inequality.Author, \"Runaway Inequality: An Activist\u0027s Guide to Economic Justice\"If we wait to address gun violence after the grieving is over, nothing will ever change, because the pain of having a loved one killed by gun violence never goes away.Survivor Fellow with Everytown for Gun SafetyPeriods do not have to be -- nor should they be -- an all-or-nothing issue. As far-fetched as it sounds, it is entirely possible to adequately fund research into menstrual pain and take it seriously as a medical condition without undermining women\u0027s capacity to fully function in society.Media funded and run by women.As it turns out, lots of openly queer people have won Oscars. But you know what? I don\u0027t mind that Sam Smith didn\u0027t know that. It\u0027s a good thing that we\u0027ve gotten to the point where it\u0027s possible to lose count of the number of openly queer people who\u0027ve won Academy Awards.Writer, photographer, explainer of the strange and wonderfulOur Federal government has temporarily lost its way, ignoring clear scientific warnings of extreme danger for young people, absurdly \"discounting\" the well-being of whole future generations for the sake of the few powerful individuals today, externalizing costs of fossil fuels today onto the backs of young people, babes, and the unborn.Climatologist and Adjunct Professor, Columbia University Earth InstituteThere is a near ZERO chance that the code created by Apple to break into their phones can stay private under current laws.Owner, Dallas Mavericks; Chairman, AXS TVAny semblance of playfulness has worn thin enough to reveal the trajectory of Donald Trump\u0027s verbal bullying towards physical aggression and violence. Make no mistake: we\u0027re seeing a microcosm of what we as a country would experience from a Trump presidency.Political organizer, community strategist, educator, allyAs the potential benefits of mindfulness in business settings become clearer, so too do the potential risks. If individuals misuse mindfulness strategies to disengage from stressful realities, they run the risk of avoiding essential considerations at work and making poor decisions as a result.Founder \u0026 Director of Leading Minds Executive Coaching, LLCTrump talks a big, hateful, game, but his views are disturbingly close to those that have too long been met with a warm welcome --or at least a blind eye -- in Washington.President, People For the American WayLibya was supposed to be a different kind of intervention, with a much lighter footprint, more enthusiastic international support, and a realistic hope for a secular democratic regime in the wake of the conflict. The results have been different from what happened in Iraq, but they have not necessarily been any better.Director, Arms and Security Project, Center for International PolicyThe decision to not spend more money on infrastructure did not involve any sort of normal trade-off. We did not get ourselves more health care or education spending because we didn\u0027t spend more money on infrastructure. We just kept millions of workers from being employed.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027I am skin. I am a heart with nerves and feelings. Every woman has different instructions, written in her eyes, in her tears. Waiting for someone who will read in-between the lines.Greek.Writer.Poet.
