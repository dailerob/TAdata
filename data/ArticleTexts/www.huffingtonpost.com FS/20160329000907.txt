{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorAs long as there\u0027s been trade, there\u0027s been imbalanced trade, as countries invariably produce more than they consume, i.e., they\u0027re run a trade surplus, while others, like us, will do the opposite. To somehow insist on balanced trade for all would be a huge policy mistake, one that would preclude billions of people from the reaping the benefits of trade, both as consumers and providers. But persistent deficits of the magnitude we\u0027ve had here in the U.S. have, in fact, been highly problematic, and they are a symptom of global imbalances. They cost workers in deficit countries jobs and incomes, and they are functions of man (and woman)-made savings gluts that contribute to global instability and investment bubbles.The fossil fuel industry\u0027s denial apparatus is in an anxious state that it may be exposed, but sunlight into the vile machine cannot come too soon.Democratic Senator from Rhode IslandAfter a year of global trekking to discover, nurture, nudge, prognosticate and congratulate all Oscar-worthy films, come April, I am left with the position of Monday morning quarterback.PublicistIt wasn\u0027t unpredictable that we\u0027d see a backlash to the historic breakthrough of the first black president and the long-overdue adoption of more progressive social values. It\u0027s less predictable how that backlash will play out in the long run.Author, NextDraft: The Day\u0027s Most Fascinating NewsIf any other industry took such drastic steps to hide obvious risks from its products, would they find such ready defenders in the editorial pages of Rupert Murdoch\u0027s Wall Street Journal?Director of Penn State Earth System Science Center; Author of \u0027Dire Predictions\u0027 and \u0027The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars\u0027Many believe that this is simply a law that is made to make sure that people are using the restrooms and facilities related to their biological sex. It is much more than that. One of the things that a lot of people fail to realize is some of the actual underwriting of the bill itself.Music producer and musicianIt\u0027s great that you\u0027re willing to learn, but the only way to do that is to start learning from us: the underprivileged trans women of color who face the brunt of institutionalized transphobia.Trans Rights Advocate, Musician, Volunteer Coordinator for STRIVE, Social Media Coordinator for the Florida Transgender Alliance, Vlogger, Nerd, Artist, Proud Feminist SlutThe West is in denial by refusing to acknowledge the obvious. There\u0027s no quick fix for defeating terrorism. The terrorism we see today is the descendant of many generations of intertwined missteps. The fallout has been global.Economist, Professor of Business and International Affairs at GW University, writer on Middle East Economies and Islamic economics-financeThis is the stunted generation -- young adults venturing into a world of work, loaded with student debt, unable to find stable jobs or decent careers. This is also the post-Cold War generation, for whom Soviet communism is a distant memory (along with reliable jobs).Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Rumor has it that President Obama is soon scheduled to travel to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. I only wish I could adequately relay the disgust I have in my heart when I anticipate having to see my president smiling, laughing, and joking with his \"special Saudi friends\" -- the very same people who I believe underwrote the murder of my husband and nearly 3,000 others.9/11 widow and activistHow do these events inform us about the future of nuclear power, or its place in addressing climate change? One view is that nuclear power is safe and cost-effective, with long periods of stability and reliability interrupted infrequently by accidents. The other view is that power from the atom is unsafe and costly, with catastrophic accidents separated by periods of stability leading to a false sense of security.Scientist and former White House Senior Policy Analyst; Ph.D. in neurophysiologyIf you do feel the need to persuade me that the testing ritual is excellent and worthwhile, you should know that I have heard most of your arguments, and, frankly, you need new ones.Director of Secondary Education and Secondary Special Education Teacher Preparation, Seton Hall UniversityTwo-thirds of all Civil War mortality, perhaps even higher on the rebel side, were not from battlefield injuries, but from contagious diseases which spread like veritable wildfire among stationery troops.Mike the Gun GuyMany health profession schools convey a \"make or break\" culture which causes many students to fear failure and crumble under the pressure because they wait too long to ask for help.University President, Clinical Psychologist, AuthorThose who insist Donald Trump has no foreign policy have simply not been listening. The \"Trump Doctrine\" is as clear as a reveille bugle piercing the dawn at Fort Bragg; and it\u0027s a page right out of Ronald Reagan\u0027s playbook.Author of Crouching Tiger and Death By China books and filmsThe political establishment, its Wall Street backers, and the major media have worked feverishly to turn the Democratic primary process into a coronation for Hillary Clinton. Here are 10 ways that establishment has sought to orchestrate the results, and why the race has a long ways to go.Executive director, National Nurses United (AFL-CIO) and California Nurses AssociationThe national news media have discovered that under the right circumstances -- meaning, in every important respect, with the wrong candidate -- campaigns can be good business for them too.Dean, UC Berkeley Graduate School of JournalismFor \u0027Fixer Upper\u0027: Drink if/when Jo says shiplap. Okay, this one may get you sick drunk. Keep a throw up bucket nearby... Jo really likes shiplap. Drink twice if they make a joke about shiplap or Jo\u0027s obsession with the white wood. Or, if Chip makes a joke about something sexual or his height.Fiction writer, blogger at Suburban Shit Show, staff writer at Club Mid and mom to four kids.For years before I began my medical transition, I was discriminated against in the restroom. Before I even knew that transitioning was a possibility, my gender was questioned in the restroom. These experiences are part of my life experience. These experiences traumatized and shaped me.Revolutionary trans* activist, organizer, and educatorEarlier this month, two high-profile men in the tennis world tried to set back women players a few decades. In any context, their misogynist comments are offensive. But they are particularly troublesome because tennis is a sport which has been uniquely progressive on gender equality.Blogs Editor, Huffington PostIn the twenty or so years since the days of the Stretch mobile, there has not been a time where I\u0027ve heard a Tribe song, especially a Phife Dawg verse, and not thought of my dad, and that tan Corolla. And I don\u0027t think there ever will be.Artist, writer, musician, student of the worldAs the election year progresses, many candidates in both parties and at every level will say it. Child-welfare professionals work mightily to make it a reality. Our country\u0027s laws and policies are intended to promote its essential truth: Every child deserves to grow up in a safe, permanent and loving family.President, National Center on Adoption and Permanency and Myriad Strategic PartnersIf you\u0027re a rightward-leaning white American, whether or not you harbor racial resentment is a powerful predictor of whether you support Donald Trump. Or, to put it more simply, Trump attracts white racists.Author of \u0027Obama’s America: A Transformative Vision of Our National Identity\u0027I know -- intellectually -- that I am a good person. But the disorder skews this perception, making everything about the shame of my outer appearance. How can I be a good person when I do this to myself?Media funded and run by women.I\u0027m done watching and listening -- without rebuttal -- to those who claim to be progressives and Democrats as they outrageously slam and slime a woman who\u0027s worked indefatigably for 40 years in support of essential and life-changing issues that I, and many others, support.Sass \u0026 SensibilitySeverely sanctioning North Korea appears to create enormous benefits for China\u0027s rivals but few advantages for China. Why would any rational leadership in Beijing go along with America Washington must make a compelling case to the PRC. The U.S. should begin by pointing out how unstable the current situation is, with an unpredictable, uncontrollable regime dedicated to creating a nuclear arsenal of undetermined sizeSenior Fellow, the Cato InstituteWho\u0027s the bully: Someone who retaliates in kind against a public figure? Or someone who targets innocent families and children with anti-LGBT policies and language claiming they somehow represent the fall of America?Co-founder, Outsports.comHe should be far less of a shock to this country than he continues to be. After all, a Trumpian world-in-formation has paved the way for him.Editor, TomDispatch.comWhile we\u0027re so busy focusing on what women should and should not do, there\u0027s a big problem going undiagnosed: entitlement syndrome. The opposite of imposter syndrome, entitlement syndrome is the problem of overconfident, mediocre white men.Feminist, writer, and messaging nerd.Much separates Trump and Sanders, yet both are willing to admit the times are bad for many hardworking Americans.  What they\u0027re saying is this: The American dream is increasingly a nightmare.Writer, Professor, Retired Lt. Colonel, Air ForceAlthough you wouldn\u0027t know it from the GOP\u0027s presidential candidates, there are signs that more conservatives are warming up to the idea that global warming is real and we really need to do something.Executive Director, Presidential Climate Action ProjectGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
