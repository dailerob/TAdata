{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, several stories reminded us that life is often a contest between our better angels and our demons. On the demon side, a suspect was arrested in the horrific death of a man thrown in front of a New York subway train. On the angel side, three days later, a pair of bystanders helped save a person who\u0027d fallen onto subway tracks. There was good news in Kate Middleton leaving the hospital, but bad news in the apparent suicide of the nurse who\u0027d put through a prank phone call seeking medical information about the pregnant princess. In Egypt, the Arab Spring turned to winter, as thousands protested President Morsi\u0027s attempt to consolidate power -- while back home there was continued fascination with the cop who gave boots to a vet wrestling with demons of his own. Officer DePrimo\u0027s selfless act of kindness grabbed our imagination, and summoned our better angels to help guide us through the holiday season.Read Post | CommentsOprah Winfrey, 12/04/12Chairman and CEO, Oprah Winfrey NetworkAt the end of each school year in South Africa -- which is right now -- I teach a class to the 12th graders at the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls. It\u0027s my last chance before they move out into the world of college and beyond to try and cram everything I wish someone had told me into a week\u0027s curriculum.Read Post | Comments (70)Adam Winkler, 12/07/12Professor of Law, UCLAFriday, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a landmark case challenging the constitutionality of California\u0027s ban on gay marriage. But don\u0027t count on a game-changing decision too quickly. It\u0027s more likely that Ted Olson and David Boies\u0027 blockbuster will end with a whimper.Read Post | Comments (1,086)Jim Wallis, 12/06/12Christian leader for social changeThe discussion we are having about \"the fiscal cliff\" is really a debate about our fiscal soul. What kind of nation do we want to be? We do need a path to fiscal sustainability, but will it include all of us -- especially the most vulnerable?Read Post | Comments (476)Arianna Huffington, 12/03/12Hey, have you heard about this thing called \"the fiscal cliff\"? Actually, the better question is: Have you heard about anything except the fiscal cliff?Read Post | Comments (280)Neil Young, 12/06/12Activist and rock legendFor survival of the planet and our way of life as human beings, we need to drastically reduce our carbon output. The approach being taken does not do that.Read Post | Comments (438)Lisa Belkin, 12/05/12Senior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, The Huffington PostThe space between the moment you learn you are pregnant and the one when you reveal that to the wider world is the most intimate time in a woman\u0027s life. You are quite literally carrying a secret.Read Post | Comments (73)Sir Ken Robinson, 12/07/12Consultant; Author, \u0027The Element: How Finding Your Passion Changes Everything\u0027We\u0027re all born with deep natural capacities for creativity, and systems of mass education tend to suppress them. It is increasingly urgent to cultivate these capacities and to rethink the dominant approaches to education to make sure that we do.Read Post | Comments (1,008)Marlo Thomas, 12/04/12Award-winning actress, author and activistAs the holidays approach I can already taste the fabulous holiday meals. But then anxiety rushes in when I think of all the weight I can gain from them -- and after trying so hard all year not to pack it on! But who can pass on all the scrumptious stuffing, creative casseroles and decadent desserts?!Read Post | Comments (30)Blake Page, 12/03/12Cadet, United States Military Academy at West PointI am five months from graduation. Choosing to resign at this point also carries significant risk. What could possibly compel me to pass over this incredible opportunity in exchange for such harsh penalties?Read Post | Comments (1,739)Linda Bergthold, 12/05/12Health policy consultantI\u0027m getting really tired of the hysteria over this so-called, somewhat media created, \"fiscal cliff.\" But I do think we are in for some changes in health care as a result of the discussions going on in Washington so here\u0027s what you should expect.Read Post | Comments (512)Paul Brandeis Raushenbush, 12/05/12Senior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostWhat are we to make of the morality tale of giving the homeless man a pair of shoes when the man is not homeless, has an undesirable past and has apparently discarded the shoes?Read Post | Comments (415)D.L. Hughley, 12/05/12Actor and stand-up comedianNo one likes kids blasting their crappy music. No one likes babies crying on airplanes either. But you don\u0027t get to kill them.Read Post | Comments (437)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 12/08/12Author, research psychologist and gender scholarAs absurd as it might sound to many, it\u0027s not easy being a rich kid. Their parents tend to have high expectations. They think their money is their most notable quality. And so they learn to use it -- to buy affection, or friends.Read Post | Comments (133)Dan Froomkin, 12/07/12Contributing editor, Nieman ReportsFearful of appearing biased, the elite political press failed to call sufficient attention to the Republican Party\u0027s radical agenda and disdain for facts. The result is that in the name of balance, the press actually put its thumb on the scale, and prevented a true reckoning.Read Post | Comments (670)Emma Jenner, 12/04/12Child development and behavioral specialistThe English are truly great at bringing up resilient, well-mannered, brave, and kind children. Too many parents -- in our own country and across the Western world -- have lost sight of what we\u0027ve always done right.Read Post | Comments (423)Josh Silver, 12/07/12CEO, United RepublicFor those of us who care less about partisanship and more about what our elected officials actually do -- or fail to do -- once in office, the 2012 election portends a bleak future.Read Post | Comments (87)Michael Shaw, 12/05/12Publisher of BagNewsNotes, topping LIFE.com\u0027s 2011 Best Photo BlogsBeyond the pitched cries of editorial impropriety, perhaps it\u0027s not all clear what the subway photo is really about. When you think about it, for example, what the photo offers is not the story of what happened so much as its consequence.Read Post | Comments (289)Christine Lagarde, 12/06/12Managing Director, IMFNext week, I will travel to Latin America -- my second visit to the region since November 2011. I return with increased optimism, as much of Latin America continues its impressive transformation that started a decade ago.Read Post | Comments (15)Geoffrey R. Stone, 12/07/12Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoThe time has come for all law enforcement organizations to support mandatory state laws that require the use of electronic recording systems during custodial interviews. This is a simple, sensible and effective way to improve our nation\u0027s system of criminal justice.Read Post | Comments (54)Leonard Maltin, 12/07/12Film critic and historianWith so many big, prestigious, Oscar-worthy movies crammed into the last few weeks of the year, it\u0027s challenging to find hidden gems now playing in theaters. But this gives me an opportunity to reach into my archival bag and pull out some lesser-known treats for the season.Read Post | CommentsNadia Cho, 12/07/12Student, University of California-BerkeleySex is the one of the few things that are constant and universal, and human beings aren\u0027t going to stop banging anytime soon, if ever. It would benefit everyone to view sex as something more natural in a positive light, rather than a super-scandalous forbidden phenomenon.Read Post | Comments (206)Dr. R. Keith Sawyer, 12/08/12Associate Professor, Washington University; Author, \u0027Group Genius: The Creative Power of Collaboration\u0027Many of us imagine that creativity involves a sudden flash of insight; that it comes as a gift, without much effort; and we believe that expertise and learning blocks creativity. But these beliefs are just myths.Read Post | Comments (22)Jessica Seinfeld, 12/07/12Author, \u0027Double Delicious! Good, Simple Food for Busy, Complicated Lives\u0027As we go about our busy lives during the holidays, it\u0027s my hope that we can also stop to consider the people whose lives remain in turmoil. The families affected by Hurricane Sandy were some of this country\u0027s most vulnerable.Read Post | Comments (14)Tom Engelhardt, 12/04/12Editor, TomDispatch.comDear President Obama, Don\u0027t these \"accomplishments\" of yours sometimes amaze you? Don\u0027t you ever wake up in the middle of the night wondering just who you are?Read Post | Comments (270)Mike Ryan, 12/04/12Senior Entertainment Writer, The Huffington PostYes, there\u0027s a new Hobbit movie coming out soon. (The first of three Hobbit movies, actually.) But, most of the buzz -- both good and bad -- stems from the fact that The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey will be shown on a special kind of film with a rate of 48 frames per second. Truth be told, I had no idea what this meant when it was first announced.Read Post | Comments (758)Ralph Goodale, 2012. 9.12Dr. Curtis L.
