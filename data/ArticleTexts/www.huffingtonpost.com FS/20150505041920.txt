{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027This week marks the fifth anniversary of the flash crash. For those who don\u0027t remember, the Flash Crash was when the stock market lost almost nine percent of its value from its opening level, with most of this decline occurring in a five-minute period. The market quickly recovered most of this loss. As long as you didn\u0027t sell stock in the 30-minute crash interval, you weren\u0027t affected by this plunge. But the crash did reveal the extraordinary instability in the stock market due to short-term trading. The issue of short-term trading is the key here. There was no event in the world that triggered the plunge. There was no outbreak of war, major terrorist incident, or natural disaster that sent stock prices plummeting. There wasn\u0027t even a bad profit report from a major company. The crash was based simply on program trading that fed back on itself, turning a downward blip into a major plunge.I am going to periodically suggest ideas that Hillary Clinton might consider -- both to establish that she is a real-deal progressive and to rally political support from voters whom the economy is leaving behind. Clinton might even outflank some leading progressives by going beyond what is considered politically safe in the current environment.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027So when I read about Freddie Gray, it brought the fight for change into focus. Yes, I can blog and tweet and march and hashtag -- and I will -- but as a political organizer by heart and habit, I believe my calling is to insist that the candidates I support take action to create jobs and justice.Chair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusI firmly believe that without Lisa, the negative education statistics that plague Latino communities would have become my sobering reality. Instead, Lisa was one of the first people who recognized my potential and instilled in me a passion for learning.Associate Editor to Arianna HuffingtonI\u0027m sure you want this whole episode behind you. I get that: I\u0027m related to the most successful transatlantic slave-trading dynasty in U.S. history.Executive director, Coming to the Table; Author, Inheriting the TradeAs thoroughly disgusting and hurtful as I may find Pamela Geller\u0027s views to be, she is totally correct that neither governments nor bullets nor bombs should block access to her ignorance or our right to publicly repudiate it -- or perhaps even ignore it -- for the hate that it is.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityThe more active America\u0027s foreign policy, the more the U.S. has to spend on the military: the \"defense\" budget is the price of Washington\u0027s foreign policy. American military personnel and contractors die. Enemies are created. A national security state develops.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteAs the object of repeated death threats during my PEN presidency, I can testify from personal experience that in times of violence, solidarity among writers is paramount.Mexican poet and environmentalistThis week, the Republican presidential field is going to double, from three candidates to six. Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and Marco Rubio have all previously officially announced their candidacies, and this week they will be joined by Carly Fiorina, Ben Carson, and Mike Huckabee.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comIf the Trans-Pacific Partnership is enacted, big corporations, Wall Street, and their top executives and shareholders will make out like bandits. Who will the bandits be stealing from? The rest of us.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027In the moments after an attack like the one in Garland, those of us who are working to create a pluralistic society where both free speech and respect for one another go hand-in-hand must redouble our conviction to create a stronger union.Executive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostWhen the media writes about rape allegations as merely an \"off-field distraction,\" or refers to Jameis Winston only as a \"controversial player,\" it\u0027s minimizing the impact of sexual violence. Rape is more than an off-field distraction, and to define it as such does an injustice to survivors.Director, Surviving in NumbersWalt Disney knew the power of vision. He created Walt Disney World in his mind and then led others to imagine and support his idea for a revolutionary theme-park experience. This is the essence of visionary thought leadership and the heart of what it takes to create a dream in this world.Author, Speaker, EntrepreneurLittlefinger is evil. And yet -- you should root for him to win. Why, you ask? Well, because he\u0027s good for Westeros, that\u0027s why. Don\u0027t let your petty and personal animosity for this self-made man to stop the wheels of history.Writer, author and bloggerJamie Foxx is being heavily criticized for his performance of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at Saturday night\u0027s fight. How about stopping this false display of patriotism altogether? What does two people beating the bejesus out of each other have to do with \"the rockets red glare\" and \"bombs bursting in air\"?Liberal political commentator, host of \"The Alan Colmes Show\" on Fox News Radio, publisher of alan.com, author of \"Thank the Liberals … For Saving America\"I hate to think people actually believe those stereotypes, but it\u0027s likely some do. Or maybe they simply don\u0027t stop to think about how hurtful and damaging those kinds of images can be.Minister, BuxMont Unitarian Universalist FellowshipOur nation owes a great debt to the young persons and older adults who protested against acts of actual or perceived police misconduct in Baltimore, Maryland; Staten Island, New York; Tulsa, Oklahoma; Ferguson, Missouri; Cleveland, Ohio; North Charleston, South Carolina; and other cities around the country. They are the moral conscience of our nation.Diversity Visiting Professor, University of San Francisco; and Scholar Writer in Residence, MLK, Jr. Institute, Stanford UniversityBrian Williams, whether he calls it a mistake, a conflation, an enhancement, or an exaggeration, told a lie. Not once, repeatedly. And publicly. And to his viewing audience.Professor of Journalism Law and EthicsIt is past time for family, friends, lawyers, legal associations and law schools to ask Alito and Scalia to halt and to answer the question \"Have you no sense of decency, sirs?\"Law Professor, Loyola University New Orleans, CCR Associate Legal DirectorAfter living in New York for five years, I recently moved to San Francisco. Neither city is clearly superior, but there are some distinct differences.Writer, comedian and creator of TheCooperReview.comFans of boxing deserve champions not only inside the ring, but also outside of it. Mayweather may have won this fight but it doesn\u0027t really matter. He could defeat 10 more Manny Pacquiao\u0027s but he will never be remembered the way Pacman will be -- as a true fighter. \"Money\" stands for nothing. He may be undefeated, but he is not a champion.Blogger; film and TV fan; graduate, Ateneo de Manila UniversityAs we bid a sad but fond farewell to this transformative and ground-breaking television series, I want to share with all my viewers and readers this classic Between the Lines episode.Host and Producer of Between the Lines with Barry Kibrick seen on PBS.Some people are naturally confident and self-assured. Unfortunately, I\u0027m not one of them -- and possibly neither are you. We want people to genuinely like us... but we want them to like the real us. Here are seven ways to be who you are -- and to be extraordinarily likable.Ghostwriter, speaker, Inc. Magazine Contributing EditorMasih Alinejad is well-known in Iran not only to the followers of her writing, but also to those whom she writes about. In 2014, Alinejad created My Stealthy Freedom, a platform that allows women in Iran to protest the strict law of obligatory hijab by posting pictures of themselves in public places without their headscarves.Traveller, writer, photographer.As long as people like Sens. Ron Johnson and Ted Cruz are working against LGBT equality, none of us should be giving them any cover, let alone raising money for them. We surely don\u0027t have the luxury to join them on other issues with which some of us may agree, not when they\u0027re trying to make us second-class citizens. And that\u0027s why the boycott against the hoteliers is so important.Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesCan you imagine what would happen if angry young men of color spouting insurrectionist rhetoric gathered outside a government building with handguns and assault rifles and prevented officials from doing their job?Executive Director, Coalition to Stop Gun ViolenceThe Unites States\u0027 continued commitment to capital punishment makes it unusual among developed nations.Department of Justice Studies, Montclair State UniversityWe, in Nepal today, are injured people. We have lost much. But not all. And to heal, we must get in touch with that portion of our lives that is not yet broken. In this, we have much to learn from the Haiti earthquake, where the largest aftershock came eight days after the main earthquake.Founder of kgnepal.com.np that encourages individuals to create social impact. Currently heads a high school in Nepal.Through various eccentric projects, like producing a radio show modeled after scenes from Shakespeare plays or constructing a raft similar to the one used by Huckleberry Finn, Mr. Morris created a world that felt exclusive to his particular classroomLaw student and writerOver the decades and through the generations, the phenomenon that is the Sunday New York Times has been an integral part of America\u0027s cultural scene as well as its news scene. The rooted domesticity of the 1950s may be long gone. In these febrile times, we are more indulgent of our impulsive strivings and our neuroses. But the Times is still our companion.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghIn the jazz-laden track, the woman represents the pressures and expectations that white America places on the black man. It\u0027s an ill-favored conflation of the relationship between black men and black women -- suggesting that in America, black men suffer an oppression that black women routinely serve to augment.Writer, media maven and a black queer trans feministGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"BAILOUT RECORD: IT\u0027S COMPLICATED",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
