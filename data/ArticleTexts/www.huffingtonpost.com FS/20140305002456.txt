While there are limits as to what Obama can based on executive authority alone, there are many areas where he can have an impact. He already identified one area in his State of the Union Address, when he announced that new federal contracts would require that workers be paid a higher minimum wage. This sort of action can be carried much further. Of course, negotiations mean that we are prepared to give up something. That seems like a small price to pay for the millions of jobs that could be created.Comments (42)Michael VlahosWriter and National Security expertWhat we are watching unfold before us is surely the hoped-for beginning of yet another Russian Renovatio -- and not just a dictator fantasy, but rather a collective desire -- \"The Body\" is being restored.Comments (16)Donna SpragueMother, wife of military veteran, unemployed nurseWe are at a loss as to what we will do now that the unemployment has just run out.

And now, this.Comments (112)Adam GrantWharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027In the past three months, readers have asked what\u0027s coming next.

The devil is indeed in the details.CommentsAdam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911Doctors are bound by the Hippocratic Oath to first do no harm and while they may be very good, or even the best, at what they do, the continuing parade of breach announcements in the health care area is a clear indication that many haven\u0027t a clue when it comes to information security.CommentsCandy SchulmanWriterWhile everyone was laughing at or tweeting how alarming Kim Novak and Goldie Hawn looked with their faces full of Botox, I could only think of a woman who never stood on the Academy Awards stage: my mother.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorIt\u0027s a detailed, serious look at the issue but is beset with misleading evidence and conclusions. There\u0027s also something that I found fundamentally odd about the report.Comments (38)Diana NyadLong-distance swimmer, journalist, and broadcasterSome behind-the-scenes snapshots from this morning\u0027s Good Morning America announcement of this season\u0027s cast of Dancing With The Stars.CommentsJames MooreBest selling author, TV political analystRegardless of the outcome of that case, Abbott ought to be harmed by his association with Nugent and the hypocrisy displayed by letting the rock \u0027n\u0027 roll embarrassment speak for his campaign.CommentsRana FloridaCEO, The Creative Class Group \u0026 Author, UpgradeMarch 8th marks International Women\u0027s Day, a time to celebrate the tremendous gains that women have achieved.

But here\u0027s a final observation -- a question, really -- before Sunday night\u0027s relatively unmemorable gala fades from memory forever. Why were the only two films to deal with financial scams also the two surprise shut-outs of the night?CommentsOla OjewumiFounder, Sacred Hearts Children’s Transplant Foundation and Project ASCENDThere are hundreds of little Lupitas across the globe that now believe they can achieve their dreams because of your presence as an astounding role model.

GirlsI, too, remember occurrences of feeling singled out by my peers solely due to my race.
