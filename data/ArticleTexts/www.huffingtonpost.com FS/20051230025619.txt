{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"From elections.donyell.netAll this week, along with our new posts, we\u0027re featuring some of our favorite blog posts from the past year. Today, it\u0027s the best of November and December -- months marked by rioting in France, Jack Murtha\u0027s dramatic stand on Iraq, Bob Woodward\u0027s Plamegate fiasco, and the NSA spying story. Enjoy this blast from the HuffPost past -- and be sure to check out The Blog for the latest current takes from our bloggers, including RJ Eskow on the Democrats and John Amato on Coulter and Lauer.READ POST | comments12.29.2005 John ZogbyThis president will most likely not see the positive side of 50% again. He banked his presidency and his political capital on the war in Iraq and is now at the mercy of things on the ground that are beyond his control.READ POST | comments (34)12.29.2005 Harry ShearerWe\u0027ve heard a lot of stories about the CIA practicing \"extraordinary rendition.\" Now come reports that the UK government may have been doing the same thing.READ POST | comments (14)11.11.2005 John CusackAre the Democrats going to offer an alternative plan to get us out of Iraq? Or are they going to wait for the Republicans to do it their way, reap the political dividends, and leave the Democrats sniping outside the palace gate?READ POST | comments (471)12.07.2005 Nora EphronHillary and Condi are starting to blur together in my brain. As they inch their way toward the middle, both blowing smoke, it’s hard to know which of them I’m more irritated by.READ POST | comments (71)12.18.2005 Vice Prime Minister Ehud OlmertAs painful as it was, we realized that we could not continue to implement the Prime Minister’s vision for a better future with the current party situation and hence, Kadima was born.READ POST | comments (79)11.20.2005 Sen. Edward M. KennedyWal-Mart sells itself as the all-American company, but it violates American family values every single day.READ POST | comments (110)12.02.2005 Lyn Davis LearIf this report got the attention it deserves and broke through the static of our 500-channel universe, it could be the coup de grace of the Bush White House.READ POST | comments (148)11.29.2005 David MametREAD POST | comments (65)11.29.2005 David ReesThank God the Iraq war has been such a BLOODY, MISMANAGED DISASTER, because we now know for sure that Saddamists and fundamentalists are capable of forming alliances! HOORAY!READ POST | comments (113)11.17.2005 Marty KaplanIt turns out that investigative reporters have the same right to clam up or spin when they\u0027re interviewed as White House press secretaries, oil barons and starlets do.READ POST | comments (66)11.30.2005 Robert ScheerSo, it is mission impossible that Bush has accomplished: A terminally inept U.S. occupation of Iraq now threatens to make the despot we overthrew look good by comparison.READ POST | comments (104)12.17.2005 Jane SmileyIs Bush in a bubble? Is Bush a dry drunk? Is Bush a drunk drunk? Is Bush a narcissist? Is Bush an idiot? Is Bush a madman?READ POST | comments (94)12.14.2005 Jerry and Joe LongThis appears to be the transcript of a dialogue between Brian Of Lamb, the host of Scroll Notes, who was considered the finest interviewer of the first century A.D., and St. Paul, the father of modern Christianity.READ POST | comments (121)11.28.2005 Arianna HuffingtonHow did Woodward, supposedly the preeminent investigative reporter of our time, miss the biggest story of our time -- a story that was taking place right under his nose?READ POST | comments (138)12.16.2005 Martin GarbusToday, for two separate reasons, has been an incredible day in America. First, the United States has legitimized torture and secondly, the President has admitted to an impeachable offense.READ POST | comments (166)12.21.2005 Adam McKayDoes Dick Cheney know he\u0027s evil? I mean it. Does he occasionally look up from his breakfast of one hard boiled egg and a plate of heart pills and say to himself, \"Man, I\u0027m an evil fuck”?READ POST | comments (106)11.23.2005 Rep. John MurthaThe American people are ahead of Congress in recognizing that we must give the Iraqis incentive to step up and seize their own destiny so that our young men and women in uniform will not continue paying such a heavy price for an indefinite period.READ POST | comments (479)11.26.2005 Jeff JarvisThe last thing we need is for more public officials to act as if they can or should throw their weight around with the press, the media, and our speech.READ POST | comments (42)12.16.2005 Norman LearSo tell me Lord: In the Bible, you were known to test societies by forcing them to endure tribulations for seven years. Does this mean that we have only two more years to go?READ POST | comments (79)12.07.2005 Lawrence O\u0027DonnellIf Fitzgerald does not indict Rove after hearing from Viveca Novak, then it will be Viveca Novak who saves Rove. Which is to say it will be Luskin’s relationship with the press, with Viveca Novak in particular, that saved Rove.READ POST | comments (70)11.29.2005 Trey EllisNow that we tax payers own Congressman Randy \"Duke\" Cunningham\u0027s mansion, let\u0027s turn it into a Museum of Corruption.READ POST | comments (33)11.04.2005 Patt MorrisonDid you notice how subtly, how adroitly, the powers that be have already jumped the line into the avian flu lifeboats?READ POST | comments (48)12.06.2005 Max ClelandThe angry rhetoric on Fox News Monday night seemed all too familiar. John O\u0027Neill decided that instead of debating the merits of the war, he would instead point blame on Senator Kerry.READ POST | comments (92)12.04.2005 Bradley WhitfordI am proud to be a part of a congregation that seeks to hold all public officials to their easy— and too often empty—proclamations of faith.READ POST | comments (183)12.08.2005 Stephen Gaghan\u0027Inducement.\u0027 It’s against the law in America. But in order to stay competitive in the global natural resource biz, you better be prepared to induce, early and often.READ POST | comments (74)11.16.2005 Michael SmerconishI say do whatever is necessary to get terrorists to talk. Waterboard them. Strap them to a pig. Do whatever it takes.READ POST | comments (268)12.02.2005 Deepak ChopraJesus seems to have been hijacked in the service of intolerance, bigotry, and war.READ POST | comments (381)11.20.2005 Tom GilroySaying to themselves, ‘hmm, I don’t know, in my heart, something smells funny about this whole wallowing in your own piss and shit thingy,’ five of our leftist bleeding hearts okayed practices that would give Hitler a hard-on.READ POST | comments (70)12.11.2005 Dan PasternackIt’s often been said that only the truth is funny and Richard Pryor was both painfully truthful in his work and painfully funny.READ POST | comments11.01.2005 Seth GreenlandIn a publicity coup even Bill Clinton would envy, Scooter Libby has placed himself squarely on the literary map. Last week, the world had no idea he had written a novel.READ POST | comments (11)11.16.2005 Dal LaMagnaExcept for his cancer, Derek Lamb was the healthiest person I knew.READ POST | comments (18)11.21.2005 Bill MoyersWith the corporate, political and religious right now exercising a one-party monopoly over Washington, we are going to see such a spectacle of corruption that muckraking journalism could yet produce a new Golden Age of investigative reporting.READ POST | comments (72)AP/Mikhail GrachyevFrom answers.comReutersAP/Peter DejongAP/Taylor JonesFrom nytimes.comLogin to Huffington Post  |  Make Huff Post your Home Page  |  RSS/XML  |  Sitemap  |  Advertising  |  JobsCopyright 2005 © HuffingtonPost.com, LLC   |  User Agreement  |  Privacy  |  Comment Policy  |  Powered by MovableType","h1":"",".title":"","h2":"The Year in HuffPo Blog PostsThe Myths of KatrinaCourage for the New YearHow Republicans Are Like Michael Jackson FansThe Year in HuffPo Blog PostsKurds Prepare for SplitsvilleGeorge W.
