{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor of Diplomacy at Occidental College and former US ambassadorRather than worrying about the depressing scenario of a Romney administration, I prefer to assume that Obama will win, probably a narrow victory, with the House remaining in Republican hands, and the Senate still under narrow Democratic control. This is recipe for gridlock and endless partisan bickering unless Obama can step up his game as president. What can we expect? The signals from the Obama White House and political team are not encouraging. They are understandably cautious and focused on winning re-election as opposed to laying out a clear and inspiring agenda for a second term. But we should expect more of him than he has shown in his first term. We should hold him to a standard of fighting leadership which the seriousness of the issues of our times requires -- and make his legacy one we fight for and will be proud of.Read Post | Comments (297)Bob Cesca, 08/08/12Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez Show, Media ProducerOver the weekend, Mitt Romney, while clearly benefiting from Republican voter purges and Voter ID laws meant to discourage minority and working class voters, accused the Obama Justice Department of somehow trying to disenfranchise military voters -- his biggest lie yet.Read Post | Comments (31)Howard Fineman, 08/07/12Editorial Director, AOL Huffington Post Media GroupI have news to report: Rush Limbaugh has finally had it with me.
