{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Chief financial writer, The Huffington PostYou\u0027ve probably always thought of inflation as a bad thing, but in some cases inflation can be a good thing. Let\u0027s say, oh I don\u0027t know, your economy has been a Lovecraftian nightmare hell for workers for the past five years, with nobody ever getting raises, aside from evil, hairless-cat-stroking CEOs. Does that sound like an economy you might know personally? If companies can raise prices and get away with it, then maybe they\u0027ll feel better about raising wages. And/or if wages start rising, then that gives people more money, which they can then spend on stuff, which could also cause prices to go higher.Historians will one day look back and ask how U.S. Middle East policy could be so ineffectual and so at odds with its professed values -- not to mention its strategic interests. The answer lies in the basic nature of the American political system, which permits well-organized and well-funded special interest groups to wield significant power on Capitol Hill and in the White House.Professor of International Affairs, Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of GovernmentIf established climate science, unfolding in real time before our eyes, does not prevail in this debate, then the fate of the world may look a lot like the dystopia popular in much of current cinema.Singer; Actress; Director; Composer; ActivistThe \"market\" may be a fine way to price corn or beans, but by itself it is not an appropriate way to price wages. That\u0027s because people are not commodities. Their well-being is the point of the economy. Everyone who works for a living deserves a living wage.Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersThe writing is clearly on the wall about what lies ahead. Yet even the most brilliant economists -- and futurists -- don\u0027t know what to do about it.Academic, Researcher, Writer, EntrepreneurI believe the criminal justice system has been heroic in its problem solving justice innovations. These strategies are smart, cost-effective and save lives. Yet these strategies alone cannot wholly reverse the criminalization crisis. Nor were they intended to.Created first Mental Health Court to decriminalize mentally illI absolutely adore children. Or rather, I adore them as long as I can escape from them at the end of the day. And I think that is perfectly OK.Journalist, blogger, rugby player and college student, while maintaining sobriety.After watching continuous acts of police abuse and brutality from coast-to-coast, perhaps the real question is, have we reached a point where federal authorities need to step in?President, National Action NetworkBy making these assertions in a highly visible public forum, Yellen was using the power of the Fed\u0027s megaphone to stem the growth of incipient bubbles. This is an approach that some of us have advocated for close to 20 years.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027I wanted to cut out the commiserating most of us use for 30-40 percent of all conversation (if you don\u0027t believe me, keep track of how many people start conversations with you in the next 24 hours that center on a complaint or criticism).Author of \u0027The 4-Hour Workweek\u0027No one thinks that this is something that could happen to them. No nurse thinks this is going to be her patient. But it can happen, it does happen, and it is happening every day in the United States.Registered nurse behind the blog Adventures of a Labor Nurse: the Highs and Lows of Labor and DeliveryHistorically, nations have responded to terrorist threats and attacks with a combination of police action and political negotiation, while military action has played only a minor role. President Bush opted instead for a policy that the United States alone among nations could have conceivably undertaken.Former fellow at the Nation InstituteIf Rahm can\u0027t save Chicago, then he can forget about running the country.Husband. Father. Policy wonk. Vice President of Policy at Illinois Policy.For those with bipolar disorder, it\u0027s an empowering message: No longer are you a prisoner of your genetics, thought to play a key role in the disorder. And through healthier lifestyle choices, you may be able to decrease your reliance on medication to manage your illness.Internationally recognized health expert, physician, scientist, and New York Times best-selling author. Known as \u0027the doc who walks the talk\u0027.Perhaps the terrible truth of drug war violence will finally be addressed as all of America bore witness this summer to the horror of some 52,000 unaccompanied children who were fleeing devastating violence that had erupted in Central America.Award-Winning Author and JournalistMovement Building Team, Drug Policy AllianceIt is difficult to watch a war in real time. And the facts, and the causes, and the solutions all play second fiddle to the horror and tragedy of war. It makes compelling TV. And we learn nothing.Academy Award-winning director, screenwriter and producerA handy new guide to charter school messaging ensures that never again will you accidentally say *market share* when you mean *student share* or *businesses* when what you really meant to mean all along was *schools.*Public education advocate and blogger, EduShysterWhen you examine the two sets of facts, the press treatment and the gaping media double standards in play for Giuliani and Clinton could not be more vivid: The D.C. press holds the Clintons, and Democrats, to a much tougher standard than they do Republican candidates.Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaDon\u0027t let your elected officials succumb to the pressure of a few hypocrites/bigots with loud microphones. Hear these immigrants out the same way that this nation\u0027s Indigenous people heard this nation\u0027s white ancestors out. That\u0027s what the Wilberforce Act requires.Author, attorney, and member of the Blackfeet Nation and Suquamish territoriesThere are certainly plenty of other hotspots and danger zones across the globe through which flights have passed daily for years without incident. This is due to several known factors.Travel blogger, published author, TV commentator, \u0026 travel company CEOHave you all completely lost your minds? Have we forgotten these are all human beings? Have we all decided to jointly support death and insure our unceremonious demise?Stay humanEd Miliband\u0027s visit to Washington DC provides a timely reminder of the new post-crash challenges faced by both our nations and our progressive movements. But beyond that, it is an opportunity for two leaders who both understand that economic growth comes from not the top down, but the middle out, and who share with common values, to share ideas on how to meet these challenges.Shadow Cabinet Minister, Labour peer and an adviser to Ed MilibandShadow Cabinet Minister, Labour peer and an adviser to Ed MilibandWe honor loss by individualizing it. That\u0027s what we need to do for each of the 298 souls lost. These events are reminders of how important peace is to us. These bodies remind us of the importance of life.Loss specialist and co-author with Elisabeth Kubler RossThe longer the war goes, especially Israel\u0027s ground offensive, the more likely that all Palestinians, even those in the West Bank, could rally around Hamas.Foreign PolicyNo matter what nonsense Rand Paul and the NRA promote about how doctors are a threat to the 2nd Amendment, anyone who believes that an unlocked gun in a home with children isn\u0027t a health risk is presenting a degree of stupidity that no amount of medical care will ever cure.Mike the Gun GuyOn Monday June 2, 2014, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed a regulation that would cut carbon pollution from power plants up to 30 percent by 2030. Within hours, House Speaker John Boehner delivered his response.Former Director, Office of Transportation and Air Quality, U.S. Environmental Protection AgencyDisclosure is the solution to much of what ails our democracy, not the problem. Those in Congress who are opponents of transparency not only trample on the right of Americans to know who is trying to influence our vote; they run afoul of the very nature of free and open elections.Government affairs lobbyist, Public CitizenChaos is inevitable, and life is not always going to fall into place seamlessly. While the messy parts of life may not always be resolved positively, there is always a chance you\u0027ll find a rainbow at the end of the storm.Writer, coffee-addict and lover of being outdoorsI thought Sullivan\u0027s argument made a lot of sense. What he\u0027s really talking about is the importance of mirrors -- that kids need to see their own lives and cultural experiences reflected in those who teach them.Chicago teacher, authorQuick fixes can lead to quick results that quickly vanish. If you want lasting change, it\u0027s time to let go of instant gratification BS and find a new way to live. You can love how you look and feel (permanently) by developing decent habits that become second nature to you.National fitness expert, speaker, contributor to Prevention magazine, author of several books and fitness DVDsThere are steps we can take right now to address this growing gap. The first is to raise our minimum wage to a living wage. No one who works full time should have to live in poverty. Increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 would lift millions out of poverty, ease some of the burden on our social safety net, and put more money into our local economy.Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"NO SMOKING GUN",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
