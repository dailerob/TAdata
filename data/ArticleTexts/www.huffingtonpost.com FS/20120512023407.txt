{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Founder, Define AmericanDiversity is destiny in 21st century America. More women will hold positions of power. African Americans will keep breaking barriers. Demographically, the country will look more Latino and more Asian -- most of them documented, many of them without papers. And more members of the LGBT community, of all colors, not just gay and lesbian but also transgender people, will continue to come out, insisting that they, too, be seen as fully human, capable of love and worthy of marriage. A different American majority is emerging, and what it means to be a minority in a country that will soon be minority-majority is being redefined.Read Post | CommentsGreta Van Susteren, 05/11/12Host of Fox News\u0027 \u0027On the Record with Greta Van Susteren\u0027Everyone (yes, everyone!) wanted that interview with President Obama this week (I would have loved it).
