Any mention of restoring this time-tested principle to the Internet causes fits among phone and cable industry lobbyists. It\u0027s a debate now raging throughout the record number of comments filed at the Federal Communications Commission, which has put the issue of common carriage back \"on the table\" as it weighs new rules to protect Net Neutrality. The conversation has also spilled into the media, where attacking common carriage has become fodder for industry-friendly editorial writers and pundits.

And the spectre of climate change stares you in the face as you tour the park.Director of Penn State Earth System Science Center; Author of \u0027Dire Predictions\u0027 and \u0027The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars\u0027Social gestures are important to feel welcome, express trust, show gratitude, and conclude visits with a hopeful tone. Find the best way between you and your doctor to have these feelings, but do not increase your risk of infection in the process.Practicing hematologist and medical oncologistTwo states down, forty-eight to go. One country down, and 195 to go. Ultimate victory is far from assured.

For Israelis and for those truly interested in a positive future for Gaza, it is essential to understand that Hamas and the Palestinians who live there are not one and the same.Fmr.

The question is: how can we collectively reach an unsatisfactory conclusion and come out as honorable people?Senior researcher, Microsoft Research; Research Assistant Professor, New York UniversityLiberals who foolishly thought they\u0027d won on August 8, 1974, have spent most of the last 40 years on the defensive, failed by stubborn hubris as Vietnam became Iraq, as B-52s became drones, as segregation became the mass incarceration of young American blacks, as J. Edgar Hoover\u0027s FBI became the NSA of Dick Cheney... and Barack Obama.Author, \u0027Tear Down This Myth\u0027Basically, porn is a terrible place to learn about how to have great, satisfying sex, and what that kind of sex looks like.
