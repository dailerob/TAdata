{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonSolvitur ambulando -- \"it is solved by walking.\" This phrase refers to the 4th-century-B.C. Greek philosopher Diogenes\u0027s response to the question of whether motion is real: \"It is solved by walking.\" As it turns out, there are many other problems that walking is the solution to. In our culture of overwork, burnout, and exhaustion, how do we tap into our creativity, our wisdom, our capacity for wonder, our well-being and our ability to connect with what we really value?Comments (19)David BromwichProfessor of Literature, Yale UniversityThe way out of war is always peace. The way out is not limited, well-tailored, well-spoken, discreet, \"smart\" shots across the bow which you pretend are not acts of war. But peace comes from negotiations: an activity of which this president has always spoken in high terms but at which he has shown few results during five years in office.CommentsBob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowDr. King challenged the United States to do better; to make good on the \"promissory note\" of our founding documents, while warning that we should never revisit the grotesque sins of our collective past. But we still have so much work to do.CommentsJennifer Ketchambecomingjennie.comIf you are a parent, you might want to take notes, because this has more to do with you than you may wish to admit. In fact, these are the reasons why your daughter wants to be a porn star.Comments (393)Gwen CooperAuthor, \u0027Homer\u0027s Odyssey: A Fearless Feline Tale, or How I Learned About Love and Life with a Blind Wonder Cat\u0027As I mourn Homer\u0027s death, I celebrate his life. Who could have foreseen, when I first adopted him as a tiny, blind kitten, all the lives he would touch, all the people who would love him, how much of a difference his life would make?Comments (36)Babble.comMy husband recently wrote on Babble about our struggle with the news that we\u0027re expecting twins. His essay received a lot of comments -- mostly negative. While I share my husband\u0027s sentiments, I wanted to tell my own version of our experience.Comments (348)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureOne of the under-reported stories of our time is the slow disappearance of the middle class and the loss of social mobility. The critical question is why? Why has the economy failed so many people, and what can be done about it?Comments (945)Tamara Shayne KagelWriter, Lawyer, Dancer, BloggerIf a 20-year-old man had performed the exact same dance moves up there would he be called out of control? Yes, she went a little overboard with her sexuality, but it shouldn\u0027t come as a surprise that most girls do around that age.Comments (199)Adam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; founder of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911While it\u0027s unsettling to have your car invaded or stolen while you\u0027re on a Labor Day trip with your family, it\u0027s not life threatening. What scares me is when a car hacker evolves from messing with your doors to invading your car\u0027s computer system.Comments (38)Cassie Premo SteeleAuthor, poet and columnistHe said, \"What is it?\" What he meant was What\u0027s wrong with you? Why is everything I do wrong? Why don\u0027t we laugh anymore?Comments (1,299)Jeff DanzigerPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideComments (40)Kirk DouglasActorI haven\u0027t smoked in over 40 years (I am 96 years old). Of all the drugs, smoking has the highest death rate -- more than 400,000 people per year (which is more than AIDS, alcohol, car accidents, illegal drugs, murders and suicides combined). Stop smoking and live longer!Comments (269)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesI recently married the man I\u0027ve been in a relationship with for 18 years. People ask if life is \"different\" now that we\u0027re \"legal.\" The answer is mostly no. One change, however, that is very real is the mild dilemma of how we call one another.Comments (220)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027A few days ago I had breakfast with a man who had been one of my mentors in college, who participated in the struggle for civil rights in the 1960s. Now in his mid-80s, he\u0027s still active. I asked him if he thought America would ever achieve true equality of opportunity.Comments (80)Rachel Campos-DuffyParenting expert, author, blogger, political pundit and television personalityThis week, Miley moved the ball deeper down the cultural cesspool. In that dreadful performance we witnessed the cannibalization of what is most beautiful about our gender.Comments (33)El GuapoSatirist; Founder of The Daily Refried; \u0027Official Latino Spokesperson/model; Prophet\u0027The turmoil that has engulfed Egypt and Syria in recent weeks is similar, experts argue, to the chaos unleashed on viewers during last week\u0027s MTV Video Music awards when former child star Miley Cyrus gyrated, off-rhythm on the crotch of who one can only guess was a lost, off-duty NFL referee.CommentsEric E. SterlingPresident, Criminal Justice Policy FoundationThis announcement is the recognition by the U.S. Department of Justice, which has been the primary obstacle for reform of marijuana laws for 40 years, that the political reality has changed.CommentsLauren GolinFood blogger, WithRawIntentions.comEver since I picked up this awesome popsicle mold, I\u0027ve been having way too much fun experimenting with sweet and even savory ice pop recipes. Patience is a virtue with these yummy snacks but trust me, all are well worth the wait!CommentsAnna SzymanskiWriterIt was like when you turn on a TV set after spending a significant period of time streaming television online. Suddenly, you\u0027re covering your ears and asking why those Kia hamsters can\u0027t play a different song. You never used to notice the commercials, but now they\u0027re all you can hear.Comments (36)Amb. Marc GinsbergFmr. U.S. Ambassador to Morocco \u0026 White House Middle East AdviserDamascus is eerily calm tonight. Although the war drums are beating, the exact timing of the attack, should it come, remains a mystery.Comments (193)Suzanne PerrymanBlogger at SpecialNeedsMom.comIn your hurry to keep things neat and orderly, you didn\u0027t see the whole picture. You didn\u0027t see the wheelchair lift permanently installed into the back of my SUV, and you didn\u0027t see me unload my little girl\u0027s pink manual wheelchair that we use for \"quick\" trips.Comments (6,975)Robert BrusteinPlaywright, director, actor, educator, theater founderAfter all the second-guessing, racial sneers, personal abuse, and, yes, shameless bullying, has evaporated into the sinkhole of oblivion, Barack Obama will go down as one of the most intelligent, compassionate, and visionary presidents in our history.Comments (166)Bob ComisWriter, farmerFor most of my life, all of my life, in fact, I have had an intense desire to be extraordinary -- not just to stand out from the crowd. But is in the very ordinariness of farming that I have found contentment.Comments (25)Zac HillAuthor, journalist, Luce Scholar, consultant, game designer, intrapreneur.I think Miley Cyrus\u0027 VMA performance totally ruled, and was totally awesome, and was a successful indictment of all the absurd societal constructions that have defined the environment inside which Miley became a cultural juggernaut.CommentsValerie JarrettSenior Advisor and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsAs we reflect on the tremendous progress made over the past half-century, we honor those brave leaders who paved the way, and upon whose shoulders we all stand, by recognizing our responsibility to undertake the immense job still at hand.Comments (63)Robert L. BorosagePresident, Institute for America\u0027s FutureAccountability or experience, corruption or insight, boys club or equal opportunity, \"no reason\" or many reasons? In the Looking Glass World of Wall Street and Washington, critics and defenders will not agree.Comments (11)Simon HigbyAdvertising, DDB StockholmAll around him people said he was mad. Despite that, inventor Kobayashi San persisted. That is one of the traits of a true leader: Having a goal and going for it with such vigor and conviction that others will follow -- even an entire corporation like Honda.CommentsKristen LambAuthor, \u0027Rise of the Machines -- Human Authors in a Digital World\u0027There are a lot of hurdles to writing great fiction, which is why it\u0027s always important to keep reading and writing. If you can get rid of these common offenders on your own, then good editors can focus on the deeper aspects of your fiction.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThe evidence shows that Dr. King was right. Full employment is a substantial part of what it will take to achieve economic justice.Comments (137)Conde Nast TravelerCondeNastTraveler.comIn 2008, a Russian newspaper and TV channel held a massive competition to name the official \"Seven Wonders of Russia.\" Topping the list was a place that few international tourists visit due to its remote location.CommentsElla Frances SandersIntern, MaptiaAs Friedrich Nietzsche said, \"Words are but symbols for the relations of things to one another and to us; nowhere do they touch upon the absolute truth.\" Here, illustrated, are 11 words whose concepts cannot be properly explained across cultures.Comments (205)David Bromwich, 2013.29.08Rebecca Wolf DiBiase, 2013.29.08Bob Cesca, 2013.29.08Matthew Bershadker, 2013.29.08Jonathan Granoff, 2013.29.08Liquor.com, 2013.29.08Caitlyn Becker, 2013.29.08William Bradley, 2013.29.08Katherine Hawkins, 2013.29.08Kari Haugeto, 2013.29.08Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"UK SHOOTS DOWN WAR",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
