{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna Huffington\"The tragedy and the pain that brings us here today is extraordinary,\" President Obama said Sunday, eulogizing the 12 men and women killed in the Washington Navy Yard shooting. \"It is unique. The lives that were taken from us were unique. The memories their loved ones carry are unique, and they will carry them and endure long after the news cameras are gone.\" He spoke of what they gave, how they connected, how much they meant to the lives of the people around them, small kindnesses, lifelong passions, and what made them laugh. For most of us, our eulogy will be not just the first formal marking down of what our lives were about but the only one. The eulogy is the foundational document of our legacy, of how people remember us, of how we live on in the minds and hearts of others. So the question is: why do we spend so much time on what our eulogy is not going to be?CommentsRobert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Now it gets really interesting. Republicans in the House are determined to shut down the government, by holding defunding of Obamacare hostage for continued funding of the rest of the budget. In past budget negotiations, Obama has often been too quick to fold a strong hand. But this time, the Tea Party badly miscalculated. They targeted Obama\u0027s personal crown jewel, the one piece of progressive social legislation that the president won\u0027t throw under the bus. So a showdown is increasingly likely, and Democrats could well win it.Comments (1,167)Maureen RyanTV critic, The Huffington PostThe man loved his family, and still does, but were they ever more important to him than trying to be top dog? No.Comments (650)John PavleyCTO @ The Huffington Post, BloggerOver the last few days I\u0027ve listened to the \"same\" radio stations on both iTunes and Spotify. I\u0027ve streamed music with wired, wireless and 3G connections. I\u0027ve used headphones and speakers. I\u0027ve created custom stations. I\u0027m looking at variety, fit, quality, convenience and user experience.Comments (30)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkAfter a week which began with 12 killed at a Navy Yard shooting in Washington, and continued with 13 shot at a South Side park in Chicago, we still can\u0027t get Congress to pass legislation on background checks.Comments (211)Kate BartolottaKindness costs us nothing and pays exponential dividends. I can\u0027t save the whole world. I can\u0027t bring peace to Syria. I can\u0027t fix the environment or the health care system, and from the looks of it, I may end up burning my dinner. But I can be kind.Comments (125)Elliott NeginDirector of News \u0026 Commentary, Union of Concerned ScientistsA number of industries have been trying to exploit the jobless economic recovery by claiming they could create millions of jobs if the government would just get out of the way.

But none of these problems changes the fact that the ACA is an enormous step forward.CommentsChristopher RosenEntertainment editor, Huffington PostNeil Patrick Harris brought his B-minus game the show featured a five-minute interpretive dance segment in the last hour of the broadcast, and there were so many memorial segments that \"Modern Family\" co-creator Steve Levitan was compelled to declare the 2013 Emmys \"the saddest of all time.\" Yet despite all that, Sunday night\u0027s Emmy Awards were still more engaging, heartfelt and celebratory than this year\u0027s Oscars.Comments (27)Simran Jeet SinghDoctoral Candidate in Religion, Columbia UniversityUnfortunately, his assailants did not see Prabhjot Singh, the professor, the community health expert or the local doctor.

Unfortunately, there\u0027s only one problem with this report.Comments (18)Dr. Rock PositanoHealth Columnist for the New York Daily NewsHealth care providers are seeing an increase in \"walking while texting\" accidents, with terrible injuries undermining the \"viral\" explosion of tragi-comic trips, pratfalls, and collisions.Comments (57)Sheryl Crow and Andrew SharplessImagine you are in the ocean. You hear the lapping of waves, the squeals of dolphins, and the swish of swimming schools of fish -- all sounds you expect to hear underwater. But then a boat glides overhead, and the chatter is drowned by a deafening roar.Comments (20)Emily SpitzerExecutive director, National Health Law ProgramIf you pay for your own insurance, or don\u0027t have insurance, or know someone who may be struggling in this area, please read on. It\u0027s time to start paying attention.Comments (31)Jonathan WeilerDirector of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel HillFacts themselves represent the same impediment for conservatives today that political correctness did two decades ago -- as an appalling constraint on the right\u0027s God-given right to unabashed condemnation.Comments (101)Nathaniel FrankAuthor, \u0027Unfriendly Fire: How the Gay Ban Undermines the Military and Weakens America\u0027What\u0027s critical to realize -- lest we believe that Christian doctrine actually compels its adherents to condemn gay people -- is that anti-gay religious sentiment has always been a matter of tone and focus, so a change here is both the best we\u0027re likely to get and possibly all that\u0027s really needed.CommentsmeQuilibriumPersonalized Stress ManagementAs you wrap up another workday, the last thing you may be inclined to do is sit there and think about what happened.

El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOI am constantly cheering against the Patriots. My dislike of the Patriots has grown to such an extent that I am willing to give up on my favorite division and conference as long as it means a Patriots\u0027 defeat.
