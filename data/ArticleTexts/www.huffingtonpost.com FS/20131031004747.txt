{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jon SoltzCo-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranHow is this even a debate? How is it that men and women who served in uniform get smeared as lazy and unmotivated to work, as soon as they need help feeding their families by using food stamps? How is it that they get targeted, when we clearly have the money to give them the aid they\u0027ve earned, and desperately need? It\u0027s way past time to say \"enough\" to these proposals being floated falsely under the flag of \"fiscal responsibility.\" Real fiscal responsibility goes after those who least need help first -- not those who need help the most. This is about priorities, and unfortunately, as a nation, we aren\u0027t really showing any. That has to change.CommentsMohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOBy maintaining an unchanged policy stance, the Federal Reserve delivered on consensus market expectations. The question now is: How long will this sustain the mix of financial conditions that the Fed and investors desire, and is needed to improve job prospects given the extent of Congressional dysfunction?CommentsRod KuckroFormer Editor-In-Chief Of Platts Electric Power PublicationsJust a few years ago, it seemed the nation\u0027s good fortune for having discovered abundant fuel to make electricity and manufacture a host of everyday products might be reversed by a handful of critics. But a recent study from the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) and the University of Texas may be the single most comforting piece of news this year for gas producers, their customers and everyone concerned about emissions and air quality.Comments (5)Ann BrenoffSenior Writer, The Huffington PostThe standing joke in my family is that I love the dog most of all. I don\u0027t actually think that\u0027s true -- at least not all of the time -- but there is certainly something to be said for the dog always being happy to see me and giving me his unconditional love. And so, with much affection and in good humor please, I offer this list of 8 things I tell the dog that I don\u0027t say to my husband.Comments (64)Bill GeorgeProfessor of Management Practice, Harvard Business SchoolThroughout the push for national insurance reform, the president and his Democratic allies in Congress repeatedly overpromised and underdelivered. The Republicans didn\u0027t help the situation, opposing Obamacare long after the U.S. Supreme Court declared it the law of the land.Comments (81)Danielle CadetEditor, Black VoicesOne really important thing black people don\u0027t do that a lot of white people seem to think is necessary: we don\u0027t paint our faces white when we dress up as a white person for Halloween.Comments (1,166)Beth WoolseyWriter, humorist at the Five Kids Is A Lot of Kids blogIt\u0027s time to come clean, parents. All the way out of the candy-stealing closet. It\u0027s time to stand up for ourselves and demand our rights, because you know what? Kids can\u0027t do this trick-or-treat thing without us.CommentsMansur GidfarCommunications Director, Represent.UsWe have a bill that would roll back protections put in place after the financial crisis that was literally written by lobbyists for one of the major players in that same financial crisis.CommentsPaul PolmanCEO, UnileverClimate change is sometimes misunderstood as being about changes in the weather. In reality it is about changes in our very way of life.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThe key to this part of the law is that the word \"insurance\" implies a standard level of coverage that avoids the cost shifting that occurs when an un- or under-insured person gets sick. The individual market is fraught with such plans, and many are inconsistent with the ACA.CommentsSmita Narula and Rev. Jesse JacksonIn May 1968 thousands of people occupied the National Mall and demanded economic justice in the form of fair wages, decent housing, quality health care and education, and access to adequate food. Nearly fifty years later, this dream remains deferred for far too many Americans.CommentsCandace Calloway WhitingMarine mammal biologistOnly 14 percent of people who viewed Blackfish would choose to take their families to SeaWorld, signifying that the time has come to consider alternatives for the intelligent animals that are kept in theme parks for amusement.Comments (17)Ray ChambersUN Special Envoy for Health FinancingWhat a privilege it is to be a kid who can dress up in a scary costume on a late October night and call on friendly neighbors for a handful of candy. This year I hope you\u0027re adding to your children\u0027s Halloween experience by sending them to the streets carrying that iconic orange UNICEF box.CommentsChloe RileyWriter, Pimp to the Mouth BreathersMy total net worth hovers around entering my piled up work expenses for the past three months, divided by bottles of wine drank last week, times bags of food bought for cat.CommentsNoble SmithAuthorRevisiting \"The Hobbit\" is like sifting through the deep piles of loot in a dragon\u0027s hoard: there\u0027s always something new to discover about J.R.R. Tolkien and his classic.Comments (194)Lynne Gold-BikinPartner, Family Law Practice Group at Weber GallagherIf you want to make it 20, or 40, or 60 years, you need to learn the meaning of communicating in a positive way, fighting appropriately, and putting your spouse first.CommentsKatie HurleyChild and Adolescent Psychotherapist, Parenting ExpertThe people behind the Common Core might think that they are ensuring college/career readiness, but what they are really ensuring is a generation of anxious robotic children who can memorize answers but don\u0027t know how to think.Comments (42)Marty KaplanDirector, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolIf you think the widening chasm between the rich and the rest spells trouble for American democracy, have a look at the growing gulf between the information-rich and -poor.CommentsMike LuxCo-Founder, Democracy PartnersWall Street doesn\u0027t want a new director of FHFA. They like things the way they are, and don\u0027t want a new sheriff in town. That is why Republicans are so willing to buck history and tradition, are so willing to stop the first African-American appointee to run FHFA to be confirmed.CommentsAmy ChanRelationship \u0026 lifestyle columnist, founder of www.JustMyType.caA boy is attracted to girls. A man is attracted to women. Now, this has nothing to do with the actual age of a person. I\u0027m referring to maturity, life vision and stage of life.Comments (207)Paul SzepTwo-time Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonistCommentsRep. Earl BlumenauerU.S. Representative from OregonOnly a few days ago they shut down the government in an attempt to prevent anyone from signing up. And yet, today, they are outraged that not enough people are signing up?Comments (195)Cynthia GermanottaLady Gaga\u0027s mother; Co-founder and President, Born This Way FoundationWhile our runners have been stretching, training, and psyching themselves up for this enormous challenge, the team at Born This Way Foundation has been inspired to think more critically about the intersections of mental and physical health.CommentsJordan FreemanMarketing Director, The Huffington PostThe film About Time uses time travel to take us on an emotional journey and pose an important question: How do you make the most of life?CommentsArt LevineContributing Editor, The Washington MonthlyJust because the Tea Party extremists and their right-wing media allies have spewed essentially nothing but lies and distortions since Obamacare was first proposed, still doesn\u0027t mean that the critics are completely wrong about the dangers these changes could pose.Comments (73)GogobotTravelers looking for something authentically creepy should note that a slew of blood-chilling haunts exist right below their feet in the form of the world\u0027s spookiest cemeteries. Plunge into an inspiring mix of history, sculpture and creepy fun.Comments (56)Mike JulianelleBlogger, DadandBuried.com8. Their breathless worrying about video games and social media and twerking and sex and violence and alcohol and concussions and peanut allergies and we\u0027re out of hand sanitizer!Comments (65)Michelle Kelly-IrvingPublic health researcherThe reality is this: in the academic ecosystem, Ph.D. students are the plankton. They are the stuff on which the rest of the system relies for sustenance. Ph.D. students carry out the research that the senior permanent staff oversee but no longer have time to do.Comments (11)Shannon KaiserSpeaker, life coach, travel writer, author of \u0027Find Your Happy\u0027What I learned is that being happy is possible, no matter how dark your days are, that happiness is attainable, especially when you understand what happy people do to get there.Comments (31)The Daily MealTheDailyMeal.comYou do your best to avoid the typical things: no beer before liquor, drinking a cup of coffee so you can sober up efficiently before bed, and staying away from the Red Bull and vodka. Sadly, however, none of these things are actually going to help you out.CommentsMike WeisserMike the Gun GuyNobody denies that guns are dangerous; nobody denies that when a gun gets into the wrong hands, a serious accident may take place.
