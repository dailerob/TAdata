{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Have you ever wondered why it\u0027s become almost a hobby of billionaires to scapegoat our public schools for the widening inequality in our society? The answer is that if the problem is schools, then we don\u0027t have to think about all the other drivers of inequality. And if we can weaken a public institution along the way, so much the better. The fact is that in the late 1990s, when we had full employment, inequality narrowed and people at the bottom made the biggest gains. And we had the same schools; in fact, the test scores and graduation rates were worse back then than the ones we have today. In the 1950s and 1960s, when we had strong unions and near-full employment, our society became more equal. Face it, we could improve our test scores and send everyone to college, but until we address the other sources of inequality, we will just have more frustrated graduates.Read Post | CommentsRich Lesser, 01/27/13President and Chief Executive Officer of The Boston Consulting Group (BCG)In turbulent times, the glass can be seen as half full or half empty.

If anything, the political and social events of the last few years are evidence that no one is ultimately \"in control\" and that every player is each equally frustrated.Read Post | Comments (140)Ann Jones, 01/27/13Journalist, photographer, authorDespite all the experiments in styles of war-making, the American military and its coalition partners have ended up in the same place: stalemate.

Mack, 01/27/13Professor of Law, Harvard UniversityHistory is as much about the present as it is about the past, and it now presents us with an opportunity to make the civil rights movement speak to our own present struggles rather than freezing its legacy like a black-and-white snapshot of the world of 1963.Read Post | CommentsMichael Hogan, 01/27/13Executive Arts and Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post Media GroupNow that we know that \"Downton\" creator Julian Fellowes is fully capable of going \"Game of Thrones\" on us, I have to wonder what else could happen.
