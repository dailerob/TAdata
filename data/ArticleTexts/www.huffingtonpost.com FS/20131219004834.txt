{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Trita Parsi, Bijan Khajehpour and Reza MarashiThe historic interim agreement between the permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany (P5 1) and Iran over its nuclear dispute is not just about enrichment, centrifuges and breakout capabilities. Ultimately, it will help determine who and what will define Iran\u0027s foreign and domestic policies for decades to come. Will it be the security-oriented, confrontational and internally repressive orientation preferred by the Iranian hardliners? Or will the more cooperative, moderate and win-win approach favored by President Hassan Rouhani and the majority of the population take root and prevail?CommentsMohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOInvestors have responded favorably to the outcome of today\u0027s highly-anticipated Federal Reserve policy meeting, and rightly so. Here are four key takeaways that speak to more than this afternoon\u0027s impressive market moves; they also shed light on what may be ahead.CommentsJeana Lee TahnkTech enthusiast, writer for Parenting Magazine, Cool Mom Tech and MashableWhile we\u0027re moving in the right direction when it comes to overall energy efficiency, there\u0027s a lot more we can do to cushion the impact of our ubiquitous tech usage. Here are ways we can continue to positively impact our Earth and ensure that our resources are preserved for many future generations to enjoy.Comments (4)Bob CescaManaging Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowIt\u0027s weird how Republicans seem to love the Democratic parts of the health care law but aren\u0027t so keen on the Republican parts of the law. But I suppose that\u0027s where guys like Hannity come in: to twist and distort reality so that these uncomfortable and irritating truths don\u0027t get injected into his audience\u0027s epistemic bubble.Comments (96)Bill Moyers and Michael WinshipThis grim anniversary of the Newtown, Conn., killings, with 28 dead, reminded us of that moment back in 2000 when Charlton Heston made his defiant boast at the NRA convention that gun control advocates would have to pry his rifle from his \"cold, dead hands.\"Comments (180)Patrice Bendigwww.patricebendig.comThis past week, I witnessed a true Christmas miracle in the early hours of Dec. 12. 2013 come true for a seven-year old little boy, right on 34th Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.CommentsMichelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesLittle boys and girls in Catholic schools all across the world are still being taught that homosexuality is \"intrinsically disordered.\" And Catholic teachers have been removed from jobs simply for exercising their rights as gay Americans. I haven\u0027t heard the pope weigh in or stop it, while many other people are actually fighting the fight for them.Comments (91)Arianna HuffingtonWith the holidays almost here, Cindi Leive, Mika Brzezinski and I have decided that there is no better time to unplug, recharge and renew ourselves in time for the new year. And what better way to do that than by unplugging and disconnecting from all our devices?Comments (32)Dan LyonsMarketing fellow at HubSpot and creator of \u0027The Secret Diary of Steve Jobs\u0027In public, Apple\u0027s rivals in the smartphone market have tried to downplay the technological advances Apple introduced in the iPhone 5s. But it turns out that one breakthrough -- Apple\u0027s speedy, 64-bit A7 microprocessor -- has set off a panic inside its competitors.Comments (13)Anthony D. RomeroExecutive Director of the American Civil Liberties UnionFor his actions, Snowden should be applauded, not vilified. He should be granted full immunity from prosecution. And he should be allowed to resume his life in the United States as a proud American citizen.Comments (197)Claire FallonDeputy Blog Editor, The Huffington PostWho taught me to be confident, brave, and self-sufficient? Alanna the Lioness, Lyra Belacqua, Jo March and many other YA heroines who refused to let gender roles hold them back.CommentsStacie KrajchirAuthor, Founder The See and Sprout ProjectThe reality is, motherhood is, while blissful, downright scary and beyond overwhelming -- especially after 40.CommentsDaphne EviatarSenior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstWhen Col. John Bogdan took the witness stand at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, he\u0027d been called to testify about the strict limits he\u0027s imposed on defense attorneys\u0027 visits with their death penalty clients. The attorneys representing the defendants accused of masterminding the 9/11 terrorist attacks claim his rules make their jobs unreasonably onerous.CommentsJim SleeperLecturer in Political Science, Yale UniversityWhat makes the column still more revealing and sad is that, far from serving up an older but wiser man\u0027s humility, it recycles what Brooks has been saying quite often since even when he was younger and, one might have hoped, less cynical.CommentsKarl GudeCreative process \u0026 visual storytelling instructor at Michigan State University. Former InfoGraphics Director at Newsweek and The Associated Press.\"Sorry, as a magazine editor, I know what it\u0027s like to flip through dozens of shots to find the right one. And, do you know what gets my e-mail gong? \"That shot, her lipstick is smudged. Her shirt is wrinkled.\"Comments (45)BritChick ParisBritish girl living the Parisian life with all its highs and lowsFlick through any magazine, TV station or website this Christmas and the messages are mostly about perfection. How to get the perfect skin, body, clothes, relationship... life. But underlying all of it is that your life isn\u0027t good enough, you\u0027re not good enough.CommentsBenjamin HartHuffington Post Front-Page EditorDo you watch the currently popular prestige drama that everyone\u0027s always talking about? Oh, you\u0027re still catching up. Where are you? Only on season two? Man. Wait til you get to season three. Season three is definitely the best.CommentsMike LuxCo-Founder, Democracy PartnersThe arrogance of people like Jamie Dimon deserves mockery, and the lack of tough accountability coming from the Department of Justice deserve mockery, so that is what we are offering up.CommentsG. Elijah DannPh.D.; Th.D.; Philosophy \u0026 Religion, Simon Fraser University, AuthorWas Hitchens\u0027 incredulity acerbic and coarse? Irreverent and obscene? Depends on your tastes and sensitivities. More importantly, these qualities were imbedded in charm and wit that set up the discussion of religion in a way that awoke our reflective capacities.CommentsEthan NadelmannExecutive Director, Drug Policy AllianceI\u0027m not one to use the term \"tipping point\" lightly, because one can only say you\u0027ve hit it so many times before losing one\u0027s credibility, but I do think we\u0027ve hit the tipping point on marijuana legalization -- for three reasons.CommentsRalph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorAs millions of Americans struggle with inadequate health care, low wages, deteriorating public services and uncertainty about their futures as the wage gap between the wealthy elite and the working poor widens, billions upon billions of taxpayer dollars are pouring into the coffers of the Department of Defense every year.CommentsBernard-Henri LévyFrench philosopher and writerIt is impossible to predict what the situation in Ukraine will be by the time these lines appear. Already certain, however, is that the events of the past month are extraordinary in every respect.CommentsZach WahlsNational marriage equality advocate; Spokesman, Scouts for Equality; Author, \u0027My Two Moms: Lessons of Love, Strength, and What Makes a Family\u0027I\u0027ve been thinking about grace a lot lately. I think you\u0027re supposed to think about grace during the holidays. I\u0027m thinking about it because I\u0027ve had a really rough last two and a half months and grace feels like the hardest thing in the world to find right now.CommentsMichael MooreOscar and Emmy-winning DirectorIt is, to say the least, a huge honor that for me ranks right up there with the Oscar and the Palme d\u0027Or at Cannes. The National Film Registry is a slightly rarefied list of movies in the history of cinema.CommentsNorman SolomonAuthor, \u0027War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death\u0027News media should illuminate conflicts of interest, not embody them. But the owner of the Washington Post is now doing big business with the Central Intelligence Agency, while readers of the newspaper\u0027s CIA coverage are left in the dark.CommentsPhilip RadfordExecutive Director, GreenpeaceMake no mistake: Here in D.C., the secret political contributions from the 1 percent of the 1 percent of the 1 percent are doing as much damage to our environment as anything else.CommentsPamela MeyerFounder and CEO, CalibrateIf North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un had whispered to his uncle, \"Looking forward to seeing you over the holidays\" it would have taken the cake on this year\u0027s Top Ten List... but this year there were even stronger real contenders.CommentsDJ Louie XIVDJIt is its specificity of purpose -- lyrically, sonically and artistically mining what it means to be Beyonce -- that makes BEYONCE such stirring success. The disciplined commitment to following her own muse coupled with her mammoth natural talents mark her as the most important mainstream pop artist working today.CommentsShelley EmlingSenior Editor, HuffPost 50Every year before Christmas, I spend hours stringing popcorn and cranberries with the goal of producing three long strands to drape around our Christmas tree. I do it every single year without fail even though my kids no longer relish the idea of pricked fingers or too-crumbly popcorn. Why do I do it? Because my mother always did it -- and her mother as well.CommentsPhilip N. CohenSociologist at University of MarylandAt this point I think the evidence suggests that Disney favors compositions in which women\u0027s hands are tiny compared to men\u0027s, especially when they are in romantic relationships. How do real men\u0027s and women\u0027s wrist sizes differ?CommentsJohn BeckerManaging Editor, The Bilerico ProjectReally? In a year full of LGBT rights milestones, it\u0027s Pope Francis who\u0027s the \"person of the year,\" simply for pulling slightly back from Benedict\u0027s bigotry? We\u0027re handing out accolades because someone makes us feel hopey-changey?CommentsDan GlickmanSenior Fellow at the Bipartisan Policy CenterIn these days of record-breaking-spending legislators and aspiring politicians, regardless of party, pursue campaign dollars from high-income donors as a matter of simple political survival. They follow the advice of Willie Sutton who, when asked why he robbed banks said, \"that\u0027s where the money is.\"CommentsChristina Wilkes, 2013.18.12Fredda Wasserman, 2013.18.12Vicki Cobb, 2013.18.12Rob Kutner, 2013.18.12Jason Sattler, 2013.18.12Charles J.
