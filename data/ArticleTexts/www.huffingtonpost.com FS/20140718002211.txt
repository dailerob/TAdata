Today, right now, I want us to take back our power, and begin to mend together what has been ripped apart. It is too late to bring back the innocent lives that have been lost so far in the Middle East, but it is not too late to stop the killing that is happening now. It is too late to bring back the innocent plane passengers who died in Ukraine, but as a human race we can insist that this is unacceptable and not let the incident be a springboard for even more violence and hatred.

They have had about them an aura of puerility, of \"good guys\" versus \"bad guys,\" that will leave future historians stunned.Author, \u0027Beyond the Green Zone: Dispatches from an Unembedded Journalist in Occupied IraqObesity is among the most pressing public health concerns today -- and the situation has just taken a turn for the worse.Public Health Editor, The Huffington Post; Former U.S. Assistant Surgeon GeneralI\u0027d love to tell my daughter that I have always loved my body.

Here\u0027s what you need to know about \"organic,\" \"local\" and \"natural\" food labels.Writer and editor exploring food politics, food culture and Millennials at EveTurow.comIsrael must take the initiative because its extraordinary achievements and permanence cannot be sustained by its military prowess alone, but rather by its dedication to the moral values for the lack of which millions of Jews have suffered and perished.Senior Fellow, NYU\u0027s Center for Global AffairsMore than three years after peaceful protests were met with deadly force by security forces and the situation devolved into a civil war, the suffering of Syrians across the political spectrum has been prolonged because politics trumped peace and security, impunity prevailed over justice, and a system of international governance and its leadership failed.Executive Director, Physicians for Human Rights (PHR)Anyone who has parented a human for more than five minutes has felt the coils of the day wrapping around their insides, making the chest tight and the stomach hungry for nachos.WriterIt is a cliché that your true friends are those who support you through troubled times. Similarly, a measure of friendship is the willingness to invest in the relationship -- investing time, effort, and emotion.Statistician and health economist for the United Nations; Teacher, Columbia UniversitySo much in American life these days doesn\u0027t work. But soccer does work -- magnificently.

I do not know why they took this tack, but the result was to focus media and public attention on the for-profit sector specifically.Executive Director of California Competes and former Deputy Under Secretary at the U.S. Department of EducationRepublicans have been saying that the \"war on women\" Democrats accuse them of waging is a fake issue. Really? If it\u0027s not a war, it\u0027s one hell of a frontal assault. We\u0027ll see if women remember in November.Money Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsFormer Vice President Dick Cheney is trying hard to salvage his legacy, so he is resorting to spin, distortion and lies.

The Iraq War or the Iraq-Syrian War would be far too orderly for what\u0027s happening, so it remains a no-name conflict that couldn\u0027t be deadlier or more destabilizing -- and it\u0027s in the process of internationalizing in unsettling ways.Editor, TomDispatch.comThere Clare stood at the shoreline, her 8-year-old arms crossed in front of her, a scowl on her face, her feet dug in as I tried to tempt her into the waves with a brand-new boogie board.
