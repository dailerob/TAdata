{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"New Year\u0027s weekend is the perfect opportunity to clean out our internal hard drives, and begin to bring more balance to our lives (I don\u0027t know anyone who doesn\u0027t need more balance, so will someone please go ahead and create an app for that already?!). How about beginning with a list of three things you thought you would do one day but, realistically, you never will. You can just declare them complete. For example, I always wanted to learn German and be able to read many of my favorite authors in the original. But the truth is, I\u0027m never going to. So I\u0027ve declared learning German complete and crossed it off my list. By deleting things from your mind that you will one day, some day do, you\u0027re freeing up space to devote yourself to projects you are truly committed to. So what are you going to cross off your list to make room for all your New Year\u0027s resolutions as 2011 kicks into gear?Read Post | CommentsGary Hart, 12.27.2010Scholar in Residence at the University of ColoradoEvery man for himself would be a rational approach if men and women were merely economic creatures.
