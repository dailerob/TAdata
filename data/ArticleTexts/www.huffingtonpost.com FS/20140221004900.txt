{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Robert L. BorosagePresident, Institute for America\u0027s FutureThe Obama administration continues to push a fast track to nowhere. U.S. Trade Representative Michael B. Froman now has launched charm offensive, meeting with legislators, consumer, union and environmental groups to try to defuse growing opposition to fast track trade authority. Fat chance. Senate Majority leader Harry Reid says he has no intention of bringing fast track up on the Senate floor (at least before the election). House Speaker John Boehner couldn\u0027t even round up a Democratic co-sponsor for the bill. Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi has voiced her opposition. The inescapable reality is that the U.S. has pursued a globalization strategy that is a calamitous failure. This isn\u0027t the time to pursue more, better, bigger trade accords. This is a time for a fundamental reassessment.Comments (14)Charles BestFounder, DonorsChoose.orgThink of it as \"satisfaction guaranteed AND your money back.\" I think it\u0027s pretty cool that Arianna is donating profits from her book so that her readers can experience the joy of giving.CommentsRobert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, Beyond OutrageThe winners here are truly big winners. WhatsApp\u0027s fifty-five employees are now enormously rich. Its two founders are now billionaires. And the partners of the venture capital firm that financed it have also reaped a fortune. And the rest of us?Comments (32)David Katz, M.D.Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterA new study of mammography, showing lack of survival benefit, has once again muddied these waters and muddled the relevant messaging.CommentsShelley EmlingSenior Editor, HuffPost 50Thanks to Facebook, the idea of \u0027de-friending\u0027 someone is not a foreign one. With a few simple clicks, you can wipe someone from your \u0027friends\u0027 list and never again be faced with a seemingly endless stream of birthday party photos from someone you\u0027re no longer close to. But in the real world it\u0027s a lot harder to \u0027de-friend\u0027 someone -- but it can be even more important to do so.Comments (11)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundWe are making progress: student achievement is up, dropout rates are down and achievement gaps between racial groups are narrowing. But these improvements are not big enough, widespread enough or fast enough for us to be content.CommentsEmma KellyFounder and Editor of Ginger Parrot (www.gingerparrot.co.uk), a website for redheadsHaving pale skin may mean that redheads burn more easily when exposed to UV rays, but their paleness can serve as an advantage. Redheads can\u0027t absorb sufficient Vitamin D due to low concentrations of eumelanin in their body.Comments (150)Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoHow should the University of Mississippi respond? What does it mean to say that these \"ideas have no place here\"? Assuming the individuals who did this were students, should the university expel or otherwise discipline them? Are there \"ideas\" that \"have no place\" on a university campus?Comments (51)Bianca BoskerExecutive Tech Editor, The Huffington PostWe\u0027ve thought of Facebook\u0027s growing ecosystem of services as revolving around and expanding the core Facebook experience. We\u0027re thinking too small. Zuckerberg is dreaming of an even larger universe of services that aren\u0027t tied to Facebooking, but communicating -- full stop.Comments (12)Carina KolodnySr. Editor for Special Projects, The Huffington PostI believe that marriage equality will stomp out the remaining misogyny that you call \"tradition.\" And that\u0027s a win, not just for the LGBTQ community but for heterosexual women and the heterosexual men that see them as equals.Comments (90)Dan KovalikHuman and labor rights lawyerThe U.S. media, echoing the sentiments of the U.S. government, is openly encouraging violent regime change in Venezuela. This type of reporting is not only irresponsible, but it is deeply misinformed.CommentsKevin KniffinBehavioral scientist at Cornell UniversityIf your favorite team or player wins on a given day -- especially if it\u0027s a landslide win, then it\u0027s likely that \"momentum\" gets thrown around by people previewing the next event. For better or worse, momentum is one of those concepts that\u0027s sticky in our heads.CommentsTom EngelhardtEditor, TomDispatch.comIntelligence officials have weighed in with an estimate of just how many secret files National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden took with him when he headed for Hong Kong last June. Brace yourself: 1.7 million.Comments (12)Matt WalshBlogger, talk radio host, father of twinsThere are two types of criticisms -- constructive and destructive. Your success in life will rely on your ability to ignore the second type and listen to the first.CommentsDaniel SolomonWriter and consultant based in Washington, DCThe glacial decay of the Ukrainian public sphere, as a political thing, is a years-long, intentional affair. In the decade since the so-called Orange Revolution in 2004, Ukraine\u0027s governing patrons have engaged an aggressive campaign of civic subterfuge.CommentsUnveiling Afghanistan“The Unheard Voices of Progress” is a campaign by openasia.org and fidh.orgI was held in solitary confinement for 18 months in 1978 without a trial because of my political activities. I was subjected to torture during investigations by the intelligence service and then transferred to Pul-e Charkhi prison.CommentsTavis SmileyPBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorThe R\u0026B duo joins me tonight on PBS to discuss their long history together, maintaining relevancy in the music industry and the inspiration behind the new album.CommentsTinatin JaparidzeArtist, ComposerAre the United States and the European Union right to impose sanctions on Ukrainian officials as a result of the escalating violence in Kiev? If so, should they be more proactive in solving the Ukrainian crisis?CommentsRep. Alan GraysonU.S. Congressman for Florida\u0027s 9th DistrictThere were no U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan last month. For the first time in over two years. I\u0027m happy that, conceivably, we may finally be seeing that secret war come to a quiet end.CommentsDennis Van RoekelPresident of the National Education AssociationNEA members have a right to feel frustrated, upset, and angry about the poor commitment to implementing the standards correctly. So, where do we go from here?CommentsThe Motley FoolTo Educate, Amuse \u0026 EnrichPeople usually get better at things over time. We\u0027re better farmers, faster runners, safer pilots, and more accurate weather forecasters than we were 50 years ago. But there\u0027s something about money that gets the better of us.CommentsJohn FefferCo-director, Foreign Policy In FocusToday we confront the fallen world of Syria. Is this House of Cards territory where ambition and revenge battle for supremacy and there is nothing to do but watch the horrors unfold before our eyes? Or do we believe that, despite our own original sins, we Americans can don the white hat and fix things in Syria?CommentsXimena VengoecheaProduct Operations Manager at LinkedInWhen I began my journaling journey, I decided to close my laptop and go it by hand. And that month I discovered a funny, simple thing: writing -- by hand -- makes me a better writer. And reading -- on paper -- that makes me a better reader, too.CommentsDana PointsEditor in Chief of Parents and American Baby and Content Director for the Meredith Parents NetworkSleep. It\u0027s the thing new moms crave more than a long, hot shower. Certainly more than they crave sex. But a good night\u0027s sleep is elusive when there\u0027s a baby in the house.CommentsAdam GrantWharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027I\u0027ve noticed that despite growing social and professional acceptance, introverts are still wildly misunderstood. People may be more open about being introverts, but they cling to assumptions that don\u0027t stand up to the test of rigorous evidence. It\u0027s time to debunk five myths.Comments (35)Seth ShostakSenior Astronomer, SETI InstituteFor four hundred years, the relationship between astronomers and their telescopes has been as fundamental as that between a psychiatrist and his couch. But once the LSST starts digitizing the sky, it will alter the paradigm dramatically.CommentsAdam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911Here are five things you can do to protect your good financial name in the event that stars, once aligned, go spinning off into the cold universe, and you find yourself thrust from loving cohabitation into relational isolation.CommentsNorman SolomonAuthor, \u0027War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death\u0027Few people have direct contact with outfits like Booz Allen Hamilton or Lockheed Martin. But every day, Amazon is depending on millions of customers to go online and buy products from its sites. As more people learn about its CIA ties, Amazon could -- and should -- suffer the consequences.CommentsRalph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorBoth sides of the aisle are spinning the report, creating a fog around minimum wage policy that may further discourage a Walmart-influenced Congress from taking any action. Given the miserly state of the minimum wage today, such a can\u0027t-do attitude is unacceptable.Comments (36)Ashley HardawayFreelance food and travel writer.
