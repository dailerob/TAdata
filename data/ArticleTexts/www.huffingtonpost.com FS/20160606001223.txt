{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week the nation looked on, horrified, as a silverback gorilla threatened a captive who looked unable to escape. I\u0027m talking, of course, about Donald Trump, who is turning out to be every bit as dangerous and unstable as predicted. After he continued to attack the judge in the Trump University lawsuit, the judge unsealed documents showing how staffers were encouraged to prey on the vulnerable. \"It was really a fraud,\" said New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, \"from beginning to end.\" And in that way, a true reflection of its namesake. But perhaps it sealed the deal for Speaker Paul Ryan, who, after hesitating, endorsed Trump, showing his principles to be worth as much as a Trump U real estate class. Rising to the occasion were Michigan Governor Rick Snyder, who declined to endorse Trump, and former CIA and NSA chief Michael Hayden, who described Trump\u0027s rhetoric as \"feeding\" ISIS\u0027s recruitment videos. And you don\u0027t have to be a genius to see Trump for who he is, but it doesn\u0027t hurt. He\u0027s \"a demagogue who seems to appeal to the lowest common denominator,\" said Stephen Hawking. Nothing theoretical about that.Ali spoke softly and moved deliberately, but nonetheless had an unmistakeable twinkle in his eye. In those years before his illness completely muted him, Ali had solved the issue of how to manage the outpouring of adulation that accompanied his most casual appearances by deflecting. \"No,\" he said, \"You\u0027re the greatest.\" In his face was a genuine warmth and sweetness.ActorTrump hasn\u0027t been running against the establishment. He\u0027s not even running against Hillary Clinton. He\u0027s running against the Constitution. And that means one thing. He\u0027s running against the one thing that has always made America great.Fmr. United States Ambassador, Special Counsel to the President, and President of the State Bar of CaliforniaIt would be hard to imagine a life more majestic, fulfilled, and life-affirming than his. May Muhammad Ali rest in the very peace he sought to increase. If ever there were a time for a state funeral, it\u0027s now.Award-winning filmmaker, public thinker, and authorWe fiddle, and the republic burns. It\u0027s sickening. Donald Trump, man-child arsonist, is day by day torching the most sacred American values -- threatening the welfare of millions, undermining the pillars of our democracy, igniting the ugliest impulses of the society\u0027s id -- and we, the media, are covering it like a bemused recap of House of Cards.Editor-at-large for MediaPost; Co-host of public radio\u0027s Peabody Award-winning \"On the Media\"Today we bow our heads at the loss of a man who did so much for America. Tomorrow we will raise our heads again remembering that his bravery, his outspokenness, and his sacrifice for the sake of his community and country lives on in the best part of each of us.NBA Legend, Pop Culture columnistVoters are fed up with runaway inequality and the policies which foster it. The super-rich have created a rigged economic system. We are being financially strip-mined by economic elites.Author, \"Runaway Inequality: An Activist\u0027s Guide to Economic Justice\"How many women die preventable deaths each year? When I first started working on global health and development issues a decade and a half ago, the answer shocked me: \"No one knows.\"Co-chair, the Bill and Melinda Gates FoundationThe commitment of many businesses to lead the transition to a low carbon economy is already yielding results.CEO, UnileverFor I don\u0027t know how long, Muhammad Ali had been no more than an inch behind me and only me, rubbing his fingers by my ear making an insect sound. Then he put up his dukes.Novelist, Screenwriter, and Associate Professor at Columbia UniversityIt takes nothing away from Senator Sanders, and the millions of voters he has mobilized, to observe that deeper currents are at work that have created a political climate which has sharply influenced both him and Secretary Clinton.President of the Democracy AllianceNothing in Ali\u0027s monumental life was given to him. He earned it all. He earned his titles. He earned our respect. Now, like butterflies and bees that have soared in the heat of the day, he has earned his rest.Award-Winning Author of Freestyle: Reflections on Faith, Family, Justice, and Pop Culture; Founding Pastor of Joy Tabernacle A.M.E. Church in Dallas, TexasI had the great privilege of joining Arianna Huffington, HuffPost\u0027s editor-in-chief, at the 2016 Commencement Ceremony of my alma mater, Hunter College. Arianna gave the keynote address and was given the President\u0027s Medal by Hunter College President, Jennifer Raab.Huffington Post video producer and host of \"Talk Nerdy To Me\"In a new scholarly article, law professors Robin Kar and Jason Mazzone have taken a deep dive into the history of Supreme Court nominations to test the plausibility of the Senate Republicans\u0027 purported \"justification\" for their action.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoWith a busy career as an actress on \"Orange Is the New Black,\" my life sometimes feels more out of control than ever. At the same time, I know that the opposite is also true: That I am the captain of my ship; I am the master of my fate. And I would never have known that if it were not for my hair.Actress, writer and entrepreneur from New York, NYThere is only one organizing principle which makes sense of his wildly oscillating utterances and behavior -- the clinical definition of narcissistic personality disorder.Novelist and contributing opinion writerIt is a horrible situation, but even more upsetting to me is the public backlash that has taken place since the incident happened. It\u0027s not an issue about whether or not we value the life of an animal or human more; it\u0027s about doing what is so obviously right in an impossibly difficult situation.Program Assistant at iCan HouseAli, who died Friday at 74, is regarded as one of the greatest boxers in history, even though his career was interrupted for more than three years. At his peak, powerful figures in government, media, and sports inflicted great hardship on the boxer-turned-activist for following his religious and political convictions.E.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeJust as Lord of the Flies is not about Jack, this year\u0027s campaign is not about Donald Trump. The grown-up Republican primary voters who have made Trump their presumptive nominee, have yielded to the same primitive temptations as the boys of the book.Author of \u0027Sally Ride: America\u0027s First Woman in Space\u0027 and an award-winning broadcaster and authorSet aside the fact that Judge Curiel\u0027s position on US-Mexican relations, whatever they might be, has no bearing on the merits of the Trump University case he presides over. Instead, we should focus on the lack of any evidence offered by Trump to sustain his underlying allegation of judicial prejudice.Author, \u0027Dangerous Ground\u0027In the past year, we have seen a welcome surge, prodded by new books on slavery, campus debates, and student protests, of new commitments by some universities and other institutions to confront the truth about their own histories, especially the ugly legacies of slavery and Native American genocide.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundOur president just got back from Hiroshima, Japan, the site where we dropped the big one -- the only country to use it... so far. It struck up an important conversation with my kids.Founding member of The DoorsIf we want to attain the greatness for which humanity is once again eligible, we must keep faith in its possibility. We must do all we can to realize it. We must broaden and share more widely the benefits of progress. And we must help one another to cope with the shocks that none of us will see coming.Director of the Oxford Martin School at Oxford University; Co-author, \"Age of Discovery: Navigating the Risks and Rewards of Our New Renaissance\"Co-author, \"Age of Discovery: Navigating the Risks and Rewards of Our New Renaissance\"The Sanders campaign must do more than simply remind Hillary of what needs to change; it must bear genuine political pressure on the system to make sure the changes occur. And the most powerful way to do that is for Bernie to win big in California on June 7th.AuthorOf all the accomplishments and disappointments of the Obama presidency, his nuclear weapons policy is the greatest. Yes, you read that correctly. Obama\u0027s approach to nukes will be his most significant legacy as well as his most salient failure.Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogMy choice is tempered with self-understanding and a healthy dose of self-love. The tale of my mane is a love story. It is a radical and political declaration of the love I have for myself. It\u0027s a sisterhood within me. My hair has history.Writer, Speaker, Creator, Blogger, Carefree Black Girl, unapologetic weirdo and aspiring cat lady.Prince was known as an advocate for clean living, and if fear of being stigmatized as a drug addict was a contributing factor to his untimely death, just like it is for many others, serious consideration needs to include an end to the stigma around drug use.Program Associate at the Drug Policy AllianceI\u0027m officially in my 40s. I\u0027m surrounded by teenagers. And I\u0027m tired of fetuses on the internet telling me what to do. Some woman-child who thinks she\u0027s all grown up is going to tell me what I can\u0027t wear anymore because I\u0027m too old? Seriously. F*ck that noise.Writer, blogger and advocateI was shocked and profoundly saddened by the painful ridicule of developmentally and intellectually challenged individuals featured in the Showtime Network comedy special, Gary Owen: I Agree With Myself.I\u0027ve had it. Please, and I mean this from the bottom of my overly exhausted heart, take your scientific pie chart and shove it.Sarah Kallies is a writer, speaker, musician, wife and mother. She is a a mental illness fighter, recovering addict, and assault survivor.I can\u0027t say it enough - Donald Trump holds veterans in such low regard, and targets us for his scams so much because he has absolutely no respect for what we have sacrificed.
