{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"LONDON - I am delighted to be in London today for the first Huffington Post launch outside of North America: Welcome to HuffPost UK. Britain has always held a very special place in my heart, having gone to college and started my career here. Indeed, my time in the UK set the course for the rest of my life -- leading all the way, in fact, to the creation of The Huffington Post in May of 2005. We are arriving here in the midst of a rich and thriving media culture marked by great innovation. We look forward to adding HuffPost UK to the mix, and to our real-time \u0027digital water cooler\u0027 -- which embraces the best of the new (immediacy, transparency, interactivity) and the best of the old (fact-checking, accuracy, fairness, and an emphasis on storytelling) -- becoming the spark for many interesting conversations. So check out HuffPost UK and let us know what you think.Read Post | CommentsDean Baker, 07.05.2011Co-Director of the Center for Economic and Policy ResearchThere is nothing wrong with using general revenue for Social Security, however, several Republicans have already indicated that they intend to use the revenue shortfall as an argument for cutting benefits.Read Post | CommentsTracey Ullman, 07.04.2011Actress, comedianArianna, I know you say you feel at home here in the UK, having gone to Cambridge and dated Bernard Levin and all, but if you think you get flack in the USA at times, it\u0027s nothing to what the Brits will hurl at you.Read Post | CommentsChristina Patterson, 07.05.2011Writer and Columnist for The IndependentThe story took the usual course.

While strangely flattering for the NGO or civil society activist, this is not the whole story.Read Post | CommentsMarcus Samuelsson, 07.05.2011Chef; Author, \"New American Table\"Salad can get a bad rap.
