{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"You can feel the resignation settling into the establishment -- a sense that 8 or 9 percent unemployment is a natural condition like the weather, something that just happens to us and which we can\u0027t do anything about. But, in reality, this level of unemployment isn\u0027t just happening. Decisions are being made on a regular basis that are prolonging the economic crisis. And there are plenty of steps we can take that would produce tangible positive results in the lives of millions of people. The problem is that we have a broken system in which even good, sensible ideas never make it to market. They get proposed, they get support in policy circles, they even get introduced in Congress. And then... they die. A perfect example of a sensible idea that has nevertheless gone nowhere is Right-to-Rent, which would allow foreclosed on homeowners to stay in their homes as renters, paying a fair market rate determined by an independent appraiser.Read Post | Comments (374)Dylan Ratigan, 11/9/11Host, MSNBC\u0027s \u0027The Dylan Ratigan Show\u0027; Author, soon to be released \u0027Greedy Bastards\u0027It\u0027s time for our leaders to be honest about actually addressing the problem of gross overleveraging in finance, because the Eurozone mess isn\u0027t going away.Read Post | Comments (106)Deb Bushway, 11.08.2011Interim President, Capella UniversityAs we address issues of American competitiveness, we need to widen our lens and think differently about the education of the American workforce -- particularly of non-traditional students, like working adults.Read Post | Comments (8)Sec. Hilda Solis, 11/9/11U.S. Secretary of LaborOhio has made it clear: these dedicated public servants still need a seat at the table to demand fairness, dignity and respect -- especially in tough economic times.
