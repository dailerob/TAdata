{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Syndicated Columnist and Longtime Political StrategistThe fact that Trump and Carson have led the Republican pack for as long as they have says more about their inept opponents and the increasingly radical GOP base than it does about their own abilities as candidates. But, should the Republican Party choose to nominate a more mainstream conservative it will not be dodging a bullet for long. That is because the so-called serious alternatives to Trump and Carson have serious problems of their own that Democrats will surely exploit in a general election that will not be dominated by a bunch of Sanka-sipping, Fox News-watching, doomsday-prepping, old white men. In order to win over an increasingly diverse America, the eventual Republican nominee will have to do more than simply be less crazy than the next guy.We know that more than 90 percent of Americans support common-sense reforms that are proven to save lives.

President, Writers Guild of America, East.Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyThe Party of Putin does not know, or pretend not to know, that Putin is an empire builder surrounded by ideologues whose vision of the world, though complex and robust, is in all key respects opposed to that of the West.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.Republicans must thoughtfully engage with Black Lives Matter if they desire to gain African American votes from the Democrats. Empty rhetoric will not suffice, and the silence of the GOP on issues that disproportionately impact African Americans cannot continue unabated without dire consequences for the future of the GOP.Masters of Divinity candidate at Westminster Theological Seminary in PhiladelphiaWe\u0027re told to fake it till we make it. Nonsense. I can\u0027t believe how many people tell me how well their company is doing, and three months later it\u0027s out of business. If only they had shared their challenges, maybe I or someone in their network could have helped.I like to make stuff on computers. CEO of Highrise and maker of Draft.Mudslinging is no new phenomenon in modern presidential elections. But for the first time ever, it\u0027s juxtaposed with a new style of campaigning: Bernie Sanders\u0027 style.Technology Analyst at R/GAWe of course can\u0027t be satisfied just growing OGP and growing the model. We\u0027ve got to keep this organization fluid and vibrant and responsive to what citizens are asking for around the world.U.S. Permanent Representative to the United NationsMost people mistake their own perspective, shaped by their subjective and limited perception, for the absolute reality of the external world. Questioning this assumption is what advanced our research on dark matter. It is also the only thing that has ever advanced human empathy.Physics Professor, Harvard University; Author, \u0027Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs: The Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe\u0027It is getting better, but it might not be good enough for any given individual just yet. The optimism of children and adolescents is understandable, but even when you find community on the internet you cannot simply assume that your parents and peers will support you.Executive Director, Gender Rights MarylandThe NRA has promoted insurrectionism to the point that it has become the foundational belief of the modern pro-gun movement, with even \"sensible\" high-profile Republicans like presidential candidate Marco Rubio advocating its tenets.Executive Director, Coalition to Stop Gun ViolenceWe ought not to be blinded by media theater, or by habits of dismissing the doubts, and even the deaths, of countless people just like ourselves, overseas, whenever our government offers us its unsubstantiated explanations, its sincere good will, its apologies.Co-coordinator, Voices for Creative NonviolenceWhat reportedly happened in that Spring Valley classroom is a prime example of the consequences of having a routine police presence in schools.Advocacy and Policy Strategist, ACLUThere is a difference between being inspired by an indigenous culture and appropriating it, especially while that culture is very much alive; which brings me to the endless stream of Pocahotties and headdresses seen at almost every Halloween party or street parade.Native American/British, Feminist, IS/Transgender AdvocateShouldn\u0027t there be places in the world where cellphones, tablets and other high-tech pieces of modern communications are off-limits and their use curtailed to emergencies only?Independent source of news and analysis, from the academic and research community.Both leaders were engaged in empty rhetoric and slogans for domestic consumption instead of proposing new, credible and constructive initiatives to resume the negotiations that could lead to a peace agreement, which should have been the thrust of their appearances at the UNGA. That, however, was not -- and still is not -- the case.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUWhat father raising his male child without a mother would feel like he\u0027d succeeded in raising him the way his mother would have wanted, if he grew up to believe he was somehow superior to the opposite sex?Author of Sunday Times Bestseller \u0027It\u0027s Not Raining, Daddy, It\u0027s Happy\u0027 and writer of the award-winning blog \u0027Life as a Widower\u0027A total of 854 people have already been executed in the Islamic Republic in the first 10 months of 2015, according to the Iran Human Rights Documentation Center (IHRDC), which records \"unofficial,\" \"semiofficial\" and \"official\" executions.Vocativ - news sourced from the deep web.\"How come your arms are all wrinkled up?\" the little girl asks. I\u0027ve got ichthyosis. It makes my skin look overly dry, scaly and cracked, darker than normal. Much like a snake\u0027s skin, but I suppose \u0027wrinkled\u0027 describes it too.Psychotherapist and a woman with special needsThis week, FBI Director James B. Comey became the latest public figure to claim that national scrutiny of police has contributed to a \"spike\" in violent crime in America. This nefarious theory, dubbed the \"Ferguson Effect\" has become a regular talking point on conservative media.Policy Analyst \u0026 Data Scientist with Campaign Zero.The hearing ensued in confusion, as the attorneys and judge argued over what the law is, who\u0027s required to explain it to the defendant and how bin Attash can inform the judge why he wants a new lawyer. Underlying the entire discussion was a sense that no one in the room knows all the relevant facts.Senior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstYou keep telling people you\u0027re innocent. All you get in reply is, \"Yeah, we hear that a lot.\" At that moment, each assumed he or she would be found innocent, because a guilty verdict was just too ridiculous to fathom. It would be the stuff of horror movies. Fiction. Then the jury foreman said, \"Guilty.\"JournalistDoes Dr. Carson really believe he is the father of some retro revolution in which men regain control of women, making us see the error of our waywardness? Women are so far past that that it\u0027s a joke, which is why abortion should not even be in question. Wake up, Dr. Carson.Actress and authorThe number of school-related arrests is often linked to the proliferation of \"zero-tolerance\" policies in education. Zero-tolerance policies represent those that strike immediate consequences for any kind of misbehavior by students, regardless of the circumstances.Activist, Freelance Writer and Child Welfare AdvocateThere are no do-overs or reboots, and our primary job as parents is to lay a solid foundation for our children\u0027s future. I want more for my son. I expect more of my son -- and so should his school. My kids are not an experiment for a foundering system.Deputy director of audience engagement, Los Angeles TimesAbuse is killing the social web. And hence, it isn\u0027t peripheral to Internet business models -- it\u0027s central. Twitter could have been a town square. But now it\u0027s more like a drunken, heaving mosh pit. We dreamed that we created a revolution.
