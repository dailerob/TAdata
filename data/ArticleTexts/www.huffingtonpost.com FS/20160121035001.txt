{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027Why did the white working class abandon the Democrats? The conventional answer is Republicans skillfully played the race card. In the wake of the Civil Rights Act, segregationists led southern whites out of the Democratic Party. Later, Republicans charged Democrats with coddling black \"welfare queens,\" being soft on black crime, and trying to give jobs to less-qualified blacks over more-qualified whites. The bigotry now spewing forth from Donald Trump and several of his Republican rivals is an extension of this old race card, now applied to Mexicans and Muslims -- with much the same effect on the white working class voters, who don\u0027t trust Democrats to be as \"tough.\" All true, but this isn\u0027t the whole story. Democrats also abandoned the white working class.On January 20, 2017, America will begin our next chapter. A new president will stand on the steps of the Capitol, raise one hand, and take the oath of office. From that moment on, he or she will decide whether we defend and build on the progress we\u0027ve made under President Obama -- or tear it all away.Democratic candidate for President; Former Secretary of State, U. S. Senator and First LadyLook at how pharmaceutical companies actually spend their money. Contrary to what they claim, research does not dominate.

What role should the government play in caring for our veterans?ABC News correspondent and co-founder of the Bob Woodruff FoundationI blame John McCain more than anyone else for the fact that Donald Trump is the clear frontrunner of the Republican pack right now.

Here are 10 steps for what to do in case of a raid.Policy Director for Mijente and the #Not1More CampaignWe assume that low achievement indicates a poor school when, in fact, it is merely proof of a neglected community.

That is where former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin comes in.Hofstra Journalism ProfessorSen. Cruz\u0027s Expatriate Terrorist Act would allow bureaucrats to strip citizenship from U.S. citizens on the dangerously vague grounds of \"assistance\" to a terrorist group.

I hope you will lend us a hand that day as tears are already falling down my face picturing that bittersweet dance.Nurse, writer, travellerThe U.S. has never exported much crude oil -- but that is likely about to change because congressional leaders recently lifted the country\u0027s 40-year-old ban on crude oil exports. However, this new expected surge of crude oil exports will be entering a market that is clouded by too little transparency. Better data is needed urgently in order to evaluate and quantify the oil sector\u0027s climate responsibilities.Director, Carnegie’s Energy and Climate Program; ex-Chevron chemical engineerWhile it\u0027s more than fair to tear into Ted Cruz and Donald Trump for denying basic science, it\u0027s impossible to win the fight for the climate by simply lambasting the right.Truman National Security Fellow, Public Policy Consultant, Meditation TeacherGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
