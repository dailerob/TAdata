{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressNew York Times columnist Thomas Friedman has returned from another of his periodic sojourns into the cloudcuckooland of his own imagination, and brings us word of this dream he had, which he hopes to implant. The basic plot is this: In an alternate universe, our American lawmakers buck their traditional bases to come up with a plan -- it\u0027s a revision of an old plan, actually -- that singlehandedly eliminates the need for the Sad Guys On Trading Floors blog forever.Read Post | CommentsDr. Peggy Drexler, 8/10/11Author, \u0027Our Fathers Ourselves. Daughters, Fathers, And The Changing American Family\u0027To all those Republicans lamenting the Bachmann imagery, I have to say: \"Wait a minute. You started this.\" When Sarah Palin strode on the convention nominating stage with her tight skirt and traditional values, the fellas on the right said \"We\u0027re on to something here.\"Read Post | CommentsRobert Creamer, 8/10/11Political organizer, strategist and authorEven though they fell short of achieving the end goal, progressives in Wisconsin did take considerable political ground in the ongoing war over the future direction of American politics -- and the fate of the middle class.Read Post | CommentsJoseph A. Palermo, 8/10/11Associate Professor of American History, California State University, SacramentoIt\u0027s strange that President Obama doesn\u0027t show any indignation about our long slide into economic oblivion. He\u0027s certainly not \"fighting mad\" about it. He draws a line in the sand, the Republicans cross it, then he steps back and draws another line in the sand.Read Post | CommentsToni Nagy, 8/10/11tonibologna.comGoing home with someone who bought you a beer is hardly worth letting them inside your body. By being a little prude, you are helping the male species remember that being inside a woman\u0027s body is actually a really big deal.Read Post | CommentsRobert Walker, 8/10/11Executive Vice President, Population InstituteWe saw what happens when over-leveraged economies like the U.S. and Europe failed to anticipate the threats posed by unsustainable debt loads; we don\u0027t want to see what happens if we ignore signs that we are over-leveraging the planet\u0027s resources.Read Post | CommentsJayshree Bajoria, 8/10/11Senior Staff Writer, Council on Foreign RelationsWe need to learn from this crisis that there are many factors that contributed to it. One is conflict. And conflict resolution should be essential.Read Post | CommentsRodney Green, 8/10/11Director of Golf, Innisbrook Resort and Golf ClubLet\u0027s face it. Golf is not the same without Tiger. The young guns that have burst upon the scene have played admirably, but none of them have come close to showing the dominance or consistency that Tiger had when he was on his game.Read Post | CommentsLawrence Lessig, 8/10/11Professor of Law, Harvard Law SchoolAs many of us believe that our nation has come to another moment of crisis in its capacity to govern, some of us believe we must begin to talk through whether fundamental reform through a convention will be required.Read Post | CommentsArianna Huffington, 8/9/11Our politicians have chosen to narrow their imaginations, but they can\u0027t narrow ours. Even if we can\u0027t control how Washington responds to our problems, we still have control over how we respond to them.Read Post | CommentsChristine Bronstein, 8/10/11Founder, A Band of WivesAs I dip my toe back into the entrepreneurial world I see a very different landscape, a landscape that helps me keep my faith in the global economy. Here\u0027s what I see: Women can save the day.Read Post | CommentsRobert Reich, 8/10/11Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Aftershock\u0027President Obama is being badly advised. The magnitude of the current jobs and growth crisis demands a boldness and urgency that\u0027s utterly lacking.Read Post | CommentsBrent Budowsky, 8/10/11ColumnistLet\u0027s begin a draft movement to make Al Gore president in 2016. While times are tough today, let\u0027s stop selling short our aspirations and start planning for the next New Frontier.Read Post | CommentsDawn Teo, 8/10/11Arizona politics writerStaffers of at least one Congressional office, Rep. Tim Griffin (R-Ark.), distributed a \"watch list\" that features six activists who are constituents of Rep. Daniel Webster (R-Fla.), each of whom was openly critical of Webster at his town halls earlier this year.Read Post | CommentsJared Bernstein, 8/10/11Senior Fellow, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesSometimes it\u0027s useful to look at something in a different way -- maybe you\u0027ll shake loose a new idea.Read Post | CommentsSen. Kirsten Gillibrand, 8/10/11U.S. Senator from New YorkThroughout our history, the United States has led the world in scientific innovation. It is time we continued that tradition by developing safer, more effective chemicals to use in our clothing, buildings and household products.Read Post | CommentsDylan Ratigan, 8/10/11Host of MSNBC\u0027s \"The Dylan Ratigan Show\" and author of the soon to be released book, \"Greedy Bastards\"It\u0027s time for America to understand our situation, and make sure that our friends and family do as well. Our politicians and bankers play on our ignorance, since they think we won\u0027t know what they are doing. That ends now.Read Post | CommentsRev. Al Sharpton, 8/10/11President, National Action NetworkLet us remember that even in the face of fire hoses, hate groups and imminent death, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. never faltered in his dedication to peaceful opposition.Read Post | CommentsJeanette Jenkins, 8/10/11Founder and president of \"The Hollywood Trainer\"The core is a group of muscles just like any other area in your body, and you must train them if you want them to improve with better strength, tone, endurance and flexibility.Read Post | CommentsStephanie Sarkis, Ph.D., 8/10/11PsychotherapistI was a college student for 11 years.

Here are 50 things I\u0027ve learned.Read Post | CommentsPeter Navarro and Greg Autry, 8/10/11Author, \u0027Death by China: Confronting the Dragon -- A Global Call to Action\u0027America\u0027s decade of disaster has an obvious cause and a solution entirely outside the mainstream media\u0027s myopic discussion of tax cuts and stimulus spending. It is time to admit the China trade is neither free nor fair and in any case it\u0027s killing us.Read Post | CommentsAdam Winkler, 8/10/11Professor of Law, UCLARobert Bork is, in some ways, the intellectual leader of the Tea Party\u0027s legal vision. And that\u0027s exactly why Mitt Romney chose him. Having Bork head up his legal team sends a message that Romney is a True Conservative.Read Post | CommentsAlan Miller, 8/10/11Writer, Filmmaker, and Director, The NY Salon.I am someone who argues repeatedly that real change, historically, only ever comes about from ordinary people taking to the streets and demanding it. The riots we\u0027re seeing, however, are a million miles from anything like that.Read Post | CommentsMarshall Fine, 8/10/11Author and film critic, hollywoodandfine.comSome will say: This is yet another movie about the civil-rights movement moment in our history, in which the white people are the heroes, saving the black characters. But that\u0027s far too simplistic a reading of The Help.Read Post | CommentsMichael Kugelman, 8/10/11South Asia program associate, Woodrow Wilson International Center for ScholarsPakistan will neither attain lasting food, energy, and water security, nor educate its masses, until its political leadership removes the indigenous obstacles that have long constrained the country\u0027s development.Read Post | CommentsKerry Kennedy, 8/10/11President of the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice \u0026 Human RightsMore than a year after a private company operating in public waters retched 170 million gallons of crude and 2 million gallons of toxic dispersants into the Gulf of Mexico, we still lack reliable statistics on the BP oil disaster\u0027s impact on the health of residents.Read Post | CommentsJonathan Lewis, 2011.08.11Turnstyle, 2011.08.10Shan Wells, 2011.08.10Leah Mayor, 2011.08.10Tony Newman, 2011.08.10Christine Bronstein, 2011.08.10BritChick Paris, 2011.08.10Dr Kishan Manocha, 2011.08.10Emma Norris, 2011.08.10Darren Braham, 2011.08.10","h1":"Using a mobile device?
