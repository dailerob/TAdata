{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jason LinkinsEditor, Eat the PressAs HuffPost\u0027s Ryan Reilly reported, Obama had a lot of reasons to cite in favor of closure: \"I think it is critical for us to understand that Guantanamo is not necessary to keep us safe. It is expensive, it is inefficient, it hurts us in terms of our international standing, it lessens cooperation with our allies on counterterrorism efforts, it is a recruitment tool for extremists. It needs to be closed.\" All basically true. But if there\u0027s anything driving renewed attention to the infamous detention center, it\u0027s that things have recently gone ass-over-tea kettle at the facility. As recently as three days ago, 100 of the detainees were involved in a mass hunger strike, and the military had to call in reinforcements to facilitate force-feeding. Mo\u0027 Gitmo, mo\u0027 problems, in other words. What\u0027s the solution? Well, there it gets vague.Comments (462)Emily PeckManaging Editor, HuffPost BusinessThe daughter of one of the world\u0027s most shameless bankers has apparently discovered the secret shame of all working women everywhere.Comments (66)Ben AffleckAcademy Award-winning producer and writerAs a nation we both claim a noble position in the world and assert a reputation for fostering freedom, human rights and fairness here and abroad. If indeed we are to live up to that, we cannot abide having some among us who starve.Comments (34)Jonathan RauchAuthor, \u0027Denial: My 25 Years Without a Soul\u0027When he came out of the closet this week, becoming the first openly gay player the NBA, center Jason Collins said he had \"baked for 33 years\" in the heat of his secret. Millions of gay Americans have sweated in that same heat. But many of us can go Collins one better.Comments (62)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Trickle-down economics is the first cousin of austerity economics. Austerity is nuts when so many millions are out of work. And as we\u0027ve learned before, trickle-down is a fraud. Nothing ever trickles down.Comments (222)Allen FrancesProfessor Emeritus, Duke UniversityDSM-5 represents a wholesale, imperial medicalization of normality. So many new and untested diagnoses; so many reduced thresholds for the old ones. Pretty soon everyone will have a diagnosis and many will have a whole bunch of them.Comments (28)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorNominal wages for incumbent workers are still pretty sticky. If you\u0027re lucky enough to have a job, think about your own case. I suspect you haven\u0027t seen much in the way of raises, but has your salary actually been cut in nominal terms?CommentsChez PazienzaCo-host, \u0027The Bubble Genius Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027; writer, Deus Ex MalcontentRon Paul is aiming his ire at the men and women who most of us felt were doing their absolute best to protect us as a couple of killers were on the loose in Boston. Is the government never, under any circumstances, to be trusted, no matter how many local citizens it may be made up of?CommentsPeter DreierE.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeUnlike the rest of the world\u0027s democracies, the United States doesn\u0027t use the metric system, doesn\u0027t require employers to provide workers with paid vacations, hasn\u0027t abolished the death penalty, and doesn\u0027t celebrate May Day as an official national holiday.Comments (98)Ann BrenoffSenior Writer, The Huffington PostIncreasingly more unmarried 20-somethings are having babies, the U.S. Census Bureau tells us. What the U.S. Census Bureau doesn\u0027t tell us is who is supporting and raising those kids. Here\u0027s one not-so-crazy thought: A lot of midlifers are getting pressed into service to help raise their grandchildren.Comments (52)Warren K. ZolaAssistant Dean for Graduate Programs, Carroll School of Management at Boston CollegeThe NCAA and President Mark Emmert seem incapable of reorienting college athletics within higher education as a positive component of the campus experience, instead embarking on a Darwinian chase for revenue. Student welfare and development is no longer the priority but an afterthought.CommentsRichard (RJ) EskowWriter; host, \u0027The Breakdown\u0027; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureWe urgently need to repeal the sequester. But it\u0027s even more important to repeal the insane thinking that led us there. \"Financial innovation\" wasn\u0027t all that innovative. Some of it was just unregulated lending. A lot of it was old-fashioned fraud. Above all else, we must demand growth.The economic principles which predicted austerity\u0027s failure are the same principles which show us how to grow our way out of this horrible economy -- with government spending on infrastructure, education, science, postal services and a whole host of other functions.CommentsJonathan WeilerDirector of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel HillIt is true that we\u0027ve come a long way as a society in rejecting the mindless prejudices that have long relegated gays to the closet, legally and socially. But it\u0027s a joke to argue, as Limbaugh does, that the Tim Tebows of the world are unfairly persecuted in comparison with the Jason Collins of the world.Comments (45)Josh Blackman and Lisa McElroyWith the democratization and twitterization of the Boston Marathon investigation, the future of the national security state is here -- for better, and worse.CommentsLinda BergtholdHealth policy researcherIf you have not been sick lately, you may not be aware that Obamacare is actually already being implemented, and the implementation is going fairly smoothly.Comments (534)Jessica Prois and Eleanor GoldbergWe\u0027re not inclined to upload photos of artisan sandwiches to Instagram, but this week we\u0027re going all out for good reason. Except there\u0027ll be no pictures of arugula or baguettes in sight. We\u0027ve taken on the Global Poverty Project\u0027s Live Below the Line challenge to spend $1.50 a day on food and drink for five days.Comments (110)Arianna HuffingtonBecoming Fearless is part of our larger effort to put the spotlight on what is working in our culture rather than just on what\u0027s dysfunctional. Taken individually, these stories inspire. Taken together, they testify to something larger -- that in the face of multiple crises, people are responding with strength, courage and resilience.Comments (29)Howard FinemanEditorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupToday, celebrity is driving digital and social media, in society and in journalism. Will it unite us for the common good and for the good of commerce? Or will it divide, distract and dumb us down in an atavistic search for the attention that begets \"traffic\" that begets advertising that begets profits that beget power?Comments (87)Maria EitelPresident, Nike FoundationWe cannot leave girls out of the equation. Why? Because adolescent girls are uniquely disadvantaged, yet they have the most potential to make the greatest change.CommentsDana McMahanFood, Travel and Fitness WriterI blogged about weightlifting and grew into a community, online and off, of women and men who loved lifting heavy. My story of walking into a gym unable to do a pushup and transforming, in my mid-30s, into a record-breaking powerlifter even inspired some to take up sports or join a gym.Comments (45)Neal JensonManaging Director, Qazztek \u0026 BBSIf you are like most of us, you are going to spend most of your lifetime at work; so you should enjoy it. The best way to ensure you have a good work day is to take preemptive measures.Comments (28)David HoffmanPresident Emeritus and Founder, Internews NetworkMay 3rd marks World Press Freedom Day. While we pause to honor those journalists who have been killed or imprisoned, it is important to realize the growing role media play in global politics and the changes that are redefining what it means to be a journalist.CommentsAlyssa CarterOnline marketerWe never saw it coming, but the fabric of my family would be tested by tragedy after two bombs were detonated at this year\u0027s Boston Marathon.CommentsDr. Harold KoplewiczChild and Adolescent Psychiatrist; President, Child Mind InstituteIn the wake of the Newtown shooting, President Obama called for a national conversation about mental health. But that conversation really begins in your home and your community, and it doesn\u0027t start and stop with individual tragedies.CommentsPaul AbramsLast person on Earth not on FacebookAlthough well-understood as a key element in D.C.-dysfunction, it is not so widely appreciated just how destructive the filibuster, as abused by the Republicans, has been.Comments (133)Sasha AlexanderActressAs mothers, we are bound not only to help protect our own children, but all children. Vaccines provide a safety net; the more we vaccinate, the more society is protected from sometimes-fatal diseases.CommentsJeff DanzigerPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideComments (25)Edward SchneiderTravel, cooking and food writerDuck with olives is a classic, and of course, sweetness is common in sauces for duck, so long as it is balanced by acidity. So why not sweetened olives?CommentsAmb. Marc GinsbergFmr. U.S. Ambassador to Morocco \u0026 White House Middle East AdviserI am resigned to having the U.S. remain color blind to red lines, largely because the options for credible retaliation are so wretchedly unpalatable. We will be hearing in the coming days about lots of options... until they are exposed to the cold, cruel light of day.CommentsLea GroverWriter and toddler-wranglerI know you didn\u0027t expect most of this. I know you didn\u0027t anticipate loving somebody so intensely, or loathing your post-baby body so much, or being so tired, or being the mom you\u0027ve turned out to be.Comments (90)Dr. Lisa YoungNationally-recognized nutritionist; Adjunct professor of nutrition at NYU; Author, \u0027The Portion Teller Plan\u0027It is possible to eat out and consume upward of 2,000 calories in just one meal. However, it is also entirely possible not to break your calorie budget and to eat healthfully while eating out. The key is to be mindful of your food choices and to choose wisely.CommentsJared Bernstein, 2013. 1.05Tabby Biddle, 2013. 1.05Chez Pazienza, 2013. 1.05Pratik Dattani, 2013. 1.05Richard (RJ) Eskow, 2013. 1.05Levi Ben-Shmuel, 2013. 1.05Chris Weigant, 2013. 1.05Ben Affleck, 2013. 1.05Linda Bloom LCSW and Charlie Bloom MSW, 2013. 1.05Candy Spelling, 2013. 1.05Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"SEQUESTER FESTER: TOWN HALL FURY VS.
