{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Executive Features Editor, The Huffington Post Media GroupToday, The Huffington Post begins a year-long series, called \"Faith Shift,\" to explore and examine America\u0027s changing religious landscape. Through on-the-ground, character-driven stories, our religion reporter Jaweed Kaleem will show us how people of varied faiths and cultures are reacting and adapting to contemporary issues. Our coverage will focus on the one essential question: \"Does religion still matter?\" We have our own answer: Yes, but not in the ways that you think.Read Post | Comments (158)Marlo Thomas, 03/29/12Award-winning actress, author, and activistEven if you have to drive across state lines to see Bully, your kids need to be in the audience. Whether you know it or not, they may be among the 13 million American children affected by bullying every year. For them, this is more than just a movie. It is real life.Read Post | Comments (71)Robert Reich, 03/29/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Aftershock\u0027The Dallas Fed argues that the Fed\u0027s easy money policy can\u0027t be much help to the U.S. economy as long as Wall Street is \"still clogged with toxic assets accumulated in the boom years.\" So what\u0027s the answer? It\u0027s \"breaking up the nation\u0027s biggest banks into smaller units.\"Read Post | Comments (101)Arianna Huffington, 03/28/12In negotiating with John Boehner, why did the Obama administration prioritize debt reduction? Millions did what Obama asked in 2008 and voted their hopes, but how many were hoping for the Grand Bargain we really got?Read Post | Comments (1,335)Geoffrey Dunn, 03/29/12Author, \u0027The Lies of Sarah Palin\u0027Sarah Palin is now busting Mitt Romney\u0027s chops whenever she can for not having sufficient \"conservative instincts\". But during Palin\u0027s successful 2006 gubernatorial campaign in Alaska, both Palin\u0027s and Romney\u0027s political ambitions converged.Read Post | Comments (17)John Prendergast, 03/29/12Co-founder, Enough ProjectRead Post | CommentsAnya Strzemien, 03/29/12Editor-in-Chief of Stylelist, Stylelist Home and HuffPost StyleEven though I\u0027m not normally one for saccharine self-affirmations and cheesy platitudes, I want to use the comments section of this post to flip the script and ask you all to say something positive about yourselves.Read Post | Comments (12)Bob Cesca, 03/28/12Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez Show, Media ProducerIt\u0027s difficult to assign psychological motive when it comes to political tactics, but based upon the collective behavior of far-right conservative Republicans, we can only deduce that a considerable number of them are bullies and ought to be treated as such.Read Post | Comments (1,223)Pamela Mays McDonald, 03/28/12As the Supreme Court, on this third and final day, weighs the future of the Affordable Care Act (AKA \"Obamacare\"), the saga of Kenya\u0027s journey these past few months demonstrates the life-or-death significance of the Court\u0027s deliberations.Read Post | CommentsRobert L. Borosage, 03/29/12President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureThe Great Recession exposed deep systemic weaknesses in our economy. The test is not whether we can reflate another bubble, but whether we can build a new foundation for sustained growth and shared prosperity.Read Post | Comments (80)Dan Rather, 03/29/12Host, \u0027Dan Rather Reports\u0027Two weeks ago, I made the transit through the Strait of Hormuz to the Arabian Sea. Surrounded by a destroyer, a missile cruiser and several Seahawk helicopters, we were hardly inconspicuous as we transited the Strait. And that is the point.Read Post | Comments (18)Paul Douglas, 03/29/12Meteorologist; Author, \u0027Restless Skies, the Ultimate Weather Book\u0027I\u0027m going to tell you something that my Republican friends are loath to admit out loud: climate change is real. But my climate epiphany wasn\u0027t overnight, and it had nothing to do with Al Gore.Read Post | Comments (169)Dave, 03/29/12Husband, father, and intergalactic being of energy only on this plane of existence for a brief timeOver the past few months my wife has been asked numerous times what I think about our 7-year-old son identifying as gay. The idea that I would be disappointed/angry/suicidal that my son identifies as gay offends me, both as a father and simply as a human.Read Post | Comments (78)Dr. Susanne Bennett, 03/28/12Holistic Chiropractor specializing in allergies, environmental and functional medicineAccording to the American Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Immunology, approximately 40 million Americans suffer from allergies, with four million workdays lost annually due to hay fever alone.Read Post | Comments (11)Harvey Fierstein, 03/29/12Multiple Tony Award-Winning ActorI wanted to make at least one cogent argument defending print media to a culture that doesn\u0027t seem to care if the daily paper disappears altogether. What could that argument be?Read Post | Comments (19)John Feffer, 03/29/12Co-director, Foreign Policy In FocusThe conservative mainstream still calls the president\u0027s religious beliefs into question, but they stop just short of accusing him of apostasy and concealment. What they consider safe is the assertion that Obama is acting as if he were Muslim.Read Post | CommentsJane Chafin, 03/29/12Director, Offramp Gallery, Pasadena, CAJohn Singer Sargent\u0027s career would go on to survive the scandal, while Amélie Gautreau\u0027s reputation would never fully recover -- she was no longer the \"it girl.\"Read Post | CommentsGeorge Hobica, 03/29/12Syndicated travel journalist and founder of Airfarewatchdog.comThousands of airplanes take off and touch down every day without incident, but every now and then -- as we were so vividly reminded this week with the story of the JetBlue pilot and his midair meltdown -- things can go spectacularly wrong.Read Post | CommentsHeather Pilatic, 03/29/12Co-director, Pesticide Action Network North AmericaPesticides are prevalent, persistent and more scientists confirm everyday that they are making bees sick (or dead). The sad truth? Beekeepers have been sounding this alarm from the ground for years. Would that we had listened.Read Post | CommentsMelinda Gates, 03/29/12Co-chair, the Bill and Melinda Gates FoundationThere\u0027s no greater honor than to take to the stage alongside a line-up of individuals from around the globe for whom I have such great respect. This year\u0027s speakers are all unique in their talents and perspectives, but they also have much in common: a strong belief in our ability to change the world for good.Read Post | CommentsJohn H. Jackson, 03/29/12President and CEO, The Schott Foundation for Public EducationIn confronting any other national security threat, the U.S. wouldn\u0027t trust unreliable and unproven solutions. Why, then, do some in the education sector insist we gamble on the privatization of our public schools?Read Post | CommentsHaskell Wexler, 03/29/12Academy Award-winning CinematographerI love to make films. But the health of my fellow film workers and citizens is more important than anything on the silver screen. Government regulators seem afraid to confront Hollywood, and they have fallen short on protecting workers\u0027 hours in our industry.Read Post | Comments (15)Al Quinlan and Andrew Baumann, 03/29/12Conservatives and Republicans are already attacking the administration over the new carbon dioxide regulations, but they are doing so at their own peril. When it comes to these new standards, voters are firmly in the White House\u0027s corner.Read Post | CommentsMJ Rosenberg, 03/29/12Senior Foreign Policy Fellow, Media Matters Action NetworkThe difference between Netanyahu and most Israelis, I believe, is that for them the situation today is nothing like the situation in the 1940s. Israel is not the Warsaw Ghetto, a comparison that insults both the memory of the Holocaust and Israel itself.Read Post | CommentsJonathan Kim, 03/29/12Film Critic for ReThink Reviews, the Uprising Show, What the Flick?!When you see what Alex endures on a daily basis and imagine yourself in his shoes, it becomes starkly evident how bullying would make any kid want to avoid school or do something even more drastic to end their suffering, and why it\u0027s vital that we make our schools bully-free environments.Read Post | CommentsRobert Scheer, 03/29/12Editor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027The Supreme Court is so full of it. The entire institution, as well as its sanctimonious judges themselves, reeks of a time-honored hypocrisy steeped in the arrogance that justice is served by unaccountable elitism.Read Post | Comments (271)Tom Vander Ark, 2012.29.03Richard (RJ) Eskow, 2012.29.03Sharief Easterling, 2012.29.03William Bradley, 2012.29.03Alisha L.
