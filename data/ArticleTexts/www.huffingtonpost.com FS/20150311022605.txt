{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027There is no doubt that a ruling for the plaintiffs would be bad news. It would deny millions of people subsidies in the states without their own exchanges. If the situation is not quickly remedied, it will also lead to the collapse of the exchanges in these states, as more healthy people stop buying insurance. An adverse decision also will mean that the Republican appointees to the Supreme Court are nothing more than adjuncts to the Republican Party who care nothing about the law or the constitution. But even a bad decision from a court that has no respect for the law need not be the end of the Affordable Care Act. If the Democrats can resist the urge for preemptive surrender, the dynamics should work in the direction of pushing the Republican states towards creating exchanges.1. The \"job creators\" are CEOs, corporations, and the rich, whose taxes must be low in order to induce them to create more jobs. Rubbish.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027ODS (Obama Derangement Syndrome) won\u0027t work out any better for Republicans in 2016 than ABB (Anyone But Bush) did for Democrats in 2004. Voters still expect you to stand for something not just against whatever the president of the opposing party is doing.Chair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusThe FCC\u0027s decision is one of the most pro-business policies ever enacted by an agency under the Obama administration. Yet the so-called defenders of business refuse to see it.Communications consultantThe ongoing trade deficit has transferred trillions of dollars out of our economy. It has cost us millions of jobs, tens of thousands of factories and entire industries. As it continues, it is costing us our ability to make a living as a country -- except for our financial sector. This has made a very few people unimaginably wealthy, but it has made the rest of us, and the country, poorer.Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureWhen we as a society allow incidents such as this to persist, we are labeling our young people, especially young African American men in this case and telling them once again you are not allowed a seat at the table and, what\u0027s worse, we heckle and laugh and attempt to destroy your dignity and ultimately your humanity.Mental Health AdvocatePyongyang has still not reached a consensus inside the country on how to move beyond this tired strategy, and it will take the regime some time to do so. In some respects it does make sense to pressurize North Korea, but perhaps more in terms of missed economic opportunities than saber rattling.Chairman and CEO of the JoongAng Media NetworkA clinical assistant professor of medicine at the Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine, Rubin Naiman is particularly interested in dreams. In answer to my questions, he passionately and eloquently makes the case that we can truly benefit from opening ourselves to our dreams and meeting them on their own terms rather than trying to view them through the lens of waking life.At the height of the outbreak from October to December (2014) the epidemic was out of control. The situation for several reasons was starting to look hopeless. A nightmare was unfolding before our very eyes! Those of us who were living through this terror at Ebola ground zero were bracing ourselves for the worst.Vicar General, Orthodox Archdiocesan District of Sierra LeoneA few years ago I took a very big leap and decided to go to Europe on my own. Since childhood I\u0027d traveled all over the world with family and friends, but I\u0027d never gone on a trip by myself. The very idea terrified me. But surprisingly, one of the things that made the experience so enjoyable was traveling by myself.AuthorThere\u0027s a difference between having your feelings hurt and being systemically denied access to the things you need to succeed in life. You can ask someone five easy questions.Seattle-based writerI recently came across several profiles in The Huffington Post\u0027s series \"All Work, No Pay: The False Promise of the American Economy.\" I strongly disagree that the promise of America is false, but the moving profiles of Americans struggling to make it in today\u0027s economy do tell an important story. I am writing to explain how I believe conservative reforms will create opportunity for all.U.S. senator from FloridaThere were young men dying and health care workers in \"hazmat\" suiting covered head to toe. People were unwilling to touch, comfort or hold many of these dying, frightened men. It was the many members of the lesbian community and straight female allies that came to our aid.Four-time Olympic gold medalist, gay man living with HIV, and activistForgetting man\u0027s past atrocities or ignoring those happening, now, today, in too many places around the world, is both callous and short-sighted. That is bad enough. But it\u0027s equally hazardous to ignore the astonishing and perilous acts of human courage that negate, undo, reverse the violence and uphold our rights and dignity as humans.Author; Nobel Peace Prize laureatePhilanthropist; Businessman; Co-founder, 100 LivesThe Republican Senators, by sending this letter, have shown a marked preference not only for military confrontation, but military confrontation with the risk of gravely accelerating the nuclear arms race. It imperils a whole region in the Middle East already reeling from violent extremism.Professor of Theology, Chicago Theological SeminaryMuslims were indeed here from the beginning, but the beliefs and practices they brought with them only rarely endured. Their experiences serve as a reminder that every faith woven into the fabric of our country has been made up of strands both light and dark.Historian, novelist, and journalist.At age 7, I began counting calories and lost seven pounds. I remember that number, because I had apparently done better than my grandmother, who had also recently gone on a diet.There\u0027s no wrong way to be a woman.While U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is trying to negotiate the most critical elements of a deal to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons and avoid war, the Republicans are actively trying to undermine his efforts to get a deal.Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersWith each passing day since these shows were announced, it has become clearer that the \"Fare Thee Well\" concept, ostensibly conceived to pay tribute to a beloved band on the occasion of its 50th anniversary, bears little resemblance to the Grateful Dead.Founder/publisher of Boulder Weekly, an award-winning alternative weekly in its 22nd year of publication.Protesting Oklahoma students and a no-nonsense university president took swift and forceful action against the hate on their campus. But what happens when there is no over the top, outrageous racist video that goes viral to stir student and public wrath?Author and political analystNine years ago, when my first baby was born and those eating disorders and body image issues still stood way too close, these experiences would have really bothered me -- but today I know the truth of it.Wife of one, mom of six boys, author, editor, musician, blogger at Crash Test Parents and Racheltoalson.comWe are hearing a great deal from those in our society who would like to turn the clock back on voting rights, civil rights, and the right to peaceably assemble. But I believe there are many more people of good will among us than various news reports might lead us to believe. Hopefully, more of them will raise their voices in continuance of our search for \"a more perfect Union.\"We take issue of campus sexual assault very seriously (unlike some others). In the coming weeks and months of this campaign, we hope that The Hunting Ground inspires serious debate and serious discussion from journalists and policy-makers alike. We owe that much to students.Filmmaker, \"The Hunting Ground\"Filmmaker, \"The Hunting Ground\"I was a member of this chapter 14 years ago. The second Black man to be initiated in those halls. I thought we were different. Maybe I was just being hopeful. I believed in S-A-E. I believed in the True Gentlemen. I believed my brothers were my brothers. I believed my son should be their brother if he so chose one day. But then I saw that video.Associate, Gungoll Jackson, Box and Devoll, PCIn many ways, I grew up at the Pentagon. Our family never sat for a formal portrait. We didn\u0027t take snapshots at parties or picnics or on vacation. But what we do have is photo albums stuffed with pictures taken at the Pentagon as we protested there year after year after year.Columnist, Waging Nonviolence; author of \"It Runs in the Family: On Being Raised by Radicals and Growing into Rebellious Motherhood\"This is our chance to tell our politicians face-to-face what we really think: We\u0027re sick and tired of big money in politics. We\u0027re fed up with elections that look more like auctions. We\u0027re disgusted by election laws that permit \"legalized bribery.\"Co-Founder, Ben \u0026 Jerry\u0027s Ice Cream and Head Stamper, StampStampede.orgIf Seinfeld is TV\u0027s funniest sitcom, what in turn is the funniest joke from TV\u0027s funniest sitcom? And would this joke then, by sheer elimination, be the funniest line ever uttered in a situation comedy?Award-winning TV, humor and music writerHere are 5 simple and delicious Japanese recipes to honor springtime.pickledplum.comMake sure you\u0027re the first to speak up, so that no one steals your quote. And when you read the quote, read it emphatically, taking long, thoughtful pauses. And when you\u0027re done, close your eyes, as if you\u0027re savoring every last morsel of literary goodness.Writer, comedian and creator of TheCooperReview.comHouse Republicans ironically named their No Child Left Behind reauthorization bill the Student Success Act, which attempts to gut our public education system and take vital funding away from the neediest students. This bill is paving the way for the privatization of education through the expansion of voucher programs.U.S. Representative for Wisconsin’s 2nd congressional districtPut some coffee on and get cookin\u0027.Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"IT\u0027S OBAMA\u0027S FAULT!",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
