{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor, historian, authorThe Republican-controlled Congress is not \"dysfunctional.\" It would \"function\" perfectly well if there were an occupant in the White House who gave the Republicans everything they wanted. With divided government they act like petulant children. Voices in the press decrying \"dysfunction\" render invisible the corporate oligarchy that has bought off the institution. Whether attacking Planned Parenthood and women\u0027s reproductive rights, trying to privatize everything from the Veterans Administration to the U.S. Postal Service, handing over Social Security to Wall Street, selling off federal lands, obstructing everything President Obama does, or the million other hidden giveaways to banks, corporations, and the NRA -- all these actions drive home the point that we have the worst Congress money can buy.Last week, I had the pleasure of participating in TEDTalks 2016, where I discussed many of the challenges presented by the climate crisis. But a powerful shift has been taking place, and it is clear that we will ultimately prevail. Here\u0027s why.Chairman, Generation Investment Management and The Climate Reality ProjectThere\u0027s been a theme among some gay Republicans that implies Donald Trump isn\u0027t so bad on equality for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people, or is at least better than most of the other GOP candidates. It\u0027s absolutely false -- he\u0027s as extreme as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio.Queer Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostThese stories of people from China, Somalia, Mali, Sudan, and Tunisia -- testaments to the impact, importance and diversity of global cinema -- have been smothered in the U.S. by the volume of attention given to five words of mine at an opening press conference, which is too bad.Actress and activistThere has to be a point in the evolution of consumer privacy (or its disintegration) where we can no longer lower our standards as fast as our situation is deteriorating. When it comes to our privacy we really have to stand firm -- and Tim Cook is doing that.Author of Swiped. Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Co-founder of Credit.com and IDT911Every so often, a state judge\u0027s conflict of interest in deciding a particular case is so extreme and antithetical to fundamental fairness that the Supreme Court needs to step in to cleanse the taint.Senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of LawFor billions of families around the world, the challenges of energy and time are very different from ours -- and these challenges have a huge impact on their ability to realize their potential.Co-chair, the Bill and Melinda Gates FoundationCo-chair, the Bill and Melinda Gates FoundationAlmost all of us (96 percent) have heard of Alzheimer\u0027s disease. Nearly four in five of us know, or have known, someone that has been diagnosed with it. But even with all of that first-hand experience, we aren\u0027t doing much about it.Award-winning journalist, bestselling author and leading Alzheimer’s advocateWithout that extra day every fourth year, our ancient friends would begin to miss their annual appointments, and start to fall behind in wishing us prompt birthday greetings, like forgetful Facebook friends. Without February 29, roughly, every four years, the \"constant stars\" would cease to be constant.Independent source of news and analysis, from the academic and research community.The relationship between black lives and blue uniforms is one that demands our attention if we are going to make progress toward a tomorrow where liberation is achieved. Under the radar of what many are talking about now, is the relationship that law enforcement on college and university campuses have with the surrounding community.Executive Director of Million Hoodies Movement for JusticeNot much incentive -- if any -- exists within the Pentagon to play down the threats it perceives itself as facing. Like a business, the Pentagon wants to enlarge its market share and power.  Like a church, it\u0027s jealous of its authority and stocked with true believers.Writer, Professor, Retired Lt. Colonel, Air ForceFlattening Beirut has been done before. Flattening Gaza has been done before. And both may be done again if Israel\u0027s license to kill with impunity is left unchecked.Instructor, Lebanese American University. Middle East Analyst and Commentator.North Carolina native Thomas Wolfe famously wrote, \"You can\u0027t go home again.\" But another native son of the Tarheel State, Caleb Caudle, is proving Wolfe wrong.Entertainment WriterWhat progressive wouldn\u0027t relish the thought of Donald Trump as the Republican nominee? But there should be no sugarcoating the long-term dangers that an irreligious Republican party presents.Assistant Professor of Political Science, Chapman UniversityPlease accept my sincere congratulations for having Donald Trump as your present frontrunner and, after Tuesday, likely presidential nominee. You\u0027ve worked so very hard to get him here, and I applaud you for your efforts.Writer with a passion for social justice; blogger, Pulse of My NationOriginating from Kentucky, the rare breed, named the McConnell Turtle by scientists, is on a rampage. Over the past several years, this ancient reptile has caused immense trouble to Washington, D.C. that has large-scale effects on the country as a whole.Comedy writer, stand-up comic, and racially ambiguous person. @BrandtHamiltonIf I hear one more middle-aged person tell me how good I have it because I was born in the \u002790s, I\u0027m going to literally barf so hard I shoot backwards across the room.Writer, satirist, tiny dancerUnless you consider an expanding series of failed states, spreading terror movements, wrecked cities, and countries hemorrhaging refugees as accomplishments, in these years, no goal of Washington -- not a single one -- has been accomplished by war.Editor, TomDispatch.comI never had the dream to be a writer or a director or anything else I learned to do on this film. I just wanted to act. But no one was giving me a job. I wanted my voice heard, and I was willing to do whatever it takes.Actress, Director, Writer, Producer \u0026 EditorNEW DELHI -- Modi is using the nationalism card to deflect political discourse away from his failures. He has lost key state elections, the economy is faltering and there is a palpable sense that he is unable to deliver. And the situation may soon get worse. The next general elections are in 2019. Who knows how many of us are going to be arrested for sedition, called terrorist if we are Muslim or beaten up by lynch mobs before then.JournalistDonald Trump just won his third primary, taking Nevada with a commanding 46 percent of the Republican vote. If you take a look back at his campaign so far, you will see a long trail of wishful Washington thinking that was proven wrong and had to be tossed to the side of the road.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comDivorce isn\u0027t for the weak. Hell, it isn\u0027t even for the strong. You can think you\u0027re prepared and ready, but it still won\u0027t ready you for what\u0027s to come. My own divorce has thrown me completely for a loop.A new generation of women figuring out what motherhood means for us.With Netflix about to unveil the Full House sequel whimsically called Fuller House, it\u0027s safe to say some fans of the original have wondered over these last 20 years how life was treating D.J. Tanner and her friends.Writer, Bob Dylan fan, memorized every line in \u0027Casablanca\u0027If we support Clinton in the primary now, without confronting this history, it excuses and rewards this behavior, affirming that there is no political cost to throwing Black people under the bus, and making it more likely that Hillary Clinton and other Democrats will continue to use racism for political gain.Activist, Entrepreneur, Co-founder of ColorOfChange.org and Citizen Engagement LabWhen my son died, I didn\u0027t get a manual on what to do. I didn\u0027t get an orientation into how to be a grieving parent. So when some people asked how they could help me and my family, I really didn\u0027t know. For those that want to help, here is a list of 31 ways you can provide practical and timely help to grieving parents:Shepherd, wife and mother of four amazing childrenScience fiction films and books have created a hunger for Oculus-style, head-mounted displays (HMDs) and \"immersive\" experiences, but does wearing a pair of goggles really have more power to transport us? Based on my 10 years of experience in the field I don\u0027t think so.Caltech VR PhD, internationally renowned artist, and 3dSunshine founderDo what you say you\u0027re going to do. Tell the truth.Mommy. Former Corporate American. New Freelancer/Risk-Taker. Foodie. Traveler. Spiritualist. Simple Living Learner.Senate Republicans have given him absolutely no reason to play nice with them nor observe the asinine gentility that obfuscates the partisan rancor of that institution.Writer and historianThis year, I saw every one of the 31 nominated feature films and 15 nominated shorts. Here are my random comments on most of the categories.Editor-in-Chief, AllGov.comMost parents don\u0027t realize that symptoms such as snoring or consistently waking up in the night could be a sign of a more serious medical condition. Preschool is the peak time for sleep issues and these are things you should be on the lookout for.Sweet Dreamzzz PR Coordinator. Passion for writing \u0026 media.Stop making light of the gluten-free diet. Are there people out there following a gluten-free diet for its perceived health benefits? Absolutely. Is it tempting to make fun of cultural fads? Certainly. Would we make fun of people with diabetes for needing to monitor their diets and use insulin? No. People with celiac disease don\u0027t have a choice.CEO of Beyond CeliacGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day. Newsletters may offer personalized content or advertisements.
