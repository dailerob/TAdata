{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureThe Fight for 15 movement is gaining momentum. It has won victories in Los Angeles, Los Angeles County, San Francisco, Seattle and SeaTac. Yesterday, a New York State Wage Board formally recommended a $15.00 minimum wage for the fast food industry in New York. Governor Cuomo could move that to into law after reviewing it. The University of California just announced it would raise its minimum wage for several thousand workers to $15.00. The $15.00 minimum is likely headed to a referendum vote in the District of Columbia next year. Pressure is now building on the president to act. He deserves credit for issuing orders raising the minimum wage of contract employees to $10.10, and requiring contractors to obey various workplace laws. Now federal employees are striking for $15.00 and a union.My friend, actor, singer-guitarist and composer, Paul Hipp, wrote the happy birthday song when he turned fifty. I loved it and asked if I could perform it as I turn ninety-three. Here is the result, and I don\u0027t care what you say, I love it.Founder, People for the American WayWhile it may be accurate to say that a majority of the American public has \"moved on\" with regard to marriage equality, that\u0027s not true among the base of the GOP. And, more critically, the majority of Americans in general hasn\u0027t \"moved on\" when it comes to \"religious liberty\" vs. \"gay rights,\" not by a long shot.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostSince seeing the Sandra Bland video, I\u0027ve been asking myself what I would\u0027ve done if I were in her shoes. In my mind, I hear my momma telling me, \"That\u0027s why I always tell you not to talk back to authority.\"Blog Editor, The Huffington PostMany commentators greeted the agreement with deep skepticism. They dismissed the two years of negotiations with a single assertion: the deal should be rejected because the other side cannot be trusted. Some of these naysayers are right. There is reason to doubt whether the United States can be trusted.Professor of International Affairs, Penn State UniversityThat a taxi-hailing app is an important \"disruptive innovation\" is a distraction from the serious failure of the U.S. to invest significant dollars in transportation infrastructure, particularly new transit that is less polluting.Director, Data JusticeWordsmith, photo nerd, sitcom junkie, dog lover, and Editor at 500px. Everything I ever needed to know I learned from Calvin and Hobbes.The advent of Islam sought not only to introduce a new kind of social order but to limit the excesses of Meccan society, which directly harmed women and girls. Early Islam sought to elevate women and define them as independent agents possessed of free will, responsible for their own actions and imbued with certain rights and privileges over men.Pakistani writer and journalistI love to get my nails done as often as possible. I have a collection of aspirational high heels that I\u0027ll wear once and then never again. Do any of these things take away from the fact that I\u0027m an independent, confidant woman who works hard, loves a lot, and is proud to call herself a feminist? NO.Writer, reader, worshiper of Beyoncé. Musings at alicemcalex.comIn the past, he has advocated government health care, an assault weapons ban, and 14.25 percent flat tax on all wealthy Americans. Now he opposes all three. Does he stand for anything, other than promoting Donald Trump?Professor of Management Practice, Harvard Business SchoolFor the first time, we have comprehensive medical marijuana legislation in both the U.S. House and Senate. The Compassionate Access, Research Expansion, and Respect States Act (CARERS) Act of 2015 is the most comprehensive piece of federal medical marijuana legislation ever introduced in the U.S. Congress.Executive Director, Americans for Safe AccessRepublican Senator Ted Cruz and his colleagues on the far right called their successful efforts to block renewal of the charter of the U.S. Export-Import Bank an \"important victory.\" Unfortunately, their \"victory\" may cost many Americans their jobs.U.S. Representative for New York\u0027s 12th District; Ranking Democrat, Joint Economic CommitteeNot only do we not need that oil and gas -- we can\u0027t even afford to use it if we want to meet the urgent imperative to limit climate disruption.Executive Director, The Sierra ClubEncinia may have treated Bland differently because she was black. We can\u0027t read his mind. But it\u0027s much more likely he treated her the way he did because she didn\u0027t exhibit blind obedience to his every whim, something he was trained not to tolerate and Americans of all political persuasions seem to have acquiesced to without question.Author and columnistHaving a bad memory has a lot of advantages. You never lie, because, what\u0027s the point? You\u0027re great at networking because you can easily have the same conversation over and over again. You Google like a ninja.Writer, comedian and creator of TheCooperReview.comHere\u0027s how detoxing from my phone for 48 hours helped me reset my well-being and develop a healthier relationship with my phone.Lifestyle Associate Social Media Editor, The Huffington PostPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideSometimes, in order to restore order to your life post-relationship, you need to cut all ties. You need to act as if that person has essentially died. You are both ghosts to each other. Will you ever speak again? Maybe. But for the moment you need to find yourself again. You need to find out the person you are sans your partner. You need space and time to be your single solitary self.Black and transgender blogger, activist, and model.Nicki Minaj identified an industry preference for what is seen as attractive, acceptable and what should be rewarded. It shouldn\u0027t be surprising that black artists feel some type of way when their cultural influence is undeniable but remains unrecognized. It is, however, surprising that the industry that still makes money off the backs of black artists still doesn\u0027t take them seriously.Huffington Post Canada blog editorThe problem with mocking the situation is that it ignores the bloody reality of the narcos and specifically of El Chapo. The context of two-way commerce is absent, and there is never any question as to why El Chapo has so many customers in America.syndicated Latin American columnistThis is a historic moment. It marks a huge shift in mainstream thinking about the economy. Workers have won a better life for themselves and their families. We\u0027ve beat back CEO-backed trickle-down economics. But we won\u0027t stop fighting until all workers win higher wages as the movement grows stronger.Executive Director, Citizen Action of New YorkThere is no silver bullet. We need a constitutional amendment. But we also need public funds to amplify small donations. And we also need to reduce barriers to the ballot box, and to increase disclosure of political spending.Executive Vice President for Policy and Program, People For the American Way \u0026 People For the American Way FoundationSocial Security\u0027s benefits are modest and don\u0027t cover a number of eventualities, such as parental leave and sick days, which the Social Security programs of other countries cover. It is time to bolster the economic security of America\u0027s working families.Founding Co-director, Social Security WorksEating disorders are not a choice. Eating disorders are a mental illness like Obsessive Compulsive Disorders, and they are treatable. I get a lot of flak for emphasizing the biological predisposition for eating disorders, for de-emphasizing the personal narrative, for banging on about \"not your fault, not your parents\u0027 fault, not society\u0027s fault.\"Writer and activistTehran, Beijing, Moscow, Islamabad, and New Delhi have been actively establishing interlocking security guarantees. They have been simultaneously calling the Atlanticist bluff when it comes to the endless drumbeat of attention given to the flimsy meme of Iran\u0027s \"nuclear weapons program.\"Roving correspondent for the Asia TimesSummer is a time for sun, fun, exploration and relaxation. Unfortunately, as we unwind there are those who gear up to take advantage of our moments of diversion and distraction. Scammers love summer, too.Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and IDT911Unfortunately, the more interested I am in getting to know a particular person, the worse this will be.

Because the sooner you can get off the bad karma bus, the better the trip through parentsville will inevitably be. Cut others some slack, cut myself some slack and do our best, right?Lifestyle JournalistTEL AVIV -- Netanyahu is an ideologue of Jewish catastrophe: risks and challenges cannot be approached with a view toward resolution; they must be held up as reminders for the Jewish people to keep up their guard.Former Israeli Foreign MinisterTrump seems to think he\u0027s reenacting the \"Swift Boat Veterans for Truth\" campaign against John Kerry. But in reality, it\u0027s more like the Romney 2012 nomination speech that ignored the military, as well as the former CEO\u0027s ineffective battle against McCain for the nomination.Political science professor, LaGrange College in GeorgiaWisconsinites became more and more aware we were dealing with an enemy of democracy.
