{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"From vegatransports.com.auFrom usnews.comDear Tom, welcome to the blogosphere. Always nice to have a new voice in the mix. But since you\u0027re a newbie blogger, I want to give you a hand by pointing out some rookie mistakes your site made in its diatribe about the Huffington Post. First off, you don\u0027t seem to understand the difference between linking to a news story and offering an opinion on said news story. You claim that I\u0027d \"acquired sound intel\" that there are Christians in the Defense Dept. That sounds so cloak and dagger, like a secret fact-finding golf mission to Scotland. Far from \"acquiring intel,\" what we actually did was \"link\" (a key term you should know as a blogger) to a story written for \"Reuters,\" which is a news wire service (a handy place to get \"facts\"). You see, at HuffPost we don\u0027t make up the news. You\u0027re thinking of Fox.READ POST | comments (192)12.13.2006 Matt StollerIf there\u0027s any indication that the business lobby under Republican rule became unbelievably corrupted, look no further than Thomas Donahue.READ POST | comments12.13.2006 Stephen SchlesingerIn his two terms, Annan undoubtedly restored the moral authority to the earth\u0027s preeminent international institution.READ POST | comments12.13.2006 Liz GoldwynRather than offering photographers a free peek while exiting cars, the original queens of burlesque flashed with skill and attitude--and always for the price of admission to the theater.READ POST | comments12.13.2006 Joseph A. PalermoTo avoid another \"national tragedy with immense consequences,\" the Democrats must step up and become as vigilant against the abuse of Executive Power as were their Republican colleagues.READ POST | comments (12)12.13.2006 Kathleen ReardonThe governmental system we now have is an insult to its founders and an albatross around the neck of good people.READ POST | comments12.13.2006 Gerald McEnteeMillions of American workers lack basic rights and respect for the work they do. For proof, look no further than Michigan\u0027s nearly 40,000 family child care providers.READ POST | comments12.13.2006 Michael SmerconishIt\u0027s those decorations. We\u0027ve got to stop them.

That giant sucking sound you hear is your own future, trading lower every day and running out of air while you sleep. Better wake up now and lessen the pain.READ POST | comments12.13.2006 Dave JohnsonWe could END the dominance of big money if each of us gave at least $100 to progressive organizations.READ POST | comments12.13.2006 Bob GeigerBy God, they saved a cross, cracked down on those ten-thousand-acre fetus farms and made sure TV stations will pay through the nose if we ever see Janet Jackson\u0027s nipple again.READ POST | commentsAl EiseleJ.
