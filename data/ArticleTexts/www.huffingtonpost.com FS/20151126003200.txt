{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Award-Winning Author of Freestyle: Reflections on Faith, Family, Justice, and Pop Culture; Founding Pastor of Joy Tabernacle A.M.E. Church in Dallas, TexasTo date, no ISIS member or Syrian refugee has ever bombed or planned to bomb a black church or home. Nor have they walked into a Bible Study in the basement of a black church and unleashed a hail of bullets. Neither are they at fault for the continuing epidemic of unarmed black men, women, boys, and girls murdered by police officers in the streets of America. They have not turned our communities into militarized zones, nor have black people mysteriously died in their prisons. In our seeking forth for justice, let us not overlook the terror long lurking inside our own doors. For whole communities of Americans, the greatest terrorist threat is not now trying to enter our country. It has been here for a long time.The reality is that for the summit to succeed, business leaders must and will stand shoulder to shoulder with world leaders and play a critical supporting role in empowering national governments to agree a path to prosperity for us all.CEO, UnileverThe thin child with big sad eyes and a braid hanging down her back, the one holding a bag containing all her worldly possessions with one hand, and with the other she clutches her baby brother: that refugee girl was once me.SupermodelToday on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women las hermanas Mirabal of the Dominican Republic are honored by the United Nations.

These aren\u0027t just worthy aims. They are also the foundations of our nation\u0027s strength.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027I am trying to stay above water. Trying not to drown in the poisonous pool of hate and ignorance. I am doing what I can, writing the op-eds, making sure the media hears our voices and continuing my daily work in pursuit of justice not only for my own community but for my sister communities.Palestinian-Muslim-American, Racial justice and civil rights activist, community organizer, media commentator, born and raised in Brooklyn.Ted Cruz is so thrilled that someone who wants abortion providers to be killed is supporting him that he actually sent out a press release to celebrate the endorsement.

And Polis, Sinema and Maloney failed miserably at meeting that standard.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostI\u0027ve never had the privilege of visiting Idaho so I can\u0027t say that I know you. I don\u0027t know your specific fears or experiences and I would never presume to minimize or dismiss them. All I can say is that we\u0027re all Americans, and we share the ability to talk to each other with an open mind and an open heart.Truman National Security Fellow, civil servant in the U.S. Department of Defense and a graduate of Georgetown\u0027s School of Foreign ServiceThe people who broke into my home took a framed picture of my children that had been tucked away out of view and put it face down out in the open. This incident occurred as I\u0027m carrying out an investigative reporting project into Mexico\u0027s most high-profile human rights crime.Investigative journalistWhen we cook with a spiritual compass, we are cooking with intention in order minimize waste and be as efficient as possible.

As long as fear is our motivation to unite, in the absence thereof we will also avoid unity.Professor of OntologyBy finally turning the spotlight onto multicultural heroes, brown kids can now see people who look like them be brave and powerful and white kids can see people who don\u0027t look like them be brave and powerful, too.Senior Editor, Huffington Post CanadaThis Monday, animal advocates released a shocking investigation showing widespread cruelty at what some would consider the most unlikely of places -- a top-rated Whole Foods turkey supplier.Researcher, effective altruist, advocateBringing down the monster won\u0027t be easy or happen quickly, even in the best-case scenario.

We\u0027re better and smarter than that -- or at least we should be.Lawyer, retired judge, novelist, columnist @truthdig and lecturer at USC Annenberg School of Communications. Progressive views on law and politics.Thanksgiving is a time for family, food and joy, but unfortunately it can also be a source of health-impacting stress and anxiety for many. Between the influx of visitors and the necessary shopping, cooking and cleaning up, there can be far too little time devoted to reflective conversation with friends and family.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorThis is the first Thanksgiving when our love is officially and legally recognized all across the country. Whether you\u0027re sitting around the table with Aunt Jane and Uncle Bob in Topeka or Tallahassee, you\u0027ve got the federal government on your side when they launch into their ignorant diatribe.Writer and LGBT advocateWhile I applaud the sentiment that Israelis and Palestinians are closely connected, what struck me the most is his characterization of himself, as if being a Jew means automatic support of Netanyahu\u0027s policies, regardless of how misguided they may be.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUIf you are like me, your maiden voyage into motherhood was accompanied by lots of advice.
