{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Military Correspondent, The Huffington PostThere has always been a vast gulf between those who practice politics and those who practice war. Part of that divide is defined by who\u0027s doing hands-dirty, grueling, up-all-night work. Paratroopers were training hard, living in the dirt, getting four hours of sleep a night if they were lucky. Congress was at home. And occasionally engaging in the kind of personal nastiness that wouldn\u0027t be tolerated in an airborne platoon. I thought about that as I squatted down in the Louisiana woods to talk with Cvikota. Four days after his jump, he was standing chest-deep in a fighting position with his weapon aimed at the woodline, taking his turn on guard duty after having worked all night as the battalion\u0027s battle captain.Before the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, MO, recedes in the rear-view mirror, let\u0027s be straight with ourselves about what the events surrounding his death tell us about race in America.Professor of Psychology and Education in the Department of Counseling and Clinical Psychology at Teachers College, Columbia UniversityWe wanted to show that we are still in peril, but more, we have the means to solve our problems in the present. There are many reasons to be optimistic and hopeful.Co-founder, Environmental Media AssociationCriticizing the president during wartime is fine, as long as it\u0027s based on reality and facts.

You can\u0027t have it both ways.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027\"Is that shirt supposed to be funny?\" she asked motioning to my satirical \"Caucasians\" T-shirt. And then she said, \"I\u0027ll f*cking cut you.\" This is the part you don\u0027t really see in its full glory on the segment.Writer, producer, and member of the 1491s, a sketch comedy groupIf this bothers you -- as it should -- look. Think. Research. Donate if you can. Spread the word. Share. I don\u0027t want any other parent to know firsthand what pediatric cancer looks like.Blogger, Kissing The FrogOn Fox News a Muslim who killed a co-worker in Oklahoma and who remains in police custody represents a much bigger story than a suspected anti-government assassin who killed a cop and remains on the run, eluding hundreds of law enforcement officials while terrorizing a Pennsylvania community.Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaIf a condition, even Ebola, threatens your life, be courageous, be informed, and be prepared to make a decision that could help you survive.Practicing hematologist and medical oncologistThe Occupy Movement has returned and is resurrecting itself in Hong Kong.

Regardless of plot, cast or dialogue, the unsung hero of the autumnal movie is the cinematographer.Editor, bestmoviesbyfarr.comTo our law enforcement officers: You pledged to serve and protect the people -- not to the governmental framework who oppresses the people. You have blindly followed your unconstitutional orders. Shame on you.Advocate and human rights expert in Hong KongWhat must this past season have been like for a man with still so much life before him, hearing all those eulogies to his youth? \"Ballplayer\" is the only identity Jeter has ever known, and now, at an age when many are only getting started, he will have to redefine his life.Host, \u0027Dan Rather Presents\u0027Why is dietary self-control so difficult, even when we know full well what\u0027s at stake and what\u0027s right? It\u0027s not helpful at all to say simply that some people have more willpower. What\u0027s going on, at the most fundamental cognitive level, that leads to good and bad dietary decisions?Author, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027The answer lies in human psychology. And probably like the old observation about history, people who refuse to understand human psychology are doomed to be victims of psychological manipulation.Former FBI Special AgentIn my first marriage, which lasted 18 years, I had a hard time being seen naked. Especially in my child-bearing years, when my only purpose was to serve my children, to be their sustenance. My sexuality went right out the window.Dating Guru, Mom Butler, Wife Dominatrix, Slightly MustachioedAn inability to predict the lay of tomorrow\u0027s land may, in a way, be par for the course. If so, however, remind me: Why exactly are we supporting 17 versions of intelligence gathering to the tune of at least $68 billion a year?Editor, TomDispatch.comIt would seem that poetry is dying in the real world, only to be reborn into a kind of \"Invisible Golden Age\" online.American poet living in EnglandAs I saw during my time in venture capital, it\u0027s the little things that reveal what a company is all about at its core.Author and cofounder of Fuse CorpsUnlike many of the other contenders for top CEO, Musk is not just dedicated to wealth.

We\u0027ve lost many patients since opening the ETU almost two weeks ago, but tonight -- my very last night here -- it doesn\u0027t look like anyone\u0027s going to die.Assistant Professor of Emergency Medicine, Brown Medical SchoolGDP growth is less and less relevant to the wellbeing of most Americans. We should be paying less attention to growth and more to median household income.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027I sold a business for $10 million and then two years later I was dead broke because once again I forgot all about love.
