{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"United States Senator (Ret.)It is interesting to speculate how the partisan lines would divide had this same agreement been concluded during the George W. Bush years. Based on the history of the Cold War years, there would have been considerable support from the Democratic side and not the solid partisan resistance from Republicans now committed to blinkered opposition to anything achieved by the Obama Administration. This agreement to limit Iranian nuclear ambitions does not and could not solve all the complex problems represented by Iran in the Middle East any more than nuclear arms agreements with the Soviets solved all the problems they represented in the world. No plausible and persuasive argument has yet been offered as to why we and our allies would be better off without this agreement. Until it is offered, this agreement profoundly requires Congressional approval.Andy Cohen is messy. We know this. That said, he got too messy labeling 16-year-old actress Amandla Stenberg \"Jackhole of the Day\" on Sunday night\u0027s episode of Watch What Happens Live. What\u0027s worse, Laverne Cox and Andre Leon Talley, two Black folk, sat there and let that slide.Author, \u0027Don\u0027t Waste Your Pretty\u0027In early June, the ACLU commissioned a nationwide poll of registered voters who are likely to vote in the 2016 presidential election. The results, released Wednesday, demonstrate that we have arrived at a bipartisan moment where majorities of Americans no longer believe our criminal justice system serves the common good.Director, ACLU Campaign for Smart JusticeScott Walker thought he was playing a deft game. But this week it blew up in spectacular fashion as Walker stepped on the Ben Carson third rail and blatantly implied gay men are predators who can\u0027t be trusted around children. You\u0027d think in 2015 this kind of blatant defamation would be banished from politics.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostExxonMobil no longer funds climate change deniers?! Is that right? Technically, perhaps, because practically no one can say with a straight face that global warming isn\u0027t happening anymore. Most, if not all, of the people who used to deny the reality of climate change have morphed into climate science deniers.Senior Writer, Union of Concerned ScientistsThese computational thinking skills are becoming more important as computers, algorithms and data become ubiquitous. Coding will also become more common, particularly with the growth in the use of visual programming languages, like Blockly, that remove the need to learn programming language syntax, and via custom blocks, can be used as an abstraction for many different applications.Journalism/English teacherThe \"security vs. liberty\" strawman argument remains the rhetorical weapon of choice for National Security State officials terrified by the spread of public encryption technologies. They argue that, absent some form of technological \"back door\" to break into private encrypted communications, federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies will be blinded, unable to fend off potential terrorist attacks here at home.Policy Analyst for Homeland Security and Civil Liberties, Cato InstituteI was put on this Earth to live the often fabulous -- though frequently maligned -- life of a homosexual. Sling your accusatory rhetoric at me all you want. But to use Bible verses to taint someone\u0027s existence, his very life, as a sin because he is attracted to someone of the same-sex is deplorable.Blogger, I Am Michael, Hear Me RohrerThose who oppose deals like this often proclaim a binary world of simple good and evil, which we don\u0027t have -- and believing so is a dangerous illusion.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersClearly, there is a deep conflict of interest between the Chamber\u0027s aggressiveness on tobacco and the interests of its health-related members. So why is the Chamber so brazenly pursuing the interests of Big Tobacco?Director, Public Citizen\u0027s Congress WatchWith a view geared towards only debt repayments, additional taxes have been levied to the battered Greek economy and even more are coming. Which raises the question: Who\u0027s afraid of Greek growth?Professor, University of PeloponneseAssistant Professor of Economic Theory and Policy, Panteion UniversityDonald Trump has turned out to be the perfect spokesperson for the GOP. He says the things they think but are, unlike him, too afraid to say in front of cameras and into microphones. One would think that comments like that would cost someone votes but instead, they\u0027ve only made him more popular with the right.Richard Zombeck is a freelance writer for hire and a contributor to www.nowitcounts.comThis week\u0027s historic agreement between the United States and Iran shows that diplomatic acumen combined with scientific prowess can still come together to help limit and delay the spread of nuclear weapons. Still, today\u0027s world remains exceedingly dangerous.Executive Director and Publisher of the Bulletin of the Atomic ScientistsThis will basically allow politicians in Wisconsin to accept unlimited, secret contributions with impunity, as long as the money is not used for ads that expressly say to vote for or against a candidate.Director of Research for Legal Progress, Center for American ProgressTo all the governors out there, follow the president\u0027s lead. Start robustly using your executive clemency powers to reduce your state\u0027s prison population. Release those non-violent offenders who don\u0027t need to be serving their entire natural lives in prison.Associate Professor of Justice StudiesBilly Graham\u0027s son is terrified that President Obama and a whole host of us have chucked out our Bibles in order to support marriage equality. This is laughable if it weren\u0027t so powerfully sad. Here\u0027s the thing, Franklin: You need to read your Bible better.Pastor of Christ Church: Portland, an open, active \u0026 inclusive faith community for God\u0027s glory \u0026 neighbor\u0027s good.I\u0027m glad that we had to hear each other\u0027s voices and have the nerve to ask each other things outright rather than hiding behind a cell phone screen, typing away. I\u0027m glad that we spent our first Christmas apart falling asleep on the phone with each other.Homeschooling, ballerina mommy of three with baby 4 on board, sharing her parenting adventure at Beyond MommyingIsn\u0027t it about time we reimagined what being old is? We can start with who we call \u0027elderly,\u0027 and maybe we could stop assuming that every 66-year-old is going to retire the very moment they reached full retirement age.Senior Writer/Columnist, The Huffington PostWhen a nonviolent offender spends a decade or more of their life behind bars because of mandatory minimum sentencing, no one benefits. When those who have paid their debt to society cannot find housing or a job, the entire economy suffers. When a generation of young Americans advance through our prison system instead of our school system, our nation is weaker for it.President, AFL-CIOI cannot in good conscience mourn my brother as a victim of genocide unless I similarly mourn all other victims of genocide, including the victims at Srebrenica.Professor of law and son of Holocaust survivorsThe Vienna agreement now offers Iran a unique opportunity to move towards the international community following decades of isolation and confrontation. It gives cause for hope that, beyond Vienna, Tehran\u0027s policy will no longer see only opponents but rather potential partners and win-win arrangements in the Middle East.German Foreign MinisterIt all made sense after that second conversation -- why I had been so sick a few days following that first brunch. I had initially chalked it up to just not feeling well and moved on, but now I knew that I had been glutened.New York University School of LawThree years ago, the United Nations issued a report predicting that the Gaza Strip would be uninhabitable by 2020. Thanks to Israel\u0027s recent attack, this warning appears to have arrived sooner than expected.Journalist and authorI think I\u0027ll listen to Taylor Swift each June from here on out to celebrate and commemorate what I saw at the concert -- and to remind myself what Pride is all about.Managing Partner, Collective ConscienceI am so sick of the scrutinizing of female athletes and whether or not they are feminine, whether they can be both feminine and athletic, and all the rest of that tired, sexist, clueless, despicable BS. Heads-up: Athleticism is not gendered.Educational psychologist, consultant, and author of Her Next ChapterWhile we value the decision of President Obama to support Rojava militarily against ISIL, the administration can do more. The United States must not abandon the people of Rojava for the interests of the regional states who are actually doing very little to fight ISIL.Co-chairman of the Democratic Union Party (PYD) in SyriaThe moment mainstream media respectfully recognizes, acknowledges and represents the source, purpose, and most importantly the people behind different cultures, rather than reduce it to just costumes or hot trends, is the moment we can begin to define \"cultural exchange.\"Cultural writer based in NYC.There are more solar workers than actors in California, according to Bureau of Labor numbers crunched by the Solar Foundation, which also counted more solar jobs in Texas than there are ranchers.Oscar-nominated actor, climate change activistAs much as Sex and The City wanted us to think it, New York isn\u0027t your boyfriend. And since it isn\u0027t your dumb boyfriend, it\u0027s free to be perfect -- and New York is perfect. I recently had two West Coasters say things like, \"New York is great, but all people do there is sit in bars and talk.\" Can you imagine anything better?Future NurseGreece\u0027s lack of status was an impediment to negotiations, but given Germany\u0027s immediately hostile stance, there may have been no other option available to Syriza than to behave like an outsider.WriterWhether it\u0027s for work or as part of your vacation, travel can be a great time to learn about a new place, try new things and enjoy a break from your usual schedule.
