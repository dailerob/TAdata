There are several ideologues submitting textbook critiques to the board and their reviews will factor into each book\u0027s overall score and likelihood of being approved by the school board. These ideologues could block the use of textbooks that teach the reality of climate change for the whole country\u0027s public school students. Climate science is being attacked by deniers who want to sow seeds of doubt as we try to educate our children about how our way of life -- including our fossil fuel habit -- is affecting God\u0027s earth through climate change.
