{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, the nation once again survived an onslaught of goblins and ghouls. I\u0027m talking of course about Wednesday\u0027s Republican debate. Candidates, campaigns, and RNC chair Reince Priebus all chided the moderators for not focusing on substance. I assume they are talking about substance like deporting 11 million people, taking health insurance away from 25 million Americans, or pursuing massive tax cuts for the rich. Perhaps they mean Trump\u0027s tax plan, which would cost $10 trillion over 10 years. Or maybe it\u0027s Carson\u0027s \"tithing\" tax plan that would pay for only 28 percent of estimated government spending. If \"substance\" means forcing candidates to account for the real world consequences of their proposals, then perhaps the candidates should be thankful for the absence of substance.
