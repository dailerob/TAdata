{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor of Law, UCLAToday, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a landmark case challenging the constitutionality of California\u0027s ban on gay marriage. The California case, brought by Supreme Court superstars Ted Olson and David Boies, was designed from the beginning to obtain a bold, revolutionary ruling by the justices declaring gay marriage a constitutional right. If Olson and Boies -- who famously went head-to-head in the notorious Bush v. Gore case -- win, it could mean that all bans on gay marriage, everywhere in the country, will be overturned. Gay and lesbian people from Beverly Hills to Bangor will finally enjoy an equal right to marry the person they love. Yet don\u0027t count on a game-changing decision too quickly. It\u0027s more likely that Olson and Boies\u0027 blockbuster will end with a whimper.Read Post | Comments (639)Sir Ken Robinson, 12/07/12Consultant; Author, \u0027The Element: How Finding Your Passion Changes Everything\u0027We\u0027re all born with deep natural capacities for creativity, and systems of mass education tend to suppress them. It is increasingly urgent to cultivate these capacities and to rethink the dominant approaches to education to make sure that we do.Read Post | Comments (308)Marlo Thomas, 12/07/12Award-winning actress, author and activistWe all carry inside of us our collective Christmases and Hanukkahs -- the sight of twinkling lights and glowing candles, the sound of caroling and chanted prayers, the smell of pine trees and freshly fried latkes -- and it all comes rushing back to us every December.Read Post | Comments (31)Arianna Huffington, 12/07/12In this week\u0027s Huffington, John Rudolf puts the spotlight on crime-ridden Camden, New Jersey, where instead of improving the police department, local leaders plan to replace it entirely. And Michelangelo Signorile looks back at an article he wrote 20 years ago about being gay at The New York Times, and how the paper rose to a new level of journalistic integrity by ending its silence on gay issues.Read Post | CommentsEmma Jenner, 12/04/12Child development and behavioral specialistThe English are truly great at bringing up resilient, well-mannered, brave, and kind children.

The result is that in the name of balance, the press actually put its thumb on the scale and prevented a true reckoning.Read Post | Comments (275)Josh Silver, 12/07/12CEO, United RepublicFor those of us who care less about partisanship and more about what our elected officials actually do -- or fail to do -- once in office, the 2012 election portends a bleak future.Read Post | Comments (21)Neil Young, 12/06/12Activist and rock legendFor survival of the planet and our way of life as human beings, we need to drastically reduce our carbon output.

Hannah, 12/07/12Director of Media and Community Partnerships, GLAADTo call the media\u0027s silence on Sage Smith\u0027s story deafening would be an understatement. That someone\u0027s son or daughter, trans-identified or not, can go missing from their family for nearly 20 days and there be no national or even local outcry is more than enraging; it\u0027s terrifying.Read Post | CommentsMarian Wright Edelman, 12/07/12President, Children\u0027s Defense FundChildren who have to navigate the harsh reality of homelessness on top of poverty often fall through our already porous safety nets and disproportionately drop out of school and then, too often, drop into the prison pipeline.Read Post | CommentsJared Bernstein, 12/07/12Fmr.

Goodman, 12/07/12Counseling psychology Ph.D. studentStraight people benefit from gay rights. It\u0027s not a major reason to support LGBT rights (such rights stand on their own merits); it\u0027s just a fact.
