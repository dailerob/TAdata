{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOJohn McCain made a mistake Tuesday evening, which as far as I\u0027m concerned, disqualifies him from being president. It is so appalling and factually wrong that I\u0027m actually sitting here wondering who McCain\u0027s advisers are. It\u0027s a real misunderstanding of what has happened in Iraq over the past year. If we are going to have an Iraq-centric war on terror policy, he should at least understand what he is talking about.Read Post | CommentsBIORobert Scheer, 07.23.2008Both candidates are embracing, rather than challenging, the fundamental irrationality of Bush\u0027s \"war on terror,\" which substitutes hysteria for rational analysis in appraising the dangers the country faces.Read Post | Comments (22)BIORobert L. Borosage, 07.22.2008This fall, Americans will discover an inconvenient truth about McCain -- he wants you to lose your employer-based health care. He thinks you aren\u0027t sufficiently conscious about the cost, and you\u0027re using too much of it.Read Post | Comments (152)BIOJoseph A. Palermo, 07.22.2008McCain\u0027s belief that the surge \"won the war\" contradicts the substance of the \"status of force\" agreement the Bush administration has been trying to ram down the Iraqi government\u0027s throat.Read Post | CommentsBIOMarie Wilson, 07.23.2008Women have been disproportionately impacted by economic distress: they\u0027re the first ones to lose their jobs during cutbacks, and they\u0027re the primary caretakers for their families in cash-strapped times.Read Post | CommentsBIOJason Linkins, 07.23.2008When Katie Couric told Haaretz that \"The glory days of TV news are over,\" her words framed what looked like a lament, but her recent interview with Obama make them seem like a threat.Read Post | CommentsBIOLester Feder, 07.23.2008The whole point of McCain\u0027s rejected op-ed, published Tuesday in the New York Post, is that he doesn\u0027t think it is wise to offer the kind of Iraq statement that would satisfy the Times.Read Post | CommentsBIOEmma Gilbey Keller, 07.22.2008This morning, we women woke up to the terrific news that we have finally achieved professional parity with our male counterparts.Read Post | Comments (11)BIOCenk Uygur, 07.23.2008Everyone seems to assume that if we drill for oil in the US, we will get the oil and won\u0027t be dependent on foreign oil anymore. But we won\u0027t get anything, Exxon-Mobil will.Read Post | CommentsBIOHarold Pollack, 07.22.2008Morris and McGann slam the Obama health plan for its alleged generous coverage of undocumented immigrants. How can the Post print an op-ed whose core factual premise is transparently false?Read Post | CommentsBIONathaniel Bach, 07.21.2008Obama\u0027s fifty-state strategy is not about his winning these states in this election. It\u0027s about \"trickle up\" politics and grassroots efforts on a national scale, all of which will help sow the seeds of future Democratic majorities.Read Post | CommentsBIOAlex Pasternack, 07.23.2008After months of insisting on a non-politicized Olympics, pressure from international groups has advanced press and political freedoms in China.Read Post | CommentsBIOGreg Mitchell, 07.22.2008An ABC-TV outlet in Houston has video from a political fundraiser last week capturing some embarrassing/revealing moments after President Bush had asked cameras to be turned off.Read Post | Comments (471)Arianna Huffington, 07.21.2008Seth Grahame-Smith, 07.22.2008Robert Klein, 07.22.2008Lee Camp, 07.22.2008Earnest Harris, 07.22.2008William Bradley, 07.22.2008Mitchell Bard, 07.22.2008Huff TV, 07.22.2008Katie Halper, 07.22.2008Jason Linkins, 07.22.2008Paul Rieckhoff, 07.22.2008Andy Ostroy, 07.22.2008John McQuaid, 07.22.2008Major R.
