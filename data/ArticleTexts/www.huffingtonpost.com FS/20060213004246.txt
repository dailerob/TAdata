{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"From bbc.co.ukPulling out my slightly dusty Texas Rolodex, I\u0027ve begun making calls to some of my old friends -- and have been surprised by how many of them are more than eager to talk (and speculate) about what really happened this weekend at the Armstrong Ranch. READ MOREKarl Rove\u0027s Connection to the Cheney Shooting Rove\u0027s fingerprints are all over the handling of this story. And perhaps a bit of his DNA as well. READ MOREHappy Valentine\u0027s Day, Dick: Why the Press is Acting Like a Jilted Lover Cheney has been the political equivalent of a philandering husband, and the press has been the compliant and silently-suffering wife, willing to put up with being lied to and cheated on again and again and again and again.READ MOREI\u0027ll be discussing the Cheney shooting fallout tonight on CNN Showbiz Tonight (4:05 PT/7:05 ET) and Sunday morning on CNN\u0027s Reliable Sources (7 am PT/10 am ET).READ POST | comments (44)02.15.2006 Steve MartinVice President Dick Cheney, while hunting wild geese in the Rose Garden, accidentally shot President Bush twice, once in the heart and once in the head. \"I didn\u0027t really shoot the President twice,\" said Cheney. \"The second time I shot him, I was president.\"READ POST | comments (71)02.15.2006 Molly IvinsI am not trying to make a big deal out of a simple hunting accident for partisan purposes--just thought it was a good chance to pay tribute to old Harry, a thoroughly decent man.READ POST | comments (13)02.15.2006 Bob CescaVICE PRESIDENT CHENEY: So I ran up to Harry. I didn\u0027t run, actually. I kind of lurched. I like to lurch. Harry was conscious, happy, and joking. He was also unconscious, severely injured, and not talking.READ POST | comments02.15.2006 Adam McKayRoy from Monsanto, Jack from Dynacorp, Steve from Bechtel, Judge Scalia and myself all leveled our rifles at the bear while the handlers lured it into our rifle sight. But the bear had fallen asleep. \"I don\u0027t care,\" said Boon. \"I flew two hours in my G-4 to shoot some bear!\"READ POST | comments02.15.2006 Jane Hamsher1. If you were not in fact drunk as a skunk at the time you shot a 78 year-old man in the face, Dick, why did you go to so much trouble to get MSNBC to scrub Katharine Armstong\u0027s comments about alcohol at the hunt out of their article?READ POST | comments (27)02.15.2006 Eugene JareckiNow I don\u0027t know Mr. Whittington. But I have never laughed at anyone being shot in my life before. Let alone someone older than my parents. So what is it about Dick Cheney that brings out the worst in us?READ POST | comments (36)02.15.2006 Jonah PerettiIn less than 24 hours, a late entry called Quail Hunting with Dick Cheney rocketed to the top of the Contagious Festival standings. It is very exciting to see the Festival being used for rapid, satirical responses to breaking news.READ POST | comments02.15.2006 Alan DershowitzA simple cost/benefit analysis suggests that Cheney must have believed that there was more to be gained than lost by a 14 hour delay that would eventually be made public. It is likely, therefore, that something happened during that 14 hour period which was worth the negative costs of the delay.READ POST | comments (92)02.15.2006 Michael SmerconishIt\u0027s safe to say that the random violence that Richard Bruce Cheney committed last weekend may forever change his life, his wife\u0027s life, and let\u0027s not forget, the life of his daughter, Mary, who, according to Democrat sources, is a lesbian.READ POST | comments (13)02.15.2006 RJ EskowThe real story is already emerging, if you\u0027re willing to do a little digging. Cheney and Whittington went hunting with two women (not their wives), there was some drinking, and Whittington wound up shot. Neither the press nor law enforcement seems inclined to investigate.READ POST | comments (71)02.15.2006 Jerry and Joe LongHere are a few random observations as we await Cheney going on Dr. Phil to tearfully confess how he likes to booze it up and hunt man.READ POST | comments (11)02.15.2006 Frank DwyerIn the interests of national security, does the President of the United States have the legal authority to authorize the shooting of Harry Whittington? The American people need to know.READ POST | comments (11)02.15.2006 Ari MelberThe next time you hear this scandal is not receiving the perfectly proportional amount of coverage it deserves, don\u0027t sweat it. Cheney is finally in a corner for something, and he deserves every minute of it.READ POST | comments (22)02.15.2006 Bill MaherI don\u0027t care about the Olympics. It\u0027s like watching gym. Off the top of my head, I can only think of one thing more insipid than the Olympics and that\u0027s the Winter Olympics.READ POST | comments (59)02.14.2006 Nora EphronThis episode has unleashed an astonishing epidemic of coming-out-of-the-closet among liberals-who-have-fired-guns. I want to put myself squarely among them. What\u0027s more, I used to teach riflery at Camp Tocaloma.READ POST | comments (67)02.15.2006 Bob CescaSirius radio\u0027s Alex Bennett just broke a rumor that the delay in reporting the news that Cheney shot an old man in the heart was due to an effort to hide or spin Cheney\u0027s female companion.READ POST | comments (193)02.14.2006 Harry ShearerThe Republicans now know what it felt like when the Monica story erupted. Like this in-your-face shooting, that one embodied a cartoon version of what \"everyone\" in Washington already knew.READ POST | comments (42)02.15.2006 Robert ScheerCondoleezza Rice is someone I knew to be a very bright scholar when we were both fellows in Stanford University\u0027s arms-control seminar. Yes, we differed on occasion, but I never had cause to doubt her ability to reason. Now, I do.READ POST | comments (51)02.14.2006 Stephen KausThe right-wing blogs appear not to have gotten the White House memo \"that the best way to deal with Vice President Dick Cheney\u0027s shooting accident is to joke about it.\"READ POST | comments (21)02.14.2006 James MooreThere was no reason to delay reporting the incident to authorities unless Cheney was worried about a blood alcohol test. If the local police showed up and Cheney had booze on his breath, we would be talking today about something more than jokes on The Daily Show.READ POST | comments (50)From cnn.comAP/Shakil AdilFrom avaxhome.ruAP/Mike FuentesLogin to Huffington Post  |  Make Huff Post your Home Page  |  RSS/XML  |  Sitemap  |  Advertising  |  JobsCopyright 2005 © HuffingtonPost.com, LLC   |  User Agreement  |  Privacy  |  Comment Policy  |  Powered by MovableType","h1":"Cheney Talks: “I\u0027ve Shot My Friend”...",".title":"","h2":"A (Shotgun) Blast from My GOP PastKarl Rove\u0027s Connection to the Cheney ShootingDick Cheney WatchWhile You Were Chuckling at DickTranscript: Brit Hume\u0027s Interview with Dick CheneyYoohoo!
