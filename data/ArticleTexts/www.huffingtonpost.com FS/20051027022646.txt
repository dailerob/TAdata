{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AP Photo/Eric GayWith Plamegate dominating the day, the table is set for the Democratic Party to seize the moment. So how have the Democrats reacted? You be the grand jury (Warning: have some Xanax or other suitable anti-depressant handy): Exhibit A is the story NPR ran on Tuesday in which Senate Dems were asked if they regretted their votes to authorize the war in Iraq. Hillary Clinton refused to even address the question, saying: “I really can’t talk about this on the fly, it’s too important”. As with everything Hillary says and does these days, you could hear her and her consultants doing the math: Expressing regret \u003d too soft for the Oval Office...READ POST | comments (48)10.26.2005 Lawrence O\u0027DonnellToday\u0027s Post says that the grand jury has to unanimously agree to return indictments. HuffPo readers have known since last week that it takes only a majority of grand jurors to indict--12 of 23.READ POST | comments (37)10.26.2005 Ari EmanuelI caught the president’s speech yesterday. A tired reprise of the same talking points we’ve heard so many times -- and which, with each passing day (and each new death in Iraq), seem more and more detached from reality.READ POST | comments (13)10.26.2005 Trey EllisRosa Parks died the other day of natural causes at the age of 92. Stanley “Tookie” Williams, 51 and the co-founder of the Crips, is scheduled to die on December 13th at the hands of the state of California.READ POST | comments10.26.2005 Eric BoehlertBy my tally, since the Plame story broke two years ago that\u0027s nearly 900 broadcasts between ABC, CBS and NBC\u0027s signature long form news programs, and exactly three reports on the leak investigation.READ POST | comments (15)10.26.2005 Bob CescaThe Plumbers had to prop the garage entrance in order to burglarize the DNC. The neocon cabal had to smear the unfriendlies in the lead-up to Iraq in order to attain their prize.READ POST | comments (19)10.26.2005 Paul RieckhoffThe debate about the war is made up of false choices in the country today. Staying the course is not an option, nor is an immediate pullout.READ POST | comments (19)10.26.2005 Jeralyn MerrittFitzgerald may decide to give Rove a complete pass if he has cooperated to significant extent, turning on Libby and others in Cheney\u0027s office, the White House Iraq Group and perhaps the State or Defense Departments.READ POST | comments (22)10.26.2005 Jane HamsherThey\u0027ve tried to argue that this was all Cheney\u0027s doing, but I don\u0027t buy it. This wasn\u0027t the kind of thing Rove needed to \"protect\" Junior from. It\u0027s the kind of dirty, junior high politics that former \"loyalty enforcer\" Dubya delights in.READ POST | comments (37)10.26.2005 Jay GordonWho was the Chairman of Board of Gilead until he resigned to join the Bush Administration?

After so many false starts on this, I wonder if the real John Kerry will show up today.READ POST | comments (22)10.25.2005 William E. Jackson Jr.Amazingly, in an e-mail to Calame late Sunday night, Miller touted her alleged permission to be privy to ”intelligence sources and methods.” This was the security clearance that never was; a canard.READ POST | comments (19)10.25.2005 Patt MorrisonA spokesman for the U.S. command called the 2,000 figure an \"artificial mark on the wall.\" We put marks on the wall to remember how tall our children were, and how tall they have become. The marks always get higher, never lower. The death toll will only grow.READ POST | comments (13)10.26.2005 Mark KleimanKarl Rove just took two giant steps closer to a prison cell.READ POST | comments (13)10.25.2005 James MooreNo matter what happens, we need to remember this is not simply about the deceptiveness of Karl Rove and the Bush cabal. Patrick Fitzgerald\u0027s investigation is primarily about bringing justice to the fallen soldiers of America.READ POST | comments10.25.2005 RJ EskowCheney\u0027s new posture can be summed up as \"I Am Not a Crook: A Liar, Yes.
