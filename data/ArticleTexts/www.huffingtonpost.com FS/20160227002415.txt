{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Global Editorial DirectorIn “The Wizard of Oz,” Dorothy’s pet dog, Toto, pulls back a curtain to reveal the mortal mountebank at the pathetic heart of a machine built on intimidation and fear. In the Houston GOP debate on Thursday, a terrier-like Sen. Marco Rubio played Toto, unsettling Donald Trump and -- more importantly -- dramatizing an enduring truth about political leaders: Their greatest strength is also their greatest vulnerability. The turning point wasn\u0027t the debate, but three things that preceded it. Former Gov. Mitt Romney demanded that Trump reveal his taxes for recent years; Bloomberg probed into the spotty records of Trump\u0027s global deals; and The New York Times looked at how Trump staffs his Mar-a-Lago club with foreign workers on temporary visas. Taken together, the three opened gaping holes in Trump\u0027s claim to be a model of America-first, globally winning business success.Heroin addiction has ruined our family. The day my 15-year-old son, Brendan, took his first hit, he changed my life. Yes, not just his, but mine too. And not just mine, everyone who loved him.Author and real estate agentAuthor of \"What\u0027s Left of Us: A Memoir of Addiction\"Just as the progress of the first Reconstruction was followed by decades of retrenchment and reversal, many of the formidable threats millions of poor children and families -- of all races, but especially children of color -- face today are very dangerous steps backwards.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundIt is time to admit that the word \"white\" is wiping out the word \"evangelical.\"Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersWe remember Trayvon on this day because his death should serve as a daily reminder of the very real work left undone. His memory serves as our invitation to help fix a broken system. It will become better when we all become involvedDirector of Communications \u0026 Media Relations for the Campaign For Youth JusticeWhat sets McConnell apart is that his motives aren\u0027t really ideological but so baldly about holding onto personal power. His opposition to Obama\u0027s naming of a Scalia replacement puts the majority leader in solid with the far-right Republicans who have threatened his job security.Senior writer, BillMoyers.com. Former senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.Bernie\u0027s history was my starting point in learning more about him, but what he\u0027s pushing for now is what clinched my decision to switch my endorsement for president from Hillary Clinton to him. There are three specific policy reasons I support him.State senator and leading progressive in GAThe debates are about issues only in passing. They\u0027re mainly about show, and \"The Donald\" knows how to put on a show.Writer, Professor, Retired Lt. Colonel, Air ForceDecency matters to you. We take note of the person who pays their debts. We appreciate the physician who takes time to listen. We applaud decency. We teach decency. We seek to develop decency. Decency matters, right? Then why isn\u0027t decency doing better in the presidential race?Pastor in San Antonio and best-selling author of 32 booksMy introduction to adulthood happened the day after I turned 18. I was standing at a food cart with two other hijab-wearing females and one of their brothersStudent at Johns Hopkins UniversityLet\u0027s consider these questions: Who are your Black leaders? What does leadership look like to you? How can educators, parents, political representatives, and other concerned individuals support the future generation of Black leaders?Associate Professor of Africana Studies at Cornell UniversityThe shibboleths that have underpinned GOP strategy for a quarter century -- the rules set forth by Grover Norquist -- are no longer germane to GOP voters whose incomes have been stagnant for two decades or more. Instead, those voters have turned to the economic populism and nativism of Donald Trump.President, Fiscal Strategies GroupThere is nothing that feels more isolating than having to watch your nine-year-old daughter hold back tears of pain as she crawls through barbed wire to get to safety. Close your eyes and imagine what it feels like to not know whether loved ones are still alive. As Syrians, we can tell you that all this was never our norm.Global mental health advocate, Syrian native, psychological trauma research specialist, refugee aid workerJournalist; FixerDon\u0027t worry about diversity in your work, if you\u0027re Latino. I didn\u0027t set out to address diversity -- a word that makes me cringe, because it implies that the \"standard\" is white and everything else is \"non-white\" (another word establishing white as the standard -- at the center).Emmy-nominated narrator on the CW\u0027s Jane the Virgin and voice of several networks\u0027 on-air promos, including HBO, Showtime, Spike, and CNN.One of the lessons from Flint is that austerity -- i.e., reducing government deficits by any means except raising taxes -- has real consequences, especially for low-income families. Government didn\u0027t cause the crisis -- government run like a business did.Executive Director, In the Public InterestThis sense of vulnerability to perceived anti-white racism is hard to square with reality. In Hollywood, two straight years of complete exclusion of people of color in the acting categories would seem to make an undeniable case that the system is unfair to people of color, not whites.Professor of Law at UC Berkeley LawA robust defense against terrorism and belligerent adversaries is clearly crucial, but U.S. military strategy can\u0027t afford to be soft against the greatest threat of all: accidental nuclear war.MIT physicist, author of \"Our Mathematical Universe\"The last time I checked, no one in the U.S. is being punished for what they believe or for expressing that belief. So what\u0027s the fuss about? It\u0027s not a concern that people can\u0027t express their own beliefs. No, it seems to be a concern that people will not have the license to impose their beliefs on others.President, Center for Inquiry; Author of The Necessity of SecularismAs a father, my mind is spinning. I\u0027m thinking about being 12 years old and hearing the news of Columbine -- being shocked at this historic atrocity and wondering how this could ever happen. And, I am thinking about how my son will grow up with this scene as a normal state of living.Award-winning educator, blogger and fatherI don\u0027t know about the rest of you women, but I\u0027m pretty sick of hearing those words in general. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s funny or cute to call my girlfriends \"sluts,\" \"whores\" or \"bitches.\" I think it\u0027s degrading, dehumanizing, and to be honest, it downright pisses me off.Blogger at Inspiration Indulgence (inspirationindulgence.com), grad studentI sincerely do not want the length of my filibuster to be highlighted, or to be praised for setting a record. I want to know if I represented the people\u0027s desires on the podium.South Korean lawmakerThose in power, even when the power is on a side I support, will support actions that maintain power. The idea of an \"establishment\" in the women\u0027s movement, in the black and Hispanic communities, in the \"liberal media,\" in the Left in general, is not one we typically think of. But that establishment is very real.Film Producer, Director \u0026 Writer, Talent ManagerBefriending Muslims while attacking Islam is no way to make friends with Muslims. The attitude that \"Muslims are good people, but that which makes them Muslim is evil\" is averse to creating bonds of community between Muslims and non-Muslims in a multi-religious America.Lecturer of ReligionA game-changing \"solar tree\" public art initiative launched by the 100 Grannies for a Livable Future has galvanized a groundswell of support for a more community-based, inclusive and environmentally focused alternative that could serve as a public art model for other American cities.Author of \"Damnatio Memoriae: A Play, Una Commedia,\" www.jeffbiggers.comThe Democratic primary this Saturday in South Carolina is one where African-American voters should especially follow the advice of the legendary labor civil rights leader A. Phillip Randolph. He reminded us in the 20th century that Negroes had no permanent friends or permanent enemies, only \"permanent interests.\"If you\u0027re tired of hearing about women being harassed, tired of us sharing our stories about it, maybe that\u0027s because you\u0027ve been ignoring it. And we don\u0027t believe that you should have that luxury anymore, either.WriterIf you are trying to be a certain kind of mom to please society or your own mother, stop. Be true to yourself, love your child and do your very best, because I\u0027ve come to realize that\u0027s the secret to being the best kind of mother.Writer. AprilMcCormick.comIt\u0027s as if someone in a galaxy far, far away rang a loud bell. Could it be a signal from aliens trying to get in touch? Or is it something hitherto unknown, but still completely natural?Senior Astronomer, SETI Institute\"I loved being able to write about Neil Young for Rolling Stone, he was one of the artists I was able to follow through the years.\"Trafficbeat Entertainment, Music Biz VetIt\u0027s almost that time of year again, when, for three weeks, Houston, Texas becomes a mecca of all things rodeo. A beloved event in the local community since the 1930s, it is without a doubt one of the largest live entertainment and livestock exhibition events in the worldColumnist and author of \u0027Open: Love, Sex, and Life in an Open Marriage\u0027 and \u0027O Wow! Discovering Your Ultimate Orgasm\u0027While the Hindu ultra-nationalists went dormant for a while, the dream of a Hindu Rashtra, or Hindu Nation, was not abandoned. With the ascension of Modi to power, some believe that India can, at last, emerge as a Hindu nation. It remains to be seen if India\u0027s democracy can withstand the religious and fascist forces that seem to now reign supreme.Visiting Researcher, Boston University School of TheologyGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
