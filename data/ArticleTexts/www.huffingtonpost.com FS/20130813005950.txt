{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Mark GongloffChief financial writer, The Huffington PostAs usual, it does not pay to be one of the little guys in banking. U.S. authorities are reportedly hot on the trail of a couple of former JPMorgan Chase employees for their roles in the bank\u0027s \"London Whale\" trading debacle. The bankers were very near the bottom of the JPMorgan Chase totem pole. This news comes hot on the heels of the trial of Fabrice \"Fabulous Fab\" Tourre, the low-level Goldman Sachs cog who was found liable for crisis-era fraud, while the rest of the firm got off without having to admit or deny wrongdoing. And Fab is the only person who has been found liable for any crisis-era fraud so far. With each of these cases, it looks more like the government is happy to play tough with Wall Street minions, while the biggest players get away with fines and wrist slaps.Comments (71)Sen. Bernie Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth WarrenThe next Fed chair will have an opportunity to get our economy back on track and to help rebuild America\u0027s middle class. But that will require the right temperament and a willingness to take on Wall Street CEOs when necessary.Comments (853)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkParents and grandparents in this city are tired of having to warn their children about both criminals and the police. Do we want to see crime reduced? Absolutely, because they are doing it to us. But don\u0027t criminalize us at the same time.Comments (110)Maureen RyanTV critic, The Huffington PostWhen a great show enters its home stretch, it\u0027s impossible not to be nervous about the ending, but Breaking Bad reminds me of The Shield, in that it seems to work harder to satisfy and to earn every single moment and plot twist the closer it gets to the end.Comments (313)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Why is there more anger, vituperation, and political polarization now than even during Joe McCarthy\u0027s anti-communist witch hunts of the 1950s, the tempestuous struggle for civil rights in the 1960s, the divisive Vietnam war, or the Watergate scandal?Comments (359)Jan SchakowskyMember of Congress, 9th District of IllinoisAdd up all the voters that the Republicans have done their best to reject, and I refuse to believe that there are enough \"safe\" districts for them to maintain control of the House. I see danger for Republicans in 2014.Comments (332)Lisa ParkinSocial Media Consultant, YA Book BloggerNothing against the youth of today, but... aren\u0027t there some adults with real world experience who could, you know, jump in with the whole saving humanity thing?CommentsRussell SimmonsFounder, GlobalGrind.comThe time has come to end the so-called \"War on Drugs.\" Forty years of a failed war has destroyed communities and families all across our land. Hard earned tax-payer dollars have been wasted on ineffective policies that have resulted in over-incarceration.Comments (59)Raymond J. LearsyAuthor, \u0027Ruminations on the Distortion of Oil Prices and Crony Capitalism\u0027Hello Congress, Federal Reserve, Commodities Futures Trading Commission, Federal Trade Commission, Department of Justice, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, is anybody listening? Or do the Big Boys just get to play while we pay and pay!?Comments (179)Wes HurleyFilmmaker, \u0027Waxie Moon\u0027 and \u0027Fallen Jewel\u0027Realizing I was gay in Russia felt like a terminal disease diagnosis. There I was, a secret pedik, one of the monsters I\u0027d heard about so much yet knew so little about. Convinced that I was the only real gay person in Russia, I felt completely alienated from the human race.Comments (248)Jenni SchaeferSpeaker, Singer and Author of Almost Anorexic (released by Harvard Health Publications \u0026 Hazelden in July 2013); Goodbye Ed, Hello Me; Life Without EdOn planes and at parties, Dr. Thomas and I are often asked, \"How can I become almost anorexic?\", as if engaging in eating disorder symptoms at an average or above-average body weight is benign or even desirable.Comments (13)Doug BandowSenior Fellow, the Cato InstituteU.S. policy in Egypt has been a disaster. Now the short-lived democratic revolution has been replaced by military rule with a meaningless civilian veneer. Washington should cut off foreign aid and disengage.CommentsRobert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Do you think the damage from the pending bankruptcy of the city of Detroit will be limited to Detroit? Think again.Comments (1,048)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarIn my work as a research psychologist currently studying women in the workplace, I hear women describe this sort of near-obsessive commitment to work with increasing frequency. For many, it\u0027s how they develop feelings of self worth. This can be both empowering and dangerous.Comments (96)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027The news in the last couple of weeks has had endless references to two people who we have been repeatedly told are brilliant: Larry Summers and Jeff Bezos. The paeans to the genius of both men say a great deal about the quality of public debate in elite circles.CommentsJohn PavleyCTO @ The Huffington Post, BloggerIf you\u0027re a regular reader of the Huffington Post you might not have given much thought to the technology behind the news articles that you read, share and comment upon on our site. Since 2005 the tech team at HuffPost has been working hand-in-glove with our editors to create the ultimate digital content delivery system.Comments (23)Kathleen ReardonProfessor, USC Marshall School; Author, \u0027The Secret Handshake\u0027 and \u0027Shadow Campus\u0027Many people have told me they would love to write a novel. Why then have so many of them not done so?CommentsArt Markman, Ph.D.Executive Editor, Cognitive Science; Psychology and Marketing Professor, UT Austin; Director, the Program in the Human Dimensions of OrganizationsWhen you watch a basketball game, a player will make a couple of shots, and the announcers will decide that player is \"on fire\" and that he ought to take the team\u0027s next shot. Paradoxically, though, this confidence has a cost.CommentsKatie HurleyChild and Adolescent Psychotherapist, Parenting ExpertLife is far too scripted today. Plans are made. Classes are attended. Craft projects are intended to mimic those found on Pinterest. Gone are the days of free play and creating something out of nothing. Many kids today are simply following a script.Comments (31)Sean McElweeWriterIf Priebus wants to marginalize his increasingly out-of-touch party, who are we to stop him? I say, go further! If NBC or CNN runs these documentaries, no Republican candidate should ever debate or appear on their stations.Comments (12)Vivian Diller, Ph.D.Psychologist and author, \u0027Face It\u0027I\u0027m frequently asked about the online dating process, an increasingly popular means by which relationships start. Many report that online photos play a key role in getting the process started. Whether it\u0027s visual chemistry or love at first sight, your photo says a lot about you.CommentsBritChick ParisBritish girl living the Parisian life with all its highs and lowsNo one is safe anymore from this modern day disease of self-doubt and at times, loathing. It is high time we put a stop to all of this. I am not sure how, but I know that teens need our help.CommentsKevin BurrowsFood stylist and former Broadway performerLast Friday I came across a feature entitled \"\u0027\u0027Til There Was You\u0027: Broadway\u0027s Best Showmances,\" a collection of stories of 18 Broadway couples who fell in love while performing in or working on the same show. Of the couples depicted, not one of them was a same-sex couple. How could this be?Comments (50)William K. BlackAssoc. Professor, Univ. of Missouri, Kansas City; Sr. regulator during S\u0026L debacleI know that the public won\u0027t find it strange that elite Wall Street lawyers could not muster a single hero while the appraisers produced tens of thousands. The public does not expect much from Wall Street lawyers.Comments (29)Elizabeth HawksworthWriter and bloggerParents often feel very alone. And most of the time, childless people don\u0027t get it, because we\u0027re not in it.Comments (360)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorIf economists add so little value to markets, why do markets pay economists so much for their advice?Comments (59)Leighton WoodhouseCo-founder, DogParkMedia.comPresident Obama\u0027s performance Friday was even less persuasive than his pretense of holding Wall Street accountable for the crimes that led to the economic meltdown.Comments (165)Sophie KitsonHuman Resources and Talent professionalMore people today are interested in who they are, their values and making a difference than in making a promotion. More people today won\u0027t be loyal to a company; they will be loyal to an ideal.CommentsLeo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersLast month, McDonald\u0027s gave its workers a little gift -- a budget purporting to show how to survive on the starvation wages the burger behemoth pays. The bizarre financial plan made millionaire McDonald\u0027s CEO Don Thompson look like a real clown.Comments (431)Dan GlickmanVice President of the Aspen Institute and Senior Fellow at the Bipartisan Policy CenterRaising large sums of money is clearly one of the ways in which freshmen legislators can scare off potential challengers and prove their value to their party leadership. But this system allows wealthy interests to advance their own agenda.CommentsMeredith BodgasBlogger, MeritalBliss.comAnd you WILL get an IM from your mom wanting to know about the flight, the food, and pretty much everything else to ensure her that you\u0027re safe and happy. No matter how much you love your mother, nothing kills the mood faster than speaking to a blood relative.CommentsKelsey Dallas, 2013.12.08Jay Scott, 2013.12.08John Feffer, 2013.12.08Melissa Carter, 2013.12.08John Friedman, 2013.12.08Kevin Childs, 2013.12.08Michael Berkowitz, 2013.12.08Natasha Ashton, 2013.12.08Nancy Berk, Ph.D., 2013.12.08Udoka Okafor, 2013.12.08Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"VOTING RIGHTS WHACKED",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
