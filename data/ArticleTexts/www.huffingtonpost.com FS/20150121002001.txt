{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanySince December, Congress has twice passed measures to weaken regulations in the Dodd-Frank financial law that are intended to reduce the risk of another financial meltdown. In the last election cycle, Wall Street banks and financial interests spent over $1.2 billion on lobbying and campaign contributions, according to Americans for Financial Reform. Their spending strategy appears to be working. Just this week, the House passed further legislation that would delay by two years some key provisions of Dodd-Frank. \"[Banks] want to be able to do things their way, and that\u0027s very dangerous,\" MIT economist Simon Johnson tells me. \"\u0027Here we go again\u0027 -- I think that\u0027s exactly the motto, or the bumper sticker, for this Congress. It\u0027s crazy, it\u0027s unconscionable, but that is the reality.\"Despite its massive scale and scope, this secret global war across much of the planet is unknown to most Americans. Unlike the December debacle in Yemen, the vast majority of special ops missions remain completely in the shadows, hidden from external oversight or press scrutiny.Managing Editor, TomDispatch.comThe adoption of the IMF reforms by the United States Congress would send a long overdue signal to rapidly growing emerging economies that the world counts on their voices, and their resources, to find global solutions to global problems.Managing Director, IMFImmediately after he was inaugurated six years ago today, President Obama started passing measures to help revive the economy -- over Republican opposition: the Recovery Act, the auto rescue, and significant investments in our education system. His opponents and their allies predicted that his policies would lead to further economic disaster, but they were wrong.U.S. Representative for New York\u0027s 12th District; Ranking Democrat, Joint Economic CommitteeAs Majority Leader McConnell wields greater power than he has ever held in his life, some hack pundits predict that such awesome power will have a moderating influence on him. Don\u0027t count on it. People who strive for power the way McConnell has done throughout his career cannot be trusted to \"moderate\" themselves.Professor, historian, authorGiven that there is unquestionably far to go when it comes to fair housing opportunities and conditions, the Supreme Court shouldn\u0027t dishonor Dr. King\u0027s memory by removing one of the tools we have used to build bridges from the \"islands of despair\" of racialized poverty and segregation that Dr. King so powerfully decried.Chief Counsel, Constitutional Accountability CenterThe Republican establishment\u0027s leading presidential hopefuls know the current upbeat economy isn\u0027t trickling down to most Americans. But they\u0027ve got a whopping credibility problem, starting with trickle-down economics.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Either Obama will be the president whose initiatives to address income inequality and wage stagnation helped rebuild America\u0027s middle class, or he will prioritize a trade agenda that will offshore more good-paying jobs, destroy what is left of the American manufacturing sector, increase income inequality and speed the demise of America\u0027s middle class.Director, Public Citizen\u0027s Global Trade WatchRepublican leaders have chosen recently elected Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) to deliver the party\u0027s response to President Obama\u0027s State of the Union address. Ernst is a veteran who grew up on an Iowa farm. She is also a pistol-packing, anti-Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), anti-Clean Water Act politician.Director, NRDC Action FundJust say no to annual testing. No high-performing nation does it, and neither should we. We are the most over-tested nation in the world, and it\u0027s time to encourage children to sing, dance, play instruments, write poetry, imagine stories, create videos, make science projects, write history papers, and discover the joy of learning.Research Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027If we define gun violence as using a gun to end a human life, the FBI is telling us that less than 10 percent of those fatalities would be eliminated if we got rid of all violent crime.Mike the Gun GuyWhile avowed critics of social engineering at home, most conservatives believe the U.S. government can remake foreign societies abroad. It\u0027s a dangerous delusion. In pursuit of their interventionist fantasies, they are prepared to waste scarce financial resources, entangle the U.S. in foreign quarrels, and risk war with nuclear-armed powers.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteWe need to find a way to prepare mothers for the possibility that they may struggle, and that it doesn\u0027t make them bad mothers.Mother, freelance writer, and music therapistWe have so much to be grateful for in 2015, but we are not finished. Together we must break the barriers remaining that result in a second-class citizen status, and we must continue to fight until all military families are treated equally.Tracey Hepner-SmithAmericans, who increasingly oppose costly conflict, may come to recognize that the U.S. would be better off with a Cuba and an Iran (without nuclear weapons) as functioning members of the international community.Director of The Iran Project; former American Ambassador to Venezuela and CzechoslovakiaFormer U.S. Ambassador to Jordan, Nigeria, El Salvador, Israel, India, Russia and the UNLiterary history was made today with the publication of the first-ever book by a still-imprisoned Guantánamo detainee. Mohamedou Ould Slahi\u0027s Guantánamo Diary was finally published with some redactions after years of litigation to declassify it.Communications strategist at the ACLUUndoubtedly timed to the opening of the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, a new report by Oxfam says the richest 1 percent of people in the world will have a majority of the wealth on the planet next year. The report is a perfect preamble to the Davos meeting.Advisor to government and business leaders; Author, The Digital Economy, 20th Anniversary EditionIn the five years since the Supreme Court decided Citizens United, the decision\u0027s impact is clear. Average American\u0027s voices are being drowned out by the outpouring of money from mega-donors and undercut by undisclosed spending by dark money groups.Vice President for Legal Progress, Center for American ProgressThe main theme of a national election can turn on a dime, due to a major world event or even due to the public\u0027s fascination with one unforeseen minor topic. But, at least for the time being, the 2016 election seems to be shaping up as a race centered on economic populism.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comThat word is admittedly a scary one. Most civilized, sane people don\u0027t want to be called homophobic. It doesn\u0027t mean that you\u0027re murdering gay people. It doesn\u0027t even mean that you\u0027re a homophobe. But...Executive Editor, HuffPost Gay VoicesThe House Democratic Party leadership made a remarkable step forward last week in putting out a proposal for a financial transactions tax (FTT).Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027While protecting and defending our right to abortion services we must also support the choices of women who want to expand their families. Paid family leave is a natural extension of the choice movement because our ultimate goal is to support women, no matter their choice.Women\u0027s rights advocate. Writer. Mother. Feminist.Obama also wants an excise tax on large banks and he is calling on Congress to pass a law giving all workers seven days of annual sick leave. All this amounts to a salutary whiff of class warfare, of the sort that identifies the president with most Americans, against the one percent. And there will probably be a few more surprises in the actual address that have not yet been leaked.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027If Dr. King proved anything, it\u0027s that service isn\u0027t a series of discrete acts -- it\u0027s a way of life.First Lady of New York CityI like seeing sweat drip, heart rates elevated, and heavy breathing. What I don\u0027t like is the trend toward thinking we need to beat down our bodies until they hurt. Working out until you can\u0027t move is not a badge of honor.National fitness expert, speaker, contributor to Prevention magazine, author of several books and fitness DVDsEven though all the research tells us that money in and of itself won\u0027t bring us meaning, we still are, understandably, lured to wealth. We need to inject more of our passions into everyday life -- to create the sparks that give us more meaning. Only then can we truly author our own lives.Science writer and public information officer, OSF, Cognitive Neuroscience SocietyOver 140 organizations and millions of activists have banded together to counteract the Supreme Court\u0027s nefarious slash-and-burn of campaign finance restrictions, implemented to safeguard our democratic process from becoming a plutocracy where the wealthy few call all the shots.Co-Founder, Ben \u0026 Jerry\u0027s Ice Cream and Head Stamper, StampStampede.orgWith the Sterling trial, the CIA is airing soiled threads of its dirty laundry as never before in open court. The agency seems virtually obsessed with trying to refute the negative portrayal of Operation Merlin in James Risen\u0027s 2006 book, State of War.Author, \u0027War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death\u0027In recent decades, economic growth has powerfully benefited Wall Street while leaving much of Main Street behind. The plan that President Obama unveiled today would take large, important steps to help redress part of the imbalance and make prosperity more broadly shared.Founder and President, Center on Budget \u0026 Policy PrioritiesOn the one hand, major economies are benefiting from the decline in the price of oil. On the other, in many parts of the world, lower long-run prospects adversely affect demand, resulting in a strong undertow.Economic Counsellor and Director of the Research Department, International Monetary FundIt\u0027s more convenient to wrap your understanding around a bad guy. I think some people also want to know concrete reasons why, so that they can avoid making those mistakes themselves. But relationships are messy, even on good days. It stands to reason then that uncoupling is just a veritable nightmare.Psychotherapist, writer, single mother of twoGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"THE PROGRESSIVE PUSH",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
