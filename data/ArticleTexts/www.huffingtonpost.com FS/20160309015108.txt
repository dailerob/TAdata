His face adorns the $10 bill. If only his thoughts about choosing Supreme Court justices were getting remotely as much respect from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley, and most other GOP senators. We can discern from Hamilton\u0027s owns words what he probably would have thought of Senate Republicans\u0027 vow not to consider any Supreme Court nomination President Obama puts forward for Justice Antonin Scalia\u0027s successor. The best guess, based on the historical evidence, is that Hamilton and other of the Constitution\u0027s Framers would have been appalled by the confirmation antics of McConnell \u0026 Co.International Women\u0027s Day -- March 8 -- is one of my favorite days. It is a time to celebrate the impressive progress women at all levels of the career ladder have made in recent decades.Managing Director, IMF\"I hope that no one will ever tell a girl that there is something she can\u0027t do because she is a girl.\"Former First LadyInternational Women\u0027s Day is coming up on Tuesday, March 8 is International Women\u0027s Day and it is time to take a look at where we are.Journalism/English teacherIt isn\u0027t just about empowering women and girls because it\u0027s the right thing -- our vision of a poverty-free world depends on it.CEO, UnileverTrump is not an accident thrust by fate on an undeserving party. He is a mirror of what the GOP has become. He is, quite simply, a particularly embarrassing manifestation of the party\u0027s aversion to fact, appeals to fear, immunity to reason, and nihilistic denunciations of government as the source of all our problems.Novelist and contributing opinion writerCompared to developing countries too, the U.S. lags in terms of gender parity. In nations where you would least expect progress towards gender parity to have been made, mandates or quotas have propelled women ahead of those in the U.S.Advocate of diverse, gender-balanced corporate boards. Chair of Corporate Board Initiative, Women\u0027s Forum of NY. Co-CEO, Chadick Ellig.What does it say about our country when the debate for the highest office in the land becomes about whose genitals are larger, who can kill the most civilians and reinstate torture, and which religious minorities to persecute?Civil rights attorney and Chief Executive Director of CAIR-FloridaWhile Trump is legitimately terrifying, I would argue that the rise of outside politicians like Trump and Sanders may ultimately be a good thing for our country. Maybe these aren\u0027t end times after all. Maybe it\u0027s a beginning.Democratic candidate for U.S. Representative of North Carolina\u0027s 2nd Congressional DistrictGovernments looking to grow economies in this era of instability would be well advised to look at the return on investments in women and the care economy. The ripple effect of women\u0027s lives on families, communities and economies is a multiplier that would please most finance ministers.General Secretary, International Trade Union ConfederationA wide range of impatient, courageous rabble rousers, both globally and here in the U.S., are becoming un-ignorable -- even to the notoriously myopic mainstream media.Vice President, Policy, The Aspen Institute and Executive Director of AscendExecutive Director, Aspen Global Health and DevelopmentLook, I\u0027m not saying that Trumpdemort is not a formidable opponent. He is crafty. He\u0027s been at this for a while. And he has hordes of Death Eaters at his back. But if we band together in this Order of the (Political) Phoenix, we have a chance.Radio host; Associate Professor, Baldwin Wallace UniversityWith the advent of North American energy abundance in 2012, petroleum enthusiasts began to promote the idea of a \"new American industrial renaissance\" based on accelerated shale oil and gas production and the development of related petrochemical enterprises.Author and Professor of Peace and World-Security Studies, Hampshire CollegeMeaning in life without religion can be found in the many familiar, meaning-conferring elements that aren\u0027t religious in nature. Our lives will end permanently some day. All that matters is what our lives are like while they last.Graduate student in philosophy at UC San DiegoI still don\u0027t know how moms do it, but I have deeper appreciation for them now. Wives and mothers, if you want your partner to understand how it feels to be the default caretaker, convince your husband to take a trip with your child -- and without you.Photographer/filmmaker based in BeijingNo matter what Hillary Clinton accomplishes, a primary reaction is to diminish it, to try to erase it. Frankly, any reasonably successful woman past the age of 40 has experienced these kinds of dismissals over and over again.Professor in the Marketing Department of the McCombs School of Business at the University of TexasAfter witnessing the tragic plastic problem in Bali, I suddenly became hyper aware of the various bad behaviors tourists tend to unwittingly exhibit. Think you might be guilty of a bad habit or two?Founder and blogger of Travel LushesSanders stated that \"white\" Americans don\u0027t know what it\u0027s like to live like African Americans in U.S. ghettos. The statement was right on, but commentators quickly took it out of context.Assistant Professor of History, University of Nevada at Las Vegas (UNLV)Language has power--and even casual office chit-chat can reinforce biased behavior amongst employees. While your organization may be telling women one thing-- to be more confident, take more risks, negotiate harder--do all the messages really add up?Satire \u0026 Comedy from The Second CityFather than treating it as a jobs program, let\u0027s make the F-35 program rise or fall on its merits. That would mean holding off on the 450-plane \"block buy\" contemplated by the Pentagon, and deciding whether it\u0027s worth going beyond the 500 planes already committed to, out of a planned total of over 2,400.Director, Arms and Security Project, Center for International PolicyMitt made a long speech full of many detailed reasons why Donald Trump is absolutely unacceptable as a presidential candidate; but if Trump becomes the nominee, then Mitt will put party in front of country and go right ahead and support Trump anyway.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comThere are days when I want to dedicate my entire life to my mother. Sometimes I think about how much I want to spend my life as a pathologist searching for a cure to the disease that took her life. But my mom wouldn\u0027t want me to spend my life like that. Your parent wouldn\u0027t want you to make them the shrine of your life.College student and writerVoters owe it to the citizens of Flint and kids everywhere to ask a different question this election cycle. Don\u0027t ask for less government -- instead, ask: how do we make sure government works for the citizens who need it the most?global strategic advisor, speaker, NYU Lecturer, and author, Mission ControlRenouncing responsibility or ties to the U.S. if we don\u0027t like the outcome is escapism. Aversion won\u0027t do anything to better our country and will result in an increasingly one-sided political landscape.U.S. diplomat and freelance writerA three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington DC rejected the for-profit college trade group\u0027s challenge to the Obama Administration\u0027s gainful employment rule, a regulation that holds career training programs accountable for consistently leaving students with overwhelming debt.Attorney, advocate, writer at RepublicReport.org\"There\u0027s a certain astonishment on my part that we\u0027ve gone through so many cycles of what\u0027s in, what\u0027s popular--and not in a healthy way, the way the record business is now.\"Trafficbeat Entertainment, Music Biz VetThis is not a handout that American working families are pleading for, but rather, as a country, this is our moral responsibility to begin putting family first and recognizing the human needs that families are being deprived of.Mother and writerIt\u0027s a rare day when the prohibitionist establishment and die-hard drug policy reformers are in agreement -- but that happens to be the case more often than not when it comes to what the U.S. insists on calling \"synthetic drugs.\"The full spectrum of human relationships with drugsSecretary Clinton is my choice for President because her idealism combined with pragmatism is absolutely essential to winning the election in November. Donald Trump can brag all day about his deal-making, but it\u0027s Hillary, working in government, who\u0027s proved to be a champion negotiator.Founder, GlobalGrind.comThe Bank Whistleblowers United\u0027s third weekly lemons award is made jointly to the Federal Housing Finance Agency and Fannie Mae (with a dishonorable mention to the federal judiciary).
