That gave workers bargaining power to get a fair share of the economy\u0027s gains -- and unions helped improve wages and working conditions for everyone. But as union membership has weakened -- from more than a third of all private-sector workers belonging unions in the 1950s to fewer than 7 percent today -- the bargaining power of average workers has all but disappeared.
