{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The pile-on by Republicans and the media on Obama\u0027s foreign policy challenges is excessive. I mean, what would you have him do that is more sensible than what he\u0027s doing? Let\u0027s take the big issues one at a time. Russia: There is simply no good course of action against Vladimir Putin\u0027s grab of Eastern Ukraine. This is a majority-Russian region, and Putin has been both ruthless and deft at using thuggish locals as cats\u0027 paws for an eventual takeover. Obama is pursuing economic sanctions and threatening more sanctions, despite being undercut by our European allies. The U.S. is pursuing Containment II to try to isolate Russia that is not all that dependent on global trade, and the original Containment took more than four decades. Maybe there will yet be some kind of de facto compromise, in which Eastern Ukraine becomes a Russian protectorate and Western Ukraine is able to become part of Europe.On Friday we learned that a lot of Republican U.S. senators and a smattering of Democrats are once again trying to make an end run around a legitimate process to assess the impacts of the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline.Robert RedfordActor, director and environmental activistInstead of looking in the mirror, our politicians blame the schools. They say that we lost those jobs because our schools were preparing students poorly, not because the \"job creators\" wanted to export jobs to countries that pay their workers a few dollars a day.Diane RavitchResearch Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027The average net worth of the 41 GOP senators who opposed the first minimum wage increase in half a decade is $6.26 million.Leo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersIn honor of Huffington Post\u0027s 9th birthday, we\u0027re celebrating by sharing 9 ways to reinvent yourself. That\u0027s because Arianna herself has been a shining example of reinvention for her entire career.\"You have to do what you dream of doing,\" Arianna once said, \"even while you\u0027re afraid.\"Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistEven though French economist Thomas Piketty has made an air-tight case that we\u0027re heading toward levels of inequality not seen since the days of the nineteenth-century robber barons, right-wing conservatives haven\u0027t stopped lying about what\u0027s happening and what to do about it.Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027You are the only person professionally qualified to be yourself. So why are you spending so much of your time and energy trying to improve, enhance, fix or change the person that you already are?Panache DesaiContemporary thought leader and spiritual teacherHis school will receive a zero for my opting him out, which will lower his school\u0027s proficiency standings. On one hand, I feel bad that his school is being punished for my decision. But it is not me who is punishing the school: Our government is punishing them.Pauline HawkinsEnglish teacherThe Supreme Court ruling is another giant leap toward theocracy. We are descending to new lows, where non-Christians are openly scorned, made to stand up in public to be identified as outcasts.Jeff SchweitzerScientist and former White House Senior Policy Analyst; Ph.D. in marine biology/neurophysiologyIn today\u0027s society, marriage happens when two people (usually a man and a woman) fall in love and decide to spend the rest of their lives together in monogamy. But did you know that wasn\u0027t always the case?Lisa HaishaCreator of Transformative Therapy, SoulBlazingThree of the major factors in the basic oppression of women in the developing world are child labor, child marriage and gender-based violence. Getting girls into primary school and giving them the opportunity for secondary education are important tools for addressing these sources of vulnerability.Michael RothPresident, Wesleyan UniversityMost \"superheroes\" are nothing of the sort. They\u0027re weird, neurotic creatures who do big things DESPITE lots of self-defeating habits and self-talk.Tim FerrissAuthor, \u0027The 4-Hour Workweek\u0027Until we have a full-proof justice system that treats everyone equally under the law, we cannot falsely believe that everyone executed is in fact guilty. The process itself is cruel and in one of the most modern countries on the planet, there is simply no place for it.Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkDon\u0027t expect a recruiter or employer to look at your resume and figure out what you can do and where you could fit into their organization.Susan P. JoyceEditor and chief technology writer, Job - Hunt.orgIn most countries, girls outperform boys in math. However, in the US, boys uniformly best girls. We are joined in the low-performing bottom three by Liechtenstein and Columbia. While we have the greater problem that math and science education in the US seriously lags that of other nations, we must face the fact that that lag is also the product of gender inequities.Soraya ChemalyFeminist, Writer, Satirist... not always in that orderGame of Thrones is a homily about a great civilization beginning to tear itself apart. In this sense it is a very sad tale. But in the life of our grandparents we have suffered many such \"sad stories of the death of kings.\" But Martin\u0027s mythic tales are not just about the death of kings. They are about us.Michael VlahosBarack Obama told us there would be no compromise on net neutrality. We heard him say it back in 2007, when he first was running for president. He said it many more times. And defenders of net neutrality believed him.Bill MoyersMichael WinshipI say \"our\" girls because we are all one human family, and those 300 frightened teenagers sold into rape and slavery are our sisters, nieces, daughters and granddaughters. Each one of these girls is precious to us and deserves to live in freedom from fear and freedom to learn to think for herself.Christine PelosiChair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusTwitter is sizable and the users who love it really, really love it. It\u0027s unlikely to wither on the vine or disappear, provided Twitter itself doesn\u0027t get lured by Wall Street\u0027s siren call into making major changes that alter the essential real-time information sharing ecosystem it dominates.Noah MallinDigital Advertising, Content and Startup AdvisorWhen I talk about fatphobia, I\u0027m often viewed with confusion and disbelief. We laugh at fat jokes, discuss at length banning fat marriage, make comments about how fat people should exercise or kill themselves. We may be threatened with murder for making a documentary on fatness. But fatphobia isn\u0027t real, right?Kitty Strykersex critical porn performerI\u0027ve been running for a little over seven years -- for some that\u0027s a lifetime, for others, I\u0027ve just started. I hardly feel a difference, but after all these days, years and miles, when I look carefully, I see everything is different.Nicole ScottWife, Mother, Runner, Writer at MyFitFamilyYour bullying tactics are exactly what makes me embarrassed to be a consumer.Tony PosnanskiWriter, \u0027The Anti-Jared\u0027It\u0027s a hollow kind of freedom that allows people to practice whatever faith they choose but says they must sit nicely through the Christian worship regardless.Antonia BlumbergAssociate Editor, HuffPost ReligionPresident Obama has just returned from a trip to Asia where he was criticized for not being \"tougher\" with China. However, Americans may want to consider whether \"containing\" China with a \"pivot\" to Asia is an affordable proposition.Mark WeisbrotCo-director, Center for Economic and Policy Research, Washington, D.C.He calls her \"Jenny\" and \"babe\" and suggests she eat a burger, joining a storied Esquire tradition we like to call: \"Part Of The Problem.\"Emma GraySenior Editor, HuffPost WomenThis is the movie we have been waiting for. It will change how we think and act forever about this problem. It is a powerful indictment of how the food industry hooks us on addictive processed foods laden with hidden sugars.Mark Hyman, MDPracticing physicianWhat if we knew that the fictional rapes in HBO\u0027s mega-hit Game of Thrones caused real rapes in the real world? What if we knew that the portrayals of gay characters in Modern Family caused actual states to legalize same-sex marriage? The catch, of course, is causation.Marty KaplanUSC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorAfter reading and rereading the speech, \u0027Why the Middle East Matters,\u0027 I was struck by how similar it was to the \u0027agitprop\u0027 used by George W. Bush in the lead-up to the Iraq war.James ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Filipino officials have emphatically announced a new era in Philippine-U.S. bilateral alliance. Critics, however, believe the administration has offered Americans precious access to Philippine bases in exchange for marginal tactical advantages.Richard Javad HeydarianAcademic, policy advisor, and author of \"How Capitalism Failed the Arab World: The Economic Roots and Precarious Future of the Middle East Uprisings\"His racism got all the headlines, but there was something to be learned from Donald Sterling\u0027s other words. It is worth considering his usefulness as a representative sample of the oligarchical class.Richard (RJ) EskowSenior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourThe fictional \u0027girl next door\u0027 should be the girl changing the world with all the geekiness, creativity and overwhelming drive she can muster -- sparkly things optional, but strongly encouraged.Nicole EdineAssociate Editor, Social ImpactGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"MAMMOTH MELT",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
