{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOLights, camera, politics! The stretch run of the \u002708 race has unleashed a torrent of citizen-created campaign videos, turning my inbox into a contagious media multiplex, and our HuffPost team into viral video Roger Eberts. Among our favorites: the astounding Obama/McCain dance-off (how did they do that?); the hysterical (and surprisingly poignant) return of the Waaaasup! guys; Opie and the Fonz come out for Obama (so do these alta cocker comedians); the \"Change My World\" choir; and the powerful sentiments of these Local Voices and these Conservatives for Obama. Plus, our own 23/6 has been knocking it out of the park on a regular basis, with Get Your War On, the Sarah Palin vlog, and SwiftJews for Truth. So break out the popcorn, hit play... then pass them on.Read Post | CommentsBIOLarry David, 10.22.2008This is like waiting for the results of a biopsy. Actually, it\u0027s worse. Biopsies only take a few days, maybe a week at the most, and if the biopsy comes back positive, there\u0027s still a potential cure. With this, there\u0027s no cure. The result is final. Like death.Read Post | Comments (1919)BIOJames Carville and Paul Begala, 10.20.2008We have a message for our Republican friends: It is time to point fingers. We are pro-finger-pointing. And here\u0027s the most important thing about finger-pointing: you have to start early.Read Post | Comments (634)BIOAlbert Brooks, 10.24.2008Let\u0027s say McCain wins and Sarah Palin takes over for Dick Cheney. I think it will be a smooth transition, we won\u0027t even miss a beat. I\u0027m here to say, \"What\u0027s the worst that can happen?\"Read Post | Comments (200)BIOArianna Huffington, 10.20.2008Age has finally become an issue for John McCain. But the problem isn\u0027t the candidate\u0027s 72 years; it\u0027s the antediluvian approach of his campaign.Read Post | Comments (805)BIOKen Adelman, 10.24.2008McCain\u0027s temperament -- leading him to bizarre behavior during the week the economic crisis broke -- and his judgment -- leading him to Wasilla -- depressed me into thinking that he\u0027d be a(nother) lousy conservative president. Been there, done that.Read Post | Comments (262)BIOJohn Dinges, 10.24.2008In 1985, McCain traveled to Chile for a friendly meeting with the country\u0027s military ruler, one of the world\u0027s most notorious violators of human rights credited with killing more than 3,000 civilians and jailing tens of thousands of others.Read Post | Comments (539)BIOAlec Baldwin, 10.20.2008What did some of you people actually think would happen with Palin on SNL? Saturday Night Live is a comedy show. It\u0027s not Meet the Press.Read Post | Comments (1403)BIOCC Goldwater, 10.23.2008Being Barry Goldwater\u0027s granddaughter and living in Arizona, one would assume that I am voting for John McCain. However, nothing about McCain compares to the ideology my grandfather stood for.Read Post | Comments (812)BIOPaul Hipp, 10.23.2008Let\u0027s do all we can for the man whose name sounds like peeing in the snow! It is time to take our country out of Romper Room and back into the position of leadership among nations. Calling for witch hunts ain\u0027t gonna do it.Read Post | Comments (33)BIOAdam McKay, 10.24.2008\"I will be voting for the candidate I believe is best: Barack Obama,\" McCain said. \"But I hope that voters will take that endorsement with a grain of salt and consider the source.\"Read Post | Comments (36)BIOChris Kelly, 10.23.2008Yesterday Sarah Palin did a phone interview with James Dobson of Focus on the Family. Most of it went pretty well -- lucky, he\u0027s a creep who likes children -- but there was one ugly gotcha question.Read Post | Comments (492)BIORichard Lewis, 10.24.2008I simply will not tolerate another stolen vote and election, tantamount to a sentence of another four-to-eight years of Hell, because we haven\u0027t been vigilant and done our jobs.Read Post | Comments (240)Elayne Boosler, 10.23.2008Lee Camp, 10.24.2008Melina Bellows, 10.23.2008Eugene Jarecki, 10.24.2008Jason Whitlock, 10.23.2008David Bromwich, 10.21.2008Barbara Ehrenreich, 10.21.2008Andrew Bacevich, 10.22.2008Steven Weber, 10.21.2008Paul Slansky, 10.20.2008Peter Daou, 10.21.2008Mary Mapes, 10.23.2008Phillip Martin, 10.24.2008Patt Morrison, 10.25.2008Karen Russell, 10.25.2008Stewart Acuff, 10.25.2008Lloyd Garver, 10.25.2008Huff TV, 10.25.2008Steven Weber, 10.25.2008","h1":"Using a mobile device?
