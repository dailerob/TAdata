{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Ron BurgundyLegendary News AnchorNews. What is \"news,\" really? I believe news is a beacon of justice, illuminating the dark corners of the Earth. I believe that news is a powerful stallion of justice, galloping across this great, fragrant, fertile land. I know news. So I took a look at some of the top \"news\" stories I saw on Huffington Post to see just how newsy you are.Comments (5)Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The impact of freedom summer was electric. It added to the pressure on Congress to pass what became the Voting Rights Act of 1965. But first, there had to be more marches, more murders, and finally, after the Selma marches and LBJ\u0027s stunning \"We Shall Overcome\" speech, the federal guarantee of the right to register and vote -- in the same Act whose key provision the Roberts Court has overturned. What we need is a new Freedom Summer 2014, half a century after the original. If the forces of reaction are demanding photo ID cards, let\u0027s just go door to door and make sure that every eligible voter gets one.Comments (23)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkDo we really believe that a young teenager from an inner city or from a rural area who had a rough upbringing would receive time at a treatment facility if he/she killed four people after driving drunk? I don\u0027t think so, and neither do the majority of us.Comments (22)Diane PhamSenior Editor, InhabitatFor many, the thought of a parking garage conjures no more than the vision of endlessly winding one\u0027s car up through a utilitarian building. While this is true of many garages, there are designers who are rethinking the form, turning these spaces into iconic architectural works while minimizing urban sprawl and environmental impact.CommentsPeter CappelliAuthor and Professor of Management at The Wharton SchoolMost of these companies want to refer to themselves and their employees as a kind of family, but what kind of family allows its members to go hungry? And what prevents you from doing something about it?CommentsRobert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, Beyond OutrageIt\u0027s charity time, and not just because the holiday season reminds us to be charitable. As the tax year draws to a close, the charitable tax deduction beckons. If Congress ever gets around to revising the tax code, it might consider limiting the charitable deduction to real charities.Comments (31)Valerie AlexanderAuthor, \u0027Happiness as a Second Language\u0027Choose the man who will take care of the laundry and change the baby\u0027s diapers when you\u0027ve got the flu, rather than the one who spent a month choreographing his proposal so that the video of it would go viral.Comments (38)Adam WinklerProfessor of Law, UCLAIs it time to rethink the longstanding ban on plural marriage? While the ability to choose one\u0027s sexual partners is an important element of constitutionally protected privacy, polygamy has long been associated with unique harmsCommentsRandi WeingartenPresident, American Federation of TeachersWhat if, instead of using international rankings to bash our students, schools and teachers, we learned from top-performing countries and applied their lessons for the benefit of all children?Comments (29)John PavleyCTO @ The Huffington Post, BloggerI assume the term killer app came from the phrase \"to make a killing.\" I never thought much about the metaphor -- the use of the word \"killing\" as a synonym for \"succeeding\" or \"winning.\" But it\u0027s a little creepy to think about what the word killer really means. After all, a \"murder app\" or \"homicidal app\" doesn\u0027t sound appealing, and yet all these words are interchangeable synonyms.CommentsNoah MichelsonEditor, HuffPost Gay VoicesIt\u0027s time that we made a promise to ourselves that we won\u0027t look the other way any longer. It\u0027s time that we started challenging each other and ourselves to be accountable to what we believe and what we espouse.Comments (148)Susannah LewisFreelance writer, blogger, aspiring best-selling author, wife, momI was one whiff of B.O. away from some serious lid-flippage when suddenly a strong notion came upon me. I tried to quiet the voice in my head, but it continued to compel me to do something that I had no desire to do. \"Give her the toys.\"CommentsPaul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostIn response to critics who label him a Marxist, Pope Francis is taking a page from the famous Seinfeld scene: No, my critique of capitalism is not because I\u0027m a Marxist (not that there\u0027s anything wrong with that) -- it\u0027s because I\u0027m a Christian.Comments (315)Gary HartUnited States Senator (Ret.)Newtown is a very dark cloud growing over the bright promise and hope of America. It cannot be merely accepted as a fact of modern life. It must be addressed and dealt with in the best ways the human mind and heart may devise. We are not permitted to forget and move on.Comments (26)Jessica Ann MitchellWriter for OurLegaci.com and founder of Black Bloggers ConnectThis defense obviously doesn\u0027t work for black and poor youth. Yet, news outlets are spiraling about 16-year-old Ethan Couch who caused the deaths of four people by drunk driving. His defense was that he suffered from \"Affluenza\" -- a disorder that only the affluent have.Comments (117)Tony NewmanDirector of Media Relations, Drug Policy Alliance2013 will go down in history as the beginning of the end of our disastrous war on drugs. Here are some of the top stories that made 2013 a watershed year in the fight to end America\u0027s longest failed war.CommentsAnn JonesAuthor, \u0027They Were Soldiers: How the Wounded Return From America’s Wars -- The Untold Story\u0027The JROTC program, still spreading in high schools across the country, costs U.S. taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars annually. It has cost some unknown number of taxpayers their children.Comments (59)Jeff CohenAuthor and media criticI saw Noam Chomsky as my mentor -- way before we ever met. When I was in college in the late 1960s/early \u002770s, he was already a guiding light for me, an exemplar of how those with privilege and principles should live our lives.CommentsAndrew ZimbalistRobert A. Woods Professor of Economics, Smith CollegeAlthough Rodriguez may think that MLB\u0027s aggressiveness to procure evidence was motivated by a personal vendetta, the public should recognize it for what it is -- an energetic effort by MLB to eliminate the use of performance enhancing drugs from the national pastime.CommentsGordon BrownFormer Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationWe all now know of Mandela\u0027s strength of will and belief: his defiance facing possible execution, his resilience even faced with a 27-year prison sentence often in solitary detention. But I wanted also to tell the story of Graça, the heroine who guided Mandela through his last years.CommentsBernice A. KingChief Executive Officer, The King CenterMy family\u0027s appreciation of Mr. Mandela dates back nearly a half century, long before millions knew who he was, when my father, Martin Luther King, Jr. was in London preparing for his acceptance of the Nobel Prize for Peace to occur three days later in Oslo, Norway.CommentsLibby LefflerPartnerships at FacebookThe power of one connection can lead to a movement. Nonprofits work to connect individuals with the causes, organizations, and people that are important to them and can now use Facebook to aid in that effort.CommentsAntonio CentenoFounder of RealMenRealStyle.comHow does a man tie a scarf? A simple question -- but one that has become more complex as the scarf itself has become more associated with women than men over the last 50 years. This has led to a shift in how this classic men\u0027s accessory is viewed. That\u0027s unfortunate.CommentsLeo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersAs the GOP abruptly ends unemployment benefits, Republicans intend to slash food aid as well. They want to cut $4 billion a year from the food stamp program that many jobless families depend on for meals. This will occur as struggling food pantries report bare shelves.CommentsDr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarThe great thing about celebrity narcissism is that we hold the clicker. When we\u0027ve had enough, we can simply move on to another distraction. In our lives, the closer the narcissist is, the hard it is to escape the vortex.Comments (15)FreaktographyPhotographer, Urban ExplorerWhat I\u0027ve come to admire about the abandoned house is what I call the pieces of life left behind, the mystery of what caused this home or business, once full of life to become dark and vacant. From bullets, to love letters, bibles, records, creepy dolls and trophies of one\u0027s accomplishments -- there is always something to be found (and left behind when you leave) inside an abandoned house.CommentsWendell PotterAuthor, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgBoth the AAN and Chamber have spent millions on ads calling for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. While Aetna stands to gain financially from the law, it and other insurers have been critical of the potentially profit-threatening consumer protections and regulations in it.CommentsThomas E. PerezU.S. Secretary of LaborThe Labor Department\u0027s Hall of Honor recognizes men and women -- like Cesar Chavez, Helen Keller and the Workers of the Memphis Sanitation Strike -- who have made invaluable contributions to the welfare of American workers.CommentsThe Moto Ladythemotolady.comSomething came up? No big deal. Have to cancel plans? That\u0027s cool, we\u0027ll go have a date with our first love -- our motorbike. When you\u0027re familiar with being on the road you develop an ability to go with the flow.CommentsSen. Tom HarkinDemocratic Senator from IowaTo read some of the headlines over the past few weeks, it is clear that the chattering class in Washington is once again trying to scare the American public about the future of Social Security.CommentsMenachem RosensaftProfessor of law and son of Holocaust survivorsMore than 68 years after Allied troops liberated the German death and concentration camps in which millions of European Jews had been ruthlessly murdered, many of those who miraculously survived live precariously in dire circumstances.CommentsJohn FarrEditor, bestmoviesbyfarr.comToday every classic movie fan mourns the death of Peter O\u0027Toole at 81. The spirit of mischievous exuberance he brought to his life -- and all his roles -- somehow made me believe he could never die, even when you could see the smoking and drinking had taken its toll on his once startling good looks.CommentsAlon TalVisiting professor, Stanford Center for Conservation BiologyIf desalination can provide additional water, then cooperating to deliver it more efficiently and equitably across the region makes perfect sense. But it is important that any enthusiasm be tempered by hydrological realism. The relentless increase in population undermines any meaningful progress.CommentsChris Weigant, 2013.16.12Peter Cappelli, 2013.16.12Rabbi Yaacov Behrman, 2013.16.12Nancy Sharp, 2013.16.12Natalie MacNeil, 2013.16.12Adam Resnick, 2013.16.12Neely Steinberg, 2013.16.12Viator, 2013.16.12Budget Travel, 2013.16.12The Moto Lady, 2013.16.12Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"TOLD YA",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BizYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
