{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"From tm-techmark.comWhat were Sulzberger and company thinking? There Pinch was, prancing around for the last year under the illusion that his defense of Judy Miller was going to be his reputation-making Pentagon Papers moment, while doing the exact opposite of what his father did with the Pentagon Papers by sitting on the bombshell NSA spying story for a year. Now, instead of crusading journalists, Sulzberger and his editors look like a bunch of schmucks -- or, worse, a bunch of toadies doing the White House’s bidding.READ POST | comments (38)12.19.2005 Marty KaplanRockefeller told Cheney he could not endorse the program. He said he was keeping a sealed copy of the letter -- for a moment just like this.READ POST | comments (22)12.19.2005 Aaron FreemanCould sombody please stop the spread of democracy in the Middle East? I do not like the way it\u0027s turning out. Iran for example has been having elections for almost thirty years, and look who wins them.READ POST | comments12.19.2005 Larry BeinhartNeo-con punditry spins a theory that fits the false facts and the confusion of the mismatched concepts. They don’t fit reality, but never mind, there’s no one around to point out what reality is.READ POST | comments (18)12.19.2005 Timothy NaftaliOne key difference from now is that in the Cold War no one tried to argue that warrantless monitoring of Americans is legal. Participants in HTLingual understood that the program violated the Fourth Amendment.READ POST | comments (30)12.19.2005 David SirotaHow could he possibly cite speed as the reason for refusing to get search warrants, when those warrants can be issued retroactively, and thus do not slow down operations in any way at all?READ POST | comments (58)12.19.2005 Martin GarbusNixon lost on the exact same issue that Bush presents. How, then, does Bush, Alberto Gonzales, the Attorney General (and his predecessor John Ashcroft) argue they have the right to do it?READ POST | comments (26)12.19.2005 Deepak ChopraWithout even touching on the horrors at Abu Ghraib and the alleged secret prisons in Eastern Europe, this generation of Americans has a long way to go before we return to the gold standard in the eyes of the world.READ POST | comments (12)12.19.2005 Harry ShearerYou\u0027d think, with the popularity of CBS\u0027 police procedurals, that the major media would delight in sharing the Times-Picayune\u0027s detailed coverage of the forensic investigation into the failure of the floodwalls.READ POST | comments12.19.2005 Rep. Sherrod BrownProgressives knew that legislation is only one way to fight social and economic justice. They knew that we must also directly confront the sources of that injustice.READ POST | comments (33)12.18.2005 Vice Prime Minister Ehud OlmertAs painful as it was, we realized that we could not continue to implement the Prime Minister’s vision for a better future with the current party situation and hence, Kadima was born.READ POST | comments (67)12.18.2005 Marty KaplanIs there anyone more useless than Condi Rice? She was Russert\u0027s first guest, and he gave her ten feet of rope to hang herself with. On the eavesdropping front, she actually said, \"I am not a lawyer\" -- not once, but three times.READ POST | comments (65)12.18.2005 Harry ShearerBecause I seem to know the identity and whereabouts, at least for part of last year, of the supposedly most-wanted terrorist leader in Iraq.READ POST | comments (38)12.18.2005 James PinkertonLong after Fitzgerald has completed his work, prosecutorial pressure on the press will continue, to the point where every reporter with confidential information has one foot in a prison cell.READ POST | comments (49)12.18.2005 Suzanne NosselThe Fighting Dems--the nine and counting Iraq military vets who are running for Congress as Democrats--speak from the heart, and from the pain of real and recent experience on the battlefront.READ POST | comments12.18.2005 Cenk UygurA bunch of football players wanted to party, get some strippers, some lap dances and some blowjobs.
