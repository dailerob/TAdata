{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"An important new study released this morning by Travel Effect found that 40 percent of American workers will leave paid vacation days unused. The four reasons cited the most are the dread of returning from a vacation to piles of work (40 percent), the belief that no one will be able to step in and do their job for them while they\u0027re gone (35 percent), not being able to afford it (33 percent) and the fear of being seen as replaceable (22 percent). \"Americans suffer from a work martyr complex,\" said Roger Dow, President and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association. \"In part, it\u0027s because \u0027busyness\u0027 is something we wear as a badge of honor.\" Clearly, we need to work harder about working smarter -- by not working all the time. The \"work martyr\" complex needs to go the way of the Dictaphone, typewriter and green eyeshades as relics of the workplace of the past (okay, I like typewriters, but you get the idea).The idea that America had reached some level of post-racism with the election of Barack Obama was always delusionary. But it was true that great strides had been made in the half-century or so that followed the civil rights movement. Now, because of the persistence of racism and a relaxation of the fight against it, we are moving backwards.Distinguished Senior Fellow at Demos, former New York Times columnistClergy and lay people have played a crucial role in Ferguson. These religious leaders provide a buffer at protests, press for justice for Michael Brown, and witness against systemic racism and inequality.Executive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostWhat happened to James Foley is the unthinkable. But he is not gone: The memory of him, and those like him, drives me to be a better journalist, a better person. The task of bearing witness to conflict can be fatal, but it is important. And anyone who thinks intimidating or killing journalists will stop the truth from coming out is sorely mistaken.Middle East correspondent, The WorldPostI understand anti-Semitism to be a hatred of Jews, the denial of the right for Jews to have a homeland, the denial of the horrors of the last century and the plight of the Jewish people throughout history. This is obviously not my position. Anti-Semitism, Islamaphobia and homophobia are all prejudices that I resolutely reject, like any right-minded person.Actor and comedianI\u0027m not about to bring another free loader with bodily fluids into my house. I\u0027ve occasionally considered a goldfish and deemed them too much hassle less than 24 hours later. We are gloriously pet-free and I refuse to feel bad about that.writer of oddlywelladjusted.com, and at Notabli.com, mother, and very occasional stand up comicIf the early reports are correct and journalist James Foley was, in fact, executed by ISIS, you can honor him -- and not play into the terroristic hands of that organization -- simply by not watching the video of his murder.Professor and Brechner Eminent Scholar in Mass Communication, University of Florida in GainesvilleNo wonder Americans feel powerless. No surprise we\u0027re sick of politics, and many of us aren\u0027t even voting. But if we give up on politics, we\u0027re done for. Powerlessness is a self-fulfilling prophesy.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027In 1978, a 14-year-old boy invented email. He created a computer program, which he called \"email,\" that replicated all the functions of the interoffice mail system: Inbox, Outbox, Folders, Memo, Attachments, Address Book, etc., the now familiar parts of every email system.Chairman \u0026 CEO of Racepoint GlobalThe fatal shooting of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old African American, by a white police officer has touched off debates throughout the United States on racial harassment by the police and the increasing militarization of ordinary law enforcement after 9/11. Lost in the discussion, however, has been the role guns played.Professor of Law, UCLAIt\u0027s fine for pundits to yearn for open dialogue and rhetorical leadership from the White House. It\u0027s less helpful for them to ignore the unpleasant realities of nasty partisan politics in the age of Obama. It does no good to pretend race baiting hasn\u0027t become a badge of honor and a professional path to success for lots of right-wing pundits.Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaIf you also believe that most Black families in the United States have talked about Ferguson, what does it say about the rest of us if we have not?Parent, Pastor and WriterMissouri is America, and like the nation itself, both racial strife and promise, are part of its enduring legacy. Long before black teenager Michael Brown, died tragically in a hail of police bullets, the dramatic epicenter of America\u0027s racial fault lines often emerged in Missouri.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityA truly honest effort in this area would address both the police and civilian constituencies, and de-escalate an arms race that has been going on for far too long -- to the benefit of only the gun industry.Executive Director, Coalition to Stop Gun ViolenceThis guy. Next you\u0027re going to tell me it\u0027s not rad to leave no trace in your own apartment. Okay, whatever. Like clothes on the floor are so badass. You don\u0027t even know man. Quinoa salad is delicious.Writer, ProducerClinical assessment that includes a test of the knee jerk reflex is fine. Clinical decisions driven by it are not, but they too, are out there.Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterLast week my friend, Professor Jenny Boylan of Barnard College, penned an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times entitled \"Trans Community Can Change Minds by Changing Discourse.\" She uses the promotion of marriage equality as the gay analogue to what the trans community now needs. With all due respect, I think she\u0027s got it backwards.Executive Director, Gender Rights MarylandWith the nation\u0027s outrage in full view, I believe that this case gives an outlet to a rising sense of power felt by parents and youth alike to call into question the behavior exhibited by those who are sworn to protect and serve all citizens.Senior Pastor, Potter\u0027s House, TexasI\u0027m using the word \"reconciliation\" in a very specific rules-of-the-Senate fashion. Because McConnell just revealed to Politico how he intends to govern, should his party take control of the Senate in November -- and it appears that the previously-arcane \"budget reconciliation\" maneuver will figure heavily in his playbook.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comHe had a legion of fans who found him a fountain for laughter, but he also had a number of us who knew him as a wellspring for support for human rights and human dignity.Founder, Human Rights Action CenterAggressively punitive and extreme drug policies are steeped in racism. Inherent in the response to drug law enforcement is a biased approach and stark double standards in the perceived threat of drug use by marginalized people.Managing Director of Communications, Drug Policy AllianceA small cadre of psychological scientists have continued over the years to explore the controversial connection between low intelligence and prejudice, and at this point they have overcome most of the methodological barricades, allowing them to rigorously analyze and answer this important societal question.Author, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027A single woman on a teacher\u0027s salary -- surely there must be better homes to place these children in? Julie had offered to take any child that needed a home.President at The SOLD Project, Storyteller, Photographer, ActivistSummer is almost gone, but here is a power trio of 2014 recordings that have heated up my Summer 2014 that I now warmly and even sweatily recommend to help keep your summer alive in the seasons to come.TV Writer; Contributing Editor, Rolling Stone; Co-Author, \u0027Everybody\u0027s Brother\u0027Sometimes it seems like there\u0027s an app for everything. While these are often useful innovations, it is important to remember that not all of them are providing protections if something goes wrong with your purchase.Commissioner, Federal Trade CommissionFor at least the last two decades, the Democratic Party has been defined both by being the party of African-Americans and by an extraordinary timidity when it comes to speaking out about racism. In this regard, the relative silence is not surprising and is unfortunately exactly what is expected.lincolnmitchell.comWhile I have already seen many friends experience a roller-coaster of emotions during long-term relationships, I know that romantic love is a milestone I have plenty of years left to take on.Student, Wake Forest UniversityIt\u0027s bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb bomb if not (yet) Iran... then Iraq, or Pakistan, or Libya, or Yemen, or (insert intransigent foreign country/peoples here). And like cults everywhere, it\u0027s best not to question the core belief and practices of its leaders -- after all, bombs bursting in air is now as American as the \"Star Spangled Banner.\"Writer, Professor, Retired Lt. Colonel, Air ForceHow, in the modern age, can a state put on such sham proceedings, open to the world, and get away with it?Lawyer, activist and authorAs responsible citizens we must demand that our government exercise all influence to bring the Israeli government to honest, productive negotiations with the Palestinian unity government, to achieve lasting justice upon which an enduring peace, security, and prosperity can be achieved by all.Actor, producer and humanitarianCorporations are complaining that this (lowered) rate makes them \"uncompetitive\" and are demanding \"corporate tax reform.\" Because job creators -- or something. This time they threaten to -- or do -- renounce their U.S. citizenship. But are corporate tax rates really \"uncompetitive\"? And what does that even mean?Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"SHOCK VIDEO: STL COPS GUN DOWN MAN",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
