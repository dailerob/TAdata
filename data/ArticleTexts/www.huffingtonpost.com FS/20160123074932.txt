{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Bestselling author of Survival Investing: How to Prosper Amid Thieving Banks and Corrupt Governments and professor of finance at S P Jain School of Global ManagementThe financial crisis is behind us, right? Why would Wall Street shower Hillary Clinton with millions of dollars in speaking fees and tens of millions in campaign contributions? I think it is an insurance policy. Wall Street wants a friend in the White House to protect the status quo, and if they can\u0027t get a Republican elected, Hillary is the next best thing. I think they need a friend in government because the industry could not survive an investigation into how they actually make their profits. Wall Street doesn\u0027t want you to know how they make their money. A brief review of how Wall Street bankers earn their outrageous fees and bonuses will highlight why they don\u0027t want to see a reformer like Bernie Sanders succeed.This week, NOAA and NASA announced that 2015 was the hottest year on record globally, by a wide margin.

It means you do not trust her to be a fully adult, fully human, being.Feminist, writer, and satirist (not always in that order)For more than a year, an entire city was exposed to the risk of lead poisoning. Those children will suffer neurological damage for the rest of their lives. Long after you and I are gone, some of them will still be living a life diminished. No matter what happens now, that cannot be undone.Executive Director, The Sierra ClubIf \"affluenza\" is indeed what caused Ethan Couch to get behind the wheel with a blood alcohol count three times the legal limit for adults, resulting in the deaths of four people, he deserves to face consequences.

Senator Bernie Sanders, the \"socialist\" he\u0027s referring to, isn\u0027t a Communist.E.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeWe\u0027ve heard a lot about democratic socialism lately, as the self-described socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders poses an ever-bigger threat to Hillary Clinton. But what is democratic socialism?Executive Vice President, Cato Institute; Author, \u0027The Libertarian Mind\u0027 (2015)Ted Cruz\u0027s position on net neutrality is so full of whoppers that it has to be taken apart, sentence by sentence, to fully demonstrate the depth of his dishonesty.Senior Director of Strategy, Free Press and Free Press Action FundU.S. officials believe it to be too risky but sending aid airdrops is necessary to help Syrians, especially in the besieged Eastern city of Deir Ezzor where thousands of Syrians are starving.Syrian American working to empower local governance structures in SyriaSix years ago this week, the U.S. Supreme Court created a Wild West of campaign finance regulations.

They are created, not born. Bowie was a genius. One more for old times sake, Mister Jones, with glitter on top?Co-founder and songwriter of The RunawaysEnsuring corporate accountability in practice is more difficult, but fortunately the U.S. already has a blueprint from which to build a human rights reporting and monitoring framework for eventual investment in Iran.Director, The International Corporate Accountability RoundtableOne of the worst examples of under-covered hate is the escalation of attacks and the persecution of Christians, particularly outside of the United States, where thousands are routinely murdered and imprisoned, while their magnificent sacred churches are destroyed.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityI was shocked and dismayed at a meeting yesterday of the Environment and Public Works Committee (EPW) to consider S. 659, the so-called \"Bipartisan Sportsmen Act,\" which included an unrelated amendment that weakens our nation\u0027s drinking water protections.Ranking Member, Senate Environment and Public Works CommitteeI would bite back all the words I wanted to say. The hurt and desperation I thought I might be able to share with someone. I recall feeling complete dismay that others couldn\u0027t see how this loss to me felt like grieving an actual death.Writer, poet, traveler, optimist, enthusiast for life.I\u0027m glad Palin spoke up. I\u0027m glad that she\u0027s passionate about the lack of care our vets get when they come home. I\u0027m glad that she used her spotlight to go off script and use her annoyingly shrill voice to raise awareness of a serious issue that\u0027s been plaguing this country for over a century.Richard Zombeck is a freelance writer for hire and a podcaster at T\u0026ZTalk.com.Just 53 men and 9 women have as much wealth as more than 3.6 billion people on this planet.
