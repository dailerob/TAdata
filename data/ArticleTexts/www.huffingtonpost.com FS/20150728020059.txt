{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"LONDON -- Marhaba from London, where we\u0027re launching HuffPost Arabi, our 14th international edition, in partnership with Wadah Khanfar and Integral Media Strategies. While all of our other editions around the world focus on one country, HuffPost Arabi will span the entire Arab World -- comprised of 377 million people living in 22 countries, stretching from Mauritania in the northwest corner of Africa to Oman on the eastern tip of the Arabian Peninsula. So much coverage of the Arab World is from the outside looking in, and the voices of the people most affected by what\u0027s happening are frequently unheard. Our original reporting by independent journalists will showcase the richness of the Arab world -- political debates and business news, but also arts and cultures, religions and traditions, food and human stories. And I\u0027m particularly excited about HuffPost Arabi\u0027s blog platform, where anyone with something to say can share their perspective (in text, video or image) on any subject from politics and religion to cooking, poetry, recipes and personal stories.On the happy occasion of the Huffington Post Arabi launch, I truly hope that we reach for new horizons. I hope that we build it hand in hand with our Arab audience and that with the site we open a door for communication, hope, and gripping, valuable content.President of Sharq Forum and former director general of the Al Jazeera NetworkBy departing from tradition and becoming more inclusive and less doctrinaire, the court has deprived itself of any brakes that might stop the train it has set in motion.

The problem is that government-managed systems are only as good as their stewards, and one of our two major parties hates government.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027No one I knew ever trusted the police.

The company is causing hundreds of thousands of Americans with Hepatitis C to suffer unnecessarily and many of them to die as the result of its monopolistic practices, while public health programs face bankruptcy.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia UniversityWe believe that not only is it possible to find options that align with your values, but also that by continuing to support these alternatives, we can grow those supply chains and industries which are effectively and transparently making sustainable improvements in their supply chain.Co-founder, JUSTThis past weekend the noise over the Clinton State Department emails erupted again as Senate hearing dates were announced.

Houser\u0027s insistence on making public statements regarding his hatred of women is well-documented.Freelance Writer and AuthorDear fellow white feminists, we need to talk about Sandra Bland. More specifically, we need to talk about why we aren\u0027t talking about Sandra Bland.Producer, HuffPost LiveUnlike most filmic reenactments of real-life events in which considerable poetic license is taken to punch up the drama, none is needed for this film because the subjects themselves produced enough gravitas to keep the narrative arc moving toward its shattering conclusion.Founding publisher, Skeptic magazine; editor, Skeptic.comNutrition and sleep are both hot areas of research right now, and recent studies have found that what we eat affects how we sleep, and that in turn, how we sleep can affect what we eat.Writer, Content Manager at AmerisleepWe have a problem in this country called gun violence and we\u0027re not going to solve it by \u0027fixing\u0027 a registration system that hasn\u0027t changed in more than 20 years; it\u0027s not going to be solved by putting the discussion off for another day; and it\u0027s certainly not going to be solved by asking every law-abiding citizen to walk around with a gun.Mike the Gun GuyAsking the black community for forgiveness can now only come through a revamping of an inconsistent police force and a reexamination of an unjust justice system that has become so dysfunctional that it has failed so many Americans.Founder and Chairman: The Second Half Foundation and Centre; Author, The Second Half of Your LifeYou can forget about those slapdash bowls of cereal, say goodbye to gloppy oatmeal and take-out window fast food that\u0027s full of salt, sugars and grease.Los Angeles-based writer, food blogger, adventurous vegetarian and home cookFarrell shares how he has learned to resist forcing too much of his own life experiences into a performance, so as not to make it an exercise in what he calls \"purge acting.\"PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorWill some people have hurt feelings if you decline their invitations and delete their messages?

Unpopular minority faiths are like the proverbial canary in the mine: When they die, further violations of human life and dignity inevitably are coming.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteThere is no guarantee that what you do will yield what you want. The only guarantee is that as long as you are alive and conscious, you can respond to your circumstances in pursuit of your goals. Response-ability is a direct expression of rationality and free will.
