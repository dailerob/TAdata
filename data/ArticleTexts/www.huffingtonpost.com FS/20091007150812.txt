{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOMy first pick for the HuffPost Book Club is In Praise of Slowness, a terrific book by Carl Honore about the need for a more balanced existence. I first read it a couple of years ago when, exhausted from working too much and eating and sleeping too little, I fainted, hit my head on my desk, broke my cheekbone, and ended up with five stitches over one eye. It brought to mind my mother, who was a towering, lifelong example of the joys and benefits of slowness. I\u0027m recommending the book not because I\u0027ve mastered its lessons, but because I need its message reinforced. It turns out that, not surprisingly, slowness can\u0027t be mastered quickly.
