Two very different men, but they shared the same defining qualities that we need in the 21st century. As Nancy Koehn put in the conclusion of her speech at the Aspen Ideas Festival: \"We need muscles of moral courage, we need to flex them, we need to find them, we need to help others recognize them and find them in themselves. Nothing more is needed and nothing less will do at this moment of great turbulence, great promise, great peril.\"Comments (24)Shinz? Abe96th Prime Minister of Japan, President of the Liberal Democratic PartyWe are committed to build a robust Japan that will continue to foster and preserve global commons, and contribute to the peace and stability of the world. In 20 years time, we will marvel at how much Japan has changed.Comments (52)Connie PillichMember of the Ohio House of RepresentativesSome politicians in Ohio have explicitly said their goal is to make our state more like Texas. So there\u0027s a great irony that, just as one brave woman in Austin was standing up to protect reproductive health choices for women, men here in Columbus were plotting ways to take them away.Comments (597)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The official reason given for delaying the Affordable Care Act\u0027s mandate that employers provide insurance coverage or face fines, is that employers need more time to implement it. The unofficial reason has more to do with the GOP\u0027s incessant efforts to bulldoze the law.Comments (436)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundAnger and jealousy do not last forever, but a gunshot fired in an impulsive rage often does. Easy accessibility to lethal guns makes a fatal difference over and over again.Comments (133)Derek PenwellAuthor; Editor; Speaker; ActivistLiberal Christians aren\u0027t liberal in spite of the Bible, but because of it. They don\u0027t pursue justice for LGBT people because they haven\u0027t read Scripture, but precisely because they have.Comments (1,063)Mark SissonFormer elite marathoner and triathlete; Author, \u0027The Primal Blueprint\u0027So you wanna put on some lean muscle mass. And you want to do it within the context of the Primal Blueprint, but aren\u0027t sure where to start. It\u0027s a common question and it\u0027s about time I addressed it head on.Comments (26)Marissa HigginsWriter4. \"Who\u0027s the guy in your relationship?\"Ouch. Some aspects of the patriarchy simply don\u0027t apply in same-sex relationships, and someone having to be \"the guy\" in a lesbian relationship is one of them.Comments (183)Amy EphronAuthorDear Edward Snowden, I\u0027m not sure what your end-game is or who appointed you to be a one-man band.Comments (450)Timothy KarrCampaign Director, Free Press and SavetheInternet.comWhile Nixon broke the law to attack dissenting voices, Obama has distorted it to the same effect. And he\u0027s taken his powers much, much further -- misinterpreting outdated or poorly written laws to claim his administration\u0027s authority to spy on almost anyone who uses modern technology to communicate.Comments (544)Susan CainAuthor, New York Times Bestseller \u0027QUIET: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can\u0027t Stop Talking\u0027When people think you\u0027re trying to influence them, they put their guard up. But when they feel you\u0027re trying to help them, or to muse your way to the right answer, or to be honest about your own imperfections, they open up to you. They hear what you have to say.CommentsRalph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorIn an age of increased jingoism about freedom and American ideals, the comparative yardsticks of patriotism should be applied frequently and meticulously to the large U.S. corporations that rove the world seeking advantages from other countries, to the detriment of the United States.Comments (86)Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOThose who don\u0027t pay much attention to Egypt would be forgiven for thinking that the images dominating their television sets these days are simply a replay of the popular revolution that overthrew President Mubarak two and a half years ago. They are not.Comments (235)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027What do I love about America? I love the land. I love our many diverse cultures. I especially love our best national values: freedom, opportunity, community, justice, human rights, and equality under the law for all of our citizens of every race, creed, culture, and genderCommentsCesar MillanFounder of the Cesar Millan FoundationWhen the fireworks are going off this year, pay attention to how your dogs react, and which of these techniques help the most. Make notes, then plan ahead for next year. July 5th is the best day to start the process of preparing your dog for next year\u0027s festivities.Comments (11)Abdelhadi FarajPrisoner number 329 at Guantanamo BayThis is my call to the outside world from behind these rusty bars, in this monstrous cell. The past few months have been among the harshest lived by the prisoners here. Does the world know what is happening in this prison?Comments (583)Vivian Diller, Ph.D.Psychologist and author, \u0027Face It\u0027The \u0027midlife crisis\u0027 has served as fodder for many a Judd Apatow movie, but the reality of the experience is anything but funny.Comments (41)FoodbeastIndependence Day in America is one of those rare holidays that doesn\u0027t seem to exist just to make people buy things. It\u0027s about eating well, sitting back and enjoying each other\u0027s company. Except when it\u0027s not...CommentsElyse CherryCEO, Boston Community CapitalThere are two popular myths about why the foreclosure crisis -- which continues to tear apart communities across the country -- cannot be solved. Both are wrong.CommentsJennifer BoykinSpeaker and Creator of LifeAfterTampons.comI\u0027ve made EVERY ONE of these mistakes myself -- REPEATEDLY -- and they are the main reasons why it took me TWENTY YEARS to make my biggest Unrequited Dream a reality.Comments (54)Meghan RalstonHarm Reduction Coordinator, Drug Policy AllianceTuesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a report about the rate of opioid and prescription drug overdose among women in the United States. It\u0027s bad, and getting worse. But not getting much attention.CommentsMike RyanSenior Entertainment Writer, The Huffington PostFor the life of me, I just can\u0027t figure out whom this movie is for, which is why I find it so fascinating. Before I saw the movie, I just assumed it would be for kids. It is not for kids. (At my screening, I witnessed wary adults lead a mass exodus of children after the villain slices out the heart of a still living human being, then takes a bite.)Comments (998)Macrina Cooper-WhiteAssociate Editor, HuffPost ScienceThe new Seminary Ridge Museum at Gettysburg, which opened its doors to the public on July 1 in commemoration of the battle\u0027s 150th anniversary, highlights the untold stories of the people who tended to the wounded in the American Civil War.CommentsJordan SchultzThe Huffington Post\u0027s sports columnist, The Schultz ReportLA Lakers: Howard has made it clear that he doesn\u0027t want to be a pick-and-roll big man, which is odd considering that over the past three seasons, he\u0027s ranked 99th, 99th and 96th in finishing as a roller, per Synergy Sports.CommentsDrew Ramsey, M.D.Assistant Clinical Professor of Psychiatry, Columbia University and New York State Psychiatric InstituteMy ultimate measure of a food is its power to support brain health, and it is clear that more kale in your diet means a happier, healthier, sexier you -- all the basic signs that your brain is running well.Comments (289)Alex ZhavoronkovDirector, Biogerontology Research FoundationThere are several megatrends and specific technology trends already in the making, and they will undoubtedly make us live significantly longer than our parents and grandparents.Comments (126)David MednicoffDirector, Middle Eastern Studies, UMass-AmherstFollowing perhaps the largest national protest in global history, an enormous, diverse group of Egyptians awaits the political results of the rapid erosion of legitimacy of the government of Mohammed Morsi whom they elected very narrowly one year ago.Comments (44)Kirk DouglasActorI\u0027ve lived a long time. Almost 97 years. I\u0027ve seen a lot of fear-mongering, bigotry and discrimination. But now I\u0027m also seeing a modern generation of children who view the world very differently than their parents and grandparents.Comments (881)Julie HyzAuthorCooking mysteries, murders set in cheese shops, even bee-keeping mysteries are relentlessly devoured by rabid fans, and publishers keep them coming. What makes this genre so popular? Why are readers choosing amateur sleuths over cops? Humor over violence?CommentsJoanna MontgomeryWife, mother, writer, survivorWhile buying all of your groceries at a store like Whole Foods could potentially break the bank (I love you, WF, and visit your establishment at least once a week, but you are crazy expensive), there are other, less costly options.Comments (15)Jamie KrugCMO - Chief Medical Officer (of my family), SAHM, OurStrokeOfLuck.netI have grieved for myself, for the life I could have had. For the woman I could have been. But I have never grieved for the child I was going to have. Because I have Owen.
