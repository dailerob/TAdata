{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"In the weeks leading up to the Republican and Democratic conventions, we had countless meetings, conference calls and epic email threads geared toward finding solutions to our country\u0027s ongoing jobs crisis. And I\u0027m delighted to announce that today we launch JobRaising, one of the initiatives that grew out of those discussions. Along with the Skoll Foundation, CrowdRise, and knowledge partner McKinsey, JobRaising will help job-creating nonprofits raise money, raise awareness and help put Americans back to work. The Skoll Foundation has committed $250,000 to a challenge that will fund the most creative and innovative ideas from nonprofits working to create jobs. If you\u0027re involved with a nonprofit, you can apply here. If you\u0027re not, but want to help expand the search for solutions to the jobs crisis, check back to see featured nonprofits that are creating jobs and pledge your support to those whose missions resonate with you.Read Post | Comments (13)Robert Kuttner, 09/30/12Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The other image Brown has carefully pursued is that of the last moderate Republican standing.

If significantly fewer than 96,000, Mitt Romney has the more credible claim that the economy isn\u0027t improving.Read Post | Comments (54)Rob Goodman and Jimmy Soni, 09/29/12Stoicism still has a tremendous amount to teach us, especially in these passion-saturated times.
