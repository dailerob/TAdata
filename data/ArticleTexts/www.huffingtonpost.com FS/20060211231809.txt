{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"From franciscan.orgFrom news.aol.comFrom newseum.orgAnother week, another episode of our least favorite long-running political soap opera, Desperate Democrats. In the latest installment, Democratic leaders decide to have an all-out, full blown identity crisis. On the front page of the New York Times. Above the fold. The article reads like a Saturday Night Live sketch. Except the only ones laughing will be Republicans. The most disturbing aspect of the piece is the fact that Democrats are still iffy about the importance of taking on Bush and the GOP on national security. Are there really Democrats still \"arguing that the party should focus only on domestic issues and run away from national security\"? Say it isn\u0027t so!READ POST | comments (80)02.08.2006 Jeralyn MerrittThe President continues to tell us that those held at Guantanamo are the \"worst of the worst.\" A new and statistical report tells a different story.READ POST | comments02.07.2006 Joe FontaineTim Russert, thank you for taking time to address my concerns during your visit to Ripon College. But you have still not addressed many other questions regarding your involvement in the case.READ POST | comments02.08.2006 Max ClelandOn the Mall in Washington D.C. this morning I had the opportunity to introduce 40 remarkable candidates for the United States Congress to a terrific gathering of supporters and the press corps.READ POST | comments (34)02.08.2006 Katrina vanden HeuvelAs a concept, compassionate conservatism--combining big tax cuts with big government spending--was always pure snake oil. Well, it\u0027s morning in America and compassion is out, callousness is in.READ POST | comments (11)02.08.2006 Rep. Sherrod BrownWhat America witnessed yesterday was evidence of a lifetime commitment to equality, respect, and truth. What better way to honor her than speaking out at an event celebrating her life? It was a defining American moment.READ POST | comments (15)02.08.2006 RJ EskowThe idea to run these cartoons was a bad one. But everybody\u0027s pushing their own agenda. Now that the controversy\u0027s turned into full-scale chaos, everybody\u0027s jumping at the chance to use it for themselves.READ POST | comments (15)02.08.2006 Steve BenenBush and his vaunted political machine seem to have embraced a new strategy that might boost the president\u0027s poll numbers: tie Bush directly to Bill Clinton. At this point, the approach is about as subtle as a sledgehammer.READ POST | comments02.08.2006 Ari MelberNewspapers don\u0027t usually publish obituaries of people who are still alive. But The New York Times just published an article attempting to write the Democrats\u0027 political obituary for November 2006.READ POST | comments02.08.2006 Marty KaplanRepublicans love playing the civility card. I wonder where these Emily Posts were when the Pentagon lied about the circumstances of Pat Tillman\u0027s death at his funeral. I don\u0027t recall them denouncing Pat Robertson -- while the towers were still smoldering.READ POST | comments (146)02.08.2006 Rep. Harold Ford, Jr.It is important remember we cannot divorce the way she lived her life from the way we celebrate her after her passing. Funerals should not be ceremonies to fabricate a life\u0027s works.READ POST | comments (50)02.08.2006 Glenn GreenwaldOpponents must agree on a limited set of clear, focused and principled points, and then activate every instrument of public persuasion which exists, and invent new ones which do not exist, to convey the formulated argument in a coordinated fashion.READ POST | comments (38)02.07.2006 Nora EphronChris Matthews is a perfect example -- although obviously exaggerated -- of what happens to men in the presence of Senator McCain. They lose their minds.READ POST | comments (195)02.08.2006 Michael ShawBecause the mannequin-like Laura has worked plenty hard cultivating a facade of grace and propriety, people don\u0027t customarily think of her as surly.READ POST | comments (88)02.08.2006 Steve ClemonsI have confirmed that the McCain office essentially ignored Jarecki for months, despite calls, a mailed DVD of the film, and various interactions as Jarecki had hoped to involve McCain in the roll-out of the film (figuring that he would like it).READ POST | comments (35)02.08.2006 Robert ScheerLike the Cold War before it, the \"war on terror\" is a conveniently sweeping rationale for all manner of irrational governance, such as the outrageous $2.77 trillion budget the president proposed to Congress on Monday.READ POST | comments (61)02.08.2006 Jane HamsherIt grows ever more apparent that Time Magazine\u0027s hands are exceptionally dirty here, joining NBC, the New York Times and the Washington Post in the Plame Hall of Shame.READ POST | comments (18)02.08.2006 Hooman MajdNot all the cartoons fall into the inappropriate or racist category, but one or two certainly do. That\u0027s where the problem lies, and it is for those cartoons in particular that the newspapers should apologize.READ POST | comments (64)02.08.2006 Bob BurnettThe real controversy begins when the NSA computer software makes the algorithmic decision to go \"fishing\" in my personal data.READ POST | comments (19)02.07.2006 Jonathan TasiniWith Wal-Mart rating as public enemy number one among many liberals, progressives and just regular voters, Clinton is finding her past ties to Wal-Mart too hot to handle so, presto, over the side the Beast of Bentonville must go.READ POST | comments (29)02.08.2006 Danny MillerNot that there\u0027s anything wrong with youthful beauty, but don\u0027t you agree that the lines and textures on Liv Ullmann\u0027s face today allow for greater expression as an actress and a person than the blank slate of her once-perfect complexion?READ POST | comments (16)AP/Mark J.
