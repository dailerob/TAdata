{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AFPFrom borat.kzDuring the roundtable segment on Sunday\u0027s Meet the Press, Tim Russert turned to David Broder and Eugene Robinson, both with the Washington Post, and asked them what\u0027s going on at the Post in light of the Bob Woodward revelation. To my delight and surprise, Broder and Robinson did not respond like good company men, but spoke of \"consternation\" and “embarrassment.” It was a great opportunity for Tim to look at the broken conventions regarding confidential sources and the broken trust between the public and the press. But instead, he went right back to the old protect-your- sources playbook. Stunning though it may seem, Russert really believes that the main problem raised by Judy Miller\u0027s and Bob Woodward\u0027s roles in Plamegate is how does the press repair the damage done between journalists and anonymous sources? Talk about missing the forest for the trees.READ POST | comments (70)11.28.2005 Nora EphronI can’t believe that it falls to me to explain Bob Woodward. I can’t believe it for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that I don’t speak to Bob Woodward and Bob Woodward doesn’t speak to me.READ POST | comments (46)11.28.2005 Marty KaplanCunningham is the tip of an iceberg.
