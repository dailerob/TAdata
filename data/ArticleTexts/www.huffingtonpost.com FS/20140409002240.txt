The 192,000 pace of job growth for the month was better than the prior two months when weather slowed growth, but the 178,000 three month average is certainly nothing to be happy about. At this pace the economy will not return to anything resembling full employment until 2020.

Due to the ACA, workers who have jobs they dislike can quit and look for a better job without worrying about losing insurance coverage.Equal Pay Day isn\u0027t just about recognizing an unequal paycheck.

It\u0027s the fear of not being able to afford a place to live. It\u0027s the fear of not being able to go to the doctor, buy medicine, or put gas in the car.
