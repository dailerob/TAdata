{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"You know it’s been a bad run for the president when the Miers fiasco isn’t close to the worst news he got this week. Miers’ withdrawal, the 2,000th military death in Iraq, and, oh, yeah, the indictment of Scooter Libby. Catch up on some of the week\u0027s best HuffPost blogs below, as well as Libby/Plamegate takes from Lawrence O\u0027Donnell, David Corn, Stephen Schlesinger, Trey Ellis, Katrina vanden Heuvel, Jeralyn Merritt, RJ Eskow, Nathan Gardels, and Tim Naftali. Plus Danielle Crittenden’s latest Secret IM Session. And don’t forget to take the “Lucky Sperm Club” Quiz!READ POST | comments (40)10.30.2005 Lawrence O\u0027DonnellAs long as Rove stays in the White House doing the terrible job he is doing and bringing the stench of scandal with him every time he walks in the door, the Bush presidency will remain a powerless gang that couldn’t shoot straight.READ POST | comments (48)10.28.2005 Al FrankenIt isn\u0027t a one-day holiday like Fitzmas. This could go on and on. One day a great gift like Libby, the next day a pair of socks (Ari Fleischer), the next day, who knows: maybe an Xbox 360 (Karl Rove)!READ POST | comments (123)10.28.2005 Paul BegalaAs a former Clinton aide, the indictment of Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby gives me no schadenfreude. But it\u0027s telling that the first time anyone had the courage to scratch the surface of Bush, Inc., he found corruption.READ POST | comments (156)10.28.2005 Ari EmanuelHe’s brilliant, courageous, clearly a real leader. Why isn’t Pat Fitzgerald our next Supreme Court nominee?READ POST | comments (16)10.29.2005 Jay RosenThere was a break today in the silence that had fallen over the New York Times editorial page in the matter of Judith Miller. ...READ POST | comments (28)10.28.2005 Tina BrownThe letter Libby wrote Judith Miller was not a message in code meant to influence Miller\u0027s legal strategy. It was the voice of Libby the novelist...already turning his thoughts to how his life would change after his career ended with an indictment.READ POST | comments (29)10.24.2005 Alec BaldwinMy question for today is: Why are contemporary Republicans so full of shit?READ POST | comments (394)10.28.2005 David MametREAD POST | comments (18)10.27.2005 Arianna Huffington\"Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, creeps in this petty pace from day to day, to the last syllable of recorded time.\" Can you think of a more perfect summing up of the position Bush now finds himself in?READ POST | comments (149)10.28.2005 Rep. John ConyersI have directed my staff to conduct a comprehensive investigation -- not only of alleged efforts to misuse the White House to out a CIA operative, but all legal violations and breaches of trust by the administration concerning the war.READ POST | comments (111)10.25.2005 Michael SmerconishBono made the humanitarian case for addressing debt, AIDS, trade and Africa, but he also put forth a bold argument based on national security.READ POST | comments (16)10.28.2005 Marty KaplanThe media love meta. For them, it\u0027s sexy to speculate about a pre-emptive pardon, but it\u0027s wonky to actually investigate a pre-emptive war.READ POST | comments (19)10.25.2005 Patt MorrisonA spokesman for the U.S. command called the 2,000 figure an \"artificial mark on the wall.\" We put marks on the wall to remember how tall our children were, and how tall they have become. The marks always get higher, never lower. The death toll will only grow.READ POST | comments (12)10.24.2005 Laurie DavidSen. Ted Stevens of Alaska threatened to resign if the $450 million allocated in the new transportation bill for his pet project was redirected to help with post-Katrina reconstruction. So much for compassionate conservatism.READ POST | comments (31)10.27.2005 Melinda HennebergerBoth of these smart, capable women were undone not by powerful men but by their own over-reliance on their relationships with them.READ POST | comments (19)10.28.2005 Harry ShearerFor months, it\u0027s been standard talking point fodder that the Administration didn\u0027t rely on the forged documents. That\u0027s why Friday\u0027s NYT story is noteworthy.READ POST | comments10.26.2005 Jane HamsherThey\u0027ve tried to argue that this was all Cheney\u0027s doing, but I don\u0027t buy it. This wasn\u0027t the kind of thing Rove needed to \"protect\" Junior from. It\u0027s the kind of dirty, junior high politics that former \"loyalty enforcer\" Dubya delights in.READ POST | comments (53)10.28.2005 Deepak ChopraIf the war-makers aren\u0027t held to account for their lies and deceptions, democracy will suffer a terrible blow.READ POST | comments (11)10.29.2005 Bob CescaYou\u0027re in a tight spot, Scooter. Either you make your case in a trial, thus exposing the administration to sweet, sweet humiliation, or you plead guilty. So I say: press on. Don\u0027t give in to the White House \"pleamongers\".READ POST | comments (16)10.29.2005 Jim LampleyWhew!
