{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, the nation watched as the Republican Party continued its awkward attempt to pretend Donald Trump is something other than a dangerous buffoon. On Thursday, Trump met with Paul Ryan, with the two calling the talk a \"positive step toward unification,\" and Ryan adding that Trump is a \"very warm and genuine person.\" If Ryan ends up endorsing Trump, he must be held accountable for what he\u0027s endorsing. As Senator Harry Reid said of his GOP counterpart, \"Since Sen. McConnell has so enthusiastically embraced Trump, you can only assume he agrees with Trump\u0027s view that women are dogs and pigs.\" Rough stuff but he has a point: You either believe we should deport 12 million people or you don\u0027t. You either believe there should be a religious test to enter the U.S. or you don\u0027t. But the GOP isn\u0027t alone in its attempts to white-wash Trump. The New York Times referred to Trump\u0027s racism as \"a reductive approach to ethnicity.\" This is how someone like Trump can actually get to the White House in 2016: because of the reluctance -- by political leaders and the media -- to call out racism when they see it.When we ask \"Who rules the world?\" we commonly adopt the standard convention that the actors in world affairs are states, primarily the great powers, and we consider their decisions and the relations among them. That is not wrong. But we would do well to keep in mind that this level of abstraction can also be highly misleading.Institute Professor emeritus, MIT Department of Linguistics and Philosophy; Author, \u0027Who Rules the World?\u0027With nearly 10,000 boomers retiring each day, a profoundly different portrait of retirement leisure is beginning to emerge -- which many retirees tell us is the most liberating and enjoyable time of their lives. And, as I\u0027ll explain, money doesn\u0027t seem to be the primary key to enjoying leisure in retirement.Gerontologist, psychologist, author, entrepreneur and public speakerLowry/Alter/Green debate if Trump\u0027s chances are 40%/20%/or 5% based on his AmericaFirst meta-argument vs. his lunacy.

They get in your wallpaper. They get in your rugs, in your upholstery, and your clothes, and finally in to you.\"Veteran journalist reporting from the United NationsThere\u0027s an eerie silence about the other major climate change threat, which might lower Earth\u0027s average surface temperature by 7°C: a decade-long mini ice age caused by a U.S.-Russia nuclear war.MIT physicist, author of \"Our Mathematical Universe\"Super artist, mediocre humble braggerA lot of people make the mistake of thinking that they can only damage their careers by making one huge misstep, but the reality is that it\u0027s usually not that dramatic.Author of #1 bestselling book, Emotional Intelligence 2.0, and president of TalentSmart, world\u0027s leading provider of emotional intelligence.It is unfortunate that we were able to book with ease in the past and a simple profile picture change seems to have caused us much trouble.

Let\u0027s make sure that this union, this movement, and the leaders we elect are truly representative of our people. And we will carry their dreams together.Chair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusMaybe he cares so little about learning about what the GI Bill is, because he cares so little about veterans. Most of the money he raised \"for veterans,\" when he bailed on a Republican debate, still hasn\u0027t been given to veterans\u0027 groups.Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranHundreds of cities and town across the nation are losing money protecting Wal-Mart\u0027s merchandise. It\u0027s just another example of public welfare for America\u0027s richest family.Founder, Sprawl-BustersThe President\u0027s order to fight an unauthorized war requires conscientious military members to violate their oath to \"support and uphold the Constitution,\" which by extension requires them to disobey orders that are unconstitutional. Herein lies the crux of my brother Nathan\u0027s case.Professional musician residing in the San Francisco areaThe president must do more than give another passionate speech about nuclear disarmament. The world needs -- indeed, is desperate for -- concrete action.Senior Scientist and Co-Director of the Global Security Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists.Senior Scientist and Co-Director, Global Security Program, Union of Concerned ScientistsWhen I use the word character I\u0027m referring specifically to the behaviors, actions and words displayed by an individual over a period of time. And based on Azealia Banks\u0027 character, I can no longer support her, black girl or not.Mom, educator, activist, performance artist, step \u0026 dance teacher, model and writerI\u0027m not sure Donald Trump has the personal conviction to be a racist. He just sells racism -- and that\u0027s worse. Trump\u0027s racial, religious, and gender bigotry will lose him many religious Americans, including those whom the media has often called \"values voters.\"Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersAfter watching your incredible performance Monday night coming off a tough injury, I felt compelled to openly praise your extraordinary accomplishments, your indomitable spirit and the lessons you are teaching millions of young people.Ranking Member, Senate Environment and Public Works CommitteeSupporters of the law are inventing a problem where none exists, and creating fear and hysteria in order to drum up support for their cause. And for people like North Carolina\u0027s Governor Pat McCrory to use this issue for political purposes: It is outrageous, vile and a sad testament to how low politicians will go to maintain power.President, National Action NetworkAs a child I hated not being allowed into the segregated library in my hometown. But I am honored and grateful that today the Marlboro County Public Library -- the Marian Wright Edelman Library in Bennettsville, SC -- provides a panoply of early childhood and adult literacy programs.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundToday, yes today, the United States of America maintains the largest system of immigrant detention camps of any nation on the planet. Not North Korea, not Yemen, not the People\u0027s Republic of China, but us. The People of the United States. Have we not learned our lesson?Former Governor of Maryland and Mayor of BaltimoreNorth Carolina isn\u0027t the only state coming up with creative and unique ways to dehumanize and discriminate against an entire segment of the population. There are a half a dozen other states who have passed or are working on passing laws that allow their citizens to \"praise Jesus\" by treating His children like \"the least of these\"... and I don\u0027t want North Carolina to get all the credit for being the best \"Christians.\"Democratic candidate for U.S. Representative of North Carolina\u0027s 2nd Congressional DistrictOthers have decried the barely veiled bribery which buys not just access, but outcomes. But only Sanders has done this with the clarity and ferocity that the issue deserves. The damage is not simply that money buys power, but that hanging out with wealthy donors distorts an officeholder\u0027s sense of the world.Novelist and contributing opinion writerThe pain and torment which affects me and tens of millions of others is occurring in the South American nation of Venezuela, one which has tightened the noose around its neck over the last two decades with bad policy after bad policy.Florida Gator \u0026 Founder of ALRAS Academics, IncAll across this country women are being turned away because hospitals are allowing religion to take precedence over medical standards of care.
