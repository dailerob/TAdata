{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, President Obama pushed back against his natural allies in civil rights groups and teachers\u0027 unions who have criticized his education policies -- particularly his Race to the Top initiative -- as anti-teacher and unfair to minorities. \"Our goal isn\u0027t to fire or admonish teachers,\" he said. \"Our goal is accountability.\" Teacher effectiveness is the single most important factor driving student performance.

This is what real, beyond-left-and-right bipartisanship looks like.Read Post | CommentsGov. Jennifer M.
