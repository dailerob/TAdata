The Alabama legislature passed an immigration law that makes Arizona\u0027s law look almost tame and the results are taking a huge toll.Read Post | Comments (352)Earl Ofari Hutchinson, 10/14/11Author and political analystThough still unlikely, Herman Cain\u0027s quick rise to the top of the GOP presidential candidate heap makes Cain versus Obama now at least thinkable. This head-to-head would give voters the sharpest contrast in living political memory.Read Post | Comments (159)Jonathan Askin, 10/14/11Professor, Brooklyn Law SchoolThe digital natives who can imagine alternative \"What If\" worlds have come to Wall Street with frustrations over the existing political/corporate structures and processes, and are trying to re-imagine a better world.Read Post | Comments (188)Donna Karan, 10/14/11Fashion designerIf you want to see the soul of a culture, look at its art.Read Post | CommentsMark Shriver, 10/14/11Senior Vice President for Save the Children\u0027s U.S. ProgramsOne of the lessons we\u0027ve learned from No Child Left Behind, like many other federal laws, is that it was disproportionately weighted toward the needs of suburban and urban kids and left far too many children in rural school districts, well, behind.Read Post | Comments (39)Dr. Joel Hoffman, 10/14/11Speaker, author and Bible scholarUnfortunately, etymology, internal structure, and cognates are the three pillars of Bible translation.
