{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Greetings from India, where I\u0027m thrilled to announce we\u0027re launching our latest international edition, in collaboration with The Times of India Group and its digital arm, Times Internet (TIL). Beyond its 1.24 billion people, India is vast in every way -- its history, its colors, its food, its spiritual traditions, the billions of stories of its people, its contradictions. And without question India is facing huge and unique challenges -- from poverty and sanitation to sexual violence and endemic corruption. But India has unique resources to meet all these challenges. It\u0027s in looking back to its ancient traditions that have been exported around the world that so much of the wisdom and strength needed to build the future will be found. And I\u0027m thrilled that HuffPost India will be there to chronicle this story and -- just as important -- help Indians tell their stories themselves.When President Obama returns to India this January, he will become the first U.S. president to celebrate Republic Day as chief guest. As the leaders of the largest and oldest democracies in the world sit side-by-side along the Rajpath, it will be the surest sign yet that our interests and values are united like never before.U.S. Secretary of StateYou can think of many adjectives to describe The Huffington Post and it almost always will be accurate for India as well -- vibrant, diverse, feisty, inclusive, wise and fun.Editor-in-Chief, HuffPost IndiaIt is scarcely believable to imagine a world without elephants, rhinos, lions or tigers. Yet time is running out to save these creatures from being consigned to the history books and to stories of days gone by.Duke of Cambridge and President of United for WildlifeThe reason Democrats have pulled their punches with the financial sector for years is because it\u0027s hard to punch the hand that feeds you. This must stop. America can\u0027t tackle widening inequality without confronting the power and privilege lying behind it.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Until we engage with all sides, no matter how regressive their attitude, we will never make a breakthrough in attitudes towards women.Bestselling English language novelist in IndiaSo here we are, approaching Christmas 2014. Racism still taints the American dream. And unlike, say, in 1964 when there was a sense of a movement on the march with history on its side, it is hard to summon up optimism.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027One thing I\u0027ve come to realize over a few cycles of depression is this: depressed people don\u0027t need you to empathize; they just need you. A depressed person would rather have you say all the worst possible things, rather than not have you at all.Blogger (\u0027Under Reconstruction\u0027), artist, aspiring special educator.I fear that the dubious claims by this latest report simply complicate prospects for having the very important and necessary conversation about what measures California will need to take to deal with what is likely to be a steadily worsening water crisis. That is no small matter.Director of Penn State Earth System Science Center; Author of \u0027Dire Predictions\u0027 and \u0027The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars\u0027Something felt terribly wrong. At first I was just a little woozy. Five minutes later I threw up Taco Del Mar all over the locker room floor, and then had the unfortunate aim of collapsing in it. It was clear that this was unlike any concussion I had received in my past.StudentLast time I checked, people in relationships, whether new or established, want to see their partners. This phenomenon can be nearly impossible while juggling work deadlines.Associate creative director, animal lover, reader, runner and a Brooklyn girl by birth—and at heart.No president in our nation\u0027s history has ever been castigated, condemned, mocked, insulted, derided, and degraded on a scale even close to the constantly ugly attacks on President Obama. From the day he assumed office -- indeed, even before he assumed office -- he was subjected to unprecedented insults in often the most hateful terms.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoIt is CEOs, not the working poor, who deserve public scorn for their dependence on government handouts. The parable of Charles Dickens\u0027 \"A Christmas Carol\" springs to mind.International President, United SteelworkersRubble. That\u0027s been the one constant for the Awajah family for as long as I\u0027ve known them. Four months ago, their home was demolished by the Israeli military -- and it wasn\u0027t the first time that Kamal, Wafaa, and their children had been through this.award-winning documentary filmmaker, authorThe parent who can come to me and sat they\u0027ve never offered their child anything as a reward for good behavior can show me their Parent of the Year certificate and I\u0027ll kiss it. I\u0027ll kiss it in my Santa boxers and my ugly Christmas sweater.Father of two and blogger at PuzzlingPosts.comIt\u0027s 2014, a black stormtrooper shouldn\u0027t be considered progress or pandering, it should be considered the norm. Still, there is definitely something striking and out of place about this stormtrooper that has nothing to do with the color of his skin.Blogger, Friendly Neighborhood FilmmakingThe founder and executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative, this activist, attorney and McArthur Genius Grant recipient has dedicated his life to fixing what many perceive as a broken justice system. He won the landmark Supreme Court case striking down life sentences for juveniles, just one issue he details in Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption.PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorIf you\u0027re like I used to be, you\u0027re skeptical that you\u0027ll actually make the lasting changes needed to get the health you desire. I know exactly how you feel. I\u0027ve jumped on the \"I\u0027m going to get healthy\" train more times than I\u0027d like to admit.Naturopathic Physician and VIRTUAL Health Consultant at www.DrDeborah.comIn the wake of the deaths of Michael Brown, Tamir Rice and Eric Garner, a substantial number of African Americans no longer believe that the police operating in their communities will treat them fairly and impartially. Against this reality, I believe the following proposals for action should be seriously considered.Diversity Visiting Professor, University of San Francisco; and Scholar Writer in Residence, MLK, Jr. Institute, Stanford UniversityMy last relationship was a gay, polyamorous, open, interracial threesome. (I know, very 2013.) In a time when gay couples are becoming remarkably mainstream, we were \"destroying the sanctity of gay marriage,\" I would often joke. Some didn\u0027t find it funny.Sings in the queer alt country band Indiana Queen.Stars in the web-series Three. Scorpio.This is a fight for the hearts and minds of Sunni Islam, in the region and worldwide. It is a fight that Muslims must lead, that Muslims must win.President, Fiscal Strategies GroupDear Ava, take your own journey and find a solution for the things that hold you back. Find your own weapon and don\u0027t forget to chase your dreams. Who says the world is safe and will be safe? But if you live like you own it, you will.Acclaimed ActorYou can talk all you want about being \"color blind,\" while still unconsciously assuming that middle class white lives are the standard against which all other lives are to be measured.Author; Editor; Speaker; ActivistA whole two years after the shocking Delhi gang rape, why have things not changed? If even such a horrific act could not change the situation, what will it take for India to adjust its attitude towards its women?Representative at UNFPA KenyaIf you don\u0027t give yourself enough time to sort through the options available to you, you might wind up paying your insurance company a lot more than necessary -- which is exactly what a lot of my former colleagues in the business are hoping for.Author, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgLearn how to properly store your groceries to keep food flavorful, save money on groceries, and reduce food waste.Registered Dietitian Nutritionist and Freelance WriterOur job is not done with putting them in great schools. Ours is an ongoing job of keeping the dialogue open, of sensitizing the children towards the other gender, of discussing our own feelings towards any form of violation that we might have faced or seen.Lecturer in PsychologyAs people begin to question the integrity of the Rolling Stone journalist who broke the UVA rape story, the veracity of the survivor, and whether this whole issue should ever have been raised in the first place, there are many lessons we can all learn as this story continues to unfold. We need to stand together against sexual violence.President of One in Four, Professor at Oklahoma State UniversityThe brutal flip side of this reductionist idea is the implication that if you\u0027re not at the five sigma level, your efforts, while admirable and even useful, will never be fodder for future memory or future textbooks -- that most of us are no more than worker bees.Senior Astronomer, SETI InstituteI\u0027m not saying that the Gun Control Act of 1968 is a perfect law. Far from it. But at the very least it does codify the idea that certain types of people simply should not be allowed to get access to guns.Mike the Gun GuyAstute diplomatic symbolism aside, the larger question is which Bhagavad Gita will prevail during the Modi Raj. The Prime Minister\u0027s personal background leads back to the Gita of RSS founder Hedgewar, who read the work as a conservative, exclusivist, Hindu work.Professor, Bard College.
