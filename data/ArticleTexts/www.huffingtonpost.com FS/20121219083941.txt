{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"On Sunday night, President Obama spoke at an interfaith service for the victims of the horrific elementary school shooting. Not surprisingly, it was a poignant and moving speech. But the sad, horrible, tragic fact is that none of what we are witnessing is surprising. Shocking, yes, but not surprising. Mass shootings have become a defining feature of modern America. Yet on the issue of gun violence, President Obama has shown a gift for eloquent rhetoric but no follow-through. What we need now is not another national conversation but action -- starting with a ban on the sale of weapons that are only good for mass murder. Will the president lead the way? Will Congress act? Or will we succumb to the fatalistic conventional wisdom that says we\u0027ll never be able to prevent this from happening again -- and again and again?Read Post | Comments (1,288)Jane Smiley, 12/18/12Pulitzer Prize-Winning Novelist and EssayistIt\u0027s pretty clear when you think about it that gun lovers have used the 2nd Amendment not only to threaten us, and in some cases to kill us, but also to mooch off of us -- they have their fun, and we pay. That part has got to stop. You can have your guns, but you have responsibilities.Read Post | Comments (1,348)Dan Whisler, 12.17.2012Environmental science teacherWhen I started teaching, I never would have thought that an automobile could become my classroom of the future. While at times it is hectic securing funding for our project and developing the resources and curriculum to go with it, I am happy to provide our students real-world opportunities not possible through any textbook.Read Post | Comments (6)Marlo Thomas, 12/18/12Award-winning actress, author and activistUgh -- December. Is there any month of the year that drives us quite so batty? Shopping. Entertaining. Traveling. Wrapping up that final workload. And all those holiday parties you promised you\u0027d go to! It\u0027s enough to make you want to start dipping into the eggnog a few weeks early.Read Post | Comments (23)Michael Roth, 12/17/12President, Wesleyan UniversityReasonable law aimed at reducing violent deaths. Is that too much to ask? We know there are policies that have worked elsewhere -- in Australia, Japan, Great Britain. We will be told that these places are very different from us, and they are. That is no excuse.Read Post | Comments (296)Jennifer Rowe Walters, 12/18/12Mother and preschool teacherWe know what six looks like. We know how it feels. How big it\u0027s getting.
