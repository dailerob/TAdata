{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorBoy, it\u0027s a whole different thing to talk about the housing market when it\u0027s looking up. President Obama went to Phoenix to talk housing yesterday, a locale no doubt motivated by the double-digit increases in home prices there in recent months. Of course, those gains are off an awfully low base as the state was slammed by the housing bust, but it is well established that the housing market is now reliably rising from the dead, which is pretty much where it was the last time he talked housing out there shortly after he was elected. However, there were a couple of interesting things that came out of the speech.Comments (69)Walter IsaacsonPresident and CEO, Aspen InstituteI\u0027ve noticed a few things about Jeff over the years. He thinks things through carefully. He\u0027s not impulsive. He\u0027s not driven by ego. He develops a strong theory of the case for every new endeavor.CommentsAnthony MelchiorriTravel Channel Host, Hotel Fixer, Hospitality Industry GuruLike any business, hotels have their secrets. And after spending more than 20 years working in and improving struggling hotels, I\u0027ve learned them all -- the good, the bad and the ugly. Now, just like I do on Travel Channel\u0027s \"Hotel Impossible\"each week, I\u0027m sharing my expertise with you.Comments (11)Jimmy McMillanFounder, The Rent Is Too Damn High PartyI said it once and I\u0027ll say it again: We\u0027re all freaky and Anthony Weiner just exposed his freaky-ism in the wrong way.Comments (81)Stephen FryBritish Actor, Writer, Lord of Dance, Prince of Swimwear \u0026 BloggerAn absolute ban on the Russian Winter Olympics of 2014 on Sochi is simply essential. Stage them elsewhere in Utah, Lillyhammer, anywhere you like. At all costs Putin cannot be seen to have the approval of the civilised world.Comments (834)Rachel Macy StaffordSpecial Education TeacherAlthough the words \"hurry up\" did little if nothing to increase my child\u0027s speed, I said them anyway. Maybe even more than the words, \"I love you.\" The truth hurts, but the truth heals... and brings me closer to the parent I want to be.Comments (191)Max Jacobson-FriedWriter, CrossFitterI\u0027m not sure when it happened, but at some point in my mid to late 20s, I reached a state of general malaise. I knew CrossFit had something to do with doing 100 pull ups and throwing up, which was a fancy stretch from my normal routine. I signed up for an Intro course and jumped right in.Comments (454)Morris W. O\u0027KellyHost of \"The Mo\u0027Kelly Show\" on KFI am640 and XM Satellite RadioWe\u0027re not in search of black faces repeating exactly what was said previously by the white ones. Trust me, we aren\u0027t. We\u0027re in search of meaningful inclusion and substantive competition for our votes on a policy level.Comments (371)Sarah KooimanBloggerDear Section 113, Row 17, Seat 22: Thank you for what you did for my son at Miller Park on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. You made my boy feel like a rockstar. You didn\u0027t have to. You chose to. And I am sincerely grateful to you for it.Comments (13)Mirabai HollandBoomer Fitness Expert, creator, Moving Free® TechniqueWe can\u0027t eliminate the stress. But we can relieve the fight-or-flight response that sends our bodies into danger mode. And we can cultivate a relaxation response over time that will reduce our physiological stress reaction.Comments (19)Mark WeisbrotCo-director, Center for Economic and Policy Research, Washington, D.C.What would U.S. foreign, military, and so-called \"national security\" policy look like if the media reported the most important facts about it?Comments (31)Jeff GuinnAuthorThere is far more to the life of Charles Manson than anyone could have imagined. Much of what has previously been believed isn\u0027t true.Comments (91)DJ Louie XIVDJAs a fan, am I obligated each every time this woman decides to go on tour, to drop the money to go see her just because she says it\u0027s time? When did entertainers, or actors or chefs or writers or DJs for the matter, get raised to this sanctified status?CommentsRichard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureWhy haven\u0027t any bankers gone to jail? What\u0027s going on in this country? Here are seven things about Wall Street crime and Washington \"justice\" you might have wanted to know, but were probably too depressed to ask.CommentsGreta Van SusterenHost, Fox News\u0027 \u0027On the Record With Greta Van Susteren\u0027The newspaper industry might have dodged the 8 ball if they had skipped the salons where they talk to each other and instead realized that they are a service industry (yes, like a lawn service or even cable news) and thus evolved to meet the needs of their customers.Comments (33)Bruce Ackerman and Ian AyresAlthough the Internet may have destroyed the newspaper\u0027s old business model, we can use it to create a new decentralized system that may generate an even more vibrant marketplace of ideas for the twenty-first century.Comments (44)Kevin McDonoughSyndicated columnist and television criticWith all due respect. You can write about anything. Putin and Obama just relaunched the Cold War and you\u0027ve devoted your column (\"Reince Is Right\") to the effects of a miniseries that hasn\u0027t been made on an election that\u0027s three years away.CommentsWilliam DietrichNovelist, Naturalist, Pulitzer Prize-winning JournalistInformation, after all, is an infinite as book titles. If Bezos can make its navigation easy, people will come. But can he afford the labor to tap it from meager newspaper revenues? We\u0027ll see.CommentsCyd ZeiglerCo-founder, Outsports.comWhile the Russians would love an American boycott of the Games, being banned from their own Games would help drive public sentiment. Instead of asking our athletes to carry messages that would fall on deaf ears, it would drive Russian Olympic hopefuls to speak out to their own government.CommentsConde Nast TravelerCondeNastTraveler.comWe sure do like our clichés in the States. In our annual Readers\u0027 Choice Survey, Southern hospitality shines on that \"friendliness\" front, while a total of five towns in the stereotypically brash Northeast earned spots on the mean-city list.Comments (1,937)David CoatesWorrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsThe only way in which to effectively push back this ever more carefully orchestrated Tea Party tide is to challenge Republican assertions and policies with the same degree of self-confidence and directness with which their advocates present them.Comments (966)Dr. Karin L. SmithsonPsychotherapist and spirituality expertAs college doors start to swish and swing open, slurping young people back in for fall classes, I feel compelled to put my hand up and say, \"Wait, you forgot something.\"Comments (438)Elliott NeginDirector of News \u0026 Commentary, Union of Concerned ScientistsDoes nine servings a day sound like a heavy lift? Well, consider this: If we ate just one more serving a day -- one banana or a large carrot -- we would save $5 billion annually in health care expenditures and prevent more than 30,000 heart-related deaths.Comments (38)Adam J. RoseHuffPost Standards EditorI don\u0027t know enough about hacking and odds are you don\u0027t, either. I set out to learn more at DEF CON, a hacking conference with enough discussions on civil liberties, ethics and philosophy to delight a liberal arts major. Charged to \"live an examined life,\" we should all think harder about our technology, privacy and security.Comments (15)Peter S. GoodmanExecutive Business Editor, The Huffington PostMaybe the deal signifies something much simpler and more hopeful for the state of American journalism: Perhaps Bezos thinks he can make money by producing and distributing consequential work.Comments (81)Michael RudermanStanford MBA, techno-optimist and \u0027Next Generation LGBT Leader\u0027Thousands of college students are finishing internships this month before heading back to their campuses. If you were one of those students lucky enough to land a selective internship at a top company, these last few days on the job are critical.CommentsCharles ClymerBlogger, student and Army veteranOn Monday, The Hillary Project began spamming reporters on Twitter with a link to a game in which visitors are encouraged to \"slap Hillary\" with the option of doing so after you a click a button that gives a prerecorded, vaguely-controversial sound bite from her long career in the public eye.Comments (121)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Instead of spending August on the beach, corporate lobbyists are readying arguments for when Congress returns in September about why corporate taxes should be lowered. But they\u0027re lies. You need to know why so you can spread the truth.Comments (1,812)Michael CalderoneSenior Media Reporter, The Huffington PostHow did the Times miss out on Washington Post sale scoop when profiling publisher?CommentsThrillistWe\u0027re a quick, free, daily e-mail ...Pizza. Even when it\u0027s bad, it\u0027s still pretty tasty, but when it\u0027s at its best, there are few things better.Comments (308)Deborah YaffeAuthorThese days, it seems, everyone\u0027s a Jane Austen fan. Who doesn\u0027t love the witty repartee of the sparring lovers in Pride and Prejudice -- you read it back in high school, right? -- or the date-night pleasures of the Emma Thompson movie made from Sense and Sensibility?Comments (74)Raymond J. LearsyAuthor, \u0027Ruminations on the Distortion of Oil Prices and Crony Capitalism\u0027There is no transparency whatsoever in the trading of oil on the commodity exchanges.
