{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOI was in the audience exactly a year ago when Mario Draghi, the well-respected president of the European Central Bank (ECB), made his now-famous \"whatever it takes\" remarks. Twelve months later, this stands out as the boldest and most successful initiative in the history of modern central banking. Yet the durability of the benefits is undermined by Europe\u0027s frustratingly slow progress in getting to grips with its growth and employment deficits. In celebrating the one-year anniversary, the West would be well advised to also think in terms of foregone opportunities. And we should constantly remember the millions of unemployed, the alarmingly high joblessness among the young, the struggles that too many face in securing their families wellbeing, and the growing number of retirees that are legitimately worried about their pensions.Comments (68)Neil HarbissonArtistI don\u0027t feel that I\u0027m using technology, I don\u0027t feel that I\u0027m wearing technology, I feel that I am technology. I don\u0027t perceive my antenna as a device, I perceive it as a part of my body, I perceive it as an organ.Comments (95)Bob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowUltimately, if we\u0027re going to engage in a debate about the NSA, certain people need to calm down and very carefully read everything that drops. It\u0027s a complicated issue that demands an even-keel and a clear understanding of what\u0027s being reported.Comments (707)Jason WhitlockColumnist, FOXSports.comHere\u0027s what the race-baiters on the right fail to comprehend: There\u0027s a clear-cut, easy-to-follow blueprint for avoiding the ravages of black-on-black violence and crime. America has yet to provide us a comparable blueprint for avoiding racial profiling.Comments (1,395)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarIf 50 percent of the American workforce is female, why isn\u0027t that reflected at the top? The follow up questions are: Should it be? Will it ever be?Comments (184)James ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Reviewing events unfolding from Iraq in the East to Lebanon in the West can give one the distinct feeling that the region is on a path leading to self-destruction. What, if anything, can be done to reverse course?Comments (113)Keli GoffAuthor and Special Correspondent, TheRoot.comIn this age of 24-7 paparazzi shots, most high profile new mothers hide out until they get their figures back into photo ready mode. But Middleton didn\u0027t do that, instead showing what a real mother\u0027s body looks like immediately after birth.Comments (246)William K. BlackAssoc. Professor, Univ. of Missouri, Kansas City; Sr. regulator during S\u0026L debacleIt is obscene that Holder promised not to torture Snowden, but the underlying obscenity is that the United States did torture suspects and Holder has refused to prosecute those who ordered and conducted the torture.Comments (231)Eddie ParsonsStyle ConsultantWindow shopping through the Meatpacking District of Manhattan there is one trend that every designer has opted for this season: \"Now Hiring\" signage. This is interesting to me because it seems as if the art of being a retailer is dying.Comments (18)Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoHow do we know when to abandon a successful policy? At first blush, this might seem a contradiction in terms. Why would one ever abandon a successful policy? But most policies have costs as well as benefits, and at a certain point one might decide that the costs outweigh benefits.Comments (14)Arianna HuffingtonIn this week\u0027s issue, against the backdrop of the Trayvon Martin case, the decision weakening the Voting Rights Act, and Detroit\u0027s bankruptcy, Howard Fineman looks at how far we still are from true equality for African-Americans.Comments (93)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe gun lobby has been enriching gun manufacturers at the expense of our children\u0027s safety for far too long. For years the National Rifle Association has blocked the truth and actively fought against the passage and enforcement of gun safety laws.Comments (190)Jill HerzigEditor in Chief, RedbookHow did we get to this ridiculous place, where losing the baby weight is a competitive sport followed by millions?Comments (66)Janet TavakoliPresident, Tavakoli Structured FinanceFund managers that invested with SAC must be quaking in their Guccis. Investors expected them to perform first-class due diligence before placing funds under Cohen\u0027s management. Yet serious questions have swirled around Cohen\u0027s trading practices for more than a decade.CommentsLarry StraussVeteran high school teacher and coach, writerI\u0027d never imagined blues like that -- upbeat and exquisite. It seemed somehow to give a nod to all of life\u0027s sadness without giving in to any of it.CommentsKevin WuYouTube Comedian, KevJumbaThe students in Nairobi had been learning English by watching my YouTube videos. Incredible. I accepted the challenge and two months later I was on a plane to Kenya to teach a class of 5th graders in Nairobi.Comments (15)Rosabeth Moss KanterProfessor, Harvard Business SchoolHuman nature allows us to think our way out of blindspots. Tribalism is muted by other human creations, such as diverse communities with complex structures and more universalistic values. We call that civilization.Comments (127)Shannon Bradley-CollearyAging vaintress, wife dominatrix, mom butler and humble author who is slightly mustachioedWe fell into empathy with each other. Our similar sadness cancelled out the differences in our backgrounds and temperaments -- and we had the ability to make each other laugh until we peed our pants.Comments (32)Greta Van SusterenHost, Fox News\u0027 \u0027On the Record With Greta Van Susteren\u0027President Obama and Press Secretary Carney are insensitive and wrong about the scandals. The scandals are not phony. They are real. If you want to talk phony, maybe these two gentlemen should check the mirror?Comments (350)Suzan Haskins and Dan PrescherInternationalLiving.com EditorsThinking about retiring overseas but concerned you might make a less-than-worthy choice because you can\u0027t afford to visit all the places on your wish list before you make your final decision?Comments (12)Mohammed FairouzComposerFor me, pitches, tones and keys are more than just about sympathetic vibrations, open strings and other technicalities of physics and orchestration. A pitch suggests a color and an atmosphere.CommentsMichael F. JacobsonExecutive Director, Center for Science in the Public InterestThe ingredient in question is carmine. It\u0027s a red dye extracted from the dried, pulverized bodies of the cochineal insect -- an unphotogenic arthropod native to Mexico and South America with a fondness for cactus. Dannon uses carmine in four flavors of Fruit on the Bottom yogurt.Comments (177)Laura FinkFounder, Fink \u0026 Hernandez Consulting, LLCMayor Bob Filner has admitted that he has \"failed to fully respect women\" and to having a \"monster\" inside him. He is facing lurid allegations of sexual harassment and possibly assault. Filner harassed me in 2005, when I was serving as his Deputy Campaign Manager.Comments (149)Rebecca WaltonFreelancer writer, agoraphobe, mental health awareness campaignerAfter talking with a fellow agoraphobic (James) on Twitter, we came up with an idea that would push this awareness even further. What if everyone could have their stories heard and shared? What if they could all receive that positivity? We wanted to create a Diaries of a Broken Mind style campaign but on a much grander scale.Comments (12)Rep. Charles RangelRepresentative from the 13th Congressional District in New YorkNovember 30, 1950, was a living nightmare. In the battle of Kunu-ri, more than 5,000 American soldiers were killed, wounded or taken as prisoners of war. Ninety percent of my unit was killed. Little did I know, back then, that we were stopping communism.Comments (36)Blake PageSpecial Assistant to the President, Military Religious Freedom Foundation\"Lack or loss of spiritual faith\" is included in a list of risk indicators for use by \"leaders at all levels\" to \"identify and address risky behavior or events that may lead to risky behavior, as soon as possible.\"Comments (681)Edward DorsonUnderwater photographer, ocean activist and authorDeplorably, all recent U.S. state and territorial gains in shark conservation are now on the chopping block.Comments (12)Chantal Sicile-KiraAuthor, \u0027A Full Life With Autism\u0027; Founder, AutismCollege.comOne morning Jeremy woke up with a big grin on his face. He spelled out on his letterboard, \"I dreamt I painted your personality and I have to say it was purple and very lively.\"Comments (14)Ariane ZurcherWriter \u0026 Blogger: Emma\u0027s Hope Book, Where Art \u0026 Life MeetShouldn\u0027t we accommodate all people whether the devices they use are to communicate -- eyeglasses to see, wheelchairs to move, hearing aids to hear, service animals to guide or calm or, as is the case with Neil Harbisson, the device he created to hear color?CommentsAmber TamblynWriterTell Gynoticians like Rick Perry, Trent Franks, Pat McCrory and the Pat McCrorys of women like representative Jodie Laubenberg and Marsha Blackburn that enough is enough: We aren\u0027t just coming for their laws, we\u0027re coming for their JOBS.Comments (529)Mark Brennan RosenbergAuthor, \u0027Blackouts and Breakdowns\u0027 and \u0027Eating My Feelings\u0027Five of the sexiest housekeepers you\u0027ve ever seen have been steaming up televisions all over the country this summer in Lifetime\u0027s new hit series Devious Maids.Comments (19)Jackie K.
