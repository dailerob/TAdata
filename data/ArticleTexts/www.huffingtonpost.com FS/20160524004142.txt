{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor of sociology, University of California at BerkeleyAs the primary season is nearing its end and Bernie Sanders\u0027s chances of winning a majority of pledged delegates are increasingly remote, the Sanders campaign has put forward a provocative argument: If Democrats truly wish to avoid a Trump presidency, they should nominate him rather than Hillary Clinton. There is an obvious philosophical problem: The candidate calling for a political revolution is now looking to unelected super delegates to overturn the will of the people, who have given Hillary Clinton a clear majority of both pledged delegates and the popular vote. Yet the question remains: Is Sanders correct that he is more likely than Hillary Clinton to keep Donald Trump out of the White House? At stake in this debate is not just the choice between Sanders and Clinton, but competing visions of the future of the Democratic Party.For years the National Rifle Association has maintained its stranglehold on national politics by convincing politicians that it is politically invincible. But now there is fresh evidence -- actual numbers -- that show the NRA is increasingly feeling the heat of Americans\u0027 shifting attitudes about gun violence prevention.Filmmaker, Brave New FilmsI had wondered what the co-creator of the recent Martin Scorsese-Mick Jagger HBO offering Vinyl was doing seemingly dishing dirt on our Glimmer Twins. Cohen had worked for the duo of Marty \u0026 Micky in the 90s and the co-creator credit appeared to be his belated going-away prize. Whether it was offered, deserved or seized is very hard to discern when the result is Vinyl.Managed and produced the Rolling Stones from 1963-1967Clearly, university administrators prefer student demands that can be coopted or absorbed into their current business model. Allowing the prevailing culture to define the parameters of their protest has left the burgeoning Millennial Movement in a precarious position.Professor of History and Coordinator of Latin American Studies at Salem State UniversityThroughout the Republican primaries, pundits and pollsters repeatedly told us he\u0027d peaked, that his most recent outrageous statement was his downfall, that he was viewed as so unlikeable he didn\u0027t stand a chance of getting the nomination. But in my travels around the country, I\u0027ve found many who support him precisely because of the qualities he\u0027s being criticized for having.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027PUMAs, for those who have forgotten the 2008 Democratic primary race, were the supposedly-numerous Hillary Clinton supporters who refused to back Barack Obama. The name stood for \"Party Unity My Ass!\" which was also their rallying cry. This year, they may be replaced by the \"Bernie Or Bust!\" crowd, or (to coin a neologism) the BOBs.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comThe Libertarian Party could play the spoiler role in 2016 for Donald Trump, just as Ralph Nader did in 2000, but this time helping to tip the election to the Democrat.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027We spend the first 18 years of our life learning English, math, science and history.

Why? Cuz you\u0027ve gotten over some stuff, you\u0027ve let go of some stuff, and you\u0027ve learned some stuff. You know what your politics are. You know how to demand a raise without getting defensive. You know you might not ever get a better time on your half marathon. .. but you also don\u0027t really care.Award-winning comic, actress, author, creative coach, and social activistNow that you\u0027ve won the endorsement of the National Rifle Assocation, will you dare to do or say anything that the NRA would not thoroughly approve?Writer, lecturer, Dartmouth Professor EmeritusWhen your intentions to make positive social change meet inevitable obstacles, don\u0027t just wait. Jaywalk if you can; break a window if you must; pick a lock.Founder and CEO, Share Our StrengthThe mark of true citizenship is importantly defined by how well you engage with, and relate to each other. It\u0027s about our obligations, service, and fidelity to one another.Senior Advisor to the President and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsPut simply, Trump\u0027s prejudicial attitudes toward women, minorities, and other groups or peoples he doesn\u0027t like don\u0027t mark him as exceptional, nor does his record of flip-flops on issues, as the American people have come to expect that politicians are basically liars.Writer, Professor, Retired Lt. Colonel, Air ForceMy first plane ride was on EgyptAir nearly 18 years ago was with my mom and sister, coming to America.Award-winning Egyptian American journalist and writerSanders -- and perhaps some of his supporters -- may well believe that it is necessary to destroy the village in order to save it. That, after all, is how revolutions start, and Bernie has been promising revolution.Author/Professor, Miami University, Oxford, OhioIf you\u0027re not familiar with Hyperloop One, consider what it would be like to travel on the ground at 760 mph (faster than a jet airplane).Chairman/CEO, XPRIZEWhen it comes to diversity, the hiring conversation is just the tip of the iceberg. Candidates evaluate workplace environments before they decide to apply, and they\u0027re free to swipe left if they don\u0027t like what they see. It\u0027s time for companies that are struggling with diversity to take a hard look at themselves.Feminist, writer, and messaging nerd.Your body is perfect, just as it is.

Because we know what happens when a stubborn, left-leaning candidate stands on principle complaining about persnickety party politics, and it isn\u0027t pretty.
