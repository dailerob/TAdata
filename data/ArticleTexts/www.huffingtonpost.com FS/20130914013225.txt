{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"George LakoffAuthor, \u0027The Political Mind,\u0027 \u0027Moral Politics\u0027 and \u0027Don\u0027t Think of an Elephant!\u0027The daily horrors in Syria are direct: shootings, bombings, gassings. When the media reports on \"Syria\" (as it should), it is reporting on the direct horrors. If \"Syria\" is the problem, the problem is the daily horrors, the 100,000 killed, the ongoing shootings and bombings, the persistent hatred and oppression. If the president is understood as addressing \"Syria,\" and he proposes directly bombing Syria, the natural question is whether that eliminates the daily direct horrors. When he admits that it does not, when Secretary Kerry says correctly, \"There are no good options in Syria,\" the question naturally arises, \"Why bomb when it won\u0027t solve the direct problem, but might create other problems?\" To President Obama, \"Syria\" is not primarily about direct causation. It is about systemic causation as it affects the world as a whole.Comments (181)Anas Aremeyaw AnasUndercover journalist and private eyeIn my TEDTalk, I tell the full story of how it all started. I look back on over 14 years of my undercover reporting. There have been high and low points, but one thing that remains is the kind of impact this kind of journalism brings.Comments (52)Bob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowIf your goal is to shame other organizations for violating your privacy rights, you\u0027d better make sure your house is in order because, in the final analysis, privacy is privacy.Comments (11)James CostosU.S. Ambassador Designate to SpainI am deeply committed to furthering the economic and foreign policies of the country we love.CommentsJenny IsenmanHumor columnist, Jen X\u0027pert, Jenny From the Blog at TheSuburbanJungle.comI wouldn\u0027t know a ton of things about pop culture, big hair or bad TV had I not been a poster child for Generation X.Comments (112)Sen.

It\u0027s amateur hour up there.Comments (613)Beth GriffithsBeauty and fashion bloggerThere are many reasons why a person uses a wheelchair, but the biggest thing to remember is this: if you do not know the person then why they use a wheelchair is none of your business.Comments (467)Arianna HuffingtonIn this week\u0027s issue, Jaweed Kaleem looks at the state of American conversation around \"the big questions,\" as students return to college campuses across the country.CommentsAllen FrancesProfessor Emeritus, Duke UniversityThe evidence is compelling that we in the developed countries (especially the US) are overtesting for disease, overdiagnosing it, and overtreating.Comments (21)Adam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; founder of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911The politics of the Affordable Care Act are irrelevant. The issue for me is privacy and data security and whether you\u0027re for Obamacare or against it, there are two ways the program\u0027s rollout could put your personal information at risk.Comments (93)Jonathan WeilerDirector of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel HillAnas\u0027 extraordinary work has me thinking about a debate in America that has acquired new meaning since Glenn Greenwald and others first started reporting in June on the NSA documents leaked by Edward Snowden. Is \"advocacy\" journalism really journalism?Comments (33)Chris NashawatyMovie Critic, Entertainment WeeklyWhen people hear that I review movies for a living, they usually assume that the films I must like are the kinds that win Oscars.CommentsDJ Louie XIVDJI\u0027ve been attending Fashion Week in some form or another since I was about 12, but I\u0027ve always done so as somewhat of an outsider. It started with my mother, then a prominent stylist, who would take me as her plus one to a show whenever possible.CommentsLauren DucaEditorial Fellow, The Huffington PostMeet Jessica \"Biel\" Timberlake.

Live in the moment.Comments (35)Albert BrooksActor, Writer, Filmmaker, Comedian, Author, 2030: The Real Story of What Happens To AmericaMr. Putin, it\u0027s one thing to put down exceptionalism, but before you do that, you at least have to produce one Broadway show, or make one commercial airliner, or invent one type of salad.Comments (1,792)Alison SpiegelBlog Editor, Huffington Post Taste \u0026 TravelIf Portland, the so-called birthplace of the hipster, has become disingenuous, Astoria, Oregon feels just the opposite. It\u0027s not trying to be gritty, rustic and cool -- it just is. A town of restoration and renewal, it\u0027s a beacon of resilience and a great place to visit.Comments (11)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorShouldn\u0027t it make sense that President Obama would enjoy spending more time addressing rising child poverty and restoring taxes on the rich and corporations than ordering self-defeating metastasizing military operations?Comments (71)Kirk DouglasActorThere can never be forgiveness if we do not first admit our mistakes. Racism is a sin for which we have never atoned. It is a grave injustice that must be addressed before we can ever truly move forward as a nation. Apologies are not excuses, but they are a good start on the road to repentance.Comments (310)Barbara ColluraPresident/CEO, RESOLVE: The National Infertility AssociationAisha did not have to share her story.

Nope, second biggest.Comments (16)Janet TavakoliPresident, Tavakoli Structured FinanceThe death of Hugo Chavez may leave Cuba in need of new allies. Perhaps it\u0027s time to negotiate a pact with Cuba: political reforms in Cuba in exchange for trade leniency from the U.S. In the process Cuba might regain her footing, and the U.S. might reap a significant political and economic opportunity.Comments (22)Valerie AlexanderAuthor, \u0027Happiness as a Second Language\u0027That is a human being in that picture.
