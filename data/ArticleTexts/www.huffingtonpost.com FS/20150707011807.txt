{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The No vote to austerity by a margin of 62 to 38 is a stunning vindication of Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras’s tactical gamble and political savvy. But the Greek crisis has demonstrated how deeply divided are the leaders of the E.U. and its most powerful member nations. The one potential bright spot is the partly dissident role of the IMF as abetted by the Obama administration. The best hope is that the IMF -- nominally part of the “troika” of Greece’s creditors but more realistic than the Germans and the European Commission -- will break more openly with the austerity camp. The stakes, however, are larger than Greece, as Europe enters its eighth year of stagnation. Though politicians like Scheuble have been all too ready to jettison Greece to purify fiscally austere Europe, it’s increasingly clear that the E.U. needs to change course -- not just to save Greece but to save itself.After the success of her 2012 best-seller Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can\u0027t Stop Talking, Susan Cain brought together a team to start Quiet Revolution, a company dedicated to \"unlocking the power of introverts for the benefit of us all.\" And now, I\u0027m delighted that HuffPost is joining forces with Quiet Revolution to use all the tools at our disposal to unlock that power and bring these voices and ideas to an even wider audience.Seeing how my new friends have overcome their adversities is such an inspiration. They are so well-adjusted and smart. I\u0027ll be sharing their stories here in the coming weeks and I can\u0027t wait for you to get to know them. They are just like you and me.Public speaker, activist, OlympianDespite coming at the end of the fourth of July weekend when many families are traveling, the overnight TV ratings for the championship match hit 15.2. That\u0027s right, 15.2, making it the highest rated soccer match on U.S. TV of all time (men\u0027s or women\u0027s).Author of \u0027Circus Maximus: The Economic Gamble Behind Hosting the Olympics and World Cup\u0027The Greeks have defied fear. But how will the European governments deal with their own fears? Specifically, how will they react to the possible light-speed contagion of Syriza\u0027s rebelliousness in Spain, Portugal and Italy?Editorial Director, El Huffington PostThe Supreme Court\u0027s recent blessing of Obamacare has precipitated a rush among the nation\u0027s biggest health insurers to consolidate into two or three behemoths. The result will be good for their shareholders and executives, but bad for the rest of us -- who will pay through the nose for the health insurance we need.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027DUBLIN -- The decisive nature of the No vote should persuade European leaders to set aside their hopes of forcing regime change and to focus their minds on the practical implications of a Grexit. They need to acknowledge something that is widely accepted: that Greece cannot pay back all of the money loaned by Europe. Pushing Greece towards a euro exit??is probably the strategy that will ultimately minimize the return of money to the creditors.Professor of Economics, University College DublinI know that right now you are saying, \"But I\u0027m not a racist!\" \"Heritage, not hate!\" But this isn\u0027t your heritage. It\u0027s mine. And it is hate. And it is racism. And every time you put that flag on the back of your car, we all go back in time a little.Clergy, United Church of ChristWhile Americans were celebrating the Fourth of July holiday with fireworks and beach vacations, some prominent Brits were noting a certain irony.Senior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstOur 44th president wanted to be No Drama Obama. But that hasn\u0027t stopped us from turning our experience of him into a story -- a melodrama -- whose future keeps changing its past, whose ending we don\u0027t know and whose reality will continuously be remade until, inevitably, no one who\u0027s around now will be left to find out what happens next.USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorThe outcome of this Greek drama is not up to the Greeks anymore. It now depends on how European leaders will react. Whether they will view the referendum result as an opportunity for a big deal or a chance to rid themselves of the Greek issue, putting all the blame on the Greeks, remains to be seen.Editor-At-Large, HuffPost GreeceAmong the losers -- in addition to the people enrolled in the insurers\u0027 health plans -- will be many of the employees of the acquired companies, and taxpayers in the cities that come out on the short end of the stick when the combined companies decide where the corporate headquarters will be.Author, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgWith the reauthorization of the absurd and dysfunctional NCLB, we have a chance to once again let teachers teach and let students learn. We have a chance to ignite their imaginations, encourage them to reach their full potential, and expand their world view beyond filling in bubble tests with a #2 pencil.President, National Education AssociationDid you ever hear the AAA say that \"cars don\u0027t kill people, people kill people?\" Nobody would ever say something so stupid or dumb. But John Boehner gets away with it every time he and his colleagues cave in to pressure from the NRA and vote to defund CDC research on guns.Mike the Gun GuyAs the world powers negotiate with Iran, they should constantly remind themselves that the Iranian government has not come to the negotiating table to discuss the terms of its surrender. Likewise, Iranian negotiators must realize that Iran\u0027s nuclear program is seen at a threat by major powers.Research Associate at Center for International and Security Studies at the University of Maryland (CISSM)A few years ago I heard His Holiness speak in Los Angeles and I recall him saying to the audience: \"I\u0027m no different than you. The only difference between me and you is that my mind is quieter than yours.\"Actor, writer, and filmmakerSummer is back again and that can only mean one thing -- it\u0027s time to indulge in a whole lot of ice cream.The go-to source for finding the best restaurants and hotelsSo it\u0027s Berlin and Paris. Once again so close and yet so far. Once again European history will move along the red line that unites these two national capitals. There\u0027s nothing to be done for those who, like our Italian Premier, believed as recently as five days ago to have established a special relationship with the Chancellor of Europe.Editor in Chief, The Huffington Post ItalyThe Greek crisis has made it painfully clear that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) needs a change at the top -- and that the U.S. must use its privileged position as the IMF\u0027s biggest contributor to insist on it.Associate Professor of Law, Yale Law SchoolHow many time have you heard the phrase, \"I like Bernie Sanders, but he can\u0027t win,\" uttered by people who identify themselves as progressives? The facts, however, illustrate that \"Bernie Sanders can win\" and nobody in politics foreshadowed the Vermont Senator\u0027s latest surge in both Iowa and New Hampshire.Columnist and author published in The Hill, The Baltimore Sun, The Jerusalem Post, Salon, and other publicationsSometimes, the effects of sexism and implicit gender bias are difficult to show. However, in the case of women\u0027s health care, there\u0027s very little ambiguity. Women should be aware of what these problems look like, so that they can identify doctors who similarly understand them and can fairly diagnose and treat them.Feminist, writer, and satirist (not always in that order)Thou shalt follow these rules.Deputy Managing Editor Of Impact \u0026 Innovation, The Huffington PostThe hierarchical leadership style of the 20th century is fading fast in favor of today\u0027s empowering and collaborative leaders. In today\u0027s organizations people want to make meaningful contributions to the world through their work.Professor of Management Practice, Harvard Business SchoolIf Social Security, the minimum wage, unemployment insurance, and the 40-hour workweek laid the foundation for the middle class in the 20th century, what would be the equivalent for the 21st century? The odd couple of a billionaire entrepreneur and a labor leader have come up with what could be a breakthrough proposal for rebuilding the middle class.Senior Fellow, Roosevelt Institute; author of \u0027Fighting for Our Health\u0027The idea of being attacked by a shark, as unlikely as it is, is scary. But why, if the odds are so low? Because our perception of risk is not just about the numbers. It\u0027s about emotions too. There is no better example of how risk perception is more a matter of emotion than of quantitative reasoning than this classic illustration of how our fears sometimes don\u0027t match the facts.Author, \u0027How Risky Is It, Really?\u0027The American institutional landscape is beginning to resemble the physical landscape a natural disaster. This one is man-made, though.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghIn the absence of a complete and total mending, and a reform of Europe itself, from this moment forward the temptation to follow Athens\u0027 lead will only increase.L\u0027Huffington Post Editorial DirectorIt\u0027s hard to take heed of your husband\u0027s monologue when you are still pissed at him for letting the kids eat chocolate chip cookies for breakfast.Educator,Writer,Wife and MotherCanadians can offer some guidance. After all, 10 years ago this month, we became the fourth nation on Earth to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide. If the U.S. looks to our example, it could learn a lot from Canada\u0027s fight for gay rights.Senior Blogs Editor, Huffington Post CanadaThe attitude that Lyall adopts toward Senator Sanders is, instead, mildly and cheerfully disparaging -- affectionate, but at the proper distance of condescension; ironically agreeable, as you are allowed to be in dealing with a second cousin or an eccentric uncle who is a bit of a blowhard. Hers is not the first such article to appear on Sanders in the Times.Professor of Literature, Yale UniversityCEOs contended their corporations are too poor to pay overtime, but on their next quarterly call with shareholders, they\u0027ll brag about record profits. In 2013, corporate profits were at their highest level in 85 years. That same year, employee compensation was at its lowest level in 65 years.International President, United SteelworkersGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
