{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressAs Congress continues to probe the attacks on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, the conversation seems to be gradually shifting from a hothouse hunt for the scalp of U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice to larger questions about the security breakdown itself. Buzzfeed\u0027s John Stanton sussed out that a shift seemed imminent at the end of last week, and while Sunday\u0027s political talk shows featured Rice\u0027s betes-noires -- Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham -- there was a sense that cooler heads were taking over. Most notably, McCain amigo Sen. Joe Lieberman made it clear to Fox News\u0027 Chris Wallace that he wasn\u0027t all that interested in pursuing the Susan Rice agita much further.Read Post | Comments (2,028)David Mednicoff, 11/19/12Director, Middle Eastern Studies, UMass-AmherstJust because Israelis and Palestinians have different versions of the same history doesn\u0027t mean that we can compare (and then judge, and even dehumanize) them fairly on particular measures where one side doesn\u0027t measure up.Read Post | Comments (71)Dave Bartlett, 11.19.2012Vice President, Smarter Physical Infrastructure, IBMIn the U.S., buildings account for around 40 percent of our energy consumption.

Although we appeared in prime time series a generation apart, our TV characters have a lot in common: high energy, endless chattiness and a certain... combustibility. Most important to both characters, though, is the concept of family.Read Post | Comments (14)Wendell Potter, 11/19/12Center for Public Integrity columnist, author, consultantDisruption.

He is probably the most influential and credible person in official Washington who is not part of the echo chamber on deficit reduction, and a Treasury secretary concerned more about recovery than austerity is just what Obama needs.Read Post | Comments (282)Brian Rooney, 11/19/12Writer and journalistIt\u0027s very serious, but like two high school girls with a romantic interest in the same skinny hipster in the senior class, Israel and Hamas are sending bitchy taunts to each other over Twitter.

Gerard, 11/19/12International President, United SteelworkersRepublicans aren\u0027t talking about extending tax breaks for the 98 percent. Instead, they\u0027re threatening the economic life of the country if they don\u0027t get what they want -- tax breaks for people who don\u0027t need them.Read Post | Comments (656)Dean Baker, 11/19/12Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027The reality is that the large budget deficits of recent years are due to the economic downturn following the collapse of the housing bubble. But pointing out this fact makes one shrill; you have to say that the deficit is a huge problem to be a serious person in Washington.Read Post | CommentsCecile Richards, 11/19/12President of Planned Parenthood Federation of America and Planned Parenthood Action FundThe slow and painful death Ireland\u0027s abortion ban forced Savita to endure brings to mind another tragic story. Earlier this year, doctors in the Dominican Republic refused chemotherapy to a 16-year-old cancer patient because she was pregnant. Think this couldn\u0027t happen in the United States?

Up next is Django Unchained, set for release on Christmas Day. You can spot his movies a mile away, even from one scene, and you can identify traits from film to film, but no one even comes close to capturing the essence of his work.Read Post | CommentsGareth Price, 11/19/12Visiting assistant professor in the linguistics program, Duke UniversityThe curious aspect of U.S. state secession is that the agitation is not to become more Floridian, Tennessean, or Alabamian. Instead, secessionists define their states as more American than America itself.Read Post | Comments (86)Michael Hogan, 11/18/12Executive Arts and Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post Media GroupAre the writers signaling to us that Nicholas Brody\u0027s days are numbered?
