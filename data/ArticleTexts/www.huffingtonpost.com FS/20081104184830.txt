{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOEven if your candidate didn\u0027t win last night, you have reason to celebrate. We all do. Barack Obama\u0027s impressive victory says a lot about America. Because yesterday voters decided that they didn\u0027t want to look back. They wanted to step into the future. And they turned out in unprecedented numbers to make sure that no amount of scrubbed rolls, malfunctioning machines, endless lines, or polling places running out of ballots would block the way. The history of America is studded with great breakthroughs followed by decades of consolidation and occasional regression. Obama\u0027s victory proclaims the end of the dark years of the Bush regression. It\u0027s time for another American breakthrough.Read Post | CommentsBIONora Ephron, 11.05.2008So we held our breath for twenty-two months, twenty-two months of an election that everyone claimed would bore us witless. The exact opposite turned out to be true: it was riveting.Read Post | Comments (100)BIOJohn Cusack, 11.05.2008The world looked to America... we showed our best. The planet sighs in relief and deserves a righteous party. We have beaten back the worst in ourselves; the old and inevitable forces of cynicism and greed.Read Post | CommentsBIOTrey Ellis, 11.05.2008I love history and had often whined that I wasn\u0027t lucky enough to have lived during a more exciting age: I could have been a Tuskegee Airman, Buffalo Soldier, or beatnik. But last night history came to me.Read Post | Comments (51)BIOGary Hart, 11.04.2008The president-elect represents a new, post-Clinton, beyond centrism, post-racial, new politics, internet-driven phenomenon. The nation is fed up with neoconservative imperialists, radical fundamentalists, and failed supply-siders.Read Post | Comments (93)BIOCecile Richards, 11.05.2008It is hard to overstate the landslide victory for women last night. For too long, our health and rights have been used as a political battering ram.Read Post | CommentsBIODavid Rees, 11.05.2008DO NOT OPERATE HEAVY MACHINERY. I realize this may further damage our economy, but I don\u0027t want to be around some forklift operator who suddenly realizes what the heck happened last night.Read Post | CommentsBIORussell Simmons, 11.05.2008The election of Barack Obama, a resounding progressive voice, is a clear reflection of hip-hop politics, and a beautiful testament to the American collective consciousness that is flowering.Read Post | Comments (26)BIONathan Gardels, 11.05.2008Here are some comments I gathered on what Obama\u0027s victory means for America\u0027s image in the world, from thinkers such as Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Tariq Ramadan, and Garry Kasparov.Read Post | CommentsBIOGeorge Stevens, Jr., 11.04.2008I wrote to Barack several days later. Here\u0027s the letter. Looking back, it seems as if today was somehow written in America\u0027s destiny.Read Post | CommentsBIOMarty Kaplan, 11.05.2008What an insult it is to the idea of accountability -- this notion that responsibility for the ugly emotions unleashed by demagoguery this campaign season is wiped away by a concession speech.Read Post | Comments (35)BIOCory Booker, 11.04.2008Barack Obama can be the president that helps America speak to the profound greatness of its rural areas, its suburbs and its mighty cities again.Read Post | CommentsBIOPaul Hogarth, 11.05.2008It pains me to describe it this way, but \"No on 8\" -- like Michael Dukakis -- blew a seventeen-point lead. Our right to marry just got taken away from us, and we\u0027ve got to be smart if we\u0027re going to get it back.Read Post | Comments (32)BIOJamie Lee Curtis, 11.04.2008Thank you Barack Obama. Thank you for four years ago making me say out-loud, \"Why can\u0027t he be our candidate?\" Thank you for blowing away the ether of complacency.Read Post | Comments (133)BIODrew Westen, 11.05.2008The task facing President-elect Obama is to articulate the role of government in the 21st century just as FDR articulated its role in the 20th.Read Post | CommentsBIOHooman Majd, 11.04.2008Tonight, as Americans have decided they would prefer Obama to McCain as their next president there is a sigh of relief, and disbelief, in many quarters in the Middle East, including in Iran.Read Post | Comments (62)BIOKareem Abdul-Jabbar, 11.05.2008Barack Obama\u0027s victory tonight has re-defined for the whole world the meaning of the word \"America.\" The world will forever have a different view of who we are. We now have a new face.Read Post | Comments (26)BIOLee Camp, 11.05.2008Wednesday, Nov. 5: At 8 AM I turn on the news to see if Bristol Palin has announced her \"miscarriage\" yet. (I don\u0027t think she\u0027s really pregnant.)Read Post | CommentsBIOEric Schmeltzer, 11.05.2008Though I don\u0027t know Rahm Emanuel personally, I know those who deal with him. He\u0027s a ball-buster, to put it bluntly and, as Chief of Staff, can keep Democrats thinking long-term.Read Post | Comments (14)Jeff Chang, 11.05.2008Michael Seitzman, 11.05.2008Steven Weber, 11.05.2008Paul Rieckhoff, 11.05.2008Sheryl Crow, 11.04.2008Frank Schaeffer, 11.05.2008Chris Durang, 11.04.2008Amb.
