But just for the hell of it, let\u0027s read the record.Read Post | CommentsBIOJon Robin Baitz, 03.12.2008Underneath the stomach-turning Clintonian strategy for winning the nomination are little passion plays playing out -- about the state of the nation, and the state of its soul-sick psyche.Read Post | Comments (16)BIOBill Maher, 03.12.2008I\u0027m going to throw the remote through the TV if one more news twink says something on the order of \"When we come back, we\u0027ll look into what drives a successful man like Eliot Spitzer to risk it all...\" Oh yes, let\u0027s convene a panel of experts for that.Read Post | Comments (509)BIOAlec Baldwin, 03.12.2008People ramble on about what it means. Another sex scandal. Acre upon acre of bullshit about legalizing prostitution and the male animal\u0027s burden of a higher sex drive. What garbage.Read Post | Comments (47)BIOJohn Sweeney, 03.12.2008When the AFL-CIO started doing research to uncover McCain\u0027s record on working family issues, it uncovered layer after layer of hostile, Bush-esque actions and positions wrapped in his camouflage as a straight-talking maverick.Read Post | CommentsBIOJohn Zogby, 03.12.2008The irony of an attorney general acting as a criminal can\u0027t be avoided, especially acting like the very kind of criminal that Spitzer himself would have nailed to the wall.Read Post | CommentsBIOSusan Kaiser Greenland, 03.12.2008If the Clinton campaign isn\u0027t careful, it will set the women\u0027s movement back a generation or so. As women, it is not in our best interests to be viewed as victims.Read Post | Comments (223)BIOJames Moore, 03.11.2008If there is anyone qualified to make comparisons between Karl Rove and Hillary Clinton, it\u0027s me. Like democracy\u0027s Darth Vader, she relies on surrogates to go out and fire the gun.Read Post | Comments (609)BIONora Ephron, 03.11.2008Eliot Spitzer, who a year ago had a shot at national office, is today a laughingstock because of his reckless involvement in... what? Let\u0027s just say this right out: in nothing.Read Post | Comments (489)BIOEric Deggans, 03.12.2008This is the way Dems will snatch defeat from the jaws of victory in this election: allowing dunderheads like Ferraro to drive wedges between a coalition poised to unseat the Republicans in November.Read Post | Comments (29)Ari Emanuel, 03.11.2008Whether you\u0027re what\u0027s-his-name in that airport toilet, or that guy with the interns, or Client #9 at The Mayflower, the right thing for you to do is to get the hell out of public life.Read Post | Comments (125)BIORJ Eskow, 03.12.2008Comments like Ms. Ferraro\u0027s play into the fears and resentments of some lower-income white voters -- the same voters who just so happen to be Sen. Clinton\u0027s strongest voting bloc.Read Post | Comments (399)BIOJohn K. Wilson, 03.12.2008Approximately 25% of Clinton\u0027s voters in Mississippi were Republicans voting for a candidate they hate in order to try to undermine Barack Obama.Read Post | Comments (48)Amanda Michel, 03.11.2008Greg Mitchell, 03.12.2008Jennifer Lehr, 03.11.2008Amb.
