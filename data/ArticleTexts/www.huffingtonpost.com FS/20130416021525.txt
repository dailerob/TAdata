{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Howard FinemanEditorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupScreams are sweet music to terrorists, the soundtrack they need to hear as they dramatize their grievances by murdering innocents. They are the enemies of freedom, because their only true aim is to shackle society in the chains of fear. But Monday was Patriots\u0027 Day in Massachusetts, a celebration of freedom in honor of the first shots fired in a war fought in the name of liberty -- and a day on which Bostonians usually celebrate in a touching act of community, a marathon in which strangers cheer on strangers. Today, rescuers ran toward the wounded on Boylston Street in acts of true heroism -- running toward the sound of the screams. In the end, the terrorists will fail because Bostonians did not turn from their fellow men -- they turned toward them. And that is the real music of mankind.Comments (24)Patton OswaltComedian and writer who lives and drinks in Los AngelesThe vast majority stands against that darkness and, like white blood cells attacking a virus, they dilute and weaken and eventually wash away the evildoers and, more importantly, the damage they wreak.Comments (23)Kenny YumManaging Editor, The Huffington Post Canada/AOL CanadaWhen I heard about bombs and Boston, it was a shock to the system. I know more than several runners down there and I\u0027ve literally been in their shoes, struggling down that final straightaway. The finish of the Boston Marathon is the happiest place for a runner, where dreams are fulfilled.CommentsRev. Emily C. HeathClergy, United Church of ChristNo matter what we learn about the who or the why of what happened today, I choose to believe that in the end \"perfect love casts out fear.\" In our hearts. In our minds. And on that one city block in the heart of Boston.CommentsMichael LevinNYT Bestselling Author, EntrepreneurI was at mile 17 of the Boston Marathon when a runner looked up from her cellphone and said, in disbelief, a bomb went off at the finish line.CommentsSahar AzizAssociate Professor of Law, Texas Wesleyan University School of LawWe have yet to know who was behind this despicable act of terror. But whomever it was, we must stand by our core values as we seek justice for the victims of this horrendous attack. For any attack against America is an attack against all Americans, regardless of their faith or ethnicity.CommentsChristina HuffingtonI was having trouble breathing. \"Am I going to be okay?\" I asked the nurse who was monitoring my heart rate. \"I don\u0027t know,\" she said. \"If you are, I hope you stop destroying your life.\" It was not the first time substance abuse had landed me in the emergency room. But, though I didn\u0027t know it then, it would be my last.Comments (255)Rob LeeAppalachian State University Undergraduate StudentThe Psalmist doesn\u0027t offer explanations to the tragedies in our world, but the writer offers the presence of a living and loving God.Comments (12)Jeffrey SachsDirector, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \u0027The Price of Civilization\u0027If we act calmly and sensibly, we can easily defuse the current crisis. North Korea is looking for respect, not war. It\u0027s time to talk, to lower the heat, and to avoid a confrontation or the imposition of impossible or humiliating demands.Comments (209)Keith OlbermannWriter, Baseball NerdThe kid looking at the camera, the kid Jackie Robinson seems to be looking at? Meet Eddie Dweck.Comments (100)Michael HoganExecutive Arts and Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post Media Group\"Game of Thrones\" is above all a show about underdogs: the giant female knight; the ridiculed and underestimated dwarf; the princess sold to a savage tribe; the bastard son of a warrior decapitated and denounced as a traitor; his overweight buddy; etc., etc.Comments (342)John DearChristian peace activist, author of \u0027Lazarus, Come Forth!\u0027 and \u0027A Persistent Peace.\u0027 www.johndear.orgThe grave injustice of Guanatanamo must end immediately. President Obama and the U.S. government need to address the issues of the hunger strikers now before one prisoner dies.Comments (20)Leo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersDemocrats must exorcise the evil specter of Margaret Thatcher and promote a budget that respects Americans\u0027 time-honored commitment to each other and to community.Comments (89)Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Fiscal conservatives around Obama have sold the president on the idea that nipping and tucking Social Security and Medicare is an easy way to get a lot of money, and doing it by the backdoor will entail a lower political cost to him.Comments (538)Monica BielankoBlogger, The Girl WhoI find myself really sinking into motherhood in a way I\u0027ve never experienced before. Up until recently, I engaged myself in battles I should\u0027ve known I couldn\u0027t win.Comments (41)Maureen RyanTV critic, The Huffington PostI\u0027d like to petition the authorities to have every episode punctuated by Trudy reading Pete the riot act, or at the very least, having someone punch Pete in the face.Comments (178)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027We\u0027re now witnessing what happens when all of the economic gains go to the top, and the rest of the population doesn\u0027t have enough purchasing power to keep the economy going.Comments (190)Mark SawyerProfessor at UCLAWhere does all the \"Cuba is racist\" talk come from? Why do we have white commentators accusing Jay Z and Beyonce of betraying their blackness on television?Comments (67)Jonathan WeilerDirector of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel HillI have heard Obama defenders say for years that he\u0027s a really smart guy, so they trust him to do what\u0027s right -- that he\u0027s playing 12-dimensional chess and as the meme has it -- \"he\u0027s got this.\" But can\u0027t one be a generally smart guy and still ultimately think some really dumb things?Comments (47)Steven StraussAdjunct Lecturer in Public Policy, Harvard Kennedy SchoolBitcoin seeks to be an electronic cash (currency) system that doesn\u0027t rely on trust. Paradoxically, Bitcoin requires a trust-based ecosystem.Comments (107)Lincoln MitchellHarriman Institute, Columbia UniversityA debate about background checks is something of a lose-lose proposition for advocates of gun regulation. If that proposal fails, it will be extremely difficult to pass any laws regulating gun ownership, but if it passes it will not be a big victory.Comments (20)John PavleyCTO @ The Huffington Post, BloggerI want the critical messages to get through without having to set-up exceptions and hide all my toys. If the house is on fire or North Korea does something naughty, I want to know about it.Comments (11)Abraham H. FoxmanNational Director, Anti-Defamation LeagueAs Israel celebrates its 65th birthday, we should pause to marvel at the many successes of the Jewish state. Democracies around the world, including the U.S., have taken centuries to achieve the type of political, social and economic advances that define Israel\u0027s existence today.Comments (12)Christy Turlington BurnsFounder, Every Mother Counts, Director/Producer, NO WOMAN, NO CRY, global maternal health advocate, mom, modelThe impact one cell phone can make on the life of a woman in labor anywhere in the world when she doesn\u0027t have the time or means to get to healthcare is remarkable.CommentsTom EngelhardtEditor, TomDispatch.comHad you been able to time-travel back to the Cold War era to inform Americans that, in the future, our major enemies would be in Afghanistan, Yemen, Somalia, Mali, Libya, and so on, they would surely have thought you mad (or lucky indeed).Comments (43)Amitai EtzioniProfessor of international relations, George Washington UniversitySixty-five years ago it was far from obvious that Israel would survive; it was even far from obvious that a Jewish state would be created in the first place. In 1947, I attended a most remarkable meeting.CommentsDan Glickman and Ann M. VenemanWhen families go to restaurants, movie theaters, sports arenas and supermarkets, they should have the option to eat healthier food and the calorie information they need to make informed choices between various food options.CommentsLester \u0026 CharliePolitical satiristsGod bless Ron Paul. Really. He\u0027s terribly worried about your kids. Worried that they\u0027ll complete their education and still not understand the biblical principle of self-government. Or know how to defend the free market. Start a home business. Operate their YouTube channel.Comments (70)Richard CurtisScreenwriter, DirectorA preventable, curable disease, was killing close to a million children a year. Can you know these facts, and not do anything about them? Was I going to be a writer who knew about this -- and yet continue to write fictional films usually featuring weddings?CommentsBenjamin Todd JealousPresident and CEO, NAACPNo person can maximize the American Dream on the minimum wage. The NYC fast-food workers\u0027 newfound willingness to organize a union and strike -- at tremendous personal and economic risk -- shows just how bad the economy has become for low-wage workers.Comments (101)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; host, \u0027The Breakdown\u0027; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureThe real problem isn\u0027t taxation. Our real problem is the new \"bipartisan\" drive toward austerity, a mad obsession which runs against the 75-year political consensus of both political parties. Once our leaders understood government\u0027s vital role in a healthy economy.Comments (119)Rek LeCounte, 2013.15.04William Laney, 2013.15.04Peter D.
