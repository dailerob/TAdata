{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Why the German embrace of austerity (for everyone else)? Because it serves Germany just fine. The French situation, with rising unemployment, rising deficits and falling exports, could not be more different.

As Angela Merkel speaks grandly of a closer European Union and a common (very austere) European fiscal policy, her flawed vision and blunt use of German economic power are destroying the European project.

Daughters, Fathers, and the Changing American Family\u0027As Americans rinse off the stench of the long sad Edwards affair, we find ourselves wondering yet again: how did this happen?Read Post | Comments (56)Marty Kaplan, 06/04/12Director, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolDavid Brooks writes that, \"Many people today have not been given vocabularies to talk about what virtue is...\" The trouble isn\u0027t that we lack a moral vocabulary; it\u0027s that that language has long been a mask for wielding power.Read Post | Comments (35)Leo W. Gerard, 06/04/12International President, United SteelworkersRomney is loving high unemployment. Just like the Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives that has repeatedly blocked President Obama\u0027s proposals to increase hiring, Romney believes high joblessness is good for the GOP.Read Post | Comments (827)Alanis Morissette, 06/04/12Grammy-winning musician and actressIt seems as though a healthy moderate version of parenting -- where our shame about our bodies and our sexuality, our traumas and our resistances to connection are addressed -- is where most of us, ultimately, really want to fall.Read Post | Comments (71)James Franco, 06/04/12Actor and authorI am not a sports fan, but that didn\u0027t keep me from loving If I Don\u0027t Six by Elwood Reid. There is something more to this book that takes it out of the sports fiction genre and brings it into the realm of literary fiction.Read Post | CommentsDean Baker, 06/04/12Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Alan Simpson, the foul-mouthed former senator, is back in the news. He once again launched an obscenity-laden diatribe against those who oppose his plans to cut Social Security and Medicare. Unfortunately, the focus of the media attention has been on the senator\u0027s use of obscenities.Read Post | CommentsRev. Al Sharpton, 06/04/12President, National Action NetworkToday, in the city of NY, we are facing another troubling form of biased profiling and searches known as \u0027Stop-and-Frisk.\u0027 Only difference is, this time, you can be targeted for simply walking down the street.Read Post | CommentsSenator Barbara A. Mikulski, 06/04/12U.S. Senator from MarylandAmerican women are mad as hell, and we\u0027re not going to take it anymore. It\u0027s time to close the loopholes, level the playing field and end the outrageous cost of being a woman. It\u0027s time to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and once and for all have equal pay for equal work.Read Post | Comments (14)Mark Hyman, MD, 06/03/12Practicing physicianEach of us has the capacity to make the small changes in our lives that will create big changes in our food landscape, our agriculture and even our government policies.Read Post | Comments (336)Maureen Ryan, 06/04/12TV critic, The Huffington PostThe finale may have been a bit overstuffed, but Season 2 as a whole has been tremendously satisfying, given how well it has distilled George R.R. Martin\u0027s themes with coherence, compassion and spectacular visuals.Read Post | Comments (305)Cara Santa Maria, 06/01/12Science correspondent, Huffington Post; editor, Talk Nerdy to MeTomorrow is the big day.

If libertarians want the fusionist alliance to keep going and the political right to remain in power, they\u0027re going to have to stop being nuts.Read Post | Comments (547)Soraya Chemaly, 06/04/12Feminist, Satirist and Media CriticI knew men invented fire and water and are probably responsible for figuring out how to make a thumb opposable. But the INTERNET? I had NO IDEA.Read Post | Comments (21)Rep. Luis Gutierrez, 06/04/12Congressman Representing Illinois\u0027 4th District in ChicagoAs Chief Executive, President Obama has extraordinary leeway under our current immigration laws to prevent the deportation of certain immigrants if it is not in our national interest to deport them.Read Post | Comments (24)Juliette Fretté, 06/03/12Writer and Modern FeministAh, how nice it is to have a product exploring women\u0027s pleasure, one that doesn\u0027t undermine our confidence or power in the way that many beauty products and home cleaning supplies do.Read Post | Comments (127)Nancy Keenan, 06/04/12President, NARALIn the first five months of 2012, the anti-choice House leadership has lined up no fewer than five separate bills with anti-choice provisions for floor action. It\u0027s amazing they can keep a straight face when they say there\u0027s no War on Women.Read Post | Comments (114)Tamika D. Mallory and Marvin Bing, 06/04/12\u0027Stop and frisk\u0027 criminalizes our youth, creates further distrust between the community and police, and doesn\u0027t do a thing to keep us safer. It used to be that we feared driving while Black; in New York and around the nation, we now fear simply walking down the street while Black or Latino.Read Post | Comments (30)Gary Hart, 06/02/12President, Hart International, Ltd.For those who believe in a society, that to some degree we are all in this together, there are three choices: resist change, stagnate or progress. So far, no one has discovered how to progress without the institutions of government.Read Post | Comments (446)Mike Lux, 06/04/12Partner, Democracy PartnersPresident Clinton, I hope you will see the error of your ways on this fundamental issue. Those middle-class people who work hard and play by the rules want you back on their side where you once were, not the side of the big banks.Read Post | Comments (77)Erika Lust, 06/04/12Writer, Erotic Film DirectorWhen people around me learn of my profession in pornography, they immediately start asking morbid questions. I\u0027m used to this: Society has always tried to control our sexuality. But I\u0027m not so much concerned with society. I\u0027m more concerned with what I\u0027ll say when my daughters ask: \"Mommy, what is your job?\"Read Post | Comments (59)Robert Gallucci, 06/04/12President, John D. and Catherine T.
