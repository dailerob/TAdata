Under a proposal by the Obama administration, oil and gas activity could begin in those waters as early as 2017. That would take us in exactly the wrong direction, exposing these waters to the risk of a catastrophic spill, expanding an inherently hazardous industrial operation at sea and locking the next generation into mountains more of the dangerous carbon pollution that\u0027s driving climate change.

This is a question that has vexed philosophers for millennia. It\u0027s a debate being taken up not just by philosophers and psychologists, but also AI researchers.

And, if so, can a robot have one?CEO, Family Online Safety InstituteTwo court cases next week will decide the future of Wisconsin campaign finance law, the independence of the Wisconsin judiciary, and will impact the future of presidential candidate Scott Walker. The stakes could not be higher, but the converging cases have garnered little national attention.The Center for Media and Democracy/ALEC Exposed\"I think that everyone just desires to be and to feel loved.

The issue is their die-hard, take no prisoners, assault on Obama.Author and political analystAlmost every time I go out in the gayborhood, I experience some form of ageism.
