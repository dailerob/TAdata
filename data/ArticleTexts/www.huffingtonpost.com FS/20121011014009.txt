{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editorial Director, Huffington Post Media GroupBefore last Wednesday\u0027s debate, one of the grand viziers of number-crunching said that no one who was in Romney\u0027s trailing position at that point had ever come back to win the White House. That looks like a laughable statement now. My own view was that it was way too early to count Romney out. I wrote and said that a guy who had made that many mistakes -- who had had so much dumped on his head, and who still remained within hailing distance of the president -- still had a chance. Less than a week later, things seemed to have turned utterly upside-down. The Denver debate has sent Romney rocketing into a lead, and tightened races in key swing states to the point that a Romney Electoral College victory now seems eminently possible -- rather than the ridiculous GOP wishful thinking it looked like only days ago.Read Post | Comments (1,434)Bob Cesca, 10/10/12Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez Show, Media ProducerIllustrative of his contempt for the truth, Mitt Romney\u0027s campaign website hosts the following statement: \"Since President Obama assumed office three years ago, federal spending has accelerated at a pace without precedent in recent history.\" On Friday, we discovered yet another reason why this is a super-colossal lie.Read Post | Comments (586)Robert Reich, 10/10/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Beware Joe Biden: Paul Ryan will appear affable. He\u0027s less polished and aggressive than Romney, even soft-spoken. And he acts as if he\u0027s saying reasonable things. But under the surface he\u0027s a right-wing zealot.Read Post | Comments (62)Hanna Flint, 10/10/12Showbiz Journalist and Radio ProducerIt\u0027s not too much of a stretch to consider the Kardashian clan as the modern day Bennet family, but for the sake of the youngest members let\u0027s hope it\u0027s not too late to rewrite their story.Read Post | Comments (48)Richard Trumka and Ai-jen Poo, 10/10/12It is clear now more than ever that the labor movement and the domestic workers\u0027 movement need to continue to work together to protect the rights of all workers.Read Post | CommentsCristina Page, 10/10/12Author, \u0027How the Pro-Choice Movement Saved America\u0027This election year is the first in which American\u0027s access to contraception will be dramatically increased or dramatically scaled back depending on who wins the Oval Office.Read Post | Comments (874)Marcia Cross, 10/10/12Award-winning actressA life without education leaves girls vulnerable and with no real choices.

It was all there in black and white.Read Post | Comments (64)Douglas Anthony Cooper, 10/10/12Novelist, Amnesia (See: Blogger Mortis)I admire Wikipedia -- always have -- but how do the official gardeners at Wikipedia respond when they have a snake in their grass?
