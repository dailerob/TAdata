{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Republican presidential hopeful Scott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin, thinks he\u0027s hit political pay dirt with his proposal to gut faculty tenure protections at his state\u0027s public universities, notably the flagship University of Wisconsin. His idea is to remove tenure protection from state law, and leave the actual policy to the Board of Regents, his political appointees. All this plays well with the Tea Party base. Walker needs to differentiate himself from the other presumed top-tier GOP contenders. Unlike Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, often mentioned with Walker and Jeb Bush as the leading candidates, Walker as a governor can point to his state as a laboratory of conservatism. But are elite college professors really overpaid? We\u0027ve reached a point in this country where astronomical paydays are deemed acceptable as long as they occur in the private sector -- and merely decent earnings in the public sector are suspect.Some in Europe, especially in Germany, seem nonchalant about a Greek exit from the eurozone. The market has, they claim, already \"priced in\" such a rupture. I believe that such views significantly underestimate both the current and future risks involved.Professor at Columbia University and a Nobel Laureate in EconomicsIn every election cycle since 2008, more money has gone into lobbying at the federal level than into political campaigns. And an increasing portion of that lobbying money has gone into the pockets of former members of Congress.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The President is asking for \"fast track\" authority to let the White House be the sole negotiator on the Trans Pacific Partnership. The so-called partnership is an insult to all U.S. workers, with many provisions that will hurt women the most.Money Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsForeign vessels have been plundering the waters of West Africa for decades to stock the fish markets of Europe and Asia. Industrial fishing is depriving West African people of a vital source of protein and pushing thousands of locals into poverty and despair.Executive Director, Greenpeace InternationalMy truth is not yours, nor my female identity yours, either. But I have my truth and my female identity, and all I ask is that you respect mine as I respect yours. I have travelled through the world as a woman and been shaped by it, just not for as long as you.Executive Director, Gender Rights MarylandHistory shows the very opposite of progress when it comes to these democratic sovereignty-shredding and job-exporting corporate-driven trade treaties -- unless progress is referring to fulfilling the deepest wishes of runaway global corporations.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorAttorney General Loretta Lynch and her FBI colleagues have done their job. They have painstakingly followed the roadmap from the bottom of a corrupt global conspiracy to the top. That is a good thing. It is only their choice of which corrupt global conspiracy to tackle that seems curious.President, Fiscal Strategies GroupThe American Civil Rights Movement unfolded over many decades and upon multiple planes. Most commonly, however, the planes of struggle considered are public schools, lunch counters, and buses. Yet, one of the most significant planes upon which this critical history unfolded were places of recreation: beaches and swimming pools.Award-Winning Author of Freestyle: Reflections on Faith, Family, Justice, and Pop Culture; Founding Pastor of Joy Tabernacle A.M.E. Church in Dallas, TexasWe all come from different backgrounds, and each of our children is unique. I have learned I am in no position to judge the decisions other parents makes for themselves and their children.SF-Based MomThe United States Freedom Act does not trouble Intelligence agency leaders. They have widely assumed, as admitted in private statements, that the compromise provisions merely create a few procedural inconveniences that could be circumvented or neutralized by exploiting loopholes - no more than speed bumps.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghThe Dominican Republic has actually tortured its own constitution, and a host of human rights laws to persecute the poorest of its citizens. You see, in the Dominican case, the country has used anti-immigrant rhetoric against its own racial minority citizens. But they are not immigrants!Professor of Law, Florida International UniversityOur tendency to procrastinate may be largely due to the fact that we put things off until \"someday.\" Since \"someday\" never appears on the calendar, our good intentions don\u0027t turn into action until we create deadlines.Psychotherapist and author of \u002713 Things Mentally Strong People Don\u0027t Do\u0027Americans know the ugly truth about money in politics. Though the wealthy conceal payoffs through dark money deposits into political pockets, it\u0027s no secret to the American public that the rich are buying the government.International President, United SteelworkersWe assume a lot about people, and especially about their bodies. Maybe it somehow seems more reasonable to make assumptions about the things we can see. These women are my friends, my village, and they are willing to share their stories with you so that you may honor them.Feminist, body positive, wife, mom of five, Editor In Chief at ravishly.com, (sometimes) RN.I notice this is a surprisingly short account of the year\u0027s Tony Awards as scoped from the press room. I can only suggest it\u0027s an indication of the excitement the event didn\u0027t create from start to finish.Writer, Drama CriticAmerica\u0027s current leadership has failed to grasp the significance of a radical global change underway inside the Eurasian land mass.Professor of History at the University of Wisconsin-MadisonMaking an effort to decrease the amount of food you waste has several benefits, from money savings to environmental support and even philanthropy. Curious where to start? A little planning and self-awareness goes a long way.Dietitian, Chef, Real Food Advocate, MomWhat started in 2009 as a group of twenty-five has expanded to over 6,000 Muslim clergy who are now training one another to preach and teach about the importance of the dignity and empowerment of women and girls within Islam.Executive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostIt\u0027s hard to dispute that they taste damn good with these 26 delicious recipes jam packed with them.The women\u0027s lifestyle destinationResearchers who focus on policy issues traditionally look for majority opinion as a guide to what may or may not be possibly changed in the public domain. But the fact that slightly less than half of all gun owners support the ban on assault rifles is a finding which needs to be considered on its own terms.Mike the Gun GuyCaitlyn\u0027s mother, Esther Jenner, has called her daughter \"beautiful,\" said she has \"nothing but admiration for my child\" and that she wants to learn more about gender dysphoria. In many ways, Esther\u0027s attitude is as valuable as the spotlight Caitlyn Jenner is shining on the trans community. Too often, mothers and fathers tell transgender children not to be themselves.Blogs Editor, Huffington Post CanadaHastert shocking... but Alter recalls how he sleazily pocketed millions when legislation enhanced his private property. Alter-Matalin debate how Pope wants to phase out fossil fuels while many Catholic Republicans are in big oil\u0027s pockets. Then: Is O\u0027Malley Hart and Hillary Mondale? Is Obama Jew-ish?Host, \u0027Both Sides Now\u0027Ronnie Gilbert, an original member of the legendary folk group, the Weavers, died today (June 7) at the age of 88. While the prodigiously talented Pete Seeger was clearly the most noted member of the group, it was Ronnie Gilbert who gave the Weavers their lyrical elegance.David Macaray is a playwright and author (\"Night Shift: 270 Factory Stories\").Should Americans join the military if the next commander-in-chief of the armed services is an arrogant, ignorant, irresponsible, war-happy hawk? Many of America\u0027s best and brightest join the armed services. But with the U.S. constantly at war, joining is a life or death decision, dependent on the judgment of whoever sits in the Oval Office.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteSome of you may have already heard about Creflo Dollar, the pastor of Atlanta\u0027s giant World Changers Church International, asking for financial help to \"achieve our goal to purchase the Gulfstream G650 airplane.\"Blogs at theboeskool.com about Jesus, politics, and bathroom humorI am a medical student, yes. I am also a survivor of sexual violence. The recent surge of articles surrounding Emma Sulkowickz prompted me to reflect on this latter identity. I know I will always carry the mark of my trauma with me -- and I am learning how I will better empathize with patients because of it.Critical observer, social justice advocate, anthropologist \u0026 physician-in-training @ Yale.The deal -- If the State granted higher profits (read rate increases on phone customers) and gave tax breaks, this extra money would be used to pay for constructing these new networks over the next 20 years.Executive Director, New Networks InstituteEven if Caitlyn is setting an impossible standard for acceptance, she is only one early step toward acceptance for people of all gender expressions. We\u0027ve come a long way over the last 10 and even five years. In your lifetime we will come even farther. You\u0027re an important part of that work.Psychology and self-help publisherIf you\u0027re tired of defending Christianity every time another self-professed Christian makes the news for doing something evil, and yet you also find yourself denouncing Islam as an inherently evil religion based on what you see on TV and what little you\u0027ve read of the Quran, I urge you to stop.Writer, Blogger, \u0026 SpeakerIronically, Sister Pat taught me to have faith. Not in God, but in people. Because there are people out there who are just amazing through and through. Who do good everyday for all the right reasons.
