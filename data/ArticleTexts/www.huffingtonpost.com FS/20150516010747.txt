It is the most serious action that government can take. It should be a last resort, reserved for the most important interests and most moral causes. None of these is at stake in the case of Iran. Americans demanding that Washington attack Iran demonstrate that Lord Acton\u0027s axiom, \"Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely,\" applies even to the United States.

Washington should officially take the military option off of the table when dealing with Iran.By changing the way we do business, by looking beyond our own impacts to systemic areas where we can make a transformational difference, and by working with others to achieve shared goals, business can play a bigger role in creating a better future.CEO, UnileverI\u0027ve seen you cringe just a little when someone says your child is lucky to have you.
