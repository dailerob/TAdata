{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week was consumed with the drama in Crimea, where 30,000 Russian troops provoked a tense standoff. Right on cue, the usual Beltway suspects whose foreign policy acumen gave us that glorious and tidy success, the Iraq war, sprang into action. \"It started with Benghazi\" (Lindsey Graham). Obama is \"weak and indecisive\" and \"invites aggression\" (John McCain). The situation raises many questions, including: why are those who\u0027ve been so wrong on foreign policy still taken seriously? What Obama should do, beyond sanctions that were in place by Thursday, was unclear. Troops? Bombs? Nuclear war? Maybe we could send Mitch McConnell, who showed up at the CPAC panderfest brandishing a musket rifle. Then Ted Cruz fired up the crowd with that moldy oldie, \u0027repeal Obamacare.\u0027 Meanwhile, Darrell Issa shut down Elijah Cummings\u0027 microphone during Issa\u0027s fishless I.R.S. fishing expedition: a perfect metaphor for our current political debate.Comments (32)Saadia ZahidiSenior Director and Head of Gender Parity and Human Capital at the World Economic ForumWith Cold War-style politics gripping Eastern Europe this week, it seems fitting that one of the most iconic Soviet holidays is upon us: International Women\u0027s Day, which began as a socialist celebration of women\u0027s economic, political and social achievements.Comments (16)Richard BransonFounder, Virgin GroupMore businesses should be following Apple\u0027s stance in encouraging more investment in sustainability. While Tim Cook told sustainability skeptics to \"get out of our stock,\" I would urge climate change deniers to get out of our way.Comments (251)Lori LeibovichExecutive Lifestyle Editor, The Huffington PostIt hurts to do my job, lift my daughter, carry grocery bags, or make it through the day without popping Advils. The message my body is sending is clear: Stop typing, tapping and scrolling, now.Comments (11)Nadia Tolokonnikova and Masha AlyokhinaWhen we arrived to visit a women\u0027s prison with our prison-reform organization, unknown men attacked us with blinding liquid. We believe the attack was sanctioned by the Russian Federal Security Service.Comments (94)Harry BelafonteEntertainer \u0026 ActivistThere is a crisis that demands our urgent attention. For the last four decades, this country has been obsessed with expanding the number of people we throw behind bars and the length of time we hold them there.Comments (94)Malala Yousafzai and Shiza ShahidThe question remains, how do we encourage more men to be advocates for the women in their lives?CommentsMichael VlahosWriter and National Security expertWhat we are watching unfold before us is surely the hoped-for beginning of yet another Russian Renovatio -- and not just a dictator fantasy, but rather a collective desire -- \"The Body\" is being restored.Comments (101)Laura Carmichael and Clotilde Josaime St. JeanMore than a century has passed since the first International Women\u0027s Day, and as we look back to past accomplishments and forward to future goals, we urge readers to take action in one of the most pressing challenges facing women internationally: the present state of maternal and newborn health in developing nations.CommentsDonna SpragueMother, wife of military veteran, unemployed nurseWe are at a loss as to what we will do now that the unemployment has just run out. We live month to month. We really do not want to become homeless, but if something doesn\u0027t give, that is where we will end up, without even a vehicle to sleep in. In Ohio, in winter.Comments (299)John C. McGinleyActor; Ambassador, Special Olympics Spread the Word to End the WordWhen employing this specific language, the objective is to separate and distinguish the \"user\" from those being \"used.\"Comments (81)Mattea KramerResearch director, National Priorities ProjectDespite cries of doom since the across-the-board cuts known as sequestration surfaced in Washington in 2011, the Pentagon has seen few actual reductions, and there is no indication that will change any time soon.Comments (11)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarThere is an argument that the Internet makes us smarter, makes us faster, makes us more connected; it also appears to be making us meaner; especially in the warren of social media.Comments (27)Sen. Bernie SandersIndependent U.S. Senator from VermontThe Postal Service is under constant and vicious attack. Why? The answer is simple. There are very powerful and wealthy special interests who want to privatize or dismember virtually every function that government now performs, whether it is Social Security, Medicare, public education or the Postal Service.Comments (194)Dae-Whan ChangChairman, Maekyung Media GroupAsia has been rapidly creating and accumulating wealth and knowledge. In spite of these spectacular achievements and success, Asia is now faced with a renewed urgency to find an efficient solution for securing sustainable future growth.CommentsTrudie StylerActress, director, producer, and humanitarianIt is not my place, nor my expertise, to opine on the legal matters involved. I am nonetheless compelled, principally because of the suffering of humble, dignified people I have witnessed in Ecuador at the hands of an American company, to say that Chevron\u0027s legal and public relations tactics in this case constitute a grave injustice.CommentsOla OjewumiFounder, Sacred Hearts Children’s Transplant Foundation and Project ASCENDThere are hundreds of little Lupitas across the globe that now believe they can achieve their dreams because of your presence as an astounding role model. This Oscar win is more than just another accolade; it symbolizes a change that women of color have been waiting for.Comments (41)Larry CrandellVolunteer \u0026 RaconteurI\u0027m older than Scotch tape. And it was invented in 1930. I\u0027ve lived through the Great Depression and served in the Army Air Corps in World War II. At 90 and ¾, I only date women who like antiques.Comments (28)Shireen AhmedWriter and advocate focusing on Muslim women in sportsHow can I laud FIFA for striking down a law that should have never been implemented in the first place? Being ripped from the game because a lot of white, privileged men decided it was dangerous for me and the sport was torturous. Football is for all of us. It should always have been.Comments (74)John Kerry, Eric H. Holder, Jr. and Sally JewellYou can do your part too. Do not buy suspicious goods. Do not buy ivory -- even small trinkets or jewelry. Turn down the offer to buy that tiger skin rug. Reject the shark fin soup. We can make a difference for ourselves, and for generations to come.Comments (14)Sandra Bond Chapman, Ph.D.Cognitive neuroscientist; Founder and Chief Director, Center for BrainHealth, University of Texas at DallasWith all the buzz about brain games -- such as crossword puzzles, Sudoku, and even brain training websites -- it begs the question: Can brain games be beneficial to brain health? As a cognitive neuroscientist, this is a question I get asked a lot. And the answer is yes and no.Comments (20)TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"What if deception is in the eye of the beholder? And what if lies can help us tell the truth? Enter into the multimedia world of magician Marco Tempest and decide for yourself.Comments (20)January Jones and Andrew SharplessThough shark finning is no longer allowed in U.S. waters, the trade in shark fins is still legal. To remedy this problem, eight U.S. states and three U.S. territories passed bans outlawing the possession, sale, trade and consumption of shark fins, eliminating a large percentage of the U.S. market.CommentsMarian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundSeventeen-year-old Theresa Tran is one of this year\u0027s winners of the Children\u0027s Defense Fund-Ohio\u0027s Beat the Odds® scholarships after overcoming tough odds including physical disability, the death of a beloved sibling, and a father who suddenly abandoned the family.CommentsGov. Deval PatrickGovernor, MassachusettsAs a black man, my heart aches over the disproportionate numbers of men and boys of color left back by schools, left out of jobs and caught up in crime. As a black public official, I am struck by how little appetite there seems to be among law makers to deal with the root causes of this.Comments (24)Mary RobinsonPresident, Mary Robinson Foundation - Climate Justice; Fmr. President of IrelandFor the women who are in leading roles in business, I have a proposition to make.

But better to get nothing passed right now and continue to embarrass the GOP and watch it implode than to compromise our rights and pander to those extremists.Comments (78)Princess Haya Al HusseinUN Messenger of PeaceSimply put, life as a \"couch potato\" puts you at risk. In the long term, you\u0027re safer parachuting, rock climbing, or arguing with a heavyweight boxer than lying around at home. Sooner or later you will pay for the lack of exercise, and that can be painful.CommentsMichael KeeganPresident, People For the American WayIt feels like at least every week, we\u0027re expected to believe that Republicans have learned their lesson about the dangers of embracing extremism. But is the lesson ever actually learned?CommentsKari Kubiszyn KampakisColumnist, blogger at karikampakis.comWhat we may justify as \"good parenting\" can hurt our children later.
