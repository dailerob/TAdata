{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027It\u0027s hard to recall a time when the world presented more crises with fewer easy solutions. And for the Republicans, all of these woes have a common genesis: American weakness projected by Barack Obama. People in the Middle East, former Vice President Dick Cheney said recently, \"are absolutely convinced that the American capacity to lead and influence in that part of the world has been dramatically reduced by this president.\" He added, \"We\u0027ve got a problem with weakness, and it\u0027s centered right in the White House.\" Really? It\u0027s instructive to ask: What exactly would a Republican president advised by Cheney do in each of these crises? Let\u0027s take them one at a time.If established climate science, unfolding in real time before our eyes, does not prevail in the current Washington debate, then the fate of the world may look a lot like the dystopia popular in much of current cinema.Singer; Actress; Director; Composer; ActivistAfter watching continuous acts of police abuse and brutality from coast-to-coast, perhaps the real question is, have we reached a point where federal authorities need to step in?President, National Action NetworkCourtesy of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, Putin is now coming to terms with the blowback from his Ukrainian adventure, a hybrid non-linear political-military campaign fought largely through local proxies, and this is something that will dog him for as long as he is in power.Professor of Global Affairs at NYU’s Center for Global Affairs; Founding Editor of the journal \u0027Global Crime\u0027My CBPP colleague Chuck Marr flags something important from a recent press release by Rep. Dave Camp, the Republican Chair of the tax writing committee in the House. In just a few words, the Congressman manages to make some truly scary assertions.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorEarly last week, the drug firm Mylan stomped on the Stars and Stripes as it ditched America for the Netherlands. Then, on Friday, the drug company AbbVie similarly renounced America. For 30 pieces of silver, it will become Irish.International President, United SteelworkersIt is difficult to watch a war in real time. And the facts, and the causes, and the solutions all play second fiddle to the horror and tragedy of war. It makes compelling TV. And we learn nothing.Academy Award-winning director, screenwriter and producerFor those with bipolar disorder, it\u0027s an empowering message: No longer are you a prisoner of your genetics, thought to play a key role in the disorder. And through healthier lifestyle choices, you may be able to decrease your reliance on medication to manage your illness.Internationally recognized health expert, physician, scientist, and New York Times best-selling author. Known as \u0027the doc who walks the talk\u0027.Ed Miliband\u0027s visit to Washington DC provides a timely reminder of the new post-crash challenges faced by both our nations and our progressive movements. But beyond that, it is an opportunity for two leaders who both understand that economic growth comes from not the top down, but the middle out, and who share with common values, to share ideas on how to meet these challenges.Shadow Cabinet Minister, Labour peer and an adviser to Ed MilibandShadow Cabinet Minister, Labour peer and an adviser to Ed MilibandPerhaps the terrible truth of drug war violence will finally be addressed as all of America bore witness this summer to the horror of some 52,000 unaccompanied children who were fleeing devastating violence that had erupted in Central America.Award-Winning Author and JournalistMovement Building Team, Drug Policy AlliancePalestinians want to live normal lives. They want to be able to provide for their children and see their children\u0027s children grow and prosper. It is not, as the Israelis would say, that the Palestinians have chosen death. Rather, it is that the Israelis have never allowed them the chance to choose life.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027No matter what nonsense Rand Paul and the NRA promote about how doctors are a threat to the 2nd Amendment, anyone who believes that an unlocked gun in a home with children isn\u0027t a health risk is presenting a degree of stupidity that no amount of medical care will ever cure.Mike the Gun GuyFederal Reserve Board Chair Janet Yellen made waves in her Congressional testimony last week when she argued that social media and biotech stocks were over-valued. She also said that the price of junk bonds was out of line with historic experience. By making these assertions in a highly visible public forum, Yellen was using the power of the Fed\u0027s megaphone to stem the growth of incipient bubbles. This is an approach that some of us have advocated for close to twenty years.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Quick fixes can lead to quick results that quickly vanish. If you want lasting change, it\u0027s time to let go of instant gratification BS and find a new way to live. You can love how you look and feel (permanently) by developing decent habits that become second nature to you.National fitness expert, speaker, contributor to Prevention magazine, author of several books and fitness DVDsChaos is inevitable, and life is not always going to fall into place seamlessly. While the messy parts of life may not always be resolved positively, there is always a chance you\u0027ll find a rainbow at the end of the storm.Writer, coffee-addict and lover of being outdoorsSeventy-three years ago, Henry Luce, the publisher of Time and Life magazines, called on his countrymen to \"create the first great American Century.\" No one today could claim that this is Time\u0027s century, or the American Century, or perhaps anyone else\u0027s. Even the greatest empires now seem to have shortened lifespans.Editor, TomDispatch.comAn increasing number of people see zoos themselves as inherently problematic, and argue that even the best-funded, most conservation-minded institutions in which animals are kept on display should go the way of the dodo.Editor, HuffPost DCIt doesn\u0027t take long for kids, especially those with chronic issues, to develop phobias to doctors, specific offices and treatments. From my years as a waiting-room hopper, I\u0027ve learned how to make the best of doctor\u0027s visits for me and for the kids.Mom of two; \"Mothering Miracles\" bloggerNotwithstanding this controversy, this year\u0027s conference organizers deserve great praise for creating an event broad enough to contain multitudes. The open question is, What\u0027s happening to the broad and independent progressive movement which gave rise to the conference?Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourMalaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down in Ukraine last week because three crucial actors all played a role, and they all had something in common -- a desire for money.CEO, Country Risk SolutionsAs a nutritionist, I counsel many clients who know what foods to eat to lose weight and be healthy. However, even the most educated of consumers may have trouble determining how much to eat of these foods.Nationally-recognized nutritionist; International Speaker; Adjunct professor of nutrition at NYU; Author, \u0027The Portion Teller Plan\u0027If ever there were a time to rethink the objectives and premises of American strategy, it is now. Yet there are no signs from Washington that any systematic reappraisal is occurring.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghBy letting ourselves get lost in appointments, meetings and obligations, we risk missing out on enjoying what\u0027s truly important in life. Here are four takeaways I\u0027ve realized are crucial for thriving, especially for new moms who feel as though they have too much on their plates.Employee-transition expert with 10-plus years of experience in career developmentI loathe Putin the way I loathed George W. Bush. I didn\u0027t vote for either of them, and they each seemed hell-bent on rendering a country I love unrecognizable.Professor of Russian \u0026 Slavic Studies, New York UniversityRoe v. Wade, the landmark decision establishing a woman\u0027s right to an abortion, was issued 41 years ago. Despite consistent public opinion to the contrary, conservatives and the religious right have patiently and relentlessly campaigned against it for decades. And recently, their efforts are finding some success.Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyJoep and Jacqueline are gone, but what they\u0027ve left behind isn\u0027t just the long list of projects and activities they fostered. It\u0027s also the warmth and love that we, their friends and family, received from them, and that lives on in us. And that is an enormous consolation at this time of bewilderment and grief.Writer, art collector and AIDS activistAs my partner and I are both attorneys who work on and in support of public education, private school was not an option for us, so we decided to look for homes further out but with highly rated public schools. At the risk of sounding naïve, I was wholly unprepared for the reality that came with prioritizing high-quality public schools in my home search.Attorney at LawThe nine justices of the SCOTUS are now in recess, leaving the rest of us the summer in which to reflect upon and digest their latest set of rulings. Because it is likely that both judgments will have long-term adverse consequences for progressive causes, a moment of reflection on that second judgment is well in order.Worrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsThe outfit she wore in the \"Rude Boy\" music video is among the items featured in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum\u0027s Right Here, Right Now exhibit.You are not going to parent the right way. Nobody does. Parent your way. Ignore the advice you don\u0027t like, because if you think the way that somebody parents is crazy, they think the same about you.Dad, husband, author and Chief Content Creator at AtHomeDadMatters.comUntil someone on one side or the other finds the humility and wisdom to not shoot back, the human right to pursue happiness and raise our children in health and safety will never be a reality for some in some parts of the world.
