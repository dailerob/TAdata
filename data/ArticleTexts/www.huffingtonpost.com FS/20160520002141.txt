{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThe ITC just released its 792-page monster of a report on the “likely impact” of the TPP on the U.S. economy. The findings are largely positive on net but tiny, which confirms two of my priors. First, your support or opposition to the TPP can\u0027t be informed by these findings, and second, trade agreements, as opposed to trade, have little to do with U.S. growth and jobs.

Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Co-founder of Credit.com and IDT911Progressives owe a debt of gratitude to Bernie Sanders for what he\u0027s accomplished. But no matter what Bernie does or says or advises at July\u0027s Democratic Convention in Philadelphia, progressives must stay independent of Democratic elites.Author and media criticWhat we\u0027ve learned about Donald Trump\u0027s beliefs is that, before the media\u0027s outcry, he saw nothing wrong with women being jailed for having an abortion. Now, weeks after his campaign confronted a tsunami of pushback, his default position is to effectively shame women.Host of SiriusXM\u0027s The Agenda Sr. Fellow at People for the American WayI found David Samuels\u0027 storyline -- that portrays Ben Rhodes, the President\u0027s Deputy National Security Advisor, as the Manipulator in Chief -- to be a work of fiction and extremely condescending to members of Congress and all others who supported it.U.S. Representative for Illinois\u0027s 9th congressional districtOn World IBD Day, let\u0027s take the time to educate not only ourselves but also the general public about what IBD is and its impact on a patient\u0027s entire body and mind.

He learned so that we could learn.Host, \"Talk Back with Dr. Val\"Science continues to be an undercurrent of the GoT universe.

This has been the process through which Bernie Sanders\u0027 supporters travel. They don\u0027t get the math, so they continue to see his path, and if you disagree and speak to the realities of the campaign, you\u0027ll reap their wrath. And what\u0027s their main fuel?
