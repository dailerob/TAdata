{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Instead of investing in dirty fuels, let\u0027s start charging polluters for poisoning our skies -- and then invest the revenue so that it benefits everyone. Each ton of carbon that\u0027s released into the atmosphere costs our nation between $40 and $100, and we release millions of tons of it every year. Businesses don\u0027t pay that cost. They pass it along to the rest of us -- in the form of more extreme weather and all the costs to our economy and health resulting from it. We\u0027ve actually invested more than $6 trillion in fossil fuels since 2007. The money has been laundered through our savings and tax dollars. This has got to be reversed.\"All across the nation when they do projects like this,\" Walker said. \"It\u0027s a good deal.\" The Bucks franchise, valued at $600 million, is owned by a group of billionaire financiers in New York. But no matter what it\u0027s worth, Walker\u0027s statement is at wide variance with the findings of independent economists.Executive Vice President, Cato Institute; Author, \u0027The Libertarian Mind\u0027 (2015)The news of your death is heartbreaking, yet it has stirred my soul and inspired me to action. Its soul stirring because I refuse to let your death be in vain. I cannot, shall not and will not allow your story to go quietly away.Writer, mentor and motivational speakerSomething is rotten in the state of Michigan. One city neglected to inform its residents that its water supply was laced with cancerous chemicals. Another dissolved its public school district and replaced it with a charter school system, only to witness the for-profit management company it hired flee the scene.Author, \u0027A Dream Foreclosed\u0027I\u0027ve been working on the ground in Haiti with people who are heroic to me. It has bred this reflection. What my eyes have seen make me grateful to them. What my eyes have seen make me grateful to the American Red Cross.Academy Award-winning actor; Ambassador-at-Large for HaitiWhen members of Vice President Biden\u0027s staff get together to reminisce, so many of our fondest memories involve the Biden family: the times when Jill would plot elaborate practical jokes, or when Hunter would tell stories from his childhood. We were always so excited to see them. But we were never more excited than when we found out Beau was joining us.Former chief speechwriter to Vice President BidenAn anti-ISIS conference was held in Paris on June 2. The only armed forces that, so far, have stood up to the beheaders, the only ones capable of holding a front a thousand kilometers long, the only ones that have not yielded an inch of ground -- the Kurdish armed forces, the army of the Iraqi Kurds and its heroic Peshmerga -- were not invited.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.After five years of stall tactics and changing the rules to whatever suits him, Senator Ron Johnson long ago forfeited whatever deference he feels he is owed. The president has a list of names and he should act, selecting the nominee who will best protect the rights of everyday people in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin.President, Alliance for Justice and Alliance for Justice Action CampaignThe new rule in American politics is divide and conquer. That\u0027s how Barack Obama got re-elected in 2012. It\u0027s how Hillary Clinton and Scott Walker are aiming to win in 2016. You run on issues that define the election as \"us\" versus \"them.\"Professor, George Mason University; contributor, Al JazeeraThere\u0027s been a lot of talk about the place of women in country music lately, so it seems like the perfect time for two women to host the 2015 CMT Music Awards, and with any luck whatsoever, that is what we intend to do this Wednesday night on CMT.Sportscaster, journalist, and television personalityActressA governance revolution is underway, founded on the irresistible rise of cities and the ongoing decline of sovereign nation states. That revolution is already evident in countries from Italy and France to China and the United States and opens a chapter in the history of democracy in which public power is localized but not privatized and thus made more, rather than less, democratic.Democratic Theorist; Author, \u0027If Mayors Ruled the World\u0027 (Yale University Press); Founder, Global Parliament of MayorsIt is often said that the economy is too simple for economists to understand. This is clearly the story with the continuing weakness of the job market and the trade deficit. We are still down more than 3 million jobs from our trend level even with May\u0027s strong growth.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027For companies interested in retaining millennials, it\u0027s vital to infuse cause work into the corporate ethos, and then to structure the volunteer experience in ways that will be attractive to millennials.Founder and CEO, CausecastLast month, the Senate passed a bill that would take nearly $1 billion from Medicare to pay for Trade Adjustment Assistance. While protecting Americans against trade-related job losses is a critical priority, it should not come at the expense of seniors, the disability community, or their families.U.S. Representative for Illinois\u0027s 9th congressional districtPresident and CEO, National Committee to Preserve Social Security and MedicareWhat does the public think about automation and jobs? Do Americans see technological threats to employment, and have their views changed since the days when robots first began replacing line workers in factories?Research Coordinator for the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research at UConnThe truth is that the GOP knows it can\u0027t push its extreme, out-of-touch agenda on a country where every voice is heard. They know they have to do everything they can to silence the voices of everyday Americans because it\u0027s the only way they\u0027ll keep winning elections.President of EMILY\u0027s List and American WomenThere are still no Orange Mocha Frappuccinos on the books, but we trust Howard Schultz is just saving those for the 50th anniversary.Everything worth caring about in food, drink, and travelWhen someone dies it\u0027s such a private time and yet so very public. That\u0027s how I\u0027m feeling about the loss of my job. We didn\u0027t sit shiva only because CBS kicked us out so fast.Had a big job with David Letterman and now she doesn\u0027tHow can I summarize, Student, everything you have meant to me over the past eight months in just one little yearbook blurb? I have put so much energy into you -- into being able to teach you to the best of my ability. Yes, I will sign your yearbook. And I will never forget you.Coach\u0027s Wife, Mother of two, Educator, and Occasional Knitter.There is no logic in seeking a nuclear agreement with Iran while at the same time arming the very nations in the region that oppose the agreement.Iran News \u0026 Middle East ReportWhen blackness is conditioned into the psyche of a society as inherently bad, there is no such thing as children -- only blackness and the \"badness\" that comes with it. It is this ideology that leads adult white men -- police officers -- to use the kind of force we\u0027ve seen in the McKinney footage against black children.Author, blogger, and poet.When you\u0027re not paying attention to content and you\u0027re simply trying to indulge the delicate sensibilities of a society waiting to be outraged, you\u0027ve already lost.Comedian. Author. Idiot.Japan has always been Washington\u0027s number one Asian ally. That was demonstrated with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u0027s trip to Washington, highlighted by a speech to Congress. Unfortunately, the relationship increases the likelihood of a confrontation between the U.S. and China.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteCould the desire to add artistic value to the world be only human? It\u0027s a great debate.Associate Science Editor, The Huffington PostSome in Europe, especially in Germany, seem nonchalant about a Greek exit from the eurozone. The market has, they claim, already \"priced in\" such a rupture. I believe that such views significantly underestimate both the current and future risks involved.Professor at Columbia University and a Nobel Laureate in Economics96 percent of Americans agree that it is important to reduce the influence of money in elections. Just about the only people who disagree are five Supreme Court justices and the corrupt Congress who got elected through that money. Otherwise, real Republican, Democratic and independent voters all agree: If you take a lot of money from someone, you are likely to do what they ask you to do. This used to be called bribery.Host, \u0027The Young Turks\u0027In his near two decades\u0027 worth of experience as a foreign correspondent for prominent news outlets like the New York Times and NPR, Hedges has covered critical issues from all around the world, including his groundbreaking reporting on global terrorism.PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorWhat are Fox News Channel prime-time hosts like Bill O\u0027Reilly and Megyn Kelly thinking when they keep wailing and calling their audiences\u0027 attention to \"black-on-black violence?\"Executive Director, New York Civil Rights CoalitionWhen you\u0027re an introvert and you become a parent, your body goes through a little shock. Suddenly, you have very little alone time. Sure, your new baby is not talking to you -- and at times, not making much noise at all. But let\u0027s face it: You are never truly alone.Therapist, mom of 2 and co-blogger at Baby Proofed Parents, \"Where sane meets baby brain.\"We love good food here at Condé Nast Traveler. But we can\u0027t lie -- location matters, too.CondeNastTraveler.comFranklin Graham took to Facebook to announce he is moving his accounts to another bank to protest the Wells Fargo commercial featuring a lesbian couple. He is boycotting Tiffany\u0027s because they are selling wedding rings to gay couples.
