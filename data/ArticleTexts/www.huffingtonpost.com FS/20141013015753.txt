{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week the world was introduced to a glorious -- if unlikely -- new couple, united for all time by the matchmakers at the Norwegian Nobel Committee: Malala Yousafzai and Kailash Satyarthi, recipients of this year\u0027s Nobel Peace Prize. She\u0027s a 17-year-old Pakistani Muslim; he\u0027s a 60-year-old Indian Hindu. Together they\u0027re being honored for leading the fight for children\u0027s rights -- and against extremism -- worldwide. Malala, of course, is already well-known. After being shot by the Taliban in 2012 for trying to educate herself, she courageously spoke up even louder. \"They can only shoot a body; they cannot shoot my dreams,\" she said. Satyarthi, meanwhile, leads a consortium called the Global March Against Child Labor, a cause he\u0027s been championing for decades. There\u0027s a lot wrong with the world, and the committee\u0027s inspired choice is a reminder - and a challenge -- that we can all do more to make it a better place.The knowledge and infrastructure to treat the sick and contain the virus exists in high- and middle-income counties. So now thousands of people in these countries are dying because, in the lottery of birth, they were born in the wrong place.President, World Bank GroupWe owe our children the healthiest start to life, and this obligation includes heeding the sound advice of medical professionals in making critical health decisions for our families.Film director and co-founder, Parents\u0027 Action for ChildrenTo everyone who has been a part of this vibrant community, may our second year be as exciting and fulfilling -- and as free of late-night emails -- as the first. Happy birthday, congratulations and gratitude from all your HuffPost siblings across the world.Bringing a country or a region out of conflict has taken leaders coming from the ground up, not leaders installed by a super power to serve its economic interests. There is one word today that such leaders seem to understand, repeat, and live by that seems to separate their successes from failures elsewhere. The word is inclusion.Archbishop Emeritus of Cape TownArchbishop Emeritus of Cape TownRather than pitting our needs against our children\u0027s, parenting mindfully involves cultivating an awareness, right in such moments, of how our needs are interdependent. Our lives are undeniably deeply connected.Author, \u0027Mindfulness for Beginners: Reclaiming the Present Moment -- and Your Life\u0027While many difficult scientific issues remain to be resolved, one thing is clear: WHO and its scientific and industry partners are making sure that no stone is left unturned, that no international standards for safety and quality are compromised.Director-General of the World Health OrganizationAssistant Director-General at the World Health Organization (WHO)Ebola came to our church, even though no one was exposed to the virus inside our building. We encountered Ebola because one of our members came face-to-face with it. And to echo the words of the Apostle Paul, when one member of the body hurts, the entire body feels pain.Senior Pastor, Wilshire Baptist ChurchMegan Wakefield. Major, United States Army. Paratrooper, 82nd Airborne Division.Lawyer.Senior Military Correspondent, The Huffington PostThe UN Security Council is the only UN body with real power and may influence positively the course of events when the 15 members agree on a course of action.

Otherwise the bombs will reign for decades.Veteran journalist reporting from the United NationsWe often boast of the uniqueness of our system. We are not a totalitarian society that crushes the individual out of existence and tramples over his/her rights and freedoms. But there are questions we need to ask ourselves.British Tunisian writer and Middle East expertDecades of observation, monitoring, and research have demonstrated beyond a doubt that the Earth\u0027s climate is changing, that greenhouse gas emissions from human activities are to blame, and that the consequences will be devastating unless the world gets serious about reducing emissions. This is not a distant or future challenge. Climate change is affecting millions around the world right now -- today.U.S. Secretary of StateWe need to wake up and realize all children, especially those of color -- girls and boys -- need adults to stop criminalizing them and recognize the special risks facing our girls.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundAmid the waves of fear and continual headlines about terror plots, we, the people, have now largely been relegated to the role of so many frightened spectators when it comes to our government and its actions. Welcome to the Terrordome.Editor, TomDispatch.comBy the time I started school, my mother\u0027s bulimia was a normal part of my life. But as I grew, her focus on my looks and her fears weighed heavily on me. It would take me years to figure out that it was never about me at all.Writer and healthcare scientist.Today the Supreme Court announced it would not hear a marriage equality case in the near future, turning down several appeals of lower court rulings that voided bans on same-sex marriage.Professor of Law, UCLADo you ever wonder about the meaning of life, and in particular your life? Well, of course you do, but maybe you should ease up on the angst. There are academics who say you don\u0027t have a life. You\u0027re just an app.Senior Astronomer, SETI InstituteOn this International Day of the Girl, let us shelter and support young girls\u0027 dreams, and help those millions of tiny flames become a sun that lights the sky.Actress, Co-founder of Chime for ChangeConfidence can be a rare commodity most particularly for mothers, especially when there\u0027s always someone out there critiquing parenting performance. Thankfully, confidence, like parenting, can be learned.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarOver time, the nature of medicine has changed. There is ever less time with patients. There is ever more reliance on technology and drugs. These can offer powerful benefits, but at times there are kinder, gentler modalities to get the same job done.Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterAn elite few who take large sums from Big Pharma very likely sway decision making by countless other physicians, who might not even know they are getting a choreographed, yet subtle, sell-job.Author, \"Unaccountable\"The NRA fully understands the racial dynamic at play here. As long as we can blame something other than guns, America will not have to come to terms with the truth that violence is a complicated phenomenon that is made far more lethal by the easy availability and killing power of firearms.Executive Director, Coalition to Stop Gun ViolenceAs the drama unfolds and fingers of blame are pointed at the Secret Service over recent breaches of security at the White House, we have a bit of good news/bad news to report.Despite what the media might tell women, you don\u0027t have to choose one way of life over the other forever. You can, in fact, change your mind. You can choose and re-choose the direction of your own adventure.EVP and President Americas at Levi Strauss \u0026 Co.We are having the wrong debate.

But often banks hear something else -- they hear something has led lenders to deny the home mortgage loans for expecting families.Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban DevelopmentI often figure those who know me from PTA or the bus stop or the grocery store would naturally assume I would condemn criminals and bad guys and extremists of every sort, but apparently, since I\u0027m Muslim, the condemnation has to be signed, sealed and delivered to make it stick.Muslim American Writer, Activist, MomGiven the length of the infiltration and the fact that not one of the 83 million accounts affected got drained, it seems unlikely that theft of funds was the immediate goal of the breach. The more likely scenario is that we are watching a multi-layered crime unfold in real time.Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"CDC BRACES FOR MORE CASES",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
