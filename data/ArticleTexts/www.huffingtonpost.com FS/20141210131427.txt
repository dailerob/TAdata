Had they, we simply wouldn\u0027t be here today. If there is any positive to come out of the release of this report, and turmoil that may come as a result of facts being released, let it be, finally, a wake-up call. Let it lead to the American people immediately disqualifying any candidate for president, in 2016, who won\u0027t clearly and definitively rule out the use of torture by intelligence or military under their administration. Let it serve as a reminder of our duty to hold our elected officials accountable for what they do, or plan to do, in our name. And let it remind us that the reasons against torture are more than just moral ones. They\u0027re quite practical, too.I have forgotten most of them, and so has the public. However, I am proud of the ones I will tell you about. A few are sentimental favorites that mark meaningful times in my off-screen life and milestones in my rise to stardom.

I am only ignored. In 13 years of imprisonment without charge, I\u0027ve never been able to tell anyone who I really am. I am not ISN 026. That is the government\u0027s number. My name is Fahd Abdullah Ahmed Ghazy. I am a human being -- a man -- who is loved and who loves.Detainee, Guantánamo BayDo not be silent. Do not be complacent. Do not continue to live with police misconduct and violence as somehow acceptable. We are not anti-police; we are anti-police-brutality. And today we challenge Congress to follow in the president\u0027s footsteps and take legislative action to protect us, the citizens.President, National Action NetworkRevenge doesn\u0027t bring anyone back. But prevention saves lives. If you can stop a young boy from becoming an offender, you can save women like my aunt, Kat, or me.Building to One Billion Rising REVOLUTIONCure Violence appreciates that kids killing kids is the product of biological and group processes. This type of violence is a learned behavior: proximity and ongoing exposure to violence in a community triggers youth to imitate what they see.Medical director, New York State Office of Mental HealthWith torture we get the worst of both worlds: We gather no useful intelligence and we undermine our reputation as a democratic government of principles.Scientist and former White House Senior Policy Analyst; Ph.D. in marine biology/neurophysiologyA Republican-chaired committee report that debunks Benghazi conspiracies is now being used as a rallying cry for conservatives who are convinced the report raises more pressing questions. Do you see where this closed, hermetically sealed loop is designed to lead us?Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaThe reason Democrats have pulled their punches with the financial sector for years is because it\u0027s hard to punch the hand that feeds you. This must stop. America can\u0027t tackle widening inequality without confronting the power and privilege lying behind it.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Love doesn\u0027t mean that you have to stay, and stay and stay. You can leave the relationship and love them anyway.Professor. TV \u0026 Radio Personality. Keynote Speaker. Coach. Author. Proud Mom. Lover of Life. Bad Cook.In regard to fossil fuel companies directly engaged in extractive activities, it is unrealistic to imagine them being swayed by shareholder arguments to get out of their core business of exploring for, extracting and selling carbon-emitting fuel.Former SEC CommissionerThis movie is about you, and it is about me, and you absolutely must see it. \"Selma\" is about the very soul of America in 1965 and, in an eerie twist of timing, it is about the very soul of America right now, this minute.Author, Host \"Dr. Phil\"His brutal, unpredictable dictatorship has disappeared, but in its place has emerged a blander, more prosaic and bureaucratic authoritarian system. Still, the Chinese people remain in chains, though their fetters now are gold and silver.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteWhile it\u0027s very tempting to curl up in front of the TV on winter nights and mindlessly drown in your favorite show, doing so will make your brain lethargic, and winter\u0027s only just started!Productivity blogger and happiness life hackerThe ousting of three-term U.S. Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-Louisiana) from her seat in the U.S. Senate by U.S. Rep. Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana) put the capper on the white Southern flip-flop from Democrat to Republican. The stock explanation for this change is race, gut there\u0027s another explanation for the GOP\u0027s lock on Southern whites that\u0027s every bit as compelling.Author and political analystMitt Romney is leading the field of potential Republican candidates in a recent national Quinnipiac University survey. While this might sounds impressive, it is important to recall that Mitt Romney faces long odds to being elected president in 2016.Statistician and health economist for the United Nations; Teacher, Columbia UniversityElections are behind us, and many new state legislative sessions don\u0027t begin until January -- yet lawmakers are already giving us a preview of the bills they intend to pass into law first chance they get.President of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Planned Parenthood Action Fund and Planned Parenthood VotesGreetings from India, where I\u0027m thrilled to announce we\u0027re launching our latest international edition, in collaboration with The Times of India Group and its digital arm, Times Internet (TIL).We cannot wait months for the legislature to act.

Because it carries the echo of the creeping devastation. And because the author proves that there is, in the ruins, another way to live. Not anger, not nostalgia, but insurrection through style.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.Next time, why not have parades to celebrate those who tried to prevent that grim, still ongoing conflict from starting? Of course, there\u0027s an even better way to honor and thank veterans of the struggle for peace: Don\u0027t start more wars.Author, \u0027To End All Wars: A Story of Loyalty and Rebellion, 1914-1918\u0027Remember to be open and receptive. Don\u0027t necessarily expect an apology or a reconciliation right away, as that will take you out of a place of love and back into ego.

Now, a new protest movement against racist injustice -- triggered by the killings of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, and the failure of the criminal justice to indict their killers -- has propelled Obama to recall his community organizing roots.E.P.
