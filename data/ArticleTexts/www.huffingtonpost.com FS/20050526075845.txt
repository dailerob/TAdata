The women did great. Then they broke the groups into teams. The women did great. Then they asked, “Who wants to be in a tournament?” Even the worst performing men wanted to be in the tournament. And guess what…the women weren’t so keen. Even the best said no thanks. Tierney’s conclusion was women don’t like to compete.

Their ongoing feud with the Bloods has cost thousands of lives, decimated a once-proud community and poisoned it with drugs. He has been on San Quentin’s death row for over a quarter of a century and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals just denied his latest appeal. Why should you care?read whole post | permalink | comments (3)05.25.2005 Paul RieckhoffYou wrote: \"I\u0027m not a congressman, I\u0027m a comedian. There\u0027s nothing I can really do to help or hurt our troops.\" You\u0027re wrong, Bill. There is plenty you can do. Get some troops on your show! America has heard enough from retired Generals, policy wonks and reporters who spent the war sitting comfortably behind air-conditioned desks in DC while we were getting blown up in Baghdad.read whole post | permalink05.25.2005 Paul FeigNice to see President Bush on the front page of the New York Times holding up a baby to show the world how immoral stem cell research is. Does this mean I get to dig up the corpse of my father who died from Parkinsons disease and stand him up in front of the White House to show my support for stem cell research?read whole post | permalink05.26.2005 Laurie DavidIf a tradition-bound Japanese culture can shift with the times and embrace the idea of expanding casual Friday to five days a week, perhaps our administration, encrusted in its oil and auto culture, can shift too.

As Jo Ann Emerson, an anti-abortion Missouri Republican who was among the 50 GOP House members to bolt the party line on the stem-cell vote, put it, \"Who can say that prolonging a life is not pro-life?\"read whole post | permalink | comments (0)05.25.2005 Zachary J. IscolI had the pleasure and great honor to serve with Sergeant Byron Norwood. He may have joined the Marine Corps for lofty ideals, but he fought and gave his life because of his love for the Marines he served alongside. Byron showed us that while war may be the embodiment of evil and hell -- it is also a place of great love and compassion for one’s fellow man.read whole post | permalink | comments (0)05.25.2005 Robert SchlesingerIs there any major company left in the world that is even remotely concerned with individual customer service? The answer is probably not. Why? Because as individual consumers, we\u0027re irrelevent to them. If companies screw me and I vow to never use their services again it makes absolutely no difference to them.read whole post | permalink | comments (2)05.25.2005 Earl Ofari HutchinsonWhen the chips were down with Clarence Thomas, conservatives used race to trump politics. The black brother under attack theme helped narrowly put him over the top in the Senate and on the high court. Now it’s the black sister under attack theme with Janice Brown. GOP conservatives hope their Thomas playbook plan will work with her too.read whole post | permalink | comments (0)05.25.2005 Greg GutfeldFirst, thanks to Richard Bradley for donating the Miniwallet Pen. It clips in your wallet or filofax – but when extended it fits nicely in your hand and writes beautifully. Slight smell. two dollars.From Walter Cronkite, this TV and radio antenna simply plugs into your tv, without the need for ugly outdoor aerials, eliminating \"ghosting,\" or poor reception. Just remove it from the helmet, and it’s as good as new. One dollar.read whole post | permalink05.25.2005 Cable NeuhausYesterday, bearing Huffington Post press tags (thus the first HuffPo contributor to be so adorned?), I attended the World Magazine Congress at New York\u0027s Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Given the somewhat diminishing influence of mags in the U.S., I thought it was worth sharing a few of the highlights from the sessions I attended.read whole post | permalink05.25.2005 Jim LampleyThe cretins in the Bush Administration are no doubt thrilled to have made Amnesty International\u0027s select list of human rights abusers. They\u0027re actually being cited there for some of their smaller crimes. The biggest one was domestic, not international. Read on, if you care. I pray to all the traditions of democracy that you do.read whole post | permalink | comments (9)05.25.2005 Danielle CrittendenPart I: Commitments on Pending Summer Holiday A. We have invoked cloture on a beach house in North Carolina for the last week of July. B. Mommy will withdraw her demand that Daddy sleep in the spare room; Daddy may now return to sleeping in the master bedroom. C. Daddy withdraws his nomination for the golf resort. D. Mommy and Daddy will accede to the children’s demand to visit a Six Flags theme park at some point during the holiday. However, aforementioned visit will take place only on a weekday when the theme park is less crowded...read whole post | permalink05.25.2005 Bree WalkerSomewhere in your family genetics lurks a horrifying truth: a hereditary disease or painful disability that could likely be wiped out by the use of stem cells. Watching my mother and father die long, painful deaths from cancer and diabetes convinced me that I needed to promote stem cell research here in the country where we had a leading edge. That is, until the Bush Administration and the religious (but not) right put a halt to all of it.read whole post | permalink05.25.2005 Bill MaherI can see why administration supporters would want to deflect attention away from the gist of what I was saying, which was this: now that we can\u0027t meet our recruiting goals, maybe it\u0027s the people who were so gung ho for this war to begin with who should step up and go fight it. But of course it\u0027s always easier to distract people.read whole post | permalink","h1":"US \u0027Thumbs Its Nose\u0027 at Rights, Says Amnesty",".title":"","h2":"On The Blog NowThe NY Times Has No Idea \"What Women Want\"Don\u0027t Execute Co-Founder of CripsBill Maher, You Are Wrong!Equal time, please.Casual Friday Fights Global WarmingGrim Reaper PoliticsMemorial DayHow I Love \"Customer Service\"Conservatives Snatch Page From Thomas Play Book For BrownHUFFPO GARAGE SALE FOR CHARITYReport from the World Magazine CongressRevisiting the Biggest Story of Our LivesMemorandum of Understanding on This Year’s Family VacationStem Cells Our Only HopeFruit","h3":"",".snippet":"","h4":"Senate Confirms Judicial Nominee OwenConservatives: McCain Will \u0027Suffer\u0027 Over Filibuster DealPoll: Voters Back Roe v.
