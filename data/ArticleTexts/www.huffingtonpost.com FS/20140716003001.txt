{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor of law and political science, Yale; Author \u0027The Decline and Fall of the American Republic\u0027It\u0027s taken a long time for Germany and Japan to recover from the Second World War. After enduring the indignity of military occupation, they regained sovereignty only by guaranteeing against future threats to peace. Germany\u0027s new constitution only authorized military force in self-defense or in collaboration with collective security agreements. Japan\u0027s Article Nine went further, \"forever renounc[ing] ... the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes.\" But this post-war settlement is unraveling before our eyes. The Obama administration must learn to distinguish the urgent from the truly fundamental. Unless it rethinks our traditional post-war partnerships, it risks an authoritarian Japan and a profoundly alienated Germany -- destroying one of the greatest legacies of the twentieth century.Perpetually busy, we lose ourselves in endless tasks. Then, all of a sudden, the universe hits us with a reminder. For me, the past month has been that reminder.Deputy CEO, US Private Bank, J.P. MorganIf Steinbeck\u0027s woman character is purely a victim, why is she so hated? And if she is truly harmless, why is she so threatening? Without question, it was a commentary on the social climate at the time, which still surprisingly applies today.ActressFor the past week I have instituted a no-using-my-iPhone-at-night life policy. And even though it\u0027s only been one week and I have fallen off the wagon twice, it\u0027s made a huge difference.ComedianTonight, at the All Star Game, Major League Baseball will honor a great, brave man -- an athlete who had to hide behind fear and shame while still trying to live up to his God given potential as a ball player.Actress and children\u0027s book authorThe floor felt like solid concrete with no softness or give. The room was long and narrow, angling to a point at the end. The ceilings about 12 feet high. Suddenly, one of the sleeping men lying below the bench pushed my blanket away.LA-based attorneyBarack Obama\u0027s Justice Department on Monday announced that Citigroup would pay $7 billion in fines, a move that will avoid a humiliating trial dealing with the seamy financial products the bank had marketed to an unsuspecting public, causing vast damage to the economy.Editor,Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027Walking home from the Capitol recently, I saw the words engraved above the portico of the Supreme Court: \"Equal justice under law.\" They don\u0027t say \"equal justice under law except for women.\" They don\u0027t say \"equal justice as long as it\u0027s OK with your boss.\" And yet that is exactly what the court majority said in its ruling.U.S. Senator from CaliforniaProviding a safe place for girls and women to pursue their education is the best vehicle we know for combating poverty, disease and economic injustice. The demand that girls and women have a right to a full and equal education is not a parochial Western value -- it is a fundamental human right.President, Wesleyan UniversitySuddenly, that person you fell in love with is kissing his daughter\u0027s boo-boos, tossing his son in the air and working to support a family. Just as I fell in love with my spouse, every day I fall in love with this man who is traveling with me on this crazy adventure called parenthood.Author, blogger at MommyAtoZBlog.comAfter a recent public talk, I shocked the crowd by admitting that the Levi\u0027s jeans I was wearing that day \"hadn\u0027t seen the inside of a washing machine.\" Now, everywhere I go, the first thing people say to me is \"Oh, you\u0027re the guy who never washes his jeans!\"President and CEO of Levi Strauss \u0026 CoAmericans across the country have been grappling with a range of severe, climate change-related weather events, including prolonged droughts, extreme precipitation, heat waves and, like Florida, coastal flooding. And majorities in both blue and red districts want federal action.Director of News \u0026 Commentary, Union of Concerned ScientistsUnder cover of \"the defense of Palestine,\" thousands gathered in Paris on Sunday to blame the Jews once again. They need to be reminded, for what it\u0027s worth, that conflating Jews and Israelis in the same condemnation is the very principle of anti-Semitism, which, in France, is punishable by law.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.The next time you hear about migrant children near the border, just picture them as your own. Then think what you would want our government to do.President, National Action NetworkThe federal government is one of the world\u0027s biggest consumers. These hundreds of billions of dollars in purchases and investments are a driving force of the American economy -- procurement creates jobs, promotes innovation and even has socially beneficial effects. It also is often associated with outsourcing waste and fraud and crony capitalism.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorHeadlines in the mainstream media falsely portray an equivalence of firepower between Israelis and Palestinians in Gaza. But Israel\u0027s use of force greatly exceeds that of the Palestinians, and the asymmetric warfare continues to escalate.Professor, Thomas Jefferson School of LawPublishing today is characterized by powerful corporate entities acting in concert to the detriment of essentially powerless authors. Something must be done to remedy the situation because it\u0027s driving a lot of good writers out of publishing.Author of \u0027Muhammad Ali: His Life And Times\u0027 and over 40 other booksIt\u0027s time to be intentional and make working out your heart as important as working out your body, not just for the health benefits but also to be your best self and contribute to a better world.HuffPost Blog/Third Metric FellowBelieve it or not, right now some Republicans are working feverishly to get support for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act in the GOP and try to pass it in the House in this session, with the dangerous religious exemption that caused LGBT groups to withdraw support. The irony here is off the charts.Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesThe latest session of the US Supreme Court was especially contentious, with important decisions on the separation of church and state, organized labor, campaign finance reform, birth control and women\u0027s health, among others, splitting the court along its 5-4 conservative-liberal divide.Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyNo new emails while you\u0027re on the phone? No big deal. Probably shouldn\u0027t be reading emails while on the phone anyway, right? But dig deeper and you realize how hobbled a smartphone is if it can\u0027t transmit data when it\u0027s being used for its primary function.EVP Operations, BiTE interactiveMarlon Brando died on July 1, 2004. Now in the aftermath of the tenth anniversary of his death, it is time to acknowledge what has been overlooked: that our foremost American actor had a mind.Professor, Author of Brando’s Smile: His Life, Thought, and WorkAnecdotal evidence that Comcast\u0027s shoddy customer service practices disappoint consumers is overwhelming and warrants consumer protection. Its customer support is poor because most Americans have no other provider in their area.Law Student, University of MichiganIf you have to find legal ways to hide the way you do business, that\u0027s the first sign that there is something wrong with the way you do business.Vocalist, Rise AgainstFor some, it\u0027s just a breakdown of law and order. For others, it\u0027s a moral challenge beyond ideology. And, quite reasonably, opponents of immigration are waiting to see how Progressive states react to requests to share the burden. Especially New York.Senior Fellow, DemosIt is striking to see how the establishment types are willing to throw out all their rules and principles in order to secure re-authorization. Given their power, they will almost certainly win, but the rest of us should at least enjoy the show.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027For me, if sex is not akin to a glass of well-aged Rioja -- spicy, tantalizing, with a good, strong finish -- then it\u0027s just better not to have it at all.Screenwriter, Writer, Bon VivantLess than three years ago, Rick Perry showed himself to be an extraordinarily bad campaigner with a tin ear for retail politics. Yet today, Perry is touted by the Beltway press as a \"handsome\" and \"underrated\" campaigner who stands poised for greatness in the next presidential campaign. Somewhere Al Gore must be shaking his head.Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaThere are too many wounds and grievances on either side to make bilateral negotiations between Israel and Palestine a success. By calling for a pact between Israel and Hamas, the United Nations is only postponing the next inevitable round of violence to another day.A member of the Hashemite Royal Family working to address issues such as regional integration, inter-faith dialogues, water, energy and the human environment and human dignity.In 1992, a 44-year-old attorney made the following remarkable assertion: \"For goodness\u0027 sake, you can\u0027t be a lawyer if you don\u0027t represent banks.\" The attorney was Hillary Clinton.Author and media criticA $7 billion settlement against a too-big-to-fail bank? What\u0027s not to love? We\u0027ll answer that with another question: If the settlement that the Justice Department just negotiated with Citigroup is meant as punitive, why did Citigroup\u0027s stock go up when the deal was announced?Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"POPE: WELCOME THEM",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
