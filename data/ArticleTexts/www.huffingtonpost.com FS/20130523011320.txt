{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoStriking the right balance between the government\u0027s legitimate need for confidentiality, the press\u0027 legitimate need to obtain information about government action, and the public\u0027s \"right to know\" what its representatives are up to, is a difficult and delicate task. All three branches of the federal government have a role to play in striking this balance. The president can exercise restraint (indeed, no reporter has ever been criminally prosecuted for soliciting classified information, even though it is apparently a common practice), the Congress can (and should) enact laws defining criminal conduct in this context more clearly, and the judiciary can better define the protections of the First Amendment. All three branches need to think harder about this issue.Comments (295)Trita ParsiPresident, National Iranian American CouncilWhile a very slight glimmer of hope existed after the fraudulent elections in 2009 that the negative trajectory could be reversed through the ballot box, even that small probability may now have been eliminated.Comments (50)Mattea Kramer and Jo ComerfordIt\u0027s 2023 -- and this is America 10 years after the first across-the-board federal budget cuts known as sequestration went into effect.Comments (1,247)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorBecause they can indefinitely shield their foreign profits from U.S. taxes, meanwhile engaging in endless (legal) schemes to avoid taxes in countries where they book those earnings, the link between the profitability of American companies and the well-being of America is broken.Comments (158)Maureen RyanTV critic, The Huffington PostOne thing is clear from this episode, which was amped up and tap-filled and yet came off as filler: Good Lord, those flashbacks to Young Dick Whitman have to go.Comments (19)Amitai EtzioniProfessor of international relations, George Washington UniversityThe president is either moping or muttering defensively about the abuses by the IRS and the tragedy of Benghazi. As I see it, if he wakes up tomorrow and is willing to speak up, there are a few things he could fairly state. First, any suggestion that \"the IRS\" went after the Tea Party are bogus.Comments (180)Beth WoolseyWriter, humorist at the Five Kids Is A Lot of Kids blogIf you pay attention, kids will teach you how to laugh loudly, how to love deeply and how to live fully. They will also ruin all your stuff.Comments (57)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; host, \u0027The Breakdown\u0027; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureApple\u0027s $100 billion in offshore profits is managed in Reno, tracked by accountants in Austin, and stored in Manhattan banks. That\u0027s called having your apple and eating it too. It\u0027s up to our leaders, not corporate executives, to fix this problem.Comments (27)Meaghan GarveyIllustrator, writerKanye West is white America\u0027s worst nightmare. Because as much as one may attempt to dismiss him, you still have to turn on your regularly scheduled late night comedy program and stare him in the face. You can\u0027t avoid Kanye. He\u0027s made very sure of that.Comments (126)Hollye Harrington JacobsNurse, Social Worker, Educator, Author www.TheSilverPen.comThe important thing to know is that children take their coping cues from us, the trusted adults in their lives. This isn\u0027t to say that we should cover our emotions. Not at all. Rather, we need to model healthy coping mechanisms for our children.Comments (30)Wray HerbertAuthor, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027The elderly have never been honored in American society. They have more often been stereotyped, stigmatized and pitied. And according to Princeton University psychological scientist Susan Fiske, this unfair ageist stereotyping could become even darker with the new influx of seniors.Comments (213)Dr. John PierceWellness SpecialistDoctors and therapists often encourage people to decrease stress and \"stop and smell the roses,\" but how can you accomplish this when your day-to-day life is hectic and overwhelming? Here are a few simple lifestyle changes you can make to help reduce stress and improve your quality of life.CommentsKen HarbaughExecutive Director, ServiceNationI realize how lucky I am. I have a job I love, with health care, and a family I can talk to whenever I want -- thank you Skype. But every time I fall asleep in some distant hotel room, I ask myself, \"Is what I did today worth more than tucking my kids into bed?\"Comments (26)Rep. Steny Hoyer and Rep. Barbara LeeFrom infants to seniors, the sequester affects at-risk Americans in every age bracket, and its cuts will harm families trying to put food on the table. Simply put, the sequester will erect road blocks along the pathways out of poverty.Comments (197)Nico LangBlogger; correspondent, WBEZTwo-thirds of our most hated celebrities are women, and females count for seven of the top 10 slots. What makes Gwyneth Paltrow 20 times more hateable than Chris Brown?Comments (47)Jennifer Rowe WaltersMother, Wife, OkieTornadoes. For me and my fellow Okies, it\u0027s probably one of the first words we hear as children. We play \"tornado\" with our friends. But this. This is something that no amount of experience, no ingrained, Okie-native understanding of the weather or geography can ever prepare you for.Comments (83)Bob GreensteinFounder and President, Center on Budget \u0026 Policy PrioritiesIn today\u0027s Senate debate on the farm bill, Senator David Vitter offered -- and Senate Democrats accepted -- an amendment that would increase hardship and will likely have strongly racially discriminatory effects.Comments (43)Ocean RobbinsAuthor, Speaker, www.foodrevolution.orgHave you noticed that when it comes to food policy, the U.S. Congress isn\u0027t always an unflinching champion of the public interest? Today, you have an opportunity to do something about that.CommentsU.S. News TravelU.S. News \u0026 World Report TravelA disappointing french fry is hard to come by, but which eateries make the cut as America\u0027s finest potato-handlers?Comments (25)Jeb BushFormer governor of FloridaMost Americans agree that coming to the United States legally should be easier and with less cost than coming to the country illegally. Unfortunately, right now, that is not the case.Comments (135)Marcus SamuelssonAward-Winning Chef, Restaurateur \u0026 AuthorChildren want to mimic adults. They notice when you choose to prepare fresh vegetables over calling in another pizza pie for dinner. They will see that food made with love and care outweighs going through the drive-through window.CommentsJoanna MontgomeryWife, mother, writer, survivorWe all know that cancer changes a person forever. It clearly changes us physically. It also changes us emotionally. Now here\u0027s the part no one really tells you: Cancer really does a number on your sexuality, especially us women.Comments (19)Ramzi KassemProfessor, City University of New York School of LawIn his years in office, Obama has retreated from the moral argument against Guantánamo. If he is serious about closing the prison and not repeating the errors of the past, then he should reclaim that moral high ground.CommentsElliott NeginDirector of News \u0026 Commentary, Union of Concerned ScientistsGiven the Heartland Institute\u0027s penchant for misrepresenting science, you would think reporters would be curious about who finances its work. You would be wrong.Comments (28)MeatheadAmazingRibs.com, Barbecue Whisperer, Hedonism Evangelist, OmnivoreThe best smokers to buy this summer.Comments (12)Peter Dreier and Richard AppelbaumIf journalism\u0027s role is to not only report the facts but also to expose wrongdoing, then the Times deserves kudos, and a Pulitzer Prize, for documenting and explaining the emergence of Bangladesh\u0027s new sweatshop economy as a major source of the clothing that American and European consumers buy every day.Comments (13)Joe RobinsonWork-life balance, stress management educator, speaker, and author, \u0027Work to Live\u0027\u0027There seems to be a trend here. Illness and stress. Spending wild amounts of money and stress. The culprit behind so many of our health problems is staring us in the face. Want to cut chronic diseases and health bills? Start with stress, the crisis at the heart of the health care crisis.CommentsAllen FrancesProfessor Emeritus, Duke UniversityMay has been a dispiriting month for psychiatry and a sad and worrying time for our patients. Three of the leading mental health organizations have squabbled among themselves -- promoting silly and competing \u0027paradigm shifts\u0027 while ignoring the unmet needs of our patients.Comments (25)Sec. Kathleen SebeliusSecretary of Health and Human ServicesThis is a time when you\u0027re making big decisions about the future. You might be embarking on a new career, transitioning to a different city. I\u0027m sure the last thing you\u0027re thinking about is health insurance. But unfortunately, the unexpected can happen.CommentsRoya R. Rad, MA, PsyDFaculty of psychology, ECPI UniversityAt the end, positive thinkers are better problem solvers and have better interactions. In addition to that, people who are positive thinkers are happier and more satisfied with their life.Comments (33)Grover NorquistPresident, Americans for Tax ReformAmerica is the most immigrant-friendly nation in the world and we are also the richest; that is not a coincidence. Immigrants have been coming to our shores since the Pilgrims landed and they bring with them determination, innovation, and the entrepreneurial spirit that built this great nation.Comments (33)Kristin Braswell, 2013.22.05Pure Adventures Travel, 2013.22.05Jeffery Self, 2013.22.05Nancy Schwartzman, 2013.22.05Rob Watson, 2013.22.05Arianna Huffington, 2013.22.05Chuck Gomez, 2013.22.05Chris Weigant, 2013.22.05Dan Duffy, 2013.22.05Jama Shelton, 2013.22.05Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"GOV\u0027T ADMITS IT: WE KILLED 4 AMERICANS",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
