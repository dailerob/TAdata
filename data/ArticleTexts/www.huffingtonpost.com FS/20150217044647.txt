{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorStop the foolishness and talk to us like grownups. There will be no \"trade war\" if we pursue a currency chapter in the TPP. There will be a lot of arguing and negotiating about what technically constitutes currency manipulation to gain an edge in trade. It could blow up the deal, and Secretary Lew, Rep. Ryan, and others should explain to us and to members of Congress why that\u0027s a more costly outcome to American workers and businesses than continuing to live with labor demand-draining trade deficits. If they can do so, then let\u0027s have a TPP. If they can neither make a convincing case based on facts, not war-mongering and fear tactics, nor can they offer a convincing alternative for legislative actions outside of the TPP against currency manipulation, then they must either negotiate a currency chapter or accept defeat.The first presidential primary is underway, not simply because the political press cannot wait but because he or she who signs up the most megabucks wins that primary and is well on the way to a nomination. Step right up and participate--that is if you can write a very large check.United States Senator (Ret.)For several days now, I\u0027ve been struggling to understand why I\u0027m so out of the loop on this one. It\u0027s not because I don\u0027t like experimental films or Richard Linklater. I didn\u0027t like Boyhood because it wasted my time with mostly unlikable characters, generally bad storytelling, and a whole lot of nothing.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027To be the guest of a great lord in his castle was an honor reserved for notable visitors known to the host, but others would arrive with a letter of introduction from the king or queen or a member of their family or friends of the host.Author and Historian; author of the acclaimed Anjou Trilogy and frequent lecturer and historical writer.The Copenhagen killings are reviving the Charlie Hebdo experience. The dramatic video, the bloodied office, the manhunt, the hostages, the outrage, the marches, the ubiquitous Je Suis Charlie placards. And then the politicians\u0027 pledges, the analysis, the endless commentaries.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghAm I black in a cop\u0027s hands when he is pushing, pressing hard for dope or a gun or a rope or a knife or a fist? I am not a black body, yet my body is somehow, somewhere, theirs -- Trayvon\u0027s, Emmett\u0027s, thousands more at the end of a rope\u0027s tight murderous swing.Writer, JournalistI\u0027ve seen first-hand how effective Wall Street and big corporations are at wielding influence. Global deals like the Trans Pacific Partnership will boost the profits of Wall Street and big corporations, and make the richest 1 percent even richer. But they\u0027ll bust the rest of America.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027America is the land of breakthrough science -- and health care scams. There is no question that Solvadi is a lifesaver for millions of Americans infected by Hepatitis C. Yet Solvadi is also the poster child of a U.S. health care system that is being bankrupted by greed, lobbying and indefensible policies on drug pricing.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia UniversityAside from the arguments about the merits of hate-crime statutes, these crimes are notoriously difficult to prosecute because of the high burden prosecutors face when proving that the defendant\u0027s bias indeed motivated the crime.Professor of Law at Wake Forest University School of LawSo while many women are able to get the birth control that\u0027s right for them, with small or no co-pays, too many are still like Alice after her fall in Carroll\u0027s first chapter -- lying on one side, peering through a keyhole into a garden of treasures she couldn\u0027t quite get to.Pulitzer Prize-winning journalistA high-quality public education can unlock our children\u0027s potential. It can bring communities together. It can ensure a top-notch workforce for our economy and an engaged citizenry for our democracy. We have an opportunity with the ESEA reauthorization to help reclaim the promise of public education.President, American Federation of TeachersLast week, the news profession lost three of its leading lights -- Bob Simon and David Carr to sudden and unexpected death and Brian Williams to a six-month suspension. In our shock and sadness we are drawn to ask ourselves some serious questions about the state of the news media today.Author, \u0027Exit Interview\u0027; Former President, ABC NewsNow that the FBI Director and a sitting Supreme Court judge have spoken, maybe people will stop name-calling and let us deal with the gravity of the issue. Now it is our job to make this renewed attention lead to sustainable results. At the end of the day, it doesn\u0027t matter who the messenger is, as long as those that are the hardest to reach can hear it.President, National Action NetworkConsider this advice: drop the risky outsourcing; treat your employees as Southwest does; and stop ratcheting up the fees for baggage, changes of reservations, etc. Unless, that is, you believe that customer backlash, investigations by media and lawmakers and lower job gratification are not anywhere on your horizon.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorThe tragic killing of the two hostages reinforced domestic concerns over Japanese rearmament. If they want to reinforce their (recent) pacifist heritage, so be it. But they should not then expect Washington to protect them. Serious countries defend themselves. They don\u0027t turn their futures over to other nations to save a little money.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteGreece and the European Union could face a showdown in their debt talks as early as this week. And if you had to place odds right now, the likelihood is that the stubbornness of Europe\u0027s senior leaders will create a catastrophe for both Greece and the EU.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The time has come for the EU to stop running economic policy based on silly myths. If German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other leaders in the EU cannot accept reality then Greece and southern Europe would be far better off breaking free of the euro and leave Germany to wallow in its 19th century economic fairy tales.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027When members of Congress caved to demands from the insurance industry and ditched their plan to establish a \"public option\" health plan, the lawmakers also ditched one of their favorite talking points, that a government-run plan was necessary to \"keep insurers honest.\"Author, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgAs a nation, we have to grapple with events such as these in ways that collectively deepen our understanding of the intersections between race, class and gender at every level. We need to ask: How can we bring our communities together to end intolerance, hate and violence?Filmmaker and CEO of Not In Our Town, a national movement to stop hate and create safe, inclusive communities for all. NIOT.orgThe federal agency that investigates refinery catastrophes released its final report late last month on the massive fire, volatile vapor release and toxic smoke plume at Chevron\u0027s Richmond, Calif., refinery in 2012 that imperiled 19 workers and sickened 15,000 residents of surrounding communities.International President, United Steelworkersif non-Christians should be tolerant of Christian symbols and references in public spaces then why shouldn\u0027t Christian\u0027s be tolerant of public spaces being void of all religious paraphernalia. After all who does it hurt if the areas owned by everyone are free from all religious trappings?Political blogger, Detroit NewsThe fact that someone has a propensity to behave violently doesn\u0027t ipso facto mean that they would ever express this anger by using a gun. But there is no other form of personal behavior that is as dangerous and costly as pulling a trigger at yourself or someone else. Wouldn\u0027t it be much easier to just get rid of the guns?Mike the Gun GuyThe many positive character traits that Lincoln displayed have the ability to impact all of us, lead to greater entrepreneurial success and serve to inspire the next generation.President, CEO, Women’s Business Development CenterThe unprecedented backlash against Netanyahu\u0027s upcoming speech demonstrates what may be a historic moment in the history of U.S./Israeli relations. This moment is also significant in that it demonstrates the growing rift between the American Jewish community and Israel, a rift that Netanyahu has helped to accelerate.Writer and organizerThings are finally settling down in Alabama. We\u0027ll take a look at just how messy it got last week, and what happens now. Plus, Justice Ginsburg makes some pretty candid predictions for the Supreme Court\u0027s upcoming marriage decision.Marriage equality expertWe\u0027ll know Black lives matters when the dream of high quality health care for all Americans becomes a reality.Vice President of Multicultural Markets and Engagement for AARPThe symptoms of broken heart syndrome are very similar to those of a heart attack, and they can include angina (chest pain), shortness of breath, low blood pressure and temporary heart failure.Cardiologist, Author, Founder Of Revitalize-UAfter this year\u0027s retreat with a men\u0027s group, I felt each of them so deeply that I had to pull over on the highway and write this poem.Author, New York Times bestseller \u0027The Book of Awakening\u0027The only word for it is chutzpah: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u0027s call for European Jews to flee to Israel from the claws of a newly rampant anti-Semitism that is supposedly sweeping Europe.Author, \"The Watchman\u0027s File\"A great character involves us in a way that most plots can\u0027t. Even the greatest of plots with a thin character doesn\u0027t involve us, but a great character with a thin plot does. It\u0027s all about character.The best answer to any questionThe world is becoming more accessible, with airlines, accommodation and everything in between available at budget-friendly prices.
