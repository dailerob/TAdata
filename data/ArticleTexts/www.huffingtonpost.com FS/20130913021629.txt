{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027It makes us all even more cynical about politics when we see some Republicans, who we know would support military action if it were being proposed by one of their presidents, ardently opposing these strikes because Obama is calling for them. Then we see some Democrats, who always oppose military solutions, supporting this one because their president is in charge. Disgusting. There are massive numbers of human lives involved here, plus a real danger of war engulfing the region and spreading out with weapons of mass destruction present -- yet all we can talk about is politics? So let\u0027s have some honest talk for a change.Comments (64)Albert BrooksActor, Writer, Filmmaker, Comedian, Author, 2030: The Real Story of What Happens To AmericaMr. Putin, it\u0027s one thing to put down exceptionalism, but before you do that, you at least have to produce one Broadway show, or make one commercial airliner, or invent one type of salad.Comments (930)Martin J. DurbinPresident and CEO, America’s Natural Gas AllianceAs a nation we\u0027re concerned with protecting our environment, while also keeping our economy strong and enjoying the comforts of modern living. We don\u0027t spend a lot of time thinking about the energy that makes all of this possible. Why get into the nitty-gritty details of power generation and all that it takes to make the simple act of flipping a switch deliver the light and power that we rely upon?Comments (9)Kirk DouglasActorThere can never be forgiveness if we do not first admit our mistakes. Racism is a sin for which we have never atoned. It is a grave injustice that must be addressed before we can ever truly move forward as a nation. Apologies are not excuses, but they are a good start on the road to repentance.Comments (105)Rachel Macy StaffordCertified special education teacher and authorVery rarely does one sentence have immediate impact on me. Very rarely does one sentence change the way I interact with my family. But this one did.Comments (82)Josh SilverDirector, Represent.UsAs soon as Foreign Relations Committee members take money from the very companies that stand to make millions from military action, we the people can no longer be unequivocally sure that they are making decisions purely on the merits of what\u0027s best for our nation.Comments (73)Anna NeistatAssociate Director, Program/Emergencies, Human Rights WatchIt\u0027s not what Vladimir Putin\u0027s New York Times op-ed says that\u0027s so worrisome; it\u0027s what it doesn\u0027t say. As a Russian and as someone who has been to Syria multiple times since the beginning of the conflict to investigate war crimes and other violations, I would like to mention a few things Putin overlooked.Comments (524)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorYou want to know what\u0027s actually well-established in American fiscal policy? It\u0027s a budget process where both sides lay out their visions in terms of future receipts and outlays, hammer out a compromise in conference, and pass a budget.Comments (110)Jon SoltzCo-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranMilitary members, above all, know that use of force -- short of an imminent danger -- is a last resort. And we\u0027re not at that point yet.Comments (27)Adam GrantWharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027We\u0027re often shocked by what people post online. What shapes why some people seem to have no filter in social media, whereas others are more selective and private -- and what should your strategy be?Comments (76)Ann BrenoffSenior Writer, The Huffington PostI do not want to install solar panels on my roof or refinish my kitchen cabinets. I also do not want to paint my house, redo my floors, install a pool or resurface the one I don\u0027t have. My garage doors don\u0027t need to be replaced, my windows don\u0027t need to be washed, and I\u0027m not planning on extending my car warranty or refinancing my mortgage any time soon. So can you all please stop calling me?Comments (110)Elisha Goldstein, Ph.D.Psychologist; Author, \u0027The Now Effect\u0027; Co-author, \u0027A Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Workbook\u0027Use these as a north star to help guide your actions in the days that follow toward an even more fulfilling life. Although we can veer off the path, when we notice the star, we can always come back to it.Comments (69)Leah LambSo there I was, walking through the desert, tears streaming down my face, wondering why the hell I had spent so much time and energy to get here. This is not what I came for, I was thinking to myself as I watched yet another tutu-clad raver bop on by.Comments (100)Sen. Bernie SandersIndependent U.S. Senator from VermontWith a loud and clear voice, the overwhelming majority of the American people, across the political spectrum, are saying NO to another war in the Middle East -- Syria\u0027s bloody and complicated civil war.Comments (53)Russell SimmonsFounder, GlobalGrind.comFor anyone to call Obama \"weak\" or a \"wimp\" because he is more confident in his words than the war machine, I would ask you to remember the mistake of Iraq. I applaud the president for his restraint.Comments (119)Brian Levin, J.D.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State University\"Only the credible use of force\" set in motion the diplomatic efforts we are now seeing. And despite his protestations to the contrary, it brought Putin\u0027s posterior and that of its murderous ally to the bargaining table.CommentsTerrell ThomasCornerback, New York GiantsI want to bring to you the story of an athlete, one who has endured a great amount of adversity both during and after football season. I am Terrell Thomas, and I hope that this blog gives you great insight into my life and career.CommentsTrevor MartinWriter and actorIn adulthood we discover that other gay men had adopted these women in exactly the same way in childhood. Why do we, as individuals, gravitate to women, even the same women, before we are part of a gay scene, and before we are swept up in any collective gay groupthink?Comments (23)David L. PhillipsDirector, Program on Peace-building and Rights, Columbia University Institute for the Study of Human RightsMilitary action in Syria could embroil the United States in civil wars from the Tigris to the Levant; U.S interests could also come under direct attack. A steely-eyed view of regional dynamics and contingency planning are critical to optimizing U.S. objectives.Comments (32)Holly BrockwellWriterHow many times do we have to say \"don\u0027t slap your brand all over tragedies\"? How many times do we have to ask who approved using mass grief to sell products? How many more times?CommentsDoug RiversMost of the reporting on the Syrian crisis, aside from occasional man-on-the-street interviews in Damascus, has come from outside Syria. The internet and mobile technology allow the voices of ordinary Syrians to be part of this debate.CommentsDavid WildTV Writer; Contributing Editor, Rolling Stone; Co-Author, \u0027Everybody\u0027s Brother\u0027There are artists who go in and out of style. Then there are artists who define their own style. Stevie Nicks is one of those unique and singular sensations who come from the heart and somehow reside there forever.Comments (19)Chris BarnesWriterWatching Freaks and Geeks brings back memories of our teenage years, but there are several life lessons that you can take away from the show that pertain to everyday life. Here are some of our favorite household tips from the series.Comments (12)Fariha Naqvi-MohamedFounder, CanadianMomEhIf Quebec\u0027s charter of values is to guard us against others, then please explain what exactly happens to the thousands like me? The ones who were born and raised in this beautiful province, the eaters of poutine and joueurs d\u0027hockey, who yes, by the way, also drape a piece of cloth over their heads or wear a turban, or a kippah, or a star around their necks.Comments (340)Don TapscottAdvisor to government and business leaders; Author, \u0027Macrowikinomics\u0027If we listen to the theories of Ronald Coase from over 60 years ago we can understand how the digital revolution helps us find the uniquely qualified minds and talent to create wealth, govern and educate ourselves for the future.CommentsDiane RavitchHistorian, NYU professorYesterday, the New York Times published an article about my forthcoming book that turned out to be a profile of me. The headline was wrong, however, and I know that reporters don\u0027t write headlines. Whoever wrote it is out of touch.CommentsChris WeigantPolitical writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comJohn Boehner tried a diplomatic solution, to allow Tea Partiers to vote for the umpteenth time against Obamacare while still allowing some sort of budget to pass so the government doesn\u0027t shut its doors in October. This compromise was just rejected by the Tea Partiers.Comments (149)Jeffrey SachsDirector, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \"To Move the World: JFK\u0027s Quest for Peace\"The most important lesson that we learn from John Kennedy is to fashion the future out of our rational hopes, not our fears. He was the first to deny the baseless hopes of idle dreamers. But he was also for seeing things as they might be, and asking, \"Why not?\"CommentsJane HortonPolitical/military consultant, veterans and military family advocateToo many of you will have to spend the rest of your life trying to wade your way through a normalcy that will always be anything but normal to a soldier who has experienced war. My heart is for you. All of you.CommentsElad NehoraiPop ChassidNow that I\u0027ve tried to change the way I look at love, the more I become shocked at the messages of love I had gotten when I was younger.Comments (294)Peter Van BurenAuthor, \u0027We Meant Well\u0027 and the upcoming \u0027Ghosts of Tom Joad, A Story of the #99Percent\u0027At this moment, Congress has the opportunity to choose a new meaning for future anniversaries of 9/11. It could be the day that life went on just as disastrously as previously -- or it could be the day that changed everything, and this time for the better.CommentsDaniel WagnerCEO, Country Risk SolutionsThere is good reason to believe that Mr. Assad is serious, and that he will do his part to make the decommissioning of Syria\u0027s chemical weapons arsenal a reality. But a number of things stand in the way of making this proposal meaningful.Comments (175)Amy Siskind, 2013.12.09William Bradley, 2013.12.09Bettina Korek, 2013.12.09Robert Naiman, 2013.12.09Jim Moore, 2013.12.09Jennifer Delaney, 2013.12.09Foodbeast, 2013.12.09Mark Rubinstein, 2013.12.09Brad Friedman and Desi Doyen, 2013.12.09Francisco J.
