{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyAfter three decades of engineering a winner-take-all economy, and buying the political power to consummate their hold on the wealth created by the system they had rigged in their favor, America\u0027s plutocrats have been taking the final and irrevocable step of separating themselves permanently from the common course of American life. They would occupy a gated stratosphere far above the madding crowd while their political hirelings below look after their earthly interests. The $1.15 trillion spending bill passed by Congress last Friday and quickly signed by President Obama is just the latest triumph in the plutocratic management of politics that has accelerated since 9/11.Dear Hillary: Your post also troubles me. You cannot intersperse a few words in Spanish and a couple references to what your staff assumes to be a Latinx culture, and then call yourself our abuela.Masters Candidate in Religion, Yale UniversityAssuming all of Trump\u0027s bluster isn\u0027t just for political show, one could just as easily see in his rantings an embarrassing childishness.Director of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel HillAs economic inequality reaches new heights and austerity programs are debated around the world (most recently, in Spain and Portugal), learn how a lie becomes a political and economic \"truth.\"Author and cultural theoristThe successful minority students I know chose these elite universities because of the challenging and demanding curriculum they knew they could handle. So, no Justice Scalia, we weren\u0027t meeting some quota. We belonged there.Reporter, Georgia girl, Northwestern Wildcat, sorority sister, fitness enthusiast, and foodieIn Spain\u0027s elections last Sunday, the two parties that have ruled the country for the past three decades took serious losses. This has important implications for the future of not only the country but also the rest of Europe.Co-director, Center for Economic and Policy Research, Washington, D.C.A number of folks have asked me about an article claiming that recent minimum wage increases may have \"killed as many as 200,000 jobs.\" In fact, based on a balanced look at the underlying data, the article could also just as easily have argued that these increases did not kill 200,000 jobs. Let me explain.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorIt\u0027s not just that God came, but how God came. It wasn\u0027t accidental that the savior of the world was born to a poor peasant woman in an occupied country in an animal stall because they were literally homeless at the time of his birth. And soon Jesus and his family were made refugees and had to flee their country because the most powerful political ruler around the Christ child felt very threatened by his coming.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersThe pharmaceutical industry\u0027s rationale that it needs high prices to afford the research has been turned on its head by Valeant\u0027s business model of spending less than 3 percent on research \u0026 development (R\u0026D) and paying less than 3 percent in taxes.Senior Fellow, Harvard Business SchoolIn 2015, state legislators considered bills to legalize marijuana in 21 states, decriminalize marijuana possession in 17 states, and legalize medical marijuana in 19 states.

But this week, I lost my mother.President, Export-Import Bank of the United StatesLike one of those towns in Wales that has a name with no vowels and 43 letters, we had to find out a little more about Agrabah. Well, Agrabah only exists in the minds of Disney writers and animators.Political satiristsIf we decide that 2C is still too much warming, and seek a lower target of 1.5C, the challenge is more uphill. Reducing emissions alone won\u0027t be adequate, and sequestration of atmospheric carbon will be critical. We can do this. No, we must do this.Director of Penn State Earth System Science Center; Author of \u0027Dire Predictions\u0027 and \u0027The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars\u0027This year showed profound changes in the laws that impact those with caregiving responsibilities -- from legal judgements to changing social attitudes. It was a notable year for working parents.Founder, The Spiggle Law FirmSometimes the biggest obstacles are the ones we create and tell ourselves about the world around us. It\u0027s easy for delusions and lies to take root and grow, and left unchecked, they can do serious harm. Do any of these sound familiar?Leadership Global Consultant and CoachBlack people don\u0027t necessarily need to see a leading Black contender in 2016. They need true connection beyond the Nae-Nae dance and random visits to our barbershops. They need real proposals that connect to their every day, inequitable, Black, concerns.Strategist. Problem Solver. Civicologist. Cautious Optimist.Obama recognizes that some Americans hate him for his race, and that racial prejudice is even implicated in the xenophobia and Islamophobia directed at him. All of these attacks illustrate the burden of being the president while black.author of America Is Not Post-Racial: Xenophobia, Islamophobia, Racism, and the 44th PresidentTo the empty stocking and unlit tree, this year you may look alone up there. But, you are not truly alone for you are filled with my memories of Christmas past and you will hold the memories of our Christmas future.Just trying to complete this journey, but I keep losing my car keys and shoesAll year long I tell my son that lying is bad. Not just bad but the worst. And then every December my wife and I lie to him all month long. We do it for him, to preserve his fleeting belief in magic for as long as we can.Senior Editor, Huffington Post CanadaAmerica\u0027s greatest strengths comes from any individual\u0027s ability to be an American while also keeping one\u0027s cultural and religious identity. We do not need to be amalgamated. Being American means recognizing that our individual value is celebrated as it is added to America\u0027s shared values.Senior business professional, academic, former US Naval Officer, and former White House Fellow.Even the ideas you consider worthy and apolitical have to struggle to rise above the noise level. I hope that many who read these lines and think about the many Syrian children who will spend this season in schools that are bombed, scavenging for food, will not only sign the petition but also ask others to join us in advancing a good cause.Professor of international relations, George Washington UniversityThe anxiety of the looming holidays can be downright debilitating.

Chicago is my heartbeat.Whereas Affluenza is categorized by a naive wealth-laden mindset that creates a narrow vision of how the world works and the consequences that one must bear for their actions, Lowcashism is the same disease but from a different set of causes.Harvard chaplain, Educator and AuthorNow millions of Black girls AND women will see this story in a whole new way and more importantly, they will see themselves in the smartest, kindest, most useful character in the entire Harry Potter series. Eventually, Black girls will start to see themselves as limitless. What could possibly be wrong with that?Blog Editor, The Huffington PostThere are many social norms that dictate gift-giving, including when, how and what to give as gifts. Interestingly, these norms don\u0027t seem to be about making sure that recipients get the gifts they want. What makes for a good or bad gift often differs in the eyes of givers and recipients.Independent source of news and analysis, from the academic and research community.I\u0027m wearing my husband\u0027s deodorant today, hoping for an infusion of masculine energy so I can convincingly take up two seats on the bus this morning. Twenty minutes into my experiment, I head out the door, my smile already about 30 percent more rakish.WriterReports of the death of print books were, it turns out, premature. Print book sales in the United States in 2015 are up more than 2 percent over last year, according to Nielsen BookScan.Journal of Books and IdeasFor me, The Hateful Eight was a mixed bag. The performances are first-rate, though the music was overly heavy at times and it occasionally worked against what was happening by overpowering it to make it appear that more was happening than actually was.Screenwriter; former member, WGAW Board of Directors; former U.S. Senate aideFor years, the Transportation Department relied on big fines to deter violations of federal law by airlines.
