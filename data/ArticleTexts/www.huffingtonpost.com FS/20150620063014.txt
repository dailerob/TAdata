We must re-commit and renew ourselves to 24/7 voter registration and to efforts to get national background checks on the purchase or transfer of guns by or from one person to another. And as difficult I as it is, those of us who are African American have no other choice than to extend the hand of love and reconciliation to our white brothers and sisters, no matter how many times they may commit acts of violence against us. Yes, we must invoke all resources of state and federal law enforcement to protect our homes, our children, our persons and our churches from racist acts of violence. This must be done, however, in the spirit of reconciliation, not vengeance.Positive and constructive approaches offer a way to strengthen journalism, at a time when more than ever, we need a way of looking at the world that sparks the potential in us all.Editor-in-chief of Positive News, co-founder of the Constructive Journalism ProjectIn the wake of the horrendous racist terrorist attack on Charleston\u0027s historic Emanuel AME church that left nine innocent African-American churchgoers and leaders dead, many questions have arisen about hate crimes and extremism in the United States. Here are some answers.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityThe Global Moms Relay is one of my favorite HuffPost traditions, a collaborative effort to tap into our collective gratitude and love, not only for our own mothers, but for all mothers around the world.

Beginning in the 18th century, there is documented evidence of white citizens targeting black religious gatherings with both legal sanctions and terroristic methods.Plummer Professor of Christian Morals and Pusey Minister in the Memorial Church of Harvard UniversityDad would be so proud to see how we\u0027ve come together, and grown, since his passing. I imagine him sitting back, with a big smile on his face, marveling at how we\u0027ve healed and how we\u0027ve taken his biggest dream -- prizing family above all else -- and made it a reality.Editorial Director, Lifestyle; The Huffington PostThe Confederacy was the most vile and harmful political invention in United States history. It was founded on the explicit principle that slavery is the \"natural and normal condition\" of black people, and that they should be ruthlessly exploited to the benefit of their white masters. Where in that story arc is anything worth celebrating?Senior Editor for Projects \u0026 Investigations, The Huffington PostIn a crime that has outraged locals, a sniper has reportedly shot down the beloved Confederate flag that traditionally graces the Statehouse in Columbia, South Carolina. \"This was clearly one very disturbed individual,\" said Council Chairman Harvey \"Harve\" Jeffcoat. \"And I can tell you with certainty that he does not represent our community.\"Novelist, Amnesia, Milrose Munce, GalunkerAs U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan put it, \"I am increasingly worried that our teachers, our administrators don\u0027t reflect the great diversity of our nation\u0027s students, and that is a real problem.\"President, Children\u0027s Defense FundIt\u0027s hard to believe that it\u0027s been 24 years since I picked out a Father\u0027s Day card. I always enjoyed that ritual of choosing just the right one--funny or loving--that I knew my dad would enjoy.Award-winning actress, author and activistImprisoning a staggering number of our people is wrong. The way our nation does it is even worse. We must end mass incarceration, now.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Racism is not a mental illness. Unlike actual mental illnesses, it is taught and instilled. Mental illness was not the state policy of South Carolina, or any state for that matter, for hundreds of years -- racism was.Staff Reporter, The Huffington PostAthens has a unique aura of the past mixed into the present. So here is my list of my favorite places, some lesser known than others but nevertheless worthy of exploration.Student at New York UniversityYou could wonder if her loyalists had been unaware of another possible reading of the metaphor presented by the sight of Roosevelt Island against the skyline of Wall Street -- something her handlers didn\u0027t intend: A mockery of the words she was speaking at that very minute.Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanySenior writer, Moyers \u0026 Company on public TV. Senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.As soon as I heard about the mass killing of nine worshipers at Charleston\u0027s Emanuel AME Church, my heart broke -- again. Yet another gunman, yet another place that should be safe from violence, even more families shattered. No more Charlestons. No more Newtowns, Auroras or Isla Vistas. Not one more.Founder, Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in AmericaPro-gun mouthpieces couldn\u0027t even wait 24 hours after the unspeakable event to begin peddling a shabby version of \"they got what they probably deserved.\" But the simple fact of the matter is that mass shootings aren\u0027t supposed to happen in churches or schools. These places are sanctuaries in every sense of the word.Mike the Gun GuyAs the Charleston community comes together in mourning, it is important to also come together to reflect on how such a tragedy could happen in the first place, and what must be done at a larger, societal level to prevent this from happening again.Tracy Fehr Sardone is a human rights practitioner and independent journalist. She currently resides in Charleston, SC.Unarmed black men and women are shot in the street almost weekly for nonviolent crimes and the mainstream nation tells us they had it coming.

Its roots lie in one of the first black religious and mutual help societies, the Free African Society founded by Philadelphia blacks in 1787.Manisha Sinha is Professor of Afro-American Studies and History at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.Every kid growing up in a South Asian household knows there is a certain four-letter word you shan\u0027t utter. No, it\u0027s not the f-word, and no it doesn\u0027t rhyme with hit. It\u0027s the l-word: love.Associate Editor, Huff/Post 50If ISIS had killed 547 Americans in 2013, we\u0027d have sent tens of thousands of Americans back to Iraq, so why do we simply shrug our shoulders at hundreds of murders that aren\u0027t linked to a terrorist group?Columnist and author published in The Hill, The Baltimore Sun, The Jerusalem Post, Salon, and other publicationsBlack Churches have been under attack for hundreds of years, dating back to slavery. Be it bombings during the civil rights movement, or Black Churches being set on fire, the Black Church has been under perpetual attack since its inception.Author, Speaker, Coach, ConsultantTo all of you who have lost a father whom you have loved dearly and who showed you that love right back, I hope you can embrace Father\u0027s Day with a spirit of gratitude and courage.

We should learn from the past.Founding Co-director, Social Security WorksStunningly, and probably predictably, some right-wing politicians and pundits not only don\u0027t seem to get it, but are attempting to distract and confuse others about what was the obvious, real motivation of this massacre. Seriously?Director of African American Religious Affairs, People For the American Way and People For the American Way FoundationDespite the revelations provided by Edward Snowden about the scope and illegality of the U.S. government\u0027s mass surveillance programs, the Intelligence Community\u0027s power to fight back remains potent -- especially when its ostensible watchdogs are its biggest supporters and apologists.Policy Analyst for Homeland Security and Civil Liberties, Cato InstituteIn April 2015, the New York Times wrote that there are 1.5 million men missing in the Black community because of mass incarceration.
