{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"The response to Hurricane Irene showed that when the media devote wall-to-wall attention to something, and government officials bring a sense of urgency and ask the public to respond in kind, remarkable things can happen. The question is: why do we reserve this kind of collective action for natural disasters and external attacks? The fact is, we have another crisis that\u0027s been hovering over the entire United States for almost three years now and shows no signs of blowing over. The numbers -- including over 25 million unemployed or underemployed Americans -- should be just as scary as the ones that have dominated our national conversation about Irene. With the toll that the job crisis is taking on the lives of millions of people in this country -- from college graduates who can\u0027t get jobs to middle class families being thrown out of their homes -- this is a category 5 disaster.Read Post | Comments (741)Doug Kendall, 8/30/11Founder and President, Constitutional Accountability CenterIn spite of the clear evidence to the contrary, many tea partiers continue to argue that the Constitution preserves state sovereignty, appealing in some cases to a mistaken view of history.Read Post | Comments (13)Robert L.
