Is everyone a blogger except me?Read Post | CommentsBIOJames Pinkerton, 05.29.2007When politicians lose themselves in the pyrotechnics of their own romantic ecstasies, even artists will feel compelled to step in and provide the needed dousing.Read Post | Comments (23)BIOMarty Kaplan, 05.31.2007Q: Now that it\u0027s an established fact that Plame was a covert CIA agent, won\u0027t all the media people who insisted she wasn\u0027t covert have to correct their misstatements?
