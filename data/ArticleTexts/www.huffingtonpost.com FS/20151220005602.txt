{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Director, Represent.UsCommunications Director, Represent.UsCongress has officially approved the latest omnibus budget deal, which now heads to President Obama\u0027s desk. The bill is essentially guaranteed to be signed into law, because anything less means the government would shut down. Again. In what\u0027s become something of a sick annual tradition, members of Congress attached a multitude of riders to this must-pass piece of legislation in an attempt to sneak through deeply unpopular things they could never justify introducing or voting for on their own. The text of the 2,000 page bill was quietly made available to the public in the middle of the night on Tuesday -- just a few days before it was passed by both houses of Congress. So, what was Congress trying to hide?To be clear, fear of Muslims is not just a function of what this or that candidate says, because what the candidates are saying is a reflection of what the significant parts of the constituent base each party believes.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027It is to be hoped that in the long-term, Bernie\u0027s \"political revolution\" will give rise to a more inclusive and internationalist spirit, thus challenging the limited confines and debates which have so recently clouded meaningful discourse.Author, \u0027Revolution! South America and the Rise of the New Left\u0027Three years after the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Newtown, Connecticut where a lone 20-year-old gunman wielding an assault weapon snuffed out 26 child and teacher lives, our nation has done shamefully little to protect children instead of guns.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundAs we do every year, we are pre-empting our regular \"Friday Talking Points\" column, in order to bring you our \"best and worst of 2015\" list.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comEvery holiday dinner needs a show-stopping sweet finish.

Rather, she\u0027s acting as a shill for Hillary Clinton, doing everything in her power to ensure that no one will effectively challenge Hillary\u0027s coronation as the nominee.Entertainment attorney, writer and political activistDon\u0027t be fooled by the possibility of success following the climate summit in Paris in December.

Blogger at The Color Coded Life.The networks have grasped Donald Trump to their collective bosom like the winner of one of those misogynistic, televised beauty pageants he owns. Each pronouncement from the Sultan of Slur is treated as epic, no matter how deeply insulting, bigoted or just plain ridiculous.Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanySenior writer, BillMoyers.com. Former senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.If we expect education to be the great equalizer, then it\u0027s not good enough to start at the college level, or the elementary and secondary levels, or even at the kindergarten level. We need to start in children\u0027s earliest years.U.S. Senator from New HampshireThis year over 400 artists responded to my call for work, making the process of choosing ten works especially challenging and exciting.Professor of Art and Art History, Mt. San Jacinto College\"I Saw Mom Kissing Santa\" will be playing in hell when I get there.Author of OUR BODIES, OUR SHELVES: LIBRARY HUMORIt may not happen for another four years, but one of these lunatics could eventually win the presidency. If that happens, you can expect a massive paradigm shift in the American political culture, driving an already right-wing country further to the right, even into outright fascism.Writer and historianThere is an old saying for people who are stuck in an unhealthy situation: If you want to get out of a hole, stop digging. There is a corollary for a world addicted to fossil fuels: If you want to cure the addiction, stop subsidizing the drug.Executive Director, Presidential Climate Action ProjectWhen I say I\u0027m an educated, independent and ambitious Muslim-American woman, I mean it. As a child of war, I learned at a very young age what it means to be a female in this world. After 9/11, I also learned what it means to be a Muslim-American in this world.Financial Decision Support Analyst, Muslim AmericanWhen the movies by and about women do come out, in equal numbers and with equal budgets, hopefully the men who review them will have evolved enough to see a woman-child doing crass, gross-out comedy with her female co-star and find it funny.Author, \u0027Happiness as a Second Language\u0027A new study released last week by the Virginia-based nonprofit Treatment Advocacy Center reported that people with untreated mental illness are 16 times more likely to be killed by police than people without. In fact, people with severe mental illness account for one in four of all fatal police encounters.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarSinatra: The Chairman is coming out in the 100th anniversary year of Sinatra\u0027s birth, and it does as good a job as any book has of showing why Sinatra is truly an artist and a man for the ages.Journal of Books and IdeasThe world chess champion Magnus Carlsen won the Chess Grand Tour, a three tournaments bonanza played in Norway, the USA and England, and involving the world\u0027s best players.International Chess GrandmasterPresident Obama signed today represents months of negotiations by the House and Senate. And while some of the loudest and largest passengers on that omnibus include defense spending, tax reform, and homeland security, a number of critical animal causes fortunately found seats as well.ASPCA President and CEOEvery Student Succeeds Act represents a substantive shift: It returns a fair amount of control over education policy to the states. This has led to celebration in some quarters and worry in others. I believe both reactions are misconceived -- or at least overstated.Education expertWe pilgrimaged to a lonely spot on the outskirts of the city and another site in the town of Wetumpka.

Whiskey drinker. Mom.Let\u0027s downgrade them from \"joined at the hip\" to \"pretty good friends.\" This will enable us to pursue a more aggressive policy against ISIS, because the main constraint against doing so in the past has been our closeness to Saudi Arabia and Turkey, which have opposed an aggressive policy against ISIS.Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicyLee\u0027s new film, Chi-Raq, might not be \"likable\" but it definitely follows his previous films as it prompts viewers to think critically about unresolved tensions and problems in the film and the broader social world.Professor, Writer, Teacher, Freestyle artistProgressives need to build the infrastructure and the foundation at the state level to lay the groundwork for policy wins -- now is the time to dig deeper into the states. We must make progress now and over the long-term to help families make ends meet.Former Secretary of Health and Human ServicesMy concern is not whether Trump really is a Christian, though I admit I have serious doubts.
