Every second of this campaign not spent talking about the Republican Party\u0027s record, and John McCain\u0027s role in that record, is a victory for John McCain. Her critics like to say that Palin hasn\u0027t accomplished anything. I disagree: in the space of ten days she\u0027s succeeded in distracting the country from the horrific Bush record -- and McCain\u0027s complicity in it. My friends, that\u0027s accomplishment we can believe in.Read Post | CommentsBIORobert Creamer, 09.09.2008Take personal responsibility to do the two things that will win -- persuade swing voters, and mobilize people who won\u0027t vote unless they are motivated to do so.Read Post | Comments (31)BIODrew Westen, 09.09.2008Just hours after the Democratic Convention, the Obama campaign had forgotten everything it should have learned from its success of Denver--and had returned to the same failed strategies that gave us Presidents Dukakis, Gore, and Kerry.Read Post | Comments (270)BIOBrandon Friedman, 09.09.2008All of a sudden, the commander of the Alaska National Guard became one of Palin\u0027s biggest supporters.
