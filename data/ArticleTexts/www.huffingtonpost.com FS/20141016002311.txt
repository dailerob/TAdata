{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Public Health Editor, The Huffington Post; Former U.S. Assistant Surgeon GeneralThe first person treated for Ebola in the United States died last week. He had travelled to America from Liberia after helping an infected individual in his country. Now, alarmingly, two health care workers who cared for this patient in a Texas hospital intensive care unit are the first people to be infected with the virus in America. Tragically, despite extensive emergency preparedness planning and reports issued in the aftermath of 9/11, the anthrax attacks, SARS, and H1N1 flu, the world is still unprepared to fight Ebola. It now appears that these reports never translated into the global actions needed for a surge response anywhere in the world when a new infectious disease killer emerges.Let me be as honest as I can be: If white Christians in America were more Christian than white, black parents could feel safer about their children. It\u0027s time for us white Christians to repent -- turn around and go in a new direction.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersWe should stop obsessing about test scores and start obsessing about the health and well-being of children and their families. The gains would be far more valuable than a few points on a standardized test.Research Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027As a Colorado citizen who pays more than ordinary attention to American politics generally and to Colorado politics particularly, I am dumbfounded and appalled by The Denver Post\u0027s endorsement of Congressman Cory Gardner.United States Senator (Ret.)While theoretically all hospitals should be able to manage an Ebola patient, in practice it is not possible. In my opinion, we cannot train hundreds of hospital staff including doctors, nurses, phlebotomists, and X-ray technician in meticulous isolation procedures.Physician and WriterLiterary types, take note: If you\u0027re thinking of acquiring a dog, consider the dachshund. No dog has been more widely loved by writers worldwide.Author of \u0027The Great Grisby: Two Thousand Years of Literary, Royal, Philosophical, and Artistic Dog Lovers and Their Exceptional Animals\u0027The greater we supported the corrupt government in Kabul and the more American troops we sent, the more the Taliban prospered. A similar dynamic is at play in Iraq. Consequently, without a change in American policy the cycle of violence in Iraq will continue its ghastly spiral.Senior Fellow, Center for International Policy; Board of Directors, Council for a Livable World; MatthewHoh.comIn the natural evolution of markets, as markets become more efficient, they turn from being use-driven to expectations-driven -- like equities, real estate, or derivatives based on both. For this reason, the unintended consequence of efficiency is price volatility.Author, \u0027Fixing the Game\u0027We shouldn\u0027t require a horrific epidemic like Ebola to remind us why we observe Global Handwashing Day today. But it seems, alas, many in the world can use a reminder about the importance of good hygiene.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia UniversityDirector, Earth Institute at Columbia UniversityThe sad reality is that most gun deaths result from the 300 million guns primarily owned by decent, law-abiding people who assume they are bringing guns into their homes for self protection, and not anticipating a tragic accident.Head of the early stage technology fund, Baroda Ventures; Chair of the David Bohnett FoundationAs a clinical psychiatrist and researcher, my goal is to uncover new treatments for people like John, who have tried standard treatments, but who continue to have severe symptoms. John has tried all of the research studies offered in our research clinic, and those offered in other academic settings in New York City. Now he is my office and at the end of his rope. Could he be a candidate for a surgical procedure called deep brain stimulation, also called DBS?Florence Irving Assistant Professor at Columbia UniversityThe reality facing both sides will not change: There are spoilers in the U.S. and Iran who will try to torpedo a deal, no matter the details. Precisely because it is impossible to satisfy ideologues, they only way to defeat them is to have a deal in hand that both sides believe is a win-win outcome.Research Director, National Iranian American CouncilIf you want to know what the future would look like under an all-GOP Congress, you need only look at what Republicans have said and done in the past. They will take a meat ax to our nation\u0027s top domestic priorities, including the very public health systems that we rely upon to keep us safe. We cannot let that happen.U.S. Senator from CaliforniaSomehow threatening to kill, rape or maim someone is different on a public forum than it would be in person and this particular case is important enough to go all the way to country\u0027s highest court for consideration.Richard Zombeck is a freelance writer for hire living in the Boston area and hangs out at www.zombeckink.comBut with the rise of ISIL and the American commitment to destroying it in mind, providing opportunities for university study to Syria\u0027s qualified young men is no longer just about higher education, its also about security and preventing the radicalization of a generation.Associate Professor and Director, UC Davis Human Rights InitiativeParents of white children should not wait to talk about race until their children bring it up.Professor of Early Childhood Education at The University of Texas at AustinMy new venture in consumer tech and wearables gives me a way to demonstrate and justify why kids should take an interest in STEM education, to walk the walk vs. just talk.Musician, technology advocate, and founder of i.am+\"When you see G-D, honey, can you please talk to Him about the Royals? Your daddy really wants to see them win this year.\" I managed a half-grin, and chimed in: \"How about a deep playoff run?\" Winning the World Series was probably too much to ask.Father, husband, dreamer and Kansas City Royals fanThe challenge of mobilizing aggressively on the current scale is a daunting one, even without second-guessing from people with no experience in fighting disease. Wasting resources by following casual advice -- even if adamantly spoken and mightily propelled -- would make the tragedy of this disease even greater.Dean and DeLamar Professor of Public Health, Columbia University Mailman School of Public HealthWestern governments, those with the power to do something about Palestinian children\u0027s sorrowful predicament, too often only address Israeli fears while downplaying the horrifying realities faced by Palestinian children.Founding member, lyricist, and principal composer of Pink FloydNearly 3 billion gallons (or the equivalent of 454 Olympic swimming pools) of oil industry wastewater were illegally dumped into central California\u0027s aquifer supplying drinking water and irrigation to farmers.Broadcaster, Conservation BiologistMisplaced priorities and a profit motive are starving the schools, in the midst of the state\u0027s impressive prison expansion.Writer, Human Rights and Social Justice AdvocateWe need to change the face of the U.S. Senate. It\u0027s the only way to finally start getting things done in Washington. And in 2016, when we elect a feminist woman as president, she\u0027ll have the allies she\u0027ll need to enact her agenda.President, National Organization for WomenThe founding idea of modern economics is Adam Smith\u0027s invisible hand, and this great idea, badly over-simplified, was the foundation of many bad ideas of the last generation.Author, \u0027Seven Bad Ideas: How Mainstream Economists Have Damaged America and the World\u0027Forget about feeling \"like a room without a roof,\" or whatever that \"Happy\" song says. If you want to know \"what happiness is to you,\" try living in a social democracy.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourEver since I read Villa Triste in my late teens, I have been captivated by Patrick Modiano\u0027s forays into the shadowy atmosphere of ravaged memories that make up his novels. I am far from alone, since Modiano is somewhat of a cult figure in France, read by thousands.Art Historian; Museum Berggruen BerlinThinking about whether a particular set of religious practices or beliefs would make sense on a different planet might be a valuable exercise in understanding ourselves.Professor of Astronomy, Vanderbilt UniversityThat\u0027s the importance of community care and what we\u0027re doing on the ground in Liberia.
