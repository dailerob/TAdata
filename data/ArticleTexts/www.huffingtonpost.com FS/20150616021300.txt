{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Global Editorial DirectorAs of Monday, being a Bush has been as much (if not more) of a burden than it has been a blessing for Jeb. His family contacts have allowed to him to build a war chest of perhaps $100 million. He has built-in contacts in key states and has no trouble getting attention. But he has been hampered by questions about his older brother’s controversial record. Almost everyone else in America, including his hawkish rivals for the Republican presidential nomination, have now branded the Iraq War an ignorant, colossal mistake. And yet Jeb seemed surprised when asked about it. After days of dodging hesitation, he finally joined with rest. And he has the burden of inheriting, by inference, his father and brother’s reputations as relative ideological moderates, especially by today’s hard-right Tea Party GOP.In remembering John Carroll, what is less talked about are the journalistic characteristics and personal beliefs that formed the basis of his philosophy. Call them Carroll\u0027s rules of the road -- rules that are challenged mightily by an Internet-driven society that provides every voice, no matter how dissonant or anonymous, with a megaphone.Media consultant, former managing editor of the Los Angeles TimesFmr. Managing Editor of the Los Angeles Times and Fmr. Executive Features Editor of the Huffington PostI\u0027m a black adoptee who grew up in a rural, predominantly white town, with a white family. And what strikes me as the most perverse and pathological aspect of this story is Dolezal\u0027s relationship to -- and ultimate identity theft of -- her black adoptive siblings.Director of Digital Media and Marketing at Scenarios USAA victory by the masses, or \"everyday people,\" over big money and big media is always grounds for celebration. But it is important to remember the game is far from over. This is one of those bills, like the TARP, where we are playing by rich people\u0027s rules.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Back in March, when Indiana Gov. Mike Pence and the state\u0027s Republican-controlled legislature retreated under pressure on a Religious Restoration Freedom Act, many heralded the \"moment\" as a \"turning point\" in the battle for full LGBT rights. But last week both North Carolina and Michigan passed discriminatory laws far worse than Indiana\u0027s ever was.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostWhile Obama appealed to party loyalty, many Democrats, who have watched factory after factory leave the United States with no replacements in sight, seized the moral high ground. They took a stand against the secret trade-negotiating process that puts all the power in the hands of powerful industry lobbyists, shutting out U.S. workers and their representatives in Congress.The Center for Media and Democracy/ALEC ExposedLast week’s events should ring down the curtain on the era of “trade” deals like NAFTA and TPP. It’s fine for Republicans and their corporate allies to promote this stuff. We expect it of them. But the 99 percent deserve a party of our own. If a Democratic White House doesn’t get that, this steamrolling is well-deserved.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Bush\u0027s misplaced reputation for moderation is belied by his actual policy record. And few if any analysts have stopped to consider how Bush\u0027s specific policy issues line up with Latino support for key policy issues.Leader in Latino political opinion researchNo illness should be a source of shame, but there are some illnesses where the shame is unspoken, silenced or medicated. Behind every addiction is someone in pain, someone with a mother, sister or grandchild -- and someone with a story to tell. I know this.Poet, teacherObama\u0027s decision to launch a major new training cum advising project in Iraq to be augmented by up to 1,000 more American troops is revealing of how his administration\u0027s thinking about Iraq/ISIL/Syria is oriented. Clearly, there remains no coherent strategy; clearly, the incongruities and contradictions among of the various bits and pieces of policy.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghFor most of my life, I believed that all non-Jews hate us and want to kill us. I was told horrible things would happen to me in this world and the \"next world\" if I leave. I was told I would end up a criminal or drug addict. Many members of my family refuse to speak to me to this day.Actor, \u0027Felix and Meira,\u0027 \u0027Transparent\u0027There are no easy answers to these conundrums. The modern politics of identity demands equal and full respect for everyone\u0027s self-definition -- but respect is a limited resource.Lawyer, writer, and technologist.Look, at some point, the Christian church is going to need to dust off the old practices of a guy named Jesus, and simply start loving and caring for people where they are at.Author, spiritual leader, humorist and serial entrepreneurGiven the abundance of talent in Greece with not many other options to pursue, I truly believe that the startup-scene can generate star players. But we have to stay realistic.Creator, QuizdomAgainst an otherwise difficult investing backdrop, the rewards of investing \"local\" outweigh the risks. Small business investments offer a unique opportunity to generate attractive returns that are less correlated to public stock and bond markets.Runs Elvaston Capital Management, a Connecticut-based investment management firm focused on small business financeThe event has increased in size, awareness, donations and celebrity attendance, but it still remains all about family: those families impacted by childhood illness and seeking care from the incredible doctors and team at Children\u0027s Mercy.Actor, Comedian, Writer, U.S. MarineAs Horner explained in his 2009 book How to Build a Dinosaur: Extinction Doesn\u0027t Have to be Forever (and in his TED talk on de-extinction), you can turn on dormant genes to get them to build body parts, including a dino-like tail, snout and even teeth. Because of their availability, chickens work well, so Jack intends to build what he calls a \"Chickenosaurus.\"Founding publisher, Skeptic magazine; editor, Skeptic.comThe issue before us is not \"free trade,\" which, like any policy, has its pluses and minuses. The issue is that a multilateral trade agreement should not be negotiated in secret, but in the open by our State and Commerce departments, with input from all organizations concerned.Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyHistorian; Author, \u0027The LaFollettes of Wisconsin: Love and Politics in Progressive America\u0027Today is the 25th anniversary of \"Justice for Janitors Day,\" which commemorates an event that sparked one the most successful underpaid-worker campaigns in recent history: Justice for Janitors. But perhaps the most important contribution by janitors to our country has been how they have shaped today\u0027s broad and growing workers\u0027 movement.International Executive Vice President, Property Services Division, Service Employees International UnionWhy did parenting change from preparing our kids for life to protecting them from life, which means they\u0027re not prepared to live life on their own? And why do these problems I\u0027m writing about seem rooted in the middle and upper middle classes?Author, \u0027How to Raise an Adult\u0027; Former Dean of Freshman and Undergraduate Advising, Stanford UniversityClinton has been a polarizing figure throughout her career. In her Roosevelt Island speech, she portrayed herself as a fighter. But, ultimately, Clinton will have to be more publicly accountable for some of the legitimate questions that have been raised around her candidacy because they are not going away.Hofstra Journalism ProfessorKing Jeb only looks out for himself and people like him. He never has, and never will, fight for middle class families. And even though Americans already know what a Bush presidency will mean for them, Jeb Bush still plans to run for President in 2016.Author, \u0027For the Next Generation\u0027; Chair, Democratic National CommitteeIf you think costs would come down if hospitals were all owned and operated by big for-profit corporations like Hospital Corporation of America, you might want to take a look at a study published last week by the journal Health Affairs.Author, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgOne thing to come out of all of this that I find amazing and beautiful is the Twitter hashtag #AskRachel, which started as a sarcastic way to mock and test Rachel\u0027s perceived lack of Black bonafides and morphed into a sort of digital family reunion, an electronic walk down memory lane for Black people nationwide.Writer, SUM CityTo understand what comes next, it\u0027s worth unpacking what exactly happened on Friday and how we got there.Director, Public Citizen\u0027s Global Trade WatchThere\u0027s nothing wrong with going full tourist when you\u0027re visiting a new state--you\u0027d be blowing it if you didn\u0027t make time for a trip to The Statue of Liberty or the Golden Gate.The coolest stuff that money can buy, and more.What if we decided not to follow the crowd? What if it became an option to never shave or only shave if we wanted to? What if we freed ourselves from the judgement of ourselves and others? What if it stopped being radical? What if there was no standard?writer, student, mental health advocate, humanA person\u0027s seizure experience is unique to the individual. Having seizures is a major inconvenience to our lives. It\u0027s not fun. It\u0027s unsettling. It\u0027s uncomfortable. We don\u0027t want it in our lives. We want it gone. Forever. These are my experiences.Founder, The Epilepsy NetworkI say \"don\u0027t hate the player, hate the game.\" Race is the game. We want to believe in its realness; its authenticity; its power as a marker. That\u0027s ideology.Associate Professor of History and American Studies, Connecticut CollegeAfter George W. Bush\u0027s tenure in office came to a conclusion, Republicans who were hoping Jeb Bush could succeed him in 2008 and 2012 asked me about his chances. \"He\u0027d do better, right? He\u0027s the smarter of the two, right?\" Sadly, as Jeb\u0027s 2016 campaign struggles, it has confirmed the responses I gave several years ago. He\u0027s not the wiser brother.Political science professor, LaGrange College in GeorgiaThe status of negotiations between Greece and its official creditors -- the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF -- dominated headlines last week.  At the core of the negotiations is a simple question: How much of an adjustment has to be made by Greece, how much has to be made by its official creditors?Economic Counsellor and Director of the Research Department, International Monetary FundGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
