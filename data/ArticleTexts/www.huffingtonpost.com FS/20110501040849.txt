{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This was a big week for big distractions. First, there was President Obama\u0027s televised press conference to discuss not jobs or Afghanistan or Syria, but the release of his long-form birth certificate. Yes, it\u0027s ridiculous that the president should be forced to show his papers to prove his legitimacy -- but couldn\u0027t he have sent his lawyer to Hawaii in 2008 and saved us the spectacle of Donald Trump claiming to have \"accomplished something really, really important\" by being proven dead wrong?
