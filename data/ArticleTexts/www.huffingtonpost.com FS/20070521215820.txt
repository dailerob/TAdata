{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"APDuring Hillary Clinton\u0027s interview with Matt Lauer on the Today Show this morning, we saw why, as Democrats continue to push for an end to the war, the devil will most certainly be in the details. And pretending everyone is on the same page will do little to either end the war or help voters decide which candidate to support. Which is exactly how Hillary wants it. Her broad-brush attempt to blur her shape-shifting approach to Iraq is a favorite of pro-war Democrats desperately trying to align themselves with the majority of the American people, at least until the election.
