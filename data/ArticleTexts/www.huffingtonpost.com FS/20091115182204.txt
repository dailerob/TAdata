{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOPrepare for the latest Palin media onslaught. An hour with Oprah, a multi-parter with Barbara, and appearances all across the country. An initial read shows Going Rogue doesn\u0027t reveal much. No surprise there. This isn\u0027t about the book, it\u0027s about the book tour -- which includes a politically convenient stop in Iowa -- and the money. Besides, it\u0027s not like there\u0027s much we haven\u0027t already learned about Palin since she burst onto the national scene. We even know when her water broke during her last pregnancy. Talk about overexposed. In the end, I expect this will be one of the most mocked books of the year -- and one of the biggest bestsellers. Palin fans will find much to love, but I doubt a single doubter will be converted. It\u0027s a 400 page Rorschach test. With no index.Read Post | Comments (50)BIOBob Woodruff, 11.10.2009Journalist; The Bob Woodruff FoundationThis Veterans Day, after we raise the flag, we must raise awareness about wars hidden injuries, and what\u0027s required for injured service members, families and caregivers to have safe futures.Read Post | Comments (56)BIOQueen Rania of Jordan, 11.09.2009Queen of the Hashemite Kingdom of JordanFor me, and for so many other people around the world, the anniversary is bittersweet.
