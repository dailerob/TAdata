{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Children\u0027s Defense FundOver this long holiday weekend, children will be gathering in towns and cities around the country ooh-ing and aah-ing over fireworks, marching in parades, proud of their heritage and proudly waving the American flag. Most of them still believe in the promise of America -- a promise reflected in the Pledge of Allegiance. But today the promise of America\u0027s Pledge is in jeopardy, and right now many of our elected officials are letting another pledge take precedence -- a no-new-taxes pledge. They are putting this before the pledge to the flag, and to the republic for which it stands, and to the promise of liberty and justice for all.Read Post | CommentsCarlo Strenger, 07.01.2011Chair, Clinical Graduate Program, Department of Psychology, Tel Aviv UniversityWhile the damage to Dominique Strauss-Kahn\u0027s life and career cannot be mended, he now stands to be publicly vindicated, and there is a good chance that, at least in France, his honor will be restored. Not all victims of the press\u0027s hunger for scandal are as lucky.Read Post | CommentsAmb. Vassilis Kaskarelis, 07.01.2011Greek Ambassador to the United StatesGreece and its people take responsibility for their own failings and have launched an unprecedented effort to make them right.

The media is not liberal, and Mark Halperin\u0027s distasteful remark about President Obama on cable TV gives us a glimpse into precisely why this is so.Read Post | CommentsKerry Trueman, 07.01.2011Co-founder of EatingLiberally.orgNo wonder Uncle Sam looks so pained; he\u0027s been getting his arm twisted by lobbyists for nearly a hundred years. And food is no different.Read Post | CommentsDaniel Altschuler, 07.01.2011Political scientistIn Georgia, farmers are finding it nearly impossible to replace the immigrant workers who are fleeing the state in fear of a draconian piece of legislation that mirrors provisions of Arizona\u0027s controversial SB 1070.Read Post | CommentsRep. John D. Dingell, 07.01.2011Longest-serving Member of the House of RepresentativesFor the Republicans to say they are reforming Medicare, not ending it, is like putting feathers on a fish and trying to say it is a duck; you aren\u0027t fooling this poor Polish lawyer into believing it is the same program.Read Post | CommentsJaime King, 07.01.2011Actress, writer, directorRachel Zoe is the most iconic stylist of our generation.

I Say\u0027I\u0027ve decided that I don\u0027t care what pop music means anymore to anyone else. I only care about what\u0027s popular with me.

And they\u0027re often doing so in the name of religion and God.Read Post | CommentsSteve Clemons, 07.01.2011Publisher, \u0027The Washington Note\u0027In today\u0027s fast-paced world, a reputation can be destroyed rapidly -- and if, as in the case of Strauss-Kahn it seems, the consequences of charges made actually precede the processing of those charges.Read Post | CommentsRoger I.

Carolyn Bennett, 07.01.2011MP, Liberal Party of CanadaOnly now are we starting to address the damage done by the colonization which refused to acknowledge the rights and respect the culture of the First Peoples of Canada.
