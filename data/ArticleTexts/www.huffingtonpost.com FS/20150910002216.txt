{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor Emerita, USC Marshall School; Author, \u0027The Secret Handshake\u0027 and \u0027Shadow Campus\u0027All political candidates dissemble. Indeed, all people do. A degree of deception is required in order to be civil. \"It was a pleasure to meet you,\" is often just a way to gracefully exit a conversation. But at what point does a political candidate take deception too far? In Hillary Clinton\u0027s case, that is a critical question. Andrea Mitchell told Clinton she has an authenticity problem. S.A. Miller of the Washington Times described Clinton\u0027s \"authenticity gap\" as a major issue for her coming up to the New Hampshire primary. What does it mean to be authentic, particularly an authentic politician? The term may seem an oxymoron. Politics by nature is about strategy, knowing what to say when, in what way, and to whom. Where is the room for authenticity?I fear that many of my Republican colleagues do not understand that war must be a last resort, not the first resort. It is easy to go to war, it not so easy to comprehend the unintended consequences of that war.U.S. Senator from VermontCongress shall make no law prohibiting the free exercise of religion. The question (and it is a question that cannot be answered by just parsing the text) is, What does it mean to freely exercise one\u0027s religion?Davidson-Kahn Distinguished University Professor and Professor of Law at Florida International University; Floershimer Distinguished Visiting Professor of Law at Cardozo Law SchoolOpening the new community toilet may lack the glamour of cutting the ribbon on a new hospital, so fewer politicians lobby for their communities to gain sanitation.Chief Executive of WaterAidWe cannot continue indefinitely to strike at jihadists in Iraq while stopping, absurdly, at the border of the neighboring state.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.Today we launched a campaign will make it possible for all of America to be great. Not just Silicon Valley or Hollywood. Not just Nashville or Broadway. Not just the heartland or the White Mountains. But even Washington, D.C. too. Today we have launched a campaign to give us a government we can be proud of again.Law professor, activist, candidate in the Democratic Primary for PresidentCongress is back, and they\u0027re already moaning about how much they have to do in September. After all, they\u0027ve got an upcoming budgetary train wreck to create, the Pope is going to visit and -- first on their list of looming deadlines -- they\u0027re supposed to vote on the Iran nuclear deal.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comNew York has long been overdo for a Sarah Charlesworth retrospective. Throughout the summer of 2015, the New Museum filled the void with Doubleword a partial-survey of Charlesworth\u0027s work curated by Massimiliano Gioni and Margot Norton, a most welcome arrival.Cultural critic, essayist and novelist published with Parkett, Art in America and Bijutsu TechoThere was a moment at a recent rally when the nature of the tuition beast was suddenly, and unforgettably, revealed; when \"Mandy,\" an anonymous NYU junior, took the stage to tell exactly how, and why, she had no choice but to become a prostitute to meet NYU\u0027s soaring price.Professor of Culture and Communication, New York UniversityInstalling toilets in India without addressing behavioral change has resulted in thousands of free toilets becoming storage sheds or chicken coops, while the owners continue to defecate outside.Founder, World Toilet Organization and BOP HUBThis book explores the gruesome misdeeds of a murderer (and rapist), but it is also an extended reflection on how and why one might write about, and even befriend, such people. On both counts, it is an admirable success.Author, \u0027The Catonsville Nine: A Story of Faith and Resistance in the Vietnam Era\u0027It\u0027s expensive to be poor. So expensive in fact that people who live below a country\u0027s poverty line can end up paying 5-15x per liter of water compared to people who live above that poverty line.Chief executive officer and co-founder of Water.orgActor and Co-founder, Water.orgMore is at stake than individual health; international security is at risk. Experts have identified water as the number one global risk in terms of significant negative impact on countries in the coming decade. Water can either be a source of conflict or cooperation.Deputy Secretary-General, United NationsGovernor John Kasich (R - OH) worries that the Kentucky spectacle of Christian extremism will turn people away from religion. He is right to worry. I am disgusted by the un-American, hypocritical, mean-spirited rallies and shows of support for Kim Davis.Professor of Theater, Ursinus CollegeThe K2 drug scare has become inextricably linked to the East Harlem\u0027s homelessness problem, particularly to the corner of 125th and Lexington, which has long had a significant population of homeless people and is also the site of increasing gentrification.New York deputy state director, Drug Policy AllianceWhat we are looking at is a middle class that is dying, literally, and a party that supposedly represents them holding their head under water. As long as the GOP fights middle class progress they will have a difficult time reaching the votes they need outside of rural areas and winning the presidency.Former Intelligence Specialist, Veteran, WriterThe refugees I have known didn\u0027t feel entitled to anything. They hated living off of food stamps, welfare, government cheese, and in an internment-like and/or poverty stricken communities. But they appreciated the assistance, making the best of what came their way.Host of Finding Rebecca podcast and multi-dimensional freelancer.The Broncos, widely used in the Vietnam war, were delivered to Indonesia in 1977-1978, when the slaughter of the Timorese civilian population was at its worst. Torture and mass executions were commonplace. Political prisoners were dropped live from helicopters, entire villages purposely starved to death, and more. Most Americans are little aware of either of these events.Former President, East Timor, 1996 Nobel Peace Prize laureateDonald Trump may not be Ronald Reagan, but the Ronald Reagan that whipped Jeb\u0027s father was not the saint of people\u0027s imagination either. Jeb might have the better resume, he might be a man of compassion, but neither experience nor compassion are the currencies of the moment.President, Fiscal Strategies GroupThe school-to-prison pipeline is a no-nonsense trend in American education, where children are directed straight from the classroom and into the bureaucratic clutches of the criminal justice system.Journalist, author and advocate for global reform of the prison system.Our global economic and political system is the root cause of the problem, so instead of blaming Europe, lets fix the problemNow we witness the return of the medium in Greece, after six whole years. Will it influence something this time? It would be difficult, but it is not impossible. While voters remain reluctant and morose, and political leaders fail, it may play a role.Editor-At-Large, HuffPost GreeceAs with marriage reform, the bulk of the action with marijuana legalization has been at the state level, with most members of Congress hesitant to express support until public opinion moves well past the tipping point. This is starting to change.Executive director, Marijuana Policy ProjectIt\u0027s time to stop these distractions from what is the real threat to people of color. We are not threatened by having and exercising the right for women to make decisions about their own bodies. What is threatening are the continued efforts, decades after the end of Jim Crow, to bar us from our own democracy.Director of African American Religious Affairs, People For the American Way and People For the American Way FoundationThe news business has devolved into just another branch of the entertainment business. Many are well aware of this. Few, though, appreciate the degree to which even the elite media -- e.g., The New York Times -- contribute to the phenomenon.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghThe efforts of Black Lives Matter protesters have forced a long overdue conversation about entrenched brutality and racism in American policing. It seems like opponents are using a handful of unfortunately worded expressions of black anger to avoid -- or destroy -- the discussion.Writer, SUM CityMs. Coulter outlines why she believes immigration to be America\u0027s greatest threat -- an idea that has been embraced by many leaders on the right, including current GOP frontrunner Donald Trump.PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorDr. Michael Breus is a clinical psychologist and author of The Sleep Doctor\u0027s Diet Plan: Lose Weight Through Better Sleep. In answer to my questions, he shared his thoughts on the major obstacles to getting a good night\u0027s sleep, the steps you can take to improve your sleep, and the future of sleep technology.Cooperation must be based on trust in order to be effective. And because the United States is still the biggest kid on the block, we must take the initiative in quieting the China-bashing rhetoric to begin the transition to a trusting and genuinely cooperative relationship.Confucian scholarThere are plenty of things wrong with the labor movement. It can be overly bureaucratic. There are corrupt officials in many unions. But there should be no doubt that the country is much better off as a result of the labor movement and prospects for progressive change would be brighter if it were stronger.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Black Lives Matter is far from a perfect organization, but contrary to what the conservative media would have you believe, the only special treatment BLM is asking for is to not be treated special.Political blogger, Detroit NewsGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
