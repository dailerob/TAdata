{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Global Editorial DirectorPoor Brussels. It’s the capital of a country that all too often has been a theater of war in Europe. This time the carnage created another opportunity for bellicosity from the U.S. candidates -- not just Republicans Trump and Cruz, but Democrat Hillary Clinton. In one way or another, they further distanced themselves from Obama’s message of open-handed engagement. That message featured in the defining speech of Obama’s presidency, delivered in 2009 in Cairo, but aimed at not only the Muslim world but the planet. If there is an “Obama Doctrine,” he enunciated it then -- a sunburst of optimism and empathy that soon thereafter won him the Nobel Peace Prize. But seven years later, as the 2016 presidential campaign gains in intensity, it’s clear that “Obamaism” is a lost cause, at least for now.Try to imagine your local sheriff\u0027s department picking and choosing streets to patrol based on the (perceived) religious identity of the residents. It\u0027s not a pretty picture.Activist, blogger, waylaid CalifornianTrump and Cruz pretend to be opposed to the Republican establishment, but when it comes to taxes they\u0027re seeking exactly what that Republican establishment wants.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027Have we passed a point of no return, is ice melt sure to increase so that AMOC shutdown is a foregone conclusion? I doubt it, but it\u0027s conceivable, depending on how fast we slow down human-made climate forcing. I think the conclusion is clear. We are in a position of potentially causing irreparable harm to our children, grandchildren and future generations.Climatologist and Adjunct Professor, Columbia University Earth InstituteNothing contributes to bolstering its self-image more than being treated like a state with its own army and militants. We are giving the terrorists an honor that they certainly don\u0027t deserve.Special Advisor, Foundation for Strategic Research, ParisDear Cherished Friends, The Republican Party has become intellectually and morally bankrupt, a mockery of its traditions -- corrosive to our society, our civility, and our capacity to govern. Unless and until it reverses course, you should take your votes and money and walk away.Novelist and contributing opinion writerFor the past year and a half, my oldest child has been studying at a university in Amsterdam. So far, so good. But on the heels of this morning\u0027s news of terrorist attacks in Belgium, he said something that rocked me to my core: \"It seems as though the bombings are getting closer.\"Senior Editor, The Huffington PostThe EU crisis is intrinsically linked with the Syrian civil war. The sudden onslaught of refugees and rise of ISIS made it impossible to remain a distant observer.Contributing WriterThis is how things are in Brussels today. We found ourselves locked up in Parliament. Suspending activities. We called for moments of silence. We changed travel plans. We are waiting for news.Spanish Socialist Workers Party deputy, European ParliamentIn the United States, we get the Freedoms To: TO choose our own careers, TO move whenever we like (if we can afford it), TO speak out against our government (even if it does no good) -- while Cubans get... yeah, pretty much none of that. In Cuba, meanwhile, they get the Freedoms From: FROM hunger, FROM illiteracy, FROM homelessness, FROM lack of medical care, FROM expensive education -- while we Americans get, well, exactly none of that, ever.Bestselling authorBoth journalists and politicians believe the general public is as disinterested in science as they are. They think of it as an unorganized and somewhat quixotic special interest without much voting power. Polling shows they are wrong.Political advisor, writer, novelist, filmmaker, science advocatePerhaps because we both were engineering graduates of City College, Andy Grove and I hit it off. He was tough and confrontational, but also witty. He was opinionated but respected good journalism.Founding Dean of the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York from 2005 to 2013Is there sexism in the lives of American girls? I wasn\u0027t aware of just how much until I started talking to girls about their experiences online, which happened sort of by accident one night in Los Angeles in 2013.Author, \u0027American Girls: Social Media and the Secret Lives of Teenagers\u0027People who are protesting Donald Trump\u0027s events are not infringing on his first amendment rights or his speech in any way. If Donald Trump decides to shut down his events (because of his own reckless past speech and what it has inspired in his followers) that is his choice.Queer Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostInsurance coverage for contraception should not be determined by where a woman works or goes to school. It\u0027s shortsighted and wrong for some employers to use their religious beliefs to deny women the vital care they need to make the best decisions for themselves and their loved ones.President \u0026 CEO, National Family Planning \u0026 Reproductive Health AssociationBy reaching out to Castro, Mr. Obama would not only reinforce the idea that grown ups resolve their differences face to face, he would show respect for -- not agreement with -- someone the vast majority of Cubans still deeply admire, despite their many criticisms.Historian, Photographer, CriticIt\u0027s what pushed me to train for the Olympics, and ultimately win the decathlon gold medal in \u002776. It\u0027s what gave me the strength to finally make my transition to Caitlyn and start living my true self. Needless to say, these words inspire me daily.Public speaker, activist, OlympianPoliticians from across the political spectrum are going to call for strong and swift responses and claim that this ‘new threat’ requires more competencies for the security services. They are going to promise to ‘keep us safe,’ even though they know that they can never guarantee full security.Associate Professor in the School of Public and International Affairs at the University of GeorgiaIranians recently voted for a new parliament as well as Assembly of Experts, tasked with choosing the successor to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Moderate reformers did well in both bodies, vindicating the Obama administration\u0027s decision to try diplomacy after years of confrontation.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteConsidering today\u0027s attacks as simply a hot-headed vendetta for the capture of Salah Abdeslam does not help us get a grip on the size of the monster that Belgium has let grow and expand inside its borders.Investigative Journalist, HuffPost ItalyIn the decades since the draft ended in 1973, a strange new military has emerged in the United States. Think of it, if you will, as a post-democratic force that prides itself on its warrior ethos rather than the old-fashioned citizen-soldier ideal.Retired lieutenant colonel (USAF)Journalist and artistIt\u0027s not that Trump is just dangerously ignorant about foreign policy. It\u0027s that his witlessness is lathered with an unprecedented degree of narcissistic prejudice and unbalanced hubris.Fmr. U.S. Ambassador to Morocco; White House Middle East AdviserFor all of his bravado, obnoxiousness, hatred, and vitriol, the scariest thing about Trump to me is his unique combination of ignorance about the world, convolved with ignorance about himself.Director of the Origins Project at Arizona State University; Author, \u0027A Universe From Nothing\u0027World TB Day becomes a façade if the events that mark it are not tied to specific actions. The children affected by DR-TB have given us a clear mandate to which we should all pledge ourselves on this commemorative day: make it stop.Infectious diseases specialist and medical anthropologist currently a lecturer at Harvard Medical SchoolThe TPP will put into question every health, safety, and environmental regulation that governments at any level seek to implement. The assurances from the Obama administration to the contrary on this front are absolutely worthless.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Sure, it\u0027s funny -- when you first consider it. But then the more you think about it, the more sense it actually makes. After all, is \"Trump/Ventura 2016\" really that much more outlandish than \"Donald Trump, Republican presidential nominee\" first sounded?Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comPeople support presidential candidates for a variety of reasons, and instead of jumping to conclusions about the character of those who disagree with us, we should listen to those reasons and evaluate them on their merits. At the same time, ethics and evidence matter.34Justice co-founder and bloggerIt\u0027s time liberals acknowledge that their vitriol toward the presidential candidate is hurting women? -- and speaks to something deeper.Comedian, actress and writerA Long Walk to Water has electrified young readers across the country and inspired many of them to raise money to build more wells in South Sudan.Founder and CEO, CausecastThere was a time when civility and courtesy were considered traditional values, yet today\u0027s Conservatives compete with one another to be as impolite and demeaning as possible. Their opponents are always branded with demeaning epithets.President, Moorfield Storey InstituteGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
