{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoWhat makes the House Republicans\u0027 decision to shut down the federal government an immoral and unconscionable \"threat\" rather than an ordinary political disagreement? The answer is simple. House Republicans who do not have the votes to repeal Obamacare through the processes of democracy threatened to close the federal government, to throw hundreds of thousands of innocent government employees out of work, and to damage the nation\u0027s economy unless the Senate and the President acceded to their demands. By threatening to wreak havoc with the national interest and inflicting serious harm on hard-working, loyal public employees, they are attempting to coerce rather than to persuade the government into doing what they want. The House Republicans, in short, are holding the nation itself hostage to their demands. This is not democratic governance. This is extortion, plain and simple. In any other circumstance, this would be criminal conduct.Comments (1,468)John KaoChair, Institute for Large Scale InnovationWhen I imagine national security strategists sitting around trying to figure out what lies around the next corner, I hope they will spend at least part of their time reading Tom Clancy and the Tom Clancys to come.Comments (49)Julie ZiemelisZiemelis CommunicationsYou send pictures of what you did on the weekend to your friends on the mainland and they write things like, \"Stop, you\u0027re killing me!\" You see people standing on the walk way outside of the hotels and resorts with their bags packed waiting to go home. And you feel sorry for them.Comments (146)Sally SteenlandDirector, the Faith and Progressive Policy Initiative, Center for American ProgressModern Republicans\u0027 callousness and willingness to overburden the poor evokes another act of state villainy -- one that is especially pertinent because Republican leaders so often invoke the Bible.Comments (275)Kathleen ReardonProfessor, USC Marshall School; Author, \u0027The Secret Handshake\u0027 and \u0027Shadow Campus\u0027The Republicans have chosen not to be good, not to be fair, not to be rational in the common sense of these words. Since they can\u0027t win, their goal is to \"win\" by disallowing a win by the opposition and then to worry about explanations later.Comments (127)James ClearEntrepreneur, weightlifter, and travel photographerReally successful people feel the same boredom and the same lack of motivation that everyone else feels. But the difference is that the people who stick with their goals don\u0027t let their emotions determine their actions.Comments (17)Sen. Jay RockefellerU.S. Senator, West VirginiaWhat Americans got from the Affordable Care Act was a thoughtful law that brings us closer than ever before to the goal of affordable health care for all, while simultaneously lifting from our economy the heavy burden of runaway health costs.CommentsChris Dodd and Dr. Bill FristWhen we served together in the Senate, we found ourselves on different sides of a variety of issues. But when it came to common-sense measures that benefitted our country and our citizens, we pulled together.CommentsKami GarciaBestselling AuthorLots of people like to go on ghost tours, especially around Halloween. Personally, I prefer un-ghost tours. Even though my new novel, \"Unbreakable,\" follows a secret society of ghost hunters, I would never hang out in a haunted place.Comments (121)Egemen BagisTurkey\u0027s Minister for EU Affairs and Chief NegotiatorNow we have crossed a critical threshold for our democracy and our EU accession process. Turkey is at a new beginning and on its journey towards an even brighter future -- it is proudly distancing away from the shackles of the past.CommentsKia MakarechiEntertainment Editor, The Huffington PostWe\u0027ll know when Hollywood casting directors and the Academy view people of color as deserving of equal opportunities to shine when a black man in the role of a fictional caring father, son, teacher, student, doctor, journalist or otherwise non-racially coded character is nominated for and wins Best Actor.Comments (679)Evelyn LeopoldVeteran journalist reporting from the United NationsSeeking to discourage a rapprochement between Washington and Tehran, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel threatened military action against Iran and dared others to do the same.Comments (105)Frances BeineckePresident, Natural Resources Defense CouncilRepublicans have put America\u0027s health and environment in jeopardy with their shutdown tactics. The question is: will they learn from their error or do it all again in two weeks when the debt ceiling must be lifted?CommentsJack WelchFounder, Jack Welch Management Institute at Strayer University; Former CEO, General ElectricThe blame game goes on and on and the government stays shuttered. And meanwhile, the people watching the story play out -- and, I would say, especially leaders in business -- might be missing the most important lesson of it all.Comments (82)Francisco EnriquezFederal Tax and Budget Associate, U.S. PIRGIs $4 billion in taxpayer money better spent subsidizing JPMorgan\u0027s alleged criminal activity or funding the federal agency charged with defending consumers from dangerous financial products?Comments (28)Kat GrosshauptCrossfit coach, hypnobirthing instructor, momThis \"issue\" of whether CrossFit is safe or not or if moms are harming their babies and putting them at risk has about 50 percent to do with exercise itself, but it also has to do with, in my very vocal opinion, trusting that women know what they are doing with regard to their bodies.CommentsOliver TearleAuthor; Lecturer in English, Loughborough Univ.Shakespeare may have been the first one to think of putting \"leap\" and \"frog\" together to form \"leapfrog\" -- but wouldn\u0027t his audience have wondered what the hell he was blathering on about? So, here are 20 words which we can say, with some certainty, originated in works of literature.CommentsDr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarThe trick with selfies may be to look at why you\u0027re taking them -- and what they do for you. Posting affirming selfies can be empowering. But they can also help reinforce the idea that what matters most in this world is how things, and people, look.Comments (28)Stephen SchlesingerAuthor and Fellow at the Century FoundationUndoubtedly the UN in the last few weeks has emerged strengthened as an universal security organization by the events in Iran and Syria despite warnings about its imminent demise. But there is nothing new about the UN\u0027s emergence as a peacemaker.CommentsRoots of PeaceWe\u0027re turning mines to vines that truly build roots of peace by making farmland usable again.CommentsDaphne EviatarSenior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstA little government shut-down wasn\u0027t going to deter Army Colonel James Pohl. While most federal employees were furloughed, the judge presiding over the 9/11 case at the Guantanamo Bay military commissions on Tuesday insisted the pre-trial hearings continue apace.CommentsJason LinkinsEditor, Eat the PressMonday night\u0027s bicameral back and forth between the House GOP and the Senate ended in the way everyone saw coming: a shutdown of the federal government, owing to the House Republicans\u0027 refusal to simply send the Senate the \"clean\" continuing resolution that everyone knew would have ended the futile contretemps right then and there.Comments (1,143)H. Adam Ackley, Ph.D.Ordained minister, Church of Brethren; former professor of theology, Azusa Pacific University; ordained minister in the Church of the BrethrenI have recently been informed that I am being asked to leave my university teaching post of 15 years for \"violating Christian values\" as a Christian theology professor and ordained minister who identifies as transgender.CommentsGrover NorquistPresident, Americans for Tax ReformIn normal times the Republican House and Democrat Senate would meet in conference committees and hash out each budget. But that has not happened under Obama. There has been no compromising or negotiations or even civility.Comments (462)Morgan GuytonAssociate Pastor, Burke United Methodist ChurchOn the eve of our government shutdown, I wanted to do some research into the theological roots of Senator Ted Cruz, the standard-bearer of the Tea Party Republicans behind the shutdown.Comments (587)Andrew HarperEditor, Hideaway ReportFor those of us in more temperate climes, fall is the time to arrange winter beach escapes. I hope these suggestions inspire a relaxing beach vacation in your near future.CommentsHoward FinemanEditorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupAs much as showing me a father\u0027s quiet love, my dad taught me life lessons by using the history and proper practices of baseball as his guide. He had been a ball player as a kid, and a lifelong student of the game.Comments (26)Michael BolenHuffPost Canada News EditorWhen a man tries to discuss the particular challenges facing his gender today, he is often labelled sexist or misogynist by women who feel it\u0027s ridiculous for a privileged demographic to whine about its difficulties.Comments (170)Morris W. O\u0027KellyHost of \"The Mo\u0027Kelly Show\" on KFI AM640/XM Satellite Radio and \"Mo\u0027Kelly in the Morning\" on KTLK AM1150This ideological battle is not about changing a law, but subverting the Constitution. The Constitution is clear about how we change and amend laws. A shutdown is not one of the listed remedies.Comments (353)Sen. Bernie SandersIndependent U.S. Senator from VermontIt is unconscionable that in one of the most advanced nations in the world, there are nearly 50 million people who lack health insurance and millions more who have burdensome copayments and deductibles.Comments (1,182)Rachel M. MartinWriter, Findingjoy.netI want my kids to remember that there were times when their mother looked them in the eye and smiled. And for me, this often means shutting my laptop, putting down my phone, taking a break from my my to-do list and just giving them time.Comments (82)Udoka Okafor, 2013. 2.10Jim Moret, 2013. 2.10Carl Pope, 2013. 2.10Bob Comis, 2013. 2.10David Katz, M.D., 2013. 2.10Karen Mills, 2013. 2.10Paul Gorrell, Ph.D., 2013. 2.10Mary Ellen Harte, 2013. 2.10Paul Szep, 2013. 2.10Chris Weigant, 2013. 2.10Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"SPEAKER SPINELESS Boehner Could End Shutdown If He Wanted To...
