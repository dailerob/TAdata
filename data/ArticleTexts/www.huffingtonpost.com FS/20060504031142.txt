{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"From flagsplus.comFrom thebosh.comToday\u0027s HuffPost Featured lineup includes a collection of takes on relationships, triggered by Kathy Freston\u0027s terrific new book, The One. How do you know you\u0027ve found your soul mate? According to Kathy, the clearest sign is \"that you like who you\u0027re becoming when you\u0027re with this person.\" I love how this notion takes the idea of finding \"the one\" out of the fairy tale land of Prince Charmings sweeping us off our feet and puts the onus squarely on ourselves. It\u0027s all about finding your best self, not losing yourself in another.Schedule Note: As part of the LA Times Festival of Books, I\u0027ll be interviewing Gore Vidal on Saturday at 3 o\u0027clock; and taking part in a panel discussion on the media on Sunday morning at 10 am. If you live in LA, stop by and say hello.READ POST | comments04.28.2006 Kathy FrestonI love talking about relationships. I love how people\u0027s eyes light up and they sort of snap to attention when trying to get their mind around the concept of \"soul mates.\"READ POST | comments04.28.2006 Susan SmalleyWe usually forget how attached we are to ourselves. Joining in a deep relationship with someone requires a stepping outside of our \"self-centered\" world-view.READ POST04.28.2006 Philip WeissMarriage is the most difficult of relationships. You can fire your boss or your therapist. But your spouse is your coal mine. You have to show up every day.READ POST | comments04.28.2006 Shari FoosLet\u0027s get something straight: the concept of finding one\u0027s soul mate is merely an (unscientific) mathematical problemREAD POST04.28.2006 Michael WeinbergerOur life played like the family sitcoms we wrote, facile, wacky and mindless fun. That is, until the day Jakie was diagnosed with colon cancer and our personal script turned into a tragedy.READ POST04.28.2006 Marja AdrianceIt was a setup. The only thing I knew about him was that he was a \"good catch\" -- a writer on a major TV show that I didn\u0027t watch who played golf with my boss\u0027 manager.READ POST | comments04.28.2006 Mona GableIs any relationship harder than marriage? I am sitting here mulling this over because my husband and I had a little tiff a few days ago.READ POST04.28.2006 Lisa CronIt was the day before Mother\u0027s Day. Stuart was sitting on the couch working on the jigsaw puzzle, he\u0027d started it the day he arrived.READ POST | comments04.28.2006 Susan SawyersWhat I do (or don\u0027t do) as a mother/wife/professional is my choice. And only I can decide what works for me. And frankly, it\u0027s not always easy being me...and me. I\u0027m doing the best I can.READ POST04.28.2006 Robert WeissmanThe tobacco industry has long been at the cutting edge of corporate irresponsibility. Now Philip Morris is planning a new escape from accountability.READ POST | comments04.28.2006 Sherman YellenJulia Roberts\u0027 attempting the stage was an act of courage. She failed, but the consequences did not affect the larger world, only her pride and her ambitions.
