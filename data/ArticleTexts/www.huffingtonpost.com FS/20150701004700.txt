{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor at Columbia University and a Nobel Laureate in EconomicsPostdoctoral Research Fellow Columbia University GSBAt last, after years of blackmailing Greece and demanding ever more austerity that led to a catastrophic economic depression, the Troika has finally pushed the country into the brink of default. The situation has some important similarities with Argentina\u0027s 2001 default -- and some differences as well. In both countries, recessions turned into depressions as a consequence of austerity policies -- making the debt even more unsustainable. In both cases, the policies were demanded as a condition for assistance. Defaults are difficult. But even more so is austerity. The good news for Greece is that, as Argentina showed, there may be life after debt and default.Right now, too many Americans are working long days for less pay than they deserve. That\u0027s partly because we\u0027ve failed to update overtime regulations for years -- and an exemption meant for highly paid, white collar employees now leaves out workers making as little as $23,660 a year -- no matter how many hours they work.44th President of the United StatesIn King v. Burwell, decided last Thursday, the Supreme Court has once again (no doubt inadvertently) given us a lesson in the philosophy of language. The dispute in the case is over the meaning of the phrase \"exchange established by the state.\"Davidson-Kahn Distinguished University Professor and Professor of Law at Florida International UniversityRoland Dupree wasn\u0027t a household name. But \"legendary\" fits. As a performer, a teacher and as a real life success story, he deserves to be remembered and honored among Hollywood\u0027s greatest not only because of what he accomplished, but how he accomplished it.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027As a working TV and feature film writer in Hollywood, I have been fortunate enough to sell a couple of pilots to NBC. But I am also one of those immigrants from Mexico Donald Trump talked about -- except I\u0027ve never raped anyone, I am not a criminal and I have never done or sold drugs.Writer/Executive Producer of the award-winning film \"La Misma Luna\" (\"Under the Same Moon\"), Humanitas Prize WinnerThe United States is the wealthiest nation in the history of the world. Why are we so far behind so many other countries when it comes to meeting the needs of working families and the American middle class?Democratic candidate for President, US Senator from VermontOver the next few days, leaders from cities, local governments and other organizations around the world will gather in Lyon, France. It is an important step toward COP21, the UN conference on climate change that will happen in Paris in December. The bold actions taken not only by local leaders but also by all the range of non-state actors to reduce greenhouse gases place them at the forefront of the fight against climate change.Fmr. three-term mayor of New York City; Founder of Bloomberg Philanthropies and Bloomberg LPMayor of ParisOf all the announced Republican candidates -- and those still queuing up this summer -- Christie, without question, enjoyed the most unique and encouraging relationship with the Beltway press corps. For years, there was an almost tribal affection for Christie and his bullying personality among the Acela media class.Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaCurrently, the Federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour or roughly $15,000 annually, far below the $23,500 government\u0027s poverty threshold for a family of four. Some candidates have already made their positions on the minimum wage clear, but there are many that still have not.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorIf Russia does not seize the opportunity to bail out Greece, we can conclude that the Russian economy is in much worse shape than anticipated. There is also an interesting observation to be made behind the gunpowder smoke in Ukraine, Iran\u0027s alleged nuclear weapons program and several other geopolitical issues.Author, \u0027The Global Economy in Transition\u0027Rather than responsibly dealing with the economic challenges facing New Jersey, Governor Christie has played politics with workers\u0027 retirement security and cut investments in infrastructure that would promote economic growth.Executive Director of the National Public Pension Coalition.We need to summon the political will to create -- for the first time -- an American labor force of committed citizens that reaches across boundaries of class, race, gender, and religion and involves all Americans. Only then can those in despair envision a future in which they and their children live useful lives as contributing members of our society.Public historian in residence, Bard College, and former director, Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum.The current mess is likely only a harbinger of things to come if industrialized nations don\u0027t dramatically reduce carbon emissions. Drought and desertification already ruin thousands of square miles of productive land annually, while rising sea levels could eventually force tens if not hundreds of millions of people from their coastal homes.Senior Writer, Union of Concerned ScientistsOn the surface, this adjustment seems like a boon for American workers. Ironically, however, while the rule would make more employees eligible for overtime pay, it might result in workers being worse off than before.Associate Professor, Washburn University School of LawIn the past six months I\u0027ve spent more time with a 61-year-old formerly homeless man than I have with many of my friends and family. As our friendship developed, I wondered what would happen if we approached homeless people like we do new relationships: with openness to learning about the other person.Blog Editor, The Huffington PostTechnology companies say they will use the Internet of Things to improve our energy usage, health, security, and lifestyle and habits. In reality, companies such as Apple and Google want to learn all they can about us so that they can market more products and services to us -- and sell our data to others.Academic, Researcher, Writer, EntrepreneurForget dreary winter landscapes -- these vibrant places around the world are guaranteed to brighten your day.CondeNastTraveler.comRobert in Wisconsin called and talked about how he came home to find his sisters waiting for him. They then told him a story about their deceased father that had listeners -- and all of us in the studio -- tearing up and realizing how much this decision meant to so many people, far beyond the rights and benefits of marriage. Listen in.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostAmericans, in their attempts to invigorate the dying art of birthing and breastfeeding, seem almost to police new mothers with each decision they make.British American author and journalistAmerica\u0027s long-term blueprint for advancing national interests is in total disarray. Some blame this indecisiveness on a lack of resolve at the White House, but the real reason lies deeper. It lurks in a disagreement among foreign policy elites over whether Russia or China constitutes America\u0027s principal great-power adversary.Author and Professor of Peace and World-Security Studies, Hampshire CollegeNewsome\u0027s action was a reminder to abandon the comfort and relative safety of insipid discontent. If we want more, we have to demand more.Managing Director for Communications, Advancement ProjectResponses to the flag controversy, and the new constitutional right to same-sex marriage and upholding Obamacare are dividing the GOP family.Senior Fellow, DemosFor many women-domestic workers as well as office workers-coming under the overtime provisions will mean that they will actually have more time for their families and other pursuits --but if they are indeed forced to work long hours, at least they will be paid for it.President, American Constitution Society for Law and PolicyAs most people know, economists are good at rewriting history. We have seen this in the last few years as the collapse of the housing bubble and the ensuing downturn has been turned into one of those unavoidable tragedies that could not have been prevented.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Asteroids can help us understand our cosmic neighborhood, are great mineral deposits, but also present potential risks for humanity. We require more investment in telescopes, research and technologies to keep us safe.Postdoctoral researcher in astrophysics at UC RiversideTurns out there are a few. Hoooraaaaay.The coolest stuff that money can buy, and more.Sometimes, doctors know exactly what we need. Sometimes they don\u0027t. Either way, only go to a doctor who sees you as a valuable partner in your child\u0027s health and progress.Momma to two boys, wife to a funny guy, speaker, and blogger about all the crazy beauty life brings.Many Muslims have taken to social media to express their horror that ISIS is trying to portray Ramadan as a month for jihadist attacks, when it is traditionally a month of celebrating peace.Managing Director, QuilliamWe\u0027re creating a culture of self-comparison that did not previously exist. Not only that, but we compare ourselves to false images, just as altered as the airbrushed models.Writer, Marketing Co-op, and College Student.I\u0027m particularly proud of a blended learning program of conscious business for our employees. Conscious Business has helped LinkedIn people communicate, collaborate, and coordinate more effectively in their professional and personal lives.Founder and Chairman, Conscious Business Center InternationalTsipras is what all leaders should actually be like. We have simply become so accustomed to seeing things through the warped prism of political expedience, that democracy as it should be appears twisted.Greek-born, Alex Andreou is a lawyer-turned-economist-turned-actor-turned-political blogger and consequently disorientedGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
