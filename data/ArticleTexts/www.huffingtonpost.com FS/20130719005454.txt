{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributor\"With unemployment still high and declining only gradually, and with inflation running below the Committee\u0027s longer-run objective, a highly accommodative monetary policy will remain appropriate for the foreseeable future.\" That\u0027s Fed chair Ben Bernanke speaking to the House about Fed policy and the economy. Among his key points were: The economy is getting better, but the labor market is lagging well behind and still needs support. He, for one, will keep supporting it until it\u0027s clear that pulling back is warranted. Congress is one of the main reasons why the Fed must continue its accommodations. He mentioned \"fiscal headwinds\" numerous times. In fact, his first sentence after \"hello\" was this: \"The economic recovery has continued at a moderate pace in recent quarters despite the strong headwinds created by federal fiscal policy.\" That\u0027s like if your neighbor invited you over for a drink and after saying \"hi\" you pointed out that their neglect of their yard was lowering the neighborhood\u0027s home values.Comments (250)David ViennaScreenwriter, playwright and author of TheDaddyComplex.comYes, using the CTFD method, you\u0027ll find the pressure lifted and realize your child loves you no matter what, even if they\u0027ve yet to master the alphabet. You\u0027ll also learn that whether or not you\u0027re the best parent in the world, as long as you love your child, they\u0027ll think you are and that\u0027s what matters.Comments (414)Peter DreierE.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeIn almost every part of the country, entire neighborhoods -- and in some cases, whole cities -- are underwater. They are not victims of natural disasters like Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy. They are drowning in debt, victims of Wall Street\u0027s reckless and predatory lending practices.Comments (423)Tim FerrissAuthor, \u0027The 4-Hour Workweek\u0027This post will explain exactly how Briana, a mother of three and reader of my blog, lost 100 pounds. It\u0027s a lot simpler than you might think.Comments (216)Dan DuffyFilmmaker; Co-founder, The Half FundI want to share a few thoughts with those of us who are either friends or loved ones of cancer patients or caregivers. We know that you love us, and want to comfort us, and we love and adore you for it. With that said, we will tear you a new one for saying any of the following platitudes.Comments (313)Matthew BerrySenior Fantasy Analyst, ESPN(*By any means necessary)Comments (24)Kristi York WootenFounder of SustenanceGroup.org, Music/Art Critic, Advocate for Women\u0027s RightsNelson Mandela, whose July 18th birthday is known and celebrated worldwide as Mandela Day, is hugely influential and inspirational to musicians, who\u0027ve found it easy to wrap poetry and melodies around the leader\u0027s tragic and triumphant life since.CommentsAdam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; founder of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911The likelihood that you will be exposed to a phishing scam at some point is relatively high.

These choices and our decision to choose can bring about the type of evolution that human beings are uniquely capable of enacting.Comments (15)Amanda DubermanAssociate Blog Editor, The Huffington PostOrange Is the New Black confronts every layer of women\u0027s experience in an environment designed for inertia -- and gets many of them right.CommentsElizabeth FishelAuthorSummer wedding bells may be ringing, but today\u0027s young people are getting to the altar years later than their parents did. But these days when a wedding finally happens, it has turned into a bigger deal than ever before.CommentsBarry LevinsonAcademy Award-winning director, screenwriter and producerThere are a number of television shows that have used the \"ripped from today\u0027s headlines\" concept, but if this trial\u0027s story points were to be adapted into a piece of fiction, it would cause certain problems in credibility in the writers\u0027 room.Comments (1,365)Peter Z. ScheerManaging Editor, TruthDig.comAmerica\u0027s apparent outrage over the Rolling Stone cover featuring a photo of accused Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev reveals a great deal about this country\u0027s insecurities and prejudices.CommentsLisa FirestonePsychology expert on relationships, parenting, self-destructive thoughts and suicide; author, \u0027Conquer Your Critical Voice\u0027Any people decide to call it quits after months or even years of emotional estrangement and physical distance. Then, why is it that couples who rarely show affection or who barely relate often feel panicked at the loss of their partner?Comments (26)Conrad BlackAuthor and HistorianWhen Stephen Nodine threw his hat in the ring for an Alabama congressional seat, the state\u0027s Republican Party chairman unctuously announced that the party would not give its imprimatur to a candidate who had been convicted of a crime. Is this self-righteous idiot of a chairman the real face of the party of Lincoln? Those tens of millions who have been wronged by the U.S. justice system -- and almost all of them have, because even the guilty are grossly over-sentenced -- should assert the traditional American right to redress, like African-Americans, women, gays, and all ethnic groups as their numbers enabled them, have done.CommentsRebecca SolnitAuthor, \u0027A Paradise Built in Hell\u0027What is terrifying to the politicians at the top is that you may be our truest patriot at the moment. \"This country is worth dying for,\" you said in explanation of your great risks.Comments (96)Jade SimmonsConcert Pianist, Arts MavenWhat will we do with you?

So how do I shelter you from a fate sealed by ignorant misunderstanding and prejudiced overreaction?Comments (179)Richard Ben-VenisteLitigatorIt is now apparent that a national debate focused on an exposition of accurate facts concerning the scope of data vacuumed up by NSA and the checks and oversight -- both internally within the executive branch as well as by Congress and the judiciary -- is warranted.CommentsMohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOHaving succeeded in temporarily restoring calm to the markets after the May/June upheavals, Mr. Bernanke still faces the more difficult challenge of regaining policy flexibility for an institution that is central to the well-being of the U.S. and that of the global economy.Comments (106)Layla DemayFrench journalist, author and documentary film directorFrom selling concerts tickets to launching human rights campaigns, the boob has never been so present, powerful, pregnant and perky in our society. For better of for worse, 2013 will be remembered as the Year of The Boobs.Comments (307)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Almost everyone knows CEO pay is out of control. What\u0027s less well-known is that you and I and other taxpayers are subsidizing this sky-high executive compensation.Comments (1,037)Maureen RyanTV critic, The Huffington PostWith the eleventh episode, \"Orange Is the New Black\" took a great leap forward. I think I underestimated the show\u0027s ambitions.Comments (53)Robert L. BorosagePresident, Institute for America\u0027s FutureIn his congressional testimony yesterday, Fed Chair Ben Bernanke called out the Congress.

BissonnetteCo-founder and Executive Director of Roots of DevelopmentHappy Birthday President Mandela, and thank you for giving me the opportunity to once again reflect on the significance of dignity.CommentsSimon RosenbergPresident, NDNContrary to recent news accounts, we are closer to passing a meaningful immigration reform bill than at any point since John McCain and Ted Kennedy introduced their bill in 2005.Comments (13)Jack MirkinsonMedia Editor, The Huffington PostWhat, precisely, was Rolling Stone supposed to do? Never put anybody bad on its cover? What kind of respect does it show readers to shield them in that way?Comments (101)Raymond J. LearsyAuthor, \u0027Oil and Finance: The Epic Corruption Continues\u0027What, pray tell, is a bank doing in the oil, gas, power and electricity business? Is that why we have a Federal Reserve -- to fund their gambling addiction? Should the bank fail because of its gambling excess, we would be left holding the bill and mopping up the mess of Too Big to Fail.Comments (35)William Bradley, 2013.18.07Quora, 2013.18.07Adam Hanft, 2013.18.07John Dear, 2013.18.07Rev.
