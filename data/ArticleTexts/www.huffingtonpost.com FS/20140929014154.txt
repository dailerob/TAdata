{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week brought some notable farewells. First, Charlo Greene, a 26-year-old TV reporter in Alaska, won the Internet when she dropped the f-bomb on air and quit her job to work full-time on marijuana reform (she pulled off a rare viral double play when, during an interview on HuffPost Live, she smoked a joint). Making a less theatrical but far more significant exit, Eric Holder announced he is resigning as Attorney General. Of course, Holder has agreed to remain in his post until his successor is confirmed by the Senate -- so, given the current state of D.C. dysfunction, he may be AG for some time to come. Finally, after a series of violent nightmares, the sports world delivered a fairy-tale ending as Derek Jeter capped his legendary career with a storybook walk-off hit in his last game at Yankee Stadium.

One is in Paris. It\u0027s filled with movie theaters, boutiques, markets, and fantastic restaurants. Two months ago, I found myself walking down the other Champs-Élysées, nicknamed by aid workers, in the middle of the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan.Film ProducerA good deal of the growing lack of confidence in the Supreme Court these days is due precisely to the concern that the justices are increasingly voting in ways that reflect the political values and preferences of the presidents who appointed them.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoWomen must be heard. Their voices and ideas can greatly contribute to finding climate solutions that work locally and culturally.Fashion model, actress, goodwill ambassador for the UN Environment ProgrammeThis is an emergency of enormous scale, and we all have a moral obligation to stand shoulder to shoulder to ensure its swift conclusion.

Despite following the rules, many of my clients couldn\u0027t ditch that stubborn weight. I knew these people weren\u0027t cheating, so I began to wonder why those rules weren\u0027t working.Fitness/Nutrition Expert, Author of NY Times Bestseller The Virgin Diet.Nothing better illustrates the bankruptcy of the Obama administration\u0027s foreign policy than funding groups that turn on the U.S. again and again, a neo-con fueled cycle of profits for war makers and destruction of ever-shifting \"enemies.\"Former 16-year member of the U.S. Congress and two-time U.S. presidential candidateTaking accountability for yourself and your work means accepting the good along with the bad. If you own up to your mistakes, why shouldn\u0027t you own up to your victories? Here\u0027s how to start getting over the fear of healthy self-promotion.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarWe truly can save the oceans and feed the world by eating more of the right types of fish and fighting for better fishery management.

Located in Bong County in the rural heart of Liberia, Phebe was known as one of the best hospitals in the country.Assistant Professor of Emergency Medicine, Brown Medical SchoolA person with an opinion and a way to project it is a powerful thing, whether that platform is Twitter or the floor of the UN. But women know that when they choose to voice such an opinion, they open themselves up to the possibility of not just vehement disagreement or critique, but violence, sexualization and threats which may or may not be empty.Senior Editor, HuffPost WomenThose of us in the academy should be asking ourselves what more can we do to confront one of the most urgent and consequential challenges facing our civilization.President, Harvard UniversityPresident, Stanford UniversityIf 150,000 U.S. troops could not stabilize Iraq in the absence of an inclusive and competent government, the limited measures on offer now simply will not suffice. And we should know by now that any Western military intervention with overtly political, rather than clearly humanitarian, objectives runs a real risk of inflaming sectarian sentiment.President Intl. Crisis Group (2000-2009), Australian Foreign Minister (1988-1996)In California, we have emphasized in recent years building standards and appliance standards and a renewable energy goal. But now instead of just asking how many solar installations we have or how many wind installations or geothermal, we are putting the emphasis on our climate footprint.Governor of CaliforniaI firmly believe that if we started owning up to taking nude photos of ourselves, there would be a lot less stigma surrounding having and sharing them... and if we stopped thinking of nudity and sex as our enemies, we\u0027d have a healthier, happier society.Executive Editor, HuffPost Gay VoicesSome exercises may not deliver the results you\u0027d expect, and others could actually hurt you.
