This point was made beautifully clear by Professor -- excuse me, Justice -- Elena Kagan, who did us all the favor of coming up with a well-polished hypothetical posed to the able Michael Carvin, attorney for the petitioners, that demonstrated the fallacy of this latest right-wing hit on the ACA. Kagan\u0027s hypothetical case (imagine a world without hypotheticals!) made the point that all text has context, and that specific instructions need to be read as part of an overall program and direction.

They might get the mistaken impression that voters don\u0027t care.Executive Director, Presidential Climate Action ProjectOut Of Line: The UninvitedCartoonist and AuthorA diagnosis will bring out the best and worst of you and your partner.
