{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Cooney\u0027s doctoring of global warming documents.AriannaWith memos pouring out of the U.K. showing there was no planning for what to do after Baghdad fell and that \"intelligence and facts were being fixed\"; with the number of dead American soldiers now over 1,700; and with nearly 60 percent of Americans turning against the war, what is the Democratic leadership waiting for before they finally stand up to the White House? While Democrats are criss-crossing the country, holding conclaves in search of what the party should stand for, Russ Feingold will introduce a resolution in the Senate today calling on the President to create a timetable for withdrawing American troops from Iraq. Thank God at least one prominent Dem has the good sense to know what the party should stand for -- and, just as importantly, the cojones to act on that knowledge.There is talk that recruitment shortfalls will lead to a reinstatement of a military draft. It would be far better for the health of our Army to institute a draft for an opposition party. Right now, it seems, there aren\u0027t enough willing to serve voluntarily.Read More06.14.2005 Walter CronkiteI am joining the hundreds of thousands who shall be marching in the Virtual March on Washington to Stop Global Warming in order to demonstrate the concern that we all hold for the future of our planet and all the living things -- flora, fauna, human and animal -- that exist upon it. I want to be in that parade and if there is a place up front I\u0027d wish to lead the band or at least be assigned a big bass drum to help pound out the rhythm of glorious success.read whole post | permalink06.14.2005 Alan PatricofIt’s not going to be a simple process but Olmert reinforced the statement that Israel will definitely begin moving people out of Gaza on August 15th and it will be completed in its entirety by September 15th. The result of this agenda has been to create the most serious internal crisis in Israel since 1948 and it is going to be very painful to carry out and will only take place with great fear and hesitation but it is inevitable in order to create a new relationship between Israel and the Palestinian authority...read whole post | permalink | comments06.14.2005 Jesse KornbluthIt\u0027s my view that we\u0027re experiencing not one, but two bubbles: Real Estate and God. Like the Real Estate Bubble, the God Bubble has been getting so much attention that we\u0027ve been encouraged to think it\u0027s real and growing: a bedrock change in American culture. And no doubt there are many who do place their faith above all else and are delighted that their religion is -- at last -- big news. But as in any movement, there are people who join a cause just because it looks like a winner.read whole post | permalink | comments06.14.2005 Karen FinleyLet me tell you the real reason the Olympic stadium didn’t go through. It’s pay back time. New York City is sick and tired of having the party in their house, providing the booze, food, the space and then everyone putting their cigarettes out on our rug. After last summer’s hosting of the Republican Convention, (even though 75 percent of Manhattan voted for Kerry) New Yorkers have had enough.read whole post | permalink | comments06.14.2005 Paul KrassnerIn the midst of all the news and views today about the Michael Jackson verdict, there appears a full-page ad by the 99-cents-only stores, with this headline: “NOT GUILTY!--of charging more than 99 cents.” Presumably, if the jury had gone the other way, the ad would have stated: “GUILTY! -- of never charging more than 99 cents.”permalink | comments06.13.2005 Harry ShearerIt would seem sexy enough, journalistically, that the father of Freedom Fries turned against the war that spawned his original fame. Yet it took an appearance on the least-watched Sunday news yakfest to light the story\u0027s fire. Could it be that our major papers now don\u0027t believe it if they don\u0027t see it on TV?read whole post | permalink | comments06.13.2005 Rep. John ConyersIn all of my years in Congress, I have never seen a phenomenon develop and grow like the controversy over these now infamous minutes, and the related corroboration. Amazingly, more than 540,000 Americans have joined with me in signing a letter to the President demanding answers and accountability. You can sign (and your friends, colleagues and family) by simply going to my web site and clicking the letter and filling out the information...read whole post | permalink | comments06.14.2005 Noah HelpernMorris: The role that McNamara played in American history is, to me, just endlessly fascinating. And what makes it even more disturbing is not that he was an evil man, or a man with bad intentions who did evil things, but that he was a man with good intentions who did evil things.read whole post | permalink | comments06.14.2005 Nelson GeorgeA little over twenty years after the triumph of Thriller and now approaching middle age, Michael Jackson looks nothing like the little boy I admired. His skin is pale and chalky. He wears bizarre outfits. Although Jackson won’t go to jail for any of the 10 counts of child molestation or child endangerment he was on trial for, his life and career will remain tainted. His fascination with young boys – young white boys – is still disquieting. The details of his personal life unearthed during the trial will shadow him for the rest of his life.read whole post | permalink | comments06.13.2005 David CornAs the news side of the HuffPost noted, I had something of a scoop with an article reporting that FBI documents show that when Mark Felt (aka Deep Throat) was leaking to Woodward and Bernstein during Watergate he was also in charge of trying to find out who in the FBI was leaking to Woodward and Bernstein. (Click here to read the whole piece.) In the course of writing this article, I came across several delicious nuggets...read whole post | permalink | comments06.13.2005 Trey EllisIt was sort of exciting television watching the verdict come in on CNN. Watching the Jackson convoy roll in from Neverland, the helicopter camera crews chronicling every lane change and stop sign, forced comparisons with OJ’s white Bronco. Yet by now, after O.J., Martha Stewart and Robert Blake, these high-profile trials have all the luster of season five of Survivor. The thrill was in the first season, now they are just more feed for the insatiable maw of my TiVo. Still, as long as we’re here, what can we learn from all this?read whole post | permalink | comments06.13.2005 David SirotaThe GOP may try to make it seem as if any new initiatives on Iraq mean Democrats are just responding to polls. But, whatever - I\u0027ll take it. Hell, I\u0027ll take anything if it means more Democrats will stand up and give voice to the majority of Americans who want to see our Iraq policy seriously altered.read whole post | permalink06.13.2005 Paul FeigIs there anything stranger than seeing people jumping around and throwing confetti and hugging because Michael Jackson was acquitted of child molestation charges? No matter what one\u0027s thoughts about the verdicts were, there is something profoundly bizarre about people acting like the guy just threw the winning touchdown in the Super Bowl.read whole post | permalink | comments06.13.2005 Bruce CohenOf the hundreds of works I see by artists from 70 different countries, it feels like hardly any of it is two-dimensional paintings hanging on walls. Instead, I am met with a mind-expanding array of non-traditional sculptures, video pieces, performance art, site-specific installations and audience participation experiments. The art is falling and pouring off of the walls, completely blurring the lines between artist and audience, reality and fantasy (or, more appropriately these days, reality and scripted), art and life...read whole post | permalink | comments06.13.2005 Doug HellerAlthough his live announcement was bumped off the evening news to cover MJ, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger did indeed announce that Californians will go to the polls this November to vote on a series of initaitives that Schwarzenegger has been touting on behalf of big business. Knowing that Arnold\u0027s extra election is a self-serving waste of taxpayer money (there is another perfectly good and already budgeted election scheduled for next June), most Californians oppose Arnold on this one.read whole post | permalink06.13.2005 Max BlumenthalCable news can\u0027t get enough of Natalee Holloway. She\u0027s young, pretty, white, and missing -- the perfect human interest story. Geraldo Rivera gets spirited down to Aruba to sip daquiris and follow leads that don\u0027t exist. Meanwhile, there are hundreds of important stories that could have been told instead of, or in addition to, Holloway\u0027s. Some of them even involve missing women whose disappearances are actually part of a widespread kidnapping epidemic...read whole post | permalink06.13.2005 Carl PopeWell, things have heated up since the New York Times belatedly reported that Council on Environmental Quality staffer Phil Cooney, former lobbyist for the oil industry, had been censoring government science on global warming....although Cooney\u0027s role has been on the public record for two years, the media only just now decided it was newsworthy. I asked a former Times reporter last week how this happened, and he suggested that most likely the reporter had tried to get the story into the paper when it originally came up, but that the editors had squashed it and then later decided they had been wrong.read whole post | permalink | comments06.13.2005 Lyn Davis LearAfter checking with friends at the network, I’m very relieved to learn that the rumor that CBS had bowed to Vatican demands that no Jewish or gay people be allowed to work on the new special on the life of the Pope is absolutely untrue. In fact, I’m told there are gay people and Jewish people already working on the project. It’s sad that we live in a time where bigotry and pressure-group power is so prevalent that a story such as this one seems believable… and very good news that it turns out, as I had hoped, not to be true.read whole post | permalink06.13.2005 Mark JosephCrime is on the increase in Japan and not just any old crimes, but those of the weird and sadistic variety. At lunch with longtime friends they tell me that the country has changed radically as crimes have become random, purposeless and inexplicable. A few days later I see the story of a family of three who are awakened at 1 in the morning by a 20-year old man frantically knocking on their door. When they open it, he attacks them with a baseball bat and then drives off. None of the victims have any idea who he is.read whole post | permalink","h1":"",".title":"","h2":"Exxon New Home For Bush Global Warming Expert ...On The Blog NowGlobal Warming: Why I Am MarchingChange in Israel; Cherie Blair in U.S.If the Real Estate Bubble Bursts, is the God Bubble Next?Not In Our Town, The Olympic StadiumAnd Another ThingParlez-vous 180?Downing Street Minutes Controversy Growing -- What You Can Do To HelpThe HuffPost Interview: Errol MorrisMichael Jackson: Letters from a Cold IslandAll the President\u0027s DummiesThe King of PopFinally, More Democrats Taking a Stand on IraqI wish I could get that excited about stuff ...Greetings from the Venice Biennale-- Art is everywhere.
