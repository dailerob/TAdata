{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorIt\u0027s shocking to me that the Mitt Romney campaign is now lurching around, daily trotting out new \"studies\" and \"solutions\" to their tax plan\u0027s math problem -- \"we\u0027ll broaden the base (but can\u0027t say how)\"... \"we\u0027ll cap deductions at $17,000\"... \"whoops... that doesn\u0027t work... we\u0027ll cap them at $25,000.\" The Romney team clearly threw out their tax plan -- 20 percent cuts across the board -- without any of the requisite spade work to see if it actually made sense. And now that real studies are challenging it, they\u0027re veering from \"just trust us\" to setting the evidentiary bar down so low that anything with numbers on it can clear it. Not surprising, given the beating the facts have taken in this election cycle, but not so good for democracy, not to mention the truth.Read Post | Comments (90)Robert Reich, 10/18/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027President Obama should propose that the nation\u0027s biggest banks be broken up and their size capped, and that the Glass-Steagall Act be resurrected. It\u0027s good policy, and it would smoke out Mitt Romney as being of, by, and for Wall Street -- and not on the side of average Americans.Read Post | Comments (491)Robert Redford, 10/19/12Actor, director, and environmental activistWe simply can\u0027t let Mitt Romney buy the keys to the White House and let the special interests write our nation\u0027s energy plan behind closed doors. He\u0027d roll back every step of progress we\u0027ve made -- not just in the last four years, but the last 40 years.Read Post | Comments (1,152)Jessica S.

Colonel, Air ForceBoth Obama and Romney prefer to praise the troops rather than address the tragic consequences of continuing military action in Afghanistan and elsewhere. The latter, when they\u0027re addressed at all, are reduced to sound bites and homilies about the need to \"stay the course\" and \"support our troops.\"Read Post | Comments (16)Ransom Riggs, 10/18/12Author, Miss Peregrine\u0027s Home for Peculiar ChildrenWhat interested me about the photos -- even more than the images themselves, at first -- was that they were available for sale at all.

Talbott, 10/19/12Author, \"Survival Investing: How to Prosper Amid Thieving Banks and Corrupt Governments\"I believe the entire field of financial advice is badly broken and encourages lying.
