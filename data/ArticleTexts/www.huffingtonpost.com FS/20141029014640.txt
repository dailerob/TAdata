Some Democrats have it, but the disorder seems especially widespread among Republicans.These politicians have no idea what people who are hard up in America are going through. Most Americans aren\u0027t suicidal, and most don\u0027t work at the minimum wage. But many are deeply anxious about their jobs and panicked about how they\u0027re going to pay next month\u0027s bills. Almost two-thirds of working Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. And they\u0027re worried sick about whether their kids will ever make it. They need leaders who understand their plight instead of denying it.I’m very excited to announce that the journey we started over a year ago in Tunisia and continued this May in Algeria has now added the final missing part -- HuffPost Morocco -- to create the full ensemble of The Huffington Post Maghreb!I’m a new widow, so sometimes I’m oblivious.

The real objection to Zellweger\u0027s new face isn\u0027t that she has one. The objection is that we can\u0027t pretend it didn\u0027t happen.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarThis oil spill is not an isolated case -- it\u0027s just one example of persistent and pervasive environmental misconduct that endangers the environment and the people that depend upon it.Actor; board member, OceanaActor; board member, OceanaWednesday is Ben Bradlee\u0027s funeral in Washington. At a time when we reflect back, here are a few Bradlee qualities that I will try to remember (and replicate) going forward.President of Junction Investments and a former political producer for Katie Couric at CBS NewsA new generation of young workers (The Net Generation as I\u0027ve called them) is entering the workforce and bringing a new culture.

The question is: Will their political circumstances and the reality they face lead to such an outcome?Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUThere is no single fix that can make our region more resilient in the face of climate change. But by working in our communities and at the national level, we can defuse this threat.

This is unacceptable, and we as a nation must do better.U.S. Representative, California\u0027s 6th Congressional DistrictAre you the default parent? If you have to think about it, you\u0027re not. You\u0027d know. Trust me. The default parent is the one responsible for the emotional, physical and logistical needs of the children. Spoiler alert: It\u0027s typically the one with the uterus.Writer. Blogger. Recovering Nail Biter. Humorist. Wearer of Funny Hats. Moon Lover.Does it matter that the wealthy turnout to vote at a rate of almost 99% while those making below $10,000 vote at a rate of 49%? It sure seems like it would, but for a long time many political scientists and journalists believed it didn\u0027t.WriterI was wondering yesterday why I haven\u0027t made a donation to fighting Ebola. It seems I am not the only one. Americans tend to give generously when disaster strikes, but we\u0027ve been slow to donate to organizations battling this disease.Writer, editor, and believer in women creating change.Publicized school shootings are not the only ones creating holes in families and communities.

I wish I could go, go somewhere in that tragedy burdened West African region to do something, ANYTHING.Human rights advocate, journalist and lecturerOne of the major reasons for the polarization between the two sides in the gun violence debate is that one side, the NRA side, refuses to admit that suicide has anything to do with gun violence at all.Mike the Gun GuyDoes this mean some criminals will be able to hide from the cops? Yes. Yes, it will. But it will also mean that cops can\u0027t just root around in your data and trample any citizen\u0027s rights for no reason -- which is precisely what the Constitution intended.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comGrab your ghost-busting gear: Drinks come with spook back at these long-haunted American bars.Liquor.comWith awareness, more affordable screenings, better quality of care, and new research and development, we can save millions of women\u0027s lives.Secretary of Health \u0026 Human Services (HHS)Given the \"loaded nature\" of the objects and the situation, there are certainly ways to capture a scene like this that is not only more sensitive (and more mundane), but steers clear of exploitive associations to race and violence.Publisher of the visual politics and media literacy site, BagNewsNotesYusuf, let\u0027s talk about your new album Tell \u0027Em I\u0027m Gone.
