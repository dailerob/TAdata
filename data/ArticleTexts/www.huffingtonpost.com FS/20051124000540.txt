{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"From wikipedia.orgWhat was Sam Tanenhaus, the editor of the New York Times Book Review, thinking when he assigned Maureen Dowd’s new book to Kathryn Harrison -- the author of a book about her sexual affair with her father whom Dowd had previously slammed as “creepy” and “vengeful”? Shouldn’t bad blood be an automatic disqualifier when farming out a book -- even if it isn’t by your paper’s star columnist? This is Journalism 101. The Times\u0027 ethical guidelines warn against “the slightest whiff of favoritism”. Well, how about the overwhelming stench of score-settling?READ POST | comments (12)11.23.2005 Nora EphronI have a fairly serious theory about Thanksgiving dinner, and it\u0027s this: don\u0027t mess with it. What most people make for Thanksgiving dinner is what their mothers made, and you stray from this at your peril.READ POST | comments (17)11.23.2005 Harry ShearerSure it\u0027s the day before Thanksgiving, but it\u0027s a little hard to forgive CNN for totally ignoring one of the day\u0027s major stories.READ POST | comments11.23.2005 Rep. Dennis KucinichThe White House is up to its old propaganda tricks again, this time to mislead Congress and the public to back the continued occupation of Iraq.READ POST | comments (11)11.23.2005 Eric AltermanIf the Bush administration says it can pick up an American citizen off the street, hold him incommunicado, refuse him the right to a trial and refuse to explain what the nature of his crime is, I think this pretty much makes the United States Constitution inoperative.READ POST | comments11.23.2005 Rep. John MurthaThe American people are ahead of Congress in recognizing that we must give the Iraqis incentive to step up and seize their own destiny so that our young men and women in uniform will not continue paying such a heavy price for an indefinite period.READ POST | comments (325)11.23.2005 Robert ScheerYou\u0027ve got to hand it to Dick Cheney; no other modern politician has come so close to perfecting the theater of the absurd. Even as he protests his innocence of lying about matters of state, he lies about matters of state.READ POST | comments (86)11.17.2005 Arianna HuffingtonI\u0027ll collect the names and hand deliver them to Mr. O\u0027Reilly.READ POST | comments (258)11.23.2005 RJ EskowStep right up and count the war crimes you\u0027re paying for with every deduction. Torture? Check. Murder of civilians with incendiary devices? Check. Illegal detentions of non-combatants? Check.READ POST | comments (15)11.23.2005 Ron GallowayI think Wal-Mart believes that by doing their best to fulfill their responsibilities, the need to defend their success should be an afterthought. In today\u0027s world, it\u0027s not.READ POST | comments (46)11.23.2005 David WallechinskyGeorge Bush\u0027s ill-advised attempt to outdo his father led to the deaths of thousands of Americans and tens of thousands of Iraqis, the loss of U.S. credibility and the creation in Iraq of a terrorist training ground.READ POST | comments (51)11.22.2005 Hooman MajdIt\u0027s hard to argue with the Bush administration\u0027s call for democracy in the Middle East. The problem isn\u0027t the policy, the problem is that it isn\u0027t sincere.READ POST | comments (15)11.22.2005 Jeremy PikserLater, off the record, Cheney said it is \"an international crime\" to say that an unprovoked invasion of a sovereign state is an international crime and that it is \"torture\" to claim that US forces and intelligence agencies engage in torture.READ POST | comments (22)11.22.2005 Flavia ColganWhile others spouted political half-measures out of a fear of being branded cowards, Murtha spoke tough and true because he\u0027d spent a lifetime confirming he was brave.READ POST | comments (35)11.22.2005 Aaron FreemanI understand the ability to torture without US backup is an important part of Iraq\u0027s transformation to a Chicago-style democracy. Up in Ninevah province they apparently mastered Chicago-esque ballot box stuffing.READ POST | comments11.22.2005 Cenk UygurNow that the government has changed their story for the third time on why Padilla is so dangerous, there is no other conclusion left to draw -- they\u0027re making it up.READ POST | comments (64)11.22.2005 Jane HamsherWoodward seems to believe that whatever price he paid for access to an otherwise impenetrable administration has been worth it, with no notion that he has turned into a complete tool.READ POST | comments (23)11.22.2005 Jeff CohenProgressive members of Congress have been listening to their constituents, and speaking out loudly and bravely to end the destabilizing US occupation of Iraq. It\u0027s Hillary who isn\u0027t listening.READ POST | comments (66)11.22.2005 Jeremy ScahillIf reports circulating in the British press on Tuesday turn out to be true, there could be another smoking gun memo floating around across the Atlantic.READ POST | comments (15)11.22.2005 Marty KaplanThe challenge now for Democrats is how to maintain the sharp edge of opposition while affirming people’s yearning for common ground. Fights are fine, as long as their goal is unity.READ POST | comments (14)11.22.2005 Jerry and Joe LongA source close to the VP stated “it’s been pretty well verified” the turkey had access to various biological and chemical substances, including what has been termed by a Pentagon informant as “a potential basting agent”.READ POST | comments (13)AP/Ron EdmondsFrom The NY ObserverFrom telegraph.co.ukAPAP/Sujit MahatFrom news.aol.comLogin to Huffington Post  |  Make Huff Post your Home Page  |  RSS/XML  |  Sitemap  |  Advertising  |  JobsCopyright 2005 © HuffingtonPost.com, LLC   |  User Agreement  |  Privacy  |  Comment Policy  |  Powered by MovableType","h1":"Congressman Murtha Blogs...",".title":"","h2":"Why the New York Times Owes Maureen Dowd an ApologyBait and Switch?
