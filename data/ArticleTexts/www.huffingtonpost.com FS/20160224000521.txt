{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Climatologist and Adjunct Professor, Columbia University Earth InstituteThe commercials are low-key, but omnipresent. Gentle, warm encouragement, the key message only implicit: vote for the political candidates on the take from the fossil fuel industry. \"I am an energy voter\" commercials are from skilled professionals and they are persuasive. They promise jobs, low prices at the pump, warm homes, and energy independence for our nation. Benefits for all, or so it seems. In reality, in the end, benefits flow mainly to a handful of people, the fossil fuel magnates, who prefer to be anonymous. \"I am an energy voter\" commercials, in effect, ask us to place our offspring on a sacrificial alter. As we raise the knife, unlike Abraham, we hear no voice telling us to stop, to put down the knife. Young people do not cry out. Adults are fooled and compliant. Yet the science is crystal clear. We have a climate and energy crisis, an emergency.If law enforcement is required to show probable cause to a judge that a crime has been committed or is being planned in order to execute a search, that burden -- not warrant-proof encryption -- is the strongest protection of our privacy from state intrusion.United States Senator (Ret.)Manhattan District AttorneyThis year, between April 19 and 21, the United Nations General Assembly will hold a special session on drugs and the world will have a chance to change course. As we approach that event, we need to ask ourselves if we are on the right policy path.Chair of the Kofi Annan Foundation and The Elders; Secretary-General of the United Nations from January 1997 to December 2006What\u0027s the answer to our obesity crisis? Well, I have to admit we don\u0027t know. But we at HuffPost Australia are going to spend this year looking for as many answers as we can find. Small ideas. Big ideas. Ideas that are already making a difference.Editor-in-Chief, HuffPost AustraliaPresident Trump said he was \"just fooling around\" this morning when he placed two pieces of bacon -- a forbidden food in the Muslim religion -- between the pages of the Quran at the annual National Prayer Breakfast. The action instantly provoked a crisis that threatens to plunge the world into Armageddon.Paul Slansky is amassing a memory for Americans allergic to accountability and addicted to amnesia.Once I removed the dogmatic lens that had informed my biblical interpretations, I found a figure that defended a prostitute and ate with the poor. The life of Jesus simply didn\u0027t reflect the agenda of the political right, so now neither could I.PhD in Religious Studies, Host of The Brain Candy PodcastA very similar trickle-down agenda worked badly for Romney/Ryan, allowing the opposition to portray their candidacy as out-of-touch plutocrats, unconcerned about middle-class income stagnation and inequality.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorWhen it comes to people of color, the police make San Francisco \"Baghdad by the Bay.\"Author, \u0027Mainstreaming Torture\u0027Senator Sanders, I like you. I admire you. Most of the time, I wish that we had 99 more senators just like you. And I would, wouldn\u0027t I? I\u0027m the kind of voter that you should have a lock on. But Senator, we have a problem, and it\u0027s a big one.Writer, layabout and all-around nogoodnik; web publisher; former Associate News Editor, The Huffington PostLast Thursday, I woke up, put on my favorite suit and brought the voices, stories, and demands of ColorOfChange members to the President of the United States of America.Executive Director, ColorOfChangeI understand people\u0027s instinct to stand by others in their community, but the anger and protests in support of Officer Peter Liang are misplaced. The only time I\u0027d ever seen such a large rally of Asian Americans was in footage of my uncle Vincent Chin\u0027s case.Special education teacher, pro-public schools, activist, proud CTU member, AAPI, educolor, #resistTFADays after winning in Nevada, I asked Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton why she believes women writ large are not rallying around her. In the clip here, she explains how she\u0027ll win their votes and utilize her campaign as a platform to break down racial and gender barriers.PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorHe may have wonderful progressive ideas, but Hillary is a policy wonk. She understands the need for compromise, which means the need for imperfection.Author; Resident Scholar, Women\u0027s Studies Research Center, Brandeis UniversityKalamazoo is a vibrant, cool city with a creative community, a promise of college to our youth, and neighbors who support one another. Kalamazoo is not -- and will never be -- synonymous with senseless violence.Writer and lifelong resident of Kalamazoo, Michigan.The establishment doesn\u0027t see what\u0027s happening because it has cut itself off from the lives of most Americans. It also doesn\u0027t wish to understand, because that would mean acknowledging its role in bringing all this on. Yet regardless of the political fates of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, the rebellion against the establishment will continue.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027Ending the occupation is not a charitable gift to the Palestinians. Only by accepting their right to a state of their own will Israel remain a Jewish and democratic state enjoying peace and security, instead of being drawn toward an abyss from which there is no salvation.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUIt\u0027s time to shift the conversation from the rages of displacement towards the work of removing institutional barriers to space and capital, and expanding access to capital and networks so that more people of all income levels can make the same choices I made to stay, return or relocate to Harlem.Founder of Urban Planning for the American City, based in New York.The \"right to privacy\" is a bedrock concept in U.S. society and a guiding principle in our legal system. But if you look for it in the U.S. Constitution or the Bill of Rights, you won\u0027t find it. That\u0027s because privacy rights aren\u0027t as clear-cut as many Americans generally think they are.Tech attorney specializing in privacy, intellectual property and licensingI became friends with Ted Kennedy in the last decade of his life. Remembering him on his birthday, I should tell you that the facts of his public life, whether difficult or uplifting, did not fully capture the man.Novelist and contributing opinion writerSorry, John. Female voters are listening carefully -- very carefully -- and women are not stupid. They know doublespeak when they hear it, and they just got an earful of it from you.Money Editor, Ms. magazine; national gender pay equity consultant, Director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsSchool staff report that children who receive new shoes through the Shoes That Fit program attend school more often with fewer behavioral problems. They participate more in physical activities and interact more with their peers. But most of all, school staff like Sandy say, the new shoes boost a child\u0027s self-esteem like almost nothing else.Executive Director of Shoes That FitWhat I only realize now, as I type these words, is that the last sounds my baby heard as she gracefully and bravely exited this world were of her mama\u0027s wild laughter. My last gift to her.

All Secretary Clinton has to do to earn my support today is this.Assistant Professor of English at University of New Hampshire; Series Co-Editor, Best American Experimental WritingNegative portrayals of Muslims in media not only fan the flames of Islamophobia, but they also reinforce feelings of alienation and humiliation in Muslims -- exactly the sentiments that motivate people to join ISIS and other extremist groups.Cultural Diplomacy Expert; Fmr. U.S. Ambassador to NetherlandsKnowing even a little of James Comey\u0027s post 9-11 background, it becomes rather hard to believe the FBI Director is sincerely leveling with the American public in his latest quest to compel Apple (and other encrypted communication companies) to create a mechanism for government access.Former FBI Special AgentI am not defending Hillary Clinton. That is something she can do for herself -- or not. What concerns me is the creation of a bogus standard, one that is unattainable in both the private and public realm, and one which ironically invites lying and misrepresentation.Best-selling author, Professor of journalism at Emerson College, Former Washington Post and Time Magazine staff writerRubio\u0027s only chance is Cruz dropping out. Cruz\u0027s only chance is Rubio dropping out. Neither man, though, is about to drop out -- and by the time one of them does, it will likely be too late to stop the Trump juggernaut.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comIn a day marked by spirited political disagreement, everyone involved came together to agree on one thing: this was not what democracy was supposed to look like.Editor in Chief, AMERICAblogI write this not to defend Killer Mike. Or Sanders\u0027 comments on Killer Mike\u0027s comments. Or Gloria Steinem\u0027s comments. Or Madeleine Albright\u0027s.
