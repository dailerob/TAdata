{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, People For the American WayYesterday, Senate Republicans voted, for a second time in two days, to continue their filibuster of the DISCLOSE Act, a bill that would simply require outside groups spending money on elections to tell the public where their money comes from. At the same time, not surprisingly, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney is in hot water for failing to disclose more than the minimum of personal tax returns and seemingly lying about his history at the company that made his fortune -- all while we know that a portion of his wealth was hidden in infamously secretive Swiss bank accounts. Senate Republicans and Romney are spending a lot of time and energy this week to keep their financial histories secret. It\u0027s only natural to ask: What do they have to hide?Read Post | Comments (157)Michelangelo Signorile, 07/18/12Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay Voices; SiriusXM radio hostThe Boy Scouts had a chance to redeem itself, but it should now be considered an enemy of civil rights and a reckless organization whose actions are furthering bullying and discrimination in AmericaRead Post | Comments (1,026)Raymond J.

Perhaps, with good discussion, a solution (or compromise of some sort) will follow, as that is what happens in the court system.Read Post | CommentsPaul Abrams, 07/18/12Last person on Earth not on FacebookI have tried to shine a light on the clearest, cleanest, unspinnable, problem with Romney\u0027s finances -- amnesty for his Swiss accounts -- suggesting that the Republican leaders, who dislike him anyhow, could not abide such a fatally-flawed nominee.Read Post | Comments (33)Barbara Hannah Grufferman, 07/18/12Author, \u0027The Best of Everything After 50\u0027 and Chief Pundit, FOFWhen women make it to the top, as Rometty and Mayer have, how much should we expect of them?

It isn\u0027t a vacation during which women eat bonbons, watch TV and hit the spa. It isn\u0027t restful, peaceful or relaxing. It\u0027s a necessary time to reorient, heal, figure things out and learn how to keep this little person you just gave birth to alive.Read Post | Comments (45)Shannon Bradley-Colleary, 07/18/12Author, screenwriter, wife dominatrix, mom butlerShe\u0027d forgotten something at home and returned sooner than expected to pick it up only to find her husband of 15 years, Frank (pronounced Franc) watching an adult film on his MacBook Air.Read Post | Comments (106)Van Jones, 07/18/12President, RebuildtheDream.com; Author of NY Times bestseller, \u0027The Green-Collar Economy\u0027Washington wisdom doesn\u0027t always account for an outside game.

It\u0027s not a law, but that doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s not a rule. There\u0027s no law that a presidential candidate has to debate, either, but that\u0027s the way we do it in America.Read Post | CommentsRobert L.
