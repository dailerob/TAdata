{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOEver since we began expanding HuffPost, people have been asking, when are you going to start covering sports? And when they asked, I could see the passion in their eyes. For fans, sports is more than just an interest -- it\u0027s an abiding fascination, occasionally slipping over into love. And obsession. It makes the heart pump and the adrenalin flow. So today, at long last, we\u0027re launching HuffPost Sports. And since sports is now about much more than the game on the field, we\u0027ll follow all the off-field action too -- whether it\u0027s a serious story about steroids or a fun look at the latest high-profile sports romance. You\u0027ll get highlights and lowlights, must-see video clips, and fresh takes from a broad array of bloggers, weighing in on anything and everything from the world of sports. So check out HuffPost Sports. And let the games begin.Read Post | Comments (108)BIOHarry Shearer, 11.11.2009Actor, author, director, satirist, musician, radio host, playwright, multi-media artistFollowing Matthew Hoh\u0027s resignation letter comes a missive from William Polk who, like Hoh, finds the only prudent course of action regarding Afghanistan to be a timely removal of troops.Read Post | Comments (34)BIORobert L.
