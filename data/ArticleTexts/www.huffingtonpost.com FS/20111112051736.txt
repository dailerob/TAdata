{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Founder of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of AmericaWith the Iraq War set to end soon and the Afghanistan War entering its second decade following the death of Osama bin Laden, this may be the biggest and most important Veterans Day ever. We must remember that new veterans are an investment for the entire country. They represent exactly what America needs right now to rebuild its economy and propel its future: leadership, resilience and a commitment to serve. They\u0027re a generation who can turn our country around -- and who can lead America into the future. The New Greatest Generation is America\u0027s future. And that\u0027s why we should invest in their potential -- not just on Veterans Day, but every day of the year. And it starts on 11/11/11.Read Post | Comments (44)Valerie Jarrett, 11/11/11Senior Advisor and Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Affairs and Public EngagementContinuing our journey toward a more perfect union won\u0027t be easy.

Kirsten Gillibrand, 11/11/11U.S. Senator from New YorkThose who serve in the National Guard and Reserves fight shoulder to shoulder with our active duty troops in battle, yet upon their return home, do not have the same access to benefits and protections.
