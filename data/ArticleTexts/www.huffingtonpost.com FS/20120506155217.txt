{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"On this week\u0027s NBC special about the killing of Osama bin Laden, Brian Williams repeatedly held up the famous photo of administration members watching the raid and asked those in the photo, \"What does it conjure up inside of you?\" This week also brought the latest job numbers, which revealed the lowest percentage of adults working or looking for work in 30 years. Maybe Williams should tape a follow-up special where he holds up a copy of the jobs report and asks administration members, \"What does it conjure up inside of you?\" Contrasting the White House\u0027s relentless focus on the bin Laden operation with its lack of relentless focus on the economy is enough to make one want to scream.

Haass, 05/02/12President, Council on Foreign RelationsPast sacrifice is a poor justification for continued sacrifice unless it is warranted.

Well, it turns out, plenty.Read Post | Comments (76)Arianna Huffington, 05/01/12The Obama administration has every reason to celebrate the anniversary of Osama bin Laden\u0027s killing, as does the country. Less laudable is Obama\u0027s attack ad questioning whether Mitt Romney would have made the same call to go after the man behind the 9/11 attacks.Read Post | Comments (1,685)David Bromwich, 05/03/12Professor of Literature at YaleIn his campaign to win the election as a war president, Barack Obama flatters the worst vices of chauvinism and panders to the most vulgar and brutal idea of the qualities that define a leader and the actions that ennoble a country. No alchemy of eloquence can atone for the confession of moral surrender involved in such a boast.Read Post | Comments (894)Jason Linkins and Elyse Siegel, 05/04/12CNN is terrible.

Online education can complement this educational environment. But it does not replace the need for it.Read Post | Comments (32)Michelle Rhee, 04/30/12Founder and CEO of StudentsFirstThis is the basic truth I want to tell these schools: it doesn\u0027t matter if a school is a for-profit or a non-profit, it needs to be doing a good job educating students. And if it\u0027s failing to do that, it should be shut down.Read Post | Comments (49)Cheech Marin, 05/03/12Actor/Comedian/Activist/Art CollectorTo me, you have to declare yourself a Chicano in order to be a Chicano.
