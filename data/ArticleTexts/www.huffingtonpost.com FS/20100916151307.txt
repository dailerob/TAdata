Innovation has always been part of HuffPost\u0027s DNA. So we\u0027re pleased to recognize those who are pushing the envelope. Our Game Changers operate in multiple worlds but, whatever the arena, they share a common trait: a willingness to look at things and take the risk of saying, \"I think I have a better way.\" To salute these Game Changers, we\u0027ve put together slideshows giving you the lowdown on who we picked, why we picked them, and how they are changing the game. But that\u0027s just the beginning: now it\u0027s up to you to vote for the Ultimate Game Changer in each category. Click here to find out more about who we picked and how to cast your vote.Read Post | CommentsBob Cesca, 09.15.2010Host of the Bob and Elvis ShowAsk yourself, Republican people, what if you miss a Senate majority by just one seat?
