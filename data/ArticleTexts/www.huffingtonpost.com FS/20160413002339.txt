{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Actress, ActivistToday marks \"Equal Pay Day,\" the day when women\u0027s pay finally catches up to men\u0027s pay from last year. You\u0027ll have to forgive me for not cheering too loudly. Each year Equal Pay Day highlights how far we still have to go in the fight for pay equity, and it\u0027s striking how little headway has been made on closing the gap in recent years, with progress all but stagnating in the past decade. Across the board, women continue to be paid less than their male counterparts -- a fact that takes on new significance in an election year where the views of the Republican presidential candidates on the gender pay gap range from dismissive to downright hostile.Founder of Action ButtonEmployers should take the lead by dismantling the \"all-nighter\" culture, rewarding performance by measures other than by hours logged. Staying late in the office, or firing off emails at 3AM, shouldn\u0027t be seen as a mark of success, but a warning sign.CEO, Global CitizenWomen in unions earn higher wages than their non-union counterparts. Why is that? Part of the answer is obvious: unions are able to use the power of collective bargaining to fight for higher wages overall. But that\u0027s not the entire picture.Co-director, Make It WorkVoters in the Democratic primary, as well as those in the Black community and civil rights community in general as represented by NAN, have to choose between two formidable and qualified candidates. But frankly, neither are as good as they claim, or as bad as their opponent casts them as. One need only look at the two individuals\u0027 own statements and actions.President, National Action NetworkThe Constitution -- the very one that we, along with millions of other veterans swore to uphold when we joined the military -- is clear on this issue.Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranFormer U.S. senator from GeorgiaWould you mind if your employees showed up drunk to work every day? It\u0027s such an absurd question it\u0027s almost laughable. Of course you would! However, that\u0027s exactly what we are getting if we don\u0027t help our employees get a good night\u0027s sleep every night.Founder and CEO, Next JumpI am glad to report that one very bad idea, coming out of Oklahoma, is dead, at least for now. A key Oklahoma Senate committee has chosen not to take up a bill to ban charitable giving by the state\u0027s citizens to animal welfare groups.President and CEO, The Humane Society of the United StatesWhen it comes to their political beliefs and influence, the rich are very different indeed. And the ways in which they are different have deep implications for \"you and me\" in 2016 and beyond.Novelist and contributing opinion writerA new wave of activism against student debt is on the move again this week. The students taking the lead represent the advance guard of an even more massive army which is mobilizing around the idea that higher education should be an investment we make as a society.Co-Director, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureSenior Fellow, Advanced Leadership Initiative, Harvard University.

Works at the firm Shallman CommunicationsToday we recognize Equal Pay Day, a day that symbolically represents when a woman\u0027s wage finally catches up to what a man was paid in the previous year. Despite often being equally qualified, a man\u0027s pay outpaces a woman\u0027s by 79 cents for every dollar.U.S. Representative from Illinois\u0027 8th Congressional DistrictCongressman Representing Illinois\u0027 4th District in ChicagoU.S. Representative for Illinois\u0027 5th DistrictU.S. Representative for Illinois\u0027s 9th congressional districtPerhaps she was doing the usual political exaggeration in order to feel our pain -- the flip side of coming under sniper fire in Bosnia when you weren\u0027t -- that sort of thing. Or maybe, she misremembered her actual income. It might have been much lower than she recalled on Tuesday. It certainly must seem like chicken feed if you\u0027re accustomed to receiving from Wall Street $250,000 per speech.Author, \"Runaway Inequality: An Activist\u0027s Guide to Economic Justice\"The U.S. stands alone among industrialized countries in having no national paid leave policy. Only 13 percent of workers here receive such a benefit through their employer. While many companies do a terrific job, at least for mothers who give birth, most do very little.Director, Family Values @ WorkPresident, National Center on Adoption and Permanency and Myriad Strategic PartnersMore big-name musicians must step forward and say: \"There\u0027s always more money, but I only have one name. And I won\u0027t have people shouting my name in states where there are citizens who have no rights.\"Editor of HeadButler.comI only knew I was pregnant for about a week when I miscarried. We were so damn excited. We were going to be parents. Then we weren\u0027t.writer, musician, dog mom, yogi, military spouse, runner, mermaid, laughter captain, and educatorIf you were hoping for our people to run away, then you\u0027ve never looked at us properly. I personally am going to stay here, right where you don\u0027t want me -- and I\u0027d like to see you try to stop me. I thought America was progressive, not oppressive.Student at Ohlone CollegeBy a margin of 80 to 8, a poll conducted late last year of one thousand business executives who are members of a local, state or national Chamber of Commerce shows overwhelming support for raising the minimum wage.Policy advocate and writer, National Employment Law ProjectA report published last week by the IMF\u0027s own research department concludes that its policies contributed to Europe\u0027s anemic economic recovery.General Secretary, International Trade Union ConfederationAs the President and CEO of Women\u0027s Foundation, I\u0027m often asked by supporters, \"How can we help close the gender pay gap?\" In the past, I\u0027ve encouraged them to help raise awareness of the issue, to advocate for policy changes in state and local governments, as we\u0027ve done. But now we have another tool in our toolkiPresident \u0026 CEO, Women\u0027s FoundationEver wonder how top executives like former Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina can walk away with $100 million after nearly wrecking a major corporation? The answer is that the market doesn’t work the same way at the top as it does for the rest of us.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Recent bankruptcy filings reveal that coal companies are still funding climate science denier groups.Senior Writer, Union of Concerned ScientistsFormer President Bill Clinton made headlines last week when, in response to protests, he defended Hillary Clinton\u0027s description of urban youths as \"super-predators\" during his administration.PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorWomen negotiate 30 percent less often then men and when we do, we ask for up to $16,000 less. The question is why?CEO \u0026 FounderIgnoring symptoms of climate change, or denying that it is happening, does not help us any more than it helps someone with early signs of cancer. he only way that we can save ourselves is if we face this difficult and scary diagnosis. Climate change is happening.Nurse, researcher, writer, activist, mother, seeker of answers to the \"Big Questions\"The roots of populism stretch back to the beginning of the end of the Roman Republic.

And was silenced.Social strategist, audience engagement and tech advisorTrying to explain The Donald Phenomenon to my kids is a lost cause from the start. It\u0027s not that I should teach my kids about him, but that my kids could teach him a thing or two about how to be a good person. Maybe what we need to do is take Donald Trump back to toddler town.Columnist, Waging Nonviolence; author of \"It Runs in the Family: On Being Raised by Radicals and Growing into Rebellious Motherhood\"The data doesn\u0027t lie. Silicon Valley and the tech industry have a diversity/inclusion problem. When it comes to access to capital, most investment firms and teams, and the companies that receive investment, are led by Whites.Founder and president, Rainbow/PUSH CoalitionI think he knew better than to subject himself to his peers during those unattended morning hours. The schoolyard could be a dangerous place for all of us, especially if you were different.Public health academic and advocateYes, it is tax season yet again and you probably paid more taxes than Verizon NY.
