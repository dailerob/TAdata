{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Doug BandowSenior Fellow, the Cato InstituteObama administration policy toward Syria is a slow train wreck. Unremitting pressure from war-minded elites is pushing President Barack Obama closer to military intervention in the bloody civil war. Yet getting involved would be a fool\u0027s errand. Nevertheless, America\u0027s putative allies appear to believe that they are entitled to U.S. support. The president should disabuse them of this dangerous notion. War should be a matter of necessity, not choice. Of course, the Sirens\u0027 call of intervention usually promises quick and humane results. Alas, Americans seem to be constantly rediscovering that military operations rarely go as planned and the costs of conflict usually are far higher than expected.Comments (207)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureWhy haven\u0027t any bankers gone to jail? What\u0027s going on in this country? Here are seven things about Wall Street crime and Washington \"justice\" you might have wanted to know, but were probably too depressed to ask.Comments (306)Lynn ParramoreAlterNet Editor; Co-founder, Recessionwire; Founding Editor of New Deal 2.0Before dismissing a man who made a mistake five years ago, women should look at the total record and the whole person before deciding if Eliot Spitzer is a candidate worth supporting.Comments (102)Russ BelvilleHost of The Russ Belville ShowIt seems that even though fewer young people are trying marijuana, more of them are currently using it. However, current use steadily declines as the marijuana smoker ages... so much for the super-potent, highly-addictive modern marijuana.Comments (218)Rachel Macy StaffordSpecial Education TeacherAlthough the words \"hurry up\" did little if nothing to increase my child\u0027s speed, I said them anyway. Maybe even more than the words, \"I love you.\" The truth hurts, but the truth heals... and brings me closer to the parent I want to be.Comments (403)Claire FallonDeputy Blog Editor, The Huffington PostWhat makes a book chick lit as opposed to literary fiction? This question is, in reality, not difficult to answer -- at least for any thoughtful reader who enjoys a variety of fiction -- but it continues to surface.CommentsSeth ShulmanSenior Staff Writer, Union of Concerned ScientistsWhile Koch-funded groups like AFP are unlikely to heed the message anytime soon, there is every indication in the solar energy field that the political terrain is starting to shift dramatically.Comments (56)Jeff GuinnAuthorThere is far more to the life of Charles Manson than anyone could have imagined. Much of what has previously been believed isn\u0027t true.Comments (177)Stephen FryBritish Actor, Writer, Lord of Dance, Prince of Swimwear \u0026 BloggerAn absolute ban on the Russian Winter Olympics of 2014 on Sochi is simply essential. Stage them elsewhere in Utah, Lillyhammer, anywhere you like. At all costs Putin cannot be seen to have the approval of the civilised world.Comments (1,099)Amy Myers, M.D.Founder and medical director, Austin UltraHealthWe\u0027re no longer eating the wheat that our parents ate. This has lead to increased systemic inflammation, widespread gluten intolerance and higher rates of celiac disease.Comments (199)Michael T. KlareAuthor and Professor of Peace and World-Security Studies, Hampshire CollegeThe energy industry is not investing in any significant way in renewables. Instead, it is pouring its historic profits into new fossil-fuel projects, mainly involving the exploitation of what are called \"unconventional\" oil and gas reserves.Comments (130)Mike DeSimone and Jeff JenssenAuthors of Wines of the Southern HemisphereThe bounty of summer produce available at farmers markets tilts our diet towards the vegetarian end of the spectrum, at least until fall sets in and we start craving heavier fare. Here are some of our favorite finds to help beat summer\u0027s heat.CommentsSarah Elizabeth RichardsJournalist; Author, Motherhood RescheduledMore and more women are seeking refuge in the freezer. It\u0027s nice in the world of \"Maybe someday. Just not now.\" But we all know that the respite from the biological clock is temporary.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThe more I hang around the DC tax debate, the more I\u0027m exposed to deeply misguided thinking that seems largely motivated by the conviction that poor people -- in this case, the working poor -- have too much money and the wealthy have too little.Comments (157)Cyd ZeiglerCo-founder, Outsports.comWhile the Russians would love an American boycott of the Games, being banned from their own Games would help drive public sentiment. Instead of asking our athletes to carry messages that would fall on deaf ears, it would drive Russian Olympic hopefuls to speak out to their own government.Comments (185)David McRaneyJournalistOwning and operating a brain is hard. You are issued one at birth, a model that comes riddled with delusions and biases, prone to logical fallacies, and built to create stories to help explain the difficult and messy business of being a person.Comments (132)Michele MasterfanoClinical Assistant Professor, Drexel UniversityIf our companies cannot find skilled employees, why don\u0027t they hire for aptitude and provide the specific training for the skills and abilities they need?Comments (146)Imam Khalid LatifExecutive Director and Chaplain, Islamic Center at New York UniversityFor those celebrating the Eid ul-Fitr holiday, Eid Mubarak. May your day be blessed and full of joy. For those not celebrating, may your day be blessed moreso. It doesn\u0027t have to be a holiday to feel uplifted. We don\u0027t need always need reasons to be happy, as we usually do to be sad.CommentsAnn BrenoffSenior Writer, The Huffington PostOne of my all-time favorite movies is the 1991 \u0027L.A. Story\u0027 where Steve Martin plays a confused TV weatherman who takes his life cues from a talking freeway sign. In that same vein, my wine bottle just spoke to me. When the cork popped out, it said \u0027Plan some spontaneity.\u0027CommentsStanford Center for Sleep Sciences and MedicineSleep-related eating disorders may involve the consumption of peculiar food and inedible or toxic substances. Reports include consuming a variety of items, nearly anything imaginable, including: frozen pizzas, raw bacon, buttered cigarettes and cleaning solutions.CommentsSean McElweeWriterThe fact that we must still advocate for the minimum wage, progressive taxation, unions and Social Security -- programs taken for granted decades ago - indicates how barbaric our society has become. That is why raising the minimum wage is the only moral option available to us today.Comments (32)SmarterTravelSmartertravel.comHere are eight ways you might be ruining your vacation even before you land, plus tips for beating the odds and arriving primed to squeeze every last fabulous drop out of your travels.Comments (121)Dan GlickmanVice President of the Aspen Institute and Senior Fellow at the Bipartisan Policy CenterI recently had the opportunity to observe a U.S. citizenship naturalization ceremony. The hope and optimism of these new Americans, some of whom will start businesses or join the military, is so refreshing and yet incongruous with the tone of the debate within Washington.Comments (12)Christine Page, MDPioneer in women\u0027s healthcareAs women have fought to be part of a man\u0027s world over the past few decades, they have often been required to suppress their feminine nature to make room for masculine traits.Comments (12)Matthew Hurley, Dan Dennett and Reginald B. AdamsWhen there is a well-defined, unambiguous hypothesis to test, an experiment can be very simple: find a clear counterexample. In the case of a theory of humor, find something that is funny but is not predicted to be funny by the hypothesis, or something the hypothesis says should be funny that isn\u0027t.CommentsRobert WalkerPresident, Population InstituteMy wife and I chose to be \"child-free\" long before the term was invented. We decided that having a child was not for us. It was not a terribly difficult decision. We like children, but we did not like them enough to take on the commitment of raising them.Comments (146)Mark Hyman, MDPracticing physicianIt\u0027s easy to eat fresh, locally grown food when fruits and vegetables are as abundant and available as they are during the summer months. And when food is more available, it\u0027s more affordable, too.CommentsMax Jacobson-FriedWriter, CrossFitterI\u0027m not sure when it happened, but at some point in my mid to late 20s, I reached a state of general malaise. I knew CrossFit had something to do with doing 100 pull ups and throwing up, which was a fancy stretch from my normal routine. I signed up for an Intro course and jumped right in.Comments (773)Morris W. O\u0027KellyHost of \"The Mo\u0027Kelly Show\" on KFI am640 and XM Satellite RadioWe\u0027re not in search of black faces repeating exactly what was said previously by the white ones. Trust me, we aren\u0027t. We\u0027re in search of meaningful inclusion and substantive competition for our votes on a policy level.Comments (771)Sarah KooimanBloggerDear Section 113, Row 17, Seat 22: Thank you for what you did for my son at Miller Park on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. You made my boy feel like a rockstar. You didn\u0027t have to. You chose to. And I am sincerely grateful to you for it.Comments (115)Mirabai HollandBoomer Fitness Expert, creator, Moving Free® TechniqueWe can\u0027t eliminate the stress. But we can relieve the fight-or-flight response that sends our bodies into danger mode. And we can cultivate a relaxation response over time that will reduce our physiological stress reaction.Comments (30)Keith Barry, 2013. 9.08Bridget Fonger, 2013. 8.08Steve Rhode, 2013. 8.08Peter Dreier, 2013. 8.08Edward Goldberg, 2013. 8.08James Scarborough, 2013. 8.08Richard (RJ) Eskow, 2013. 8.08Azadeh Shahshahani, 2013. 8.08Dave Astor, 2013. 8.08Amb.
