{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week got off to a horrifying start as a 9-year-old girl accidentally shot a gun range instructor with a fully automatic Uzi. While the manager of the Bullets and Burgers range promised a \"policy review,\" how about one for the country? Let\u0027s look at why 30 states allow children to own long guns; at why the number of kids dying from gunshot wounds is up nearly 60 percent in 10 years; at why twice as many kids die each year from guns than cancer; at why almost 200 children died from gun violence the year after Sandy Hook. And at what it says about our real regard for child safety that all this can be true while, last month, a mom was arrested for letting her 9-year-old daughter play alone at a playground. This latest gun-related tragedy certainly has more than one victim. How many more children\u0027s lives have to be destroyed for us to come to our senses?As the investigation into the facts of this horrifying incident proceeds, we are left with the painful, inescapable realization that our justice system has brutally failed once again, for there can be no justification whatsoever for the police slaying of an unarmed young man.Chief Executive Officer, The King CenterThose stout-hearted Americans who were so upset that their president discussed serious matters in a tan suit last week, had good and patriotic reason for their outbursts. But perhaps they didn\u0027t notice what would certainly have relieved them of their concern.Founder, People for the American WayThe new ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has immediately raised the same old question: Will it last, or is it merely just another pause, providing the prelude for the next round of fighting à la previous ceasefires? I believe the current ceasefire is different as it was achieved under completely different circumstances and may well last.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUWherever I go around the world, I see the same hunger to live our lives with more meaning and purpose and less unnecessary stress and burnout.Sure, we must pay attention to what our graduates will do with their education, and we must give them the skills to translate what they learn in classrooms to their lives after graduation. But we shouldn\u0027t reduce our understanding of \"their lives after graduation\" to their very first job.President, Wesleyan UniversityThe truth is, as long as nuclear weapons exist, we are not safe. The human and environmental devastation caused by nuclear weapons -- whether by testing, mistake or malice -- is the very reason we need to eliminate them altogether.Fmr. CIA covert operations officerLong term, ISIS and the lure of other violent extremism in Islam and other religions will only be stopped if we are all invested in reaching out to young people. We have to be available to listen to their concerns, empathize with their sense of alienation, and help them find constructive ways to engage societal injustice.Executive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostImagine schools where children were tested every three or four years, at transition points, as in the world\u0027s top-performing nations. Imagine schools where teachers wrote their own tests and used their professional judgment.Research Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027Workers are struggling to stay afloat. Incomes haven\u0027t gone up in the 21st century. Inequality reaches new extremes. A record portion of our national income goes to corporate profits, while a record low goes into workers\u0027 wages. Three-fourths of Americans fear their children will fare less well than they have.President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureAbd al-Wahhab argued that all Muslims must individually pledge their allegiance to a single Muslim leader (a Caliph, if there were one). Those who would not conform to this view should be killed, their wives and daughters violated, and their possessions confiscated, he wrote.Fmr. MI-6 agent; Author, \u0027Resistance: The Essence of Islamic Revolution\u0027The cumulative and convergent toll of subtle, but discouraging, adult actions in schools and other child-serving systems they come into contact with too often impedes the success of children of color, especially those who are poor, and burdens them with an emotional toll they don\u0027t deserve.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundShould we know whether or not our kids, or ourselves, are overweight? Of course, just as we should know -- before a mechanical calamity -- that the oil in our car needs changing, or our tire pressure is low.Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterInstead of joining with Democrats to expand opportunity for all Americans by fighting for equal pay and a raise for millions of Americans, investing in infrastructure and education, and creating jobs, Republicans like Rubio have recommitted to digging in their heels and causing rampant dysfunction that hurts middle class families.Author, \u0027For the Next Generation\u0027; Chair, Democratic National CommitteeI wasn\u0027t supposed to walk away from the NFL, but I did. I wasn\u0027t supposed to be writing television, but I am. I\u0027m supposed to be lost after football. I\u0027m not. I\u0027ve reinvented myself. This is my first transformation.6-year NFL veteran, screenwriter, creatorSen. Bob Corker told the Wilson Center last June that, looking back on more than a decade of armed conflict with al-Qaeda, Congress finds itself left with \"no ownership whatsoever\" of U.S. counterterrorism policy. He called the hands-off congressional approach \"totally feckless\" -- and he\u0027s right.Director, Woodrow Wilson Center; Former U.S. CongresswomanLabor Day is seen as a day of rest for many hardworking Americans. But for a growing set of U.S. workers, there is no break from trying to earn enough to support their families. Despite a dip in unemployment during the past few years, low pay continues to plague many employees while their corporate bosses rake in record profits.General President, International Brotherhood of TeamstersMy dad who died of ALS would be frustrated, as I am, that the Ice Bucket Challenge gives the political adversaries of scientific research a pretext to disguise their views and pretend they haven\u0027t made it harder to find a cure, for any disease at all.Associate Special Projects Editor, The Huffington PostNow is the time for the West -- whether NATO, the United States, or individual European states --to provide or sell the high-tech weaponry Ukraine needs to defend itself effectively. The argument against such a move -- that it would provoke a Russian escalation--is no longer valid, now that Russia has escalated. A well-armed Ukraine could stop Putin from embarking on any of these more alarming scenarios.Ukrainian-American Political Scientist, Rutgers UniversityHow do you explain suicidal crickets and zombie caterpillars? One word: parasites. Science writer Ed Yong shows us how these tiny creatures force insects and animals to do their bidding, and asks: Are parasites manipulating humans, too?\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"Today on Women\u0027s Equality Day, we commemorate the passage of women\u0027s right to vote -- celebrating how far we have come, but also recognizing the work that remains. Sometimes it seems like women are the only people coming together across party lines to get things done.Kentucky Secretary of State; Democratic Candidate for US SenateDoing well on tests is not an education, but simply a skill in taking tests. School offers an education that is too precious to be surrendered to those with no understanding of learning\u0027s ultimate meaning and value.Retired high-school teacherHere\u0027s the deal: We are in for the fight of our lives with this monster that is ALS, and the very last thing I want is for people to donate quietly, anonymously and then slink away. Raise the roof! Raise a ruckus! Call all sorts of attention to yourself!Author, blogger, mom, and passionate advocate for a cure for ALSThese critiques of athletes are not new. They have been articulated for years, in barbershops, bars, social media, various articles and blogs, by the everyday fan to the most celebrated scholars. But many still are misguided and inaccurate.Author, poet, philanthropist, 11-year NBA veteranI usually take great pride in calling myself an alumna of The George Washington University -- but not today. Dr. Stephen Joel Trachtenberg, current president emeritus and a professor of public service at GWU, made comments on the Diane Rehm Show this week about how college women drinking too much is feeding the campus rape crisis, and in doing so perpetuated the dangerous notion that it is a woman\u0027s fault for being sexually assaulted or raped. Change is needed on campus, but it does not need to come from the victim.Middle East correspondent, The WorldPostLet\u0027s hypothesize a theater of solitude: a single character grappling with his own interminable discourse -- at intervals whispered and shouted; prosaic one moment, poetic or even epic the next. What is the status, in that case, of this voice that speaks nonstop?Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.I\u0027m sorry you look like a candidate for \"What Not To Wear,\" baby edition. Your brother had all brand-new, super-cute clothes, and you wear mostly his hand-me-downs, so that\u0027s why it\u0027s hard for me to figure out why you are always so disheveled.Bugs, Dirt and MommyThe crime of killing someone is now turned into a battle of narratives where the only other person who could challenge the narrative is dead, and millions of people simply believe that the unarmed black man deserved his fate.Author and Journalist published in Salon.com, the Jerusalem Post, Chicago Tribune, The Hill\u0027s Congress Blog, and other publications. www.hagoodman.comOur conversation about mental illness needs to be a positive, healthy dialogue, not one laden with shame. As soon as that begins to happen, we\u0027ll be able to address these health issues more effectively.Associate Editor, GPS for the Soul, The Huffington PostYou probably disagree with me, and that\u0027s cool; enjoy your sport and find happiness in it. I didn\u0027t. So I\u0027m not going to purposely watch any NFL games anymore.Local Internet userAll over the internet Beyoncé is hailed for bringing FEMINISM to the masses, for delivering it to teens and anyone watching who might have considered it a bad word. If Beyoncé is a feminist, well, hell, then I am, too! Where do I sign up? But what are they signing up for?WriterGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"$1 BILLION ELECTION  BEFORE LABOR DAY!",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
