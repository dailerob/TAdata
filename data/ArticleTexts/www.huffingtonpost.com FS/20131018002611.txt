{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Dylan RatiganNew York Times Best-Selling author, entrepreneur and formerly the host of MSNBC\u0027s The Dylan Ratigan ShowThere is rottenness at the core of our banking and political system, which relies entirely on the money of others -- taxpayers, pensioners, those who pay insurance and, most disturbingly, future American earnings -- to create short-term, private-sector income around housing and finance. With these profits, the banking system deals in politicians by offering political bulletproofing in the form of low-cost financing for housing using -- you guessed it -- other people\u0027s money. Until we deal with this problem, which is deeply entrenched in our election finance system, our government will continue to borrow and tax us to serve its short-term interests even as our lives become more expensive and offer less in return.Comments (37)Bob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowWhen tea party lawmakers stand on National Park Service land and exploit a NPS monument as a backdrop in their strategy to undermine the U.S. economy, it tends to ring hollow knowing how the GOP has been at war against funding for the NPS.Comments (252)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The President has now scored a significant victory over extremist Republicans. But the fight will continue. He mustn\u0027t relinquish ground during the upcoming cease-fire.Comments (356)Ann BrenoffSenior Writer, The Huffington PostI did something very liberating last week; unfortunately, it was liberating with a dash of stupid. After waiting 75 minutes for my appointment to see the doctor, I got mad and walked out.Comments (219)Marie WilsonAn advocate of women’s issues for more than 30 yearsIt was no surprise to read Monday\u0027s front page New York Times article \"Senate Women Lead in Effort to Find Accord\" and see the deadlock over the debt ceiling being brokered by a few of the still small number of women who burst the glass ceiling of the Senate.CommentsRobert CreamerPolitical Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersThe Republicans did not simply lose a tough fight that they knew was a long shot. Much of the Republican leadership fundamentally miscalculated their odds of success -- and underestimated the consequences of defeat.Comments (13)Diane RavitchHistorian, NYU professorWe are America. We should cultivate the wit and wisdom of Ben Franklin, the ingenuity of Thomas Alva Edison, the spirit of the Wright brothers. Were they good test-takers? Who knows? Who cares? I bet the guys at Enron and Madoff had great test scores.Comments (24)Roseanne BarrPresidential Candidate, Peace and Freedom PartyIt took a lot of courage for me to stand almost completely alone in the face of corporate witch-burning terrorism, class attack, and voracious sexist censorship waged against me, from which I have never, and will never fully recover.Comments (33)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureIt\u0027s a major victory. The shutdown\u0027s ending, the government isn\u0027t defaulting (at least not yet), and Democrats didn\u0027t yield in the face of threats and bullying. But what happens next could shape our fate for many years to come.Comments (48)Tom TarantinoChief Policy Officer, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of AmericaVeterans should never again be negatively impacted by the Congressional gridlock that caused the government shutdown. Congress should swiftly pass the Putting Veterans Funding First Act that would fully fund the VA one year in advance.CommentsPetra CollinsArtist, photographer, writerRecently I had my Instagram account deleted. I did nothing that violated the terms of use. No nudity, violence, pornography, unlawful, hateful, or infringing imagery. What I did have was an image of MY body that didn\u0027t meet society\u0027s standard of \"femininity.\"Comments (21)Govindini MurtyFilmmaker and Co-Editor of Libertas Film MagazineIt\u0027s truly refreshing that Sandra Bullock\u0027s character, Dr. Ryan Carter, is depicted in Gravity as an intelligent professional.CommentsClaire FallonDeputy Blog Editor, The Huffington PostOur national preoccupation with the concept is somewhat odd -- no other country seems to share this need to score ambitious new novels by whether it\u0027s a \"Great _____ Novel contender.\"CommentsJim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027Watching the dysfunction in Washington over the past two weeks has been painful. But after the storm comes the promise -- the hope of lessons learned and new ways forward togetherCommentsBob MiglaniAuthor, \u0027Embrace the Chaos\u0027As I thought about my own journey of learning to deal with uncertainty these days, I realized that in the absence of luck being granted to us by the lottery of birth, we all can get a chance to get lucky.Comments (50)Steve McSwainAuthor, Speaker, Leader, Spiritual Teacher, the \"Voice of the SBNR\"I counsel church leaders within every denomination in America, having crisscrossed this country for nearly two decades counseling congregations as small as two hundred in attendance to churches averaging nearly 20,000 in weekly attendance.Comments (971)Rep. Charles RangelRepresentative from the 13th Congressional District in New YorkSome may call it a publicity stunt. Some may call it political theater. For whatever reason some may think I stood out there with thousands of clergy and advocates calling for immigration reform, the fact is that it got attention.CommentsTrey EllisNovelist, Screenwriter, and Associate Professor at Columbia UniversityUp until the Tea Party\u0027s Waterloo, they had been blithely crushing all opponents. Federal irrelevance was beginning to seem the norm. But thanks to their overreach, pretty much shutting down government altogether, a funny thing happened. Ordinary Americans began to miss it.CommentsMohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOWhat emerged from Congress on Wednesday speaks to stop-gap measures born of exhaustion and political miscalculations, and prompted by national (and global) outrage.Comments (97)Mattea Kramer and Jo ComerfordIn that distinction between what was necessary and what wasn\u0027t, it was easy enough to spot the values of the people\u0027s representatives. And what we saw was gut-wrenching. Stomach-churning.CommentsJennifer MeerMother and writer at my-jenneration.blogspot.comWe live in an age where we are constantly fed messages that we should try to do as much as we can as fast as we can; to live at maximum efficiency. Except when we shouldn\u0027t. Sometimes I feel like we are multi-tasking ourselves right past the point of it all anyway.Comments (30)Mike LuxCo-Founder, Democracy PartnersThe Cruz Crazies handed us Democrats this victory. We would have had to be political morons to kick it away. But Democrats have had their politically moronic moments at times over the years, and in this case they did not snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.CommentsDr Mark WilliamsonDirector of Action for Happiness\"Please put your phone down Daddy, we haven\u0027t finished the story!\". Hearing these heartfelt words from my four year old daughter was an uncomfortable wake up call. How had I let the shiny electronic box in my hand take so much of my attention that it could even interrupt a short bedtime story with my precious children?CommentsPierre OmidyarCEO and publisher of Honolulu Civil Beat, Founder of eBayI want to find ways to convert mainstream readers into engaged citizens. I think there\u0027s more that can be done in this space, and I\u0027m eager to explore the possibilities.Comments (14)Elliott NeginDirector of News \u0026 Commentary, Union of Concerned ScientistsAt the same time President Obama has been pressing for further reductions in U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals, the National Nuclear Security Administration is planning to spend $60 billion over the next 25 years to replace existing nuclear weapons with a suite of new warheads.CommentsEmily L. HauserFreelance writer and bloggerMaybe together, we adults can make the world in which our little girls are growing into wonderful women a better place. Please help me. We\u0027re the adults. My daughter, and probably yours, needs our help.Comments (30)ThrillistWe\u0027re a quick, free, daily e-mail ...Don\u0027t believe the printed hype! Keep eating that fish sauce!Comments (111)Craig NewmarkFounder, craigslist and craigconnects.orgWe\u0027ve learned, the hard way, that some nonprofits are really good at telling a really good, heart-rending story. Turns out that they aren\u0027t really good at helping anyone who needs help.CommentsRibal Al-AssadFounder and Director, Organisation for Democracy and Freedom in SyriaWith geopolitical, sectarian and civil divisions honing in on Syria, there are currently three possible outcomes: a victory for the regime, a victory for the overwhelmingly Islamist opposition or an endless war leading to the disintegration of Syria as we know it. None is preferable.CommentsNancy Altman and Eric KingsonNo one is getting rich from Social Security. Social Security beneficiaries have little flexibility in their household budgets. They paid into Social Security throughout their working lives, and have earned a COLA that should keep their benefits at pace with inflation.CommentsJohn TirmanExecutive Director, MIT Center for International StudiesThe war memorials so famously closed during the GOP-induced shutdown are notable for many things, but one of them is rarely mentioned -- the absence of any mention of the civilians who were killed in the wars. It\u0027s a national habit to ignore those civilians. And so it is with Iraq.Comments (13)Joan Williams, 2013.17.10The Second City Network, 2013.17.10Erin Cox, 2013.17.10Ryan Sedmak, 2013.17.10Stacia Pierce, 2013.17.10Cojourneo, 2013.17.10Cojourneo, 2013.17.10Kathleen Buckstaff, 2013.17.10Ashley Jude Collie, 2013.17.10Robert Siciliano, 2013.17.10Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"RIGHTFIGHT: PRIMARY WAR BEGINS",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
