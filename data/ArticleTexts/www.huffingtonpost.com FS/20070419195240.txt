{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"From cspan.org/APReports that Cho Seung-Hui had been taking antidepressants once again turn the spotlight on the uneasy question of what role these powerful medications might have played in yet another campus massacre. It\u0027s the same bloody-morning- after question I\u0027ve been asking since 1998, when we learned 15-year old Oregon school shooter Kip Kinkel had been on Prozac. Nearly ten years -- and numerous school-shooters-on-prescription-meds -- later, we\u0027re still waiting for answers. Here\u0027s what we need to know now: Which meds was Cho taking? How long had he been taking them? What was the diagnosis? What kind of medical and/or psychological follow-up was there? Or was Cho one of the many people put on antidepressants without a thorough and ongoing monitoring of the results and side effects?READ POST | comments (60)04.19.2007 Sen.
