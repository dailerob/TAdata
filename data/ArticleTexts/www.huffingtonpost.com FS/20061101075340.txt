{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"APAPAPThe GOP\u0027s descent into demonization continues. After failing to gain traction with its \"a vote for Democrats is a vote for Osama\" ad campaign, the Republicans\u0027 message machine has adopted an even more irrational strategy: Go after the talk show hosts! That\u0027s right. Painting Jim Webb as a pornographer, Harold Ford as a playah, and Michael J. Fox as a Parkinson\u0027s poseur fizzled. So now it\u0027s Wolf Blitzer, David Letterman, and The View crew in the crosshairs, being sleazed as part of the Hate America First Coalition. Can you think of anything more absurd than trying to score political points by implying that Joy Behar is an al Qaeda appeaser?READ POST10.31.2006 Robert L. BorosageLeave it to the leisure class Democrats to claim victory before a vote is cast. And for the New York Times to fall for their big lie.READ POST | comments (12)10.31.2006 Greg SaundersIt\u0027s amazing to me that the GOP has a reputation for toughness when they throw temper tantrums over meaningless shit.READ POST | comments (15)10.31.2006 Bob GeigerAfter asking Allen a question, Stark was set upon by multiple men, put in a head-lock, wrestled to the ground and almost flung through a plate-glass window.READ POST | comments (12)10.31.2006 Vinod KhoslaDo you think the oil interests are in a hurry to create alternatives to the fuels or help with efficiency improvements to reduce gasoline consumption?

How many Americans have ever even heard the positive case made for the underpinnings of our government -- democracy and community?READ POST | comments10.31.2006 Art LevineIt will rile up conservative voters, so Democrats\u0027 efforts to counter the GOP turnout campaign will become even more essential to a Democratic victory.READ POST | comments (29)10.31.2006 Gerald McEnteeI\u0027m not sure what unholy bargain David Brooks brokered with his editors to write such blasphemy, but here are a few of Saint Santorum\u0027s legislative \"accomplishments\" that Brooks conveniently omitted.READ POST | comments (23)10.31.2006 Clara Jeffery and Monika BauerleinWe may never know when the president first got a hunch that the occupation of Iraq was not working out so well, but we know exactly when things did start to go haywire.READ POST | comments10.31.2006 Taylor MarshKerry should just admit he screwed up his statement.
