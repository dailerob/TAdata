{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of LawDonald Trump shamed himself and his party -- and flunked judicial ethics 101 -- with his flagrantly racist suggestion that an Indiana-born federal judge hearing a lawsuit against his sham Trump University had an \"inherent conflict of interest\" because he was \"of Mexican heritage.\" Putting aside Mr. Trump\u0027s noxious pronouncement, there are situations, unrelated to a judge\u0027s race, ethnicity, gender, or religion, when a genuine conflict of interest exists, and a judge\u0027s recusal is essential for preserving the appearance and reality of judicial fairness central to the nation\u0027s justice system.

Swaziland has the highest rate of HIV infection in the world. Twenty-four per cent of children here have lost one or both parents to AIDS and many are themselves now living with HIV. I thought about my own children and how in many ways the things Sebenele enjoys are the same things they do. Yet he told me how he is struggling to continue to take his antiretroviral medicine, which is vital to ensure he stays healthy, because he can\u0027t keep the pills down without any food.UNICEF Goodwill AmbassadorStudents of color constitute a majority in our schools but teachers of color constitute only 18 percent of their faculties.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundTrump is Trump; and his message and movement are the handiwork of the very establishment that is now rejecting their creations.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Contrary to those in the media and elsewhere who claimed he was \"far more accepting\" on LGBT issues than other GOP candidates, Donald Trump is proving that he very much will be a force against LGBT equality if elected president.Queer Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostPart B drug payment policy.

Author of \u0027Embracing Grief\u0027Losing my mom and my grandma are two of the hardest realities I\u0027ll ever have to face. But I look at my career path, my friendships, and the unexpected professional turns I\u0027ve taken, and one thing is clear: In life and in death, they\u0027ve taught me that our existence is too damn short to not bet on your version of happy. This is mine.Stories \u0026 advice to help you navigate your careerYou may have concluded, \"Well, if even ExxonMobil and the Kochs are saying that kind of thing, we must be getting close to a solution.\" If you did, you would be mistaken.
