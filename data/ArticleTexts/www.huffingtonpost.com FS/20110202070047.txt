Marc Ginsberg, 02.01.2011Former US Ambassador to MoroccoAs the Brotherhood thrusts itself into a central role in any post-Mubarak transitional coalition, the Brotherhood\u0027s rabid ideological brand of Islam is raising the specter of an Egypt potentially slipping into the hands of Islamic extremists.Read Post | CommentsShirin Sadeghi, 02.01.2011Middle East consultant; Former producer for the BBC and Al JazeeraThere is a word in Arabic -- makhlou\u0027 -- which means \"the fallen\" or \"the kicked out.\" It is a word Egypt\u0027s President Hosni Mubarak is trying desperately to avoid being associated with.Read Post | CommentsDoug Kendall, 02.01.2011Founder and President, Constitutional Accountability CenterWhile we should all heed our mother\u0027s advice to eat our vegetables, what matters for the courts should be the text and history of the U.S. Constitution.Read Post | CommentsTeresa Strasser, 02.01.2011Emmy Award-winning writerAfter years of wondering if I\u0027m cut out to be a mother, I\u0027m relieved to find the instinct to protect this fetus is so strong, I figure all of my favorite chemicals can wait.

Wagner, 02.01.2011School of Internatinal \u0026 Public Affairs, Columbia UniversityLeft to spin out of control the net result of the current rioting will most likely be the transition of Egypt into another fundamentalist Islamic state, and we will be facing not a democratic regional partner in peace, but a clone of modern Iran.Read Post | CommentsClarence Lusane, 02.01.2011Professor, American UniversityJust as the radical Republicans, abolitionists, and black activists challenged the arguments of neo-Confederates in the 1860s and 1870s, so, too, should those notions be fought against once again today.Read Post | CommentsDr. Peggy Drexler, 02.01.2011Feminism is ultimately about the freedom to chose and compete and be who you are -- also to tumble into the slime pit of excess.

Dennis Kucinich, 02.01.2011U.S. House RepresentativeIt is time for the United States government to stand with the people of Egypt as well by ending its long-standing support of the corrupt and repressive Mubarak regime.
