That\u0027s why today I\u0027m delighted to announce What\u0027s Working: Purpose + Profit, a new platform, sponsored by PricewaterhouseCoopers, that\u0027s putting a spotlight on the ways businesses are working toward solutions, widening the lens of their concern and moving beyond the obsession with quarterly earnings and short-term gain toward a very different vision. Purpose + Profit will feature stories, insights and tips from leaders in the world of business and thinkers who are driving change, with an emphasis on what\u0027s working in entrepreneurship, B-corporations and impact investing.Poor parents aren\u0027t bad parents, and we aren\u0027t always miserable either. I\u0027m not going to sit here and tell you that I want to remain poor for the rest of my life. Like the vast majority of people, I want the best life for my children. But I\u0027m a little tired of seeing only the bad side of being poor.Scribe of Kiddie Lore \u0026 Torturer of Tech StudentsTraditional human rights groups have long documented the repression of LGBTQ activists in the Middle East. These efforts, unfortunately, have not translated into the improved status of innocent men and women who dare to openly acknowledge their sexual orientation. One human rights activist has taken a different approach.Fellow at the Salomon Center.We are far and away the world leader in putting our own people in jail. Most of the people inside are poor and Black. Here are 40 reasons why.Law Professor, Loyola University New Orleans, CCR Associate Legal DirectorI support Caitlyn. I respect her journey and her story. And I am so, so proud stand behind her and watch her find her happiness. Welcome to the world, Caitlyn Jenner.Student, Writer, Aspiring Filmmaker, ActivistRand Paul is leading on an issue that is near and dear to his political philosophy. You may not agree with where he\u0027s leading, and you may not think this is going to help him politically, but you\u0027ve got to at least admit that he is showing leadership. And that, to me, is admirable.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comPresident Obama\u0027s own Department of the Interior has already predicted that, if Shell is allowed to proceed with drilling, the likelihood of a large spill is 75 percent. So who\u0027s going to clean it up -- and with what completely unproven technology?Executive Director, The Sierra ClubOver the last 25 years, cigarette consumption by smokers in the United States decreased by almost one-third. Over that same period, however, many tobacco companies reengineered cigarettes to more efficiently deliver the nicotine that keeps their customers coming back.Smoking cessation expertI\u0027m titillated that my underwear of choice is now deemed hip. It just affirms the fact that I make solid undergarment choices, which obviously translates into my supreme wisdom over all other topics.Blogger and mother of threeIf you\u0027re going to cut a program which affects the lives of most Americans, the least you can do is get the facts right. Jeb didn\u0027t. That\u0027s worse than a candidate getting the price of bread or milk wrong, or a president\u0027s wonderment at the fact that grocery stores have scanners.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourThe Supreme Court is entering the final stretch of its 2014-15 term, and there are enough momentous decisions on the way to give everyone something to look forward to. This June, the Court will hand down decisions in a number of high-profile cases.Assistant Director at the Institute for JusticeWhen I moved to the United States 10 years ago, I was adamant that I would eventually return to India. I had heard that I wouldn\u0027t. I refused to concede. But I have run out of excuses for my country. My female child is the reason I now choose to lose my motherland.Engineer, Writer, ArtistThe rhetoric of religious freedom and the \u0027war on Christianity\u0027 -- so often used as a justification for discrimination against LGBTQ people -- has nothing to do with religion or faith.Author and opera singerIt could not be more fitting that Caitlyn Jenner will be receiving the Arthur Ashe Award for Courage at this year\u0027s ESPYs, as the internet continues to both praise and debate what it means to have a beloved Olympian come out as a trans woman.Blogger of things. Lover of cheeseburgers and puppies.For those of you who dream of being future doctors, lawyers, financial wizards, architects, or English professors (if there are any of those anymore), you\u0027ll still have to pay exorbitantly for years of graduate school or professional training, which means ever more debt to come.Editor, TomDispatch.comLet\u0027s have a lawsuit where all the \"different\" learners, visionaries, poets, iconoclasts, artists and musicians come together and sue Harvard for giving illegal preference to applicants who brandish their relatively unimportant test scores. That\u0027s a lawsuit I\u0027d join.Head of the Calhoun School in ManhattanMaybe you missed it. Fox News host Neil Cavuto broke the news of Jenner\u0027s Vanity Fair photos in a \"Business Alert\" segment on Monday afternoon. LOL! That business show just cracks me up, let me tell you! I always look for the best comedy (as well as the most sensitive updates about the LGBT community) on Fox\u0027s business report, don\u0027t you?Professor of Theater, Ursinus CollegeAside from the obvious upsides of masturbation that we know and love, here are some of my favorite positive side effects of a routine, healthy dose of self-love.Co-founder and CEO of DAME Products, the brand behind Eva — Indiegogo’s #1 adult product campaign \u0026 top campaign with an all-female teamHere\u0027s a question for you: Which causes more deaths, motor vehicle traffic accidents or firearms? I asked a bunch of people that question, including a bunch of doctors, and everyone said that motor vehicles did.Pediatrician, Boston Children\u0027s Hospital, Harvard Medical SchoolThere is broad, bipartisan support to end the medical device tax, and we urge Congress to make this a priority. Doing so would provide a much-needed boost toward innovation and job creation, while protecting the objectives of health care reform.U.S. Representative, Washington’s 1st DistrictU.S. Representative, Arizona\u0027s 9th Congressional DistrictU.S. Representative, California\u0027s 52nd congressional districtSo it\u0027s quite surprising that while there has been an outpouring of innovation in consumer apps, there has been relatively little imagination displayed so far in the world of business apps. What are needed are more \"authentically mobile\" business apps -- that is, apps centered on new-to-the-world functionality that would have been inconceivable before the smartphone revolution.Academic, Researcher, Writer, EntrepreneurI started out like anyone else, skeptical but intrigued. Who is going to rent my room? Is it safe. Luckily AirBNB has a pretty good verification, review and rating system. So I figured what the heck, let me give it a shot.Entrepreneur, LifeHacker, AirBNB SuperhostThink about what you really want. Forget what you think you should do or what others say you should do. What excites you? What feels impossible? Be honest with yourself.Co-Founder of The Buried Life \u0026 Four Peaks Media GroupI don\u0027t know how or why Caitlyn Jenner found her way to the name we now share, but I am proud as hell to share it with her. For me, my name has always given me strength and pride, but now it can do that for so many others, thanks to Jenner.Correspondent, HuffPost LiveWhen one of the world\u0027s most hostile boundaries starts to look good in any respect compared to our border with Mexico, we have probably taken our obsession with border security too far.Visiting Professor of the Practice, Sanford School of Public Policy, Duke University.Almost a century after their service, Sgt. Henry Johnson and Sgt.

United States opinion, authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, and joined by all others except Justice Clarence Thomas, sidestepped issues of both the Internet and the First Amendment, focusing instead on criminal intent.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityNick Turse\u0027s new book of investigative reporting reveals that the U.S. military has been involved in one way or another -- \"construction, military exercises, advisory assignments, security cooperation, or training missions\" -- with more than 90 percent of Africa\u0027s 54 nations, despite military spokespersons insistence that the U.S. maintains only one permanent \"base.\"Managing Blog Editor, The Huffington PostIt is absurd that the last five years has seen oil extraction returning to previous levels, with rigs drilling even deeper in the Gulf than before the tragedy took place.Vice President, U.S. Oceans, OceanaGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
