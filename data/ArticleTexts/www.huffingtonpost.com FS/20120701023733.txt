{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Children\u0027s Defense FundOn June 25th, the U.S. Supreme Court in Miller v. Alabama banned mandatory sentences of life in prison without parole for juveniles. This is a major victory for children and for America and a giant step forward for justice for children. Until this week, America was the only country in the world to routinely condemn children as young as 13 and 14 to die in prison. Now about two thousand people who were sentenced to die in prison as juveniles have hope for a new hearing and a new sentence. While it is disappointing that the Court did not ban the practice outright, we must keep working toward justice for children and end the devastating Cradle to Prison Pipeline™ crisis that leads to marginalized lives, imprisonment, and premature death.Read Post | Comments (33)James Zogby, 06/30/12President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027President-elect Morsi now has a mandate to govern.
