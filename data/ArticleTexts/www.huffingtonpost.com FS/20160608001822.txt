{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027The weak employment report for May should eliminate any possibility that the Federal Reserve Board will raise interest rates at its June meeting next week. At least for this purpose, the bad news is good news. But we should still be asking why the Fed has its finger on the trigger in the first place. The Fed should not be so anxious to slow the economy at the first sign that the recovery is on a healthy path. The Fed’s anxiousness to raise rates should make the public very concerned. And it is an issue that deserves far more attention than it has been receiving in this election year. First, people should recognize that the May report was seriously bad news about the current state of the labor market. The monthly jobs numbers are always somewhat erratic, but the May report followed a weak April report and included downward revisions to the data for the prior two months.Through tax-deductible \"charitable\" donations, the Kochs are systematically manufacturing a legion of \"experts\" at universities and think tanks across the country -- and then fighting to place them in Executive Branch positions so they can undermine the government from the inside.Democratic Senator from MassachusettsDemocratic Senator from Rhode IslandDemocratic U.S. Senator from New YorkYou love your son and you should. But love him enough to teach him to own the terrible decisions he\u0027s made, to pay the debt to society as prescribed, and then to find a redemptive path to walk, doing the great work in the world that you say he will.Pastor and WriterThere is nothing more American than our vote. There is too much to lose if we don\u0027t show up. I don\u0027t want someone else deciding if my loved one gets to sleep soundly at night without fear of deportation or how a Latina makes decisions for her future and her body. Do you?Actor and activistIf \"lesser of two evilism\" is too tawdry a notion for you, then I encourage you to reword the concept. If you don\u0027t get the leader you most want, make sure you get the one you can most influence, and control.Actor, author, screenwriter, and journalistThat GOP senators are now working to hold the seat open for a man who thinks some judges can\u0027t do their jobs because of their ethnic background or religion is unconscionable and should be, quite frankly, embarrassing to all Republicans.President, People For the American WayThe Verizon strike showed what workers can do when they stand up and stand together, and now those workers have a chance to show that the labor movement can expand and thrive in today\u0027s economy.Executive Director of the National Employment Law ProjectDonald Trump would do more to promote the spread of jihadist terrorism than any military victory ever could. Unleashing him as president in a world of dangerous and complex geopolitics would be akin to giving a hand grenade to a two-year-old in a crowded room. Come Election Day, the rest of us must be grown-ups.Novelist and contributing opinion writerIn my years of studying politics at work, I know the \"thin pink line\" women walk to be sure that aren\u0027t disliked. Clinton is liked or else she wouldn\u0027t be where she is today -- a heartbeat away from being the first woman U.S. president.Professor Emerita, USC Marshall School; Author, \u0027The Secret Handshake\u0027 and \u0027Shadow Campus\u0027This year\u0027s Democratic primary in Michigan marked one of the biggest errors in polling history. Combined polling averages showed Hillary Clinton leading by 18 percentage points or more, but she still ended up losing to Bernie Sanders by 1.5 percentage points, setting what may be a new record for the biggest upset against polling averages.Mark Blumenthal is the Head of Election Polling at SurveyMonkey.Amid longstanding speculation that Prince died of an overdose, last week, toxicology results confirmed that Prince tragically died from an accidental overdose of fentanyl. He is now one of nearly 19,000 Americans who die from opioid-based medication each year.Communications Associate, Drug Policy AllianceIf Hillary Clinton wants to mobilize Sanders\u0027 supporters for the November election, she should simply build on her past record and call on Americans to construct a stakeholder society.Professor of law and political science, Yale; Author \u0027We the People:The Civil Rights Revolution\u0027Professor of Law at Yale Law School, Author of \u0027A New Deal for Old Age\u0027In the black community, mental illness is thought of as a \"white person\u0027s disease.\" It is nothing that affects black people. But mental illness is not dependent upon race or gender. Your emotions are valid, and you are valid.Black millennial discussing and analyzing social issues within society, with a focus on race, gender and sexualityInstead of seeking justice for Harambe, or improving zoo policies or exhibit design, we should first ask what, precisely, are we conserving in zoos? In my view, we are perpetuating an outmoded worldview rooted in colonialism.Independent source of news and analysis, from the academic and research community.The consensus among many Venezuelans these days is that something big is going to happen, and it will be bad.Journalist and authorOne poll exists from New Mexico, but it is really too old to be very informative. Back in late February, Clinton was up over Sanders by 14 points (47 to 33 percent). That\u0027s not much to go on now, though.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comSocial Security\u0027s adversaries are still out there. Republicans still embrace the economic austerity that wounded Europe and hamstrung our own recovery. Democrats at the Summit kowtowed to their hosts\u0027 deficit obsession. And the media personalities in attendance (were they paid?) offered chipper testimonials -- pitches, really -- for deficit reduction.Writer/Editor, Bernie 2016For Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, getting his candidate into the White House is all that matters -- no matter how racist and divisive that candidate might be. And so, with this, we can mark the official death of the party of Lincoln.Appellate lawyer in Dallas, TX, handling both civil and criminal appeals.Julie Cobio Firkins prayed and then walked into a room to watch her 33-year-old husband die. \"The video that you\u0027re going to see is very sad,\" she remembers the officer warning her--twice--before playing footage from a police bodycam. But as the tape rolled, she had a different thought: \"It was brutal, not sad.\"The full spectrum of human relationships with drugsAll that I\u0027m saying is that if you have pets, you can\u0027t hate zoos. Period. Think about it. You can call an animal a zoo prisoner or call it the family Chihuahua, and either way, what you are dealing with is a captive animal.Writer, reader, library patron. Happy person.When we say that putting George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, and other top officials in their administration in prison for war crimes would be justice, we endorse a criminal justice system that is more criminal than just, and where torture is a daily occurrence.Author, \u0027American Nuremberg: The U.S. Officials Who Should Stand Trial for Post-9/11 War Crimes\u0027As a black woman, I have internalized so many messages that are vicious, and often subtle attacks on our subconscious and our entire being -- our skin, our bodies, and our hair. I have to fight against these messages for my daughter -- and yours -- every single day.Wife, Mom, and CEO, Co-Host of the Haute Cocoa Mommies Podcast\"Mommy, will you carry me to bed like a wittle baby?\" I hear her tiny voice ask as she stretches out on the couch and waits for me to scoop her up, like I do every time she makes the request.Wife, mother, blogger, educator, bookwormProgress is rarely linear. But I am quite certain that my daughters, like so many children of their generation, will never need to ask of a parent such a regrettable question: \"Is the lesbian dead yet?\"Founder and Writer at West.Energy MediaThe next time someone shows you the latest and greatest feature on their brand new smartphone, remember not only Harambe, but all of the world\u0027s gorillas, and ask yourself if you really truly need it.backyard farmer, outdoor enthusiast, engineer, dad, and Packer fanLet\u0027s make sure we tell our sons, our brothers, our nephews, and our friends -- ?there is no excuse, there is no passive voice, there is no space for your suffering when you take away someone\u0027s dignity and violate someone\u0027s body.Professional storyteller, writer/editor, advocate, podcaster, proud mom.You guys have all the luck, don\u0027t you? You get to rape women and suffer almost no consequences. Society -- specifically, rape culture -- doesn\u0027t want to see you punished for a violent assault because you\u0027re supposed to represent the American dream.Author of American Woman: The Poll Dance, Media Director for We Are WomanWe so easily lump all Muslims into radical-extremist categories. We judge a massive population of faithful, compassionate people by the actions of a small pocket of crazed fundamentalists. The ways that we interact with people of different faiths holds great promise for peace in the world.Lead Pastor at Forefront Manhattan, New York CItyI don\u0027t really care whether Hillary has grabbed the gun violence issue because it\u0027s smart politics or not; how it positions her against Bernie is of no concern of mine. Let\u0027s get selfish for a minute and ask what her stance on gun violence does for us.Mike the Gun GuyHena Khan, 42, an American Muslim author, thinks children\u0027s books and religious literacy might be a partial answer to increased Islamophobia.We loved our daughter and were proud of her. A murderer took her life in a theater -- a place where anyone should feel safe. Those are the facts. The corporate gun lobby trolls should be ashamed of themselves for blowing smoke instead of putting out the fire.Parents of Aurora victim Jessica GhawiGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
