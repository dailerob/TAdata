{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressGoing into tonight\u0027s debate, Mitt Romney has a decent chance to alter the underlying dynamics of the campaign and achieve a somewhat more favorable position to close the gap with President Barack Obama in the remaining weeks of the race. But apparently, this is all for naught, because according to Mark Halperin, Mitt Romney has already lost an utterly critical political constituency, and is probably doomed to wander the earth like a pauper, or whatever. \"Mitt Romney decisively loses the Tom Friedman Primary,\" Halperin tells us. It should be pointed out, though, that Romney\u0027s inability to win Friedman\u0027s favor and prevent Halperin\u0027s ensuing concern is very similar to Romney\u0027s alienating the \"47 percent\" in his famous donor-party remarks, because Friedman and Halperin account for 47 percent of the BS that is written about politics in America.Read Post | Comments (501)Dr. Judith Rodin, 10/03/12President of the Rockefeller FoundationIn the world of finance, ROI -- \"return on investment\" -- rules the day. But there is a new kind of investor nowadays seeking a different kind of return. We call them impact investors, and they seek to put markets to work for millions of people around the globe.Read Post | CommentsDr. Linda Arnold, 10.01.2012Associate Professor of Pediatrics, Yale School of MedicineThere are many places in the world where parents dare not select their babies\u0027 names in advance. It\u0027s not that these parents love their children less than we do, it\u0027s because they know there is a good chance their babies will die.Read Post | Comments (11)Robert Redford, 10/03/12Actor, director, and environmental activistI\u0027m fairly sure Mitt Romney thinks he has an ace in the hole by using the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline against President Obama. So let\u0027s take a quick look at what he might say and what are the actual facts.Read Post | Comments (22)David Westin, 10/03/12Author, \u0027Exit Interview\u0027; Former President, ABC NewsThere\u0027s something uplifting about saying we should all be focused on the \"issues\" and not the \"personalities\" in the presidential debates. But is that right?Read Post | Comments (15)Jason Alexander, Richard Greene, Rosario Dawson and Peter Coyote, 10/03/12We humbly ask our fans to not watch our TV shows or movies, or listen to our music tonight.

But I don\u0027t expect much.Read Post | Comments (430)John Dear and John Cusack, 10/02/12Californians have the chance to make history on November 6th.

Romney appeared to take note before answering Russert, \"I\u0027m not going to raise taxes.\"Read Post | Comments (134)Patricia Cornwell, 10/02/12If President Obama is reelected, and I hope he is, maybe he should take a close look at those his administration appoints to serve the public objectively and without conflict or unseemly allegiances. And maybe it\u0027s time to hold financial institutions accountable for their greed and questionable practices.Read Post | Comments (174)Jackie Morgan MacDougall, 10/02/12Executive Editor, TheRickiLakeShow.comMy breasts didn\u0027t define me before they were removed.

Or that more such experience would be good for them. What is clear is that the very environments that play up the importance of doing well make it even less likely that doing poorly will have any beneficial effect.Read Post | Comments (41)Matthew Chapman, 10/03/12Writer, director, \"The Ledge\"In a recent poll almost 85% of likely voters said they wanted the candidates to hold a debate on science. Why? Because, more than anything else, our kids\u0027 future health and happiness depend on it. And yet, in spite of the many critical issues involved, I\u0027m willing to bet little in the debates will touch on it.Read Post | Comments (32)Dan Glickman, 10/03/12Dan Glickman is Vice President of the Aspen Institute and Senior Fellow at the Bipartisan Policy CenterCongress has a long history of bipartisan support for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly the Food Stamp Program.
