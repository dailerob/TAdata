{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureThese are the same Republicans who squandered over three trillion dollars on the unfunded \"war of choice\" in Iraq. And now spending a billion on the veterans who risked their lives in that folly imposes too big a burden on our grandchildren. This is disgraceful politics. Naturally, the two Republican senators in close re-election races -- Scott Brown in Massachusetts and Dean Heller of Nevada -- were given permission to vote for the bill. The rest either are in safe seats or assume that Americans will forget by the time they come up for re-election. They\u0027ll salute the troops, march in the parades, celebrate the returning heroes, and call for larding more billions into the Pentagon. But a small jobs programs for veterans in need of work? Not this year, not before the election.Read Post | Comments (778)Howard Fineman, 09/20/12Editorial Director, AOL Huffington Post Media GroupTiming is everything in politics, and President Obama is getting just enough verifiable positive economic news just in time to propel him into the lead against Romney on this 47th day before the election.Read Post | Comments (119)Thomas H.

It sounds like he and the rest of the campaign need to hit the off buttons on their devices and get some more restorative sleep, for more clarity and better judgment.Read Post | Comments (576)Marlo Thomas, 09/20/12Award-winning actress, author, and activistHere\u0027s a look at some of this year\u0027s Emmy hopefuls -- along with a few actresses we wish had been nominated (Kyra Sedgwick?
