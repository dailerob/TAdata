The New York Times points out that, in several red states, including What\u0027s-The-Matter-With-Kansas, governors are pushing to do away with income taxes and replace them with sales taxes. Such moves would erode public services and put a greater burden on lower-income families, while rewarding the rich who have money to save and invest. One advocate grumbles to the NYT that this would totally help state economies, if only people would stop worrying about such frivolities as \"fairness.\"Read Post | Comments (52)Devon Corneal, 01/28/13Lawyer, MotherI don\u0027t think anyone sets out to be rude or judgmental, but I\u0027ve been surprised at what well-meaning and generally thoughtful people say to mothers who aren\u0027t staying home full-time with their children.Read Post | Comments (191)Menachem Rosensaft, 01/28/13Professor of law and son of Holocaust survivorsPresident Obama himself recognizes the need for a rational middle ground and urges \"advocates of gun control... to do a little more listening.\" Fair enough. But those on the gun rights side of the debate would be well advised start by listening to none other than Ronald Reagan.Read Post | Comments (928)Leo W. Gerard, 01/28/13International President, United SteelworkersTo equitably reduce the deficit in a way that maintains good faith with the American people requires tax increases.

The answer is that if the problem is schools, then we don\u0027t have to think about all the other drivers of inequality.Read Post | Comments (547)John Pavley, 01/26/13CTO @ The Huffington Post, BloggerI personally do not believe the U.S. Government is controlled by shadowy figures lurking behind a smoke smoke screen of faux democracy. If anything, the political and social events of the last few years are evidence that no one is ultimately \"in control\" and that every player is each equally frustrated.Read Post | Comments (432)Sally Osberg, 01/28/13CEO, Skoll FoundationSolving the American job crisis needs us all: business, government, and the non-profit sector.

Patty Murray, 01/28/13U.S. Senator from WashingtonThe budget process and conversation is too often limited to bureaucrats and politicians. The truth is that the federal budget belongs to the American people. That\u0027s why I am proud to announce the launch of MyBudget, a new online platform for members of the public to engage with the Senate Budget Committee.Read Post | Comments (238)Timothy P. Shriver, 01/28/13Chairman of Special OlympicsIn the global Special Olympics family, we too are seeing the emergence of dynamic leaders who are all Special Olympics athletes.

Patton, 01/28/13Dean of Arts and Sciences at Duke UniversityEven with progress in education, violence against women has not abated.
