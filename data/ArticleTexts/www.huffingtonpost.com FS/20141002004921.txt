{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Director, Arms and Security Project, Center for International PolicyAdvocacy Director, Win Without WarIf there\u0027s one thing we should have learned over the past 13 years of war, it\u0027s that war is good business for those in the business of war. Unfortunately, while profits for the Pentagon\u0027s contractors increase, so does the cost to taxpayers in billions in waste, fraud, and abuse. As America embarks on yet another war in the Middle East, Congress needs to act now to stop this unjustified bonanza for the Pentagon\u0027s contractors. The most recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan offer an ominous example about what can happen when the rush to war is met with sharp spending increases coupled with little to no oversight or fiscal restraint.A few weeks ago, as Ebola slipped down the world\u0027s list of priorities, I woke up in the middle of the night knowing I had to do something, in whatever way I could, to help fight the spread of this virus.Actor, musician and producerWhat is the end goal? Total occupation of Ukraine is doubtful as it would result in a civil war and an economic collapse, which is already underway with oligarchs still functioning despite the ouster of the corrupt president, Viktor Yanukovich. Or is a land link to Crimea the objective?Veteran journalist reporting from the United NationsHis failure to strike a balance between his justifiable resistance to the occupation and the need to rally the support of the Israeli public was a major blunder, deeply injurious to the Palestinian cause.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUPeople with mental illness are some of the most marginalized and stigmatized people in our society. And as a result, many people are forced into silence about their illness. Many don\u0027t seek out help even though they are suffering, sometimes with dire consequences.Peer Life Coach, Trainer of Mental Health Professionals, Mental Health Advocate, Person In RecoveryThe gridlock in Washington - where Congress hasn\u0027t boosted the federal minimum wage, stuck at $7.25 an hour, since 2009 - has catalyzed a growing movement in cities and states. Nineteen states now have minimum wages over $7.25 an hour.E.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeThe White House has acknowledged for the first time that the strict standards President Obama imposed last year to prevent civilian deaths from U.S. drone strikes will not apply to U.S. military operations in Syria and Iraq. This is a tragic error.Professor of Theology, Chicago Theological SeminaryThe goal of business in aggressively promoting CCSS while bashing the teaching profession into false, test-score-riddled \"accountability\" is to reshape the purpose of education into streamlined, assemly-line-to-market service.Public school teacher, education activist, PhDBefore the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, MO, recedes in the rear-view mirror, let\u0027s be straight with ourselves about what the events surrounding his death tell us about race in America.Professor of Psychology and Education in the Department of Counseling and Clinical Psychology at Teachers College, Columbia UniversityThe diagnosis of any chronic illness comes with much you wish you didn\u0027t have to carry, and suffer with, for the rest of your life. Your chronic illness also teaches you many great things that offer enormous reward in life, and sometimes it\u0027s good to take a moment to acknowledge this brighter side of your existence.\"Is that shirt supposed to be funny?\" she asked motioning to my satirical \"Caucasians\" T-shirt. And then she said, \"I\u0027ll f*cking cut you.\" This is the part you don\u0027t really see in its full glory on the segment.Writer, producer, and member of the 1491s, a sketch comedy groupIt is easy to talk about introverts and extroverts as if there is a clear divide between two groups of people. It is easy to take a test and pigeonhole ourselves as one or the other. In reality, we ignore the power of the situation.Professor of Psychology, George Mason UniversityIf this bothers you -- as it should -- look. Think. Research. Donate if you can. Spread the word. Share. I don\u0027t want any other parent to know firsthand what pediatric cancer looks like.Blogger, Kissing The FrogThe British government is still fighting case after case concerning allegations of abuses by its forces during the 2003 Iraq conflict. This month it had a rare victory. The European Court of Human Rights found no human rights violations by the United Kingdom in the detention and death of a 22-year-old football player in Iraq in 2003.Senior legal advisor, Human Rights WatchWhile the threat of ISIL is real, Muslims in America should not collectively pay the price every time an individual or group engages in political violence in the name of Islam. Overtly targeting Muslims only corroborates what many Americans have suspected for decades -- systemic bias against minorities infects law enforcement.Associate Professor, Texas A\u0026M University School of LawKale can be grown virtually anywhere, and unlike its fair-weather friends, kale grows right through winter\u0027s frost. I\u0027ve grown kale plants on a roof deck in Greenwich Village and harvested it for salads in January.Psychiatrist, Author, Farmer Assistant Clinical Professor of Psychiatry, Columbia UniversityTo commemorate Banksy\u0027s very successful offering to the city and the excitement that ensued with its inhabitants we decided to put together a series of messages left out for him on walls, doors, trucks and fences.Co-Founders, BrooklynStreetArt.comThere has always been a vast gulf between those who practice politics and those who practice war. Part of that divide is defined by who\u0027s doing hands-dirty, grueling, up-all-night work.Senior Military Correspondent, The Huffington PostA big part of this running thing is mental, so be confident in the foods you use to fuel your feet. Stop thinking \"diet\" and start thinking \"nutrition.\" You can certainly try someone else\u0027s running meal plan that appeals to you, but empower yourself to make it your own.Living a Nutritious Life \u0026 inspiring you to live yours! Upwave nutritionist \u0026 Women\u0027s Health magazine Contributor.For years, opponents of medical marijuana have claimed that California\u0027s medical marijuana law is a giant con job. But now the data are in, and they suggest that medical marijuana is used by a wide variety of people in California with an almost unheard of success rate.California Policy Manager, Drug Policy AllianceWe\u0027ll never know for sure exactly what goes into these foods and drinks.TheDailyMeal.comJust like school districts had to do with segregation in Brown v. Board of Education, the NFL should have to explain why it\u0027s OK to treat Natives different than every other race.Author, attorney, and member of the Blackfeet Nation and Suquamish territoriesIf a condition, even Ebola, threatens your life, be courageous, be informed, and be prepared to make a decision that could help you survive.Practicing hematologist and medical oncologistOn Fox News a Muslim who killed a co-worker in Oklahoma and who remains in police custody represents a much bigger story than a suspected anti-government assassin who killed a cop and remains on the run, eluding hundreds of law enforcement officials while terrorizing a Pennsylvania community.Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaOne year ago today, Republicans made their strongest possible case outlining their governing principles. Threatened by the prospect of millions of Americans securing access to quality, affordable health care, Republicans chose instead to shut down the federal government.Author, \u0027For the Next Generation\u0027; Chair, Democratic National CommitteeThough they like to invoke patriotic themes and drape themselves in the flag, the oil barons have persistently demonstrated their enthusiasm for putting corporate profits ahead of the public welfare.President, Waterkeeper Alliance; Senior Attorney, NRDCSlang does not exist to comfort the afflicted nor to make anyone feel \"better.\" There is no feel-good factor (other, perhaps, than the masturbatory). Its role is to afflict the comfortable. It is a vote for the disenfranchised. Or possibly those who simply eschew the polls.Author, \u0027Green\u0027s Dictionary of Slang\u0027Research -- and research alone -- has the power to be the end of breast cancer. Investing in research produces results. It\u0027s just that simple.President, BCRFThe Occupy Movement has returned and is resurrecting itself in Hong Kong. But in this case, the \"occupying\" is not associating itself with the Occupy Wall Street of recent years.Ph.D., Associate Director for Legislative Affairs, Friends Committee on National LegislationTake advantage of the #1 rule of air travel: no matter what time it is, it\u0027s always acceptable to drink.Overheard inside the elevators of Goldman SachsWe have to teach our children (and ourselves) that caution is often a sign of courage.
