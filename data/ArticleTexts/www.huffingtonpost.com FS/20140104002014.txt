{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureWhy are we arguing about hypothetical futures and ignoring the very real present? We\u0027re still in a situation where the \"multiplier effect\" -- the amount of growth which can be achieved through government spending -- is very high. The situation cries out for higher taxation on the wealthy and corporations, coupled with investment in jobs and growth. In other words, it calls out for the very same policies which would reduce inequality. In the end it\u0027s one challenge, not two or three. So let\u0027s stop arguing about which issue to focus upon. It\u0027s the same fundamental challenge, no matter how you look at it, so why not work on fixing it instead?Comments (90)TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"To kick off the New Year, TEDWeekends is proud to present a compilation of six insanely popular TED Talks from our 2013 programming. These talks inspired a tremendous amount of engagement from our community last year, and each one provides valuable insight that will help you get the most out of life in 2014.CommentsBob CescaManaging Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowThis is absolutely indicative of what\u0027s become of online journalism. The mad scramble for both content and clicks has overtaken integrity, reality and the truth.Comments (11)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarWhat happens when a generation said to be far less conspicuous in its consumption confronts human nature? The personal growth and fulfillment at the top Maslow\u0027s Hierarchy of Needs occupies the floor just above esteem -- defined by status, achievement and reputation.CommentsJim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027This past year taught me so much about the gospel and caused me to go deeper into my faith. As this new year begins, here are five spiritual resolutions I learned from last year.CommentsGeoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoThe central question posed by the bulk telephony meta-data program is this: Is the government\u0027s collection of an individual\u0027s telephone call records from the individual\u0027s telephone service provider a \"search\" of that individual within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment?CommentsMiho KubagawaBirmingham, AL native working in the education sector in NYCFor the first time in my life, I actually stuck to my New Year\u0027s resolution for 2013. My friends did too and we\u0027re already discussing what we\u0027re going to focus on for 2014. What sparked the change?CommentsMarian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundHis commitment as a leader to South Africa\u0027s children was the extension of a principle that has governed leaders of traditional communities for generations: If the children are well, then all of us are well.CommentsMark GongloffChief financial writer, The Huffington PostBreaking news: The Wall Street Journal editorial page is full of it. OK, that\u0027s not really news. But an unusually flagrant example of the WSJ editorial page\u0027s hogwash artistry caught the world\u0027s eye on Thursday.Comments (2,197)Martha BurkMoney Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsThe truth is that as a country, we\u0027re getting stingier, not more generous with the poor. And the difference between the very rich and the rest of us has grown astronomically since President Johnson declared his war.Comments (17)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorYou can imagine my surprise when I received a request from a certain notorious former President of the United States asking for my financial support in his public policy center\u0027s efforts to address the \"challenges facing our world.\"Comments (104)Shelley EmlingSenior Editor, HuffPost 50It\u0027s unbelievable to me how something that was a rare perk only a few years back is now considered as indispensable as a napkin or toilet when traveling in any part of the world.Comments (14)Joe PeyronninHofstra Journalism ProfessorMuch of the country kicked off the New Year with heavy snowstorms followed by a blast of frigid cold temperatures. But for 1.3 million Americans, whose unemployment checks have been cut off, this may be the coldest winter of all.CommentsBen IrwinAuthor, bloggerWhile it\u0027s popular to think people are poor because they\u0027re lazy, the poor actually work longer and harder than the rest of us.Comments (21)William NicholsonScreenwriter, AuthorA global icon, a legend, an inspiration. How do you make a movie about such a man? The first answer, looking back, is: slowly. We didn\u0027t know at the beginning that it would take the rest of Mandela\u0027s life, and that within days of the release of the finished film he would be dead.CommentsJosh FleetFormer Associate Editor, HuffPost ReligionBefore I learned about listening in a Jewish prayer context, I learned about it in the shul of Phish. As a young fan, and amateur guitar player, theirs was an infinite well of ear-training, heart-opening music.Comments (14)Noble SmithAuthorJ.R.R. Tolkien and G.R.R. Martin have millions of devoted followers who swear that one of them is better than the other. I\u0027m a fan of both of these great storytellers, but I believe that Middle-earth will be held up as an exemplar of fantasy (and literature) long after Westeros has faded away.Comments (181)Amitai EtzioniProfessor of international relations, George Washington UniversityWill people feel better if they are promised an end to inequality but get only a haircut for the rich and a limited lift for the poor? I wonder. A fair society might be more within reach.CommentsDavid FreudbergHost of the public radio series “Humankind”In the din of polemics and punditry about health care reform, we have not heard much from one vitally important voice: that of young people now attending medical school, to whom we will entrust the future of health care.Comments (17)Terry O\u0027NeillPresident, National Organization for WomenI don\u0027t doubt that the individuals who control the Little Sisters of the Poor are entitled to religious freedom. I wish they could recognize that their First Amendment right to practice their own religion doesn\u0027t trump women\u0027s basic rights.Comments (30)Robert NaimanPolicy Director, Just Foreign PolicyNow we know that it\u0027s actually not so hard to get Washington to do the right thing if the choices are framed correctly. Having learned this lesson, let us apply it to the question of future wars, and to the proposed Iran war in particular.CommentsRev. Richard CizikPresident, The New Evangelical Partnership for the Common GoodWith my legs spread out in front of me, exhausted and in total fear, I pray repeatedly \"Lord, don\u0027t let my son die.\" EMT officials administer RCAN, but the heart monitor set up a few feet away is flat-lined. He died in my arms.CommentsCarl PopeFormer executive director and chairman, Sierra ClubClimate disruption, broadband access and crumbling bridges and roads have an odd thing in common: they have entered the never-never land of conservative denialism -- where they are simply not problems for which the right feels obliged to offer solutions.Comments (68)Lincoln Mitchelllincolnmitchell.com2013 was the year where issues of income inequality, raised by the Occupy Movement in 2011, stressed by Pope Francis and, belatedly, by President Obama finally came to the fore of American politics. It is likely they will remain there for some time to come.Comments (105)Peter DreierE.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeProgressives are rarely satisfied. It is part of our political DNA. There\u0027s so much injustice in the world, it\u0027s sometimes hard to feel that we\u0027re making progress. Let\u0027s look back at 2013 and examine 25 significant accomplishments.Comments (23)Paul SzepTwo-time Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonistCommentsChristine PelosiChair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusAs 2014 dawns, women on the run in political office and public service have multitasking ahead. How well we juggle doing it all -- home life, work life, personal space and public engagement -- may well determine the fate of our families and our nation.CommentsRichard KirschSenior Fellow, Roosevelt Institute; author of \u0027Fighting for Our Health\u0027Is the political system in the United States capable of responding to the escalating crisis of stagnant wages, shrinking benefits, dissolving economic opportunity, and disappearing hopes of living anything that resembles the American Dream? It is a question I ask myself every day.CommentsJordan K. TurgeonLifestyle Blog Editor, The Huffington PostMy compulsive checking had become a burden instead of a fun way to keep in touch. I wanted to live a better, more present life, and in order to do that I had to stop bombarding myself with information on how everyone else was living theirs.Comments (21)Eric RobergeCertified Financial Planner, Founder of Beyond Your HammockIf there\u0027s one thing I\u0027d like you to take away from this story, it\u0027s this: Don\u0027t put off until someday all the things you know you should do today.
