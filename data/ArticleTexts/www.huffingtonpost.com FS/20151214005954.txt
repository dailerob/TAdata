{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week saw another brazen attack on America. The target: our values. The perpetrator: Donald Trump, who called for a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\" Along with being an assault on our bedrock beliefs, this is also a test of the media, which, after allowing Trump\u0027s ugly views to gain legitimacy, have finally begun to call him out. Perhaps it\u0027s time to resurrect the idea of the Homeric epithet, adding an obligatory descriptor to each mention of a name. Those of us raised on Greek myths can\u0027t think of Athena without our minds autocompleting with \"owl-eyed.\" Let\u0027s make sure that no one can think of Trump without their brain autocompleting with \"mendacious racist\" (Ben Smith\u0027s suggestion) or \"sexist\" or \"serial liar\" or \"birther and bully\" -- or get your Homer on and suggest your own in the comments section below.Years from now, our grandchildren will reflect on humanity\u0027s moral courage to solve the climate crisis and they will look to December 12, 2015, as the day when the community of nations finally made the decision to act.Chairman, Generation Investment Management and The Climate Reality ProjectI\u0027m glad we\u0027ve begun to raise our daughters more like our sons -- but it will never work until we raise our sons more like our daughters.When historians look back on this day, they will say that global cooperation to secure a future safe from climate change took a dramatic new turn here in Paris.Secretary-General, United NationsChoosing to invest in others when everyone and everything is telling you to continue investing in yourself and your career shows strength of character and a willingness to live your principles. Why can\u0027t we learn to evaluate the success of a life, or even of a career, as a blend of money and meaning, of both climbing a ladder of accomplishment and building a web of relationships? We can, of course.President and CEO, New America; Author, Unfinished Business: Women, Men, Work, FamilyOn the heels of Trump\u0027s proposed change for America, we will be changing how we cover him at The Huffington Post. Back in July, we announced our decision to put our coverage of Trump\u0027s presidential campaign in our Entertainment section instead of our Politics section. \"Trump\u0027s campaign is a sideshow.\" Since then Trump\u0027s campaign has certainly lived up to that billing. But as today\u0027s vicious pronouncement makes abundantly clear, it\u0027s also morphed into something else: an ugly and dangerous force in American politics.Because of his notoriety and the ratings it garners, the media grants Trump credibility and constant coverage of his continued falsehoods and ugly assaults against those whom he has named as enemies -- who are mostly people of color.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersDear Father Christmas, So my friend has asked me to write to you... I have to confess it\u0027s been hard to know what to say. Mainly because like most adults I feel preposterous asking anything of you because our time with you is surely done. Now we get our own presents, control our own fates, take responsibility for our own actions, and live in the world we have created...ActorClimate change is not the only crisis we face. We also face a crisis of joblessness. Of inequality. Of racial and gender injustice. So when we talk about climate solutions in this context, it has to be about designing and then fighting for integrated solutions, ones that radically bring down emissions while simultaneously building more just economies and democracies based on true equality.Author, This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. The ClimateI have chosen show business to be my religion. It is so full of non-competitive compassionate souls who care about others with full empathy. That is meant to be sarcastic. I thought I learned when I wrote my book Dirty Daddy that sarcasm does not travel in print. One step forward, two steps back.Comedian and actorAppointed by President Bill Clinton, I took my oath of office to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States of America with my hands on the Quran atop my wife\u0027s Bible. It was one of the proudest moments of my life. I carried the American flag with dignity, honor and distinction.United States Ambassador from 1999-2001The loss of confidence in government, fostered by many in government, is a more serious threat to American security than ISIS. There is no American alive today who can destroy confidence in our government and expect to restore it by being elected.United States Senator (Ret.)The new Every Student Succeeds Act begins a new era, but it is one without needed federal accountability and with the hopes that states will fulfill their crucial responsibility to educate all their children fairly and prepare them for work and life.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundFor me, football was a lifeline. And for many other NFL players, it was a lifeline. If it wasn\u0027t for football, a lot of us would be dead, or lost, roaming the streets somewhere. With all due respect, Dr. Omalu, football doesn\u0027t give us an opportunity to play a game. It gives us a chance at life.NFL wide receiver; Co-founder, PROJECT 375Among those who founded our nation were those fleeing religious persecution. It goes against those basic American ideals to close our doors to visitors and immigrants based on their religion. It is deeply regrettable that this even needs to be said.Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee; Ranking Member, Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations and Related ProgramsWhat would cause someone to turn his or her back on family, friends, and Western comforts to commit horrific crimes and risk their own deaths? What would be the reason we\u0027re seeing a steady stream of young people traveling to the Middle East to join jihadists, including a growing number of young women and girls?Author, research psychologist and gender scholarWe will probably never be able to solve the gun issue in America, and we will continue to kill one another with a greater frequency than any civilized nation on Earth. We have a law, our second amendment right, so goes the cry. If people get shot to death, so be it. After all, we must obey and respect that amendment, that\u0027s what we hear over and over again.Academy Award-winning director, screenwriter and producerIf Donald Trump is elected President, it will be my fault. Your fault. Your neighbor\u0027s fault. Your co-worker\u0027s fault. American voters have the opportunity to do something about this. Instead of rolling our eyes and changing the subject because it seems absurd, local communities need to recognize the hate he is stirring and act now.Vice President, Strategy \u0026 External Affairs, The Bromwich Group. Views expressed are her own.There are many ways to look at the climate deal coming out of Paris. We can identify with both those who criticize its lack of ambition, and those who are desperate to celebrate its success. Because the real outcome of the agreement isn\u0027t contained in the text, but what comes after.Co-founder and Communications Director, 350.orgDespite the apparent inability of many of our current policy makers to accept the scientific reality of climate change, the science is not new.President, Pacific InstituteSanders is a fearless, experienced leader capable of seeing the truth, and standing up to big private power, even when its almost impossibly hard. President Sanders would always keep the humble, struggling, proud citizen at the center of what he does.CEO of MAYDAY.US, Associate Law Professor at Fordham, Corruption ScholarDuring the 14 years between the horrific but flukish events of 9/11 and last week\u0027s massacre in San Bernardino, there had been just six civilians killed on American soil by jihadist oriented terrorists. Two were killed at the El Al counter at LAX airport in 2002 and four at the Boston Marathon attacks in 2013.Author, \u0027The Great Deformation: The Corruption of Capitalism in America\u0027Donald Trump\u0027s bigotry is not only dominating the news cycle and winning Trump Republican primary votes. It\u0027s directly trickling into to new legislation that Congress is currently considering -- legislation that will effectively create two classes of Americans.President, National Iranian American CouncilThis is about all of us. It\u0027s not about Muslims versus Christians. Or conservatives versus liberals. Or East versus West. This is not any one country\u0027s war. This is every country\u0027s war.Hashemite Kingdom of JordanMuch of the discussion about health in recent years has focused on new medications and technologies, expanded insurance coverage, and improved quality of care. What also demands attention is a fundamental building block of health that millions of Americans are lacking: food.Surgeon General of the United StatesI\u0027m not angry. I\u0027m not even worried. When I watched him say that no Muslims should be allowed in the United States until we \"figure out what the hell is going on\" I felt....relieved. And actually kind of grateful.Truman National Security Fellow and civil servant; first-generation American and former translator for U.S. troops; proud Hoya. Always busy countering extremism.The double standard can\u0027t be more jarring: For days television networks and media outlets have been parroting the FBI in telling us how the San Bernadino shooters were \"radicalized\" at this or that time, or speculating on their \"radicalization\" and how it occurred.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostThe venerable George Shultz, Ronald Reagan\u0027s Secretary of State, and arguably one of the most distinguished public servants in post-­World War II America, uses \"mugged by reality\" to describe what he thinks of the current crop of presidential candidates in his beloved Republican Party refusing to believe in the reality of global climate change.President, News and Guts MediaThough I did face life-threatening dangers while in the military, I was never shot at. In fact, that didn\u0027t happen until after I got out of the service and it was done by one of the very citizens whose rights I sacrificed 11 years of my life to defend. That was the first time I faced the nightmare of surviving the military only to be nearly killed by those I swore to protect.Comic book enthusiast, actor, artist, writer, and veteranWe are four million Syrian refugees scattered across lands of exile. Affected individuals, suffering deep within themselves. We have been hunted and hounded, forced to build a new life in the midst of an alien and harsh reality.We are non-violent Syrian activists campaigning to engage people around the world in solidarity to stop the violence and extremism in Syria.While those promoting the TPP trade deal said it would advance workers in member nations and allow the formation of unions, the actual language in the agreement offers only false promises of progress. That, in turn, would negatively impact domestic manufacturing.General President, International Brotherhood of TeamstersInternational President, United SteelworkersPresident, United Auto WorkersGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
