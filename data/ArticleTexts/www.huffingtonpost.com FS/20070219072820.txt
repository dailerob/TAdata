{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"APAPyahoo.comamazon.comAny time President Bush holds a press conference, odds are high that a strong contender for the week\u0027s most ludicrous quote will crop up. This week\u0027s strangely light-hearted presidential presser was no exception. First there was his utter disbelief over questions about the accuracy of his administration\u0027s intelligence on Iran providing explosives to Iraq: \"The idea that somehow we\u0027re manufacturing the idea that Iranians are providing IEDs is preposterous.\" Preposterous indeed -- where would anyone ever get an idea like that from? Then came Bush\u0027s claim that he can\u0027t judge whether Iraq is a civil war while \"living in this beautiful White House.\" His lovely surroundings didn\u0027t keep him from judging that he needed to order up another 21,500 troops did they? It would be downright comical, if it wasn\u0027t so bloody tragic.READ POST | RELATED02.15.2007 Lawrence O\u0027DonnellLibby is guilty. And he\u0027s going to be found guilty.
