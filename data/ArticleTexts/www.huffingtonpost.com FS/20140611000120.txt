There are a bit less than 80,000 workers directly employed in the coal industry. A large percentage of these jobs will be lost in the next 15 years due to these regulations. While it is good to see the media paying attention to this job loss and its implications for families and communities, this concern is a striking departure from normal practice. This was demonstrated clearly last week when the Commerce Department reported a large jump in the trade deficit for April. The report, and the implied job loss, received almost no attention from the media.The US has been at war nearly nonstop since the Vietnam War began. That\u0027s more than half a century of experience with war, American-style, and yet few in our world bother to draw the obvious conclusions.Editor, TomDispatch.comThis is the America of the 21st century, a country divided along lines of morality, where wealth equates to power and the gap between those who have and those who don\u0027t is increasing. I will continue to speak up for those who aren\u0027t able to speak up for themselves.Community activist and studentIn the ALEC otherworld, actual economics do not count. It\u0027s all about a business-friendly environment. Hello, Third World.Wisconsin State RepresentativeThe Millers\u0027 involvement in Bunkerville should be a glaring red flag to every American who cares about the democratic principles of government established by our Constitution. It should also be a wake-up call to our government.Executive Director, Coalition to Stop Gun ViolenceOn too many occasions, politics and vested interests have trumped the solid scientific evidence we need to help make decisions at the state and federal level. Here, from the Got Science desk, is a roundup of the month\u0027s top five reasons it\u0027s high time to stand up for science.Senior Staff Writer, Union of Concerned ScientistsAt the end of the day, Free The Nipple has only one clear-cut mission: to bring \"America The Beautiful\" the \"Land Of The Free\" into the 21st century.Director, \u0027Free the Nipple\u0027Somebody should tell the administration: This is about 60,000 defrauded service members. It\u0027s about all the other student loan holders who are being placed at the mercy of executives. And it\u0027s about the \"bipartisan\" obsession with privatization at any cost, even if it means sacrificing innocent people on the altar of profit.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourThe NRA\u0027s notion that we are a much safer country now that residents of every state can apply for a concealed carry guns falls flat on its face, even when we look at the data that the NRA uses to prove its own case.Mike the Gun GuyThe summer before his death, I asked him what he loved about sunset. He said: \"If you\u0027ve had a rotten day, sunset reminds you that another day is ahead. If you\u0027ve had a great day, sunset reminds you to soak it in. Either way, it\u0027s a win.\"Child and Adolescent Psychotherapist, Parenting ExpertIt\u0027s increasingly clear that entrusting decisions involving medical science to the DEA is akin to leaving the fox in charge of the henhouse. And what\u0027s most striking is how little scrutiny the DEA has faced from Congress or other federal overseers.Executive Director, Drug Policy AllianceExecutive Director, Multidisciplinary Association for Psychadelic StudiesMaybe there is some risk in overzealously documenting our lives. There are certainly times to put that camera away and join in the fun. But these findings suggest that there may also be risk in failing to create mementos. The seemingly dull and quotidian details of our everyday lives may be the emotional treasures of the future.Author, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027For more insight into what is (and is not) football, and why so many people care so very much, here are some titles to guide you through the coming month of games.ABC News producer and reporterA few days ago I was walking near my apartment when a swarm of young men and women whooshed by me. They were all wearing long robes and holding their mortarboard hats fast to their heads, as they rushed in the direction of our neighborhood school.\"Hurry!\" I heard one say to the others, laughing. \"We can\u0027t be late for our own graduation!\"Award-winning actress, author and activistNew York as it stands today is antithetical to many of the ideals that drive people to move there.Media strategistI cannot fathom why the UK government is not denouncing the Sri Lankan government\u0027s atrocities. Why are they not demanding that the perpetrators be brought to justice? Why are they deporting survivors of torture and rape back to Sri Lanka, and endangering their lives?Founder and Chair, Bianca Jagger Human Rights FoundationRecently, a video about a transgender child in California went viral. Sadly, like every other conversation about transgender children, the comments section was often unkind. Scanning the comments, I saw the same poorly thought-out ideas keep popping up. I think it\u0027s time to put these misconceptions to bed.Director of Advocacy, SPART*AToo many people worship guns instead of God. Still, Jesus and the disciples were stronger then all the Roman Empire two thousand years ago. The Cross lobby will still prevail against the gun lobby.United Church of Christ ministerI cannot alter everything, and I cannot bend to every whim. There just has to be limits.Chef/RestaurateurGrowing up, if I wanted to play catch, I often had to play it alone. Sometimes I\u0027d even aim at a tree for lack of person with a glove at the other end of the yard.U.S. Secretary of TransportationHer friends will tell you, \"She\u0027s a fantastic friend. Always there for you when you need her.\" Strangely enough, they don\u0027t seem to know what kind of deeper issues she might have.Clinical Psychologist, Mental Health/Midlife BloggerAs if it weren\u0027t enough that some of the Republican Party\u0027s leaders were breaking with the party on this issue, now their loudest talking point is being undermined by the very people the Republican Party pretends to speak for in its opposition to raising the minimum wage: businesses and large corporations.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorNot too long ago in our recent past there used to be TV shows -- entertainment, we called it -- and we also had the news. More serious, not worthy of high ratings -- informative, you might say. Now we have entertaining news, not entertainment news like Entertainment Tonight, but a soap opera version of the news.Academy Award-winning director, screenwriter and producerThe point here is that something as subtle and powerful as human emotion is coming \"digitally online.\" It\u0027s being digitized and understood and monitored and commercialized. And you should know about it.Chairman/CEO, XPRIZEWhile styling themselves as defenders of the constitution and protectors of individual rights, hardline GOPers, in practice, protect their own power and position by violating the Constitution and denying individuals their rights. Just take North Carolina for example.International President, United SteelworkersSince I am almost 40 now -- God, I love saying that -- I finally know what beauty is. To me, beauty is the beach near my house, puttering around my kitchen, the laughter of a good friend, my dogs\u0027 stinky fur, Amma\u0027s inability to say the letter R, Tish\u0027s sensitive heart, Chase\u0027s darkening summer skin against his ultra white teeth, Craig playing hide and seek by himself, the steeple of my beloved church, a hot chai tea, and the banyan trees in my front yard. Today I will FILL UP WITH THIS BEAUTY.Bestselling Author, Carry On, Warrior and Founder of MomasteryLatinos, like me, rewarded Obama with our vote. In 2008: because he warmed our hearts. In 2012: because we believed his second term would free him to get immigration reform done, regardless of Republican obstructionism. But the hope he inspired has spiraled into hopelessness.Actor, ACLU Ambassador for Immigrants RightsWe\u0027ve gone through the tips and photos from the minube travel community to find these 21 drops of pure, unadulterated freshwater goodness.

For us, the question changes from \"how do I present my best self at work?\" to \"can I present my best self at work?\"Queer activist, movement organizer, and part-time fashion iconGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"CANTOR COOKED?",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
