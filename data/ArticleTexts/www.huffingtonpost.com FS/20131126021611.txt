{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Marty KaplanDirector, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolSo where are we in the Iran narrative? I mean no disrespect to the victims of Iran\u0027s terrorist clients, or the existential fears of Israelis and world Jewry, or U.S. security interests in the Middle East by calling it a narrative. Real events do happen in the real world, but people can\u0027t help trying to fit them into larger stories. We love to connect the dots. Storytelling isn\u0027t some atavistic remnant of our pre-scientific past; it\u0027s how our brains are hardwired. When no one knows what comes next, the political advantage goes to the most powerful narrators. When no one knows how things will end up, the same events can be construed as signposts toward tragedy or triumph. The Geneva deal may turn out to advance America\u0027s Middle East interests; it may be a historic blunder; it may make no difference.CommentsGeorge LakoffAuthor, \u0027The Political Mind,\u0027 \u0027Moral Politics\u0027 and \u0027Don\u0027t Think of an Elephant!\u0027The NY Times has many virtues and some important flaws.

GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersThis Thanksgiving will be very different for too many American workers. They won\u0027t share in the bounty they helped create.Comments (170)Linda TiradoNight Cook, Essayist, ActivistComing up with enough money that you are comfortable is the real American dream, and it is one that the people I am used to don\u0027t believe in as much as hope hard for. I have spent my life on the margins due to my own actions and an equal amount of things that I cannot control.Comments (514)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkDiversity is one of the greatest strengths of this nation, and we must respect one another in a way that preserves and further develops this diversity. Therefore, when an injustice happens to anyone, it is the duty of all to speak up. Silence is akin to tacit acceptance.CommentsSheila MoeschenSenior Editor I AM THAT GIRL, Freelance writer\"What about Thanksgiving?\" you cry in rage. Where is Thanksgiving\u0027s contribution to the expanding sexualization of holidays?

Here\u0027s why.Comments (11)Dr. Josef OlmertAdjunct Professor, University of South CarolinaA realignment of Middle East politics? That remains to be seen, but it is more likely than before with the signing of the agreement, and one with potential effects that could go beyond the immediate Iranian connection.Comments (35)Sarah BarnessWriter, Artist ExtraordinaireDear Doctor: You had me at, \"I\u0027m not a ginger.\" When you open that blue door, my heart beats louder than the two of yours combined, because I have a problem that only a doctor can solve.

Families, they just do that to you sometimes, you know?Comments (18)Matt WalshBlogger, talk radio host, father of twinsThat\u0027s our entire economic system: buy things. Everybody buy. It doesn\u0027t matter what you buy. Just buy. How appropriate, then, that a holiday created by our ancestors as an occasion to give thanks for what they had, now morphs into a frenzied consumerist ritual where we descend upon shopping malls to accumulate more things we don\u0027t need.Comments (1,283)Conde Nast TravelerCondeNastTraveler.comOf the 981 properties included on UNESCO\u0027s World Heritage List, some 44 are categorized as in-danger, for reasons ranging from political instability to irresponsible tourism.CommentsBelle Beth CooperContent crafter, BufferIf you\u0027re managing social media for your business, it might be useful to know about some of the most surprising social media statistics this year.
