{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"The Mayans turned out to be wrong about the end of the world, but there was still a lot of gloom this week as we watched the procession of funerals for victims of the Newtown shooting. On Thursday alone, services were held for four six-year-olds and one seven-year-old. In an attempt at establishing some normalcy for those kids who survived, officials are recreating their classrooms at a nearby school, right down to the art on the walls and the placement of desks and backpacks. That\u0027s good for the children; the rest of us need the exact opposite. We need to break the all-too familiar routine of gun-victim funerals and leaders who helplessly throw up their hands. On Wednesday, the president announced that Joe Biden would lead a task force on gun violence. It\u0027s a step in the right direction, but only if it results in legislation that makes a week of wrenching funerals begin to seem utterly unfamiliar.Read Post | Comments (20)Mohamed A. El-Erian, 12/21/12CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOIn order to avoid a recession that would aggravate the country\u0027s unemployment problem and reignite concerns about housing and household finances, Democrats and Republicans need quickly to find a way to work together. While possible, it is hard to see how this happens endogenously.Read Post | Comments (127)Cory Booker, 12/21/12Mayor of NewarkHere are gun law reforms that alone will save thousands upon thousands of Americans, and joined with other reasonable reforms, can truly turn the tide on gun violence in this country.Read Post | Comments (786)Arianna Huffington, 12/17/12Mass shootings have become a defining feature of modern America. Yet on the issue of gun violence, President Obama has shown a gift for eloquent rhetoric but no follow-through.Read Post | Comments (1,609)Glenn Close, 12/20/12Emmy, Golden Globe and Tony Award winning actressA tragedy like Sandy Hook can tend to solidify people\u0027s fears and prejudices about mental illness. So it is of vital importance that we, as a community, re-dedicate ourselves to eliminating the stigma that affects 1 in 4 people in our country.Read Post | Comments (158)Sean Penn, 12/20/12Academy Award-winning Actor; Ambassador-at-Large for HaitiI have had a front row seat to many of our State Department\u0027s diplomatic efforts and can offer unequivocally as one American voice, enormous pride and gratitude for this administration\u0027s extraordinary Department of State.

Kennedy Center for Justice and Human RightsI was eight when we lost my father Robert Kennedy to a man with a gun. I can\u0027t begin to know what these days have been like for the families of Newtown. But I know that for loved ones left behind, some wounds may be healed by time, but there are others for which there is no cure but to take action.Read Post | Comments (463)Jim Wallis, 12/21/12Christian leader for social changeToday, I challenge our political leaders to read the Christmas story of God come to earth and born in a manger as a child of working-class parents, and then reexamine their own budget priorities.Read Post | Comments (24)Jane Smiley, 12/18/12Pulitzer Prize-Winning Novelist and EssayistIt\u0027s pretty clear when you think about it that gun lovers have used the 2nd Amendment not only to threaten us, and in some cases to kill us, but also to mooch off of us -- they have their fun, and we pay. That part has got to stop. You can have your guns, but you have responsibilities.Read Post | Comments (2,937)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 12/22/12Author, research psychologist and gender scholarThis year, remind yourself that you do a lot for your children every single day. Keep your efforts turned inward, and resist the temptation to use others\u0027 experiences as personal motivation even when it seems like everyone else is giving their kid the perfect holiday.Read Post | CommentsSen. Claire McCaskill, 12/20/12U.S. Senator from MissouriI\u0027m a former Jackson County prosecutor who\u0027s seen gun violence. And more importantly, I\u0027m a mom and a grandmother. And I\u0027m delivering a message to the NRA this week: Come to the table to prevent this from happening ever again.Read Post | Comments (341)Ralph Nader, 12/21/12Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorSpreading \"joy with toys\" is a major part of what the holidays in America have become -- selling directly to children, without respect to limits, boundaries or even common decency. While completely shielding a child from rampant commercialization isn\u0027t easy, there are still ways to protect the essential blessings of childhood.Read Post | Comments (70)Marlo Thomas, 12/21/12Award-winning actress, author and activistWinter time can be wonderful. But when the sun has been hiding for weeks on end and you\u0027re cooped up in the house, it\u0027s easy to go stir crazy -- I know I do. Rather than slipping into a winter funk, use these dark days as an opportunity to get organized, get motivated and try your hand at something new.Read Post | Comments (60)Lisa Belkin, 12/17/12Senior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, The Huffington PostParents can\u0027t hide anymore either. There is nothing left to conjure from our desperate imaginations that separates our children from the ones who were dropped off for just another day of school Friday morning. There is no way to blame their parents here. So we have to blame ourselves.Read Post | Comments (155)Jeffrey Sachs, 12/18/12Director, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \u0027The Price of Civilization\u0027The Second Amendment is a relic of the founding era more than two centuries ago.

That\u0027s a job best left to critics. However, in the case of Zero Dark Thirty, about the hunt for Osama bin Laden, an issue that is central to the film -- torture -- is so important that I feel I must say something.Read Post | Comments (155)Gordon Brown, 12/21/12Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationPressure is mounting on the Indian Parliament to end child labor after 150,000 Indians signed an abolition petition demanding an immediate change in the child labor laws.Read Post | CommentsHeidi Grant Halvorson, Ph.D., 12/17/12Motivational psychologist and author, \u0027Succeed\u0027 and \"Nine Things Successful People Do Differently\"The difference between those who are successful and those who aren\u0027t is not whether or not you suffer from stress, but how you deal with it when you do.

Our politicians could at least risk their campaign donations.Read Post | Comments (171)Marian Wright Edelman, 12/21/12President, Children\u0027s Defense FundInstead of responding by saying no to the culture of violence, we are apparently responding by arming ourselves with more weapons. If that cycle of violence and fear is having such a deep psychological impact on adults, how do we expect our children to navigate or survive it?Read Post | Comments (358)Riddhi Shah, 12/20/12Editor, HuffPost Good NewsWe need to ask what secrets of patriarchy we all hide within us. We may not all be sexually violent but we are products of a society that insidiously and systemically promotes the denigration of women.Read Post | Comments (182)Geoffrey R. Stone, 12/19/12Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoEconomists estimate that the average life is \"worth\" appoximately $7 million.

Keith Ellison and Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva, 12/18/12We join millions of other Americans, and the community of Newtown, in grief for the families of the children and adults killed on Friday.

We know how it feels. How big it\u0027s getting.

It\u0027s something I have heard many times before.Read Post | Comments (277)Tavis Smiley, 12/17/12PBS talk show host, PRI radio hostThe lost lives at Sandy Hook Elementary School have something to say to the entire nation, but especially to black America.
