{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Reuters/Cpl. Heidi E. LoredoHappy New Year\u0027s weekend. I got a jump on the end-of-year festivities last week with my two-part look at all the things I want to forget from 2005 (click here and here). Now it\u0027s our HuffPost bloggers\u0027 turn to weigh in -- offering up their memories of \u002705, New Year\u0027s resolutions, and predictions for the coming year. I\u0027m still working on my personal New Year\u0027s resolutions, but here are three I\u0027d like to hear George Bush make: \"Next time the mother of a slain soldier camps out in a ditch outside my ranch, I\u0027ll meet with her right away\"; \"Next time a Cat 5 storm destroys a major American city, and my point man is more worried about the way his clothes look than helping the victims, I won\u0027t say he\u0027s doing a \u0027heck of a job\u0027\"; and \"No more equating loyalty with competence. Sorry, Harriet.\"READ POST | comments (19)12.31.2005 Nora EphronI resolve that I will install a television set in the Oval Office and turn it on and watch in the event of a natural disaster.READ POST | comments (22)12.31.2005 Paul ReiserThe good news? We get a brand new, spanking fresh Year. The bad news? They gave us one last year, and look what happened.READ POST | comments (15)12.31.2005 Bill MaherI would take some pride in saying \"I told you so\" to the people who just this year realized what a bonehead Bush is, but it was so fucking obvious from the beginning that I just can\u0027t!READ POST | comments (70)12.31.2005 Bob CescaDick Cheney will construct an overly-elaborate supervillain laser wood chipper contraption into which he\u0027ll feed poor people, the elderly, Constitutional scholars, and kittens.READ POST | comments12.31.2005 Alec BaldwinA Democratic Senate, and its influence on what may also be a diminished Republican majority in the House, will lead to Cheney\u0027s impeachment.READ POST | comments (46)12.31.2005 Nick Hornby5) Maynard\u0027s Sours: Were they this year? It doesn\u0027t matter. Anyway, they combine the sugar crusts of fruit pastilles with the sourness of wine gums. Is this wasted on an American readership? That doesn\u0027t matter either. Genius.READ POST | comments12.31.2005 Jeremy PikserThat\u0027s it. I was thinking of adding \"Lose 20 pounds\" and \"battle my \u0027Law and Order\u0027 addiction,\" but why not stick to things that are at least remotely possible?READ POST | comments12.31.2005 Seth Greenland10. Suspend habeas corpus and claim it is yet one more way I am just like Abraham Lincoln. 9. Stop mincing words. Call Democrats traitors (they are!).READ POST | comments12.31.2005 David MametWorst Memories of \u002705: The evisceration of our constitutional guarantees of free speech, the right of assembly, habeas corpus, and trial by jury. But how about them White Sox?READ POST | comments12.31.2005 Jeralyn MerrittAs I reflect on 2005, very few heroes come to mind but I have no trouble conjuring up the villains.READ POST | comments (11)12.31.2005 Nicholas von HoffmanBear in mind that there is more money, attention and sex allure for weather persons when storms are forecast than when sunny days are promised, so readers may want to discount the following dark forebodings.READ POST | comments12.31.2005 Patt MorrisonI\u0027m reclaiming my cowboy boots. When I grew up, I bought my own boots. I wore them with tulle and canvas and bias-cut satin. But in 2001, when Bush unpacked his footwear in the White House, I retired mine.READ POST | comments12.31.2005 Dan CarolI hope to be less sanctimonious and judgmental in my postings about what others should do. But hey, that\u0027s next year. So check out these major demand and edicts for action now, dammit!READ POST | comments12.31.2005 Paul KrassnerI feel extremely lucky. I\u0027m unspeakably grateful to the deity I don\u0027t believe in.READ POST | comments12.31.2005 Nina BurleighBill O\u0027Reilly will cop to an oxycontin problem and go deaf. Bob Novak will embark on a civil union with a U of Maryland basketball player. Sean Hannity will take $50 million to become the Vatican\u0027s first satellite radio priest.READ POST | comments12.31.2005 Timothy NaftaliIn the spirit of season, there are some hopeful signs (in no particular order) that next year may be an improvement over this one on the national and international scene.READ POST12.31.2005 Katrina vanden HeuvelMillions of us are organizing, agitating, mobilizing--and there are many hard-fought victories to celebrate. Here are some of my favorite \"sweet victories\" of \u002705--to savor as we head into 2006.READ POST | comments12.30.2005 Susan BlumenthalAlmost without notice, 10 million children die each year before age five—but most of them don’t die in the United States.READ POST | comments12.30.2005 Trey EllisThese are exciting times we live in. This is going to be an exciting new year. Who would have thought that in 2006 Americans today would be facing the same choices that were presented to our founding fathers?READ POST | comments12.31.2005 Rob SpillmanThe mega-publishing houses lobby for their books with the muscle of the Weinstein boys working over Oscar voters.READ POST | commentsAPAPFrom iflipflop.comAPAP/J.
