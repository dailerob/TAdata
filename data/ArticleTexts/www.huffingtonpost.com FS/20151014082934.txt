{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressCasino mogul Sheldon Adelson is apparently close to deciding which candidate he\u0027ll purchase for the 2016 election, and the lucky winner looks to be Marco Rubio. It\u0027s not particularly noteworthy to witness an American politician bowing and scraping before an oddball billionaire during our nation\u0027s spin through the \"Doom Loop Of Oligarchy,\" but it is a little funny to reflect on the fact that Rubio likes to pretend he is different. \"When people give money to me, or support me, they\u0027re buying into [my] agenda, I\u0027m not buying into theirs,\" is the line that Rubio enjoys giving to voters on the stump. It\u0027s a very pretty thing to say. The only problem is that not too many people have been buying Rubio\u0027s agenda of late.The death penalty is an unusually cruel and inhumane form of punishment. It also demonstrably fails to deter crime, drug-related or otherwise. Countries carrying out executions for drug offenses simply do not register significant shifts in either supply or demand.Former minister of Social Affairs and former president of the Swiss ConfederationWe\u0027ve been through months of a GOP primary campaign that has dumbfounded the nation for it\u0027s entertaining craziness. The big takeaway from the Dem debate is that none of the candidates are crazy, that it\u0027s possible to listen as well as talk, and that American politics thrive on ideas. Boy, we needed that reminder.Senior Fellow, DemosOdeh\u0027s is an important story. A story of Palestine. A story of refugees, of military occupation and torture, of political imprisonment, of women\u0027s rights organizing, of freedom. But Odeh\u0027s must also be understood as a Black story. No one is free until everyone is free from oppression.Distinguished Professor of Africana Studies at Morehouse CollegeObama should consent to a full, independent, impartial investigation of the hospital bombing by IHFFC. If that investigation shows that war crimes probably occurred, appropriate prosecutions of the U.S. chain of command should ensue.Professor, Thomas Jefferson School of LawIt was, without question, the climax of the debate. Hillary Clinton was defending herself against email allegations, when Bernie Sanders came to her rescue. In doing so, he not only demonstrated the decency that is the hallmark of his campaign, but also proved that he\u0027s no ordinary politician.Technology Analyst at R/GADr. Ben Carson, the Republican candidate for president and former neurosurgeon, says, \"I am not politically correct. I will not be politically correct.\" This approach to his campaign has helped him secure second place in polls taken of likely Republican voters, trailing only Donald Trump. But will it play well in a national election?Hofstra Journalism ProfessorHillary Clinton won the debate hands down, with a performance so disciplined and effective that it should serve as a model for future candidates who are about to enter this rarefied arena. Against the battle-scarred veteran Hillary, the men didn\u0027t stand a chance.Professor of Journalism, Northeastern University, BostonWe don\u0027t understand why a presidential contender like Senator Bernie Sanders voted in favor of a law called the Protection of Legal Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), which gun lobbyists wrote to prevent people like us from holding gun dealers accountable in court.Parents of Aurora victim Jessica GhawiPresidential campaigns, and debates in particular, are rarely times to promote bipartisanship. But there is an issue around which both Democrats and Republicans have recently coalesced: America has put too many people behind bars -- and it\u0027s time to do something about it.Senior Counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law.Director, Justice Program, Brennan Center for Justice at NYU LawAll of my black friends have been told at some point or another during their lifetime that they \"talk white.\" The person who says it likely doesn\u0027t know many black people. Black people are generally seen as uneducated thugs. I do not appear to be an uneducated thug. Therefore, I must talk white.Actor, writer, director and hand-talkerLet\u0027s fill the gap between expectations and reality by showing that workplace equality is both possible and a priority, and ensure that women are fully empowered to press for change and unleash their potential.President of The Rockefeller FoundationCEO, Thomson Reuters FoundationLatinos in Nevada and across America will be watching the debate tonight and waiting to hear the candidates\u0027 positions on the issues that are important to our community. Given Nevada\u0027s role as one of the early caucus states, and the only one with such a large Latino community, tonight\u0027s debate will be critical.Latino Victory ProjectThe opportunity and ability to turn one\u0027s life around is a fundamental principle of justice and of the American Dream. Unfortunately, it seems this principle of American values has gone missing from our broken justice system. Fixing the way inmates interact with the outside world is an important step in restoring it.U.S. Senator for New JerseyCommissioner, Federal Communications CommissionPresident Obama has taken extraordinary measures to lower U.S. CO2 emissions, especially considering the congressional hand he was dealt. But it\u0027s nowhere near enough, and I can\u0027t help wonder what more he might have done if he\u0027d experienced a life-changing moment.Campaign consultantFirst came Fallujah, then Mosul, and later Ramadi in Iraq. Now, there is Kunduz, a provincial capital in northern Afghanistan. Together, these setbacks have rendered a verdict on the now more-or-less nameless Global War on Terrorism.Author, \u0027The Limits of Power: The End of American Exceptionalism\u0027The U.S., NATO, and the Afghan government all say they are conducting their own investigations into the attack, but only an independent investigation can uncover the facts we need to demand accountability and new safeguards to ensure this type of tragedy doesn\u0027t happen again.Co-founder, CODEPINK: Women for PeaceThe shortcomings of the measure for Social Security are obvious. Moreover, the same inadequate index is used for other programs for seniors and people with disabilities, including military retirement benefits, veterans\u0027 compensation, civil service retirement benefits and the means-tested Supplemental Security Income program.Founding Co-director, Social Security WorksThe numbers for this crisis are daunting. One of America\u0027s favorite past times is essentially draining the lifeblood and the future wealth out of the next generation and few realize it.Filmmaker, Brave New FoundationAt a Bernie Sanders rally in Boston on Saturday, October 3, members of our group, Boston Students for Justice in Palestine, were threatened with arrest after the campaign staff had requested the removal of a banner that read \"Will Ya? ?#FeelTheBern 4 Palestine??!\"Junior at Boston UniversityCommunity OrganizerIn this presidential election season, one thing is certain: candidates will rarely - if ever - be asked what they would do to keep this nation at the forefront of science and innovation. That\u0027s a shame.Independent source of news and analysis, from the academic and research community.Moscow calculated, correctly it appears, that the U.S. and its allies were not going to commit real forces to achieve their stated objectives in Syria. Forced to respond to Russian initiatives in the Middle East, Ukraine and elsewhere, the West is left searching for half-hearted compromises on Russian terms.Senior Fellow \u0026 Acting Director, CSIS Russia and Eurasia ProgramThis went down badly (not just \"tragically,\" as one of the experts put it) and the officers should be held accountable. An independent investigation would have asked the question: If the 911 caller could see that the \"suspect\" was a child, and the gun \"probably a fake,\" why couldn\u0027t trained police officers see that?Executive Director, Center for Constitutional RightsI hate to admit it, but I truly believe that dating apps have ruined dating forever. Thinking back to my college days, I only wish that it were still the norm to meet people in person. Now, people are looking to date those with the hottest photos, the best jobs -- basically anyone who looks good on paper.Avid blogger, writer and fitness buff. I enjoy writing about women in tech, life in Israel and new and innovating startups. Follow me at @Rachelwolf00 or on FacebookA lot of people are using the various examples of Ben Carson\u0027s recent comments to call him ignorant, thoughtless, insensitive and a narcissistic windbag who\u0027s unfit for the Presidency, but I submit that, perhaps, not only does he know better than us, but that he is better than us.Comedian/Breathing EnthusiastIf our country wants to give all children a shot at success and disrupt the intergenerational transmission of poverty, we need to provide more support to families with young children.Professor of social work and public affairs, Columbia University; Author, \u0027Too Many Children Left Behind\u0027The Volkswagen scandal hit new lows this week when German-born Michael Horn, CEO of Volkswagen America, refused to acknowledge the people responsible for falsifying emissions tests on 11 million vehicles or to release essential documents.Senior Fellow, Harvard Business SchoolYou are not a monster. You are a valuable, unique, wonderful human being who deserves everything grand that this life has to offer. Come out of the shadows and stand proudly in who you are.Composer/Lyricist, Singer/Pianist, Teacher, Graduate Student, Mental Health AdvocateTry to think of a policy idea that has the following characteristics: it costs almost nothing to implement; it has the potential to help millions of highly disadvantaged people raise their living standards; it is supported by both President Obama and the Koch brothers. You\u0027re envisioning the null set, right?Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributor34Justice co-founder and bloggerWe have two choices of when our children can fail: now or later. Now, they are still in a safe environment with people willing to help them succeed. Later, it will be in the context of the workplace or with their own families when the stakes are much higher.Educator, speech and debate coach, writerI remember the first time I knew something was wrong. I was in my junior year of high school when I thought about what would happen if I purposely fell down the stairs. I\u0027d always been an overachiever, but being the year before college that really mattered, I wanted to escape from the pressure that I was going through in school.Editorial WriterGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
