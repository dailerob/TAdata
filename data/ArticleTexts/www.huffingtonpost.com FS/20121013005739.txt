{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor of Literature at YaleMany people go into politics because a fantasy holds them captive. And the fantasies come in many kinds. There are those a leader may hold about himself, or about the role he has to play, or about the problems he is expected to solve. In Obama\u0027s case, the largest fantasy was perhaps this: that you can fight for a cause and win without fighting against anything. By nature and disposition, Obama is a man who blends and consolidates. The plaintive undertone that you hear sometimes, under his heartiest shout, really says to his listeners \"How can anyone reject what I\u0027m saying? This is so reasonable. And we know it already -- it\u0027s enough to remember what we know. Now, come along with me and agree that this is what we\u0027ve always stood for.\" But not everyone will call it reasonable unless the arguments and history are laid out in a connected order. In last night\u0027s debate, Joe Biden brought a reminder of what it sounds like when a politician offers reasons.Read Post | Comments (98)Howard Fineman, 10/12/12Editorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupSummoning a lifetime of passion, skill, knowledge, blarney and blindingly perfect teeth, Vice President Joe Biden last night managed to right the listing U.S.S.

James Martin, S.J., 10/12/12Catholic priest and author, \u0027The Jesuit Guide to (Almost) Everything\u0027When a Catholic candidate speaks about his or her faith, it\u0027s more important for voters to concentrate on their policies, rather than trying to worm their way into the person\u0027s soul.Read Post | Comments (26)Marian Wright Edelman, 10/12/12President, Children\u0027s Defense FundRuby Bridges is an inspiring reminder that our nation owes a huge debt of gratitude not just to the adults who took a stand during the Civil Rights Movement, but to the extraordinary children and youths who were front-line soldiers in the war to overthrow Jim Crow in American life.Read Post | CommentsJohn Hudak, 10/11/12Fellow in Governance Studies, Brookings InstitutionTonight Obama needed a champion, an advocate, and a force that did what he failed to do: show a contrast with Gov. Romney and rekindle the post-DNC enthusiasm. Joe was that force.Read Post | Comments (342)Craig Unger, 10/12/12Author, \u0027Boss Rove: Inside Karl Rove\u0027s Secret Kingdom of Power\u0027; Contributing Editor, Vanity FairKarl Rove\u0027s web of influence and his relationships with wealthy benefactors have enabled him to play a commanding under-the-radar role as king of the super PACs and de facto party boss of the Republican Party.Read Post | Comments (40)Amanda Mercer, 10/12/12Attorney and mother\"I discussed your desire to swim the Channel with the doctors on the tumor review board, and I\u0027m sorry, but no one believes that you will be able to do it.

El-Erian, 10/12/12CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOCentral banks should be respected. And they can certainly counter air pockets, but not forever. Either fundamentals will improve or asset prices will fall. Which outcome we eventually see depends in large part on whether other government entities finally step up to their policy responsibilities.Read Post | Comments (25)Richard Reeves, 10/12/12Former Deputy Director of Strategy to the UK GovernmentThe debates over social mobility will rage between and within the main political parties. But they should do so on firmer ground. The nuts and bolts of congressional and government machinery make poor copy for soaring campaign speeches. But the American Dream sorely needs some planning.Read Post | CommentsGreta Van Susteren, 10/12/12Host of Fox News\u0027 \u0027On the Record with Greta Van Susteren\u0027I think I am going to have a hard time convincing people who watched the debate last night, and who don\u0027t know the vice president personally, that Vice President Biden is a nice guy.Read Post | Comments (127)Arianna Huffington, 10/11/12The war has barely come up during a campaign that already seems interminable.

Amanda Todd\u0027s story brought back painful memories of my own experience with bullying, years of misery that nag at me even today. I didn\u0027t have any elementary school friends, so I got manipulated easily. Kids would pretend to be my friends, gain my trust, then relay embarrassing facts about my personal life to the rest of the school. My mistake was responding.Read Post | CommentsDavid Westin, 10/12/12Author, \u0027Exit Interview\u0027; Former President, ABC NewsIs it any wonder that Americans reportedly trust the news media less than they ever have before?

Alexander, 10/12/12Professor of Sociology and co-director of the Center for Cultural Sociology at Yale UniversityJoe sat in the back of the room and laughed. He was a holy fool and a brilliant bully. If he didn\u0027t deliver a knock-out, he certainly blocked the pilgrim\u0027s progress. He set the stage for the return of the hero next week.Read Post | Comments (108)Dan Kennedy, 10/12/12Assistant Professor, School of Journalism at Northeastern UniversityIt\u0027s theoretically possible to close the $5 trillion gap, or at least some of it, by closing loopholes and eliminating deductions.
