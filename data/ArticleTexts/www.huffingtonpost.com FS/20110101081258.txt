{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Happy New Year, HuffPosters! As we\u0027re sweeping up the confetti, let\u0027s raise a final glass to 2010. Amidst the disasters, the acrimony and the \"recovery, what recovery?\" economy, there was still much to celebrate. It was another exciting year at HuffPost as we continued to grow and evolve. There were new sections (hello Travel, Religion, Health, Education, Divorce, Food, College, Arts), and new ways to experience HuffPost on the go (hello, iPad app). And there\u0027s more to come next year: more sections, more original video and more HuffPost reporters covering everything from politics to business to popular culture -- with an emphasis on storytelling and putting flesh and blood on the data. Personally, I watched my youngest daughter join her sister in college and crisscrossed the country on a book tour (with many detours to visit the daughters in college!). On the road, I marveled at the resilience and ingenuity I encountered as people throughout America take it upon themselves to reconnect to those in need and rebuild their communities. Here\u0027s to a wonderful 2011, full of love, compassion, creativity and surprises!Read Post | CommentsHuffington Post, 12.30.2010Find out what HuffPost bloggers loved and hated in 2010, the first year of a young decade or the last of an old one.Read Post | CommentsKate Kelly, 12.31.2010Author of books on history and medicineThe first New Year\u0027s Eve celebration in Times Square occurred in 1904, just after the New York Times had relocated to a new building in what had been known as Longacre Square.Read Post | CommentsDave Winer, 12.31.2010Online publishing pioneerWikiLeaks is America\u0027s Tienanmen.
