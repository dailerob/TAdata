{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jason LinkinsEditor, Eat the PressIt\u0027s very strange. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s lost on any of these Republicans that the whole plan here is to hold the debt ceiling hostage in exchange for a series of demands. And they are making no offer in return -- raising the debt ceiling is what\u0027s supposed to be the concession. But then they are simultaneously putting out a message that breaching the debt ceiling would not be a big deal. What force, then, is supposed to compel the Democrats to come to the table? This is not how hostage-taking works. There is supposed to be the threat of a consequence. It\u0027s supposed to be, \"Pay my ransom or the hostage dies.\" It\u0027s not, \"Pay my ransom or else everything will be perfectly fine, hey, don\u0027t even worry about it.\"Comments (896)Niall FergusonLaurence A. Tisch Professor of History at Harvard University; Senior Fellow of the Hoover Institution, Stanford UniversityI would like to see Paul Krugman admit that he got the biggest call of the last several years dead wrong, again and again and again. Not only should he admit his mistake, but he should also apologize to the millions of people who have suffered as a result of it.Comments (1,357)Spencer OvertonProfessor of Law at The George Washington University Law School; Senior Fellow at DemosI attended today\u0027s U.S. Supreme Court oral argument in the case challenging contribution limits. If the Justices rewrite campaign finance law by striking down the contribution limits, checks of up to $2.95 million each from wealthy contributors will corrupt democracy.Comments (12)Paul PolmanCEO, UnileverWhen people talk about new forms of capitalism, this is what I have in mind: companies that show, in all transparency, that they are contributing to society, now and for many generations to come. Not taking from it.Comments (31)Hannah BrencherWriter, Millennial Communications Expert, Founder of MoreLoveLetters.comLife is a steep, uphill battle but it\u0027s fierce and it\u0027s beautiful and you\u0027ll be sad to see it go if you live it right.Comments (55)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027If we get to October 17 and the Republicans are still holding the nation hostage, the president has only one option.CommentsDan GolemanAuthor, \u0027Focus: The Hidden Driver of Excellence\u0027In this new normal we are all suffering a form of attention deficit as the ever-enticing successive crops of apps and tech gadgets take our focus away from the task at hand or the person in front of us.Comments (27)Joshua A. DouglasAssistant Professor of Law, University of Kentucky College of LawCongress, in its considered judgment, imposed an aggregate limit on campaign contributions in an effort to root out corruption. The question of whether the Court should defer to this legislative judgment did not receive much play at the Supreme Court today.CommentsLincoln MitchellHarriman Institute, Columbia UniversityThe government shutdown is not driven by a Republican desire to overturn the Affordable Care Act. Nor is it about trying to reign in government spending. It is, at its core, the latest act in an effort by the far right of the Republican Party to delegitimize the presidency of Barack Obama.Comments (857)Lisa BelkinSenior Columnist, The Huffington PostTo those who believe that there is an inverse relationship between parenting and happiness, there is the parallel finding that these “parents find caring for their children to be much more exhausting than the work they do for pay.” So we are enriched by our kids, but all that enrichment can be tiring? Makes sense to me.CommentsEve TahminciogluCareerdiva.netBoth HP and Yahoo\u0027s CEOs seem to think more face time translates into more light bulbs above employees\u0027 heads. But is that really true?CommentsSusanne MentzerOpera SingerAs a mere observer I am not privy to the inner workings of the NYC Opera or the Minnesota Orchestra. However, the bizarre logic of our congress allowing the NFL to not carry its weight while arts groups are gasping for air is insulting.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorA friend asks, \"How\u0027d you like to be John Boehner right now?\" Clearly, I\u0027m daydreaming, but I\u0027d like it. Because I\u0027d stride to the podium, whack the gavel, and say...Comments (17)Shelley EmlingSenior Editor, HuffPost 50Whether on TV or not, language is a tricky thing. Words can put people on the defensive -- or make them feel on top of the world. And, although, as the saying goes, \"words can never hurt me,\" they can annoy the heck out of someone. For example, no one in 2013 should still be uttering \u0027bromance,\u0027 or \u0027oh, awkward\u0027 or \u0027binders full of women.\u0027Comments (232)Nile CappelloEditorial fellow, HuffPost TasteUnless you are educated on OCD, have seen a therapist, or have some sort of confirmation other than your own unfortunate desire to connect with me about this -- I\u0027m going to be honest and let you know I really, really don\u0027t want to hear your superficial self-diagnosis.Comments (577)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027We are sacrificing close to $1 trillion in economic output every year precisely because there is not enough demand in the economy. The losses since the start of the recession are now approaching $5 trillion. This is equal to almost $40,000 for every household in the country.Comments (398)Kathleen ReardonProfessor, USC Marshall School; Author, \u0027The Secret Handshake\u0027 and \u0027Shadow Campus\u0027At what point do we call this more than taking a stand? When do we say it is a take-over by one part of the Republican Party perpetrated upon the rest? And if they\u0027ll do that to their own people, we know what\u0027s next for anyone who gets in their way.CommentsRichard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureTheir budget stance offends many Americans\u0027 sense of morality, since they\u0027re asking poor and middle-class Americans to subsidize the luxuries of the wealthy and the profits of powerful corporations. But in the end the country may reject their ideology for an even simpler reason: We can\u0027t afford it anymore.CommentsCarol HartsellSenior Comedy Editor, The Huffington PostEver since I was old enough to have self-deprecating thoughts, I\u0027ve been aware of one fundamental truth: British people are better than me. They\u0027ve got cooler accents, more interesting hair, come naturally dressed in layers, and they\u0027re both funnier and more miserable than anyone has a right to be.CommentsPratap ChatterjeeAuthor, Halliburton\u0027s Army: How A Well-Connected Texas Oil Company Revolutionized the Way America Makes WarWe willingly hand over all of this information to the big data companies and in return they facilitate our communications and provide us with diversions. But there is a second kind of data company of which most people are unaware.CommentsSteve DaltonCareer coach at Duke University\u0027s Fuqua School of Business and Author of “The 2-Hour Job Search”As a career coach, my job is to help job seekers succeed regardless of economic circumstances, but understanding my consumers and withholding judgment is a key first step. I\u0027ll call Gen Y unlucky. I\u0027ll call them victims of a bad economy. I refuse to call Gen Y entitled.CommentsSean McElweeWriterIf the clean CR passes, spending in 2014 will be $217 billion below what President Obama requested and $19 billion more than what Paul Ryan requested. That sounds like a victory to me.Comments (63)Seth ShostakSenior Astronomer, SETI InstituteWithout doubt, discovering proof that Triceratops, Nazis and miscellaneous hardware were once present on the rocky landscapes of Mars is great fun. But if you think that\u0027s what you\u0027re really seeing, you\u0027ve been victimized by that soft, squishy organ between your ears.CommentsJenny WitteFounder and blogger, Mamatoga.comIt won\u0027t be easy, especially with slutty fur trimmed cat costumes marketed towards kindergartners. It comes down to us, as parents, to help navigate this path.Comments (133)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistWhether they\u0027re childhood friends, neighborhood friends, family friends, girlfriends, boyfriends (or even boyfriends who eventually became boy friends, if you know what I mean), life wouldn\u0027t be half as much fun -- or as meaningful -- without the company of those who know what makes us tick (and vice versa).CommentsEric BoehlertSenior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaOne of the universal truths about the current government shutdown is that more Republican members of the House have adopted increasingly brazen political strategies because they\u0027re elected from safe districts. That storyline is deeply flawed, however.Comments (23)Khnum \u0027Stic\u0027 IbomuMember of the rap group Dead Prez; artist-activistWhen we only eat for taste we become slaves to taste alone. And as we learn from seeing far to many of our relatives sick and miserable and overweight and diseased, eating for taste without regard to health leads to self destruction. We can eat healthy on a hood budget.CommentsEmily KontosSocial epidemiologist, Harvard School of Public HealthDuring the government shutdown, the National Institutes of Health is turning away patients for clinical trials. This includes about 30 children each week, most of them cancer patients. Take a moment to look up your representatives\u0027 stances on funding for scientific research.CommentsCarole KingSinger, songwriter and environmental activistI don\u0027t understand how men and women who want the best for their children and grandchildren can be so blind to the consequences of their actions. There is nowhere to hide from global warming.Comments (227)Alissa ParkerBlogger, TheParkerFive and co-founder, safeandsoundschools.orgI miss Em a lot lately. I miss everything about her sweet, beautiful face smiling up at me. There are days when my face, I am sure, looks a lot like Emilie\u0027s did the day we let her butterflies go.Comments (71)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesThe fact that any American in 2013 -- let alone a justice of the United States Supreme Court, located in a major urban center with a large LGBT population -- can say he or she doesn\u0027t know anyone who is openly gay is pretty astounding. Scalia has spun a cocoon around himself.Comments (258)Steve Dalton, 2013. 8.10Marshall Fine, 2013. 8.10Sean Santiago, 2013. 8.10Shira Lazar, 2013. 8.10Adam Braun, 2013. 8.10Mitch Kellaway, 2013. 8.10Susan D.
