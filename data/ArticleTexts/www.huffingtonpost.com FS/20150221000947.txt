{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Communications consultantOn February 26, the FCC will do something that few have ever accused the government of doing. It will recognize reality and act appropriately. That, in a nutshell, is the debate over net neutrality. Just as plain telephone service connected people and was regulated, now it\u0027s data services. Calls or video are all just megabits. Telephone companies couldn\u0027t discriminate in their traffic then, neither should they or cable companies be able to play favorites or manipulate customers now. That basic, regulated fairness is what allowed the Internet to develop, a point some current opponents seem to miss, whether blinded by ideology or money. But if you listen to the anguished cri de coeur from the loyal defenders of the big telecom companies, you would think the FCC\u0027s action was a government coup d\u0027interconnecter -- a takeover of The Internet.My president doesn\u0027t love me. How sad! But forget me, I\u0027m just another citizen. The real tragedy here, I just learned, is that the president doesn\u0027t love Rudy Giuliani, a man who was an honest-to-God elected official.Founder, People for the American WayIt is not Greece that is broken, it is the world\u0027s financial system and banks that need repair. And that cannot happen given their lobbying control over our governments.Bestselling author of Survival Investing: How to Prosper Amid Thieving Banks and Corrupt Governments and professor of finance at S P Jain School of Global ManagementFor anyone who served on the ground in Iraq there is something horrifying about the idea of the ideologically blind, strategically ignorant \"thinkers\" -- Paul Wolfowitz chief among them -- who sent us into a misguided war without a plan to win the peace coming back into office. And yet, Jeb wants to get the gang back together.U.S. Representative, Arizona\u0027s 7th Congressional District; Iraq War veteranEddie Routh is reminiscent of the 20-year-old Army private, David Lawrence, deployed to Afghanistan, who on October 17, 2010, shot and killed a captured Taliban soldier he had arranged to guard. Controversy ensued: was he a criminal or mentally ill? Was he feigning madness to elude punishment?Medical director, New York State Office of Mental HealthIf people are afraid -- and it is fear that underlies the refusal to vaccinate -- they don\u0027t need to be badgered or sneered at, they need to be reassured. And that reassurance comes best from someone they trust. If not Roald Dahl, perhaps an older person who might remember what it was like before vaccines.Executive Director, National Center for Science EducationWe don\u0027t talk much about the scale of human suffering in Southeast Asia that came from U.S. intervention. American involvement in the Middle East could usefully be informed by the Asian experience, however: namely, that war has long-lasting consequences for the local populations, to say nothing of broader impacts.Executive Director, MIT Center for International StudiesCome with me. Let\u0027s open the door to a parallel universe. Here in this parallel world, the rules are different because gender roles are flipped. Loving parents and teachers accept this strange culture as if it\u0027s not so bad, or perhaps even good.Educational psychologist, consultant, and author of Her Next ChapterTwo Americans are dead and one is on trial for murder. I see so much pain and suffering. One of our most decorated soldiers was shot dead by another American soldier. Worse, it happened as he was trying to help another in his time of need.Editor, TypeZen.com: \u0027Going with the Flow in a Type A World\u0027Friends of liberty worldwide should offer aid and support to Burmese activists seeking to transform what remains an authoritarian system. Such assistance best comes outside of the U.S. government, lest democracy promotion be seen as yet another tool of American foreign policy.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteWe know that military means alone will not achieve our goals of peace and security in the Middle East. In addition to passing the AUMF, the Congress should take the far-sighted step of passing the Women, Peace and Security Act at the same time.CEO, The Carter CenterThe history in Internet innovation is the story of outsiders building a better mouse trap -- kids, dropouts, and non-Americans, given a neutral platform to prove their ideas. It was neutral because it was built that way.Author, \u0027Republic, Lost\u0027; Founder, RootstrikersWe as Americans and others in the West have long overlooked the ways our actions affect the world around us -- both in positive and negative ways. Lent must be a time to reflect and repent -- in our own lives, in our churches, and in our nation. It\u0027s time to turn around.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersWhen it comes to operatic staying power, look no further than star mezzo soprano Dolora Zajick. Critics have dubbed her \"a powerhouse\" because her voice is big, rich, and luscious throughout all the vocal registers and she\u0027s also a singer who can act.Arts writer and novelistWill our self-programming computers send out hostile orders to the chips we\u0027ve added to our everyday objects? Or is this just another disruptive moment, similar to the harnessing of steam or the splitting of the atom?CEO, Family Online Safety InstituteWhatever the reasons, many LGBT national leaders are nowhere on this terrible and potentially enormously impactful law.Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesWe cannot allow the deaths of Yusor, Razan, and Deah, and others, to be in vain. I hope that these tragedies, even years down the road, will unite all Americans, and remind us to respect the value of all lives, regardless of appearance, orientation, or belief.U.S. Representative, California\u0027s 15th Congressional DistrictWhat do you say we start with meat and fire, and see where we go from there?Everything worth caring about in food, drink, and travelThere are days when I wish there was a return/exchange lane for my children. Sort of like Costco\u0027s no-questions-asked return policy.A mom with a dirty kitchen and a dirty mind. www.mrsmuffintop.comOne of the most important goals of gender violence prevention work is to teach boys and young men that violence is not manly, and abuse is not sexy. To the extent that this movie complicates our efforts, it harms not just women. It also does damage to young heterosexual men.Educator, author, filmmaker, and cultural theoristThings will only start to change once we stop blaming women, and start challenging the flawed system they must navigate. And I have no problem saying that assertively.practical dreamer. hopeful realist. ravishly.com co-editor.I\u0027ve been accused of being responsible for the loss of innocent lives and labeled a Nazi who is having Muslims for breakfast.Foreign Editor, Jyllands-Posten and author of “The Tyranny of Silence\"Darting among hawkers, vendors, hoarders and careening motorcyclists, part of the over 16 million inhabitants of Nigeria\u0027s largest city, Lagos, Morin O. (Maureen Obaweya) squeezes her car into the Lekki market.This is for all of you out there that actually want to do something about this awkward time, here is how to unapologetically drop kick your quarter-life crisis into last week.Founder and Head Coach of Blush, an online life coaching company for girls (www.joinblush.com)The president says he\u0027ll veto the Keystone XL pipeline. He should do more, and put an end to the project altogether. He has the authority.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The Israeli general election, scheduled for March 17, can be fateful for the Israeli Arabs. If they want equal distribution of resources to improve their socioeconomic conditions, fully integrate into Israeli society, and contribute constructively to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, they must now fully exercise their right to vote and not squander this historic opportunity.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUFor the entire first year of your life, Cody, I kept wondering when the wonderment of being your mother would wear off. And after 12 months of diapers and white noise, nursing and nighttime battles, babbles and snuggles and something new learned every day, I\u0027ve come to the conclusion that it never will.Writer, therapist, new momAs long as Republicans keep opposing policies that most Latinos and Americans as a whole support, it\u0027s unlikely the Libre Initiative will have much success. But given the deep support and huge bank accounts of its two most important funders, the threat posed by Libre is one that we should all take seriously.President, People For the American WayTo doubt evolution at this late date is to reveal oneself to be willfully, invincibly ignorant of basic scientific principles. And there is no room in the Oval Office -- none -- for the scientifically illiterate.Professor of Law, University of St. ThomasIt isn\u0027t easy, since nothing worth doing ever is, but these first days and weeks and months will unfold and so will your love.Wife of one, mom of six boys, author, editor, musician, blogger at Crash Test Parents and Racheltoalson.comThe labor and civil rights movements worked hard to eliminate systems that perpetuate discrimination and segregation, and it is with this tradition in mind that the labor movement calls on the Supreme Court to uphold the disparate-impact protections of the Fair Housing Act to ensure fair treatment for every working American.President, AFL-CIOGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"FEDS STRIKE BACK ON IMMIGRATION",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
