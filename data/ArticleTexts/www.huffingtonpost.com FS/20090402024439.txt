But after reading Sloan Barnett\u0027s book about greening our homes, I decided to take a closer look at mine. Because, these days, \"green\" means a lot more than making your house energy efficient.

They went everywhere and looked at everything -- from the light bulbs in my bedroom to the logs burning in my fireplace -- reminding me every step of the way that going green is a process, and that you don\u0027t have to be the second coming of Ed Begley, Jr. to make a difference.Read Post | CommentsBIOBob Cesca, 04.01.2009Political Author, Blogger, and New Media ProducerCongratulations, Republicans, you just released a budget that rewards wealthy corporate executives while blocking any attempt to dig us out of the economic catastrophe they created.
