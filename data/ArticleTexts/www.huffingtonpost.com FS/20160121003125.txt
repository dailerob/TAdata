{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027Why did the white working class abandon the Democrats? The conventional answer is Republicans skillfully played the race card. In the wake of the Civil Rights Act, segregationists led southern whites out of the Democratic Party. Later, Republicans charged Democrats with coddling black \"welfare queens,\" being soft on black crime, and trying to give jobs to less-qualified blacks over more-qualified whites. The bigotry now spewing forth from Donald Trump and several of his Republican rivals is an extension of this old race card, now applied to Mexicans and Muslims -- with much the same effect on the white working class voters, who don\u0027t trust Democrats to be as \"tough.\" All true, but this isn\u0027t the whole story. Democrats also abandoned the white working class.On January 20, 2017, America will begin our next chapter.

Writer.PhotographerSince this new budding relationship with Iran has not been institutionalized, what will be left of it when the Obama administration leaves office? The challenge is to ensure that these channels of communication are not limited to the personal rapport that has developed between Kerry and Zarif, but will survive into succeeding administrations.President, National Iranian American CouncilLegal Fellow, National Iranian American CouncilThis is an enormously consequential shift in food and agriculture, and it is a clear signal to everyone concerned that gestation crates and battery cages are soon to be agricultural artifacts like the reaper and the threshing machine.President and CEO, The Humane Society of the United StatesWe\u0027re Facebook friends, but total strangers; three idealistic pilgrims on a quest to the faraway land of Iowa, that frigid empty wasteland that will decide our nation\u0027s next president.Writer and musician from ChicagoHere are two unfortunate things we know: 1. Jails and prisons are where too many people with mental illness are receiving, or rather not receiving, treatment. 2. A jail cell is unlikely to be a place of healing.

Here are 10 steps for what to do in case of a raid.Policy Director for Mijente and the #Not1More CampaignWe assume that low achievement indicates a poor school when, in fact, it is merely proof of a neglected community.

This is our first order of business: to raise the wage to $15 an hour and secure the floor so that it is not devalued by inflation.President of the Patriotic Millionaires, public policy expert, commentator, and authorOutside of the strange and insular world of extreme right-wing politics, most folks generally recognize the hazards of climate change: deadly heat waves, droughts, more frequent and more severe cyclones, floods, wildfires, catastrophic loss of marine life, and shifts in agricultural productivity.Scientist and former White House Senior Policy Analyst; Ph.D. in marine biology/neurophysiologyI began to get \"the gun thing,\" as I\u0027d dismissively termed it.

These pledges broke through decades of gridlock, but if fulfilled, get us only halfway to climate rescue.Former executive director and chairman, Sierra ClubIt\u0027s sad that Donald Trump is normalizing so many unsavory traits with his presidential push this season.

However, this new expected surge of crude oil exports will be entering a market that is clouded by too little transparency. Better data is needed urgently in order to evaluate and quantify the oil sector\u0027s climate responsibilities.Director, Carnegie’s Energy and Climate Program; ex-Chevron chemical engineerWhile it\u0027s more than fair to tear into Ted Cruz and Donald Trump for denying basic science, it\u0027s impossible to win the fight for the climate by simply lambasting the right.Truman National Security Fellow, Public Policy Consultant, Meditation TeacherOnce the decision had been made to support her, trying to figure out if she was transgender or gender non-conforming didn\u0027t weigh as heavily.
