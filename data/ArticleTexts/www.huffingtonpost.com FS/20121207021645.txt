{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Christian leader for social changeThe discussion we are having about \"the fiscal cliff\" is really a debate about our fiscal soul. What kind of nation do we want to be? We do need a path to fiscal sustainability, but will it include all of us -- especially the most vulnerable? It\u0027s a foundational moral choice for the country, and one with dramatic domestic and deadly global implications. Fiscal responsibility means ensuring that the money we spend is truly accomplishing what it should and that means constant reform and improvement of both the private and public sectors. And true fiscal responsibility means making the necessary investments today to ensure a future for generations to come. But the line in the sand should always be that the poorest and most vulnerable are truly protected.Read Post | Comments (143)Bob Cesca, 12/06/12Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez Show, Media ProducerThe bumper-sticker party of \"these colors don\u0027t run\" -- the party that practically branded the notion of American patriotism -- is only around half-sure that it doesn\u0027t want to abandon the United States. The other half is split between still making up its mind on secession and totally wanting to secede right away.Read Post | Comments (582)William Kennedy, MD, 12.05.2012William A.

It is possible, but really highly unlikely. The regime is using the chemical option as a possible, desperate leverage aimed at the U.S., Turkey, and much less against Israel.Read Post | Comments (93)Jerome Karabel, 12/06/12Professor of Sociology, University of California at BerkeleyForty four percent of all Democratic votes come from minorities, compared to just 11 percent of Republican votes. With the minority vote destined to play an ever-growing role in American politics, the \"Southern strategy\"­ -- the foundation of Republican dominance for the quarter century between 1968 and 1992 -- ­is dead.Read Post | CommentsMary Haft, 12/05/12Writer and Producer, Haft Productions; Author, \u0027Nantucket: Portrait of an American Town\u0027Even now, 20 years after the birth of my last child, I am strangely exhilarated by the validation of a medical condition that I suffered with through the pregnancies of all my children. I suspect more people than I knew thought I was exaggerating, that morning sickness is routine and I was complaining about an all-too-common condition.Read Post | Comments (80)Ralph Jones, 12/05/12A writer of comedy and articles on religionThe university\u0027s feminist society labelled the decision \"hugely discriminatory, deeply offensive and sexist to women\"; no argument from me there, but just apply this quote to religion in general, whose history is mired in inescapably revolting attitudes towards women, and you need not change the phraseology.Read Post | Comments (273)Neil Young, 12/06/12Activist and rock legendFor survival of the planet and our way of life as human beings, we need to drastically reduce our carbon output. The approach being taken does not do that.Read Post | CommentsArt Brodsky, 12/06/12Internet activist and bloggerSometimes with wars, it\u0027s hard to tell when it\u0027s won or lost. See Iraq and Afghanistan. The War on Christmas, as with any other war, needs a set of metrics to guide policymakers on the severity of the conflict, and to let those on the sidelines know when it\u0027s all over, or just slightly over, or if the cause is lost.Read Post | CommentsDebra K. Decker, 12/06/12President, Decker Advisors, LLCWe keep getting twisted and tied up by urgent matters because we don\u0027t address America\u0027s important underlying issues: what we want as a people and the role of government in helping us achieve that.

As long as homophobia exists, as long as gay people suffer from homophobic acts, the word will remain crucial to our humanity.Read Post | Comments (17)Michael S. Lofgren, 12/06/12Former Republican Congressional StafferI am sure we have all had it up to here with breathless reporting about the fiscal cliff. But within a month or two after the December 31, 2012 deadline for resolving the cliff, there looms another, more serious economic issue: extending the debt limit.Read Post | Comments (127)Ira Chernus, 12/06/12Blogger at MythicAmerica.usAll the Obamas signed the card, even their little dog Bo. In fact, Bo is the star of the card. There he is right on the front -- take a look -- romping through the snow on the Obamas\u0027 lawn.

When you think about it, for example, what the photo offers is not the story of what happened so much as its consequence.Read Post | Comments (270)Rev. Al Sharpton, 12/05/12President, National Action NetworkWhen the top 2 percent were enjoying tax breaks and stockpiling prosperity, there was no sharing. Now they have the audacity to ask seniors, minorities, folks whose children fought in our wars, the disenfranchised and the most vulnerable among us to sacrifice some more. Does that seem fair?Read Post | Comments (913)Zinnia Jones, 12/06/12Orlando-based atheist activist, parent, and video bloggerIn the absence of any concrete statements from Manning, it\u0027s impossible to know for certain how he prefers to be known, but if his use of a female name was indeed one of the reasons why Manning was placed on a highly restrictive status, that\u0027s a very troubling justification.Read Post | Comments (33)Elena Panaritis, 12/06/12Founder, Panel Group; Author, \u0027Prosperity Unbound\u0027Austerity has made it difficult for Greece to meet its fiscal targets, as well as its structural reforms. This is why anything short of debt forgiveness and more bailout funds is only a way for Europe to buy a little bit of time but at a huge price.Read Post | Comments (11)Richard Babcock, 12/06/12Author, EditorWhich is better, Chicago or New York?
