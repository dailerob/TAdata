{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"We finally found out the real problem with the mainstream media: They\u0027re agnostic on sanity. That\u0027s the only conclusion that can be drawn from the refusal of mainstream-media organizations to allow their employees to attend Jon Stewart\u0027s Rally to Restore Sanity. That\u0027s right, in a showdown between nonpartisan sanity and partisan madness, the traditional media have boldly decided to... not take a stand. This media groupthink explains a lot -- including why we find ourselves in a time and place in our country in which a rally to restore sanity is even necessary. Taking a stand for sanity is neither right nor left. It\u0027s reasonable. That\u0027s why HuffPost is providing buses for people who need a ride to the rally. At the moment, more than 10,000 people have signed up to allow us to drive them sane. Yes, that will be a lot of buses -- but there\u0027s a lot of sanity to restore.Read Post | CommentsLinda Bergthold, 10.14.2010Health policy consultantSince the Clinton health reform effort failed in the early 1990s, Republicans have been using the same talking points that Christine O\u0027Donnell used Wednesday night.

Journalists, properly empowered, are curious. They want to know things. NPR is telling them not to ask questions.Read Post | CommentsTom Matzzie, 10.14.2010Media, Politics and TechnologyI do not share some dogmatic belief that Democrats are perfect. I\u0027ve been frustrated too.

Fritz Hollings, 10.14.2010Former South Carolina SenatorA Constitutional amendment to limit or control spending on political campaigns is absolutely necessary to return the people\u0027s government back to the people.
