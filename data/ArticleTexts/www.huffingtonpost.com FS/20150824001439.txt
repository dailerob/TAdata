{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week we saw how dissimilar appeals to our better and lesser angels look. For the former, there was Jimmy Carter\u0027s grace-filled press conference on Thursday revealing that cancer has spread to his brain. He reflected proudly on the work of his Carter Center, which, among many other things, has nearly eradicated the misery-causing guinea worm disease. But the week began very differently, as Donald Trump released an immigration plan that would end birthright citizenship, a proposal that would involve reverting to before the 14th amendment, ratified in 1868 to grant freed slaves citizenship in the wake of the shameful Dred Scott decision. Quite a vision for the future. Meanwhile, Jeb Bush said he disagreed with Trump, but made sure to get in on the xenophobia with the term \"anchor babies.\" It was a week that gave us two very different examples of statesmanship and what America can stand for.In considering this matter, it is instructive to examine both the unspoken assumptions in the situation and the questions that are rarely asked. Let us consider a few of these assumptions, beginning with the most serious: that Iran is the gravest threat to world peace.Institute Professor emeritus, MIT Department of Linguistics and PhilosophyThe benefits of parental leave extend beyond newborn health: When fathers take leave, they participate more in early child rearing, and that level of engagement continues after the leave ends. The evidence also shows that mothers who take leave are more likely to get raises in the year following their leave -- 54 percent more likely.Co-chair, the Bill and Melinda Gates FoundationThe 15th edition in our growing global network, HuffPost Australia will be dedicated to producing great original reporting about the critical issues that Australians face, and to telling stories that focus on helping Australians live more fulfilling lives, while opening up our blogging platform to voices from all across the country.After a dozen years as administrator of the Pulitzer Prizes and many years as a journalist and professor, I retired last August into a life of creative dabbling on the Upper West Side. Then, the renowned American Museum of Natural History began to misbehave.Retired administrator of the Pulitzer PrizesSelf-restraint is not a characteristic of the companies developing robotics for businesses that want to replace tens of millions of both white collar and blue collar jobs. Look at the latest factories, refineries and warehouses to illustrate what is coming fast. Even the work of lawyers is being automated.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorIt\u0027s a term I\u0027ve always loathed, and one that\u0027s dogged just about every working mother I know, for decades. The stunningly naïve belief that once we women had The Vote, The Pill, No-Fault Divorce and Equal Pay, that we could now go about the business of having The Job, The Marriage, The Kids, The Home we wanted, and -- some sanity.Editor-at-large, HuffPost Australia, and host of TodayIt\u0027s possible that billions of years ago, tiny bits of biology quit the Red Planet and infected ours. If so, your family tree -- and that of every other terrestrial life form -- has its deepest roots not in the ancient oceans of Earth, but in the vanished seas of Mars.Senior Astronomer, SETI InstituteStay-at-home mom is not a real job. At most places of employment, when you take lunch, you\u0027re actually allowed to feed yourself, not spend lunchtime preparing a meal for your boss, cutting it into painstakingly small pieces, while he screams at you for not moving faster.Wife, mom, avid sports fanThe prospective Israeli-Hamas truce presents a momentous opportunity, albeit in disguise, for all parties concerned to turn a new page in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and change its geopolitical and security dynamics, which succeeding Israeli and Palestinian governments could build on.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUI learned that being gay is an inborn trait no different than height and hair color. After all, if it weren\u0027t, don\u0027t you think centuries of fervent efforts to rid humanity of it would have shown at least some modicum of success? Yet here we are.Engaged Gen-X malcontent with a passion for Equality, Ford Mustangs, dinosaurs, grammatical correctness, science, and the Horror \u0026 Sci-Fi genres.In January 1983 I was one of 163 members sworn in to the Missouri House. How I was treated then had a lot to do with how I looked. It took a while, but I would overcome the \"ditzy blonde\" stereotype as the only female lawyer, though not the only woman, in the state house.U.S. Senator from MissouriIt seems that Pennsylvania is about to adopt a new (well, not entirely new) approach to criminal sentencing: Those convicted of crimes will receive longer or shorter sentences depending on whether they are deemed likely to commit crimes in the future.Davidson-Kahn Distinguished University Professor and Professor of Law at Florida International University; Floershimer Distinguished Visiting Professor of Law at Cardozo Law School1. Spend five dollars more on a cocktail to avoid a hangover.Publisher at Tidbits Media GroupWe are all too familiar with the sinking feeling of Sunday evening. After indulging in a life-giving weekend full of things we love, we are now hours away from reentering the corporate race. When did it all go so wrong?Portland dreamer, learner and introvert.Children of color need to be able to see themselves in the books they read. Just as importantly, all children need to be exposed to a wide range of books that reflect the true diversity of our nation and world as they really are.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundA good film could have been a great film if the men involved, including Ice Cube and Dre as executive producers, would have had the vision and courage to not only tell their story, but to tell it with bold and fearless transparency, even where it would have been an indictment of themselvesPublic speaker and activist; author, \u0027Barack Obama, Ronald Reagan, and the Ghost of Dr. King: Blogs and Essays\u0027When the Puerto Rico debt crisis burst into the news, Puerto Rico Governor Alejandro García Padilla pronounced that the Commonwealth\u0027s debt crisis \"is not about politics.\" Of course, to paraphrase H.L. Menken, when a politician says something is not about politics, chances are it\u0027s all about politics.President, Fiscal Strategies Group\"I am not going to second guess [President Barack Obama] because I was in a position to set this in motion,\" Clinton said. \"I want to wait and see what he and Secretary Kerry decide.\" She then followed up with what might be one of the worst rejoinders ever delivered from the campaign trail.Co-founder and Communications Director, 350.orgI saw drones and battle tanks; I could very well have been in a war zone. I guess, in a sense, I was. I was in a space where large groups of Black lives were gathered in a system that is designed to respond to Black lives with violence. I know that I speak for Ms. McSpadden and Mr. Brown Sr. when I tell you to never stop fighting, and that we are grateful.Founder of Garner Way Foundation and daughter of Eric GarnerPolitical Director for Garner Way FoundationJulian Assange has effectively insisted that another media world is possible and the corporate warfare state is unacceptable. Not coincidentally, the U.S. government wants to capture Assange and put him away, incommunicado, in a prison cell.Author, \u0027War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death\u0027In recent days, the commentariat has made much out of the fact that news about Hillary Clinton\u0027s use of a private email server has drowned out the policy proposals she has unveiled. These proposals indeed deserve public attention. However, they also reveal one of her campaign\u0027s great weaknesses: its tendency to treat the public as if it were a conglomerate of special interest groups.Professor of international relations, George Washington UniversityMy socioeconomic background (and the teen mom status and high school level of education that came with it) was always lingering in the back of my mind, making me feel very inadequate. But it also made me work even harder to keep up and grow as much as I possibly could.Hyper, busy mom and runnerAt a time when income inequality is running rampant in the U.S., workers don\u0027t need even more \"free\" trade agreements that will further strip this nation\u0027s economy of middle-income jobs.General President, International Brotherhood of TeamstersCorporate welfare is often camouflaged in taxes that seem neutral on their face but give windfalls to big entrenched corporations at the expense of average people and small businesses. Take a look at commercial property taxes in California, for example.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027We have already done a great experiment to see how things work out for people without Social Security. That experiment was called life during the 1920s and 1930s.U.S. Representative for New York\u0027s 12th District; Ranking Democrat, Joint Economic CommitteeThe Black Lives Matter protest was disruptive, loud, tense and passionate. The first thing that came to my mind was ACT UP, a group I was a part of, which engaged in similar kinds of protest and disruption, including against Democratic presidential candidates. The urgency of the protest was similar as well: People are dying, and no one in power seems to be doing anything to stop it.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostThere is no \"off\" switch. We just keep moving forward, like the Energizer Bunny on crack.Blogger at That\u0027s InappropriateAs Joe Biden polls family and friends about entering the presidential fray, he\u0027s getting two kinds of advice -- personal and political. The personal is about his life, his values and what he can give to his country. The political is about Hillary Clinton\u0027s vulnerability.USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorEarth is full of lots of different people with different concerns, but we all share the same planet. Now is the time to work together to protect it. Making progress on climate change is going to take all of us together, across the U.S. and around the world.Executive Director, NYC Environmental Justice AllianceGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
