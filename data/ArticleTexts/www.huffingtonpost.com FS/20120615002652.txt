{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"I\u0027m delighted to introduce you to our new iPad magazine. At HuffPost, we now have nearly 500 editors and reporters who produce between 70 and 80 original reported stories each day. Our team is constantly crafting an array of narrative jewels, and Huffington is our way of putting the very best of them in the perfect setting. Far from merely importing material from HuffPost, Huffington will bring the qualities that define HuffPost -- storytelling, engagement, community -- to this uniquely expressive medium, designed and produced by our iPad magazine\u0027s team of editors and designers. Think of Huffington as HuffPost\u0027s more stylish offspring. Same DNA, different presentation. And since engagement is a big part of everything we do, stories can be shared by Facebook, Twitter, and email, and they end with a comment bubble: tap it, share your comment, and continue the conversation.Read Post | Comments (95)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 06/14/12Author, \u0027Our Fathers, Ourselves.
