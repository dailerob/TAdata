It looks as if a revival of the interminable series of candidate debates that dogged the countryside like a Biblical plague in the early part of the campaign season is not going to happen. Everyone can get on with their lives, and, if necessary, just replay highlights of the previous four hundred debates, content in the knowledge that the moderators basically ran out of new questions to ask everybody back in October.

Al Sharpton, 2/16/12President, National Action NetworkEvery day we walk past or ignore another Jeremy Lin -- people who may not look like what society deems a \u0027winner.\u0027 But given the right circumstances, these folks would shine; there\u0027s a Lin in every school, church, job. You may be ignored, but never lose sight of your own strengths and abilities.Read Post | CommentsAmelia, 2/16/12Mother, wife, partner and breadwinnerI thought there was a fair chance that he would someday say, \"I\u0027m gay.\" But my kid is only 7 years old.
