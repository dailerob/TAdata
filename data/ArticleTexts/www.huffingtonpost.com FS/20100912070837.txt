{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week we learned that, when it comes to inflating a non-story into a leads-the-news story, the media has learned nothing since Falcon Heene\u0027s transformation into Balloon Boy. But, of course, Balloon Boy\u0027s saga didn\u0027t put American lives at risk, as did the elevation of the nutty ramblings of a certain Florida-based pastor whose name I\u0027ve promised to never mention again. Since when do we give a national platform to the delusional ranting of a screw-loose extremist with fewer than 50 followers? There\u0027s a guy in Belleview who thinks he\u0027s Napoleon, but no one was leading the political chat shows with his plans for 9/11.

Marc Ginsberg, 09.10.2010Former US Ambassador to MoroccoIt\u0027s 9/11 again... do you know where Osama Bin Laden is? Nine years later Al Qaeda is still plotting attacks in the name of a global jihad. The mission against Al Qaeda is being drowned out, and that strengthens our enemies. Americans deserve better.Read Post | CommentsVan Jones, 09.07.2010Senior Fellow, Center for American Progress, American Progess Action FundSometimes it is hard to imagine that the cycle of destruction and suffering will ever end. But viable solutions exist, and the Gulf\u0027s beauty will return -- stronger than ever.Read Post | CommentsJane White, 09.06.2010President of Retirement Solutions, LLC.Many Americans are likely to have to work until they are dead, not as a result of Social Security shortfalls but because of their inadequate 401(k) savings or the fact that they have no retirement plan at all.Read Post | CommentsChris Kelly, 09.10.2010Writer, Real Time with Bill MaherBeck didn\u0027t even realize September 11th was the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.
