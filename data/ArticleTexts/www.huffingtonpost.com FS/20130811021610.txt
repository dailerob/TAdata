{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe third of five boys born in the Bronx to a single mother who dropped out of high school, Darryl Briggs was starting out with at least two strikes against him. Growing up poor, Black, and bright in the Bronx without guidance, by the time he got to high school he already felt completely ignored, almost invisible. Darryl’s high-poverty high school was eight floors overflowing with 8,000 students and an obvious lack of resources: “There were easily 35 students to a classroom and there weren’t even 35 desks in the classroom for the 35 students to sit in . . . there was one lab in the entire school.” The physical conditions discouraged learning, but for Darryl, the worst part was the lack of one-on-one attention. His classes were uninteresting and way too easy. None of the teachers noticed his potential and need for academic challenges, or even noticed him at all. When he skipped class, no one asked why. When he started hanging out with the “wrong crowd,” no one told him that wasn’t a good idea.Comments (310)Keith BarryMagicianThe power of hypnosis is a constant source of debate. My own research and the fact that I have now hypnotized over 3,000 people give me a unique and personal view of how the brain functions subconsciously.Comments (231)Leighton WoodhouseCo-founder, DogParkMedia.comPresident Obama\u0027s performance Friday was even less persuasive than his pretense of holding Wall Street accountable for the crimes that led to the economic meltdown.Comments (118)Anthony W. OrlandoLecturer in the College of Business and Economics at California State University, Los AngelesAt the heart of today\u0027s political gridlock is a sense of disconnect. Too many Americans feel disconnected from their government, their economy, and even their fellow citizens.Comments (156)Natacha HildebrandBlogger, Sass \u0026 CircumstanceTo those that are younger, 27 seems old, mature, ripe with adulthood things like clean apartments, fiancées and a general together-ness. To those older, I am still young, naive in many ways and have oh-so-much to learn. To me? 27 \u003d freaking the f*** out.Comments (72)Mark S. KingBlogger, MyFabulousDisease.com; author, \u0027A Place Like This\u0027When I was 9 I took my parents\u0027 album of the Broadway musical Damn Yankees and memorized every syllable of Gwen Verdon\u0027s show stopper, \"Who\u0027s Got the Pain When They Do the Mambo?\" Once I was satisfied with my lip synching and choreography, the number was ready for public display.Comments (15)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesThe ugly truth about Russia\u0027s law against gay \"propaganda,\" now the subject of worldwide protests and boycotts, is coming into view. And that includes the role of American companies sponsoring the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, as well that of the International Olympic Committee.Comments (412)Lewis RichmondBuddhist writer and teacherThe Dalai Lama advised that we should concentrate on living as \"sincere human beings\"--a Buddhist description of success that I find unaccountably touching.Comments (108)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarIn my work as a research psychologist currently studying women in the workplace, I hear women describe this sort of near-obsessive commitment to work with increasing frequency. For many, it\u0027s how they develop feelings of self worth. This can be both empowering and dangerous.Comments (11)Arianna HuffingtonI\u0027m solidly behind any effort to show that we\u0027re more than just our marginal contribution to our bank account, the bottom line of our employer or the gross national product of our country. But it\u0027s important to look at the whole picture.Comments (97)Anne TheriaultFeminist bloggerYou are a bad person who deserves bad things. You are unhappy because you are lazy or lacking in willpower. Your family and friends do not love you. Everyone deserves better than you. Everything is your fault. There is no cure for your sadness.Comments (495)Tom CramerLate Boom, Early XBruises, bumps and bandages were like badges of honor, and I couldn\u0027t wait to display mine on my trusty Schwinn Sting-Ray.Comments (33)Seth ShulmanSenior Staff Writer, Union of Concerned ScientistsWhile Koch-funded groups like AFP are unlikely to heed the message anytime soon, there is every indication in the solar energy field that the political terrain is starting to shift dramatically.Comments (869)Marten WeberAuthor, \u0027Shayno,\u0027 \u0027Benedetto\u0027 and \u0027In the Mirror a Monster\u0027\u0027One of the things I love most about our digital, global age is the ability to connect with people around the world so easily. If you don\u0027t use social apps as a sexual hookup tool but a genuine place to make new friends, you can meet the most interesting people!CommentsDan TreadwayAssociate blog editor, The Huffington PostWhat\u0027s $1.5 trillion? Well, even if you reduce the figure to take into account inflation, it\u0027s enough to cover any estimate of the outstanding student loan debt in America or patch up much of the nation\u0027s aging infrastructure.Comments (172)Chris WeigantPolitical writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comLove him or hate him, call him \"patriot\" or \"traitor\" -- it is now absolutely impossible to argue that Edward Snowden\u0027s leaks weren\u0027t effective, meaningful, and will actually cause the federal government to have a national conversation with its citizens about what it feels it is legally able to do.Comments (44)Ryan BuxtonEditorial fellow, HuffPost LiveI always assumed the years of hiding my truth from my dad didn\u0027t matter, that once I came out to him we\u0027d have all the time in the world to reconcile our opposing viewpoints. Instead, closure was another thing we didn\u0027t get to share.Comments (57)James ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027What we found in the July poll is that Egyptian attitudes toward both their internal political situation and their relationship with the United States are conflicted and in flux.CommentsArianna HuffingtonIn this week\u0027s issue, Zach Carter and Jason Cherkis look at the 30-year tenure of Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, Gregory Beyer and Catherine Pearson examine how the rising average retirement age is prompting more and more individuals and companies to prioritize well-being, and Carolyn Gregoire looks at the lasting effects of stress on one particular demographic: men.CommentsBenjamin Todd JealousPresident and CEO, NAACPRemember the March on Washington? August 28, 1963. Tens of thousands of activists on the National Mall. A preacher\u0027s son from Atlanta talking about his dream for the country. We don\u0027t need to watch a rerun of that fateful day. We need a sequel.Comments (257)Beth WoolseyWriter, humorist at the Five Kids Is A Lot of Kids blogWe all know the old adage \"never pee into the wind,\" but there are some additional, quality, \"how to\" ideas about peeing that are not, apparently, self-evident. For those times, here are 15 rules for peeing.Comments (131)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureWhy haven\u0027t any bankers gone to jail? What\u0027s going on in this country? Here are seven things about Wall Street crime and Washington \"justice\" you might have wanted to know, but were probably too depressed to ask.Comments (478)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistImagine a woman public official, spicing up her business trip with a rendezvous with her favorite male prostitute. Would a confession help? Would a vow of rehab do the trick? Not on your life. Scarlet A\u0027s would be tattooed on their foreheads.Comments (194)Katja BroseEditor, \u0027Neuron\u0027; Executive Editor for \u0027Neuroscience\u0027, Cell PressThe more interesting question is, if neuroscience can explain magic, can magic teach us anything about neuroscience?CommentsSharda SekaranManaging Director of Communications, Drug Policy AllianceDr. Sanjay Gupta is making waves for his recent reversal of opinion on medical marijuana. Part of this has to do with an expansive body of medical evidence but the touching story of a 5-year-old girl may have also played a meaningful role.Comments (87)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorWhen opponents talk about who\u0027s earning the minimum wage, they\u0027re often referring to the demographics of those at today\u0027s minimum. But that\u0027s not the relevant sample when you\u0027re evaluating a proposed increase in the wage floor.Comments (216)Daphne EviatarSenior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstPresident Obama, at his pre-vacation press conference Friday, promised more \"transparency\" on U.S. government surveillance programs. But he made no mention of the need for more information about who our government is secretly killing abroad.Comments (122)Jaleh BisharatVice President of Marketing, oDeskIt used to be that you attended university and then you went to work. Now, the demand for skills is changing fast. No matter how experienced you are, you need to be nimble.Comments (37)Stephen KesslerDirector, \u0027Paul Williams Still Alive\u0027There will be many articles devoted to the work Karen Black did, so this one will be dedicated to talking about what a wonderful person she was.Comments (24)Kevin McDonoughSyndicated columnist and television criticBefore GOP chairman Reince Priebus started criticizing NBC for announcing its Hillary miniseries project, maybe he should have asked himself, \"What would Ronald Reagan Do?\"Comments (49)Emily Atkinson2012 Millennial Values Fellow, The Berkley Center at Georgetown UniversityI was furious, and I couldn\u0027t quite articulate exactly what had set me off. The patently false notion that everything used to be great all the time? The persistence of American exceptionalism?
