{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Public CitizenEighty-four percent of Americans think money has too much influence in U.S. politics. Why is there such overwhelming consensus on this point? Because it reflects a common-sense understanding of how our elections run and why the government fails to adopt available solutions to our biggest problems -- even when those solutions have overwhelming support. Examples include raising the minimum wage; adopting stronger environmental standards; empowering Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices; breaking up the big banks; expanding Social Security benefits; ending corporate trade deals like NAFTA and the TransPacific Partnership; and on and on. But here\u0027s the thing: Big Money is poised to tighten its grip over elections and politics far more than it already has. \"Can things actually get worse?\" you ask. You bet.We are excited to launch Talk to Me, a new HuffPost series that is classic HuffPost: engagement, conversation, and connecting people across boundaries.Creator and executive producer of \"Talk To Me\" at The Huffington PostVery few people in the United States have any appetite for revolution, or anything like it.

She pays a very high price, as a candidate, for her lady genes.Feminist, writer, and satirist (not always in that order)Players who take shortcuts to success may advance for a while, but end up hurting themselves and their teams in the end. Campaigns who ignore the fundamentals of a campaign by failing to turn the self expression of activism into movement-building or organizing will fall short.Chair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusI grew paler and thought ah, I must be fair now. I would wink at myself in the mirror as I got ready in the mornings. Now I am suitable and desirable and marriage material. And I carried on like that till college.Writer, editor, and zine queenWhat is most offensive about the Trump, Cruz, Carson, anti-abortion contention that women who have abortions are \"victims\" is that it is profoundly dishonest and insulting to the dignity and integrity of women. They should be ashamed.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoAs curator of the Oscar de la Renta exhibition, now at de Young Museum of Fine Arts, in San Fransisco, it was a great privilege to illustrate in eight galleries, the comprehensive and profound depths of his career, from his early works in the Sixties, under the label Elizabeth Arden, to his own name, to the end of his life, when he died in October 2014.Contributing editor, VogueIf candidates (and presidents) are ultimately the ones who set the example for their supporters, Senator Sanders seems to have given the green light to his supporters to let loose on Senator Clinton -- and not on policy.Public Relations Consultant, www.winningprogressive.comWhen President Franklin Roosevelt brought the federal minimum wage into its infancy, California\u0027s had already graduated from college and was in the workforce. California\u0027s century-old enactment of a minimum wage was sound policy. We simply honor our past by investing in our future.South Los Angeles Native, Twin, Morehouse Alum, Democrat, Civil Righter, State Legislator, Chair- Committee on Revenue\u0026Taxation, Millennial.Perhaps younger people don\u0027t realize the damage that a conservative state legislature can do to all of the proposals Sanders so strongly supports.

Membership is free and will last for the next 18 years.Wife, mother, and professor. Usually exhausted.One of the truly dumbest arguments I hear in favor of free trade is that national borders are \"arbitrary.\" I usually get this from right-wing libertarian types, but occasionally from \"one world\" leftists, too. But it\u0027s not true.Author, \u0027Free Trade Doesn\u0027t Work,\u0027 Advisor, Coalition for a Prosperous AmericaAlarmingly, the nuclear competition between India and Pakistan has now entered a spine-chilling phase. That danger stems from Islamabad\u0027s decision to deploy low-yield tactical nuclear arms at its forward operating military bases along its entire frontier with India.Author, \u0027Apocalyptic Realm: Jihadists in South Asia\u0027As a scholar trained in literary studies and a translator of contemporary Russian poetry, I dedicate this post to a translation (below) of Zakharova\u0027s historic and startling achievement in politico-poetical communication.Author, Terror and Greatness: Ivan and Peter as Russian MythsCrouching under a wooden desk is about as much of a positive response to nuclear attack as giving someone a week-long course in armed force and then have them walking through a school hallway looking for a kid with a gun.Mike the Gun GuyNow, more than ever, women need to make sure state legislatures hear loud and clear that we refuse to be used as props to support transphobic and bigoted bills that hurt our trans sisters and deflect energy from real work to end gender violence.Student at Yale Law School, Fellow in the Yale Law Information Society\u0027s Project Reproductive Justice ProgramDonald Trump does not want to be president.

His entire campaign has been a long con and a ruse to strengthen his brand and feed his ego.Richard Zombeck is a freelance writer and a podcaster at TandZTalk.com.Fasten your seat-belts, make sure your seat-back is in the upright position and your table is stowed: I promise you a bumpy ride!WriterCorporations are telling Republicans they\u0027re not so sure they\u0027ll pony up for the 2016 GOP convention because they don\u0027t want to be associated with the Republican candidates\u0027 hate-mongering.International President, United SteelworkersTo all my trans brothers and sisters: don\u0027t feel that you need to rush because transition is a journey in discovering yourself.

We have some Tears Of Our Parents For Dating Interracially in the pitcher. My parents\u0027 version is slightly salty but ultimately okay, while his parents\u0027 version is extra sweet due to the antifreeze they keep trying to slip me.Writer, satirist, tiny dancerThere is a pattern: Deny the science, question the motives, exaggerate the costs, help the polluters.

I can only believe it\u0027s because they know that Americans would like what Judge Garland has to say.Vice President, Constitutional Accountability Center (CAC).Although I\u0027m used to politicians wasting my tax dollars, I was shocked to realize that I was voluntarily using my money for this nuclear boondoggle by investing in the very companies that are lobbying for and building new nukes: some of the money in my bank account gets loaned to them and my S\u0026P500 mutual fund invests in them.MIT physicist, author of \"Our Mathematical Universe\"There has never been a lower percentage of college freshmen interested in teaching.
