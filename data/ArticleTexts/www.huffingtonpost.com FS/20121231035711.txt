{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Happy almost-New Year, HuffPosters! May your 2013 be filled with love, laughter, passion and 365 full nights of sleep. Through the years, I\u0027ve discovered something about New Year\u0027s resolutions: while it\u0027s not so easy to keep them, it\u0027s very easy to make them for other people. And a lot more fun, too. So here are some New Year\u0027s resolutions I\u0027d like to hear assorted public figures make and keep: \"I will have caller ID installed in my delivery room.\" ~ Kate Middleton. \"I will enroll in a legitimate Biology 101 class.\" ~ Todd Akin. \"I will take a road trip with my new BFFs Barack and Bruce.\" ~ Governor Chris Christie. \"I will reach the 5th stage of grieving -- acceptance -- about Ohio, and send out a \"Sorry I blew that $300 million\" card to my 2012 donors.\" ~ Karl Rove.Read Post | Comments (63)Robert Kuttner, 12/30/12Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Obama wanted to be the president who would change the tone in Washington, meaning a more collaborative relationship with the Republicans. That was not to be. The Republicans would not allow it.Read Post | CommentsHoward Fineman, 12/30/12Editorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupI\u0027m headed back to Washington knowing what I had guessed when I left town: that the so-called fiscal cliff \"talks\" would still be going when I got home. I\u0027m returning with useful, nagging questions ringing in my ears from Kiwis and visitors alike.Read Post | Comments (83)Jared Bernstein, 12/30/12Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorIf Senators McConnell and Reid hammer out a budget deal that can pass their caucuses, Rep. Boehner is likely to take it up in the House. If it passes there, the president will presumably sign it before the ball drops in Times Square. We will have avoided going over the fiscal cliff, but at what cost?Read Post | Comments (55)Bill Nye, 12/29/12The Science Guy, Partner to SOPHIA.orgRight away, everyone wants to know what\u0027s to be cut. Whatever you all settle on cutting, it should not be science. Investment in science is investment in innovation. New ideas are what keep the U.S. economy driving forward.Read Post | Comments (141)Jill Brooke, 12/29/12Playwright, \"What\u0027s Eating You?\"; Author, \"Don\u0027t Let Death Ruin Your Life\"In reflecting on all the people who passed away this year, I am thinking of Nora Ephron and how this witty, wise and loving woman taught us not only how to live but also how to die.Read Post | Comments (17)Jeffrey Sachs, 12/29/12Director, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \u0027The Price of Civilization\u0027If the deal is reached, the Republicans have won: they have locked in a federal tax system that collects so little total federal revenue that government can afford almost nothing aside from the military, interest payments, retirement programs and health care.Read Post | Comments (909)Eric Boehlert, 12/30/12Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaThe grand experiment of marrying a political movement around a cable TV channel was a grand failure in 2012. But there\u0027s little indication that enough Republicans will have the courage, or even the desire, to break free from Fox\u0027s firm grip on the party.Read Post | CommentsDr. Peggy Drexler, 12/29/12Author, research psychologist and gender scholarPerspectives impact rulings. Understanding other lives is not the forte of homogeneous groups. I am not talking about symbolic diversity. I am not talking about role models and success stories. I am talking about bringing a kind of life perspective to our political representation that will not find its way there on its own.Read Post | Comments (229)Robert Creamer, 12/29/12Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersIf your tax bill goes up $2,200 a year, or you\u0027re one of the millions who would stop receiving unemployment benefits, the cause of your economic pain is Republican fear of being beaten in a primary by people like Sarah Palin, Sharon Angel or Richard Mourdock.Read Post | Comments (189)Carla Buzasi, 12/29/12Carla Buzasi is editor-in-chief of The Huffington Post UKWhen I wrote my end of year blog last December, in my infinite wisdom, I\u0027m fairly sure I declared it the Year of News, impossible to surpass... However, if 2011 kept news editors across the world on their toes, I think it\u0027s fair to say 2012 certainly rose to the challenge.Read Post | CommentsSandip Roy, 12/29/12Culture editor, Firstpost.com; editor, New America MediaShe had no intention to be a braveheart. She didn\u0027t want to become a flickering candle on some dark street corner. She didn\u0027t want to become a symbol. She just wanted to go home. Perhaps tell a friend what she thought of the movie she had just seen.Read Post | Comments (72)James Zogby, 12/29/12President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027As President Obama prepares to launch his second term in the White House, he can take some comfort in the fact that positive attitudes toward the United States have once again risen sharply in several Arab countries.Read Post | Comments (97)Rick Elice, 12/29/12Theater WriterAs if on cue, Tom asks us all into the sunroom. The chairs blocking the doors are removed. We wonder aloud what marvels await us on the other side.Read Post | CommentsErica Cheung, 12/30/12Student/BloggerIt seems snooty to say: \"I am beautiful.\" And in a way, it seems like a lie. If I genuinely think that I am beautiful, I wouldn\u0027t hate dressing rooms and I wouldn\u0027t avert my eyes from the mirror as I squeeze into a sparkly New Year\u0027s dress.Read Post | CommentsScott Mendelson, 12/29/12Film critic at Mendelson\u0027s Memos, Valley Scene MagazineI wrestled with even doing an \u0027overrated\u0027 list this year. First of all, the very idea of such a list is to merely tell other critics and/or the masses that they are dead-wrong for liking something, which I\u0027d argue is very different from telling someone they\u0027re wrong for disliking something.Read Post | Comments (21)Richard (RJ) Eskow, 12/29/12Writer; host, \u0027The Breakdown\u0027; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureApocalyptic prophecies were more plausible than the idea that cutting Social Security will help the deficit, that government spending cuts will jump-start the economy, there were no crimes on Wall Street, or that we live in a \"divided nation\" whose \"center\" wants more business as usual in Washington.Read Post | Comments (25)David Trumble, 12/30/12Award-winning artist, cartoonist and illustratorRead Post | CommentsJudi Casey, 12/29/12Director, Work and Family Researchers NetworkAs someone who has focused her career on how we negotiate our work and family lives, I wonder if information and communications technology encourages us to be more human. In fact, it appears that it\u0027s a mixed blessing with the potential to negatively impact our ability to have meaningful lives and meaningful work.Read Post | CommentsDavid Katz, M.D., 12/29/12Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterHappy ever after is possible after all -- if we tally the reasons for it in one another\u0027s eyes. And remember why we started to keep that tally. And remember to keep on doing so. And remember to remember.Read Post | CommentsTory Zellick, 12/29/12Author, \"The Medical Day Planner\"Sometimes, to be a good caregiver, we have to put our own needs and opinions aside, so as to support our loved one in making their own choice about their own life. Take the example of my mom -- three years into her battle with breast cancer -- deciding to participate in a clinical trial.Read Post | CommentsKenya (Robinson), 12/30/12Performance artist based in New Haven, Connecticut and in Brooklyn, New York.Django Unchained is a film that in spite of, or maybe because of the veracity of its violence, imagines black womanhood™ beyond the superhuman stoic into a paradigm of the pretty.Read Post | CommentsAl Eisele, 12/30/12Editor-at-Large, The HillIt was 40 years to the day since Daniel Inouye had been elected to represent the new state of Hawaii in Congress and he still couldn\u0027t believe his good fortune.Read Post | CommentsDave Johnson, 12/29/12Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureThere is a chance to reform the filibuster in January, with a proposal to \"make them talk.\" Will the Charlie Browns in the Senate let Lucy pull away the football yet again? As George W. Bush said, \"Fool me once, shame on -- shame on you. Fool me -- you can\u0027t get fooled again.\"Read Post | CommentsLouise McCready Hart, 12/29/12Food, fashion writerHoliday season is nearly over and if you\u0027ve enjoyed yourself, chances are your pants are a little tighter than they were earlier this fall. With dozens of cleanses out there, I conducted a side-by-side comparison of several to start the year on the right foot.Read Post | CommentsGary Carter, 12/30/12Chief Operating Officer, FremantleMediaMarriage equality is an elegant, provocative way of challenging nationality and its attendant rights, masculinity and its meanings, and the right to parenthood. In some countries, it challenges that bastion of oppression, organized religion.Read Post | CommentsSean Carman, 12/30/12Environmental lawyer, dabbler in the literary artsI don\u0027t read enough to claim to know the best books of the year, so this is not a definitive \"best of\" list. Instead, it names some of the writing (in whatever form) I most enjoyed this year and that might just be sufficiently out of the way to not have appeared on other lists.Read Post | CommentsEric Levin, 12/29/12Division Head, Techno SourceWhat one may find surprising is the fact that the hottest products in the toy industry right now aren\u0027t technically toys -- yup, that\u0027s right, they\u0027re tablets.Read Post | CommentsCyma Shapiro, 12/30/12New Midlife Mother/Stepmother, Blogger, Writer, BusinesspersonAlthough many new books have been written about reinventing ourselves and taking \u0027me\u0027 time, we do not have the luxury to think about this. As mothers over 40, 50 and 60, I think we darn near \u0027reinvented\u0027 ourselves when we had, adopted, obtained or fostered our children!Read Post | CommentsFood \u0026 Wine, 12/30/12foodandwine.comDisney parks have undergone culinary transformations, becoming destinations that can be equally beloved by families who need quick value-friendly meals and adults who want extended dinners.Read Post | CommentsStephen Weir, 2012.31.12Robert Kuttner, 2012.30.12Zoe P.
