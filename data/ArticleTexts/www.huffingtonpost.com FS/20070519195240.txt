{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"APWe can add two more Bush administration names to the rapidly-expanding \"coulda, woulda, shoulda, but ultimately didn\u0027t resign in indignation\" list: John Ashcroft and Robert Mueller. During this week\u0027s creepy testimony from former Deputy Attorney General James Comey about how Alberto Gonzales and Andy Card made a late night visit to the hospital room of a critically ill Ashcroft to pressure him to sign-off on the renewal of the NSA spy program, came the news that Ashcroft was so uncomfortable with the program he considered resigning. But didn\u0027t. According to Comey, Top G-Man Mueller also considered resigning over the domestic surveillance program. But didn\u0027t.

I\u0027m again calling on our nation to break its silence -- speak out to end this war and bring our troops home.READ POST | comments (88)05.18.2007 Chris KellyWasn\u0027t Saddam \u0027Hitler?\u0027 Once you\u0027ve called someone Hitler and had a war with them, what do you call the next guy? Giant Hitler? Space Hitler? Hitler EXTREME?

But this isn\u0027t about Sicko. It\u0027s about our ailing planet.READ POST | comments (26)05.14.2007 Marshall HerskovitzAs a filmmaker and -- please note -- non-smoker, I need to say something about the current push to make smoking in films a crime punishable by an R rating.READ POST | comments (141)05.19.2007 Donna KaranFor the next two weeks we\u0027re bringing together the world\u0027s leading minds who want to transform the way cancer patients are treated, by looking at the whole process through the lens of the patient.READ POST | comments05.16.2007 Michael GoldfarbSix years into the most disastrous presidency in modern American history, the political class in Washington -- first through fourth estates -- still don\u0027t get it.READ POST | comments (39)05.16.2007 Marty KaplanWhat Giuliani did, in effect, was to borrow Falwell\u0027s attack on liberals and aim it at Ron Paul. It was the kind of Republican indignation usually reserved for straw men, for caricatures of Democratic views.READ POST | comments (187)05.16.2007 E. A. HanksKao\u0027s manifesto highlights just how uninnovative Hillary\u0027s campaign is. Innovation doesn\u0027t come in a pamphlet -- even a $70,000 one -- and it can\u0027t be squeezed into a stump speech here or there.READ POST | comments (27)05.16.2007 Arianna HuffingtonWith the release of the names of the U.S. soldiers missing in Iraq, the story has become even more tragic, and achingly personal.
