{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOWith the Republican caucus in Iowa and the New Hampshire primary, America has now officially embarked on the road to critical presidential and congressional elections in November. Whoever wins will have to lead and unite the nation in order to strike the correct balance in three key economic areas -- and it is possible to do so, although there are no guarantees: between tax and spending reform, between immediate stimulus and medium-term debt and deficit reduction, and between incentives for businesses and stronger social safety nets. But there is another, even more important, yet more tenuous balance that must be struck, and done so in a more explicit and decisive fashion -- that between generations.Read Post | Comments (46)Jason Linkins and Ben Craw, 1/11/12It\u0027s hard to argue that Mitt Romney\u0027s grip on the eventual nomination didn\u0027t grow more certain after last night.
