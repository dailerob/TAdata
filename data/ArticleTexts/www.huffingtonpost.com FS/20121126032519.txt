{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week brought what we hope will be a lasting ceasefire in the Israel-Gaza conflict, the promise of looming conflict in Congress over the fiscal cliff and out-and-out hostility in stores and malls across America as shoppers heckled, scuffled and even wielded weapons in search of Black Friday bargains. Thanksgiving football, meanwhile, served up some early holiday treats: viral gifs of Ndamukong Suh\u0027s \"accidental\" groin kick, and Mark Sanchez\u0027s epic face-in-butt fumble. We were also treated to the decidedly less humorous spectacle of Iraq war cheerleaders like John McCain and Lindsey Graham trying to score political points attacking Susan Rice and demanding \"an accounting\" and answers to \"the basic questions\" surrounding Benghazi. If only McCain and Graham (bellicose backers of a different -- and truly misleading -- serving of Rice) had shown a similar fervor in demanding \"an accounting\" and answers to \"the basic questions\" about how they and their fellow cheerleaders got it so wrong on Iraq.Read Post | Comments (135)Bill Maher, 11/21/12Host of HBO\u0027s \"Real Time with Bill Maher\"I have been mostly holding my tongue about the president this past season, because I didn\u0027t want to muddy the waters in a country where you only get two choices, but Mr. President, there\u0027s no third term. So you may as well throw caution to the wind.Read Post | Comments (2,001)Grover Norquist, 11/21/12President, Americans for Tax ReformFirst, we can and should demand that the negotiations between Congress and the White House be done in front of C-SPAN cameras. Second, once a \"deal\" is agreed to, it should be written down in legislative language and put online for every American to read.Read Post | Comments (1,733)Arianna Huffington, 11/21/12This week, the harried prep for Thanksgiving unofficially marks the opening of the Stress Season that will last through New Year\u0027s Day, when we can officially start feeling guilty about breaking the resolutions we\u0027ll make in response to the stress-induced overindulgence of the holiday season. So how do we change things and give ourselves the gift of mastering our stress instead of being slaves to it?Read Post | Comments (81)Maria Cuomo Cole and Laurie David, 11/19/12Flirtatious emails. Jealous threats. Consensual sex. Scandalous? Hardly. Try... Foolish. Ubiquitous. All too human adult behavior. And frankly none of our business. But here\u0027s what is.Read Post | Comments (349)Jared Bernstein, 11/24/12Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorMany deficit scolds are motivated by anti-tax, anti-social insurance, and anti-government ideology, so they\u0027ve got a vested interest in the status quo. But we\u0027re not going to make much progress if policy makers continue to obsess so exclusively on budget deficits instead of the income deficits experienced by the poor and middle class.Read Post | Comments (1,031)John Schnatter, 11/20/12Founder and CEO, Papa John\u0027sMany in the media reported that I said Papa John\u0027s is going to close stores and cut jobs because of Obamacare. I never said that.Read Post | Comments (7,414)Amy Ephron, 11/21/12AuthorHas anyone noticed that there\u0027s no debate this year? To stuff or not to stuff... To brine or not to brine... Yes, you can fast-cook a turkey at high-heat but should you? I think we all have debate fatigue; election fatigue; Washington gridlock fatigue -- and it\u0027s all somehow spilled over into Thanksgiving.Read Post | Comments (85)James Franco, 11/21/12Actor and authorMy NYU grad students and I presented our collaborative film Tar at the Rome Film Festival.

What\u0027s less obvious is that Petraeus, America\u0027s military golden boy and Caesar of celebrity, was always smoke and mirrors, always the farce, even if the denizens of Washington didn\u0027t know it.Read Post | Comments (285)Mike Rowe, 11/21/12Creator and executive producer, \u0027Dirty Jobs With Mike Rowe\u0027I can\u0027t say that Dirty Jobs never jumped the shark (since I literally leaped over one in season two), but we stuck to the mission statement. We worked hard. And we had a hell of a good time. It was, as they say, a very good run. To everyone, thanks very much.Read Post | Comments (297)Cecile Richards, 11/19/12President of Planned Parenthood Federation of America and Planned Parenthood Action FundThe slow and painful death Ireland\u0027s abortion ban forced Savita to endure brings to mind another tragic story.
