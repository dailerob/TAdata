{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Executive Editor Of Global Spirituality and Religion, The Huffington PostPope Francis, in a powerful speech to the U.S. Congress Thursday morning, used his moral authority to speak out for compassion in regards to immigration, urgency in regards to care for the earth, and dialogue and peace when it comes to foreign affairs. He condemned the military industrial complex while emphasizing a special concern for the poorest among us. He mentioned his care for humans at all stages of life and used that as a springboard to talk about the death penalty. He spoke of his special interest in the family, and used that to launch into his desire for the young to be able to dream. It was a beautiful speech, full of heart for the least of these. However, I think we can lay to rest the idea that this is a pope that has no politics.All Republicans candidates, even those not named Trump, promise to make America great again. That implies, of course, that America is in decline now.

Who occasionally eats too much pizza, gains weight, gets pimples and says the wrong things (for which she can also be programmed to apologize).Best-selling author/corporate training consultantDespite this well-documented need for and benefits of contraception, the Pope opposes any effort to give women the right to control their own reproductive destiny. You cannot claim an affinity for the poor while promoting the very policies that ensure the poor will remain ever so.Scientist and former White House Senior Policy Analyst; Ph.D. in marine biology/neurophysiologyAs you hear a lot of talk in the news about a potential government shutdown, make sure you understand exactly what\u0027s at stake in the broader budget debate.Director of the Office of Management and BudgetDuring the discussion on the Iran nuclear deal, it has been strange to hear U.S. politicians fiercely condemn Iranian human rights abuses while remaining silent about worse abuses by U.S. ally Saudi Arabia.Co-founder, CODEPINK: Women for Peace\"That was after my time,\" Fiorina said.

But, the previous notwithstanding, will they be the first step towards an independent Catalonia?Editorial Director, El Huffington PostIn the midst of all of the accolades, however, it\u0027s easy to forget that the Pope is the head of a multinational religion with 1.2 billion followers and a glass ceiling deeply rooted in sexism.Architect, attorney, badass mother writer and the author of an irreverent novel, Thin Rich Bitches.I was expecting an apologetic, or at least appreciative wave as I stopped to let them pass.
