{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Colonel, U.S. Army (Retired)I am often asked why I remain a member of the Republican Party. My stock answer has become that it\u0027s the party of Lincoln and Eisenhower and I would like very much to return it to similar hands and am working, however infinitesimally well, to do so. Leaving the party would accomplish nothing in that regard. I also contend that there are still sane and sober people -- in the minority to be sure -- remaining in my party. Over the past few days, I have been publicly corroborated by seven such people: Susan Collins, Jeff Flake, Lamar Alexander, Robert Corker, Thad Cochran, Dan Coats, and Lisa Murkowski. These seven senators refused to join the other 47 Republican members of the Senate who made fools of themselves by seeking blatantly to undermine the president\u0027s and the P5 1\u0027s diplomacy to stop Iran\u0027s acquiring a nuclear weapon.Now, I know it may seem crazy to say that a state university cannot constitutionally expel students for such outrageous speech. But the very point of the First Amendment is that the government cannot censor people (including students) merely because it finds their speech abhorrent.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoFor years employers have offered worksite wellness programs, ranging from newsletters or gym memberships to high stakes incentive programs that change your insurance premiums by thousands of dollars if you lose weight, reduce your blood pressure or blood sugar levels, quit smoking or achieve some other health outcome.Professor, McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown UniversityFrank G. Millard Professor of Law, University of MichiganThe Democratic and Republican gristmills got to work last week on Hillary Clinton\u0027s \"homebrew\" email, and the ensuing firestorm underscored an alarming lack of cyber-savvy among the leading players of the 2016 election. It also raised a serious question: Should the Secret Service protect presidential candidates from cyber attacks?Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911The consequences of sabotaging a nuclear deal would be catastrophic. It would isolate America from its closest allies and other world powers. It would free Iran from nuclear constraints and unravel the sanctions without any Iranian concessions. And, worst of all, it would lock the US onto a path towards a disastrous war.Policy Director, National Iranian American CouncilThe last great frontier could be women -- our rights over our bodies, safety and income are under assault around the world and across the United States. Except that LGBTQ people, people of color and women aren\u0027t three disparate groups.Producer, HuffPost LiveHere\u0027s a set of wedding vows with practical merit. They might sound unconventional and unromantic. They\u0027re certainly not poetic, but these promises, if kept, will go far in sealing a marriage for the ages.AuthorThere\u0027s a difference between having your feelings hurt and being systemically denied access to the things you need to succeed in life. You can ask someone five easy questions.Seattle-based writerThe ongoing trade deficit has transferred trillions of dollars out of our economy. It has cost us millions of jobs, tens of thousands of factories and entire industries. As it continues, it is costing us our ability to make a living as a country -- except for our financial sector. This has made a very few people unimaginably wealthy, but it has made the rest of us, and the country, poorer.Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureIn the wake of several years of racial issues on campus, Elliot Spillers\u0027 victory is significant. It can be perceived as a reinforcement of the fact that change at the University of Alabama and other universities across the country is inevitable.Student and campus-editor-at-large, University of AlabamaThere is nothing funny or cool or manly about this type of behavior. Not remotely. And if you are friends or know one of these people -- or people that behave this way, in real life or online -- let\u0027s make sure they know that.The conversation no one else is having.After speaking with a lot of experienced parent friends, I\u0027ve come up with a list of eight things you should never, ever say to your teenager. You may have a completely different list, and that\u0027s fine. There are no easy answers or quick fixes just as there are no perfect parents.Senior Editor, HuffPost 50Regarding the 30,000 emails that you admitted destroying, when did you destroy them, before or after the congress and/or the State Department made their email request to you?Bestselling author of Survival Investing: How to Prosper Amid Thieving Banks and Corrupt Governments and professor of finance at S P Jain School of Global ManagementWhether they know it or not, the ATF\u0027s decision to shelve its new armor-piercing guideline is actually a victory for all of us who want laws to be reasonable, responsible and fashioned to reflect both reality plus a dose of good old common sense.Mike the Gun GuyAs a parent, I can understand the visceral fear of possibly placing your child in harm\u0027s way. But the reality is, you can potentially cause them more harm by not vaccinating. There are many who still see a link between vaccines and autism, but for me and most public health scientists, the jury is out: vaccines are innocent in this matter.Aspen Institute New Voices Fellow, Research Scientist at the University of Michigan School of Public Health and Writer-in-Residence for the Risk Science Center.After I began to use the treadmill, it dawned on me that I could meditate easily on a treadmill because I don\u0027t have to mind traffic or other distractions. I was very happy to find that meditating while running is joyful.Disciple and attendant of Seon Master SongdamWhat Sen. Tom Cotton and his colleagues have done is to strengthen the hard liners\u0027 ability to stop a deal. Let\u0027s remember that if they are successful and the negotiations collapse, the international sanctions will almost certainly collapse as well.Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersI do let a few people in to watch the soundcheck from time to time... We had to cut this particular one short and kick everyone out as Johnny Marr was to get up with us that night to perform The Mighty I. I didn\u0027t want to spoil the surprise for everyone by having some trigger happy social media kid putting it out there...Singer/Songwriter - Noel Gallagher\u0027s High Flying BirdsNo doubt you have many questions about the pro bono-ists\u0027 civil-rights-based challenge to the state\u0027s cap on the number of charter schools. As always, I am happy to shed light.Public education advocate and blogger, EduShysterSometime last year, I complimented a mother on an adorable child who happened to be sporting periwinkle attire. I kindly asked, \"Is it a girl or a boy?\" She looked at me with disgust, and said, \"She\u0027s clearly a girl, look at the color of her clothing.\"Changing the world with violence is destructive and overrated. Change the world with your words.1. The \"job creators\" are CEOs, corporations, and the rich, whose taxes must be low in order to induce them to create more jobs. Rubbish.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027ODS (Obama Derangement Syndrome) won\u0027t work out any better for Republicans in 2016 than ABB (Anyone But Bush) did for Democrats in 2004. Voters still expect you to stand for something not just against whatever the president of the opposing party is doing.Chair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusThere are lots of ways to hold Obama\u0027s feet to the fire, to make the case to the American people that there is no acceptable deal with Iran. Instead, the No Deal 47 are rewriting the constitutional, historical and political norms about foreign policy fights.Senior Fellow, DemosYou need more than intelligence to create a connection with Mother Nature. Many of us have lost that connection and it is reflected in our animals. Dogs are our mirror and when they\u0027re not following us it\u0027s because we\u0027re not balanced.Best-selling author, public speaker, and the internationally acclaimed star of “Cesar 911\" on Nat Geo WILD. http://cesarsway.com/cesarThe United States has done much, since its founding, to earn the decent respect of mankind that the founders felt the country needed. But in directly asking foreign countries to mistrust us, Republicans are, it seems, intentionally trying to throw away what remains of this respect. It is hard to see how this could be good for the country.Arthur Larson Professor at Duke UniversityWith each passing day since these shows were announced, it has become clearer that the \"Fare Thee Well\" concept, ostensibly conceived to pay tribute to a beloved band on the occasion of its 50th anniversary, bears little resemblance to the Grateful Dead.Founder/publisher of Boulder Weekly, an award-winning alternative weekly in its 22nd year of publication.In the last year, young women have moved so quickly past the question of whether or not you\u0027re a feminist to the conclusion that yes, we should all be feminists.Millennial ExpertThe race for Barbara Mikulski\u0027s seat in the U.S. Senate has just begun. But Social Security is already shaping up as a major issue, especially between two leading contenders: U.S. Reps. Chris Van Hollen and Donna Edwards.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourIn hindsight, the digital economy has brought us many wonders. But I\u0027m sad to say that every single \"dark side\" danger I mentioned in 1995\u0027s The Digital Economy has in fact come to fruition. I outlined eight issues. Here are the first four. You decide.Advisor to government and business leaders; Author, The Digital Economy, 20th Anniversary EditionAmericans support trade in general but oppose the NAFTA model of trade that has offshored U.S. jobs, spurred massive deficits, stagnated middle-class wages and contributed to unprecedented levels of U.S. income inequality.Director, Public Citizen\u0027s Global Trade WatchI was raised by one of the most badass women I have ever had the pleasure of meeting -- my single mother. My mother wears all black, can quote Vygotsky and wrote her PhD dissertation when I was in elementary school, while typing on our OG Mac computer.News, entertainment, lifestyle siteGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"\u0027DIRTY BRIGADES\u0027 UNDER INVESTIGATION",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
