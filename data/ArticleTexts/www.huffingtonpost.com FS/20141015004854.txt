{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor at Columbia University and a Nobel Laureate in EconomicsIt used to be thought that America\u0027s greatest strength was not its military power, but an economic system that was the envy of the world. But why would others seek to emulate an economic model by which a large proportion -- even a majority -- of the population has seen their income stagnate while incomes at the top have soared? In the U.S., upward mobility is more myth than reality, whereas downward mobility and vulnerability is a widely shared experience. Those at the bottom are only a short step away from bankruptcy with all that that entails. Illness, divorce, or the loss of a job often is enough to push them over the brink.We need more films with this message. To remind people that behind all the propaganda, ruthless agendas and simple hate, we are all people, sharing 99.9 percent of our DNA.

Friedman is not trying to be funny.Former federal prosecutorPoverty is a shameful and disgraceful fact of life in the United States -- more so than anyplace else because we live in the richest nation on the planet. Yet these issues get far too little attention on the national stage.PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorI\u0027m not sure why some people feel like pregnancy is an invitation to make remarks about a woman\u0027s size, but after three pregnancies, I can attest that this is the case.Founder, The Mom CreativeIn other words, even if we had followed the lead of deficit crusaders like Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson, the deficit would be no lower today. If anyone thought this would make the deficit hawks happy, they are badly mistaken.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027The Philippine grandmaster Wesley So, 21, won the Millionaire Chess Open in Las Vegas and the first prize of $100,000, the largest in the history of open tournaments.International Chess GrandmasterThe reaction of the economic mainstream to the inflationary turmoil of the 1970s was to retreat to an ideological interpretation of their fundamental ideas -- a doctrinaire reinforcement of laissez-faire economics.Author, \u0027Seven Bad Ideas: How Mainstream Economists Have Damaged America and the World\u0027During off-year elections, too many women stay home when their votes are needed. In the last midterm election, 10 million unmarried women who voted in 2008 did not show up! As a result, conservatives swept to power and eviscerated policies aimed at supporting American women, especially in healthcare.Singer; Actress; Director; Composer; ActivistOn the heels of the most impressive win of the Jason Garrett era and of this NFL season, the 5-1 Dallas Cowboys sit tied atop the NFC East after out-Seahawking the Seattle Seahawks 30-23 Sunday.

But this is nothing new.Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersThere was an audible snap in Britain on Monday night. Freed of the burden of saying what Israel and its lobby demanded to hear, politicians of right and left said what they felt.Editor, Middle East EyeThe premiere of a new American opera is always a cause for celebration, and a work for children is especially heartening since today\u0027s youth should be tomorrow\u0027s audience.Arts writer and novelistStriking a balance between humanitarian assistance for developing nations and preserving the resource of healthcare workers will take more than a team of idealistic doctors rushing into Africa with the hope of saving some lives.George E. Wantz Distinguished Professor of the History of Medicine and director of the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of MichiganAs long as we have these issues -- lack of infrastructure, lack of education, lack of access to healthcare, lack of gender equality, and the reality of foreign-imposed restrictions -- then there is going to be another crisis further down the road.Digital Communications and Editorial Manager for the Global Fund for WomenThe modern Silk Road\u0027s establishment will also mark a step toward reinvigorating the ancient Chinese concept of tianxia, in which the Chinese emperor was considered the divinely appointed ruler of the entire known world.Former Indian Minister of State for External Affairs; Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External AffairsIn the past five years, we have committed $33 billion in taxpayer dollars to digitize our nation\u0027s health care data. The need was unquestionable, and the potential gains are tremendous. However, the system that has emerged has essentially replicated the acute care-focused health system that has been failing us for decades.Making the Impossible PossibleI worked at a radio station, a national television network, three local news stations, a reality television production company, a politician\u0027s press office, a weekly newspaper, a national newspaper and at a food start-up. I was also heavily involved in my college newspaper.Writer based in LA and owner of a food tour companyDemocrats in Congress decided not to provide coverage to the estimated 11.5 million undocumented residents in the U.S. Actually, it\u0027d be more accurate to say that many of them were unwilling to vote for a reform bill enabling undocumented residents to buy coverage on the state health insurance exchanges out of fear of jeopardizing their re-election chances.Author, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgOne thing is clear: The foreign armies that the U.S. invests so much money, time, and effort in training and equipping don’t act as if America’s enemies are their enemies.Writer, Professor, Retired Lt.
