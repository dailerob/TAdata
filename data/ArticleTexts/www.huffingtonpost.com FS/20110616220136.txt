{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"I don\u0027t know if you\u0027ve noticed, but the Internet has grown up. Its adolescence was, like most formative years, filled with late nights, video games, loud music, junk food, and trying to figure out exactly what it wanted to be when it grew up. Now, it has matured to the point where our online and our offline lives have merged. Indeed, the qualities we care most about offline are being increasingly reflected in our experience online. We\u0027re leaving behind worshiping at the altar of algorithms and entering a brave new world of community, connections and engagement. Remember all those scary movies about how humans were going to become machines in the future? Well, as it turned out, the machines ended up enabling us to be more human instead.Read Post | CommentsJason Linkins, 06.16.2011Editor, Eat the PressAs Weinergate rages on, the media could not be even remotely interested in hearing what our elected leaders have to say about America\u0027s under-reported unemployment crisis.Read Post | CommentsWolfgang Danspeckgruber and Paul Brandeis Raushenbush, 06.16.2011Religion has an important role to play in these self-determination movements and religious leaders and communities should be part of any international policy calculations towards the region.Read Post | CommentsLarry Flynt, 06.16.2011Publisher of Hustler magazine and free speech advocateAfter having learned of his sudden and compelled resignation from his Congressional post, I would like to make Anthony Weiner an offer of employment at Flynt Management Group, LLC in our Internet group.Read Post | CommentsKristi Blicharski, 06.16.2011President, Bliss Media Public RelationsWorking less and slowing down at the office can lead you to a happier work life.

But this really has more to do with libertarian political ideology than good theology.Read Post | CommentsJared Bernstein, 06.16.2011Senior Fellow, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesWhen you criticize the idea of privatizing Medicare, proponents of that plan\u0027s kneejerk comeback is to claim that Medicare is going bankrupt. They\u0027ve got to break it to fix it. But that\u0027s a misleading non sequitur that should not go unchallenged.Read Post | CommentsJean-François Julliard, 06.16.2011Secretary-General, Reporters Without BordersSince then, 41 local reporters have been killed in Pakistan.
