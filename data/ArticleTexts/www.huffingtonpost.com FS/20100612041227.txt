{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and editor-in-chief of The Huffington PostMonday night in New York, HuffPost will receive a Webby Award as the People\u0027s Voice Winner for Best Political Blog (thanks to everyone who voted for us). As is the tradition at the Webbys, award winners only get five words for their acceptance speeches. Last year, mine was: \"I didn\u0027t kill newspapers... okay?\" In June 2008, my five-worder was: \"President Obama... Sounds good, right?\" And the time before that, my five words were: \"Darlings, make blogs, not war.\" I need to decide what this year\u0027s speech should be, and would love your input. Submit your five-word speech in the comments section of this post. We\u0027ll publish the best ones on Monday. Okay, HuffPosters... start your creative engines!Read Post | CommentsKerry Kennedy, 06.11.2010Founder of the Robert F.

There are no short-term miracles, only the threat of more bubbles if we pursue economic illusions. The watchword must be investment rather than stimulus.Read Post | CommentsMax Bergmann, 06.11.2010Editor, Association FootballU.S. fans know that there are two U.S. teams. One team plays as one and demonstrates the can\u0027t-hold-us-down aggression. And the other team is one that plays as if the game is new to our country.Read Post | CommentsAdam Clark Estes, 06.11.2010Social News Editor at the Huffington Post.Today, we\u0027re unrolling a new and improved set of commenting guidelines to encourage an even more engaging conversation.

I\u0027m not a cynic, but there\u0027s something extraordinarily resilient about Americans\u0027 collective indifference to holding people and organizations accountable.Read Post | CommentsLes Leopold, 06.11.2010Author, \"The Looting of America\"The financial reform bill is virtually designed to institutionalize \"too big to fail.\" And when it\u0027s reconciled we\u0027ll lose another battle in the ongoing war between global financial markets and democratic nation-states.Read Post | CommentsMichael Winship, 06.11.2010Senior writer at Bill Moyers Journal on PBSWe need a constitutional amendment rejecting the anti-democratic course this Supreme Court has chosen. An amendment that establishes an equitable, public campaign financing system that levels the playing field.Read Post | CommentsWilliam Bradley, 06.11.2010California-based Political Analyst NewWestNotes.comWhitman rejected Brown\u0027s call for town hall debates on the illogical grounds that she has a plan and he doesn\u0027t. Huh? If I had a plan and my opponent didn\u0027t, I\u0027d love to debate him. Who wouldn\u0027t?Read Post | CommentsRiki Ott, 06.11.2010Marine toxicologist and Exxon Valdez survivor RikiOtt.comThe Gulf coast\u0027s inconvenient truth: BP -- not our president -- controls the response to the spill. In fact, people on the ground say things are out of control in the gulf, and BP is using federal agencies to shield itself from public accountability.Read Post | CommentsHuffPost Radio, 06.11.2010What do the primaries tell us about the state of politics today, and what do they portend for the November mid-term elections?

It\u0027s those hollow pupils peeking out of the brown death. They are an avian version of the eyes of T.J. Eckleburg that Fitzgerald once wrote about -- and they implicate us all.Read Post | CommentsJames Miller, 06.11.2010Creator, Dissected NewsOn June 12, 2009, Iran\u0027s now infamous elections were held. The idea that the Green Movement would be successful in a few short months is ridiculous -- revolutions are not won in a day.Read Post | CommentsRobert Reich, 06.10.2010Former Secretary of Labor, Professor at BerkeleyThe common wisdom is that excessive debt-financed spending was one of the causes of the recent recession, so the news that household debt is dropping is being celebrated as reason to believe we\u0027re on the mend.
