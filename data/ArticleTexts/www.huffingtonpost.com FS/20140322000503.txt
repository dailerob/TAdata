{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Stephen SchlesingerAuthor and Fellow at the Century FoundationUN Secretary Ban Ki Moon\u0027s trip to Moscow to meet with President Putin yesterday was, at best, an exercise in pro forma UN diplomacy. It seems mostly designed to show to UN member-states that Secretary-General was acting expeditiously to resolve the Crimean crisis but without really advancing any innovative or practical solutions to the dispute. Listen to Mr. Ban\u0027s words to Russian President Vladimir Putin, as reported in the press: let\u0027s protect the Russian minority in the Ukraine; let\u0027s make sure that \"a small incident\" does not spiral out of control; let\u0027s begin a dialogue between Kiev and Moscow. Now no person will disagree with Ban\u0027s sentiments. But given the dire confrontational situation now looming between Europe and the US versus Russia, one might have expected Ban to come forward at this stage in the stand-off.CommentsTEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"Why is it more prestigious to be a CEO than it is to take care of your family? Why aren\u0027t caregivers and breadwinners equally celebrated? And do women actually have more choices than men? Watch this provocative talk from public policy expert, wife and mother Anne-Marie Slaughter.Comments (27)Josh Kilmer-PurcellAuthor, \u0027I Am Not Myself These Days\u0027I\u0027m sending a casserole to Fred Phelps\u0027 daughter, Shirley Phelps-Roper -- a person I\u0027m proud, and somewhat befuddled, to call an old friend.Comments (25)Chi ShermanWriter, blogger, spoken word artistI got laid off from a full-time job due to the belly-up economy. I didn\u0027t realize just how much of my identity I had associated with \"being important\" -- dressing up, interacting with clients, being seen as a professional. Now I was aimless, wearing jeans and flip flops, and worrying about money in a way I never had before.Comments (28)Azie DungeyWriter and star of the two-season hit web series, \u0027Ask A Slave\u0027Reimagining Peter Pan and the character of Tiger Lily presents an opportunity to reform a role that was written in a marginalizing, demeaning way. If we are going to retell these stories, it is our job to do this hard work.Comments (25)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundJo Ann Robinson and other unsung heroines of the civil rights movement remain role models for the tireless indispensable behind-the-scenes leaders whose strength and determination we desperately need right now.CommentsAdam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911Most people assume identity thieves are super-sophisticated hackers sitting in front of banks of blinking computer screens. But sometimes you really never see it coming, and the identity thief who ruined your credit and turned your life upside down is actually your mom or dad.CommentsBrad StulbergPopulation Health ConsultantIt\u0027s time to start thinking about innovation in health care not just as some new fancy machine or surgical technique, but also as how we identify, approach and work with vulnerable people so there is less need to treat them as acute patients.CommentsAdam GrantWharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027Evidence shows that we think we\u0027re superior to others in every domain: We believe we\u0027re smarter, more attractive, more likable, and more skilled at a wide range of tasks, from math to leadership. For a long time, I hoped these narcissistic tendencies wouldn\u0027t extend to the domain of giving and helping. I was wrong.CommentsTom MorrisOne of America\u0027s most active public philosophersWe live at a time that has many of its values positioned upside down. The least important things, we think and talk about the most, while, the most important things, we think and talk about the least. Current values force dedicated teachers, nurses, and blue-collar workers to live in obscure poverty, while young media entrepreneurs and entertainers compete for vast fame and fortune.CommentsRachel Lincoln SarnoffBlogger, Mommy GreenestI believe that we can still support environmental health while remaining pro-vaccine. Isn\u0027t the green movement about questioning preconceptions, seeking out good science, and making better decisions?CommentsJim WallisChristian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersFox voiceovers loom: \"Food stamp abusers, eating on taxpayers.\" Then another, \"America\u0027s poor are actually living the good life\" -- quite a despicable comment revealing the perspective of those who have never lived with, worked with, or even been around poor people in America.Comments (24)Kelly MacLeanStand up comic, actress, writer @thekellymacleanThere are several Geniuses here today, it\u0027s pretty much the same combination of guys you see at any Apple store, in fact I think they\u0027ve franchised this combination: Hipster prodigy kid wearing skinny jeans and Keds; cool, sophisticated black dude with a halfro; hugely beardy questionable hygiene guy; a middle-aged square.CommentsCommittee to Protect JournalistsFor the last decade, Pakistan has been one of the world\u0027s most dangerous countries for the media. At least 46 journalists have been killed, 24 of them murdered for the \"crime\" of covering the intelligence services, the Taliban, separatists in Balochistan, or the criminal underworld.CommentsDee ReneFreelance writer and author in BrooklynI first learned my dad\u0027s birthday when he sent me a request on Facebook. For years, it was one piece of information that haunted me. When had the person that had given birth to me received life? I contemplated it as much as wondering the exact day he decided to leave me behind.CommentsAlan SingerSocial studies educator, Hofstra UniversityContrary to Common Core-aligned curriculum that declares \"free enterprise the pillar of the United States economy,\" I cannot find free enterprise described in any of the \"founding\" documents, or imbedded in the Constitution, of the United States.Comments (15)Paul ReiserActor, writer and standup comedianDave Brenner was in our living room with remarkable regularity, a saturation level I\u0027ve never seen equaled since. He was a guest on the Tonight Show, he hosted the Tonight Show, he was on Merv Grif?n, he was on Mike Douglas (for weeks at a time), he was on game shows... and, it seemed to me, always with new material. That kind of proli?c consistency takes a lot of hard work and dedication -- something I sensed would hit home with my dad.Comments (13)Bob BurnettBerkeley writer, retired Silicon Valley executiveThe Washington conventional wisdom argues the U.S. can\u0027t meet its energy needs, and reduce carbon emissions, without using natural gas as our primary energy source. This perspective has become one of the few points of agreement between Democrats and Republicans.Comments (62)Arthur Chu\u0027Jeopardy!\u0027 champion, voice-over artist, actor, comedianI was, in short, famous. A celebrity. At the apex of my Warholian 15 minutes. And I\u0027m still not sure how the hell it happened.Comments (80)Terry O\u0027NeillPresident, National Organization for WomenYou are going to claim to be pro-life but ignore infant mortality? And maternal mortality? You are going to claim to be confused and worried about the fertilized egg, and the implantation, and the uterine wall, but ignore the intimate partner violence that accompanies unintended pregnancy?Comments (16)Paul Brandeis RaushenbushExecutive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostI grieve for Fred Phelps. The man spent a great portion of his time on earth using his gifts in such a hurtful, and ultimately silly way. But I won\u0027t picket his funeral. I won\u0027t dance on his grave. I will try not to emulate him in any way.Comments (49)James MooreBest selling author, TV political analystThere remain too many similarities between 2014 and 1958 with regards to earning power based on gender and opportunity. Women still earn historically less, even when they are performing the same jobs as men. Current federal law does not deliver sufficient protection against income disparities. Especially in Texas.CommentsDaphne EviatarSenior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstThere are lots of reasons one might be concerned about the severity of U.S. terrorism law. But I wouldn\u0027t expect criticism of this aspect of the American criminal justice system from those law-and-order lawmakers clamoring for the United States to be tougher on terrorism.CommentsMark R. KennedyProfessor of political management and director of the Graduate School of Political Management, George Washington UniversityThe right enemy can be extremely useful to a politician; after all, the nature of the game is to draw contrasts with an opponent. With an adversary as infamous as Putin, it\u0027s easy to reap the rewards.CommentsAnn BrenoffSenior Writer, The Huffington PostI once suggested to my visiting 80-year-old aunt that we could spend the afternoon together shopping. \u0027Why?\u0027 she asked me, \u0027I don\u0027t need anything.\u0027 It was a generational disconnect of the first degree.Comments (48)Annie Lennox and Dr. Mitchell BesserI appreciate my mother and everything she went through. As a woman and mother, I passionately believe that women everywhere in the world deserve access to sexual and reproductive health care.CommentsRichard (RJ) EskowSenior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourMillions are only one or two paychecks away from ruin. Poverty rates have soared. In the midst of misery, more and more of the nation\u0027s wealth is being captured by the top 0.1 percent of earners. And yet, some of the most powerful and wealthy people in America are feeling persecuted.CommentsJim Yong KimPresident, World Bank GroupHere\u0027s a shameful statistic: Up to a third of the world\u0027s food is wasted. In the developing world, that\u0027s 400 to 500 calories per person per day. But in the developed world, it\u0027s as much as 1,500 calories per person.CommentsYulia TymoshenkoFmr. prime minister of Ukraine; Current leader of All-Ukrainian Union \"Fatherland\" (\"Batkivshchyna\")I feel sorry for the people of Russia. They are being led into a totalitarian abyss of economic and spiritual collapse which goes hand-in-hand with poverty and devastation. Using degrading and immoral means, the Russian government has destroyed the notion of truth with their mad propaganda for the occupation of Ukraine.Comments (465)John BrubakerNationally renowned performance consultant, speaker and award-winning authorMy daughter woke me up early one morning smiling and I realized she didn\u0027t care whether I coached or not. Neither did my wife. They just cared that I loved them.CommentsBen HallmanSenior Financial Writer, The Huffington PostRight now is a terrific time to buy a house in many parts of the U.S. -- if you have outstanding credit and a suitcase full of cash. For most everyone else, the market is increasingly out of reach. Here are four reasons why.Comments (437)Kerry L.
