{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"APThis week saw the regeneration of the Democrats\u0027 bicameral backbone, with the historic passage of legislation setting a deadline for the withdrawal of combat troops from Iraq.

Of course, this is the same president who interpreted the 2006 election as a mandate to escalate our involvement in Iraq. Speaking of \"segmented markets,\" I can\u0027t wait to catch George Tenet on 60 Minutes tonight. Judging by his excerpts, his j\u0027accuse of Cheney\u0027s will be, all together now: a slam dunk.READ POST04.26.2007 Paul BegalaPerhaps Broder\u0027s bed-wetting tantrum against Reid was spurred by the certain knowledge that while Harry Reid has been telling hard truths, Mr. Broder has been falling hard for transparent lies.READ POST | comments (232)04.27.2007 Joe ScarboroughHillary\u0027s stock went up a bit and Edwards\u0027 dropped.
