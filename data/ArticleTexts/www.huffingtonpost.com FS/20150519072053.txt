{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-Founder, Democracy PartnersWhy are we to have any faith in the language of these trade deals on labor, the environment, or anything else if the administration won\u0027t enforce the rules of trade that already exist? We have seen examples of the lack of enforcement time and time again over the years on deals relating to China and many other countries. One of the big issues that roiled the Senate vote earlier this week was currency manipulation, and Chinese currency manipulation is the classic enforcement issue most on people\u0027s minds, but it is far from the only one. Elizabeth Warren just issued an incredibly important new report on the lack of enforcement on arguably the most important single issue, labor standards. And one of the most egregious examples of the lack of enforcement of trade rules is the lack of enforcement around the massive subsidies that Qatar and the United Arab Emirates are giving to their countries\u0027 state-owned airlines.I didn’t expect Mad Men to tie everything up neatly — far from it, given what the show has been about for the past seven seasons. But let’s just say that some past season finales were more satisfying and resonant than the series finale was.TV critic, The Huffington PostThe account of unsavory chicanery in high places once again spotlights the deceit that now is the hallmark of how our government works. Here are a few crucial points essential to assessment of Seymour Hersh\u0027s interpretation.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghThere\u0027s a promise we make to the next generation: Graduate from college and you can get ahead. Yet, as we make this promise, public higher education institutions nationwide are facing a troubling trend of disinvestment. Students deserve better, and now is the time to act.President, American Federation of TeachersWhen the Wall Street bubble burst in 2008 because of excessive risk-taking, millions of working Americans lost their jobs, health insurance, savings, and homes. But The Street is back to many of its old tricks. And its lobbyists are busily rolling back the Dodd-Frank Act, intended to prevent another crash.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027According to United Nations statistics, noncombatants are dying in greater numbers every year, with the Taliban and other insurgents responsible for 72 percent of those deaths through suicide attacks and the use of IEDs and other indiscriminate weapons.Senior researcher on Afghanistan at Human Rights WatchUnder my proposal, the district attorneys are given the benefit of the doubt and are not superseded until a reason exists that suggests bias or wrongdoing. However, I would also reform the grand jury system to increase transparency by mandating that in such cases, there is public disclosure of the district attorneys instructions to the grand jury as to which charges they should consider.Governor of New YorkThere are few policies that show the split between elite opinion and everyone else as clearly as trade policy. On trade we see a remarkable convergence of the leadership of both parties against their base, with the elites firmly behind the leadership against what they view as the ignorance of the masses.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027If you watched, you\u0027re surely pondering the meaning of Draper/Whitman\u0027s latest and greatest incarnation as New Age pitchman of killer soft drinks. But I\u0027ve also given a lot of thought to something else: What was Mad Men trying to tell us about America?Author, \u0027Tear Down This Myth\u0027The Boston bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, has been sentenced to death. The 21-year-old man who accompanied his brother on a journey of violence and terrorism will now live out the years of his appeals process until a lethal injection is administered to end his life. Certainly there are no winners.Sass \u0026 SensibilityWhen we talk about all of the problems we have on Earth and the need to solve them, it is only through such AI-human collaboration that we will gain the ability to solve our grandest challenges and truly create a world of abundance.Chairman/CEO, XPRIZEDoes the United States, after years of waivers, bear a responsibility for helping to entrench South Sudan\u0027s practice of using child soldiers?Managing Editor, TomDispatch.comAt the Cancer Prevention Summit on May 20th, 2015, experts in public health will challenge us all to consider what we could be doing better to prevent cancer. Most importantly, we need to commit to a collaborative effort, involving every segment of our society.Board-certified radiologist; Board member, Lesscancer; Author, \u0027A World Without Cancer\u0027Exposés like the Times\u0027 series on nail salon workers, and the other investigative research that came before it, can help shift consciousness. But what\u0027s also required is a power shift. A true transformation will require a broad social movement with the power to bring government back on the side of working families.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027There is too much on the line for us to get caught up with minor differences. From racial disparity to income inequality, immigration reform, marriage equality, fair housing, job growth, pay equity, improved schools and much more, the challenges we face are real, and our commitment must be steadfast.President, National Action NetworkEveryone who has an opinion on the Edward Snowden revelations should watch this film. Everyone who has an opinion on the USA PATRIOT Act should tune in. Disturbed by the National Security Agency\u0027s actions? Check your local listings for when the PBS show Independent Lens airs. I say all this, mind you, before I\u0027ve even seen the film.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comNEW YORK -- Ironically, in this era of exponential growth, we are witnessing the disappearance of cities. Our urbanism is becoming increasingly generic -- a Starbucks on every corner and an iPhone in every palm. We can do better.Distinguished Professor of Architecture, City College of New YorkWe are facing the decimation of entire small town economies, a disruption the likes of which we haven\u0027t seen since the construction of the interstate highway system itself bypassed entire towns. This time, it\u0027s different. This time, there\u0027s no need for entire towns to even exist at all.Writer and basic income advocateLadies\u0027 nights and last-minute dinner plans were easy to accommodate when neither of us had a significant other, but the second a man entered my life I\u0027d become flaky and unreliable, always canceling plans if it meant getting to see my boyfriend.Writer \u0026 blogger with equal passions for metaphysical matters and reality TV. Runs a blog for strong \u0026 sensitive women: scotchandthefox.comAfter the dust-up between Obama and Netanyahu settles, we can expect to add even more steel to our commitment to protect Israel by adding more to its already vast store of sophisticated weapons. Thus, we take another step deeper into the tragedy of U.S. intervention in the Middle East that has become a noxious farce.Jeff Faux, author of The Servant EconomyThis is not our parents\u0027 trade bill. It is not about providing fair trade -- which we all support. Fast track is about pushing through the TPP, TTIP and future trade agreements that would massively increase the power of big corporations and affect the daily lives of Americans. The impacts go beyond job loss -- as serious as that is.U.S. Representative for Illinois\u0027s 9th congressional districtMad Men has everything to do with Ferguson. It has relevance in congressional stalemates, with e-commerce. But perhaps the most perplexing result of the displacing plot techniques of Mad Men is the idea that the show isn\u0027t about men at all -- it\u0027s about American women.Freelance writer, content strategistIt disturbs me that so many people have been hurt by a horrible lie about who Jesus is, and what his church is about. It is up to us to go out there and reclaim, and proclaim the authentic Gospel of love and liberationExecutive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostMeetings may be toxic, but calendars are the superfund sites that allow that toxicity to thrive. I\u0027ve yet to see a résumé -- and I hope I never do -- that lists \"attends meetings well\" as a skill. Yet attending meetings ends up being a key component of many jobs. And it\u0027s stupid.Co-founder, MuleKing performed in Russia, China and Europe, and while in his 80s, he was still playing concerts in Denmark, Germany and France. He was an embodiment of American Soft Power, expressing the vitality and spirit of a diverse nation.Professor of Diplomacy at Occidental College and former US ambassadorThe questions for him are different. The variance is faint, but it\u0027s there, if you\u0027re listening. The comments and questions move on quickly from how he looks to what he can do, which super powers he has.Mother, Writer, AttorneyThere\u0027s a real progressive critique of the Clintons to be made. Hillary is aware of it, and is taking political steps to shore up her left flank. But trying to create a genuine political problem by having right-wingers tweet messages they don\u0027t believe to progressives who know what\u0027s going on? That\u0027s a prescription for irrelevance.Senior Fellow, DemosThere\u0027s nothing on earth that\u0027s more delicious.All things food and drinkCatchphrases were created and run into the ground for fun. I don\u0027t recall a single sentence of any foreign language I ever studied. But I do remember \"too much lotion!\" and \"they pelted us with rocks and garbage!\"Speechwriter and standup comedianEmail\u0027s, texts, and alerts feed your desire to be important, to be loved, and to get good news. It won\u0027t go away if you just stop hitting the button. Instead, you have to learn rewire the whole damn system.Mindfulness thought leader, writer and mindful fitness and habit coachThe Florida senator is the ideal candidate to expand the Reagan coalition while holding on to the conservative base, and he can take shots at Clinton that would sound hypocritical coming from Bush. While his power as a candidate has yet to emerge in the polls, a misstep by Bush will send him straight to the top.WriterGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"IT\u0027S GROUNDHOG DAY!
