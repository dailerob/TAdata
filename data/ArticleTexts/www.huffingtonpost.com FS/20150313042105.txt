Like some invasive species, they infest present-day Washington, where their presence strangles common sense and has brought to the verge of extinction the simple ability to perceive reality. A benign appearance -- well-dressed types testifying before Congress, pontificating in print and on TV, or even filling key positions in the executive branch -- belies a malign impact.

But none of those debates have anything to do with treason, or the so-called Logan Act.Playwright and Political Science Professor; Writing Fellow at Quinnipiac UniversityWhen your spouse no longer knows who you are, should you still be held to wedding vows of \u0027til death do us part?\u0027 Or does death sometimes come in stages, draining away the person you married drop by precious drop?While there are more problems than ever, there are also more solutions.

It is woven throughout the fabric of the City of Boston.54th Mayor of BostonMadonna and many others are intoxicated by the heady whirl of victory -- which the media magnifies in an extraordinary way -- and appear to believe, living within this seductive moment of advances for LGBT rights, that we\u0027ve \"arrived\" and the rest of it is inevitable.Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesGiven that the overwhelming majority of American Jews are Democrats and Obama supporters, Netanyahu (with AIPAC\u0027s connivance) has successfully launched a wrecking ball at the foundation of Israel\u0027s support base in America.Contributor, The NationRepublicans are constantly complaining that President Obama apologizes for this country. What is becoming more and more apparent is that there is a lot to apologize for -- particularly Republicans.Richard Zombeck is a freelance writer for hire and a contributor to www.nowitcounts.comThis controversy is about trust, not the rule of law.
