{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Why Bernanke to succeed Tim Geithner? He is probably the most influential and credible person in official Washington who is not part of the echo chamber on deficit reduction, and a Treasury secretary concerned more about recovery than austerity is just what Obama needs. And because the Fed, almost by definition, is assumed to be conservative, Bernanke would provide some cover for an expansionary program. I can think of people who\u0027d be even better than Bernanke but I can\u0027t think of anyone as good who stands a prayer of being nominated. It\u0027s nothing short of weird when the most reliable progressive in town around turns out to be the chairman of the Federal Reserve. But such are the reactionary times in which we live.Read Post | Comments (232)Marlo Thomas and Sofia Vergara, 11/19/12Hi, it\u0027s Marlo and Sofia -- posting together! Although we appeared in prime time series a generation apart, our TV characters have a lot in common: high energy, endless chattiness and a certain... combustibility. Most important to both characters, though, is the concept of family.Read Post | CommentsDave Bartlett, 11.19.2012Vice President, Smarter Physical Infrastructure, IBMIn the U.S., buildings account for around 40 percent of our energy consumption. Yet, they waste 50 percent of that energy. A depressing set of numbers? To me, it\u0027s an opportunity.Read Post | Comments (2)Wendell Potter, 11/19/12Center for Public Integrity columnist, author, consultantDisruption. Get ready to hear that word many times in the coming weeks, especially if you hang out inside the Washington beltway.Read Post | Comments (254)David Mednicoff, 11/19/12Director, Middle Eastern Studies, UMass-AmherstJust because Israelis and Palestinians have different versions of the same history doesn\u0027t mean that we can compare (and then judge, and even dehumanize) them fairly on particular measures where one side doesn\u0027t measure up.Read Post | CommentsGary Hart, 11/18/12President, Hart International, Ltd.It is impossible to avoid the conclusion that, sooner or later, a great moral confrontation will occur, where right must face wrong, where our unity as a nation will be tested and the need for an Abraham Lincoln will urgently arise. Will he or she be there?Read Post | Comments (204)Daniel Nisman, 11/19/12Intelligence manager, Max Security SolutionsWith each rocket Hamas fires into Israel, they further undermine Egypt\u0027s image as a credible broker, hindering Mr. Morsi\u0027s personal aspirations to restore Egypt\u0027s role as a regional leader.Read Post | CommentsBrian Rooney, 11/19/12Writer and journalistIt\u0027s very serious, but like two high school girls with a romantic interest in the same skinny hipster in the senior class, Israel and Hamas are sending bitchy taunts to each other over Twitter. I don\u0027t know whether to LOL or cry.Read Post | CommentsChris Kelly, 11/19/12Writer, \u0027Real Time with Bill Maher\u0027We need more Petraeus scandal. It can\u0027t be over yet. It just can\u0027t. We\u0027ve got the fort in the South, MacDill Air Force Base. The two officers, Gens. Petraeus and Allen. The two women, Mmes Broadwell and Kelley.Read Post | CommentsLeo W. Gerard, 11/19/12International President, United SteelworkersRepublicans aren\u0027t talking about extending tax breaks for the 98 percent. Instead, they\u0027re threatening the economic life of the country if they don\u0027t get what they want -- tax breaks for people who don\u0027t need them.Read Post | Comments (412)Cecile Richards, 11/19/12President of Planned Parenthood Federation of America and Planned Parenthood Action FundThe slow and painful death Ireland\u0027s abortion ban forced Savita to endure brings to mind another tragic story. Earlier this year, doctors in the Dominican Republic refused chemotherapy to a 16-year-old cancer patient because she was pregnant. Think this couldn\u0027t happen in the United States? Think again.Read Post | CommentsSusan Stiffelman, 11/19/12Family therapist, Author, Parenting Without Power StrugglesAh, the holidays. While many families look forward to reuniting with loved ones, those who have to travel with little ones to get there may approach the season with nothing but dread. Here are some tips that may help you arrive at your destination safe, sound and sane.Read Post | CommentsDavid Katz, M.D., 11/19/12Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterThere is a particular \"Thanksgiving moment\" that occurs as the meal is winding down. I set down my fork -- groan -- and say something like: \"My goodness, I couldn\u0027t eat another bite...\" This, of course, is promptly followed by: \"What\u0027s for dessert?\"Read Post | CommentsChris Jancelewicz, 11/19/12Lead Entertainment Editor, Huffington Post CanadaNo one can ever make movies like Tarantino. Up next is Django Unchained, set for release on Christmas Day. You can spot his movies a mile away, even from one scene, and you can identify traits from film to film, but no one even comes close to capturing the essence of his work.Read Post | CommentsGareth Price, 11/19/12Visiting assistant professor in the linguistics program, Duke UniversityThe curious aspect of U.S. state secession is that the agitation is not to become more Floridian, Tennessean, or Alabamian. Instead, secessionists define their states as more American than America itself.Read Post | CommentsMichael Hogan, 11/18/12Executive Arts and Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post Media GroupAre the writers signaling to us that Nicholas Brody\u0027s days are numbered? It doesn\u0027t seem possible that Showtime would give Damian Lewis the Sean Bean treatment ... But clearly, the countdown to Abu Nazir\u0027s big attack is under way.Read Post | Comments (55)Geoffrey Dunn, 11/19/12Author, \u0027The Lies of Sarah Palin\u0027In case anyone hasn\u0027t noticed, Arizona Senator John McCain has been making a fool of himself lately, on a weekly if not daily basis, his rants seeming to be fueled by an unhealthy mix of anger and envy, with not insignificant hints of racism and misogyny thrown in for good measure.Read Post | Comments (43)Maria Cuomo Cole and Laurie David, 11/19/12Flirtatious emails. Jealous threats. Consensual sex. Scandalous? Hardly. Try... Foolish. Ubiquitous. All too human adult behavior. And frankly none of our business. But here\u0027s what is.Read Post | Comments (93)Marty Kaplan, 11/19/12Director, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolIt is delicious to watch a young conservative apply conservative principles to demolish oligopolistic claptrap, even if those industries finance the campaigns of the members of Congress who pay his salary. It is sad to watch his bosses place fealty to corporate elites above the spirit of intellectual inquiry.Read Post | CommentsMichael Moore, 11/19/12Oscar and Emmy-winning directorThis was truly another historic election and I would like to take a few minutes of your time to respectfully ask that your second term not resemble your first term.Read Post | Comments (415)Richard (RJ) Eskow, 11/19/12Writer; host, \u0027The Breakdown\u0027; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureGotta hand it to \u0027em: Those Wall Street guys are smart. They\u0027ve already found two ways to plunder the nation\u0027s wealth for their own enrichment, and now they\u0027re working on a third.Read Post | CommentsRobert Reich, 11/18/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The best way to generate jobs and growth is for the government to spend more, not less. And for taxes to stay low -- or become even lower -- on the middle class.Read Post | Comments (620)Evan Shapiro, 11/19/12President, Participant TelevisionThere is a perception among many in my cohort and among my elders that the generation currently coming of age -- aka Millennials -- are an entitled bunch of slacker know-it-alls who expect to get medals for just showing up.Read Post | Comments (73)Deepak Chopra, 11/19/12Co-author, \u0027Super Brain: Unleashing the Explosive Power of Your Mind to Maximize Health, Happiness, and Spiritual Well-Being\u0027; founder, The Chopra FoundationGridlock is the political equivalent of a medically induced coma. Basic life functions continue while a critical disease runs its course. Being in a coma isn\u0027t good for anyone, but when the disease is worse, a coma may be the only way to return to health.Read Post | CommentsCraig Kanalley, 11/19/12Senior Editor, Big News \u0026 Live Events, The Huffington PostMy last name is Irish and I\u0027ve long been curious about my roots, particularly my Irish heritage, as I never knew my paternal grandfather. When my Dad found a great deal on a trip for one to Ireland, I felt it was tailor-made for me.Read Post | CommentsEric Zuesse, 11/19/12Investigative historianUnlike Mitt Romney and his plutocratic financial backers, Barack Obama does this sort of thing only because he respects plutocrats, not because he is one. He won\u0027t gain financially by turning this nation into a banana republic.Read Post | CommentsTammy Nelson, Ph.D., 11/17/12Sex and relationship expert; Psychotherapist; Author; International speakerIf monogamy fails more than half of the time, are we looking at a system that no longer serves our needs? Are we holding onto a romanticized notion of love and desire, hoping that we can get it right, but continuing to fail at it over and over again?Read Post | Comments (489)Scottee, 2012.19.11Shirley Conran, 2012.19.11Anne Marie Waters, 2012.19.11Daley James Francis, 2012.19.11James Wharton, 2012.19.11Zion Lights, 2012.19.11Glen Matten, 2012.19.11Mark Perryman, 2012.19.11Her Campus, 2012.19.11Michael Tomaso, 2012.19.11","h1":"HAMAS TO ISRAEL: WE DARE YOU TO INVADEHuffpost Live",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in StyleYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile AppsConnect with your friendsMost Popular on HuffPostDon\u0027t Miss HuffPost Bloggers","h2":"Using a mobile device?
