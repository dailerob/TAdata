{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Chief financial writer, The Huffington PostYes, U.S. gross domestic product shrank in the fourth quarter of 2012. No, it doesn\u0027t mean there was a recession. But simply avoiding a recession is not anywhere close to good enough. There were extraordinary circumstances that made the U.S. economy shrink slightly in the quarter, true. A healthy economy should be able to withstand such blows. The fact that the economy couldn\u0027t hack it highlights the absolute lunacy of Washington\u0027s feverish obsession with budget deficits, and the many risks ahead. It also helps explain why, even as the stock market blows back toward record highs, the Federal Reserve is still pumping cash into the financial system. The Fed, possibly the only entity in Washington that understands that the economy is still on life support, is expected to announce on Wednesday afternoon that it is continuing an aggressive bond-buying program to do its part.Read Post | Comments (310)Matthew Chapman, 01/30/13Writer, director, \"The Ledge\"I am pretty sure I can predict the outcome of the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on guns today. Reason will not prevail. Nowhere in America is anyone proposing a serious ban on weapons, yet gun lovers squeal in hysterical fear and frighten everyone else. It must be a form of Infantile Castration Anxiety.Read Post | Comments (1,006)Ari Melber, 01/30/13Attorney \u0026 Correspondent for The Nation magazineHere is one iron law of the Internet: a social network\u0027s emphasis on monetizing its product is directly proportional to its users\u0027 loss of privacy.

The housing market seems to have rebounded a bit. So why are consumers so glum?
