{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOAs the year comes to an end, dysfunctional Congressional politics continues to dominate the headlines, and rightly so. Our politicians are scrambling to deal with a mess that they created all on their own -- a fiscal cliff that risks pushing the country into recession. And while a last minute \"micro deal\" is still possible, there will be little celebration, nor should there be. Whatever transpires in the next few days, look for politicians to point fingers at each other. If left to fester, the related inability of Congress to step up to economic responsibilities would risk being associated with more than just sluggish growth, persistently high unemployment, and a growing sense of financial discomfort. It would also undermine the country\u0027s longer-term growth potential and, with that, the ability of many citizens to realize the American dream.Read Post | Comments (83)Jeffrey Sachs, 12/29/12Director, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \u0027The Price of Civilization\u0027If the deal is reached, the Republicans have won: they have locked in a federal tax system that collects so little total federal revenue that government can afford almost nothing aside from the military, interest payments, retirement programs and health care.Read Post | Comments (32)Jared Bernstein, 12/29/12Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorI can see a weedy, pot-hole-filled path to a deal before New Year\u0027s. Based on sketchy details I\u0027m picking up in the air, McConnell and Reid are apparently huddling over a deal. If they come up with something acceptable to both of them, McConnell will allow it to come to an up-or-down vote.Read Post | CommentsDr. Peggy Drexler, 12/29/12Author, research psychologist and gender scholarPerspectives impact rulings. Understanding other lives is not the forte of homogeneous groups. I am not talking about symbolic diversity. I am not talking about role models and success stories. I am talking about bringing a kind of life perspective to our political representation that will not find its way there on its own.Read Post | CommentsBill Nye, 12/29/12The Science Guy, Partner to SOPHIA.orgRight away, everyone wants to know what\u0027s to be cut. Whatever you all settle on cutting, it should not be science. Investment in science is investment in innovation. New ideas are what keep the U.S. economy driving forward.Read Post | CommentsGreg Gage, 12/28/12Neuroscientist; Co-founder, Backyard Brains; TED FellowIt is clear that some advances in medical technologies fit the definition of a cyborg. But can the cyborg definition of \"a symbiotic fusion of human and machine,\" be broadly applied to all of us?Read Post | Comments (123)Arianna Huffington, 12/28/12This week\u0027s issue, \"The Year In Photos,\" is a collection of images selected by our photo editors for the way they vividly, and often beautifully, tell the stories that defined 2012 -- the people, events, innovations, triumphs and heartbreaks that shaped our lives. We hope they\u0027ll prompt reflection and provide fresh angles into stories you followed obsessively -- or missed entirely -- in the past year.Read Post | CommentsMarlo Thomas, 12/28/12Award-winning actress, author and activistWe re-elected a president, bought 48 million iPads, dodged a couple hurricanes, obsessed over Tom and Katie\u0027s breakup, and cheered Austrian skydiver Felix Baumgartner, who on October 14 broke the sound barrier in a record-smashing jump from 24 miles up.
