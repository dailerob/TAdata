{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Like the millions of Americans who hit the road this Memorial Day weekend, I also got away for a bit. My travels took me to Providence, Rhode Island to receive an honorary doctorate from Brown University during its commencement ceremony. An honorary doctorate is, of course, only ceremonial, but I actually do feel like I received an education (a compressed one to be sure, but a profound one) courtesy of the astute and moving speeches given by the students chosen to speak at the ceremony -- including one about an epiphany of sorts involving squirrels, whose behavior offers scientific proof of the evolutionary basis of altruism (how\u0027s that for a must-click hook?).

But ever since Obama gave his National Archives Speech, in May 2009, the continuities with Cheney-Bush have been unmistakable.Read Post | CommentsSen. Kirsten Gillibrand, 05.30.2011U.S. Senator from New YorkThe VA\u0027s passive system forces veterans to figure out on their own what benefits they are eligible for. It is outrageous that after all these brave men and women have done for our country that our government allows so many of them to fall through the cracks.Read Post | CommentsAloysius Boyle, 05.29.2011Captain, USMCMinutes passed like hours, 19 years of life slipping away on the Iraq soil, as the distant WHOOMP of the helicopter neared. My mind raced, yet I wasn\u0027t really thinking. All I remember is asking God to never, ever let me forget how I felt that day.Read Post | CommentsDavid Coleman, 05.29.2011Public Defender (Ret.) and Adjunct Law ProfessorThe path of least resistance seems to be the best response to a police request to examine a car, at least until the officer discovers a text message from a drug-using associate, or contact information about someone who is under suspicion.Read Post | CommentsT.J.

The existence of evil means that war may always be an ugly necessity. But these days most of Washington\u0027s conflicts are wars of choice, military interventions for almost any reason other than protecting vital American interests.Read Post | CommentsDorian de Wind, 05.29.2011Retired U.S. Air Force OfficerWe have come a long way in one short year towards eliminating barriers that have prevented too many of our service men and women from serving to their full potential -- sometimes even from serving.Read Post | CommentsSam Harris, 05.30.2011Author, NeuroscientistThe concept of free will is a non-starter, both philosophically and scientifically.

Either that, or we\u0027re not going to get the economy we want.Read Post | CommentsBill Lawson, 05.29.2011National President, Paralyzed Veterans of AmericaThey shed their blood for freedom. Their families live with these sacrifices. And too often we forget that freedom isn\u0027t free. For those of us who served and live every day with our injuries, these selfless heroes will forever be our inspiration.Read Post | CommentsRobert Naiman, 05.30.2011Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicyYou can\u0027t claim solidarity with Egyptian protesters when they take down a dictator, but act horrified that the resulting government in Egypt, more accountable to Egyptian public opinion, is more engaged in supporting Palestinian rights.
