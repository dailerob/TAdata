{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Dan Glickman is Vice President of the Aspen Institute and Senior Fellow at the Bipartisan Policy CenterGreat presidents get big things done by recognizing that continuous work with Congress is perhaps their foremost duty and best use of their time. It is a central element of their job description; notwithstanding that it is often part of their job that they least like doing. Other presidents like LBJ, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton understood that the tedious and often unpleasant work of engaging with Congress is the only way to lead this country forward. After all, the Founding Fathers created a system where the Congress and the Executive were co-equal branches of government.

What\u0027s less obvious is that Petraeus, America\u0027s military golden boy and Caesar of celebrity, was always smoke and mirrors, always the farce, even if the denizens of Washington didn\u0027t know it.Read Post | Comments (115)Christy Turlington Burns and Erin Thornton, 11/20/12Without transport, women can\u0027t get to a healthcare facility unless they walk.

Gould, 11/20/12Rat-lover, insatiable reader, campaigner, Beethoven groupie, writer, and tattooed ladyOnce upon a time there was a thing called foreplay. Sometimes it was silent: just a kiss in a club and an awkward scuffle in the toilets. Others took more time with it.
