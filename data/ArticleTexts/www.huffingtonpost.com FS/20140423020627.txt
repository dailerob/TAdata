{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Bill MoyersManaging Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyAt state and local levels, while the poorest fifth of Americans pay an average tax rate of over 11 percent, the richest one percent of the country pay -- are you ready for this? -- half that rate. Now, neither Nature nor Nature\u0027s God drew up our tax codes; that\u0027s the work of legislators -- politicians -- and it\u0027s one way they have, as Chief Justice John Roberts might put it, of expressing gratitude to their donors: \"Oh, Mr. Adelson, we so appreciate your generosity that we cut your estate taxes so you can give $8 billion as a tax-free payment to your heirs, even though down the road the public will have to put up $2.8 billion to compensate for the loss in tax revenue.\" All of which makes truly repugnant the argument, heard so often from courtiers of the rich, that inequality doesn\u0027t matter.Would you do this to your own mother? Would you starve her, ravage her, drill her, strip her, pollute her, poison her, frack her, crowd her, pave her, drain her, extract her, constrain her, imprison her?Jamie Lee CurtisActress and children\u0027s book authorIn 2008 Oprah and the spiritual teacher and author Eckhart Tolle held a number of conversations as part of their Web series Oprah \u0026 Eckhart Tolle: A New Earth. Now they\u0027re bringing those episodes to television for the first time, Sundays at noon on OWN, the Oprah Winfrey Network. Since my new book Thrive is concerned with many of the same questions, I asked Tolle about the series, why this is a conversation we as a society need to have now, and the moment he knew he needed to change his life. Here\u0027s our conversation.Arianna HuffingtonFor the last thirty years, almost all the incentives operating on companies have been to lower the pay of their workers while increasing the pay of their CEOs and other top executives. It\u0027s about time some incentives were applied in the other direction.Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Jon HotchkissCreator, ThisvsThatShow.comI want to talk about the fallout when senior management chooses to politicize their brands.

Redemption. Resurrection. Faith. I leave Haiti with these gifts in abundance.Kerry KennedyPresident, Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human RightsIf we want to counter the rise in inequality that we have seen in recent decades we are going to have to find other mechanisms for reversing this upward redistribution than a politically infeasible global wealth tax.Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027The BP spill should have been a wake-up call for elected officials and organizations tasked with responding to this type of disaster, but it seems like those in charge of protecting our waters have learned nothing.Mark RuffaloScott SmithJohn L. PrattI wish I could tell you that I\u0027m killing it at dating right now, but the truth is I\u0027m still terrified I\u0027ll always be living under the shadow of my rape.Jessie KahnweilerFilmmaker; Comedian; AquariusHow does a font become so hated?Gerhard BachfischerCourse Director/Lecturer, Visual Communication, School of Design at University of Technology, Sydney (UTS)The threat that female toplessness and self-articulated nudity poses is culturally defined and can be culturally redefined so that people recognize that the offense to morality is misogyny, not nudity.Soraya ChemalyFeminist, Writer, Satirist... not always in that orderThe show will go on. Sooner or later, though -- after exhausting all possible format gimmicks -- the higher-ups at NBC may finally realize they chose the wrong guy to host.Chris WeigantPolitical writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comUnderlying the Earth Day agenda is a growing sense that tomorrow\u0027s economies -- and tomorrow\u0027s capitalism -- must be very different.Jochen ZeitzJohn ElkingtonIt would be too easy to wash one\u0027s hands and blame politicians for their failure to address climate change. Any failure would be collective. Responding to climate change is everyone\u0027s responsibility.Jimmy CarterMary RobinsonThis will not be the last time someone discounts my son because he is different. It will not be the last time someone makes a joke at his expense, but to actively seek out actual people to tease goes beyond cruel. It\u0027s inhuman.Megan Davies MennesEnglish teacher, writer, motherIs there such a thing as having too much talent? This is the perennial question facing the owners of big-time sports franchises -- not to mention the managers and coaches and players and fans. Does adding more and more talent add up to ever better team performance?Wray HerbertAuthor, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027You see, this is actually a critique of the trend of the open letter, in all of its asinine inescapability. #Sorrynotsorry, dear reader -- it\u0027s the nature of the open letter to trick you into reading it.Sarah ThomasWriter, Writing Instructor at Columbia UniversityThe Bush presidency involved running riot over international agreements and the very foundations of the U.S. and virtually nothing happened. The Obama presidency has seen these policies continued or extended with both implicit and explicit statements that there would not be any pursuit of justice against those who offended it so deeply.Jack HealeyFounder, Human Rights Action CenterExecutive Editor, Jill Abramson, is a front page story herself: After 160 years of men filling that prestigious post, Abramson broke the glass ceiling in 2011 with her landmark appointment, having spent her 35-year career at the Times and elsewhere as an investigative reporter, editor, bureau chief and Managing Editor.Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistLindsey BestFine art and music photographerAt the Border Security Expo, Mark Borkowski, assistant commissioner for the Border Patrol\u0027s Office of Technology, Innovation, and Acquisition, isn\u0027t talking about the deaths and abuses along the border, or the firestorm of criticism about the Border Patrol\u0027s use of deadly force.Todd MillerWriter, \u0027Border Wars\u0027I\u0027m tired of being told the key to success is to change. Man up. Woman down. Instead, corporations could join the 21st century and see \"female qualities\" as virtues.Angelina ChapinBlogs Editor, Huffington Post CanadaWith every Indiana miss, every questionable coaching decision or substitution by Frank Vogel and every lackluster defensive possession, the concern mounts.Jordan SchultzThe Huffington Post\u0027s sports columnist, The Schultz ReportIf we can develop a better system to engage, empower and enable our children to innovate faster than our world systems decay, then our kids could not only save our world, they could reinvent our future!Ravé MehtaCEO, Helios Entertainment; author, \u0027The Inventor: The Story of Tesla\u0027Over the span of 60 years, he\u0027s battled Earthlings, space monsters and robots, spawned offspring and chased Matthew Broderick, all while belting out the most iconic roar in film history. But the monster\u0027s origin story may actually blow your mind.Kevin LankesFreelance writer, author and bloggerEverything depends on whether Tehran, and not just President Hassan Rouhani, is serious. No surprise, many analysts -- and more importantly, paladins of Capitol Hill -- remain skeptical.
