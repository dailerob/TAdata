{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, as I was in London for the launch of HuffPost UK, Britain\u0027s phone hacking scandal mushroomed from journalistic black-eye to a crisis engulfing the UK\u0027s most powerful institutions. You know a scandal has reached critical mass when people start asking of those at the top: \"What did you know and when did you know it?\" So far, Rupert Murdoch is standing by right-hand gal Rebekah Brooks, while David Cameron, who is close to Brooks and had made the now-arrested former News of the World editor Andy Coulson his communications director, felt compelled to toss his chums under the double-decker bus. Big Society, small world. Although filled with journalists behaving badly, it\u0027s important to remember that it was journalists, especially the Guardian\u0027s Nick Davies and Amelia Hill, who diligently stuck with this story for years and brought it to light -- something the political elite and the paid-off police wouldn\u0027t do. Keep checking out HuffPost UK for the latest twists and turns.Read Post | CommentsEd Miliband, 7/7/11Leader of the oppositionThe latest disclosures about how people working for the News of the World apparently hacked into the phones of Milly Dowler and the families of 7/7 victims have triggered nationwide disgust. It is at times like these that people look to their Prime Minister to face up to the challenges presented, without fear or favour. I am afraid that yesterday David Cameron did not rise to that challenge.Read Post | CommentsTracey Ullman, 7/4/11Actress, comedianArianna, I know you say you feel at home here in the UK, having gone to Cambridge and dated Bernard Levin and all, but if you think you get flack in the USA at times, it\u0027s nothing to what the Brits will hurl at you.Read Post | CommentsDavid Bromwich, 7/3/11Professor of Literature at YaleOver the past decade we have taken many long steps across the divide that separates a republic from an empire. The recovery of our proper ground depends on our seeing for ourselves the rightness of Abraham Lincoln\u0027s recoil from wars that are not wars of necessity.Read Post | CommentsArianna Huffington, 7/6/11We are arriving in the UK in the midst of a rich and thriving media culture marked by great innovation.

Kennedy Jr., 7/6/11President, Waterkeeper Alliance; Professor, Pace UniversityThe House of Representatives today is swinging a sledgehammer at a cornerstone of contemporary American democracy and undermining the most extraordinary body of environmental law in the world.Read Post | CommentsJared Bernstein, 7/8/11Senior Fellow, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesThe June jobs report reveals a much more serious job creation problem in this country than most policy makers realized. Over the past two months, job creation has essentially ground to a halt, with 25,000 jobs added in May and 18,000 in June. The unemployment rate, now 9.2%, is climbing. Washington needs to quickly and aggressively shift from its long-term debt obsession to the much more immediate jobs problem. To do otherwise at this point would be deeply irresponsible.Read Post | CommentsEve Ensler, 7/6/11Author of \u0027I Am An Emotional Creature\" and \"The Vagina Monologues,\" Founder of V-DayThe Strauss-Kahn case is not about winning or losing, but opening a dialogue on rape, violence and gender.Read Post | CommentsRicky Gervais, 7/5/11Comedian and writerI had David Brent as a character from about 1995 I\u0027d say. (The first \"sketch\" I had for him was basically the scene where he interviews his new secretary in episode 5.) And he is based on people I\u0027d met throughout my adult life.Read Post | CommentsMarlo Thomas, 7/3/11Award-winning actress, author and activistWe Americans like to talk about our nation\u0027s early history, and how the great experiment of our democracy continues to grow and mature with each passing decade. We\u0027re proud of our country\u0027s many-colored population, our very special Melting Pot.Read Post | CommentsJon Favreau, 7/6/11Actor, writer, directorRead Post | CommentsDavid Lohr, 7/7/11Senior Crime ReporterIt has been almost three years since I sat down at the computer and typed my first article on Casey Anthony. Little did I know, then, that I was about to be sucked into something that would hover over my life like a dark cloud for years to come.Read Post | CommentsDelia Lloyd, 7/8/11American writer based in LondonI firmly believe that you need to check your own biases, so I\u0027ve assembled five intelligent arguments I\u0027ve come across recently about the relative merits of gaming. I don\u0027t buy into all of them hook, line and sinker, but all gave me pause.Read Post | CommentsMarcus Samuelsson, 7/5/11Chef; Author, \"New American Table\"Salad can get a bad rap. People think of bland and watery iceberg lettuce, but in fact, salads are an art form, from the simplest rendition to a colorful kitchen-sink approach.Read Post | CommentsNeil Barofsky, 7/7/11Former Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP)The most striking lessons from the financial crisis and its aftermath already appear either to have been forgotten or to have never been learned. The American financial system can still be brought to its knees by the poor decisions of a small group of executives.Read Post | CommentsMichael Roth, 7/9/11President, Wesleyan UniversitySensible government seems to have become a contradiction in terms.

Concentration Camp Liberator Discovers a Legacy of Trauma\u0027The president clearly believes we need to remove the stigmas of war\u0027s mental health consequences.
