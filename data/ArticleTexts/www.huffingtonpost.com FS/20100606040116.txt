Instead of sealing ourselves away behind cultural borders, we need more ships carrying hope to suffering strangers.Read Post | CommentsRobert Redford, 06.04.2010Actor, Director, and Environmental ActivistDocumentary filmmakers\u0027 success as storytellers depends on access to those who are willing to talk on camera. If the subjects of hard-hitting films are fearful of the ramifications of telling the truth then the filmmaker has no story.Read Post | CommentsDiana Butler Bass, 06.04.2010Author, A People’s History of Christianity: The Other Side of the StoryThis week, dueling pastoral letters from Rowan Williams, the Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury, and Katharine Jefferts Schori, the Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church, caught my attention.Read Post | CommentsJohn Kerry, 06.04.2010U.S. Senator from MassachusettsToday, we stand at the crest of a demographic wave that will transform the early 21st century, particularly in the Arab world with the so-called \"youth bulge.\" We must embrace this wave to better U.S.-Arab relations.Read Post | CommentsDr. Larry Dossey, 06.04.2010Former Chief of Staff of Medical City Dallas Hospital; author of \"The Power of Premonitions\"Will the gadgets make it easier for these kids to take the next step and grok the deep oneness of consciousness of which the great traditions have spoken for millennia?Read Post | CommentsLarry Magid, 06.04.2010Technology journalistWe need to go beyond worrying about predators and pornography and start thinking about young people as true citizens in an online environment where young people are just as likely to create content as they are to consume it.Read Post | CommentsCecile Richards, 06.04.2010President, Planned Parenthood Federation of AmericaThis is finally the moment to address a fundamental problem facing millions of American women: they need birth control, but for too many women it is not easily accessible or affordable.Read Post | CommentsChris Durang, 06.04.2010Playwright and ActorThe Oil Spill isn\u0027t only about climate change. It\u0027s about greed, it\u0027s about assuming the worst won\u0027t happen, it\u0027s about refusing to discuss how to wean ourselves from oil.Read Post | CommentsLes Leopold, 06.04.2010Author, \"The Looting of America\"Senator Judd Gregg thins that the way to create jobs is to get those lazy workers off the dole so that they can help lower wages across the economy.
