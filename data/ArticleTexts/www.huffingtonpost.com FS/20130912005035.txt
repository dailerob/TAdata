{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Peter S. GoodmanExecutive Business and Global News Editor, The Huffington PostWe will not forget the things we are officially called on to remember today -- how the hijacked jets demolished the landmark towers that had seemed permanent, the helpless people plunging to their deaths before our eyes, the young children whose parents disappeared forever. You remember. We all remember, anniversary or not. It\u0027s what happened after that day that we need to recall with import, how we used 9/11 as a jumping off point to one of the most wasteful, pointless and destructive dozen years in American history, embarking on foreign military misadventures abroad while shredding civil liberties at home -- all in the name of strengthening the very national security we undermined.Comments (502)Nathan GardelsEditor, NPQ, Global Services of Los Angeles Times Syndicate/Tribune MediaAssad can only keep his promise as long as he is in power. He must stay in power as long as it takes -- and in the US we have been dismantling our chemical weapons since the Nixon era.Comments (198)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Forbes Magazine, which calls itself the \"capitalist tool,\" seems to have a penchant for publishing right-wing diatribes posing as serious economic analyses. The latest is by Paul Roderick Gregory.Comments (793)Dale FavierWriterI\u0027ve been a massage therapist for many years now. I know what people look like. People have been undressing for me for a long time. I know what you look like: a glance at you, and I can picture pretty well what you\u0027d look like on my table.Comments (170)Donna Marsh O\u0027ConnorMember, September 11th Families for Peaceful Tomorrows; Mother, Vanessa Lang Langer, WTC Tower II, 93rd floorUnder any circumstances, we must not continue the wars begun in my daughter\u0027s name and in the names of those countless and uncountable who surely left broken hearts and souls to mourn here on Earth.Comments (48)Laura MunsonAuthor, \u0027This Is Not The Story You Think It Is: A Season of Unlikely Happiness\u0027I\u0027ll admit it: I have been afraid to go to Ground Zero. Since 9/11/01 I\u0027ve probably been to New York City 10 times. I have no excuse but just what I\u0027ve said -- Fear. Fear of what? The horror? Empathy? Sympathy? My imagination? The human heart? That there would be an element of voyeurism? That somehow it wouldn\u0027t be memorialized in a way that felt reverent? Then I met Christie Coombs.Comments (11)Robert CreamerPolitical Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersFor those who do not want to see the use of military force in Syria, the best thing they can do to assure that the military action is not needed is to support the Congressional resolution authorizing the president to use military force if necessary.Comments (194)Dan DennettCognitive scientist and philosopherLeon Wieseltier sees that the humanities are in a deep crisis, but his essay, \"Crimes against the Humanities,\" is not a helpful contribution to its resolution. Name-calling and sarcasm are typically the last refuge of somebody who can\u0027t think of anything else to say to fend off a challenge he doesn\u0027t understand and can\u0027t abide.Comments (139)Adam GrantWharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027We\u0027re often shocked by what people post online. What shapes why some people seem to have no filter in social media, whereas others are more selective and private -- and what should your strategy be?CommentsDaniel WagnerCEO, Country Risk SolutionsThere is good reason to believe that Mr. Assad is serious, and that he will do his part to make the decommissioning of Syria\u0027s chemical weapons arsenal a reality. But a number of things stand in the way of making this proposal meaningful.Comments (49)Kenneth Barish, Ph.D.Clinical Associate Professor of Psychology at Weill Medical College, Cornell UniversityWe want children to have their feelings, but not be overwhelmed by them -- to feel discouraged but not give up; to feel anxious but not stay home; and to be excited but not get so carried away in their enthusiasm that they use poor judgment in making decisions.Comments (33)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesLGBT politicos are in denial if they don\u0027t see this race as a harbinger of the future, in New York and throughout the country. It was a reflection of the advances that the LGBT community has made in New York, with LGBT voters rejecting simplistic identity politics and voting on broader issues.Comments (16)Elad NehoraiPop ChassidNow that I\u0027ve tried to change the way I look at love, the more I become shocked at the messages of love I had gotten when I was younger.CommentsPeter DreierE.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeAbout 300 residents packed the six hour long meeting -- held at the Richmond Memorial Auditorium instead of the City Council chambers -- to discuss the city\u0027s plan to help families whose home values have plummeted through no fault of their own.CommentsArianna HuffingtonIn practically every religious tradition and practice, giving of oneself is a key step on the path to spiritual fulfillment.Comments (140)Sally SteenlandDirector, the Faith and Progressive Policy Initiative, Center for American ProgressTwelve years after that terrible September day, it is worth recalling the premise of the choice presented to us -- safety versus civil rights -- because it was false.CommentsChief Warrant Officer 4 Clifford BaumanUS Army National GuardTucking the box in the closet, as if the memories would remain trapped inside, I spoke about the events to no one. At that time, I had no idea I was on a path to self-destruction or how much my life would change over the coming year.CommentsSteve RosenbaumCEO, Magnify.net; author, \u0027Curation Nation\u0027; NYC entrepreneur at largeOn the TED stage I asked the question: \"Where were you on 9/11?\" Soon, we\u0027ll all have a place to answer that question.CommentsWray HerbertAuthor, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027Poverty is emotionally crushing, and stigma only adds to that burden. The poor are often disparaged as lazy and incompetent -- unable or unwilling to improve their own lot. Why don\u0027t they make better decisions for themselves?CommentsJeffrey SachsDirector, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \"To Move the World: JFK\u0027s Quest for Peace\"\"Peace,\" he emphasized, \"is a daily, a weekly, a monthly process, gradually changing opinions, slowly eroding old barriers, quietly building new structures. And however undramatic the pursuit of peace, that pursuit must go on.\"CommentsLincoln MitchellHarriman Institute, Columbia UniversityToday, after a Democratic primary in which the strongest Bloomberg critic of all the candidates won a resounding and broad victory, a different picture of Bloomberg\u0027s mayoralty, one that is grounded in his less successful third term, is emerging.CommentsGwen CooperAuthor, \u0027Homer\u0027s Odyssey: A Fearless Feline Tale, or How I Learned About Love and Life with a Blind Wonder Cat\u0027Probably no part of Homer\u0027s Odyssey has provoked more outraged response than the chapters dealing with 9/11 and my attempts to rescue my three cats who were trapped in my apartment mere blocks from Ground Zero.CommentsJeff JarvisAuthor, \u0027Public Parts\u0027 and \u0027What Would Google Do?\u0027On that day a dozen years ago, I held hope that the tragedy would unite Americans to stand against tyranny and for democracy and freedom. Today I see a nation that is not upholding the principles of freedom but is instead still using 9/11 as an excuse.CommentsAngelina ChapinBlogs Editor, Huffington Post CanadaWith demands to boycott everything from the Sochi Olympics to the novel Ender\u0027s Game to the entire state of Florida after the George Zimmerman verdict, people continue to insist abstention is a prescription for change. But saying you plan to effect change with your boycott is kind of like saying you\u0027re moving to Hollywood to become famous. Only your mother will believe you.Comments (33)Sec. Kathleen SebeliusSecretary of Health and Human ServicesPresident Obama and the entire Obama administration have made prevention and public health a top priority because of the lasting effects they have on the health of Americans.Comments (31)Terry StradaFundraiser, Justin\u0027s Hope FundI had spoken with my husband Tom, and I heard the fear and screams in the background. I saw the images on TV of his building engulfed in flames. All those innocent people trapped above the point of impact in the North Tower had no chance of survival -- no chance of rescue.Comments (16)Matt FrazierVegan marathoner; Author, \u0027No Meat Athlete\u0027Let\u0027s face it. Being vegan (or even vegetarian) is pretty weird. But that\u0027s okay -- weird is the new cool. Being weird, I\u0027ve found, is not just fun; it\u0027s addictive.Comments (29)Diana Butler BassAuthor, \"Christianity After Religion: The End of Church and the Birth of a New Spiritual Awakening\"Taken together, the Niebuhrs represent a tension at the heart of American liberal democracy: the desire to stand against evil decisively versus the need for self-reflection central to a moral community.Comments (30)Alan ColmesLiberal political commentator, host of \"The Alan Colmes Show\" on Fox News Radio, publisher of alan.com, author of \"Thank the Liberals … For Saving America\"Dignified and respectful quietude speaks much louder than pomp and circumstance when it comes to remembering those who died. \"Never forget\" is correct. But the place to remember is in our hearts, not in lavish ceremonies.Comments (102)Tanya Villanueva Tepper9/11 widow living happily \"even\" after as wife, mother, speaker, writer, and advocate.This day is also about remembering the heroes who are still here, who touched our lives and held our family up as we struggled to process our enormous loss and rebuild our lives in the years that followed.CommentsDennis J. KucinichFmr. 16-year Member of US Congress; Two-time US Presidential CandidateWe\u0027ve seen this movie before and it doesn\u0027t end well. A decade after the Bush administration used the CIA\u0027s \"yellow cake\" tale and other faulty evidence, the government is yet again relying on the CIA to lead a domestic propaganda effort for military action in Syria.Comments (435)AlaskaDispatch.com, 2013.11.09Imbibe, 2013.11.09Lucas Handy, 2013.11.09Adam Grant, 2013.11.09Brian Silverman, 2013.11.09Franco Lania, 2013.11.09Leah Bhabha, 2013.11.09Rev.
