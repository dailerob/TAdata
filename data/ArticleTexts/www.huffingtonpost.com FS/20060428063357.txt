{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"From news.yahoo.comAPFrom The ConcordiensisWatching United 93 is like being punched in the gut. In a good way. The film actually delivers a cathartic cinematic trifecta: the punch in the gut is accompanied by a jolt to the brain, and a fullness in the heart. This is an unforgettable film. As the chilling, soul-wrenching, and unglamorously heroic events play out, the controversy that has surrounded the film -- is it too soon? is it exploitative? -- seems ludicrous. Too soon? It\u0027s been nearly five years since the terrorist attacks. Exploitative? What is exploitative is the way the events of 9/11 have consistently been exploited for political purposes.READ POST | comments (26)04.27.2006 Shayana KadidalIn every case challenging NSA surveillance, the government is filing briefs and evidence that it says are so secret they can\u0027t even be seen by the lawyers for the other side.READ POST | comments04.27.2006 Bill RobinsonThe face of Thursday morning\u0027s enemy is Dr. Marcella Meyer, the Kraft shareholder who tried to bully the company, by proxy, to revoke its support for the Chicago Gay Games.READ POST | comments04.27.2006 Paul RieckhoffFor most people, the war in Iraq is a distant event with remote, intangible costs and consequences.
