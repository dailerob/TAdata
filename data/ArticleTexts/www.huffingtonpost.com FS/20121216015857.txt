{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Children\u0027s Defense FundOnce again we are faced with unspeakable horror from gun violence and once again we are reminded that there is no safe harbor for our children. We have so much work to do to build safe communities for our children and need leaders at all levels of government who will stand up against the NRA and for every child’s right to live and learn free of gun violence. But that will not happen until mothers and grandmothers, fathers and grandfathers, sisters and brothers, aunts and uncles, and neighbors and faith leaders and everybody who believes that children have a right to grow up safely stand up together and make a mighty ruckus as long as necessary to break the gun lobby’s veto on common sense gun policy. How young do the victims have to be and how many children need to die before we stop the proliferation of guns in our nation and the killing of innocents?Read Post | Comments (645)Peter S. Goodman, 12/14/12Executive Business Editor, The Huffington PostIn every country, some people are disturbed, broken-hearted or angry enough to murder. What is special about this country is the extent of the damage that such people are able to inflict when the urge comes.Read Post | Comments (3,631)Janet Echelman, 12/14/12ArtistThere\u0027s just one thing I\u0027d like to clarify. It sounds like I\u0027m railing against the establishment, and their mistake of rejecting me. But here\u0027s the thing -- I don\u0027t think they were wrong.Read Post | Comments (59)James Zogby, 12/15/12President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027The lights will, for a time, go out in Newtown. And in the Christmas\u0027 to come there will always be an emptiness and a sense of loss. We can pass legislation, and we must, but it will always be too late for the lost children and grieving families of that wounded community -- and this, we should never forget.Read Post | Comments (18)Thrity Umrigar, 12/15/12Author, \u0027The Space Between Us\u0027Don\u0027t participate in any ritualized expressions of public grief. There have been so many of these already this year. The point is, they don\u0027t help. They don\u0027t change the laws of the land, they don\u0027t weaken the NRA, they don\u0027t frighten the cowardly politicians into action. They change nothing.Read Post | CommentsRev. Emily C. Heath, 12/14/12Clergy, United Church of ChristGod just needed another angel. Portraying God as someone who arbitrarily kills kids to fill celestial openings is neither faithful to God, nor helpful to grieving parents.Read Post | Comments (276)Rana Florida, 12/15/12CEO, The Creative Class GroupTwenty-seven dead, 20 of them children, 10 days before Christmas. Two dead in an Oregon mall earlier this week. How many times does this have to happen before we realize that an unrestricted right to bear arms is ludicrous?Read Post | Comments (143)Geoffrey R. Stone, 12/14/12Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoThis line is not always easy to draw, but it is easy in Welch. What the state is regulating in the context of SOCE is not the speech of the therapist as such but the use of a method of therapy.Read Post | Comments (26)Edward J. Blum, 12/14/12Associate Professor of History, San Diego State UniversityThe thought that God perhaps has a plan amid the Connecticut shooting sickens me as well.Read Post | Comments (191)Rabbi Michael Lerner, 12/15/12Editor, Tikkun MagazineWe need a fundamental transformation as well as banning guns. Otherwise, we will now revert to the normal debate between liberals wanting more gun control and conservatives saying that it\u0027s not guns that kill, but people. Both are right.Read Post | CommentsMelissa Sher, 12/14/12Writer and blogger, Mammalingo.comMy son\u0027s class performance this morning -- before I read the news -- feels like it happened weeks ago. What happened in Sandy Hook Elementary is unspeakable; and yet, if we don\u0027t speak up, we are closing our eyes to the problem.Read Post | CommentsBetsy Brown Braun, 12/14/12Child development and behavior specialist, author, wife, mom, granny and friendUnless your child has been exposed to this incident -- by radio, TV, Internet or overhearing your loose talk -- there is absolutely no reason to bring it up to him. Period.Read Post | CommentsTammy Duckworth, 12/14/12Congresswoman-elect for Illinois\u0027 8th DistrictUnder current law, if a servicewoman becomes pregnant as a result of sexual assault and chooses abortion, her military health insurance will not cover it. As a combat veteran and newly elected member of the House of Representatives, I ask Congress to repeal this discriminatory ban.Read Post | CommentsMichael Wolkowitz, 12/14/12Former Chair, The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun ViolenceOne thing I am rather sure of is that we will hear words like \"nothing like this ever happened in this community before.\" They said that after Columbine. They said that after Virginia Tech. They said that after Tuscon. They said that after Aurora. They always say that.Read Post | Comments (416)Susan Stiffelman, 12/14/12Family therapist, Author, Parenting Without Power StrugglesWe are all reeling today in the aftermath of the school shootings in Connecticut. It is impossible to imagine the impact on the families who lost children, those whose children were spared but so profoundly traumatized and the rest of us who bear witness from afar to the unthinkable.Read Post | Comments (43)Charles Karel Bouley, 12/14/12On-air host, KGO Radio; TV personality, comic, author, actor, writer/producer/director and dog walkerToday, the sad fact is that all we can do is grieve. Lawmakers can\u0027t agree on how to keep the nation\u0027s finances moving, let alone how to solve the gun crisis.Read Post | Comments (251)Lisa Belkin, 12/14/12Senior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, The Huffington PostWe are heartbroken, yes. But saying that will fix nothing. We can\u0027t just grieve and hold our children close. We have to demand that our country earn the right to call itself a civilized nation.Read Post | Comments (1,728)Robert Walker, 12/14/12President, Population InstituteObserving a never-ending political silence about new gun laws will do nothing to diminish the victims\u0027 sorrow; it will only ensure that others will suffer a similar fate.Read Post | Comments (198)Devon Corneal, 12/14/12Lawyer, MotherEvery day we send the most vulnerable members of our society their classrooms, and they\u0027re turning into shooting galleries. A place that was supposed to give children a sense of stability did exactly the opposite.Read Post | Comments (275)Dr. Heidi Horsley, 12/14/12Grief ExpertToday\u0027s tragic events at the Sandy Hook School will require a lot of caring for the surviving children. Here is a list of my advice on how to cope with trauma involving youth.Read Post | CommentsElamin Abdelmahmoud, 12/14/12WriterA little child who has just experienced a tragedy like this doesn\u0027t need a microphone in his or her face. What we don\u0027t want is the use of little children as a means of getting viewers. Those children need love and care first. The story should always come after.Read Post | Comments (40)Arianna Huffington, 12/14/12In this week\u0027s issue, Saki Knafo and Lila Shapiro put the spotlight on Staten Island, telling the story of how Hurricane Sandy collided with one man\u0027s version of the American Dream. And Jason Cherkis and Zach Carter write about a potential shakeup in the music world: a controversial merger that would give Universal Music control of 40 percent of the industry.Read Post | CommentsJody Becker, 12/14/12Journalist, FilmmakerIt\u0027s not just today; I often wonder why parents don\u0027t reject the glorification of the gun and violence culture more actively.Read Post | Comments (29)Brian Levin, 12/14/12Deconstructing politics, policy and current eventsMust we treat the Constitution, and its Second Amendment, as static and sacrosanct, as the bloodshed spirals onward? From a historical perspective, the answer is no.Read Post | Comments (85)Michael B. Keegan, 12/14/12President, People for the American WayAnybody who was paying the least bit of attention to this year\u0027s elections would have noticed that two of the things voters find most repugnant about today\u0027s GOP is its blind allegiance to big corporations and its enthusiasm for regulating women\u0027s health. Apparently the Republican Party wasn\u0027t paying attention.Read Post | Comments (236)Mark Osler, 12/14/12Professor of Law, University of St. ThomasThe ethic of revenge is contrary to the teachings of every major religion, and the fact that it has become a central tenet of our public morality represents a failure of our faith leaders.Read Post | Comments (58)Robert Scheer, 12/14/12Editor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027What is protected in the First Amendment is not the right of commercial enterprises to exploit the news for profit, but rather of citizens to become informed. That requires the courage of heroic sources, including Bradley Manning.Read Post | Comments (314)Ethan Nadelmann, 12/14/12Executive Director, Drug Policy AllianceAnytime the president answers a question about marijuana and federal marijuana policy, as he did in a recent interview with ABC\u0027s Barbara Walters that airs tonight, it makes sense to parse his words.Read Post | Comments (275)Chris Jancelewicz, 12/14/12Lead Entertainment Editor, Huffington Post CanadaThe Hobbit is enjoyable on every level -- from story to cinematography to the performances -- and despite the inherent nerdiness of the franchise, even the non-geeks among us can identify with the triumphs of a small man over big foes. If you still have no desire to see it, here are 26 reasons why you should re-consider and give it a chance.Read Post | Comments (24)Jess Coleman, 12/14/12Student, Binghamton UniversityThe constant \"thoughts and prayers\" for the victims are surely comforting, but they are far short of a serious solution. If our leaders truly want to lead, it\u0027s time they put the lives of their voters before the fears of their advisors.Read Post | Comments (60)Ralph Nader, 12/14/12Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorDespite the prescient warnings of past presidents, who were also leading generals, the expanding war industry is now militarizing our public budgets, foreign policy, civil liberties and commercial culture as never before.Read Post | Comments (84)Marsha Temlock, 2012.15.12Molly Hahn, 2012.15.12Carla Buzasi, 2012.15.12Thrity Umrigar, 2012.15.12Blakeley Decktor, 2012.15.12Robyn Bourgeois, 2012.15.12Georges Ugeux, 2012.15.12Sir Peter Westmacott, 2012.15.12Rabbi Michael Lerner, 2012.15.12Trevor Neilson, 2012.15.12","h1":"CHARLOTTE BACON DANIEL BARDEN RACHEL DAVINO OLIVIA ENGEL JOSEPHINE GAY ANA G.
