{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027As you have doubtless read or seen, Michael Bloomberg, former Mayor of New York, has put out the word that his minions are testing the waters for an independent candidacy. Bloomberg is supposedly the sensible moderate that the county needs, the one that political polarization has kept from the ballot of either party. But that\u0027s not an obstacle that a few billion dollars from the candidate\u0027s own fortune can\u0027t fix. Here\u0027s the problem. Bloomberg is center-right on economics and finance, and liberal on social issues and gun control. There is no clamoring for such a combination, except among fellow rich people. But if the Republicans nominate Trump, Bloomberg might capture a good slice of the moderate suburban vote -- even more so if Democrats choose Sanders. Don\u0027t we need just such a moderate? No, we don\u0027t.A well-timed yes can expand our world in beautiful and unexpected ways. But I am writing now to espouse the power of another simple word: no.Actor, Author, Screenwriter, Director and ProducerWe all strive for success, even though what that means for each of us is going to be different. That\u0027s why I\u0027m delighted to announce HuffPost Endeavor, a new section in partnership with Chevy Malibu. HuffPost Endeavor will be a place to both celebrate success and redefine it, by reminding ourselves what it really means to live a good life, to place the satisfaction that comes from hard work and accomplishment alongside the joys that come from small moments, pauses and meaningful connections.Can we bomb a movement that has no nation but definitely has a strong belief system, like we used to have? Haven\u0027t we learned that every bomb creates terrorists?Actor; Founder, The Dreyfuss Civics InitiativeMichigan didn\u0027t have to poison Flint\u0027s children. That was a values choice. And Republican Gov. Rick Snyder values big business more than little children.International President, United SteelworkersThe conversation around Tonya Pinkins and Mother Courage desperately needs to be broadened. To an extent, the question of whether Pinkins\u0027 decision was \"professional\" is irrelevant. Activism is inherently unprofessional. Without disruption, there is no activism.Artist, activist \u0026 intersectional feministThe upcoming election isn\u0027t about detailed policy proposals. It\u0027s about power -- whether those who have it will keep it, or whether average Americans will get some as well.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027Few would dispute the significant advances Tunisians have made towards democratization since escaping Ben Ali\u0027s dictatorship in 2011. But these accomplishments have remained elitist matters, viewed with apathy by the wider population.British Tunisian writer and Middle East expertThis wasn\u0027t an acid flashback, although to my ears it sounded like one. Several months ago, I was with 27,000 people screaming for a disheveled 73-year-old Senator from Vermont. He didn\u0027t look like Mick Jagger. But what Bernie Sanders says feels like the truth. The unbridled truth. And he says it LOUD.Founding member of The DoorsWhat do Hillary and the Wall Street bank discuss that\u0027s worth over $200,000 an hour? And what does Goldman Sachs, and other Wall Street firms who have paid Hillary $2.5 million in the past two years, expect in return? If you ask Hillary, you\u0027ll never find out.Entertainment attorney, producer, writer and political activistIt seems so unreasonable when you put it that way: My wife left me because sometimes I leave dishes by the sink. But when you choose to love someone, it becomes your pleasure to do things that enhance their lives and bring you closer together, rather than a chore.Writer, single dad, amateur therapist, bad Twitter user. Likes: Funny stuff, books and not divorcing. Blogger at MustBeThisTallToRide.com.Surveillance is about power. Vigilant gives the NYPD power to monitor our whereabouts. By demanding answers to critical questions about NYPD\u0027s use of surveillance tools, New Yorkers can begin to take back the power imbalance created by the new era of mass digital surveillance.Senior Staff Attorney, the New York Civil Liberties UnionDemocratically elected officials were displaced and replaced with emergency management people who cut a deal and sent contaminated river water that corroded pipelines and exposed residents to toxic levels of lead. Gov. Snyder\u0027s administration ignored this problem since 2014, and in terms of direct action, politics and policies, the Flint crisis might just be even worse than Katrina.President, National Action NetworkWhile Syriza created neither the economic crisis nor the refugee crisis, its incompetence and opportunism have worsened their impacts on Greece and have undermined the country\u0027s position within Europe.Associate Professor in the School of Public and International Affairs at the University of GeorgiaHillary Clinton is wrong when she says that Medicare for all is not achievable. In fact, if she and her husband had embraced the concept in 1993, we would be nearly there today.Founding Co-director, Social Security WorksIf we\u0027re lucky, the day will come when we look back at the Iowa caucuses and the quadrennial carnival they inaugurate with the same embarrassed horror we now feel for duck-and-cover as a safety drill for nuclear war.USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorDonald Trump doesn\u0027t speak for me, and his statements do not represent the Dordt College I\u0027m committed to. Look, I\u0027m no expert in marketing, but this type of publicity can\u0027t be good.Associate professor of theology, Dordt CollegeYour boss tells you that you look nice in that dress, asks you to do a spin. Just to get the moment over with, you do. Wait. This story sucks. If it were one of those Choose Your Own Adventures, here\u0027s where you\u0027d want to flip back, start over, rewrite what happens to you.WriterI find it appalling that J\u0026J, Vitality, and Novo Nordisk advocate expensive and intrusive regulations subjecting huge numbers of employees both to institutionalized discrimination, and to programs that they admit don\u0027t work, simply to make a few bucks.CEO, www.quizzify.comVeterans who have willingly given so much in service to their country should not have to bear the burden of being further stigmatized by your ignorant and foolish statements.Risk management and security expertIn September 2015, Saudi aircraft killed 135 wedding celebrants in Yemen. The air strikes have killed 2,800 civilians, including 500 children. Human Rights Watch charges that these bombings \"have indiscriminately killed and injured civilians.\"Professor, Thomas Jefferson School of LawAs Egypt\u0027s central security chief declared they \"will not allow another revolution,\" the hashtag \"the people demand the downfall of the regime\" quietly became the top trending topic in the Arab Twittersphere.Writer; Arab Spring activistIt\u0027s not that I don\u0027t think Bernie can win, it\u0027s that I don\u0027t want him to. While Hillary\u0027s plans might be less ambitious and less progressive on most points, I believe that the actual ground that she will gain is greater than the actual ground that would be gained under a Sanders presidency.Just a Rachel Maddow wannabe.This desire by the government to cast a wider net to identify and respond to \"suspicious behavior\" has only heightened the risk of unfair and unjust targeting of marginalized individuals.Activist, blogger, waylaid CalifornianThe tragedy of Flint should never have happened, but at this point, the evidence is undeniable and the suffering is real. Fixing Flint is an urgent priority. Fortunately, (although far too late) the truth has finally sidelined the spin-masters who spent years denying the problem.Executive Director, In the Public InterestI believe we\u0027re ready to be liberated. But for this to take place, for any change to take place at all, people have to see and admit the ugly situation that surrounds them first.Student at the University of Toronto, specializing in Political Science, and majoring in Professional Writing and Communication. Associate news editor at the University of Toronto Mississauga\u0027s (UTM) newspaper \"The Medium\" and a collective editor at \"Mindwaves and Compass.\" She also serves as vice president of the UTM Liberals Club and external vice president of UTM\u0027s Egyptian Students\u0027 Association.Out of the woodwork we now have a major gun-control voice joining up with Gun Nation to proclaim that the assault weapons ban was a dud.Mike the Gun GuyThere are many ways in which homeless (and other low-income) students are continuously marginalized while in college. Kicking students out of their dorms with unrealistic housing alternatives only emphasizes that, at certain institutions, these students are not a priority.Current New Yorker. Proud Texas Aggie.It is precisely because we can\u0027t stop globalization that we should have more rules in place to protect working families, not just here in America, but all over the world. And for those who suggest that it isn\u0027t possible, be clear on one thing: They are saying this to help the big businesses who exploit those workers.Co-Founder, Democracy PartnersOn January 15, 2016, a case was unsealed and the complaint made public. The case was an inside whistleblower case against ITT Technical Institute.Get Out of Debt GuyHere are 10 success skills you probably weren\u0027t taught, but are completely essential to happy living:Master Certified Coach and founder of Good Vibe UniversityGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
