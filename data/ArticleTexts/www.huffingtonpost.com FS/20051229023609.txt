{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"From asoldiersview.comAll this week, along with our new posts, we\u0027re featuring some of our favorite blog posts from the past year. Enjoy this blast from the HuffPost past -- and be sure to check out The Blog for the latest current takes from our bloggers, including Jesse Kornbluth on the real gift of Christmas, RJ Eskow\u0027s Democrats: Losers or Victims?, and Eric Fischl\u0027s George Talks to God.READ POST | comments12.28.2005 Stephen KausThe first of what undoubtedly will be several minor wing-nut sites are already trumpeting a new poll as showing that the public supports what Bush has done and the Democrats are barking up the wrong tree.READ POST | comments12.28.2005 Steven G. BrantI hope, if he doesn\u0027t go so far as to demand an apology, former president Clinton at least issues a statement regarding what he would have actually done if 9/11 had happened on his watch.READ POST | comments (53)12.28.2005 Martin GarbusAs Bush and his colleagues seek to minimize the vast amount of data collection, the lies will necessarily expand to cover the wrongdoing. Bush can be brought down.READ POST | comments (127)12.28.2005 Robert ScheerWe regularly hector the world as to the virtues of a government held accountable by a free press and yet routinely mock that ideal with media that often act as nothing more than a conveyor belt for government propaganda.READ POST | comments (38)12.28.2005 Nora EphronFOOD vanishes. I don\u0027t mean food as habit, food as memory, food as biography, food as metaphor, food as regret, food as love, or food as in those famous madeleines people like me are constantly referring to as if they\u0027ve read Proust, which in most cases they haven\u0027t. I mean food as food.READ POST | comments12.28.2005 Jay RosenObviously there are things the Times learned that it cannot tell us about the NSA, and about its conflicts with the Administration. This may account for some of the silences and gaps.READ POST | comments (11)12.28.2005 Jane HamsherIn placing themselves at risk to expose government misdeeds, whoever leaked the NSA wiretap qualifies as a \"whistleblower\" under this definition in a way that Rove, Libby et. al. explicitly do not.READ POST | comments (50)12.28.2005 Michelle PileckiThe story is getting more play outside the US than in, but credit the Chicago Tribune\u0027s John Crewdson for a Christmas Day present to news junkies and a delicious scoop on CIA bungling.READ POST | comments (29)12.28.2005 Steve AndersonI am no fan of the way record companies do business, but one point needs to be hammered home again and again: stealing is stealing.READ POST | comments (49)07.07.2005 Simon JenkinsThe terrorist wants everyone to feel perpetually terrorized, to look askance at every Arab faces and dress, to overreact, cut and run for cover from the world.READ POST | comments (13)07.02.2005 Lawrence O\u0027DonnellI revealed in yesterday\u0027s taping of the McLaughlin Group that Time magazine\u0027s emails will reveal that Karl Rove was Matt Cooper\u0027s source. I have known this for months but didn\u0027t want to say it at a time that would risk me getting dragged into the grand jury.READ POST | comments (303)08.07.2005 Paul BegalaPerhaps the charge is a criminal cover-up -- obstruction of justice, perjury, conspiracy or lying to a federal investigator. What does the President do? What does he say? As a former White House speechwriter, I\u0027ve taken the liberty of drafting the speech for Mr. Bush...READ POST | comments (105)07.14.2005 Mike McCurryI was the press corps pinata for President Clinton during four zesty years that included l\u0027affaire Monique. Sometimes it is the chosen assignment of the White House Press Secretary to go out and get whacked, over and over, to see if anything interesting will spill out...READ POST | comments (70)07.01.2005 Christopher GuestIn my family, the tradition of the Fourth of July is a cherished memory. While my father read aloud from P.G. Wodehouse, my mother supervised...READ POST | comments (24)07.20.2005 David MametHe: Huh...and that\u0027s why a dalmatian... She: It was either that or a Sardine. I love this joke, particularly as I do not believe that Dalmatia and Sardinia are, in fact, contiguous. And I think that one of them, in fact, may be an island.READ POST | comments (20)08.11.2005 Norman LearNo American -- let alone a Gold Star mother -- is required to agree with every decision her president makes in order to secure her good name as a citizen and as a supporter of our troops and our country.READ POST | comments (134)07.15.2005 Bill MaherA couple of months ago, an Alabama congressman was trying to get me fired for saying on \"Real Time\" that, as far as recruiting went, we\u0027d \"done picked all the low-lying Lynndie England fruit.\"READ POST | comments (70)07.31.2005 Arianna HuffingtonEver since I started blogging about Judy Miller’s role in Plamegate (and in the selling of the war in Iraq), I’ve been showered with tips and tidbits about Miller. A recurring theme in many of these conversations and e-mails is how Judy, to the dismay of many of her colleagues, never played by the same rules and standards as other reporters.READ POST | comments (98)07.11.2005 Adam McKayImmediately after the London bombings I overheard someone say, \"See! That\u0027s why we\u0027re in Iraq!\" It knocked the wind out of me. We\u0027re into animal response territory here. Like when you try and help a scared dog and it bites you. The whole world has become a threat. Things are blurry.READ POST | comments (29)07.22.2005 Robert F. Kennedy Jr.Wednesday night, Jon Stewart asked me on his program to discuss my recent Salon.com/Rolling Stone articles about the federal government\u0027s efforts to conceal the overwhelming scientific evidence linking vaccine preservative thimerosal to the epidemic of neurological disorders among American children.READ POST | comments (128)07.27.2005 Michael SmerconishIt’s not McDonalds, Starbucks, lap dances and Brittany Spears – offensive though Muslims may find those hallmarks of American life. And it’s not about converting us to Islam. To the contrary, says Scheuer, what motivates radical Islam is American foreign policy.READ POST | comments (71)08.01.2005 Alan DershowitzCertain right-wing rabbis consider Sharon a traitor and they want him dead. But they don’t want to do what Yagal Amir did to the late PM Yitzak Rabin – namely, kill him at the hand of a human being.READ POST | comments (35)08.02.2005 John FundIsn\u0027t it about time that the Beltway media turn ever so slightly away from their obsession with Karl Rove and ask a few questions about journalists involved in the Plame story who are not named Robert Novak?READ POST | comments (30)07.20.2005 Mario Batalithe shrimp on the grill bush denies the terra\u0027s heat crustaceans cannotREAD POST | comments (11)07.07.2005 Marty KaplanThe blanket coverage of London terrorism is a terrible blow to Nancy Grace, Arubans, meteorologists, shark specialists, sexual predator experts, Tom Cruise, creationists, anti-sodomites and all other culture warriors and whackball fear-mongers who until now have owned the media.READ POST | comments (21)07.16.2005 Paul FeigYou remember the game of Clue, right? Well, instead of the board being a representation of a mansion, pretend the board is instead a map of Washington, DC. Using your love of intrigue and deduction, try to figure out who the second source for the Valerie Plame leak is.READ POST | comments (38)07.18.2005 Sherry LansingDay in and day out for the last month, I have been inspired by the passion and engagement of just about everyone I have met in Israel. Would our survival need to be at stake for the average American to tune in and pay attention to policy?READ POST | comments (20)08.01.2005 Rep. John ConyersThe method: ignoring information that conflicted with the preferred narrative that Saddam Hussein had WMD and smearing anyone who espoused such heresy in the hopes that the smear would deter other whistleblowers from coming forward.READ POST | comments (39)08.01.2005 James MooreI don\u0027t care how many awards Judy Miller has, she is a miserable failure who has irreperably harmed her country with bad journalism and by allowing her own personal beliefs to infect her reportage.
