{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorToday\u0027s employment report shows steady employment growth, fast enough to keep the jobless rate from rising, but not fast enough to knock it down much. The main, first-take point here is that this is a glass-half-full, glass-half-empty jobs report, and more broadly speaking, job market. In the near term, market and political volatility over the recent fiscal craziness is not particularly evident in the job market, which has been moving along at about a trend growth rate. Uninspiring -- and not fast enough to provide the opportunities we need, but steady and pretty resilient to everything from Congressional wound-infliction to hurricanes. Still, we\u0027re growing at a steady pace and the last thing we\u0027d want to do is screw around with the debt ceiling... right?Read Post | Comments (160)Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor, 01/04/13National Spokesperson, Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center; Author, NYT Best-seller \u0027My Stroke of Insight\u0027The issues of mental health and global health are closely linked -- if not one and the same. Similar processes we use to improve our mental health can help us make better, more responsible decisions as a society -- by focusing on the compassion and integrity of our right brain, rather than the judgment, punishment and deception of our left brain.Read Post | Comments (132)Mohamed A. El-Erian, 01/04/13CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOThe December employment report released this morning confirms that the labor market continues to heal. This is good news. The challenge now is to consolidate the improvement. For that, politicians need to overcome self-made problems; also, and critically, they need to stop creating new ones.Read Post | Comments (49)Gary Hart, 01/04/13President, Hart International, Ltd.Disaster relief, including for Hurricane Sandy, is government spending. It is no worse, but also no better, than meals on wheels for the elderly, school breakfast for poor children, unemployment compensation and rent subsidies. All are government spending and all are \"about human beings.\"Read Post | Comments (40)Marlo Thomas, 01/04/13Award-winning actress, author and activistAs we settle into the new year, it\u0027s a great time to be pro-active and get a jumpstart on spring-cleaning your home. Our friend Maxwell Gillingham-Ryan from Apartment Therapy gave us some great ideas how to clean, re-organize, de-clutter and revamp your home right now.Read Post | Comments (54)Robert Redford, 01/04/13Actor, director and environmental activistThis is a time for climate leadership. So, instead of a shoddy Keystone XL environmental review, the first major climate action for this Administration\u0027s second term should be to set limits on climate change pollution from power plants. That is the kind of action that makes sense.Read Post | Comments (257)Cherie Blair, 01/04/13Founder, Cherie Blair Foundation for WomenIn the holiday spirit of peace on Earth and good will toward men, I would argue that more good will toward women, notably in terms of education, would contribute to more peace on Earth.Read Post | CommentsDavid Westin, 01/04/13Author, \u0027Exit Interview\u0027; Former President, ABC NewsThe sale of cable news network Current TV to Al Jazeera has raised more than a few eyebrows. But whatever comes of it all, the creation of this alternative to CNN and Fox News and MSNBC shows just how much has changed in the news media since Peter Jennings left us just seven years ago.Read Post | CommentsPaula Davis-Laack, 01/03/13Lawyer turned stress \u0026 resilience expertSince graduating with my master\u0027s degree in positive psychology, I\u0027ve worked with and observed thousands of people in a wide variety of settings, and happy people just flow with the groove of life in a unique way.

That\u0027s nonsensical. We need to put more money into the pockets of average workers, not less.Read Post | Comments (335)Marian Wright Edelman, 01/04/13President, Children\u0027s Defense FundWe all measure our accomplishments and shortcomings in different ways. Some people count numbers on a scale or in a savings account. But what if we decided to take stock as a nation by measuring how we treat our children?Read Post | CommentsSeth Abramson, 01/03/13PoetAs the years go on, critics will return to the first entry in The Hobbit trilogy with a more favorable tone than they have approached it with thus far, and will be embarrassed for having rated it barely above George Lucas\u0027 thoroughly execrable Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace.Read Post | Comments (789)Robert Naiman, 01/04/13Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicyWhy not Paul Krugman?

I will give John Singleton his respect. But directors such as Tyler Perry and many others who continue to profit from such slander and stereotype of the black population should be held responsible for such backlash that comes from Django.Read Post | Comments (288)Sandy Weiner, 01/04/13Chief Love Officer, Last First DateI don\u0027t care how old or out of shape you are, how dismal your relationship past has been, or whether you think you live in a town without any eligible singles.
