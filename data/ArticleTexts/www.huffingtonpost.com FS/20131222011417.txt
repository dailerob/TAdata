{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoThe use of government surveillance to protect the nation against terrorist attack is deeply polarizing. On the one hand, there are those who fervently defend everything the Intelligence Community does. How, they ask, in the light of 9/11, can anyone want to handcuff the Intelligence Community in its critical effort to protect our nation against potentially catastrophic terrorist attacks? It is reckless and irresponsible, they charge, for anyone to restrain the government from taking every possible measure to help to keep us safe. Have you forgotten the lessons of history? On the other side, the critics of the NSA and of what they see as rampant and unrestrained government spying charge that any intrusion into individual privacy is a fundamental infringement of core American values. The NSA, they insist, is a rogue agency that is trampling on core American freedoms. No government agency can be trusted! Have you forgotten the lessons of history?CommentsTEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"What can a pickpocket teach us about the art of getting people\u0027s attention? A lot - if you can keep up with him. Watch expert thief Apollo Robbins in action and see if you can figure out how he does it.Comments (22)Michael RothPresident, Wesleyan UniversityAs president of Wesleyan, and as a historian, I deplore this politically retrograde resolution of the American Studies Assn. Under the guise of phony progressivism, the group has initiated an irresponsible attack on academic freedom. Others in academia should reject this call for an academic boycott.Comments (47)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarCelebrity weight loss stories are called out as destructive and anti-feminist. And yet, there\u0027s something refreshing -- and, perhaps, even healthy -- about those celebrities who publicly discuss their ups and downs.CommentsNoah MichelsonEditor, HuffPost Gay VoicesWhile I love homophobes like Westboro Baptist Church for making my job easy, our real work is uncovering the wicked truth hiding beneath those who claim they love us while they bludgeon us with their Bibles.Comments (347)Ronni ThomasCreator and director, \u0027The Midnight Archive\u0027Why not take a few minutes between window shopping and sucking down Christmas cheer to celebrate the most fascinating, most allusive, most charming historical figure?Comments (31)Brie DyasThis is it, guys. The last weekend before Christmas. Malls are open until midnight. There\u0027s an abnormal surplus of \"safe\" last-minute gifts (read: robes, commemorative ornaments and off-brand bath sets) in the front of every store.And everyone you encounter is pretty much a jerk.CommentsStacie KrajchirAuthor, Founder The See and Sprout ProjectThe reality is, motherhood is, while blissful, downright scary and beyond overwhelming -- especially after 40.Comments (60)Carl SicilianoExecutive Director, Ali Forney CenterI have been talking with homeless kids from all over the country, asking them to help us understand what it means to be left on the streets, asking them to give witness to what they endure. I ask you to look into their traumatized eyes and listen with me to their heartbreaking testimonies.CommentsMichael KeeganPresident, People For the American WayYes, things are getting better. But that\u0027s not saying much. Republicans have lowered the standards of Congress so much that the completion of a basic task like passing a budget or confirming a non-controversial judge is now cause for celebration.CommentsFrances BeineckePresident, Natural Resources Defense CouncilThe United States broke one record after another for extreme weather in 2013. Americans saw what unchecked climate change can do to our communities. But we also witnessed another kind of powerful force: real and positive climate action.CommentsJames ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027This year, as Arab Christians gather to celebrate the birth of Jesus, the promised \"peace on earth, good will to men\" will appear, at best, as a remote dream.CommentsNathaniel FrankAuthor, \u0027Unfriendly Fire: How the Gay Ban Undermines the Military and Weakens America\u0027The state -- at least the state of New Mexico -- does not privilege marriage as a way to make impulsive young men stick by their kids. It sanctions marriage to help strengthen the commitments of couples and families -- real families. And that includes gay ones.CommentsSherman YellenScreenwriter, Playwright, memoirist, and LyricistMy mother knew that her sister Ida would be shocked, more likely horrified by the Christmas tree. It would be another sign of Lilly, \"the American one,\" drifting away from the customs of their forefathers.CommentsJeremy Ben-AmiPresident and Founder, J StreetClearly, we must remain vigilant against the threat of anti-Semitism. But the constant use of the accusation against anyone that we feel is insufficiently pro-Israel (including members of our own community) or against anyone we disagree with is foolish and damaging.Comments (58)Elliott NeginDirector of News \u0026 Commentary, Union of Concerned ScientistsA new study documenting that just 90 companies are responsible for two-thirds of manmade carbon emissions since the Industrial Revolution triggered some pushback in the blogosphere. Blame the likes of BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and Shell for global warming? Not fair!Comments (65)Chris BoeskoolBlogs at theboeskool.com about Jesus, politics, and bathroom humorWhat is noteworthy is the conversation that is going to take place over the next couple of days on social media. I say \"conversation,\" but really it\u0027s mostly going to be a bunch of angry people who are certain that God is on their side typing in ALL CAPS.Comments (136)Rev. Dr. Susan Brooks ThistlethwaiteProfessor of Theology, Chicago Theological SeminarySanta is kind of scary, especially when compared to Jesus. Santa is judgmental. Santa gives bribes for being good, and if you\u0027re not good, Santa doesn\u0027t forgive. He just puts coal in your stocking and moves on. Jesus will forgive you. That\u0027s the whole Gospel right there.Comments (54)Alan ElsnerAuthor, \u0027Gates of Injustice: The Crisis in America’s Prisons\u0027George Santayana famously said that those who cannot learn from history are condemned to repeat it. How true this is right now for the U.S., which after years of combat in Iraq and Afghanistan, now finds itself at a crossroads in its efforts to reach a peaceful, diplomatic solution to the crisis created by Iran\u0027s nuclear program.Comments (28)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027Praises of the pope are flowing around the world, commentary on the pontiff leads all the news shows, and even late night television comedians are paying humorous homage. But a few of the journalists covering the pope are getting it right: Francis is just doing his job. The pope is meant to be a follower of Christ.Comments (40)Russell SimmonsFounder, GlobalGrind.comHistory will judge this president not just for being the first black president, but for being the president that began our nation\u0027s course toward a more progressive union.Comments (38)Diedre A. WareWriter, Avid Reader, World Traveler, and Free SpiritThis man we idolized should have looked more like me. Or, rather, like my father. Because that\u0027s who he had been all along.CommentsBob BurnettBerkeley writer, retired Silicon Valley executiveIf approved by Congress, this pact between the U.S. and 11 or 12 of America\u0027s Pacific Rim trade-partners would govern 40 percent of U.S. imports and exports. So far, the negotiations are being conducted under tight security; for good reason, as there are big problems with TPP.Comments (24)Melissa Burkley, Ph.D.Associate professor of social psychology, Oklahoma State UniversityExternal forces whittle down our choices in unconscious ways; tricking us into thinking we have more free will than we really doComments (16)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorIt\u0027s not over -- they still have to appropriate their new top-line spending numbers down to all the agencies -- but it looks like the budget deal that quite handily cleared both chambers will soon be enacted. But I\u0027ve got a few lingering thoughtsComments (15)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundAs millions of Christians around the world prepare to celebrate Christmas and their belief that God entered human history as a poor tiny baby, let us remember all the poor babies and children who struggle to live and realize their God given potential in our own rich land and all around the world today.Comments (15)Tom EngelhardtEditor, TomDispatch.comYou have to imagine that line in giant letters with a monstrous exclamation point covering most of the bottom third of the front page of theNew York Post. The reference was to a caravan of vehicles on its way to or from a wedding in Yemen that was eviscerated, evidently by a U.S. drone via one of those \"surgical\" strikes of which Washington is so proud.CommentsBecky CavenderFreelance writer, artist, and single momI\u0027m not unaware that some men don\u0027t prefer us fat girls. They don\u0027t have to! It\u0027s not offensive that they don\u0027t. I\u0027m typically not attracted to slender, skinny guys. I doubt those men feel offended and left out.Comments (115)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, Beyond OutrageOur life chances are now determined to an unprecedented degree by the wealth of our parents. That\u0027s not always been the case. The faith that anyone could move from rags to riches -- with enough guts and gumption, hard work and nose to the grindstone -- was once at the core of the American Dream.Comments (481)Andrea MeyerWriterI do still wish, more than anything, that I had two children: Aidan and Nina. But now I know that longing for the daughter I lost does not mean I want a replacement.Comments (16)Winifred M. ReillyLicensed Marriage and Family Therapist and author of the relationship advice blog Speaking of MarriageThis week, we will celebrate our 35th wedding anniversary. Does that mean we discovered the \"secret\"? Hardly. Have we learned something? Definitely! And thank goodness for that.CommentsCatherine McKenzie, 2013.21.12Steve Zack, 2013.21.12Barbara Bruno, 2013.21.12Byron Williams, 2013.21.12Michael Brune, 2013.21.12Bart Mihailovich, 2013.21.12Joe Hutcheson, 2013.21.12Frances Beinecke, 2013.21.12Fern Siegel, 2013.21.12Fred Karger, 2013.21.12Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"SHOCK POLL: AMERICANS DON\u0027T TRUST SCIENTISTS",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BizYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
