{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupUncorked anger doesn’t usually win presidential nominations, let alone presidencies. People want hope and uplift in the White House and not just expressions of outrage. The president is the person who is supposed to make things work. To some, the 44-year-old Cruz gives off a vaguely scary aura of cheerful menace. For now, as Cruz officially announces his 2016 bid, he is nearly an asterisk in the early GOP polls, well behind somewhat less apocalyptic personalities, such as Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. But there are several reasons to take Cruz seriously.Multiculturalism should not mean that we tolerate another culture\u0027s intolerance. If we do in fact support diversity, women\u0027s rights, and gay rights, then we cannot in good conscience give Islam a free pass on that spurious ground.Author, Heretic: Why Islam Needs a Reformation NowOur current political situation is unprecedented. The vast majority of Americans keep falling behind economically because of changes in society\u0027s ground rules, while the rich get even richer -- yet this situation doesn\u0027t translate into a winning politics.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Just as the U.S. wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya fertilized the field for IS, another U.S. war, the so-called War on Drugs, opened new horizons for the drug cartels.Author, \u0027Mainstreaming Torture\u0027Factual information is out of fashion. American society now devalues it. Subjective attitude and opinion are considered to be as worthy as accurate renderings of reality. Many wear their ignorance as a badge of honor.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghUnless the campaign financing system is reformed, the U.S. Congress will become paid employees of the people who pay for their campaigns -- the billionaire class. Needless to say, not everyone on the Committee agreed.Independent U.S. Senator from VermontProstitution as portrayed in Pretty Woman is just about as far as you can get from the truth. Prostitution is ugly. Most of it is sex trafficking. It\u0027s intriguing to read that the movie\u0027s script originally was written as a dark, cautionary tale. That, from my perspective as a survivor, gets at the sad reality.Project manager for women’s justice programs and human-trafficking coordinator, Cook County Sheriff’s OfficeWhy would she now call further attention to her lies and obfuscations of the truth nearly six years after she abandoned her governorship? Because it pays for her to do so.Author and filmmakerWhen does normal adolescence angst become a compulsive need for affirmation? And when does that angst turn into pathological narcissism? For starters, we might look at the devices in our hands.Psychologist and author, \u0027Face It\u0027It seems clear that Texas cannot constitutionally forbid the display of the Confederate flag on a license plate because others might find it \"offensive or disagreeable.\" But it is not so simple. Is the government discriminating among private speakers, or is it expressing only the messages it wishes to convey?Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoI heard someone say that you have two lives; you start living the second one when you realize you only have one. And that\u0027s what I\u0027ve been doing the past 1,000 days. Life is for living, and I can\u0027t do that if I am not present for it, and I can\u0027t be present for it if I\u0027m not sober.Blogger, www.itsalushlife.comYou would be amazed at how many simple \"facts\" a family has passed down through stories repeated at the dinner table and family gatherings turn out not to be exact in their details, having become elaborated on over time, like a game of \"Telephone\" that we all played as children.Alphonse Fletcher University Professor and Director of the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research at Harvard UniversityEditor, writer, and teacherAmerica clings to the conceit that four years of college are necessary for everyone, and looks down its nose at people who don\u0027t have college degrees. This has to stop. It\u0027s time to give up the idea that every young person has to go to college, and start offering high-school seniors an alternative route into the middle class.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027When our daughter first came home to us, weeks before her \"sweet 16\" birthday, she had one pair of shoes. A pair of old, dirty, split-down-the-sides tennis shoes.Foster Children\u0027s Rights Coalition - FosteringRights.orgIran\u0027s deplorable record is not a reason to walk away. It is the very reason we must hammer out a iron-clad agreement to ensure Iran cannot get it\u0027s hands on a nuclear bomb.President, Ploughshares Fund; Author, \u0027Nuclear Nightmares: Securing the World Before It Is Too Late\u0027We must make this country a nation of equal protection under the law with equal opportunity for everyone. If we truly would like to be post-racial one day, we cannot continue to live in denial, or turn a blind eye towards reality, or remain complacent today. It\u0027s as simple as that.President, National Action NetworkISIS has been operating from the pedophile\u0027s playbook.Professor of Security Studies, University of Massachusetts, Lowell; research fellow, Center for Terrorism and Security StudiesAs I begin to rethink and review the Obama presidency, I think history will judge it based principally not on Obamacare but on two other matters: his foreign policy and the consequences of his presidency on the unfinished business of race relations in America.Diversity Visiting Professor, University of San Francisco; and Scholar Writer in Residence, MLK, Jr. Institute, Stanford UniversityEmanuel and Cuomo are \"progr-actionaries.\" They\u0027re reliably left on social issues and reliably right on economic issues like tax policy, unions, and corporate giveaways.Senior Fellow, DemosForests benefit the world, and each of us, every day in countless ways that are all too easy to overlook. On this year\u0027s International Day of Forests, let\u0027s make a promise to do more to ensure healthy, productive forests for future generations.President and CEO, Sustainable Forestry Initiative Inc.Legislators in a number of states, including Oklahoma and Tennessee, have introduced bills that would require insurers to cover proton therapy if a patient\u0027s doctor believes it is the most appropriate form of radiation.Author, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgCritical thinking is NOT starting with the conclusion that you want to reach and then constructing a bridge of arguments specifically designed to get you there, and yet this is perilously close to the kind of thinking a standardized test requires.Teacher and writer; blogger, curmudgucation.blogspot.comWordsmith, photo nerd, sitcom junkie, dog lover, and Editor at 500px. Everything I ever needed to know I learned from Calvin and Hobbes.Lee Kuan Yew died on Monday at the age of 91. And with his demise, modern Asia has lost all of its postwar political wizards, men and women who carved entire countries from the clangor of colonial rule or from disputes with neighbors. This year, his beloved Singapore will mark its 50th anniversary of independence.Bestselling author, historian, biographer, foreign correspondentA select few are proving you don\u0027t need to serve 6-ton burritos to achieve fast-casual stardom.Everything worth caring about in food, drink, and travelWhen Ann Sothern was asked during the filming of The Whales of August, in 1986, how she compared her career to that of her two iconic costars, Lillian Gish and Bette Davis, she said, \"Well, they are the queens and I suppose I\u0027m a movie princess.\"Producer; Documentary director; Actor; Award-winning poster designerA thousand political obituaries would be written; a hundred stunned DC pundits would be asking themselves how this could have possibly happened. And in all this conversation, a major underlying narrative would be about the rising progressive tide shaking up Democratic politics.Co-Founder, Democracy PartnersMy family does not look like me. We don\u0027t share the same DNA. But our family ties are real and our economic stability is interdependent. We must make sure the rights of each person and their families are equally protected.Activist, writer, freelance strategist and trainer for social justice causesWhen the House released its budget last Tuesday, Georgia Republican Rep. Rob Woodall said, \"A budget is a moral document; it talks about where your values are.\" His chamber\u0027s spending plan shows that Republicans highly value war and place no value on health care for America\u0027s elderly, working poor and young adults.International President, United SteelworkersAs humanitarian needs persist and even grow in Syria and neighboring countries, the rest of the world must not forget about the crisis. This is a time to be bold. This is not a time for inaction. This is not a time to watch a country be destroyed and generations of Syrians scattered and forgotten.Founder \u0026 Writer, Foreign Loren + Emergency Response \u0026 Development WorkerNo surprise that almost four months into the Republican takeover of Congress, more time has been spent on immigration -- specifically, trying to reverse President Obama\u0027s executive actions shielding 5 million immigrants from deportation -- than almost anything else.Univision America Host \u0026 contributor to NPR, The Hill, FoxNews Latino and other mediaGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"WH: ISRAELI OCCUPATION \u0027MUST END\u0027",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
