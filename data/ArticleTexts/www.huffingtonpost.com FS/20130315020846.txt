{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jim WallisChristian leader for social changeI fervently hope and pray that a Global South pope who deliberately chooses his name from Francis of Assisi will be that agent of change. In the 12th century, the young Francis of Assisi heard a call that became his mission -- \"rebuild my Church\" -- straight from the voice of God. And today, the church needs rebuilding again -- to be what the church was meant to be. But to make those changes, Pope Francis will need to address some very fundamental issues. While these are enormous challenges for Pope Francis, the grace of God is sufficient for faithful church leaders to lead. And Jorge Bergoglio is said to be such a man of God -- fervent in personal faith and consistent prayer. So let us all do what the first thing the new Pope Francis asked the people in the square to do: to pray for him.Comments (233)Bob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowIt\u0027s always a good idea to keep a tenacious eye on government authority. But if we, as citizens and activists, want to be taken as grown-ups, it seems to me as if we need to pick our battles wisely.Comments (204)Gianni Del VecchioEditor in Chief, Huffington Post ItalyThe Cardinals understood that they needed a pope who is close to the less fortunate, and far from the ostentation and intrigue of the palazzo. And that\u0027s who they\u0027ve chosen.Comments (100)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The biggest problems we face are unemployment, stagnant wages, slow growth, and widening inequality -- not deficits. The major goal must be to get jobs and wages back, not balance the budget.Comments (959)Danielle HarkPhotographer, Founder of BrokenLightCollective.comWhether you suffer from depression or are just having a case of the winter blues, there are things you can do right now to help brighten your day.

We need to transform the way we all engage with fragile and conflict-affected states. So what does it take?CommentsTony SchwartzPresident of The Energy Project; Author of Be Excellent at Anything: The Four Keys to Transforming the Way We Work and LiveFor more than a decade now, I\u0027ve struggled to define what fuels the most sustainably productive work environment. Perhaps nothing I\u0027ve uncovered is as important as trust.Comments (11)Josh KlenertHead of UX and Design, The Huffington PostCommentsHarville Hendrix and Helen LaKelly HuntThe idea of having to spend time focused on our most important relationship may seem strange - even depressing. But it\u0027s worth it! And while creating the relationship of your dreams will take effort, it doesn\u0027t have to be a grueling experience full of suffering.Comments (30)Margaret Wheeler JohnsonWomen\u0027s EditorIt\u0027s a harrowing and liberating moment when you realize you\u0027ve let fear determine the perimeters of your life, and that you are ready to redraw the lines.Comments (30)ZooBornsMore than just a furry face.

But that skepticism of centralized power and state-led social engineering apparently do not apply beyond America\u0027s borders.CommentsJeff DanzigerPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideComments (13)Amy Julia BeckerAuthor, \u0027A Good and Perfect Gift: Faith, Expectations and a Little Girl Named Penny\u0027To think that a child\u0027s life can be summarized by the balance of her flaws and her achievements, with a scorecard at the end that deems her either a burden to our family or a productive citizen within our society, betrays my role as her mother altogether.Comments (24)Barbara BrunoNFL Analyst and Commentator, Independent Film Producer, Non-Profit Grant WriterReggie Dunn is one of those fortunate people who has an exceptional gift, understands it and has embraced the mission to ride that gift to a dream.CommentsZiad J. Asali, M.D.President, American Task Force on PalestineThe real battle in the Middle East is between those who wish to see the region in general, and the Arab world in particular, modernize along the lines of universal values, and those who would impose their own versions of intolerance and authoritarianism. Which is to say: Values and ideas matter.CommentsArianna HuffingtonIt\u0027s become accepted wisdom that Washington has become pathologically polarized and partisan, with every new debate inevitably breaking down along party lines. That\u0027s why it was so remarkable last week when Rand Paul\u0027s old-fashioned talking filibuster scrambled the even more old-fashioned right-vs.-left way of looking at the world.Comments (513)Alex ZakarasAssociate Professor of Political Science, University of VermontThe budget just released by House Republicans marks the culmination of an important, long-term shift in the Republican Party. Over the last several decades, the party has abandoned political conservatism and embraced its opposite: an agenda of radical, experimental reform.Comments (119)Mark R. KennedyProfessor of political management and director of the Graduate School of Political Management, George Washington UniversityMuch has been said about Pope Francis being the first papal selection from the New World or the first to be selected from the ranks of the Jesuits, but most amazing to me is that he is the first to select the name of Francis.Comments (11)Lincoln MitchellHarriman Institute, Columbia UniversityRyan\u0027s newest budget is much more about communicating with his party\u0027s leadership and activists than about usefully contributing to the policy debate. It could perhaps most accurately be described as the \"make Paul Ryan relevant again budget.\"Comments (30)Jamal AbdiPolicy Director, National Iranian American CouncilThe resolution, S.Res.65, is rightly being called a backdoor to war with Iran -- a convenient way to plunge the U.S. into war without a messy public debate but instead automatically, based on when Israel Prime Minister Netanyahu decides to pull the trigger.Comments (20)Peter DiamandisChairman/CEO, X PRIZE FoundationI spoke with founder Jack Hughes, who filled me in on TopCoder\u0027s humble beginnings at a picnic table, and the way the company approaches its innovative contest-driven, gamified, crowdsourcing solutions.CommentsRana FloridaCEO, The Creative Class Group \u0026 Author, UpgradeWhether entertaining a small group of friends at home or planning a major event, these simple style, design and culinary insights offer just what you need to make any occasion that much more special.CommentsJamie CourtAuthor, \u0027The Progressive\u0027s Guide to Raising Hell\u0027; President, Consumer WatchdogGoogle Glass opens a Pandora\u0027s box for society that will forever change it unless the public gets the right to hit delete and turn on its \"Do Not Track Me\" option.Comments (16)Michael MooreOscar and Emmy-winning directorSomeday a Sandy Hook mother - or a Columbine mother, or an Aurora mother, or a mother from massacres yet to come - will say, like the mother of Emmett Till, \"I just want the world to see.\" And then nothing about guns in this country will ever be the same again.Comments (2,667)Shawn AhmedCreator of The Uncultured ProjectToday was probably the first -- and last -- time someone who is both Muslim and gay will be the one to bring Catholic priests news of a new Pope.Comments (113)Pamela DruckermanAuthor, \u0027Bringing Up Bébé\u0027 and \u0027Bébé Day By Day\u0027When it comes to parental authority, we Americans could take some more lessons from the French.

Pope Francis, it seems, will bring some positive change to the Church, but will leave the core problems in place.Comments (55)Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H.
