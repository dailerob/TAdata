{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Former TIME Middle East correspondent, Professor at American University in CairoFriday\u0027s announcement of George Mitchell\u0027s planned resignation as the U.S. mediator in the Arab-Israeli conflict appears to be yet another sign of the disarray and failure in President Obama\u0027s handling of the Middle East. So here\u0027s some free advice for the president: Change is messy, but the Middle East isn\u0027t as complicated as you have been led to think. In your upcoming speech and future actions, support the quest of 350 million Arabs for democracy. Stop hesitating and the next time you come to Tahrir Square, you\u0027ll fill the place.Read Post | CommentsDoug Kendall, 05.13.2011Founder and President, Constitutional Accountability CenterIt is undoubtedly the case that all our kids could use a good civics lesson, but the modern day James Madisons from the Tea Party who are vying for access to our schools are peddling ideological snake oil, not real history.Read Post | CommentsElena Lacayo, 05.13.2011Immigration Legislative and Field Associate, National Council of La RazaTwenty-four states have already rejected the irresponsible approach to immigration reform pioneered by Arizona\u0027s SB 1070. Georgia and Utah should heed the warning that nothing good will result from copycat legislation.Read Post | CommentsMarian Wright Edelman, 05.13.2011President, Children\u0027s Defense FundWhile the Voting Rights Act and other federal voting laws prohibit discrimination based on race, sex, language, ethnicity, religion and age, there is still no law that affirmatively guarantees citizens the right to vote.Read Post | CommentsLaurie David, 05.13.2011Producer/Author/NRDC TrusteeWhen BPA was first introduced in the late 1950s, maybe we didn\u0027t question the chemicals use in products that we ingest and touch, including the everyday cashier\u0027s receipt. But what is the excuse today, fifty years later?Read Post | CommentsDaphne Eviatar, 05.13.2011Senior Associate, Human Rights First’s Law and Security ProgramTwelve-year-old Nelofar was shot dead early Thursday morning outside her family\u0027s home in Eastern Afghanistan because NATO troops mistakenly believed that her uncle was a Taliban leader.Read Post | CommentsDavid Callahan, 05.13.2011Senior Fellow, DemosThough repealing tax breaks for oil companies is a great idea, it\u0027s not enough. What\u0027s needed is comprehensive corporate tax reform to close the loopholes exploited by a wide range of U.S. firms -- not just those in the petroleum industry.Read Post | CommentsSusan McCue and Dana Perino, 05.13.2011Social media have helped drive the historic change we have witnessed across the Middle East. In less visible areas of the world, like the Congo, where rape is being used as a tactic of war, they can do the same.Read Post | CommentsRev. Al Sharpton, 05.13.2011President, National Action NetworkOnce again trying to paint a picture that the president is some sort of angry Black man who has a vested interest in taking this nation down, the right is implying that Obama is somehow not one of us.Read Post | CommentsBrendan Nyhan, 05.13.2011Political scientist and media criticIt is possible to convince people who aren\u0027t hardcore believers and conspiracy theorists. However, these conditions rarely materialize for prominent political misperceptions, which tend to be harder to definitively debunk.Read Post | CommentsMaria Cooper Janis, 05.13.2011ArtistThe world of today, saturated with fears of international terrorism, global ecological crises, and a glut of hardwired broadband information networks that weave connections across the entire planet is a far cry from the world that Gary Cooper left when he died on May 13th 1961.Read Post | CommentsBill Allen, 05.13.2011Retired Editor-in-Chief of \"National Geographic\"For those who thought Texas holds a comfortable lead in dumbest assaults on education, the news that a California school board will mandate political influence into science topics will be worrisome.Read Post | CommentsT. Colin Campbell, Ph.D. and Caldwell B. Esselstyn, Jr., MD, 05.13.2011For more than 2,800 years, the concept of eating plants in their whole-food form has struggled to be adopted as a way of life. However, recent evidence shows that a plant-based diet is not something to be ignored.Read Post | CommentsDoug Bandow, 05.13.2011Senior Fellow at the Cato InstituteJustice was served by bin Laden\u0027s death. But the Bush administration policy of torture deserves no credit. Never again should Washington, like Esau, sacrifice America\u0027s fundamental values for a mess of pottage.Read Post | CommentsMarty Kaplan, 05.13.2011Director, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolWhether cable stations run a countdown clock for when we\u0027ll hit the national debt limit or not, the controversy draws viewers, so the networks win either way. I just wish that were also true for the country.Read Post | CommentsMichael B. Keegan, 05.13.2011President, People For the American WayIf self-promotion were the top trait Americans were looking for in a president, Newt Gingrich would be a shoe-in. But the job requires a bit more than that.Read Post | CommentsDorian de Wind, 05.13.2011Ret. U.S. Air Force MajorWhile a five-year sentence may sound excessive for a 91-year-old man, I cannot ignore nor forget the fact that, because of monsters like John Demjanjuk, some of my surname never had the chance to even reach the age of nine.Read Post | CommentsRyan Phillips, 05.13.2011Founder, Rumors and RantsBack in 2006 we all knew Tiger Woods was eventually going to race past Jack Nicklaus\u0027 record of 18 major championships and set a new standard which would likely never be broken. It was a fact of life. Fast forward to 2011, and it is looking like a long-shot at best.Read Post | CommentsScott Bittle, 05.13.2011Executive vice president and editor, PublicAgenda.orgPart of leadership is conveying an air of optimism and confidence. But what does it mean when leaders are more optimistic than the people they\u0027re supposed to be leading?Read Post | CommentsEve Ensler, 05.12.2011Author of \u0027I Am An Emotional Creature\" and \"The Vagina Monologues,\" Founder of V-DayI Am Over: A world that could allow, has allowed, continues to allow 400 thousand women, 23,00 women, or one woman to be raped anywhere, anytime of any day in the Congo.Read Post | CommentsJill Morris, 05.13.2011Lobster in Glasses, Onion Contributor, Witstream Aristocrat, Author of \"Please Fire Me\"Are lobsters funny? To a lobster comedian such as myself, the question itself seems like a joke. While we can all agree that man dominates the field of comedy, it can no longer be argued that lobsters are, by nature, not hilarious. But what can we do to get more lobsters out of their shells and into comedy?Read Post | CommentsMichael Shaw, 05.13.2011Publisher of the visual politics and photojournalism site, BagNewsNotesWhat we\u0027re sadly lacking from Fukushima is a bigger and much better picture of what is a still-boiling disaster.Read Post | CommentsMatthew Dowd, 05.12.2011Political StrategistBin Laden\u0027s death doesn\u0027t signify the checkered flag but rather a lifting of the yellow flag of caution that allows us to regain our footing and pick up the pace. Our opponent is not terrorism but the divisions between us.Read Post | CommentsMatthew Edlund, M.D., 05.13.2011Director, Center for Circadian Medicine; author, \u0027The Power of Rest\u0027Be careful when you read headlines about new miracle cures and the wondrous effects of supplements.
