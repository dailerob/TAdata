{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"As a lifelong lover of the arts, and having written books on two of the greatest artists of the 20th century -- Pablo Picasso and Maria Callas -- I have from the beginning looked forward to having a HuffPost section devoted to covering music, painting, sculpture, film, photography, drama, dance, etc. So I am delighted to announce the launch of HuffPost Arts. Like all of our sections, HuffPost Arts will bring you the latest news -- in this case on all things artistic and cultural. It will also be home to a freewheeling group blog in which artists, critics, curators, and those who love the arts will sound off. And we look forward to having your active involvement with the section, sending tips, posting comments, voting on slideshows, and contributing your own stories and images. So check out HuffPost Arts. And let us know what you think.Read Post | CommentsBob Cesca, 06.16.2010Author, Blogger, New Media ProducerOnce we\u0027re exhausted with blaming and yelling, we climb into our oversized cars, crank up the air conditioner, drive to Burger King and order an ammonia-washed beef sandwich the size of a baby -- while mindlessly idling at the drive-thru.Read Post | CommentsRobert Reich, 06.16.2010Former Secretary of Labor, Professor at BerkeleyThe man who electrified the nation with his speech at the Democratic National Convention of 2004 put it to sleep Tuesday night.
