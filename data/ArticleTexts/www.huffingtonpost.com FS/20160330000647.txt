{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-Founder, Democracy PartnersThe political version of the Unifying Theory of Everything is that the elites don’t get it. Real voters -- the ones out in America’s heartland who rarely get raises, who are stressed and financially pressed by trying to figure out how to support their families and pay for their kids’ college tuition and save a little bit for their retirement -- are tired of political BS, and tired of the people at the top getting all the breaks while they get none. For many of those folks, the breaking point came when Wall Street wrecked the economy through all kinds of reckless and fraudulent financial speculation, and not only got to keep from going to jail or getting fired, but actually got record bonuses just months after taxpayers bailed them out. When that happened, Democratic, Republican, and Independent voters alike got incredibly cynical about American politics.Amidst the comprehensive moral and intellectual collapse of the GOP, nothing captures its utter bankruptcy more than the issue of gun violence. Lest this seem too stark, we must consider its stunning record of rhetorical and legislative obedience to the NRA.Novelist and contributing opinion writerEducation is in crisis because of the calculated effort to turn it into a business with a bottom line. Schools are closed and opened as though they were chain stores, not community institutions. Teachers are fired based on flawed measures. Disruption is considered a strategy rather than misguided and inhumane policy.Research Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027When you press Democrats on their uninspiring deeds -- their lousy free trade deals, for example -- they reply that this is the best anyone could have done. But let\u0027s choose a locale where Democratic rule is virtually unopposed, a place where Republican obstruction and sabotage can\u0027t taint this experiment.Harper\u0027s columnist; Author, \u0027Pity the Billionaire\u0027At the fourth nuclear security summit this week, world leaders will discuss how to prevent ISIS and other terrorists from getting their hands on the ingredients of nuclear terror. And Belgium\u0027s prime minister might be the leader with the most to say. Since the 2014 summit, Belgium has suffered a number of suspicious and alarming activities at its nuclear sites. Fortunately, Belgium has shown that there are clear actions that can drastically reduce the risk.Professor, Harvard University; Co-Principal Investigator, Project on Managing the AtomAs our kids grow older and at each stage of life, my husband and I will continue to reevaluate technology use and ultimately make the decisions that we believe are best suited to the developing needs of our children and family.Entrepreneur, educator, author and partner at Tangelo, an innovation lab.Saying that the Qur\u0027an is the real culprit of Belgian terror attacks would be the same as saying that the Bible is the real culprit behind the Spanish Inquisition. Both of these statements are false.Lawyer, writer, and self proclaimed Mortal Kombat ChampionTeacher diversity is an educational civil right for our students. The research is clear that a diverse teaching force is essential to ensuring high-quality education for all students, and especially for students of color.President, American Federation of TeachersFor refugees facing imminent risks or health crises, the delays and backlogs that plague the already slow U.S. resettlement process can lead to tragedy.Nonprofit, Nonpartisan International Human Rights OrganizationIf transgender people cannot safely pee in public, we cannot safely exist in public.Trans* and GenderQueer-identified psychotherapist in the NYC area working with sexual/gender minority populations. www.LauraAJacobs.comOur government shouldn\u0027t give a religious organization millions of dollars if it refused to provide access to reproductive health care, especially when it promised it wouldn\u0027t do so. Alas, the government has broken its promise, and that broken promise could harm trafficking victims.Senior Staff Attorney, ACLU\u0027s Reproductive Freedom ProjectThe fossil fuel industry\u0027s denial apparatus is in an anxious state that it may be exposed, but sunlight into the vile machine cannot come too soon.Democratic Senator from Rhode IslandBritain has now joined Mexico and France in taxing businesses when they compromise the health of our children. I don\u0027t believe it\u0027s anti-business. In the UK, kids and teenagers\u0027 single largest source of sugar is from sugary sweetened drinks and with one-third of kids overweight or obese, these statistics cannot be taken lightly anymore. Of course, industry totally disagree - what they all agree on is personal responsibility and self-regulation, and look where that got us. The announcement of a sugary drinks tax has sent ripples around the world, especially in countries where they\u0027re also struggling with childhood obesity.Celebrity Chef and Food ActivistWhile Trump wants to put large tariffs on imports from some of our major trading partners, President Obama is actively pushing to have far larger tariffs imposed on a wide range of goods in his trade deals, most importantly the Trans-Pacific Partnership.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Jails and prisons have a unique opportunity to serve people in need of treatment and divert them from harmful behaviors. But right now, almost every step they take reinforces an incarcerated person\u0027s reasons for using substances. A drug-related jail or prison term shouldn\u0027t carry a death risk.The full spectrum of human relationships with drugsDemocratic populism seems to be growing. If Sanders falls short this time around, the next time a populist runs, they may actually succeed. Bernie has already gone a long way towards transforming the Democratic Party into a much more people-centered party.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comForfeiting journalistic and social morality, news outlets have turned their frantic coverage of Donald Trump\u0027s presidential campaign into a poisonous fetish, and contributed to the progress of the most distasteful kind of clickbait -- Trump\u0027s narratives of white supremacy.Award-winning freelance journalist, educator, and writer at www.blackandwordy.comIt\u0027s great that you\u0027re willing to learn, but the only way to do that is to start learning from us: the underprivileged trans women of color who face the brunt of institutionalized transphobia.Trans Rights Advocate, Musician, Volunteer Coordinator for STRIVE, Social Media Coordinator for the Florida Transgender Alliance, Vlogger, Nerd, Artist, Proud Feminist SlutThere was no reason to start yet another round of the holy war, ramping up the propaganda, getting Congress all excited, foisting false choices on people while casting aspersions on the tech industry in general and Apple in particular. But as we’ve seen over the years, this is the FBI’s MO.Communications consultantThe unwillingness of Trump and Cruz to condemn and move the country away from its past endorsement of torture is yet one more reason why they lack the national security qualifications or understanding to guide this country\u0027s military and foreign policies.Truman National Security Project partner, veteran/military families consultant and Navy reservist. All opinions are his own.Whether there are 8 or 800 -- with bright double-ball elastic holders tight at the top and butterfly barrettes bouncing at the bottom or with cobalt blue yarn woven throughout -- braids are, and always will be, a definitive symbol of black girl culture.Image activist, writer and creator of MAD FREEUnderstanding that what\u0027s happening now is no more or less than what was readily predictable a year ago is crucial to understanding the current state of the Democratic primary race. This means unpacking not just the Clinton camp\u0027s transparent attempts to skew the media narrative, but also, and more importantly, the hard data behind a comeback that could end up being every bit as historic as Sanders supporters are now suggesting it will be.Assistant Professor of English at University of New Hampshire; Series Co-Editor, Best American Experimental WritingMany believe that this is simply a law that is made to make sure that people are using the restrooms and facilities related to their biological sex. It is much more than that. One of the things that a lot of people fail to realize is some of the actual underwriting of the bill itself.Music producer and musicianRumor has it that President Obama is soon scheduled to travel to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. I only wish I could adequately relay the disgust I have in my heart when I anticipate having to see my president smiling, laughing, and joking with his \"special Saudi friends\" -- the very same people who I believe underwrote the murder of my husband and nearly 3,000 others.9/11 widow and activistIf you do feel the need to persuade me that the testing ritual is excellent and worthwhile, you should know that I have heard most of your arguments, and, frankly, you need new ones.Director of Secondary Education and Secondary Special Education Teacher Preparation, Seton Hall UniversityTwo-thirds of all Civil War mortality, perhaps even higher on the rebel side, were not from battlefield injuries, but from contagious diseases which spread like veritable wildfire among stationery troops.Mike the Gun GuyMany health profession schools convey a \"make or break\" culture which causes many students to fear failure and crumble under the pressure because they wait too long to ask for help.University President, Clinical Psychologist, AuthorFor \u0027Fixer Upper\u0027: Drink if/when Jo says shiplap. Okay, this one may get you sick drunk. Keep a throw up bucket nearby... Jo really likes shiplap. Drink twice if they make a joke about shiplap or Jo\u0027s obsession with the white wood. Or, if Chip makes a joke about something sexual or his height.Fiction writer, blogger at Suburban Shit Show, staff writer at Club Mid and mom to four kids.For years before I began my medical transition, I was discriminated against in the restroom. Before I even knew that transitioning was a possibility, my gender was questioned in the restroom. These experiences are part of my life experience. These experiences traumatized and shaped me.Revolutionary trans* activist, organizer, and educatorEarlier this month, two high-profile men in the tennis world tried to set back women players a few decades. In any context, their misogynist comments are offensive. But they are particularly troublesome because tennis is a sport which has been uniquely progressive on gender equality.Blogs Editor, Huffington PostOn March 24, 2016, Garry Shandling died suddenly of a heart attack. The day of his passing, not many television news feeds had mentioned anything substantial about this comic legend. Unfortunately, other world news had overshadowed the death of a true comic genius.Freelance writer and actor and all around great guyGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
