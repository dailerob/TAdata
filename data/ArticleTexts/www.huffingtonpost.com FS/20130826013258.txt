{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThe big news this week was something that didn\u0027t happen. A heavily armed gunman entered a Georgia elementary school, fired several shots and took some front-office employees hostage, including school bookkeeper Antoinette Tuff. In an extraordinary act of heroism, she talked the gunman into giving himself up. How? With empathy. Along with proving that guns can be stopped by something other than more guns, the story demonstrated the value of highlighting things that are working. What if the entire media focused 24/7 on the power of empathy and what went right in that Georgia school, just as they would have if they\u0027d gone horribly wrong? What the media chooses to feature influences our culture and our national conversation. It\u0027s one reason why HuffPost has launched Impact, Good News and What Is Working sections -- putting the spotlight on extraordinary \"ordinary people\" and unsung heroes like Antoinette Tuff.Comments (134)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundAs the nation celebrates the fiftieth anniversary of the March on Washington, many are discussing what Dr. King would say to the nation and world today and tell us to do. But his message to us today is as clear as it was fifty years ago if only we could hear, heed, and follow his warnings about what we need to do to make America America.Comments (464)Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOThe real question today for long-term investors has less to do with the quasi-inevitably of short-term volatility that comes from expectation of monetary policy shifts in the U.S., and more with whether these short-term bad technicals will contaminate longer-term economic fundamentals.Comments (54)Arianna HuffingtonSince launching our Third Metric campaign -- to redefine success beyond money and power to include well-being, wisdom, our ability to wonder and to give back -- I\u0027ve been seeing things through a Third Metric lens. And what I see is a split-screen world.Comments (655)Mark Ruffalo and Wenonah HauterWhile the broad narrative of President Obama\u0027s speech on climate change in June was something to rally around, his support for fracking threatens to exacerbate climate change to the point of no return, while poisoning our water, air and families in the process. Here\u0027s what we need to do.Comments (374)Lisa BelkinSenior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, The Huffington PostShe talked to him the way you talk to a child. She talked to him the way you talk to YOUR child. She saw him as a human being, not a monster, and she tried to help him.Comments (576)Will BunchAuthor, \u0027Tear Down This Myth\u0027While no one can reasonably claim that this Oklahoma tragedy has been ignored, there\u0027s one aspect of the killing that jumps off the page, and yet -- but for a couple of isolated exceptions -- has been all but banned as a topic for discussion.Comments (1,527)Eleanor LongdenResearch psychologistOver the years, my voices have changed, multiplied, terrorized, inspired, and encouraged. Today they are an intrinsic, valued part of my identity, but there was also a time when their presence drove me to delirious extremes of misery, desperation, and despairComments (433)Eric H. Holder, Jr.Attorney General of the United StatesAs we gather today, 50 years later, their march -- now our march -- goes on. And our focus has broadened to include the cause of women, of Latinos, of Asian Americans, of lesbians, of gays, of people with disabilities and of countless others across this country who still yearn for equality.Comments (238)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarBy allowing Vogue to play up her assets in such an undeniably -- and distractingly -- physical way, Marissa Mayer lost the opportunity to make the case for herself, and for other women, that she is far more than a pretty woman in a blue dress.Comments (186)Doug BandowSenior Fellow, the Cato InstituteInstead of acting as the regime\u0027s enabler, the Obama administration should \"reset\" relations with Cairo. The U.S. should cut off all aid and withdraw America\u0027s ambassador. If Washington has any influence to exercise, it should do so quietly and informallyComments (158)Diane RavitchHistorian, NYU professorCharles Blow is one of the columnists in the New York Times that I usually count on to challenge the conventional wisdom and to speak up for the powerless. Sadly, in his latest column, he parrots the conventional wisdom and voices the opinions of the elites.Comments (412)Mike RyanSenior Entertainment Writer, The Huffington PostBen Affleck is a good choice for Batman. Though, with Affleck\u0027s recent critical success -- culminating in an Oscar win for Argo -- I\u0027m not sure Batman is a good choice for Ben Affleck.Comments (176)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistAs the child of a performer who was always on the go, I grew up on the road. My family would travel with my father from city to city, always staying in the best room of the hotel because he was the star performer. I was eight years old before I realized that every hotel room didn\u0027t come with a piano!Comments (60)Wendell PotterAuthor, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgFolks in Florida are facing having to pay far more for health insurance over the next two years than necessary. And health insurance executives will be laughing all the way to the bank.Comments (1,426)Matt WalshBlogger, talk radio host, father of twinsSome folks seem to get into a customer service Battle Royale every time they step outside their house. Maybe it\u0027s because the universe is against you guys. Or maybe -- just maybe -- it\u0027s because you behave like selfish obnoxious bullies.Comments (4,216)Martha BurkMoney Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsLet\u0027s hope that the 50th anniversary celebration of one of the world\u0027s most important peaceful revolutions includes its daughters equally with its sons.Comments (11)Andy BellattiRegistered dietitian; Creator of Small BitesWhile these healthful groups of people may appear to have widely different diets, there is one common thread: Their intake of processed foods, added sugars, trans fats, and artificial ingredients is minimal, if at all existent.Comments (128)Paul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostThe anniversary of the March on Washington comes at a time when it is hard to feel that the universe is continuing to bend towards justice -- especially for African Americans.Comments (480)Brittany GibbonsBlogger, \"Brittany, Herself\"The fact is, I am horrible at intimacy. I come from a family of non-huggers and I sometimes hate my body, so yeah, recipe for Temple Grandin hug machine. My husband is gorgeous and very, very sexy, but the issues we were having in the sack were all me.Comments (1,626)Pastor Rick HendersonPastor, blogger and grace addictWhen I was a kid I could tell the difference between the kids who wanted to be my friend from the kids who were my friends so that they could play with my toys. Joel and Joyce are the latter. They preach a twisted form of Christianity that teaches obedience, giving and faith as a way to get things from God.Comments (3,038)Tess MunsterPlus size model, make up artist, blogger, activistModeling, and especially living your life in the public eye, is by far the hardest thing I\u0027ve ever done. We are breeding a generation of young girls and guys who think their worth is based on their looks and how many \"likes\" they get. You can say \"It\u0027s always been this way,\" but I can tell you, it hasn\u0027t.Comments (96)Bob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowEvery publication makes mistakes. Every major publication has, at some point, botched a story. But the way things are going with The Guardian as it publishes this series of Edward Snowden \"bombshells,\" we\u0027re well beyond isolated glitches.Comments (746)Ken ReedSports Policy Director, League of FansSitting around an outside table at a restaurant near our home, we were sharing news our youngest child didn\u0027t want to hear: Mom and Dad were not going to let her play soccer anymore.Comments (462)Keli GoffAuthor and Special Correspondent, TheRoot.comI\u0027ve been hard pressed to identify mainstream news outlets that qualify as bastions of true liberalism, actively devoted to advancing basic liberal principles such as racial and economic equality. I was reminded of this upon reading a recent column by Andrew Ross Sorkin.Comments (114)Bill GeorgeProfessor of Management Practice, Harvard Business SchoolTo his credit, Ballmer invested heavily in R\u0026D, but Microsoft has little to show for it. Like many of its high tech counterparts, Microsoft has been unable to overcome the dominance of its core business.Comments (19)Ayaan Hirsi AliFounder, AHA FoundationIn Cairo, Egyptian history appears to have completed a bloody full circle. First the crowds filled Tahrir Square to demand the end of a military-backed dictatorship. Then, just two years later, the crowds filled Tahrir Square again to demand the restoration of a military-backed dictatorship.Comments (359)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkAs a new generation that grew up in the aftermath of the \u002760s movement, we\u0027ve worked diligently to make Dr. King\u0027s dream a reality. But when jobs and justice are still key issues plaguing society today, we have no choice but to call on everyone to gather once again.Comments (186)Lorraine Devon WilkeWriter of Sass \u0026 SensibilityMaybe, if society turns against this bilious, brain-battering behavior, we\u0027ll ever-so-slowly advance to a less hate-filled, poop-throwing cultural community. Despite that distant, negative holler -- \"Nah, that\u0027ll never happen\" -- I maintain it would be delightful if it did.Comments (717)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorDear Prime Minister Stephen Harper: I read with interest that you are considering allowing Verizon Communications to operate Canada with unique acquisition rights. Bad idea. Why would you allow one of our country\u0027s most aggressive tax dodgers, a company with a track record of overtly ripping off our government, into your country?Comments (108)Abby WambachTwo-time Olympic gold medalist, 2012 FIFA World Player of the YearI was a teenager... and I idolized the US Women\u0027s National Team. They were amazing players and people who were living a life that was hard to comprehend. Fortunately, I was also beginning to play on youth national teams and I slowly started to envision myself in their shoes.Comments (41)Alice Gatebuke, 2013.25.08David Brake, 2013.25.08Peter Dreier, 2013.25.08Jeanne Devon (AKMuckraker), 2013.25.08Cindy Zelman, 2013.25.08Susan Southerland, 2013.25.08Scott Weingold, 2013.25.08Anthony W.
