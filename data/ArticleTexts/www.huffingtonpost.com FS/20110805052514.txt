{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Surveying the current national and international landscape, I often feel that we are living in a split-screen world. And depending on what part of the screen you are looking at, you will have a very different perception of where things stand. Nowhere is this split-screen reality more pronounced than in the African-American community. On one side, it\u0027s a bleak picture: crushing unemployment, widening income and wealth disparity, and a disproportionate number of people in jail. But there is an equally compelling reality on display on the other side of the screen, where we can watch our first black president, our first black attorney general, and the overwhelming influence of the African-American community on fashion, music, sports, and the rest of popular culture. HuffPost BlackVoices, launching today, will cover both sides of the screen, focusing on current events and cultural trends from a black perspective. Check it out and let us know what you think.Read Post | CommentsPeter S.

Because the market\u0027s tendency is to ratchet up the pain for those who fail to recognize its message.Read Post | CommentsMary Gallagher, 8/3/11Served in Air Force and Air Force Reserves 2001-2011, Plaintiff, Cioca v. RumsfeldMy attacker took away my military career and stole my love for the military.

Were these photos engendering action, or merely pity or worst apathy?Read Post | CommentsSteven Weber, 8/4/11Actor, wise-assTo buy into the writ-in-crayon meme of Obama having \"let us down\" or that he is in any way \"less than what we hoped he would be\" makes us into the slobbering chumps we have characterized our opposition to be.Read Post | CommentsRev.

Security Council for the first time condemned the government\u0027s use of force against civilians and its gross violations of human rights.Read Post | CommentsGordon Brown, 8/4/11Former Prime Minister of the United KingdomEuropean leaders were quick to define last month\u0027s Euro summit of 2011 as the day European leaders seized the moment and faced the crisis down. Instead it will be seen as a huge missed opportunity, the turning point at which history failed to turn.Read Post | CommentsKurt Michael Friese, 8/4/11Chef, Author, AdvocateAs a group, the American people decided we were unable to raise our children with the understanding that wine, beer and cocktails are foods, and so we asked our government to treat them as drugs.Read Post | CommentsDave Pell, 8/4/11Author, \u0027Tweetage Wasteland: Confessions of an Internet Superhero\u0027The other day, I asked my son if he wanted Daddy or Mommy to take him on the bus for his first day of Kindergarten. He answered: \"I want the iPad to take me.\" Who can blame him?Read Post | CommentsIssa Rae, 8/4/11I make stuff upIt\u0027s one thing when other African-Americans try to threaten my race card, but when people outside of my ethnicity have the audacity to question how \"down\" I am because of the bleak, stereotypical picture pop culture has painted for me, as a Black woman? Unacceptable.Read Post | CommentsHeidi Klum, 8/4/11Model, ActressHaving four children, with one having straight hair and three curly, it\u0027s a bit of a new world for me.

I need it because I\u0027m headed to Washington to get arrested in front of the White House.Read Post | CommentsBob Cesca, 8/4/11Producer, Editor of BobCesca.comWe lost. Middle and working class Americans. We\u0027re the losers in the debt ceiling debate. Not President Obama or the Democrats. And it was always going to be this way.
