{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Howard FinemanEditorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupWhatever his flaws, the United States and its allies are counting on Erdogan. They need him to not fail. They don’t want a coup, either from the right (the army) or the Islamists. Above all, the allies want stability, which is what they have always wanted from the Turks, who sit astride history and geography and faith as no other people. The United States and Europe have military alliances they want to keep. Israel has a neighbor it doesn’t (for now) have to fear in an existential way. Arabs want a place to invest and to vacation. They have purchased many of the grand old homes along the Bosporus. It is a lovely and historic Islamic riviera, where old wooden summer villas cost millions. Nobody wants this to end, or end badly.Comments (148)Tom Zeller Jr.Senior Writer, The Huffington PostVirtually no one should be surprised to learn that climate talks currently underway in Bonn, Germany -- the latest venue for the decades-old and largely fruitless pursuit of international agreement on global warming action -- are descending into chaos.Comments (102)Ozan VarolAssistant Professor of Law at Lewis \u0026 Clark Law SchoolHistory has prominent examples that demonstrate the power of non-violent resistance against government repression. The Turks are in the process of crafting a story that exemplifies how the power of humor and innovation can be effectively harnessed against repression and abuse.Comments (66)Nathan SchneiderEditor, Killing the BuddhaThe personal computer is political. The time for liberation has kind of come.Comments (156)Jenny IsenmanHumor columnist, Jen X\u0027pert, Jenny From the Blog at TheSuburbanJungle.comAh, \"Momisms,\" those phrases we turn to get a short reprieve, to conceal criticism, to maintain our sanity or simply because we have no clue what our child just said and we\u0027re trying to go with it.Comments (25)Dan FroomkinContributing editor, Nieman ReportsPursuing day-in day-out accountability reporting is more challenging than ever in a world of diminished journalistic resources and increasing spin. But battling misinformation is a special and essential kind of watchdog journalism.CommentsMeagan ReedMPA candidate, Woodrow Wilson SchoolJust remember, next time you\u0027re buying a book at the airport, speeding on the highway, posting a Tweet, sending a text message, or reading an article like this one online: They\u0027re always watching - and we\u0027re the ones who decided we could live with that.Comments (68)Morris W. O\u0027KellyHost of \"The Mo\u0027Kelly Show\" on KFI am640 and XM Satellite RadioEither Zimmerman killed Trayvon Martin in cold blood or he didn\u0027t. I\u0027m here to tell you, Trayvon Martin smoking marijuana and/or having been suspended from school is not in any way connected to why George Zimmerman killed him.Comments (372)Sarah KleinAssociate Editor, Healthy LivingThirty seconds of triceps dips on a chair (the seventh exercise out of 12) would have been more aptly named triceps dips to exhaustion, and I think I just barely cranked out six reps of move number 11, pushups with rotation.CommentsFlynt and Hillary Mann LeverettGoing To Tehran authors; Penn State Professor and American University Senior LecturerThis year\u0027s presidential campaign, like its predecessors, challenges Westerners\u0027 deep attachment to myths of the Islamic Republic\u0027s illegitimacy and fragility.CommentsHazel Markus and Alana ConnerAs the world gets smaller and hotter, people with different cultural backgrounds are fighting more than ever before. Whites argue that racial discrimination is no longer a problem, while Blacks and Latinos argue that discrimination is keeping them down.Comments (14)Valerie JarrettSenior Advisor and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsTo compete on an even playing field, we need to create our own field with teammates that respect and support what it takes for us to be healthy and whole.CommentsCameron DouglasActorThere are half a million other people in the U.S. who, like me, will go to sleep behind bars tonight because of nothing more than a drug law violation.Comments (203)Terry O\u0027NeillPresident, National Organization for WomenWould a responsible parent wish to deny their child urgently needed health care? Not many parents would. But that\u0027s exactly what they are saying when they conflate the medical conversation about emergency contraception with the personal conversation about teenage sexuality.CommentsCaci CooperOperations AnalystI reflected on the things I wish I\u0027d known about or been told about before the wedding. The taboo things, the uncomfortable bits, the parts that you just don\u0027t talk about or maybe even the advice I was told but didn\u0027t believe. Hopefully they\u0027ll help another bride (or groom) to be.CommentsHamdi UlukayaFounder, President and CEO, Chobani Inc.If the Industrial Age belonged to the oil barons; the Post-War Era, to the baby boomers; and the past decade, to the Silicon Valley hackers--this Post-Great Recession era can belong to the manufacturer. That is, if we take hold and help America get back to its roots.CommentsPaula Davis-LaackLawyer turned stress \u0026 resilience expertPeople often get stuck because of fear, guilt, or simply not knowing which way to go next. In order to achieve bigger goals, take smaller steps.CommentsAmy WrubleBlogger, \"Carriage Before Marriage\"After a few years of not being able to read the fine print, I broke down and bought my first pair of reading glasses. It was like the reverse of a teen nervously buying condoms. \"First pair of reading glasses,\" I informed the clerk, just to prove that I\u0027m not at all embarrassed. \"My mom wears those,\" she smiled. And now I\u0027m mortified.Comments (194)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027As part of its overall economic strategy, the Obama administration is rushing full speed ahead with two major trade deals. It is reasonable to say that these deals will likely be bad news for most people in the United States.Comments (23)Susan SobbottPresident, American Express OpenPeople everywhere struggle to find work-life balance. A better approach, in my mind, is to pursue work-life integration.CommentsFireSingerAfter years of rap music struggling in the muck and mire of misogyny and money, one of the greatest rappers ever has had it up to here with the \u0027New Slavery\u0027 of commercialism, materialism and hedonism.CommentsMike Weisser\u0027The Gun Guy\u0027 at EvolveOne of the NRA\u0027s first great victories was a prohibition to use federal funds for research into gun violence. We need to end this irrationality now. We should defend the work of scientists who spend their lives trying to save human beings, not offer spurious excuses to negate their efforts.Comments (403)Peter BuffettLeader of Change Our Story, composer, authorI keep coming back to the question, \"how much is enough?\" Now you may think that\u0027s a pretty ironic question coming from the son of one of the richest people in the world. But actually, it might just make me an expert on the subject.Comments (50)Amb. Marc GinsbergFmr. U.S. Ambassador to Morocco \u0026 White House Middle East AdviserFor Turkey\u0027s hard-fought reputation as a moderate, regionally influential power, the unfolding drama risks undermining Turkey\u0027s stability and carefully constructed balance between modernism and Islam.Comments (14)Ann BrenoffSenior Writer, The Huffington PostEnemies, depending on the degree to which you empower them, can rule -- and ruin -- your life. They make your kid not want to play on the soccer team anymore. They make your mother want to skip the dining room and eat in her room at the assisted living place. They make you dread going to office meetings where they seem intent on undermining everything you say.Comments (42)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The irony is we already have a national economic strategy but it\u0027s been dictated largely by powerful global corporations and Wall Street. If we had a strategy designed to increase jobs and wages, what would it look like?Comments (922)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorDisturbingly, those of us who saw the warning signs are routinely ignored or even chastised, while the blatant war mongers, the misleaders, the defrauders and the corporate apologists are given ample time and space to promote their wrongheaded views.Comments (236)Jackie BezosPresident and co-founder, Bezos Family FoundationOn a humid Saturday, June 8th, one million bones created by students, educators, artists and activists were laid on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. as a visual petition to end genocide and mass atrocities.CommentsCooper Smith KochFounder, Cooper Smith Agency and Gay List DailyTo keep the \"Most Magical Place on Earth\" from becoming the most stressful, here are a few real-life tips from our travels that might help your family, too.Comments (18)Kerry H. McManamaCorporate communication professionalI am not a wife. I am not a mother. I am not caring for ailing parents. I do not have an illness that requires special attention. Unlike many women in my age range and at my career level, my responsibilities are to me and me alone... and also to my life.Comments (31)Jedediah PurdyProfessor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027Because North Carolina refused the Obamacare Medicaid expansion, I ended up in handcuffs. That was my trigger, anyway. Statistically, next year more than two thousand people in the state will die who would have lived if NC had accepted federal money to give health insurance to low-income families.Comments (849)Nathan Gardels, 2013.12.06Chris Weigant, 2013.12.06Flynt and Hillary Mann Leverett, 2013.12.06Ebong Eka, 2013.12.06Jonathan Greenstein, 2013.12.06Nadia Cho, 2013.12.06American Statistical Association, 2013.12.06Tim Mattingly, 2013.12.06Faisal J.
