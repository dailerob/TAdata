{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor of Literature at YaleNow that President Obama has signed the new debt ceiling into law and subscribed his party to an austerity program that assumes a state of permanent economic emergency, the question what made him do it? becomes more pressing than ever. Those who want to confine the blame to Republicans say that the opposition party follows the dictates of a fanatical faction.

Kirsten Gillibrand, 8/2/11U.S. Senator from New YorkIt is unfortunate that Congress missed an opportunity today to seriously take on debt reduction with a balanced approach.

As a culture, we\u0027ve left behind the antagonistic, us-versus-them mentality of the 70s and 80s, but we\u0027ve found the modern refrain that \"men and women should be indistinct in the workplace\" rings hollow, too.Read Post | CommentsRobert Guttman, 8/2/11Director, Center on Politics and Foreign Relations (CPFR), Johns Hopkins UniversityAfter criticizing in detail the federal government and arguing that his goal is to save the people from the Supreme Court, one wonders why in the world the governor would want to move to the nation\u0027s capital if it is so terrible.Read Post | CommentsKristin Kirkpatrick, M.S., R.D., L.D., 8/2/11Dietitian and wellness manager, The Cleveland Clinic Wellness Institute and the Cleveland Clinic Lifestyle 180 programThe United States is getting bigger and we have the data to prove it.
