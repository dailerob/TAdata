{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week provided some notable examples of Crime and Punishment in modern America. First, football star Ray Rice received a two-game suspension for knocking unconscious his then-fiancée in a hotel elevator. His coach promptly proclaimed Rice \"a heck of a guy.\" Earlier in the week, Lane Johnson, another NFL player, was suspended four games for taking a performance enhancing drug -- a transgression apparently twice as bad, in the NFL\u0027s eyes, as beating up your soon-to-be-wife. In Arizona, the execution of murderer Joseph Wood went seriously awry, leaving him gasping for air for close to two hours before dying. Despite this grotesque death, Gov. Jan Brewer declared that Wood \"did not suffer,\" but didn\u0027t explain how she could possibly know this. And, finally, there was a very different kind of punishment served up for our entertainment as the trailer for Fifty Shades of Gray was released, attracting nearly 7 million views in just 24 hours. Somewhere, the Marquis de Sade is smiling.Are we going to stand back and spectate while the ugly foundations of a modern day dystopia are laid in front of our eyes? Or will our common humanity unite us and compel us to act to help save the people of Gaza?Queen of the Hashemite Kingdom of JordanWhat impressed me most about Elaine Stritch, my friend, was how she handled the sad moments in her life. Now, I have to handle a sad moment alone -- Elaine is gone.Actor, author of 10 books and a book of poems \"Life Could Be Verse” to be published by HCI, December 2014As the Belgian philosopher Pascal Chabot has put it, burnout is \"civilization\u0027s disease.\" The thought of so many people hunched over their laptops or iPhones, asking Google, \"Why am I so tired?\" or \"Why am I always tired?\" is really sad. And the answer is not going to be given to us by an algorithm. But we can start by shutting off our devices and getting some sleep.North Carolina Congresswoman Renee Ellmers, who is running against Clay Aiken this November, urged the Republican Party, especially men in the party, to bring policy discussion \"down to a woman\u0027s level.\"Activist, advocate and actressIf established climate science, unfolding in real time before our eyes, does not prevail in the current Washington debate, then the fate of the world may look a lot like the dystopia popular in much of current cinema.Singer; Actress; Director; Composer; ActivistIn the final analysis, we really do love democracy -- and watching it dismantled as it\u0027s being dismantled, and corrupted like it\u0027s being corrupted, has taken a lot of us from denial to real depression to a collective \"Hell, no!\" that will have electoral consequences in 2016.AuthorThe war between Hamas and Israel has exposed the folly of both sides. Hamas\u0027 long-standing objective to destroy Israel has come back to haunt it, which may eventually spell its own demise. Conversely, Prime Minister Netanyahu\u0027s unwillingness to end the occupation and the blockade has also shown the folly of his policy.Senior Fellow, NYU\u0027s Center for Global AffairsThe horrible human costs and increasing danger the world is now facing in Gaza, Ukraine, and Iraq show the consequences of not telling the truth. And unfortunately, we seem to mostly have political leaders who are unwilling to admit the truth of what\u0027s happening, deal with root causes instead of exploiting symptoms, and then do everything possible to prevent the escalation of violence and further wars.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersThere is a wall between us ... When we move this wall or bring it down, we find that we are all human beings with similar problems, hardships and tribulations.UN Messenger of PeaceWhen incompetence in the Kremlin turns murderous, its incumbents can begin to tremble. As news of the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine trickled into Russia, people with a long memory recalled the Soviet Union\u0027s attack, 31 years ago this September, on Korean Air Lines Flight 007, and its political consequences.Author “The Lost Khrushchev: A Journey into the Gulag of the Russian Mind.”A Greater Israel cannot be anything but an apartheid state, and exclusionary ethnic nationalism of this sort is not sustainable in the 21st century. Israel\u0027s Arab subjects will eventually demand equal rights, and as former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert warned back in 2007, once that happens, \"the state of Israel is finished.\"Professor of International Affairs, Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of GovernmentCourtesy of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, Putin is now coming to terms with the blowback from his Ukrainian adventure, a hybrid non-linear political-military campaign fought largely through local proxies, and this is something that will dog him for as long as he is in power.Professor of Global Affairs at NYU’s Center for Global Affairs; Founding Editor of the journal \u0027Global Crime\u0027I came to thank you for the privilege you granted me to serve our country and its people for the past seven years. There is no greater privilege. Thank you. Israel, this small country, became a truly great state.President of the State of IsraelThe Internet, social media and mass mobilized movements have not only defiantly displayed our ability to care, but also, that we can act upon it. But when it comes to war, have we truly organized ourselves beyond the sporadic stunts of protests and popular retweets?Technology evangelist; philanthropist; entrepreneurIs it possible to forgive a murderer? What if that murderer is you? This former drug dealer and convicted murderer was in solitary confinement when he had the awakening that would change his life forever.\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"We believe that an informed public will not give away its public schools to amateurs, hedge fund managers, rock stars, for-profit corporations, athletes, fly-by-night entrepreneurs, and religious groups.Research Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027After watching continuous acts of police abuse and brutality from coast-to-coast, perhaps the real question is, have we reached a point where federal authorities need to step in?President, National Action NetworkWe must make sure that our children and all of us know our history and that the atrocities that wiped out the lives of countless individuals who died for freedom and justice during the Civil Rights Movement do not ever happen again. We must all do our part to create a safe and hopeful nation for every child.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundDon\u0027t expect your partner to read your mind, or to bring you breakfast in bed, or to offer to wash the dishes. It\u0027s not going to happen. You can\u0027t expect anything from anyone -- you have to make your desires known.Freelance writer and graphic designerThink of how different the school years of all kids -- rich and poor -- would be if education were aligned with life, instead of tailored to the needs of Princeton statisticians. We might begin to make progress after decades of failed education reform,.Charles E. Ducommun Professor of Education at Stanford University; Faculty Director, Stanford Center for Opportunity Policy in EducationVenture capitalist, venture philanthropist, education strategist, and funder of documentaries.My default mode is to see and focus on my flaws and imperfections. I\u0027m starting to see a bit more.Stay-at-home mother of two and author, BridgetteTales.comBullying behavior (especially if such behavior seems to be rewarded) can encourage non-bullies, or victims, to take up abusive behavior themselves. In this way, the act of bullying by one individual can impact an entire company by fostering behavior that trickles down the entire organizational ladder.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarIt is difficult to watch a war in real time. And the facts, and the causes, and the solutions all play second fiddle to the horror and tragedy of war. It makes compelling TV. And we learn nothing.Academy Award-winning director, screenwriter and producerNo one thinks that this is something that could happen to them. No nurse thinks this is going to be her patient. But it can happen, it does happen, and it is happening every day in the United States.Registered nurse behind the blog Adventures of a Labor Nurse: the Highs and Lows of Labor and DeliveryThe European Court of Human Rights yesterday ruled against Poland, charging our ally with human rights violations for helping the CIA operate an \u0027extraordinary rendition\u0027 program. But no one at the CIA has ever been prosecuted for torturing suspects.Fmr. 16-year member of US Congress; Two-time US presidential candidateCharming and funny, he was also entirely unassuming. He got good grades, had lots of friends. He was a talented artist and student. He was also a dude who raped me. The fact that he\u0027s sweet and loves his mom doesn\u0027t change the fact that he had sex with me against my will.Writer, editor, drag queen enthusiastFederal Reserve Board Chair Janet Yellen made waves in her Congressional testimony last week when she argued that social media and biotech stocks were over-valued. She also said that the price of junk bonds was out of line with historic experience. By making these assertions in a highly visible public forum, Yellen was using the power of the Fed\u0027s megaphone to stem the growth of incipient bubbles. This is an approach that some of us have advocated for close to twenty years.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027I am the last person you would expect to be among the long-term unemployed. Now I\u0027ve moved in with my mother, back into my childhood bedroom.Registered and licensed dietitian and nutritionist; adjunct professorWhile most veterans transition back to civilian life successfully, many still struggle. Securing steady employment in a rewarding, lucrative and long-term career is an enormous part of that transition.Actor and Founder of the Gary Sinise FoundationToday\u0027s news media is a drug pusher, and negative news is their drug.
