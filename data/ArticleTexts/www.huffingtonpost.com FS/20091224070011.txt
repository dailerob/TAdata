{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOTime for my annual tradition of getting gifts for my favorite -- and not so favorite -- public figures. This year, I\u0027m getting Joe Lieberman a DVD of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington so he can see the proper use of a filibuster -- to fight corruption, not promote it.

I won\u0027t be giving anything to health insurance and drug company lobbyists -- they\u0027re getting enough from the Senate and the White House this Christmas. Check out the rest of my list, then post your gift ideas for public figures in the comments section. We\u0027ll collect the best ones and unwrap them on Christmas Day.Read Post | Comments (27)BIORobert Creamer, 12.23.2009Political organizer, strategist and authorThose who are critical of Obama need to remember something: health insurance reform is an achievement that has eluded presidents for decades.
