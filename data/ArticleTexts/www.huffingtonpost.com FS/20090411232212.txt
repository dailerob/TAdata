Change can be accomplished at the stroke of a pen.Read Post | CommentsBIOArianna Huffington, 04.09.2009For me, the key question is whether those of us working in the media embrace and adapt to the radical changes brought about by the Internet or pretend that we can somehow hop into a journalistic Way Back Machine and return to a past that no longer exists.Read Post | Comments (339)BIOLouise Nelson Dyble, 04.10.2009When the government agency overseeing mass transit and the government agency building highways are distinct and uncoordinated, they compete for money, and the public loses.Read Post | CommentsBIOSteve Clemons, 04.10.2009Director of the American Strategy Program at the New America FoundationObama\u0027s point guy on the upcoming Summit of the Americas offered me the neocon-friendly, ideologically vapid answer to my question on Cuba.
