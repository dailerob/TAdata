{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Practically every facet of our society was altered by 9/11 in some way, either by the attacks themselves, or, especially, by our response to the attacks -- a response that continues to evolve. Looking back ten years later we can finally begin to get a sense of just how the country was changed, and what elements of our society we\u0027d previously taken for granted. Starting today, with a special section titled \"9/11: A Decade After\", we will be examining those changes from all angles, collecting stories from across all of HuffPost, from the economy to national security, politics, education, parenting, pop culture, and the arts. The conversation starts here.Read Post | Comments (181)Dan Collins, 9/9/11New York Editor-At-Large of The Huffington PostTen years later, it\u0027s easier to acknowledge where we fell short.

Smith, 9/9/11President Obama put conservatives in a bind with his jobs speech. If they co-operate in helping their fellow citizens, they violate their code of personal responsibility without social responsibility.

Thank you for your sovereign grace that guides us beyond one moment of terror to a collective destiny beyond that moment.Read Post | Comments (15)Derek Henry Flood, 9/9/11Independent Editor, Writer and PhotojournalistA decade of talking about who has won and who has lost is both immaterial and intellectually childish. It was never about winning or losing. It is about carrying on with life. Getting on with the business of this awkwardly, unevenly integrating world.Read Post | CommentsAdam Winkler, 9/9/11Professor of Law, UCLAGun control advocates fear, and gun rights proponents sometimes hope, the Second Amendment will transform our cities into modern-day versions of Dodge.
