{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Chairman, U.S. Economy/Smart Globalization Initiative at the New America FoundationObama and the Democrats in Congress want to preserve the Bush tax cuts that benefit the middle class and lower income earners, while letting those provisions that benefit only people with very high incomes expire on schedule at the end of this year. The Republicans disagree. And thus things sit. Well, thank God for Reps. Peter DeFazio and Marcy Kaptur, who just put forward a proposal in the House that I believe no responsible Member of Congress -- whether in the House or the Senate, whether Democrat, Republican or Tea Partier -- should find objectionable.Read Post | CommentsJason Linkins, 10.05.2010If people running Democratic campaigns are worried about the Rally To Restore Sanity stealing away volunteers, then it\u0027s time they did some soul-searching and ask themselves why their candidates don\u0027t elicit the same devotion.Read Post | CommentsRichard (RJ) Eskow, 10.05.2010Consultant, Writer, Senior Fellow with The Campaign for America\u0027s FutureThe real question about Jerome Kerviel\u0027s sentence is for our country, not France: Where are the US indictments and convictions? The US bankers who engaged in criminal behavior are walking around free, writing big checks to political candidates.Read Post | CommentsAl Franken and Joe Solmonese, 10.05.2010If schools work to create positive cultures and if Congress passes the Student Non-Discrimination Act, those steps will be a huge stride forward in protecting LGBT students from the bullying that is all too common in schools today.Read Post | CommentsDaphne Eviatar, 10.05.2010Senior Associate in Human Rights First’s Law and Security ProgramThe alleged torture of Ghailani in a secret CIA prison hangs heavy over this case -- as it will every other one where detainees were subjected to the so-called \"enhanced interrogation techniques.\"Read Post | CommentsRobert Redford, 10.05.2010Actor, Director, and Environmental ActivistThe oil and gas industry poured $174 million into the political system in 2009. When one dirty industry can purchase that much influence, who will step into the ring for average Americans?Read Post | CommentsRobert Mackey, 10.05.2010Lieutenant Colonel, U.S. Army (Retired)An underground current in the U.S. military\u0027s officer corps believes that their legally elected civilian leaders can be disobeyed if an officer believes their orders to be \"immoral.\" This, ladies and gentlemen, is a real problem.Read Post | CommentsJeanne Devon (\"AKMuckraker\"), 10.05.2010Managing Editor of themudflats.netInternal emails obtained by The Mudflats provide the most conclusive evidence to date that Palin will be running for president, and also indicate a behind-the-scenes rift between the Palins and an Alaskan candidate.Read Post | Comments (2,232)Zach Carter, 10.05.2010Economics Editor, AlterNet; Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureRepublicans have not only pledged to set Wall Street loose, they\u0027ve vowed not to clean-up the economic mess that results. When Wall Street sets the economy on fire, they\u0027ll let it burn -- if that means home, your job, or your retirement, so be it.Read Post | CommentsSteve Clemons, 10.05.2010Publisher of \"The Washington Note\"Can it be that American military bases abroad, usually thought of as \"stabilizers\" in tough neighborhoods, are really the primary cause of radical terrorism against the US and its allies?Read Post | CommentsGreg Mitchell, 10.05.2010Blogger, The Nation, \"Media Fix\"Parker is not a Tea Party or Coulter wingnut. But she pushed the not-\"full-blooded\"-American envelope in 2008 when Barack Obama was running for president.Read Post | CommentsArianna Huffington, 10.04.2010With the White House pushing its Race to the Top initiative, and Waiting for \"Superman\" sparking a national conversation about American schools, America is having an Education Moment. As such, we\u0027ve launched a new section: HuffPost Education.Read Post | CommentsAndy Kroll, 10.05.2010Staff writer for Mother Jones magazineFacing an economy that may never again generate in such quantity the sorts of \"middle class\" jobs Rick Rembold was used to, what we may be seeing is the creation of a graying class of permanently unemployed (or underemployed) Americans.Read Post | CommentsJoseph A. Palermo, 10.05.2010Associate Professor, American History, California State University, SacramentoNo wonder the conventional wisdom in Washington holds, without evidence, that the United States is a \"center-right\" country. Those making that argument might not be real, informed commentators -- but they play them on TV.Read Post | CommentsMatt Kane, 10.05.2010Blogger, The Second AgeChristine O\u0027Donnell has created quite a stir with her first political advertisement. The advertisement is perfect for O\u0027Donnell because it sums up her entire candidacy: it\u0027s a joke.Read Post | CommentsBill McKibben, 10.05.2010Looking back a few weeks, we were bitterly disappointed when the White House failed to act on our request that they put solar panels back on the roof. But in truth, I\u0027m almost happy that they waited.Read Post | CommentsMaureen Evans, 10.05.2010Eat Tweet is the world\u0027s first cookbook written entirely in Twitterese.

It bothers me that Meg Whitman didn\u0027t do anything to help her. And it bothers me that she lied about it.Read Post | CommentsDoug Kendall and Ian Millhiser, 10.05.2010Holding rank-and-file judicial nominees hostage to advance a larger political agenda is the current political \"nuclear option\" and, if this continues, it is the judiciary and Americans seeking justice who will bear the fallout.Read Post | CommentsJonathan A. Schein, 10.05.2010Founder of ScheinMediaI\u0027m not sure which is worse: using bailout money to fund the making of outdated, gas-guzzling automobiles, or to pay executives to oversee the creation of embarrassingly bad advertisements for those cars.Read Post | CommentsMarc Rosenbaum, 10.05.2010Education for ExcellenceWhere do our students learn how not to value education and speak disrespectfully to each other, their teachers, and other adults in their lives? For the vast majority, the answer can be found in their homes.Read Post | CommentsKeli Goff, 10.04.2010Author, commentator and contributor to TheLoop21.comThe kids doing the bullying are not really the ones at fault. The message they are receiving from adults is that today in 2010 it may not be okay to call someone the N-word on the playground, but it is okay to call someone the F-word.Read Post | CommentsDana Milbank, 10.05.2010Political reporter, Washington Post; Author, \u0027Tears of a Clown\u0027Large numbers of Mormons watch Beck, but likely an even larger number of his viewers and radio listeners are evangelical Protestants who have no idea that Beck is preaching to them an obscure prophecy of the Latter-day Saints.Read Post | CommentsAdam McKay, 10.04.2010Film director; Co-Founder, Funny or DiePlease California, don\u0027t elect Meg Whitman as our Governor. For real. Don\u0027t do it.

Chesnoff, 10.02.2010Understandably, some American Jews were annoyed that Obama had failed to include Israel in his July 2009 Mideast trip. But what rankled them even more was that the president seemed to adopt the Arab narrative to explain the existence of Israel.Read Post | CommentsScott Mendelson, M.D., 2010.10.06Matthieu Ricard, 2010.10.06Dan Solin, 2010.10.05Jeff Sneider, 2010.10.05Larry Magid, 2010.10.05Jennie Nash, 2010.10.05Richard (RJ) Eskow, 2010.10.05Maureen Costello, 2010.10.05Adele Scheele, 2010.10.05Shawn Amos, 2010.10.05","h1":"Using a mobile device?
