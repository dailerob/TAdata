Until now, it worked.Read Post | Comments (17)Rob Reiner, Bruce Cohen and Michele Reiner, 11/28/12There will be a natural tendency to focus on the legal challenges and the political fights, but history will show the true story of how we achieved marriage equality and how it was in fact a quilt woven of thousands of personal tales, most of which existed entirely outside the courtroom.Read Post | CommentsMarc Lamont Hill, 11/28/12Host of HuffPost Live and Our World With Black EnterpriseI\u0027m sad that Linsanity turned out to be a sham. The truth is that Jeremy Lin can\u0027t play. At least not at the highest levels. And no amount of \"Linsanity\" can change that.Read Post | Comments (266)Jose Barreiro, 11/28/12Assistant Director for Research, National Museum of the American IndianFrom Yucatan to Honduras and centrally throughout Guatemala, the new scholarship on Maya is a veritable industry.

Kirsten Gillibrand, 11/28/12U.S. Senator from New YorkThe fact is, as a consequence of unprecedented obstructionism during the last Congress, the filibuster was used more in two years than it had been in the 1950s, \u002760s and \u002770s combined.
