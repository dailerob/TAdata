{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"6.0% reportingThe Iowa caucuses will be getting underway in just a few hours, and normally, as events speed themselves toward the conclusion of a thing, one expects bewilderment to fade and for a certain amount of well ... certainty to start to congeal. But this is Iowa, in an election year, and the whole point is that you are not supposed to have any clue about what is going to happen. But don\u0027t let so-called experts make you feel bad for feeling out-of-the-loop as they casually make predictions. They don\u0027t have the slightest idea what\u0027s going on, either!Read Post | Comments (1,364)Matthew Dowd, 01/ 3/12Political strategistRomney is definitely the candidate to beat in this race, but let\u0027s let this process play out for a while. So far, we have seen more twists and turns in this race than in a California yoga class.Read Post | Comments (20)James Moore, 01/ 3/12Author, \u0027Adios Mofo: Why Rick Perry Will Make America Miss George W. Bush\u0027Mitt Romney has money and the moderate politics to give the president a tough fight in the fall. But he doesn\u0027t give his own party those sweaty palms of excitement. He could have a very miserable 2012.Read Post | Comments (50)Marty Kaplan, 01/ 3/12Director, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolFor seven days I didn\u0027t have salt, meat or CNN. My mornings began without Morning Joe or Morning Edition; I saw sunrise on a mountain hike, not with a clicker in my hand. There\u0027s nothing like a little media fast to remind you how little it costs to be a bit out of it.Read Post | Comments (29)Rep. Gwen Moore, 01/ 3/12U.S. Representative for Wisconsin\u0027s 4th Congressional DistrictThe only thing \"unusual\" about the recall movement is Scott Walker\u0027s inability to listen to the will of the people of Wisconsin. As soon as he was elected he forgot who he was there to represent.Read Post | Comments (402)Lanny Davis, 01/ 3/12Lawyer, Lanny J. Davis and Associates LLCIt doesn\u0027t matter if Mitt Romney wins the Iowa caucuses tonight or not. He is about to experience a severe political hemorrhage.Read Post | Comments (63)Scott Mendelson, 01/ 3/12Film Critic at Mendelson\u0027s Memos, Valley Scene MagazineWhile most critics make a point to try to seek out the allegedly best in cinema in any given year, not quite as much effort is made to track down every would-be stinker.Read Post | Comments (17)Fawaz Gerges, 01/ 3/12Professor of International Relations, London School of EconomicsShrouded in myth and inflated by a self-sustaining industry of so-called terrorism \"experts\" and a well-funded national security industrial complex, the power of Al-Qaeda can only be eradicated when the fantasies around the group are laid to rest.Read Post | CommentsJodyne L.

Some have lingered longer than most marriages, yet others still hover around or are merely a reflection of personal wishes. Some were so ahead of their time as to be forgotten or \"invented\" by someone else.Read Post | CommentsGary W.

The exercise she got on those stairs and errands may not only have protected her heart so she could live past 100, it may also have protected her brain.Read Post | Comments (28)Ayesha Mattu and Nura Maznavi, 01/ 3/12Buried in the \"controversy\" over Bradley Cooper\u0027s selection as People\u0027s most recent Sexiest Man Alive is a little known fact: If you had polled American Muslim women the winner would have been -- wait for it -- Jon Stewart.Read Post | Comments (127)Justin Levitt, 01/ 3/12Associate professor, Loyola Law SchoolIn the first days of 2012, it\u0027s useful to take stock of our democratic infrastructure -- and, since we\u0027re in the thick of the redistricting cycle, to gauge our national progress in drawing the lines that will determine representation for the next ten years.Read Post | CommentsLarry Magid, 01/ 3/12Technology journalistLet\u0027s be honest. Many children -- especially post-pubescent boys -- are interested in what we commonly call \"porn.\" You might not like the idea that some kids are looking at these images, but that doesn\u0027t change the fact that it\u0027s a pretty common occurrence.Read Post | Comments (76)James Peron, 01/ 3/12President, Moorfield Storey InstituteThe moment someone tells me \"marriage has always been\" something or another, I know they are ignorant of the actual history of marriage. It has never \"always\" been anything. It has taken different forms, with different social rules attached.Read Post | Comments (32)Bernard-Henri Lévy, 01/ 3/12French philosopher; WriterBeginning in 1915, the Armenians were the victims of a methodic attempt at annihilation. No serious historian casts doubt upon this reality or denies it. It is the negationist revisionists who, up until now, have hampered the work of historians.Read Post | Comments (55)Evie M.

After all, destroying another country is a big deal.Read Post | Comments (19)John Feffer, 01/ 3/12Co-director, Foreign Policy In FocusThe backlash happening today in Moscow is a combination of the tea party movement and Occupy Wall Street.
