{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The attacks on Paris demonstrate that ISIS and its local sympathizers are capable of hitting civilian targets almost at will. Unlike al-Qaeda, ISIS is partly decentralized, and far more difficult for police and intelligence to infiltrate or monitor. On the other hand, fanatical zealots tend to overreach, just as Hitler disastrously overreached when he invaded Soviet Russia. In its recent actions, ISIS has over-reached. In the past few weeks, ISIS or its sympathizers blew up a Russian civilian airliner and suicide-bombed a neighborhood in Beirut controlled by Hezbollah, in addition to its barbaric attacks in Paris. This all may be consistent with ISIS\u0027s warped world view--but it is strategic insanity. You can\u0027t attack everybody without bringing everybody into a coalition against you.We must not send those fleeing persecution back to their persecutors. The definition of moral courage is to resist allowing fear to overwhelm our humanity.Director of Immigration Policy, Niskanen CenterFrance is no longer at peace, that\u0027s for sure. A terrorist group-turned-state HAS Declared war on us. It\u0027s sending soldiers to commit war crimes is our soil. Even more importantly, the Islamic State is not targeting us for what we\u0027re doing, aim for who we are. A free, secular and life-loving country.Writer, co-founder of the journal ProChoix (feminist, anti-racist and secularist) and a famous columnist in FranceAbd al-Wahhab argued that all Muslims must individually pledge their allegiance to a single Muslim leader (a Caliph, if there were one). Those who would not conform to this view should be killed, their wives and daughters violated, and their possessions confiscated, he wrote.Fmr. MI-6 agent; Author, \u0027Resistance: The Essence of Islamic Revolution\u0027The race to increase security is in full swing. Posing realistic, applicable, or useful measures doesn\u0027t seem to be taking first priority; instead, there\u0027s talking for talking\u0027s sake, and the publishing of words that seem to echo the fears of the French.Editorial Director, Le Huffington PostI\u0027ll pray that the politicization of death ends soon. And for people to recognize the irony of dismissing victims anywhere and everywhere based on politics, race, color and religion.World Social Media EditorWe cannot tolerate intolerance and violent extremist views that are unwilling to accept co-existence with others different from themselves. These extremists are the minority in our society, but unfortunately those who are practicing active tolerance are also in the minority. There are too many of us sitting in silence, unable or unwilling to take action.Founder and Chairman of Generations For PeaceNot long ago, in the run up to George W. Bush\u0027s invasion of Iraq, these same right-wing Republicans were screaming epithets at France because the country that today the corporate media remind us is \"our oldest ally\" tried to stop the war before it began.Professor, historian, authorDuring Obama\u0027s time in office, his administration has taken no action to actually rebalance the system so candidates are accountable to ordinary Americans, not just wealthy special interests. As the president enters his final 14 months, he would do well to consider how history will remember him on this issue.CEO of MAYDAY.US, Associate Law Professor at Fordham, Corruption ScholarRI State Representative, Former Congressional Candidate, Demand Progress Exec DirectorIf all we do is destroy ISIS, other terrorist organizations will spring up in what would continue to be an ungoverned space. We need a coherent political solution, which will best be constructed through diplomacy, not the war rooms of the Pentagon, NATO and Moscow.Supreme Commander of NATO (2009-2013); Dean, Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts UniversityThe logic of this is clear; refugees are fleeing Bashar al-Assad, the Islamic State or both. Having experienced the extreme disruption of Syria\u0027s brutal civil war caused by the Assad regime\u0027s brutal crackdown on domestic uprisings and the subsequent exploitation of this disruption by ISIS, they are unlikely to entertain illusions about the merits of violence.Independent source of news and analysis, from the academic and research community.In war, choose love. In despair, choose love. When the good and bad becomes relative concepts and appear to be grey, choose love. When you don\u0027t know whom to blame about the magnitude of atrocities around you, choose love. Because every life matters, whether it is reported in the media or not.Dentistry Student, Writer, Activist, Humanitarian, Sri Lankan \u0026 Canadian, GlobalIt is important for us at this time of great sadness to stand together and process this horrific incident in a way that is fair and just. It is important that we refrain from demonizing Muslims without cause -- not because that would benefit Muslims, but because our ability to eradicate terror depends on it.Egyptian Grand Mufti, Professor of Islamic LawThe right-wing\u0027s manic desire to turn every horrific and bloody terror attack into a political vendetta against immigrants and Muslims is a worn script. But it\u0027s a serviceable one.Author and political analystThese failings hurt the charter school operators who are trying to operate aboveboard with students\u0027 best interests in mind. And rampant charter expansion undermines traditional public schools. A proposal to \"charterize\" half of the public schools in Los Angeles would not just disrupt the public school system, it would destroy it.President, American Federation of TeachersParis is burning. The world is in mourning. Richard Dawkins, among others, has wasted no time in blaming not only ISIS but Islam.Theologian, cyclist, fatherOne morning as I scanned the news--horror in the Middle East, Russia and America facing off in the Ukraine, I thought of Edward Snowden and wondered how he was holding up in Moscow. I began to imagine a conversation with him and a few others.Makes films; Board member, Freedom of the Press FoundationAuthor, \u0027The God of Small Things\u0027 and \u0027Capitalism: A Ghost Story\u0027As we stand mourning the loss of life in Paris, Beirut, and others we also should be mourning our lack of humanity. Because we seem to forget that while we in the Western world experience violence as an anomaly, these refugees face that violence daily.Tech Market Strategies; Lawyer\"Why isn\u0027t the media covering this?\" I saw several Facebook posts exclaim, while sharing a link to a BBC News story on the tragedy. a) The media did cover this. You are sharing a BBC News link to the story.Showbiz reporter at the @Daily_Star OnlineThe dance music and sporting events on the TVs were replaced with a news station and its audio. Chatter was reduced to whispered confusion. We were sending messages to loved ones to let them know we were safe and away from danger. But then more news trickled in.Youth RadioBy accumulating so much power, Erdogan will now be free to label any opponent as enemies of the state, or in AKP terminology, \u0027enemies of the national will.\u0027Visiting Assistant Professor Georgetown UniversityCertain actions have a pernicious and corrosive effect on democratic institutions and should be considered as violations of the Constitution. I believe that a persuasive case can be made that five actions by President Barack Obama meet this standard.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghIt is a hard thing to realize that for all that was said, for all the progressive rhetoric we have managed to create as a seemingly united human voice, most of us members of this curious species are still excluded from the dominant concerns of the \"world.\"Setting a unique news agenda that builds bridges and global understanding since 2005.Not long after, when America entered the war, we were formally collaborating with Josef Stalin -- a man who had slaughtered one million of his own countrymen during the Great Purge of 1937-38. The lesson is that, when faced with an existential threat, you bring all parties to the table. Even bad people if you have to. Not just to coordinate the fight, but to coordinate post-war planning with all the players.Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranOf course we\u0027re thinking about Paris. Do we really -- each and, it seemed, every single one of us -- need to repeat the same trite words or post the same stock photos to prove as much? Is it not enough to just feel anymore, without taking to social media to put those feelings on display?Author, research psychologist and gender scholarLet me assure you that \"personalized learning\" is a far, far cry from the type of education we got at Exeter. Students may be in control of their \"learning trajectory,\" in such a model, but not of their own minds, as we were at Exeter. In my humble opinion, this is a bastardization of true education.Teacher, education activist and blogger at www.emilytalmage.comThis week, a new company called Diamond Foundry announced that it is able to \"grow\" hundreds of perfect, \"real\" diamonds (up to nine carats) in just two weeks in a lab. Martin Roscheisen is about to disrupt an industry that has been built on scarcity for centuries.Chairman/CEO, XPRIZEIn the United States, the immigrant story is part of the blueprint of our country. It disheartens me to see my community or any other culture under attack. Some presidential candidates do not seem to care that by promoting negative stereotypes, they are alienating one of the biggest voting blocs in America.Actor and activistFor a highly disciplined candidate like Clinton, this most unpredictable of campaign exercises would appear to pose serious risk with minimal potential for reward.Professor of Journalism, Northeastern University, BostonBefore jumping on the \"tough on terrorism\" bandwagon, candidates should reflect on the lessons learned in the 14 years since the 9/11 terror attacks, and consider what actually works to counter this global problem - and what doesn\u0027t.Senior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstHillary Clinton might be a liberal icon to some, but in reality, she\u0027s the only candidate with neoconservative advisers and a hawkish foreign policy. If you dread more American involvement in the Middle East, perhaps Clinton might not be your choice for president.Columnist published in The Cleveland Plain Dealer, The Baltimore Sun, The Hill, Salon, The Jerusalem Post www.hagoodman.comGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
