{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Author, \u0027Unfriendly Fire: How the Gay Ban Undermines the Military and Weakens America\u0027There\u0027s a reason the current president promised to be \"no-drama Obama.\" It\u0027s a promise he\u0027s delivered on, and that has served the country well. Those who want to know what a re-elected Obama is likely to do should not be distracted by his underwhelming recent performances. They should look back at his first-term record and note how consistent it is with his pragmatic and moderate personal character: an effective, but ultimately modest, balanced stimulus that\u0027s helped turn the economy around; the achievement, at long-last, of near-universal healthcare using an idea originating in conservative circles; the comeback of that emblem of American capitalism, the auto industry; winding down two wars and killing al Qaeda\u0027s leader in a bold but limited strike that deployed smart power rather than chest-thumping militarism; advancing and protecting reproductive and LGBT rights.Read Post | Comments (12)Robert Reich, 10/09/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Republicans are well practiced in the politics of fear and the logistics of the big lie. The challenge for Obama and Biden and for the rest of us over the next four weeks is to counter their fearsome lies with the truth.Read Post | CommentsColin J. Parris, 10.09.2012PhD, General Manager, Power Systems, IBM Systems \u0026 Technology GroupIt was in the 1950s and 1960s that the \"Space Race\" inspired the world and captivated students everywhere. Today, the United States faces an even greater challenge if it hopes to lead the race in creating a Smarter Planet.Read Post | Comments (29)Marlo Thomas, 10/09/12Award-winning actress, author, and activistWe all know that carrying too much weight can cause serious health problems. Obesity can lead to diseases that can threaten our lives. But that needn\u0027t force us to hold ourselves to one ideal. And, hey, who gets to decide what\u0027s beautiful?Read Post | Comments (156)Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm, 10/08/12Former governor of Michigan; Host, \u0027The War Room\u0027 on Current TV; columnist, Politico; faculty member, UC BerkeleyMr. President, when you walk on stage in the next debate I would like to hear you say that the choice is not just about whose tax plan you like or who has the better health care strategy. It\u0027s much more fundamental than that. This is a choice about our national character.Read Post | Comments (571)Michael Hogan and Christopher Rosen, 10/08/12Welcome to Gold Rush, HuffPost Entertainment\u0027s weekly breakdown of all things Oscar. Between now and Feb. 25, 2013, executive arts and entertainment editor Michael Hogan and entertainment editor Christopher Rosen will chat about awards season and which films will make the most noise at the 85th annual Academy Awards.Read Post | Comments (61)Dean Baker, 10/09/12Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027President Obama had a bad night when he faced Governor Romney in Denver for the first presidential debate. However, for many listeners the worst moment was when he quite clearly told the country that there was not much difference between his position on Social Security and Governor Romney\u0027s.Read Post | Comments (31)Ramona Duoba, 10/09/12Writer \u0026 TV ProducerWomen in Manhattan work on their careers and wait until the last fertile egg to have a baby. I have many friends in my age group with young children. Though I\u0027m not sure how many actually go to the lengths I do to keep their age from their children.Read Post | Comments (121)Paul Rieckhoff, 10/09/12Founder, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of AmericaNo veteran should come home to an unemployment check. Candidates need to do more, and all Americans need to demand answers on how they plan to support new veterans and their families -- on jobs and other critical issues.Read Post | Comments (80)Carlos M. Duarte, 10/08/12Research Professor, CSIC, at the Mediterranean Institute for Advanced Studies (IMEDEA)What future awaits a society in which the youth only have two options: disappear, or adapt to work conditions that are more often than not abusive, and which require the support of their parents?Read Post | Comments (36)Teddy Wayne, 10/09/12Author, The Love Song of Jonny Valentine and KapitoilUltimately, Governor Romney\u0027s vision of a sunny America in which he sweeps the clouds of recession away to where the air is sweet is as phony as some sort of imaginary, seven-foot-tall, tuskless woolly mammoth. Any adult can see it doesn\u0027t exist.Read Post | CommentsSteve Clemons, 10/08/12Publisher, \u0027The Washington Note\u0027One wonders today whether Romney will ignore or listen to generals today -- all of whom agree that establishing and recognizing a state of Palestine is vital to U.S. national security and to defending Israel\u0027s long-term security in the region.Read Post | Comments (127)Amb. Marc Ginsberg, 10/09/12Former U.S. Ambassador to MoroccoThe good governor\u0027s foreign policy address at the Virginia Military Institute was a slapdash jaunt into \"make believe\" foreign policy -- not a realistic roadmap to a better Middle East. If this is the best the Republican national security team around Romney can offer in the way of a viable alternative to current U.S. Middle East policy, consider me unimpressed.Read Post | Comments (192)Howard Fineman, 10/09/12Editorial Director, Huffington Post Media GroupAfter last week\u0027s disastrous debate performance, Democrats in and around the president\u0027s camp are privately pointing fingers at each other for Obama\u0027s failure in Round One in Denver.Read Post | Comments (1,071)Dan Treadway, 10/09/12Associate blog editor, The Huffington PostThe underlying message dictating that there\u0027s something bizarre about a man capably and willingly taking care of his child is at best a dumb commentary and at worst a harmful one.Read Post | Comments (23)Alicia Keys, 10/09/12Singer, songwriter, AIDS activist, philanthropistModern-day slavery is real. Whether it\u0027s sex trafficking or labor trafficking, in which people are being made to work brutally long hours with no pay, it\u0027s happening right in our backyards and it\u0027s heartbreaking.Read Post | CommentsSeth Shostak, 10/08/12Senior Astronomer, SETI InstituteIt\u0027s enough to make you alternately laugh and cry.

Is it the woman who transforms herself, gets into shape and loses weight? Or the one who rebels, avoids the fuss and doesn\u0027t care? Is it the aging woman who has the courage to admit to cosmetic surgery or the one who resists?Read Post | CommentsBernard-Henri Lévy, 10/09/12French philosopher and writerThe American presidential contest, as Tocqueville demonstrated and one can never be reminded enough, is a bizarre election in which voting takes place state by state, thus not completely on a national scale of the United States.Read Post | Comments (33)Gordon Brown, 10/09/12Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationOur guarantee on International Day of The Girl Child is that we will do everything, everywhere to ensure that the millions of girls who have not gone to school today will get their chance of an education and have their basic human rights respected.Read Post | Comments (55)Muhammad Yunus, 10/09/12Nobel Peace Prize Winner, Founder of Grameen BankIn addition to expanding the global dialogue, we also need to expand access to technologies -- giving more people the tools that will help them shape their own destinies.

After all, the problem for America is that it intervenes around the world too much, not too little.Read Post | Comments (13)Dr. Michael J. Breus, 10/09/12Clinical Psychologist; Board Certified Sleep SpecialistResearchers found that opting to delay bedtime in favor of studying was linked to an increased risk of both types of academic difficulty.

We welcome him back not as a comedian whose material has gotten better with age -- or one recovering from a period of decline -- but as we would a 90s time capsule.Read Post | Comments (310)John Tirman, 10/08/12Executive Director, MIT Center for International StudiesRomney\u0027s foibles as a foreign policy candidate are plentiful and easy targets. Obama\u0027s record is fairly solid and has many genuine achievements. But chances are strong that the next debate will again be \"won\" by Romney -- if Obama retreats to defensive mode.Read Post | Comments (157)Sarena Dharshi, 2012. 9.10Anna Claeys, 2012. 9.10Caroline Davey, 2012. 9.10Nicky Gavron, 2012. 9.10Simon Barnes, 2012. 9.10Heidi Eldridge, 2012. 9.10Toby Stuart, 2012. 9.10Henry C.H.
