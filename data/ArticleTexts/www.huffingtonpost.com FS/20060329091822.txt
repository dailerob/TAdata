{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AP/Eric GayFrom wfmynews2.comFrom americanpatrol.comYesterday, hoping to take advantage of George Bush\u0027s current question-answering state of mind, I put forth 20 questions about Iraq for him. Today I have 20 more questions about everything but Iraq: 1.) Is the limit of your imagination replacing Andy Card with Josh Bolten? 2.) Abramoff, DeLay, Libby, Frist, Santorum, Safavian, and Claude Allen -- if this is what integrity looks like, can you blame those who\u0027d like to bring back Oval Office blow jobs?READ POST | comments (58)03.29.2006 Robert ScheerThroughout the history of this country, anti-immigrant hysteria periodically reigns during low ebbs in our national sense of security and vision.READ POST | comments (13)03.29.2006 Scott BurnsDo we need the President to stop it?
