{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week brought two high-profile examples of what has become the president\u0027s trademark approach to leadership -- \"the fierce urgency of sometime later\" -- as he kicked the proverbial can down the road on Afghanistan and gay marriage. On the former, his limited drawdown plan was derided as \"cautious\" -- not by anti-war activists, but by a GOP presidential candidate (Jon Huntsman). More evidence that opposition to our near-ten-year incursion there has moved way beyond left and right. On the latter, Obama once again stuck with his half-step positioning, refusing to endorse the then-still-pending New York bill on same-sex marriage while lauding the fight for \"change that is lasting\" -- a stance that continues to place him to the right of Dick Cheney. In both cases, the president is standing on the wrong side of history -- trailing behind the growing consensus of those he presumes to lead.Read Post | CommentsDan Collins, 06.24.2011New York Editor-At-Large of The Huffington PostGood Lord, how often is it the New York state legislature makes you proud? The GOP-controlled Senate approved gay marriage.Read Post | CommentsHoward Fineman, 06.22.2011Editorial Director, AOL Huffington Post Media GroupSome people don\u0027t want to admit it, but Washington, DC is America, too. There are many ways to prove that proposition. For example, we have Little League teams, Fourth of July neighborhood parades and our own weird kind of hot dog called a \"half smoke.\"Read Post | CommentsArianna Huffington, 06.20.2011We know that it\u0027s easier to start a war than to finish one -- and we are seeing a case study of this in Afghanistan despite the fact that there\u0027s a clear, widespread, and growing consensus on the value of us getting out.Read Post | CommentsChely Wright, 06.24.2011Country Music Artist, Gay-Rights ActivistThe very root of who I am and the core of what Country Music seems to be about is honesty, openness and accessibility.

Haass, 06.23.2011President, Council on Foreign RelationsThe president just announced that \"it is time to focus on nation-building at home.\" He is right. This is a strategic investment in our future competitiveness and capacity to lead; it is not isolationist.Read Post | CommentsEvan Wolfson, 06.25.2011President, Freedom to Marry; author, \u0027Why Marriage Matters\u0027Having New York end marriage discrimination is a turning point for the country. As New Yorkers say, if we can make it here, we\u0027ll make it anywhere -- but only if the ever-expanding community of people who support the freedom to marry do the work to bring it home nationwide.Read Post | CommentsJanet Tavakoli, 06.24.2011President, Tavakoli Structured FinanceAmerica\u0027s biggest problem by far is that capital spending in new production facilities that create jobs and real products never occurred, not even after trillions of dollars were thrown at banks in the global financial system.Read Post | CommentsRussell Simmons, 06.23.2011Founder of GlobalGrind.comFox News has always been a network that we assume to be evil.

Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law at the University of ChicagoThe most vehement opponent of marriage equality in New York was the Catholic Church. That the leaders of the Church take this position is certainly their right, but it is a sorry testament to their understanding of their Church\u0027s own history in this nation.Read Post | CommentsAl Franken, 06.23.2011U.S. Senator, MinnesotaMedicare, and Medicaid, and investment in infrastructure, and public education, and workers\u0027 rights, and civil rights, -- these aren\u0027t just good progressive ideas, they\u0027re examples of traditional American values.Read Post | CommentsSen. Kirsten Gillibrand, 06.25.2011U.S. Senator from New YorkLast night\u0027s vote for marriage equality in N.Y. was a true bipartisan effort, with Democratic and Republican state senators coming together to support the simple proposition that every New Yorker should be able to marry the person they love. But our work is not done.Read Post | CommentsLenora M. Lapidus, 06.20.2011Director, ACLU Women’s Rights ProjectThe court discounted evidence, emphasized in Justice Ginsburg\u0027s partial dissent, that women were paid less than men in every Wal-Mart region.
