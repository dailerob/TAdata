{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Hart International, Ltd.Many thoughtful commentators have concluded that America has reached a kind of plateau at home and abroad and that other nations will soon rival us in the category we hold most dear: opportunity. When and if that happens, it may occur to us that our greatest promise is not in the realm of material wealth. Our greatest promise is in the unique principles and structures of government bequeathed to us more than two centuries ago.

Daughters, Fathers, and the Changing American Family\u0027A gay man can grin and say ironically, \"I\u0027m a really good mother,\" which may mean that he performs the daily child care in his home, but his comment does not define him as a mom. Nor is a lesbian who coaches her son\u0027s hockey team a father. Both are just doing what parents do.Read Post | Comments (148)Michelangelo Signorile, 04/06/12Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay Voices; SiriusXM radio hostObama\u0027s closet on gay marriage is about as well-guarded as Liberace\u0027s was on being gay. And it\u0027s time for Obama to now kick down the closet door. It\u0027s no longer a matter of whether he can or should. He must if he wants to win the election.Read Post | Comments (247)Inimai Chettiar, 04/06/12Advocacy \u0026 Policy Counsel, ACLUOn Monday, a divided Supreme Court ruled in Florence v.
