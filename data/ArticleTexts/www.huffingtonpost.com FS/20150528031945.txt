{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, National Iranian American CouncilAcademic and 28-year veteran of the Central Intelligence AgencyArguments against the pending nuclear deal with Iran -- from claiming that the deal is a capitulation to Iran to the notion that it is unacceptable to make a deal with a regime like that in Tehran -- have not sufficiently resonated with the public to kill the agreement. This has caused some disarray in the opposition camp. Indeed, if you are in that camp right now, it is reasonable to expect that the search is not for a new argument but for a game changing development: an event so powerful it shifts the momentum in Congress back to AIPAC, Netanyahu, Saudi Arabia and the other opponents of a nuclear deal. Arguably, a military confrontation between Israel and Hezbollah this summer could fit that bill.I want our generation to be the last one to grow up knowing structural and cultural barriers that hold women back. I want our daughters and sons to be able to choose the same college courses and pursue the same careers -- for the same pay.Chief Operating Officer, FacebookI can understand that Rubio doesn\u0027t like to be labeled a homophobe or a hater; but when I hear his and others\u0027 repeated opposition to my marriage to my husband and the family we have created with our son, it feels like a direct attack on who I am and the ones whom I love most.Executive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostWe have to demand an end to corporate welfare. No more handouts to particular corporations and industries simply because they\u0027re big enough and powerful enough to get them. No more specialized tax breaks. No more exemptions or special treatment. No more crony capitalism.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027For the last quarter of a century, NAN and I have advocated on behalf of many victims of racial violence at the hands of police. But in all those years, I\u0027ve never seen a situation that will force a national election to deal with policing as I do now. Translation: GOP candidates will actually have to deal with policing as an issue.President, National Action NetworkThe fact that Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio can say with a straight face that W. and Cheney and Rummy and Condi were innocent dupes of an \"intelligence failure,\" and that the corporate media will blandly repeat these lies, points to a deep failure in our political discourse.Professor, historian, authorA dozen years before his recent sentencing to a 42-month prison term based, former CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling was in the midst of a protracted and fruitless effort to find someone in Congress willing to look into his accusations about racial discrimination at the agency.Author, \u0027War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death\u0027In the United States, women in the House of Representatives didn\u0027t get a bathroom near the Speaker\u0027s Lobby until 2011. It matters that the vast majority of architects, engineers, construction workers and legislators are not affected by this problem.Feminist, writer, and satirist (not always in that order)I was born behind barbed wire 70 years ago in a maximum-security prison camp for Japanese-Americans in Northern California. My visit with mothers and children at the euphemistically named Karnes County \"Residential Center\" a few weeks ago triggered distressing associations of my own experience as a child. We too lived in a constant state of fear and anxiety, never knowing what our fate would be.Psychotherapist, ProducerIt seems so harmless to attach a location with a single message, but the problem is over time the information from these messages adds up. You can see for yourself the potentially invasive usage of the information you share, and decide for yourself if this is something you should worry about.Student, technologist and engineerI\u0027m sure I\u0027m not the first male panelist to give up my seat and try to inject some gender diversity into a conference panel, but we still have a long way to go. Miranda rightly asked the question that many were asking, and she also had the confidence to come forward when I asked her to join the panel -- and I am so glad she did.Global Managing Partner, IBM Social ConsultingPeople who do pay attention to details are the ones who you can trust to stand by your side and weather the storm. So what are some examples of these smaller romantic acts that, in reality, speak volumes?Public Speaker and WriterThe idea was to prevent chaos. Instead, efforts to control this season\u0027s Republican presidential primary debates have injected greater uncertainty into an already volatile process. With somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 candidates jockeying for position, the upcoming series of jousts is already beginning to resemble a survival-of-the-fittest reality show.Professor of Journalism, Northeastern University, BostonToday, we celebrate your bleak future, where you will be forced to make your own decisions, cook your own food and fold your own laundry. The medical bills you incur will now be sent in your name, and the monthly rent check will emerge from your pocket.Amy is a mother of five who writes about family, life, and education.It\u0027s great that the White House and congressional Democrats are out there now calling for $12 an hour. But national Democrats failed to get out in front of the issue of a living wage when they had the chance. They missed a perfect opportunity to show Americans which party not only fights for them, but delivers for them.Author of \u0027Obama’s America: A Transformative Vision of Our National Identity\u0027My mom died of brain cancer when I was in high school, 20 years ago now. And for many years, I missed her vividly. With time, the rawness of her loss faded. Because I lost her so young, I find that I don\u0027t miss her as much because of the experiences we shared or the conversations we had. I miss her for those we didn\u0027t.Writer, lawyer and mom of three living in Portland, OregonFor anyone who remembers the killing fields of Kigali and Butare, it sounds a new and intolerable knell.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.Among teens ages 15 to 19, pregnancies (about 85 percent of which are unplanned) and births are at their lowest rates ever. The teen pregnancy rate has dropped 51 percent since 1990, and the teen birth rate 57 percent since 1991. But teens\u0027 older, unmarried sisters, ages 20 to 29, cannot say the same thing.Pulitzer Prize-winning journalistAccording to experts, approximately one-third of the world\u0027s remaining oil and natural gas reserves are to be found in the Arctic. There needs to be a balance between protecting the Arctic environment and the need for resource development and management. The joint pursuit of responsible Arctic stewardship is necessary.Ambassador of Norway to the United StatesAmbassador of Iceland to the United StatesAmbassador of Finland to the United StatesAmbassador of Sweden to the United StatesAmbassador of Denmark to the United StatesOur focus, then, should not be on trying to \"figure it all out.\" It should be on finding ways to be more accepting of the place we are currently in -- and looking for lessons that we can call upon for guidance in the future.Senior Associate at STARKMAN, Senior Content Manager at Treehouse Technology Group \u0026 blogger at AllThingsGood.coRomero was a man who was at once utterly orthodox and yet utterly radical. That is the model Pope Francis seems to be setting for himself.Visiting Professor in Public Ethics, University of Chester; Senior Research Fellow, Brooks World Poverty Institute, University of ManchesterHere are the six tips of what you can do to get yourself out of the habit of internalizing negative thought patterns. So that you can easily let go off negative thoughts whenever they hit you and feel happy again.Founder of The Happiness Planner. Check out her blog at BrandMentalist.comHarper\u0027s success in the face of so much pressure is an impressive accomplishment, but it is also part of a broader trend where top draft picks are now more likely than ever, injury notwithstanding, to become impact players.lincolnmitchell.comUsing sample dates August 18 through 21, we searched the globe for hotels that have rates at just $100/night this summer. Suddenly, that trip to New York City looks much less appealing. But you\u0027ll be shocked by how gorgeous a resort you can score for just $100 in Phuket!Oyster.com visits, photographs, reviews, and rates each hotel, uncovering the truth before it\u0027s \"uh-oh\" timeI have been a member of a popular online dating service for a little over a year now, and I have to say that, overall, I\u0027m pleasantly surprised by the quality of men I\u0027ve met online. Yet despite my generally positive experiences, I have come across a few (hundred) profiles that completely baffle me.Author, blogger, consultant (\u0026 single mom)There may have been more than 100 bikers at Twin Peaks, all of whom believed they were \u0027good guys\u0027 who needed to carry guns in case a \u0027bad guy\u0027 from another gang was also armed.Mike the Gun GuyCleaning up the oil spilling into the ocean by Santa Barbara will cost much more than preventing the leak would have cost. But of course, preventing the leak would require more \"overreaching by government\" and \"job-killing regulations.\" We pay for this ideological idiocy.Executive Director, Columbia University\u0027s Earth InstituteI was surprised to learn that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said in Shanghai and Seoul that Indian expatriates are ashamed to have been born in India. This doesn\u0027t reflect the reality. What Indians -- everywhere -- have been ashamed of is India\u0027s inept government.Academic, Researcher, Writer, EntrepreneurLately my 6-year-old daughter has become more interested in music. She knows songs on the radio that I don\u0027t even know, lyrics and all. And so, when playing my music on shuffle in the car, I\u0027ve had to be more careful. Like when Snoop Dogg suddenly comes on.Author, blogger at MommyAtoZBlog.comIt\u0027s totally possible to eat a fun and varied diet with just a quick trip to the grocery store and minimal prep-time in the kitchen.pickledplum.comRepublicans risk being caught in a trap of their own devising. The master narrative they\u0027re going with -- dishonesty -- is as dangerous for them as they want it to be for Hillary Clinton. They want the 2016 election to turn on the question \"Can you trust her?\" But Democrats can use jiu-jitsu and make the election turn on the question \"Can you trust the people who duped you into Iraq?\"USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
