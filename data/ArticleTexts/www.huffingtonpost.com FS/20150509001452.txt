{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, National Iranian American CouncilThe regional impact of the world powers and Iran making a deal over Tehran\u0027s nuclear program will be significant to say the least. It will mark a new era in the Middle East; one in which the US and Iran no longer will seek to undermine each other at every given opportunity. In this era of truce, the US and Iran can dialogue about regional problems rather than seeing the absence of diplomacy exacerbate existing conflicts. Yet, in spite of this pending historic achievement, dark years await the Middle East.The question before the court of appeals was whether the collection of this enormous database is \"relevant\" to an \"authorized investigation.\" The problem is that the word \"relevant\" is ambiguous. In the section 215 telephone metadata program, however, the massive amount of information collected is not, at the time it is collected, \"relevant\" to any particular suspected terrorist or suspected terrorist plot.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoIf prevention were a national priority, how would our lives change? That question is followed by another one, which is: What will happen 10 years from now in terms of the health of Americans? Will the year 2025 find Americans stronger, healthier and living longer?Board-certified radiologist; Board member, Lesscancer; Author, \u0027A World Without Cancer\u0027This dark vision for the future will be our own fault if we allow the attack on journalism around the world to go unchecked for another decade, if we continue to look the other way and ignore how killing the messenger erodes democracy and threatens a free, open society.Founder and Executive Director of The GroundTruth Project, Co-founder of GlobalPostIt\u0027s been 10 years since The Huffington Post was born, on May 9, 2005. We\u0027ve done a lot of reminiscing during our anniversary week, but our real focus is on looking ahead. That\u0027s why the theme for our 10-year anniversary is \"The Next 10.\"No one should have to choose between providing for your family and being a good parent. Yet \"family-friendly\" work is still a pipe dream.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Of the many things that have touched me about the response to my memoir Wild, the fact that so many people who\u0027ve had and survived lung cancer or loved someone who died of the disease see themselves in my story is among the most meaningful.Author, \"Wild\"BOGOT¡ -- Our human habitat today is not just a little bit wrong. It is very wrong. Hopefully, future cities will be more effective in making all citizens feel equal and included.Former mayor, Bogot·When\u0027s the last time you asked \"What\u0027s behind the curtain?\" When did we become unable to ask tough questions? That\u0027s kind of the job of an informed electorate at least the way I learned civics.Systemic Risk and Global Stability Observer; Architect of Risk Measurement Systems\"As the oldest in my family, I had the privilege of watching my mom raise my four brothers and sisters, work full-time as a teacher,and earn a graduate degree. Her tireless example taught me the value of hard work.\"CoFounder and President of PowerToFly.comWe need to move beyond the \"flags and footprints\" missions and travel to space with the intent to stay, and Mars is our best bet. The good news is that the majority of the obstacles are economic, rather than engineering. The bad news is that it\u0027s a tough business case to close.Business Development Specialist for Masten Space Systems, Media Specialist for the Commercial Spaceflight FederationThe future of Islam depends on Muslims deciding whether we will be fueled by examples of hope or examples of hatred.Executive Director and Chaplain, Islamic Center at New York UniversityWe are living in the midst of a global fight for child survival. It\u0027s one that I believe we can win--and the work we do over the next 10 years will be critical to our success.President and CEO of the U.S. Fund for UNICEFWhen asked about President Obama\u0027s comments on the need for GCC states to meet their internal challenges with political reforms, featured speaker United Arab Emirates (UAE) ambassador Yousef al-Otaiba was dismissive. \"We do not share your democratic values,\" he stated bluntly.International Policy Adviser for Human Rights FirstTen years from now, the world will be smack in the middle of a historic transition in the relationship between car and driver, as robotic operating systems increasingly take charge of monitoring the roadway, executing lane changes, controlling steering and braking, sharing data with nearby vehicles and surrounding infrastructure, and -- above all -- avoiding crashes.Associate Dean, Harvard School of Public HealthIf all goes as planned, sometime today the World Health Organization will officially declare Liberia to be free at last of the deadly Ebola virus, having passed through the requisite 42-day window without a single new case of the disease.Assistant Professor of Emergency Medicine, Brown Medical SchoolFor all of us over here in Europe, this seems like our weakest, loneliest moment. But it is high time for Europe to grow up, and as everybody knows, there\u0027s no better way to force someone to grow than to inflict a little suffering on them.L\u0027Huffington Post Editorial DirectorWe\u0027re too focused on questions at the margins -- death versus abortion, rape, and incest or abortion under all circumstances or no circumstances. These questions do little to illuminate the reality of most women\u0027s lives and the range of feelings people have about abortions that happen in the real world.Director of the ACLUís Reproductive Freedom Project.Wall Street cannot be an island onto itself and we need to break up those largest banks to put the focus back on working class Americans.Independent U.S. Senator from VermontSome 12.2 million people, more than half of the population, are estimated to need humanitarian assistance. A similar number have been displaced -- between 6.5 million and 7.8 million -- within Syria, and three to four million have been displaced on to neighboring states.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteNEW YORK -- A decade from now, the hearts of some of our largest cities will no longer be defined by gleaming skyscrapers surrounded by well-manicured corporate plazas. The city will regain its human scale and emerge once again as a series of communities -- completing a fascinating journey back to the future.Milstein Professor of Urban Development, Columbia UniversityThe next decade is decisive because trajectory counts for so much; if we bend it now, we may slide the car to a halt with just the front tires hanging off the cliff. But if we sail on for a few more years, it\u0027s pretty clear we\u0027re fast and furiously going airborne -- that\u0027s what happens when, say, Arctic permafrost starts to melt in earnest, releasing clouds of methane.Author of a dozen books, including \u0027The End of Nature\u0027 and \u0027Deep Economy\u0027I want my children, Max and Summer, to always appreciate what they have, but also to understand they have a role in helping our fellow citizens around the world to the basic need of food. I\u0027d love for them to stumble upon this article and other hunger relief stories a decade from now and see that there is an end to world hunger.Performer, mom and global hunger relief advocateHow about we pause, put down our devices, look up and listen to our hearts and our consciences? Not so much \u0027connectivity\u0027 as just connecting with each other. And if that moral progress could keep pace with technological progress then that would be, well, real progress.Hashemite Kingdom of JordanThe state of race, culture and religion in America is a key metric for how we are evolving as a society. The question for the church in 2025 is do we have enough elasticity and self-awareness to accommodate other customs, and views different from our own?Senior Pastor, Potter\u0027s House, TexasToday, following decades of environmental action, I\u0027m proud to advocate for federal climate legislation and support President Obama\u0027s efforts to act on climate knowing that the evidence is in: Smart environmental standards boost innovation and strengthen our economy.Dean of the US House of Representatives | Ranking Member, House Judiciary CommitteeThis new movement for free higher education is therefore a very welcome, and very American, development.
