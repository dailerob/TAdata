{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThe SNAP roles did what they were supposed to do: they ramped up in the Great Recession to meet the nutritional needs of low-income families. As the economy slowly recovers -- especially slowly from the perspective of the poor -- they\u0027re ramping back down again. It\u0027s called countercyclical safety net policy, and conservatives gunning for the program -- the House Republicans want to administer huge cuts that would throw almost four million off the rolls in in 2014 and an average of 3 million people each year over the next decade -- are willfully ignoring the program\u0027s effectiveness. If I may be permitted -- and I\u0027m bragging on my friends, not me -- we at CBPP make a lot of revealing graphs. But I\u0027ve chosen the ones that I think shine the brightest light on the path back to smart fiscal and economic policy.Comments (19)TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"At first glance, a choir may seem like nothing more than a group of singers.

MillerHumoristSay you arrive one day for an important job interview, but find there\u0027s no job, no interviewer and no office.

He was happy, and so was I. Because while too many people questioned my young son\u0027s preferences, and therefore my skills as a mother, we both stood strong with a cartoon rabbit who carried an anvil in his pink purse.Comments (43)Bob CescaManaging Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowActivists like Snowden want you to believe that NSA is directly, and without court approval, spying on you personally, because hyperbole like this feeds an agenda that involves scaring anyone susceptible to anti-government paranoia.CommentsAdam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; co-founder of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911The day after Christmas means a lot of different things to a lot of different people - obligatory gift returns, post-Christmas sales, pouring the last of the eggnog in your coffee, an end to holiday music in public spaces and on public airwaves.CommentsMarian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundMost Americans are wrapping up their holiday celebrations and pondering the promise of 2014.

We humans never sing alone.CommentsBruce AckermanProfessor of law and political science, Yale; Author \u0027The Decline and Fall of the American Republic\u0027President Obama should not allow the NSA to convince him that his reform program is merely an idealistic wishlist that ignores the endless threats of the 21st century. He should treat the reform initiative as the constitutional minimum required to keep the high-tech dynamo from spinning entirely out of control.CommentsPadmini ParthasarathyJournalist based in New York, NYI was raised an American Hindu who feels more nostalgia for December pine in New York than October sulfur in Mumbai. I didn\u0027t think I would see a Christmas tree this year. And this one was startlingly alive, outside, swaying between private mourning and public celebration.CommentsChez PazienzaCo-host, \u0027The Bubble Genius Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027; writer, Deus Ex MalcontentMaybe the tools of quickfire social media outrage really do ensure that the guilty no longer go unpunished for their crimes.

We know that a handful of voter fraud cases have been used to silence millions of voices and we must change that.Comments (110)Rob KallHost, Bottom-up Radio Show WNJC 1360, publisher, OpEdNews.com and Futurehealth.orgTwo years later, technology had not come to the rescue, so Whitacre embraced the technological challenge and came up with a creative, artistic solution. I love the idea of embracing the variation by weaving it into the art rather than \"fixing\" the problem.CommentsBob BurnettBerkeley writer, retired Silicon Valley executiveIn 2013 there was a resurgence of populism in the U.S., with the enormous popularity of Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and the victory of Bill de Blasio in the New York mayor\u0027s race.
