We\u0027re five years into a so-called recovery that\u0027s been a bonanza for the rich but a bust for the middle class. \"The game is rigged and the American people know that. They get it right down to their toes,\" says Senator Elizabeth Warren. Which is fueling a new populism on both the left and the right. While still far apart, neo-populists on both sides are bending toward one another and against the establishment. And it\u0027s not only the rhetoric that\u0027s converging. Populists on the right and left are also coming together around core principles.We can only get married because millions of people took a stand to defend and protect us. The gay people of Brunei -- and Russia, and Uganda, and many other countries -- need us to take another stand today.Elton JohnDavid FurnishIt seems that the more students, teachers, and families express concern about Common Core and high-stakes testing, the more its proponents rush to defend the indefensible with unsubstantiated claims for their wonderfulness.Alan SingerSocial studies educator, Hofstra UniversityWe\u0027ve accomplished storytelling on the silver screen and the latest Internet meme, but is the art of storytelling dead when it comes to complicated, politically charged issues like our environment and the need for swift action to combat climate change?Robert RedfordActor, director and environmental activistMarie is part of the \"college girls\" category, but this is as far as the truth stretches; the picture beside her sex chat persona is a voluptuous, sultry brunette. The reality is a petite and softly-spoken blonde who seems as far removed from an insatiable, risque vixen as you can get.Ella JamesonFreelance writerIn order for us to see real progress on climate change, our politicians need be just as embarrassed to stand next to the CEO of ExxonMobil as they would be to stand with the head of Philip Morris.Jamie HennCo-founder and Communications Director, 350.orgEvery Imam who takes the pulpit this Friday should at the very least pray for our sisters in Nigeria as well as every woman who faces religious persecution and oppression at the hands of those who claim to act on God\u0027s behalf.Imam Khalid LatifExecutive Director and Chaplain, Islamic Center at New York UniversityI spent MANY years hating and hiding a body I was ashamed of because it wasn\u0027t society\u0027s ideal of beautiful. Being asked to send a photo of myself with a shirt on made me feel like I again should be ashamed of my body.Brooke BirminghamHealthy lifestyle bloggerI\u0027m not just a \"paralyzed bride.\" I\u0027m Rachelle, a regular girl who had everything going for her when it all came crashing down. And my dear friend, who had only innocent intentions, is not just the girl who pushed me.Rachelle FriedmanBlogger; speaker; ambassador for the spinal cord injury communityWhen I think about my mom, I wonder what a difference these relationships with a variety of other women across the globe might have made in her life. In our lives, too, my brothers\u0027 and sister\u0027s and mine. I know that it\u0027s had an immeasurably positive impact on my life.Meagan FrancisMeagan Francis, TheHappiestHome.comI\u0027ve become accustomed to the looks of disbelief from people who didn\u0027t know I was homeless or that I had a mini stroke while homeless.Carey FullerHomeless motherWhen Pensacola, Florida, gets two feet of rain in 26 hours, that is exactly the kind of extreme and destructive event that scientists have long warned will become way more common.Al GoreChairman, Generation Investment Management and The Climate Reality ProjectWhen you spend four years researching a book on dogs and cats, you learn some surprising things.David GrimmAward-winning journalist, teacher, and book authorDon\u0027t say I didn\u0027t warn you what a Supreme Court led by a Chief Justice John Roberts would be like on separation of church and state. In 2005, I was invited to be an expert witness in the Judiciary Committee\u0027s confirmation hearings on John Roberts appointment to be Chief Justice.Rev. Dr. Susan Brooks ThistlethwaiteProfessor of Theology, Chicago Theological SeminaryYet, while its role regionally and globally may never have been greater, recent events -- most notably the abduction of more than 200 schoolgirls by the Islamist armed group Boko -- show that Nigeria faces a serious domestic test of its stability which also threatens regional peace and security.Salil ShettyYour phone\u0027s camera can also be a practical tool. I use my smartphone camera for all sorts of things that no one would ever consider a \"Kodak moment.\"Larry MagidTechnology journalistRewarding Brunei, the first East Asian nation to follow in the footsteps of Taliban-era Afghanistan by stoning gays to death, will send a grotesque message to the world.Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesYes, Secretary Shinseki does owe us an explanation. But he owes it after a thorough investigation of these serious allegations is able to determine exactly what happened. Shinseki has stated that if the investigation substantiates allegations of employee misconduct, swift and appropriate action will be taken.Jon SoltzCo-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranThere are so many gay men who treat other gay men with love and respect. I definitely want to acknowledge that. But we, as individual gay men, can make our lives and lives of other gay men even richer, pleasant, and vibrant by choosing our words wisely and speaking from the heart.Josh HershLife coach and entrepreneurIt\u0027s both the best of times and the worst of times for the free speech rights the network is supposed to support. To break the cycle of repression we must look more closely at the tools protesters and reporters use and ask whether they further the cause of freedom, or just make speakers more vulnerable.Timothy KarrSenior Director of Strategy, Free PressI believe you can change the world through sex. My team and I are working to make sex better for all of us and to provide a healthy, real-world counterpoint to the ubiquitous influence of porn. The world of business and tech is doing everything it possibly can to stop us.Cindy GallopFounder, IfWeRanTheWorld.comWhat do we mean by \"appreciation\" when we talk about our nation\u0027s teachers? How do we appreciate those who give so much of themselves while constantly hearing the fabricated refrain of public school failure?Jason EndacottAssistant Professor of Social Studies, University of Arkansas; Blogger, EduSanityIn theory, U.S. law protects even prisoners. A combination of a \"get-tough\" attitude coupled with ignorance of medical issues can result in tragedy, in which the prisoner has no redress.Rabbi Shmuly YanklowitzEducator, activist and writerIngraham\u0027s idea is a dud all the way around. Not only that, it runs counter to what most Americans want: a solution to our country\u0027s broken immigration solution. Ingraham\u0027s pledge is remarkable only for being pathetic and pointless.Raul A. ReyesAttorney; USA Today Columnist, NBC News ContributorI turn to face the truth -- that my baby girl is gone and it hurts like hell rolled over on me. I open my empty arms, throwing them around the pain, embracing the suffering, and scream out, \"I don\u0027t want to be numb -- I want to FEEL EVERYTHING.\"Christa BlackBlogger, Speaker, SongwriterBy some estimates, one in four Americans suffers from a diagnosable mental illness. Yet conversations on mental illness are uncommon. That was until last year, when a schizophrenic man disembarked from a Greyhound bus in Sacramento, California.Dan RatherHost, \u0027Dan Rather Presents\u0027In working with veterans for the past five years, I have learned a lot about their lives, thoughts, feelings, actions, intentions and outcomes. These learnings have reshaped the way I look at homeless veterans, myself and my community.Nick Holt, MSW, ASWMental health professional in Los AngelesThe photographer was not used to kids like me. The ones in wheelchairs, the ones who couldn\u0027t sit up straight.Natalie E. Illumpoet, activist and storyteller living in Washington, DCIndeed, our families lived through many of the same horrors and transformations. And I agree -- we do not need to apologize for our origins. Nothing about this notion, however, justifies blindness to inequality.Daniel GastfriendDaniel Gastfriend graduated from Princeton in 2013 with a degree from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. He currently works for IDinsight in Uganda, where he helps governments and development organizations use rigorous evidence to improve their social impact.Scientists at Penn State have been studying effort -- when and why we either spend or conserve our energy. They set out to confirm the intuitive notion that we don\u0027t use any more effort than we must in our routine daily actions.Wray HerbertAuthor, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027A mental health worker who alerts the police to a patient\u0027s suicide plan with a gun isn\u0027t infringing on anyone\u0027s 2nd Amendment rights. And an ER physician who\u0027s told by a patient that \"I\u0027m not going to let him beat me up again\" has a Hippocratic responsibility to inquire about the existence of a gun.Mike WeisserMike the Gun GuyGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"BENGHAZI CHAIR: DON\u0027T FUNDRAISE OFF BENGHAZI...
