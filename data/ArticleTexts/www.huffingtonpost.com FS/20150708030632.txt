{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Director, Earth Institute at Columbia UniversityNo country -- including Greece -- should expect to be offered debt relief on a silver platter; relief must be earned and justified by real reforms that restore growth, to the benefit of both debtor and creditor. And yet, a corpse cannot carry out reforms. That is why debt relief and reforms must be offered together, not reforms \"first\" with some vague promises that debt relief will come in some unspecified amount at some unspecified time in the future (as some in Europe have said to Greece). With both sides at fault, it is important for them not to lose the future by squabbling endlessly over the past.Research has found that privileged kids are, as a whole, more self-centered, depressed, and self-destructive. They\u0027re more narcissistic, but struggle to develop a sense of self. And yet, they excel, often quite notably, in academics, sports, and other pursuits. So what we have is a generation of paradox: Bright, talented, increasingly troubled children.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarFirst there were some odd reports of a \"power surge\"; then came the slow understanding of the scale of events -- and the news of the bus that was carrying Miriam. I remember the blankness on the faces of the crowds, people milling around -- not sure whether to stay and work out what was happening, or whether to try to continue to get to work. Today we remember those London commuters, Miriam and rest of the 52 who died.Mayor of LondonPeople\u0027s lives are circling the drain, and nobody\u0027s even talking about it, much less doing something about it.

The muddling is over with and the path ahead is clear for all to see.Chairman, Berggruen InstituteEditor-in-chief, THEWORLDPOSTWe are all a product of our upbringing, and Bristol grew up a fundamentalist Christian in a patriarchal society, the daughter of a highly visible Republican.

Imagine if our collective stories can change history?Director of Public Affairs, Define AmericanWomen and minorities have secured some rights that are here to stay -- different for each group -- while other rights are still elusive or being stripped away. There is always a backlash to equality, and it could last a very long time, as bigotry doesn\u0027t die easily. Like every group, LGBT people have to remain vigilant.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostThere\u0027s just one legal aid lawyer for every 8,893 low-income Americans who qualify for legal aid.

But how will the European governments deal with their own fears? Specifically, how will they react to the possible light-speed contagion of Syriza\u0027s rebelliousness in Spain, Portugal and Italy?Editorial Director, El Huffington PostI fear that all of the attention on the flag provides cover to politicians who want to ignore the larger problem. Some of the same politicians talking about bringing down the flag are doing so to avoid talking about the proliferation of guns.Professor, Author, Columnist, and Commentator at MichaelFauntroy.com.Despite coming at the end of the fourth of July weekend when many families are traveling, the overnight TV ratings for the championship match hit 15.2.
