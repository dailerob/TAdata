{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOSince their thumpin\u0027 last week, the far-right has pushed the crazy to eleven and snapped the knob clean off -- an opening salvo of twisted hackery portending an insane four-to-eight years of attacks on the Obama administration. If the last seven days have been any indication, the far-right is shaping up to make the 1990s seem quaint -- even erudite by comparison. That which used to be your basic, off-the-shelf intellectual dishonesty has grown into, as Digby pointed out last week, full-on intellectual violence.Read Post | CommentsBIOAlan Patricof, 11.12.2008After Obama\u0027s win, in Kenya, unlike when I last visited, there no heavy debates, but constructive dialogue about America resuming the role of leading the world.Read Post | Comments (12)BIOJane Hamsher, 11.12.2008While it\u0027s one thing for Obama to forgive Lieberman for the gutter tactics that he engaged in on McCain\u0027s behalf, it\u0027s quite another to let the chairmanship of such an important committee serve as an olive branch.Read Post | Comments (88)BIOOmid Memarian, 11.12.2008Obama\u0027s response to Ahmadinejad\u0027s congratulations letter could be the first step toward drawing a new foreign policy framework in order to bring the United States on the right track.Read Post | Comments (18)BIOMark Nickolas, 11.12.2008Case-in-point is today\u0027s Boston Herald story by Dave Wedge on the custom-made armor-laden presidential limo that is being assembled to protect America\u0027s first black president.Read Post | Comments (34)BIODoug Kendall, 11.12.2008Obama must secure \"a new birth of freedom\" for the 21st century, push the Supreme Court to enforce the text and history of the Reconstruction Amendments, and nominate Justices who will do the same.Read Post | CommentsBIOMark Green, 11.12.2008As president, Obama is historically situated to reframe the American conversation around democracy, diplomacy, opportunity and a greener world. What\u0027s more patriotic than the story of progress?Read Post | Comments (13)BIOMuadi Mukenge, 11.12.2008Fresh from a two-week visit to the Democratic Republic of Congo, I watch on television the escalation of war, one that has already claimed five million lives since 1998.Read Post | CommentsBIOSteve Clemons, 11.12.2008Obama should look to Cheney to understand how a pro -- even one who so damaged the interests of the nation -- managed power and purpose in government.Read Post | Comments (103)BIORyan J. Davis, 11.12.2008I\u0027m a little scared of the anti-Mormon fervor that I\u0027m seeing in the gay community. Tonight\u0027s protest will just confirm the Mormons\u0027 fears about us and will certainly be portrayed negatively in the media.Read Post | Comments (87)BIOJacob Heilbrunn, 11.12.2008Serving in Washington would unquestionably polish up Sarah Palin\u0027s resume, allowing her to claim both executive and national experience as well as having weathered the presidential campaign trail in 2008.Read Post | CommentsBIOJoseph A. Palermo, 11.12.2008It\u0027s interesting that at a time when the Republican Party is facing its most bitter internal battles, Nagourney chooses to ignore that story and jumps head first into \"analyzing\" non-existent antagonisms among Democrats.Read Post | CommentsBIOFrank Schaeffer, 11.12.2008Yes, it\u0027s all about the economy. But no one should kid themselves: the culture wars have the potential to sap the energy from your best initiatives.Read Post | Comments (22)BIORobert L. Borosage, 11.11.2008On both values and issues, moderates line up with liberals to form a strong majority that isolates conservatives. Conservatives have had their day. This is a center-left, not a center-right nation.Read Post | Comments (282)BIOAlon Ben-Meir, 11.11.2008For the Obama administration to help orchestrate an Arab-Israeli peace agreement, it must accept the premise that America\u0027s active and direct role is indispensable.Read Post | Comments (52)BIOBill Maher, 11.12.2008Read Post | CommentsBIOMichael Fauntroy, 11.11.2008The Republicans have a bigger problem than they think. Continuing with the same ideological leadership and ignoring the demographic reality facing the country will only make things worse.Read Post | Comments (159)BIOBonnie Fuller, 11.11.2008Michelle Obama didn\u0027t just make a fashion statement, she told the world what kind of First Lady she will be.Read Post | Comments (347)BIOBob Edwards, 11.11.2008I grew up in segregationist Louisville, Kentucky.
