{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Medical Correspondent, CBS Evening News with Scott PelleyAs a physician, I was eager to learn more about the Oregon experience, with special attention to patients, family members, and healthcare professionals involved in such a deeply personal decision. The result became my first \"60 Minutes\" report, which will be broadcast Sunday, March 13 (7:30-8:30 PM, ET/ 7:00-8:00 PM PT) on the CBS Television Network.Trump consistently uses falsehood and hate for his personal and political self-aggrandizement. He deliberately lies and manipulates the sins in our nation for his own self-advantage. This is way beyond politics and partisanship now -- it is a fundamental moral issue. Donald Trump is an evil and dangerous man who is unrepentant about his sins. Media pundits will say that Trump will get away with this again, like he has with his many other inflammatory, racist and dangerous statements, and that his rising constituency will actually like their man speaking this way. Polls say 82 percent of Trump\u0027s supporters support his unconstitutional and morally indefensible proposed ban on Muslims entering the country. So it\u0027s time to denounce the views of those who support these hateful statements from Donald Trump.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersWhen I think of Hillary Clinton offering her eloquent ode yesterday to Nancy Reagan for the late first lady\u0027s supposed \"very effective, low key [AIDS] advocacy,\" I am absolutely furious and I don\u0027t know what to do with myself.Editorial Director, The Huffington Post VoicesThe American people will have a clear choice this November, no matter who the nominees are. The Democrats are united in favoring expanding, not cutting, Social Security. The Republicans stand against expanding, and with the exception of Trump, for deep cuts to Social Security.Founding Co-director, Social Security WorksEarlier today, my friend Nancy Reagan joined her husband in their adjoining gravesites at the Reagan Library. United in death as they had been throughout their long and happy marriage, Nancy and Ronnie were two film actors who played out their lives on a much more exciting world stage than Hollywood.Actor, author of 10 books and a book of poems \"Life Could Be Verse” published by HCI, December 2014For me as a Christian, as a pastor and a seminary professor, I believe what the New Testament teaches, that love is stronger and more enduring. \"And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love. (1 Cor. 13:13) You will not win with hate over love, Mr. Trump. Politics aside, you will not win.Professor of Theology, Chicago Theological SeminaryThe word \"trump,\" according to the dictionary, is an alteration of the word triumph. And because Donald Trump, the US presidential candidate, appears likely to become the nominee of the Grand Old Party of Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan, we owe it to ourselves to ask in what sense and for whom he represents a triumph.French philosopher and writerThe Times has done Israelis, Palestinians, and its readers a disservice.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Republican voters face a bad choice. The Donald\u0027s shortcomings are manifest. Marco Rubio may be young, well-spoken, and attractive. But his foreign policy judgment is awful. If you want more foolish, costly, and unnecessary wars, vote for Rubio.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteAmerica\u0027s Cradle to Prison Pipeline is a toxic cocktail of poverty, illiteracy, racial disparities, violence and massive incarceration which sentences millions of children of color to social and economic death. Once young people have entered, to many they become just a statistic.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundAt a Donald J. Trump campaign event March 9, 2016, my friend Rakeem and I saw what being American is all about. It has been unreal, distressing and nauseating. One of the main thoughts that remains in my head is, What if I didn\u0027t have my camera? Thank God I did.Music producer and musicianWe cannot afford to elect a President with a history bad judgement, inconsistent positions, and who has used public service as a vehicle for private gain. In other words, we cannot afford the status-quo.Co-Founder, Ben \u0026 Jerry\u0027s Ice Cream and Head Stamper, StampStampede.orgBaked, fried, puréed or mashed, everyone loves potatoes. From Maple-Mashed Sweet Potatoes to Potatoes Leek Soup, here are seven simple and delicious ways to make them.Chef, Recipe Developer and Busy MomChanging your habits in the name of greater happiness is one of the best things that you can do for yourself. But it\u0027s also important for another reason--taking control of your happiness makes everyone around you happier too.Author of #1 bestselling book, Emotional Intelligence 2.0, and president of TalentSmart, world\u0027s leading provider of emotional intelligence.The military has long prided itself on being a meritocracy, where those who serve are judged not based on who they are or where they come from, but rather what they have to offer to help defend this country. Today, we take yet another step toward that continued excellence.25th Secretary of the Department of DefenseThere must be a thorough outside investigation into how Perry and other FSU officials-including Jimbo Fisher, the FSU head football coach, and Monk Bonasorte, the Associate Director of athletics-colluded to protect Winston.Filmmaker, \"The Hunting Ground\"With depressing regularity, it keeps happening. A child, sometimes as young as a toddler, gets hold of a firearm (usually owned by a parent or other family member) and unintentionally pulls the trigger with horrific results.Executive Director, Violence Policy CenterTrump\u0027s scapegoating of Muslims, Hispanics, blacks and other \"others\" for political gain is exposing a racist ugliness, and dangerously inflaming it. Who knows how big the fire might get?Senior Editor, Huffington Post CanadaAs my co-worker and I approached, we were not scared when the protesters yelled their misinformed opinions at us. We were emboldened by the blood of my ancestors which fertilized the fields of a nation not yet free for all.Young Philanthropist, Revolutionary, Teacher of Black EntrepreneurshipWithout a muscular pushback from the public, the big airlines could claim the American airspace as their own to tax and regulate, without any significant compensation to the American taxpayer and no oversight from elected officials. Talk about getting skyjacked!Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorThe point that needs to be made and is often missed, when it comes to the utterances from the right-wing crazy train, is that the presidency is a real job and requires the person to fill that job to live in reality.Richard Zombeck is a freelance writer and a podcaster at TandZTalk.com.As the news broke on March 7, 2016, that U.S. drone strikes had killed 150 people in Somalia, the White House announced it will reveal, for the first time, the number of people killed by drones and manned airstrikes \"outside areas of active hostilities\" since 2009. This is a critical first step toward much-needed transparency. But it will not go far enough.Professor, Thomas Jefferson School of LawLet us be as comprehensive in our approach to addiction as it is in taking lives. Every stakeholder, physician, public official and addiction counselor I speak with is thrilled at the momentum and strategy revealed today.Cardiac Surgeon and Host of the Emmy-Award Winning \u0027The Dr. Oz Show\u0027What was supposed to be a family vacation turned into the nightmare of our lives when my father was kidnapped into a mysterious black car on the streets of Dubai. As we waited for the UAE government to sort out my father\u0027s unjust detainment, we realized that dead silence is not the answer.Daughter and human rights activistThe focus of the media was the \"civility\" of this debate compared to previous ones, combined with typical horse race speculations about which candidate won and which lost. Well, I can\u0027t tell you who won, but I can tell you who lost: the American people lost.Writer, Professor, Retired Lt. Colonel, Air ForceBinney spent over 30 years at the National Security Agency as a high-ranked official and left in 2002 after criticizing the agency\u0027s system for collecting data on Americans.Editor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027They Know Everything About You\u0027But once we settle on this axiom -- no god-powers to Donald Trump, ever -- the fact remains that even if he were to become president the world will remain much larger and more inscrutable than someone like Donald Trump (whose truly unhandsome reflection consumes his entire universe) can even fractionally comprehend.Writer. Philosopher. Reluctant Entrepreneur.I have so many things that I want to say to you, more than I can address in this post. While I haven\u0027t personally sat down and talked to Chrissy I\u0027m currently walking in her shoes, (minus the whole supermodel thing) and have a few choice opinions on this subject.Seattle Life and Style BloggerYes, I have Parkinson\u0027s disease and I tried out for American Ninja Warrior. Yes, I would love to be on the show for a multitude of reasons. However, what I\u0027ve learned training to be a ninja has far outweighed the benefits of being on TV.Single Mom, Blogger, Social Media Network Creator, Motivational Speaker, Fitness Enthusiast, Mud Runner, Parkinson\u0027s Patient and OvercomerI can\u0027t speak for them, or for anyone else, but when my sense of the natural order of things left, I acquired the heaviness of grief... and an immense amount of fear. Now that nothing makes sense, I am afraid of everything.Advertising writer, parent and parenting blogger living in Omaha, Nebraska, with her husband and two young daughters.I\u0027ve heard people say cussing is a morality issue. It\u0027s not. Our daughter is a good person. She is responsible at home. She knows swearing does not make a person bad. Being disrespectful and treating others poorly makes them bad. To us, these issues are separate.Writer, MotherGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day. Newsletters may offer personalized content or advertisements.
