After all, besides your mother or spouse, who do you count on to care about your well-being more than your doctor does? That is literally his or her job. But what I\u0027ve found is that the same incentives distorting banking, energy, education, and government are distorting our very bodies. For American health care providers, the goal isn\u0027t to get you healthy, but to get you paying. And similar to banking where the costs of a low interest loan might be a hidden balloon payment, the costs of our health care system are hidden from the end consumer.Read Post | Comments (130)Cecile Richards, 2/1/12President, Planned Parenthood Action FundThe news this week that the Susan G. Komen for the Cure Foundation, after years of pressure from political groups, will end its support of lifesaving breast cancer screening at Planned Parenthood health centers comes as a blow to women across America.Read Post | Comments (12)Bob Edgar, 2/1/12President and CEO, Common CauseThe election is still more than nine months away, but it\u0027s already clear that in the race for the White House, \"we the people\" are running far behind \"we the one percent.\"Read Post | CommentsTrey Ellis, 2/1/12Novelist, Screenwriter, and Associate Professor at Columbia UniversityPresident Gingrich, as soon as Air Force One touched down on my hot, tropical tarmac I shuddered. I knew that I was lost. As the gleaming jet\u0027s door opened and you stood there on the top of the stairs, your ermine robe jauntily draped over your adorably hunched soft shoulders.Read Post | CommentsGov. Jennifer M. Granholm, 2/1/12Former Governor of Michigan, Faculty at UC Berkeley, Host of \"The War Room with Jennifer Granholm\" on Current TVThe president succeeded in keeping plants open and saving jobs; Mitt Romney closed factory after factory and now he wants you to believe that the two are equivalent.Read Post | Comments (20)Michael Roth, 2/1/12President, Wesleyan UniversityI\u0027m embarrassed to say that one of the key places where candidates and citizens acquire a taste for -- and skills in -- negativity is higher education. For decades now, we have promoted a culture of criticism in which you show how smart you are by tearing apart somebody else\u0027s ideas.Read Post | Comments (12)Jared Bernstein, 2/1/12Senior Fellow, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesThough Romney recognized that \"...we have food stamps, we have Medicaid, we have housing vouchers...\" he neglected to make the following four points.Read Post | Comments (30)Laurie David, 2/1/12Producer, author, NRDC TrusteePaula Deen\u0027s problem -- hers and America\u0027s -- won\u0027t be solved with a prescription from the pharmacy. But it can be solved with changes in the way we all cook, and eat.Read Post | Comments (106)Amb. Marc Ginsberg, 2/1/12Former U.S. Ambassador to MoroccoIt\u0027s high time to toss aside diplomatic niceties and place Russia in the diplomatic stockade for its sheltering of the illegitimate Bashar al-Assad from global wrath.Read Post | Comments (18)Al Gore, 2/1/12Chairman, Current TVAcidifying oceans, a result of the same carbon dioxide pollution that is warming our planet, is a problem of multiple dimensions.Read Post | Comments (75)Rep. Steny Hoyer, 2/1/12Keeping children out of poverty in America will take more than just local community efforts. We need national policies that provide more opportunities for low-income families and put more Americans on a pathway out of poverty.Read Post | CommentsEsther Wojcicki, 2/1/12Journalism/English teacherWant to know how we can improve our schools using technology? Want to know how your son/daughter\u0027s education can be more effective?Read Post | CommentsDoug Kendall, 2/1/12Founder and President, Constitutional Accountability CenterWith friends like Senator Mike Lee, the Constitution needs no enemies.Read Post | Comments (118)Linda Bergthold, 2/1/12Health policy consultantIn light of the aggressive attack on women\u0027s health by the Right, perhaps we should ask -- \"Am I a woman or am I a puppet?\" Our strings are being pulled far to the right, and many of us are fed up.Read Post | CommentsDerek Shearer, 2/1/12Professor of Diplomacy at Occidental College and former US ambassadorLA should step up to the global marketing plate and rename our airport after Elizabeth Taylor, one of the great movie actresses of modern times. LAX should become LIZ.Read Post | CommentsAzeem Ibrahim, 2/1/12Research Fellow, Harvard Kennedy School’s International Security ProgramFor the vast majority of the electorate, the economy trumps most other issues. Candidates who continue to raise anti-Muslim fears should be seen as irrelevant distractions from the real problems of the economy, jobs, civil rights, education and health care.Read Post | CommentsTom Ortenberg, 2/1/12CEO, Open Road FilmsThe Grey is a great story and thrilling to watch on the big screen, but that\u0027s all it is. Fiction. Fantasy. Made up.Read Post | CommentsJulianne Moore, 2/1/12ActressValentine\u0027s Day has become a major children\u0027s holiday, and is for them, about friendship. So if we parents have to buy Valentines anyway, why not send the money to children and schools less fortunate than our own?Read Post | Comments (44)Rakim Brooks, 2/1/12Ed Baker Fellow in Democratic Values at Demos and host of \"The People\" on WBAI.org radio 99.5 FM NYThis is the first interview in the Black History Month series \"Perspectives on Black Politics in the Age of Obama.\"Read Post | Comments (271)John Feffer, 1/31/12Co-director, Foreign Policy In FocusIf the house organs of the financial sector and the house intellectuals of the Right are all talking like a Marxist study group, then perhaps we are on the verge of a major transformation -- not only in terminology but, more importantly, in the facts on the ground.Read Post | Comments (152)Mark Shriver, 2/1/12Senior Vice President for Save the Children\u0027s U.S. ProgramsThe solution to childhood poverty takes Herculean efforts, enormous investment and a driving national will, so everyone needs to be a hero. But the place to start is right here: getting off our butts and doing something.Read Post | CommentsMichael P. McDonald, 2/1/12Associate Professor, George Mason UniversityWhat will happen in the general election if Romney is the nominee is anyone\u0027s guess. I suspect that Republican conservatives will line up behind Romney, but they will not do so enthusiastically, as the low voter turnout in contested states thus far shows.Read Post | Comments (47)Abraham H. Foxman, 2/1/12National Director, Anti-Defamation LeagueThe goal would be to temper the Islamicization of society and to ensure a moderate, balanced set of laws that does not ignore Islam but provides spaces for true democratic norms and protections for free speech and minorities.Read Post | Comments (22)Rev.

And at some point I really got that the key to happiness is to going deep inside myself and realizing that I was enough and that is what I call the process of unbinding.Read Post | CommentsMaribel Hastings, 2/1/12Senior Adviser, America\u0027s VoiceBut for some Cuban and Cuban-American voters, the candidates\u0027 immigration positions don\u0027t dim their appeal. Neither does the tone of the debate, which many consider insulting to the whole community.Read Post | Comments (12)Amy Shiner, 2012. 1.02Tom Grasty, 2012. 1.02Meg Wolff, 2012. 1.02Rep.
