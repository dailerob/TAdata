{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Bill Moyers and Michael WinshipIt\u0027s astonishing how ignorant (not to mention crude and cruel) the very rich can be. Surely, one of his well-paid retainers could have reminded Mr. Perkins that Kristallnacht was the opening salvo in Hitler\u0027s extermination of the Jews, the \"night of broken glass\" in 1938 Germany and Austria when nearly a hundred Jews were murdered, 30,000 were sent to concentration camps, and synagogues and Jewish-owned business were looted and destroyed, many of them burned to the ground. If Perkins thought his puny point survived the outrageous exaggeration, he was sadly mistaken.Comments (128)Bob CescaManaging Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowThe congressional Republicans and the conservative entertainment complex has lost its collective shpadoinkle over President Obama\u0027s slate of new executive orders. In fact, George W. Bush signed more orders in his first four years than President Obama has signed in just over five.CommentsBen HallmanSenior Financial Writer, The Huffington PostAn accounting of my spending reveals that when I told my daughter we couldn\u0027t afford the book, what I meant was that I\u0027d rather spend that money on something else. That something, in most instances, is beer.Comments (39)Michael ShawPublisher of the visual politics and media literacy site, BagNewsNotesWith the Winter Olympics about a week away, you can see how Western magazine covers are graphically setting the mood -- as well as the table for more fomentation.CommentsTaylor HirthChildren\u0027s advocate and motherI have composed this sample buget. It accounts for the things that many people expect lower income families to maintain, and maintain without public assistance. It doesn\u0027t account for saving for college for our children, saving for retirement, or saving for much of anything at all.Comments (225)Chad BrownPolk County Democratic Party of Iowa Central CommitteeThe \"Duck Dynasty Wing\" of the Republican Party has taken over the GOP, and they\u0027re not about to retreat in their war on science and common sense.Comments (167)Adi ZarsadiasGlobe trotter and writerDon\u0027t date a girl who travels. She is hard to please. She will be unimpressed with your new car and your expensive watch. She would rather climb a rock or jump out of an airplane than hear you brag about it.CommentsMichael E. MannDirector of Penn State Earth System Science Center; Author of \u0027Dire Predictions\u0027 and \u0027The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars\u0027Although the current temperatures in the eastern U.S. may seem unusually cold, in the context of our history they really aren\u0027t. In fact, most of the cold that has made the news lately hasn\u0027t been all that chilly compared what was \"normal\" for the 20th century.Comments (20)Lina EscoDirector, \u0027Free the Nipple\u0027What is more obscene: violence or a nipple?CommentsRalph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorAfter 94 years, on January 27, 2014, the world lost Pete Seeger. The world is the lesser for that loss. I met and spoke to Pete Seeger a few times and can attest to his steady determination and uplifting spirit.CommentsDwight P. BostwickAttorney, partner at Zuckerman Spaeder LLPJust a week before the start of football season, the NFL announced the settlement of the concussion litigation brought by its former players. As a lawyer representing a number of former NFL players, I find myself questioning many aspects of the deal.CommentsDax ShepardActor, director, and writerA few days ago my wife and I wrote tweets urging folks to boycott publications that buy photos of celebrities\u0027 children without the consent of their parents. We got a myriad of responses, ranging from heartfelt solidarity to vitriolic rage. Now, against the advice of my better half, I am going to address some of those Twitter detractors.Comments (66)Marwan BisharaAl Jazeera\u0027s senior political analyst and host of the Al Jazeera program \u0027Empire\u0027So what explains Obama\u0027s detachment or even apathy towards the instability and violence engulfing the region? And why is the second term president so restrained in the absence of reelection worries?CommentsCarla BuzasiEditor-in-Chief of The Huffington Post UK \u0026 Global Editorial Director for Huffington Post LifestyleFrom across the globe we\u0027ve gathered stories about businesses harnessing these values to improve their work places, politicians practising mindfulness and bankers being encouraged to -- shock, horror! -- nap at work.CommentsLarry StraussVeteran high school teacher and coach, writerGun control. Self-control. Lack of parental control. There is a lot to say about senseless killing -- and there is very little other kind of killing on the streets of South Los Angeles and many other communities.Comments (39)Barbara BrunoNFL Analyst and Commentator, Independent Film Producer, Non-Profit Grant WriterIn the shadow of the NFL\u0027s biggest game, the Broncos defensive and Seahawks offensive players must feel like the forgotten stepchildren of Super Bowl hype.CommentsAvital Norman NathmanWriter and editor of The Good Mother Myth: Redefining Motherhood to Fit RealityA male politician who is also a father gets to be, first and foremost, a male politician. But a female politician who is also a mother? It\u0027s completely different.Comments (26)Susan Blumenthal, M.D.Public Health Editor, The Huffington Post; Former U.S. Assistant Surgeon GeneralThe 25th anniversary of World AIDS Day on Dec. 1 was a fitting occasion to mark the progress that has been made towards ending this disease globally and to identify the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.CommentsSusan Casey-LefkowitzDirector of International Programs, Natural Resources Defense CouncilLet\u0027s review how completely this dirty energy project fails the national interest test on a few critical points.CommentsNoah MichelsonExecutive Editor, HuffPost Gay VoicesWhy does this matter? Well, aside from the fact that claiming that we can choose to be queer (and, by extension, straight) fuels the barbaric practice of \"conversion therapy,\" it can also have unthinkably terrifying consequences in other ways.Comments (138)Emma GraySenior Editor, HuffPost WomenJackson simply had the bad luck to be a black woman in possession of a nipple. Even today, we see the policing of women\u0027s bodies -- and their breasts in particular -- by media gatekeepers.CommentsAdam GrantWharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027What makes a job meaningless? After more than 40 years of research, we know that people struggle to find meaning when they lack autonomy, variety, challenge, performance feedback, and the chance to work on a whole product or service from start to finish.Comments (56)Scott BennerStay-at-home dad and author, Life Is Short, Laundry Is Eternal: Confessions of a Stay-At-Home DadThe boy in me who was raised on Buddy Ryan football was shocked to hear himself say no. My ego and pride were alive with the notion that someone thought my son would be a good football player, but the idea of him banging his head into other people terrified me.CommentsThomas E. PerezU.S. Secretary of LaborApprenticeships are a win-win: They provide workers with sturdy rungs on that ladder of opportunity and employers with the skilled workers they need to grow their businesses. And yet they\u0027ve been an undervalued and underutilized tool in our nation\u0027s workforce development arsenal.CommentsDavid CoatesWorrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsFine rhetoric well delivered, mildly progressive goals modestly pursued, and a strong statement of the continuing importance of American exceptionalism and American power. But just because a president cannot do a full and honest stock-taking of our overall condition, that doesn\u0027t mean that we shouldn\u0027t.Comments (13)Jay DoddStudent, Tufts UniversitySelf-proclaimed \"allies\" terrify me. If a part of your claimed identity relies on a struggle you have no or little access to -- I am given pause. It is easy to speak positively about marginalized groups, but as soon as you take credit or praise for it, only your success will be remembered.CommentsChristine OrganAuthor; Freelance Writer; BloggerI have spent too much time and energy making myself feel inadequate and somehow lacking, and I know too many people who are great people, who are well-loved people, who also feel inadequate and somehow lacking. And it makes me sad and angry and frustrated... and absolutely determined to find a way to stop the madness.CommentsMJ RosenbergBlogger, Tikkun, Washington SpectatorIt didn\u0027t take much. Just the power of the presidency, the State of the Union, and the whole country watching. Plus the president\u0027s will.CommentsKadia BlagroveCultural writer based in NYC.Because I was directly in front of her, I had no choice but to twerk in her face. Over the course of the next hour, I felt her despair turn into resentment and then contempt. I just knew for sure that it was directed toward me and my booty.Comments (64)Mark BemesderferWriter, EducatorAnyone who has raised or spent much time with teenagers knows that they can argue. Passionately, effectively, and tirelessly. Yet these same skills seem to abandon many high school students when the topic is not personal but academic.CommentsDave BergFormer producer, \u0027The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\u0027What\u0027s next for Leno? Will he just do stand-up appearances and work on his cars? Not a chance. I worked with him at The Tonight Show for 18 years. He has the mentality of a boxer. No boxer would ever walk out of the ring in the middle of a fight in which he was pulverizing his opponent.Comments (27)Cedric Cogell, 2014.31.01Johnny Nevin, 2014.31.01Roger Johnson, 2014.31.01Raghida Dergham, 2014.31.01Fawn Weaver, 2014.31.01Sarah Rudell Beach, 2014.31.01Noah Greenwald, 2014.31.01Gregory P.
