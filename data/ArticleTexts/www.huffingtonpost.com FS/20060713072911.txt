{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"APFrom katrinadestruction.comfrom perso.orange.frFrom shawnzukeweb.comWatching the way Horacio Elizondo, the Argentinean referee, boldly reacted to Zinedine Zidane\u0027s head-butt, resolutely showing him a red card and ejecting him from the World Cup final, made me think about how great it would be if we had the political equivalent of a red card -- something we could flash for campaign fouls and astonishing acts of bad political behavior that would immediately remove the perpetrators from the political pitch. For instance, wouldn\u0027t you love to red-card Joe Lieberman for trying to have his primary and his independent run, too? And can you imagine how many red cards Patrick Fitzgerald would have whipped out during his Plamegate investigation? Grand juries are okay, but red cards rule!READ POST | comments (15)07.10.2006 Martin GarbusThe two Republican appointed members of the moderate bloc, Stevens and Souter, were most consistently opposed to the conservative bloc, more so than Breyer or Ginsberg.READ POST | comments07.10.2006 Eric AltermanWhen I told Zengerle that while I found the letter to be \"both insane and obscene,\" I couldn\u0027t find anything threatening in its contents, he found my conclusions disturbing.READ POST | comments07.10.2006 John SeeryI don\u0027t know whether it\u0027s time to ring a bell to alert the country that colleges across the nation seem to be graduating a generation of wimpy, diffident, clueless, unmotivated menREAD POST | comments (14)07.10.2006 Blake FleetwoodHammoud drove around Beirut in a red MG convertible and drank liquor and partied with women, all the while secretly planning to blow up NYC tunnels.
