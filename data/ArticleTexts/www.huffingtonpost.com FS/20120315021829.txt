{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"As the seemingly endless GOP nomination fight grinds on, it\u0027s becoming clearer who President Obama\u0027s most formidable opponent is likely to be: himself. Sometimes a long, hard-fought primary is good for a party, forcing the candidates to become stronger, better, and more responsive to the electorate. And sometimes a long, hard-fought primary is bad for a party. Like this year\u0027s GOP race. It\u0027s not surprising that on Intrade the chances of President Obama getting reelected currently stand at around 60 percent, and that crack prognosticator Nate Silver has also listed President Obama \"as about a 60 percent favorite\" against Mitt Romney. And that was in mid-February, before the GOP\u0027s bizarre equation of religious liberty with curtailing access to contraception. So for me this election now has two tracks: 1) Obama vs. the GOP nominee; and 2) Obama vs. Obama.Read Post | Comments (1,749)Ben Affleck, 03/14/12Academy Award-winning actor and screenwriterI believe there is no mission more urgent than to help children who are suffering and I applaud Invisible Children for raising the awareness of Kony.

I don\u0027t mean they are actually on the take. Too Third World.

Talbott, 03/14/12Author, \"Survival Investing: How to Prosper Amid Thieving Banks and Corrupt Governments\"I was pleasantly surprised this morning to read in the New York Times an op-ed piece by Greg Smith, who had decided to leave Goldman Sachs on moral grounds. As another alumnus, I wanted to tell Greg that he is not alone in his feelings.Read Post | Comments (28)Cristina Page, 03/14/12Author, \u0027How the Pro-Choice Movement Saved America\u0027If the Bishops insist there\u0027s no firewall great enough to protect them from our contraceptive activities, then they also must admit there\u0027s no firewall great enough to protect us from their religious activities.Read Post | CommentsJonathan Weiler, 03/14/12Director of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel HillTom Friedman\u0027s column today calls for re-thinking American capitalism by striking a series of \"grand bargains,\" and as usual his analysis of what stands in the way of such grand bargains bears no relationship to the realities of American politics.Read Post | CommentsKatie Goodman, 03/14/12Award-winning comic, actress, author, creative coach, and social activistRead Post | CommentsJames Kwak, 03/14/12Associate professor, University of Connecticut School of Law, and co-author, White House BurningIf people realize that the government\u0027s principal activity is protecting them against long-term risks through programs that they already like, they may change their opinions of the government and their willingness to pay for it. We can all dream.Read Post | Comments (53)Bill Bigelow, 03/14/12Co-director, Zinn Education Project; Curriculum editor, Rethinking SchoolsFirst, does anyone really think that students will remember anything from the books\u0027 dull and lifeless paragraphs? Today\u0027s textbooks contain no stories of actual people. We meet no one, learn nothing of anyone\u0027s life, encounter no injustice, no resistance. This is a curriculum bound for boredom.Read Post | CommentsMike Lux, 03/14/12Co-founder and CEO, Progressive StrategiesIt is amazing we live in a culture that allows the wealthiest and most powerful companies in the country cheat their clients and the public at large with impunity, and that their closest political allies aren\u0027t held to account as well.Read Post | CommentsKarthik Palaniappan, 03/14/12High school junior in Issaquah, WAThe fact of the matter is that the Kony 2012 video is misleading. This propaganda was meant to create a popular outcry -- which it did. However, not everybody knows, or has considered, the facts.Read Post | CommentsErin Gross, 03/14/12Writer, The Silver Screened Novels NetworkIn a world that is swamped with book-to-movie adaptations, one must wonder if the latest one will be as good as the book.

In Europe, the numbers are even worse. But for women to really get ahead in the boardroom, we need a quota on how much time men spend helping out at home.Read Post | CommentsAdam Levin, 03/14/12Founder, Credit.comEven the farsighted Founding Fathers could not have foreseen this -- the Fed is now on Twitter!

When we say that the Military Council is responsible for all these crimes, the Military Council gets angry and sees us as provocateurs trying to bring down the state.Read Post | CommentsDr. Boyce Watkins, 03/14/12Professor, Syracuse UniversityI found myself confused and disturbed by the shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin.
