{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"We often bemoan the fact that those in Washington who get it wrong never seem to be held accountable, and those who get it right (even if not right away) always seem to be marginalized. Well, President Obama\u0027s nomination of Chuck Hagel as Secretary of Defense is how the system should -- but seldom does -- work. I\u0027m not saying Chuck Hagel is perfect or that I agree with every position he\u0027s ever taken, but leadership isn\u0027t about conforming to a checklist. Hagel is being nominated for a particular job, and for that job, he has a strong record. And this is exactly why his critics are grasping for straws -- from questions about his \"temperament\" to the insinuation that he is an anti-Semite -- because they don\u0027t want to discuss that record, nor what this debate is really about: the Iraq War.Read Post | Comments (290)Elizabeth Rigby, 01/15/13Political scientist and policy analyst; assistant professor of public policy and public administration, George Washington UniversityWe don\u0027t need a national discourse on poverty but a shift in attention away from disadvantage toward an examination of the concentrated advantages provided to those already flourishing in our society. It then becomes clear that it is not only poverty but inequality that plagues the poor.Read Post | Comments (97)Jill Puleri, 01.15.2013Global Industry Leader, Retail Global Services, IBMWho came out on top this past holiday season? Shoppers like you and me, hands down. Yet, there\u0027s no secret why merchants are getting smarter. They have to. Today\u0027s 20/20 digital consumer is dictating the terms of the shopping experience.Read Post | CommentsNina Bahadur, 01/14/13Assistant Editor, HuffPost WomenI\u0027m apparently supposed to look at each often-humiliated, clueless, insulting, entitled female character as an approximation of me.

For the past ten years, an ellipsis has hovered over my head and heart as I wondered if another face would come to our family.Read Post | Comments (67)G. Roger Denson, 01/15/13Cultural critic, essayist, novelist and screenwriter published with Parkett and Art in AmericaThe anti-Zero Dark Thirty camp indicates in their statements that they have little awareness of the principles of irony, catharsis, and sublimation that dramatizations use to separate depiction of heinous activities from endorsement of them.Read Post | Comments (15)Russell Simmons, 01/15/13Founder, GlobalGrind.comIn an era when the sadly misguided believe that we should fight fire with fire and arm teachers with weapons, I believe we should be supporting programs that don\u0027t need the threat of violence to make young people put down their guns.Read Post | CommentsBianca Bosker, 01/15/13Executive Tech Editor, The Huffington PostA survey of 1,000 cell phone owners commissioned by Nuance, a provider of voice recognition software, suggests that people are developing closer relationships with the virtual assistants on their smartphones.Read Post | Comments (16)Dale Cooper, 01/15/13Porn performer and writerI believe that the prosecution for the United States threatened Swartz\u0027s emotional and physical well-being, and, faced with a court battle that he could not possibly finance with his own personal wealth, he took his own life. It bullied Swartz, and it should be held responsible in some way.Read Post | CommentsMichael Hogan and Christopher Rosen, 01/15/13Look, I get why rooting for Steven Spielberg can feel like rooting for the New York Yankees, but I think he overcame his worst instincts in this movie and created what you might call a late masterpiece. It\u0027s not my favorite movie of the year, but it\u0027s the strongest candidate for Best Picture.Read Post | Comments (87)Dan Froomkin, 01/15/13Contributing editor, Nieman ReportsHad John Kiriakou actually engaged in torture, he wouldn\u0027t be in any trouble at all -- he never even would have been investigated.

A sudden shroud over Iran, however, does not mean that the dispute is going to go away. The Iranian spectre will pop up again in unexpected ways.Read Post | Comments (18)Molly Davies, 01/14/13MotherMr. President, I am writing to you as a wife and mother of two young daughters, whose 34-year-old husband, Matthew Davies, faces 10 years or more in federal prison for providing medical marijuana to sick people in California, even though he complied with state law concerning medicinal cannabis.Read Post | Comments (670)Paul Brandeis Raushenbush, 01/15/13Senior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostWhile the original choice to give the final \u0027good prayer\u0027 at your inauguration came under fire and withdrew that doesn\u0027t mean there aren\u0027t plenty of us to rise to this occasion in your time of need.Read Post | CommentsJennifer Niven, 01/15/13Author, \"Becoming Clementine\"Nancy Wake, the former WWII spy called \u0027The White Mouse\u0027 by the Germans for her ability to evade capture, died last year at 98.

Instead, it feels more like the exclamation point on an administration whose commitment to maintaining secrecy, blocking transparency, limiting the flow of information and squelching dissent has been both unexpected and shocking.Read Post | Comments (101)Rocky Kistner, 01/15/13Media associate, NRDCThe climate is changing, it\u0027s getting warmer and dryer in some areas and wetter and more flood-prone in others. Extreme weather is the winner in this game of fossil fuel addition, and we are all losers if we don\u0027t change our dirty-energy habits.Read Post | Comments (35)John Cusack, 01/14/13Makes filmsRecently, I sat down with George Washington Law School professor and constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley and my close friend Kevin McCabe to discuss WikiLeaks\u0027 impact on transparency, the government\u0027s response, and the comparison to the Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg.Read Post | Comments (188)Craig Newmark, 01/15/13Founder, craigslist and craigconnects.orgThe VA is getting a lot of good work done, using IT to much better serve veterans by helping address the disability claims backlog, maybe their biggest challenge.

Meanwhile, movement conservatives and Republican leaders alike know that the GOP faces an existential crisis: It has to regain its competitiveness with Hispanic voters or go the way of the Whigs. So what is likely to happen?Read Post | Comments (61)Joan Price, 01/12/13Senior Sex ExpertBy hiding your body and being embarrassed by it, you\u0027re buying into our youth-obsessed culture that says that only young, firm, fertile bodies can be sexy and alluring.

Kennedy, 01/15/13Professor of political management and director of the Graduate School of Political Management, George Washington UniversityThe sparse result of months of partisan wrestling over the fiscal cliff portends a reduced likelihood that any of President Obama\u0027s second-term priorities, including immigration reform, will be addressed in the manner he outlines in his upcoming inaugural address.Read Post | Comments (114)Dr. Michael J.
