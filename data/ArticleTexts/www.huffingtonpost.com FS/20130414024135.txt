{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundConnecticut last week was not alone in moving forward on gun safety. New York, Colorado, and Maryland have all passed new gun violence prevention legislation in the last four months. In each of these states, ordinary citizens have said no more and lawmakers have displayed the courage to listen and lead. Now it\u0027s time for Congress to lead for children and for all of us in every state -- not just some -- to demand action not obstruction and to put protection of child and citizen safety ahead of guns -- especially deadly assault weapons and high capacity ammunition magazines that should not be in civilian hands. The gun violence prevention bills pending in Congress deserve a vote. This time there must be change.Comments (217)Jennifer 8.

Bernie SandersIndependent U.S. Senator from VermontDo we agree with Senator Inhofe that global warming is a \"hoax\" and that we do not want the federal government to address that issue? Or do we agree with the overwhelming majority of scientists who tell us that that we must act boldly and aggressively to protect the future of this planet?Comments (634)Natalia Brzezinskiwriter, mother, wife of U.S. Ambassador to Sweden, women\u0027s empowerment activistFocus on finding something you love and work really hard at it. If you love what you do, you\u0027re probably good at it. This is the secret to Stina Honkamaa\u0027s success, according to the humble and effervescent Country Director of Google Sweden.CommentsJames ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027In January of 2012, we asked Americans whether or not they were hopeful that the Arab Spring would bring about positive change. By more than two to one they answered in the affirmative. But in the tumultuous year and a half that has followed, Americans have lost that hope.Comments (38)Norman LearFounder, People for the American WayA new law that is being proposed says the buyer has to wait three days if he wants to buy a gun that when you point it at a human being and pull the trigger you can kill him. Or her. Or that child there.Comments (107)Mike LuxCo-Founder, Democracy PartnersPublic opinion matters a great deal in the American system of government, just as it does in any democracy. But it sure isn\u0027t the only thing that matters, as the following true story demonstrates. It\u0027s what I call A Tale of Two Constituencies.Comments (58)Olly LambertDocumentary filmmaker for FRONTLINE and the UK’s Channel 4.As the death toll mounts and the West struggles to decide what to do, ordinary Syrians like Ahmad are looking to other powers to give them the weapons or simply the courage they crave. Perhaps after two years, Bashar al-Assad is finally getting the war he always wanted.Comments (67)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistLast year, Time magazine reported that more than a third of American women are now the family breadwinner, yet still \"lag behind men in actions crucial to building wealth and security, such as investing and having a long-term money plan.\" That\u0027s not very cheerful news.Comments (51)Jeff CohenAuthor and media criticToday there\u0027s an elephant in the room: a huge, yet ignored, issue that largely explains why Social Security is now on the chopping block. And why other industrialized countries have free college education and universal healthcare, but we don\u0027t.Comments (693)John PavleyCTO @ The Huffington Post, BloggerI want the critical messages to get through without having to set-up exceptions and hide all my toys. If the house is on fire or North Korea does something naughty, I want to know about it.CommentsJanice L. MarturanoFounder and Executive Director, Institute for Mindful LeadershipWe need to make a change. We want to be the kind of leader we know we can be. And so we practice, a little each day. We learn to stop, to be still, and to choose. And in the process, we learn about this innate, miraculous capacity \u0027to be vibrantly alive in repose\u0027.CommentsPsyche Williams-ForsonAssociate Professor, Department of American Studies at University of Maryland, College ParkWhy can\u0027t we just eat our Chinese food or soul food in blissful ignorance, caring not about their origins or the historical characters that helped to inspire the foods on our plates?CommentsDylan RatiganNew York Times Best-Selling author, entrepreneur and formerly the host of MSNBC\u0027s The Dylan Ratigan ShowBeyond jobs, food and our vets, few things keep me up more than the disastrous functionality of our prison system. It is, after all, no secret that the U.S. houses 25 percent of the world\u0027s inmates, while representing a mere 5 percent of the world\u0027s population.Comments (88)Isabel KaplanNovelist, www.isabelkaplan.comNot one to be left out of the discussion, Jay-Z just dropped a new track called \"Open Letter\" (produced by Timbaland and Swizz Beatz) in which he discusses his recent trip to Cuba. He raps: \"I\u0027m in Cuba, I love Cubans/ This talk about Communism is so confusing.\" I feel ya, Jay-Z.CommentsAllen FrancesProfessor Emeritus, Duke UniversityThis well-meaning program is a serious mistake for two reasons. First, it is no more than a politically correct, cosmetic solution that distracts attention from what really needs to be done. Second, it will likely wind up doing much more harm than good.Comments (121)Jerry KrothAssociate Professor, Graduate counseling psychology program at Santa Clara UniversityAn intelligent, rational, and balanced American president would realize -- even if he had only an introductory course in abnormal psychology -- that it is time to stop our military maneuvers in South Korea, now, immediately, and without equivocation.Comments (432)Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOWe are now watching the second botching of a Cyprus rescue in less than a month. The implications cannot be good for Cyprus... and for Europe as a whole.Comments (40)Arianna HuffingtonThis week, as Huffington launches an ongoing series on how we can reduce the destructive force of stress in our lives, Ben Hallman looks at allegations of abuse and misconduct within an industry that began to boom when the housing market began to tank, and Lori Fradkin shares the wisdom she\u0027s gleaned in the course of attending 21 weddings.CommentsAlexandra ConstantinouJunior, Ohio State UniversitySome people have and will continue to call me barefoot and crazy. Springtime in the Midwest isn\u0027t the warmest weather and I cannot promise you that it will be comfortable for your toes. Despite all of this, I will continue to go barefoot every year for One Day Without Shoes. Why?CommentsCatherine L. TullyFounder, 4dancers.orgAs she touched my hand to adjust it, I was keenly aware that this same hand had also touched Balanchine, Nureyev and countless others. It was hard to wrap your head around. I was thirteen years old and I had never been more intimidated. Or more thrilled.CommentsJamie SchlerFood blogger; Author, \u0027Life’s a Feast\u0027Could it also be the seafood, hushpuppies, citrus and key lime pie of my native Florida? I, like my home country, am a cultural melting pot, and each of these foods is a part of who I am as an American.CommentsAnna Deavere SmithActress and playwrightNo matter how broken the system is, no matter how many broken moments our individual lives might survive, we all have a chance to make real the basic human drive to heal. We can do that, whatever our position in life is.Comments (21)Brian Levin, J.D.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityNeither America nor baseball could have any legitimacy when they deprived the dreams and opportunity of their children. At its core, baseball, like the nation that gave birth to it, is about aspirations; to teamwork, sportsmanship, merit and fair play.CommentsKim Siegalblogger, mamamzungu.comEsther felt she had no choice but to take in these twins as her own. Having raised her own children largely as a single mother, she couldn\u0027t imagine them growing up without a \"mother\u0027s love.\"CommentsNina BurleighJournalist; Author, \u0027The Fatal Gift of Beauty\u0027 and forthcoming book on women and IslamistsIt\u0027s very popular right now to talk about bullying. But it is way past time to start talking about misogynist bullying as a separate category of abuse aimed at young girls, and as something that requires a separate cure.Comments (241)Martha BurkMoney Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsWas the 10-year slog, the fear from death threats and stalking, taunts, and t-shirts with our heads on pig\u0027s bodies -- and worse -- worth it? Yep. One more barrier broken, one more myth about \"woman\u0027s place\" shattered.Comments (27)Jessica ZaleskiWriter\"Glee\" attempts to tackle the issue of gun violence in our schools, but was it worthwhile, or did it feel manipulative?Comments (42)Bob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowYesterday, the president released his 2014 budget and proposed the truly stupid idea of linking Social Security cost-of-living-adjustments to something called \"chained CPI.\" Not only is the idea a punitive one for seniors, but the president is also fueling a series of inside-D.C. myths.Comments (736)Meg FavreauWriter, comedian, and author of Little Old Lady Recipes.Omg ladies, dating is awful, right?
