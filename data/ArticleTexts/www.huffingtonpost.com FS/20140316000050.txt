{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Kathleen ReardonProfessor, USC Marshall School; Author, \u0027The Secret Handshake\u0027 and \u0027Shadow Campus\u0027Opponents to President Obama\u0027s efforts to put millions of dollars in the pockets of people who\u0027ve been working overtime for no pay want you to worry about business again. Conservative business groups have responded with all-too-familiar claims of the harm Obama\u0027s plan will bring to their members. House Speaker John Boehner had this to say: \"The president\u0027s policies are making it difficult for employers to expand employment. And until the president\u0027s policies get out of the way, employers are going to continue to sit on their hands.\" It\u0027s time to stop listening to endless repetition of the narrow-minded view that rules and laws should not be changed if they pose even a whiff of difficulty for business. More often than not, it\u0027s a bogus argument and a selfish one at that.Comments (130)TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"If thinking of cerebral palsy makes you think of someone sad or helpless, then watch this talk and let comedian Maysoon Zayid blow your mind. She\u0027s fierce, she\u0027s funny, and she refuses to let you feel sorry for her.Comments (64)Harris Wofford and Tad DaleyIn the wake of the extraordinary media focus on the 50th anniversary of President Kennedy\u0027s assassination, and on the search to define his legacy, a significant element was overlooked: the story of a young congressman joining in a legislative initiative to advance no less than the solution to the problem of war.CommentsNoah MichelsonExecutive Editor, HuffPost Gay VoicesAs you can imagine, anyone with half a brain was pissed about Ezra Klein\u0027s decision to hire Brandon Ambrosino. Why, oh why, when there are so many brilliant young queer writers doing such amazing work, would he choose this guy?Comments (174)Alan SingerSocial studies educator, Hofstra UniversityThe reading list for the New York State Common Core English/Language Arts curriculum looks like someone took a handful of darts and threw them at a wall with boxes labeled with different grade levels. There are no discernible themes and at a first glance no patterns at all.Comments (49)Robert TurnerDirector, United Nations Relief and Works Agency in GazaIt is impossible not to be touched by the apocalyptic scenes emerging from the Palestinian refugee camp of Yarmouk in Damascus. But the cameras, and the donors, seem to have moved on.CommentsMarian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe sad truth is you can work full time in America and not be able to meet your family\u0027s basic needs. A parent working full time at the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour earns $15,080 a year before taxes. That\u0027s $4,700 below the poverty level for a parent with two children.Comments (72)James ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027While reviewing polling data on Israeli and Palestinian attitudes towards the peace effort, what comes through clearly is the obvious disconnect between the views of both groups and the extent to which this divide is driven by the Israeli-centric language used in framing many of the issues.CommentsElizabeth RiderHealth coach, blogger, wellness expert, speakerI\u0027ve redefined my own success to mean being relevant to people who need my help, giving more than I take, and living life on my own terms. The letters behind my name and my rank within a company just don\u0027t matter.CommentsRobin LakoffProfessor of linguistics emerita, University of California, BerkeleyWe need to understand why a word like \u0027bossy\u0027 exists with its current meaning, and change the world that makes it meaningful and useful.Comments (64)Tim StobierskiAspiring author and editorStudents around the country have families who have been evicted from homes; parents who have used their retirement accounts to pay the mortgage until it ran dry; rent and student loan payments that leave them with less than 50 dollars a month with which to buy food.Comments (63)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027It\u0027s often assumed that people are paid what they\u0027re worth. But how does it really work?Comments (771)Domenick ScuderaProfessor of Theater, Ursinus CollegeI have developed a \"hidden gay agenda\" movie test using the logic of the conservatives who are criticizing the animated Disney film Frozen. Applied to any number of movie classics, this test proves to be enlightening.Comments (33)Allison VesterfeltWriterYou hate your job. You try to pretend like you don\u0027t but you do. You get in the car every morning, with your coffee in hand, and take a deep breath.CommentsJohn FefferCo-director, Foreign Policy In FocusA major flaw in the approach the United States has taken toward North Korea is the \"all-or-nothing\" attitude. Either North Korea agrees at the beginning that it will give up its entire nuclear program or all bets are off.CommentsDiane RavitchResearch Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027Wall Street loves charter schools. Andrew Cuomo wants to be re-elected governor of New York with a large majority. One of his biggest sources of money is Wall Street. Cuomo now wants to take charge of dispensing millions in public funds to charter schools for construction, and he wants to assure them that they can have public space without paying rent.Comments (299)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorWall Street gamblers are still paid huge money and are again creeping toward reckless misbehavior. Their corporate crime wave strip-mined the economy for young workers and is draining away their ability to afford basic goods.Comments (27)Krista BarthAttorneyWhy do people marry people they know are unkind, unfaithful, selfish, or without common values or interests?Comments (26)Rep. Louise SlaughterU.S. Congresswoman from New York\u0027s 25th DistrictTwo years ago today, a little-noticed, but profoundly important, trade agreement between the United States and South Korea took effect.CommentsPatrick SmithAirline pilot, air travel columnist and authorIt\u0027s fascinating how this story has moved from being one about a presumed airplane crash to, really, a mystery story. It\u0027s the very missing-ness of the plane that the public finds so captivating.CommentsLinda VarleseEditor, HuffPost ItalyNot a day goes by that I don\u0027t look for him in other people\u0027s faces. Not a day goes by that I don\u0027t grasp to hold the memories together. Not a day goes by that I don\u0027t try to hear his voice again so that I won\u0027t lose it. Not a day goes by that I don\u0027t try to question him for the answers to my doubts.CommentsFodor\u0027sFodors.comSpring in Europe is guaranteed to dazzle and delight your senses, whether you\u0027re looking to take off to an exclusive enclave, the newest hot spot, or a trendy metropolis for shopping and time on the beach.

Forget rose-colored glasses; people peer at my child through the lens of disability. Oftentimes, they regret that he has cerebral palsy. This I can tell from the pity stares or pity-speak.CommentsJessica RassetteBlogger, Photographer, www.bubandteebs.comI could be a smoother version of myself, less sleep-deprived, better dressed; my list of worries could begin and end only with me.
