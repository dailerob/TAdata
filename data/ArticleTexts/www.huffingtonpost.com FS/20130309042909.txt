{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorToday\u0027s jobs report is widely being viewed as a sign of an improving job market, a view I share with (of course) caveats. The biggest question is whether the recent acceleration of payroll growth sticks, especially as the sequester takes hold, which it hasn\u0027t yet. So far, both the stock and the job markets have said \"sequester?... what\u0027s a sequester?\" But unemployment is still high, the labor force participation rate shows evidence of continued weak demand, and that\u0027s taking its toll on wage growth. We\u0027ll need a lot more months like this to get back on track.Read Post | Comments (11)Dr. Philip Zimbardo, 03/08/13Psychologist, AuthorWhy did some kids give in and start down that slippery slope of evil, while others resisted and stayed on the right side of that line separating good from evil?Read Post | Comments (234)Bob Cesca, 03/08/13Political Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowThe lack of nuance, as well as the lack of a sense of history on both the far-right (and the far-left for that matter) is eerily coincidental. It\u0027s important to have oversight on drones, but let\u0027s get real here.Read Post | Comments (800)Marlo Thomas, 03/08/13Award-winning actress, author and activistOne of the worst phrases I\u0027ve ever heard is \"empty calories.\" Who wants to ingest extra calories that are doing absolutely nothing for us? But many of us are doing that on a daily basis.Read Post | Comments (57)Bianca Jagger, 03/08/13Founder and Chair, Bianca Jagger Human Rights FoundationMore than ever, as we face the challenges of combating climate change, deforestation, the melting of the Arctic sea ice, we will need these women: their skills, their wisdom and their knowledge.Read Post | CommentsChristine Lagarde, 03/08/13Managing Director, IMFToday, on International Women\u0027s Day, we see both amazing achievements and formidable challenges. But I am an optimist and see beyond these challenges; our daughters and granddaughters will have even better opportunities than women have today.Read Post | Comments (50)Arianna Huffington, 03/07/13This week, Tom Zeller looks at one man’s journey to build a wind farm off the shores of Cape Cod, and Dave Jamieson writes about a group of Panera Bread bakers and their battle to unionize.Read Post | Comments (32)Seth D. Harris, 03/07/13Acting Secretary of Labor for the United StatesEvery day she wonders, do I have enough money for gas? Will my car hold up just a little bit longer before I have to pay for repairs? Pattie Federico -- and 15 million workers just like her -- deserve a raise.Read Post | Comments (681)Marina Nemat, 03/08/13Writer, Fmr. Iranian prisonerEvil is not simple and does not fit in a box; it manifests itself in many shapes and forms, from the victim who becomes a torturer, the Nazi who follows orders, and the psychopath who kills without remorse, to the bystander who remains silent in the face of terrible injustice.Read Post | Comments (13)Michelangelo Signorile, 03/08/13Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesIt\u0027s certainly a great thing for an ex-president to weigh in with a reversal and give his opinion to the Supreme Court. And I commend Clinton for his evolution. But that doesn\u0027t remove this damaging act from Clinton\u0027s legacy.Read Post | Comments (34)Candace Walsh, 03/07/13Author, \u0027Licking the Spoon: A Memoir of Food, Family, and Identity\u0027I stood looking at the photo. No one would think we were the same person. My hair was long again, my figure was trim and my kids were tall and lanky, bounding around the store. There was the ghost of motherhood past, staring back at me with bleary eyes.Read Post | Comments (29)Russell Simmons, 03/07/13Founder, GlobalGrind.comWith smokescreens and a barrage of bullets, the NRA is intentionally playing into the fears of a very few people. To create more hysteria and confusion about our relationship with our government is what the NRA would like to do.Read Post | Comments (265)Nina Bahadur, 03/07/13Assistant Editor, HuffPost WomenMy specific anxiety revolves around spaces I can\u0027t get out of, but the tendrils are far-reaching. There was a point in my life where a low-level terror had an effect on everything I did, and I was too ashamed to talk about it -- even with people who were close to me.Read Post | Comments (32)Valerie Jarrett, 03/07/13Senior Advisor and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsWith the re-authorization of the Violence Against Women Act, thousands of law enforcement officers will be better equipped to stop violence before it starts, and respond to calls of help when they are needed.Read Post | Comments (516)Marie C. Wilson, 03/08/13Founder and President Emerita of The White House ProjectLet\u0027s all agree or disagree constructively with the central themes of Lean In, but let\u0027s at least join Sheryl Sandberg in finding a way for women to lead. She may be right, she may be wrong, but she\u0027s got the guts to put her ideas on the table. Do you?Read Post | CommentsSen. Kirsten Gillibrand, 03/08/13U.S. Senator from New YorkIt is deeply troubling that in 2013, our work is not done and the need to continue this fight remains. If we\u0027ve learned one thing from the recent attempts to disenfranchise voters around the country, it\u0027s that the Voting Rights Act continues to be a vital tool in the fight.Read Post | Comments (17)Kim Simon, 03/08/13Mother, Wife, Blogger, mamabythebay.comNo one ever tells you that the first six months of motherhood ain\u0027t that hot. Mothering a newborn is epic. Life-changing, poetic, falling-in-love, completely enamored, EPIC. But as wonderful as your sweet baby is, YOU my friend, are about to experience some EPIC changes of your own.Read Post | CommentsShaun Donovan, 03/08/13U.S. Secretary for Housing and Urban DevelopmentThe settlement has already far surpassed our initial expectations of total consumer relief and will likely grow to more than $50 billion. And yet, some remain unconvinced that the settlement is really making a difference or that banks are beginning to meet their obligations.Read Post | Comments (39)Adrianna Logalbo, 03/08/13Constituency Mobilization at Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN)We know that malnourished girls become malnourished women, who in turn give birth to small, malnourished children. But women like Anna are changing things by getting essential nutrients to their children in the most critical moments.Read Post | CommentsPeter Diamandis, 03/08/13Chairman/CEO, X PRIZE FoundationPhilip Rosedale, founder of Second Life, gave me a glimpse of his newest startup, called Coffee and Power, as well as his vision of the future of companies. A future where workers were far more independent and far more efficient.Read Post | CommentsJerry Jasinowski, 03/08/13Fmr. President of the National Association of ManufacturersThis bull market is not driven primarily by economic reality on the ground but rather by the Fed\u0027s endless quantitative easing that is now being replicated by our trading partners around the globe. As a result, the world is awash in trillions of dollars in easy money.Read Post | Comments (57)Jeffrey Small, 03/08/13Author, \"The Jericho Deception\" and \"The Breath of God\"Can we combine the insights from religion and science in making sense of death and suffering?Read Post | Comments (14)Doug Bandow, 03/08/13Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteThe fact that government devotes too much to Social Security is no argument for spending too much on the military. With the threat of runaway deficits, debts, and interest payments, the U.S. cannot afford any budget sacred cows.Read Post | Comments (82)Laura Lee Carter, 03/08/13Midlife researcher, author, psychotherapistCome to find out, this spring marks the 40th year since I graduated from high school.

So I joined their Facebook page and started looking around.Read Post | Comments (26)Evelyn Leopold, 03/08/13Veteran journalist reporting from the United NationsNo one can predict what Pyongyang will do, which frequently threatens action, then reneges and then does something anyway to make sure the world and the region pay attention. It has the bomb but not (yet) the means to deliver it via a missile.Read Post | Comments (15)Rich Grant, 03/08/13Senior Contributing writer for WatchBoom.comWhen Las Vegas introduced showgirls in 1959, the law was that for them to be nude, they could not move. That led to the iconic image of showgirls just standing still.Read Post | CommentsBrian Levin, J.D., 03/08/13Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityThe Obama administration\u0027s decision to try Osama bin Laden\u0027s son-in-law, Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, in civilian court highlights deep fundamental disagreement about how to bring foreign nationals captured overseas and accused of terrorism to justice.Read Post | Comments (37)Simon Baron-Cohen, 03/08/13Whilst the word \u0027evil\u0027 is used as if it is an explanation (\"He did X because he is evil\"), in fact evil is just a word meaning \"the absence of good\", getting us into a dangerous circularity (\"He did X because he is not good\").Read Post | Comments (24)Robert L. Borosage, 03/07/13President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureCongress has only two choices. The big banks can be nationalized and treated as public utilities. The public would pocket their profits and cover their losses. Or the big banks can be broken up, and be accountable to both the law and the market.Read Post | Comments (538)Arianna Huffington, 03/06/13The devastating consequences of that war will continue for decades, but a full accounting has still yet to happen. Allowing the toxic mixture of lies, deception and rationalizations that led to that war to go unchallenged makes it more likely that we will make similar tragic mistakes in the future. So I hope we can use this moment to assess what really happened, to look back in order to look forward.Read Post | Comments (697)Bianca Bosker, 03/07/13Executive Tech Editor, The Huffington PostFor five years, News Feed has folded disparate types of information into a single place, so that a best friend\u0027s photos get little more consideration than a news site\u0027s latest links.
