{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week began with the nation processing the verdict in the George Zimmerman trial. It ended with President Obama interrupting a press conference to give a remarkable and heartfelt talk about the verdict, and the history of race and violence in America. \"Trayvon Martin could have been me,\" the president said. Having a president who can personalize and voice the frustration African-Americans feel about the verdict is an amazing moment in our history. And while the jury\u0027s decision can\u0027t be reversed, laws that encourage violence and more gun deaths can. As can other policies and practices -- like the drug war and stop-and-frisk -- whose effects fall disproportionately on minorities. Indeed, given that the president has admitted to past drug use, he might look at the hundreds of thousands languishing in prison on non-violent drug offenses and also say, they \"could have been me.\"Comments (204)Gary HartPresident, Hart International, Ltd.For those who viscerally hate the Russians, there will always be reasons, however obscure, to justify their resentment. But Edward Snowden hardly provides the justification.Comments (328)Eve EnslerTony award winning playwright, performer and activistI am not Trayvon Martin. I will never know what it feels like to live in the skin, in the daily rhythms and predeterminations of a black boy or man in America. But as a woman, there are things I do know and things that I have experienced that bring us into the same story, the same struggle.Comments (617)QuestloveDrummer, The RootsI do have desires to go to certain places and do certain things and enjoy the perks and benefits of a person who works his arse off as much as I do. So I got over my hangups of not wanting to be the odd guy in the room some time around 2007. Mixed results at best.Comments (376)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The geo-political divide has become so palpable that being wealthy in America today means not having to come across anyone who isn\u0027t.Comments (601)Arianna HuffingtonToday, Points of Light, an organization that encourages Americans to volunteer, announced the 5,000th Daily Point of Light Award.Comments (124)Mohamed A.

And we must get this right for children: not for test makers, not for adult interests, but for children -- especially the poorest children.Comments (171)Kirk DouglasActorSex may fade, but love... love lasts. They don\u0027t realize that the most important element of love will be waiting for them. Romance. Beautiful romance.Comments (119)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027Death is horrible enough. But systematic injustice -- one that allows white boys to assume success, yet leads black boys to cower from the very institutions created to protect our own wellbeing -- is a travesty.Comments (1,310)Glenn CloseEmmy, Golden Globe and Tony Award winning actressMs. Hewes is the mighty litigation lawyer that I had great fun playing over five seasons of Damages. I decided to auction off pieces of her wardrobe in order to raise money for an organization that is very close to my heart -- Bring Change 2 Mind.Comments (14)Dennis SantiagoCEO of Institutional Risk AnalyticsThese are strange days indeed. If one reads this weekend\u0027s news, one gets the feeling that America is on the verge of a racial civil war. All of it is silly academic hyperbole if you step back from it but so many people are \"drunk on too much Internet\" these days.Comments (14)Robin D.G. KelleyAuthor, \u0027Africa Speaks, America Answers: Modern Jazz in Revolutionary Times\u0027Where was the NRA on Trayvon Martin\u0027s right to stand his ground? What happened to their principled position? Let\u0027s be clear: the Trayvon Martins of the world never had that right because the \"ground\" was never considered theirs to stand on.Comments (998)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarA \u0027does it or doesn\u0027t it?\u0027 debate is taking place among female voters in New York as they consider the candidacies of two politicians whose careers were rocked, at least temporarily, by sex-related scandals.Comments (597)Simon JohnsonAuthor, \u0027White House Burning: The Founding Fathers, Our National Debt, and Why It Matters To You\u0027Even Sandy Weil, former CEO of Citigroup who led the charge against the remnants of Glass-Steagall in the 1990s, concedes that this was a regrettable mistake -- and argues for all of the biggest banks to be broken up.Comments (91)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistFrom taking care of your body, to slightly altering your word-choices, to surrounding yourself with laughter (my favorite tip, btw), all of us can live up to Charlie Chaplin\u0027s famous observation about happiness.Comments (40)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkIf we allow the killing of an unarmed Black teenager to be turned into some sort of circus where the responsible party blames the victim, then we have reached the height of absurdity. But in this moment of frustration, we cannot become so disillusioned that we lose focusComments (805)Sen. Kirsten GillibrandU.S. Senator from New YorkThe military has pledged \"zero tolerance\" for sexual assaults spanning over two decades and they have failed to solve the problem on their own. And while the sexual assault provisions that were passed out of committee last month are a step forward, it was not the leap forward required.Comments (64)Matthew BerrySenior Fantasy Analyst, ESPN(*By any means necessary)Comments (30)Kelly JensenLibrarian, AuthorAdults: enjoy YA all you want to. But don\u0027t try to take away the books from the teens who they\u0027re intended to reach.Comments (69)Evan HandlerActor, author, screenwriter, and journalistWhat do I think about Trayvon Martin\u0027s death? I think the people who passed the laws, as they stand in Florida, made his death inevitable. If not his, certainly someone else\u0027s.Comments (452)Kate SpencerWriter, producerOur cultural conversation about pregnancy, birth and motherhood is way off from what the actual experience is. And it\u0027s hurting women.Comments (56)Ahmed Shihab-EldinEmmy-Nominated Producer/Host, @HuffPostLiveAmerica should recognize and leverage its influence with Egypt\u0027s military to begin pushing for more transparency and accountability, especially in regards to its brutality and dominance in Egypt\u0027s political roadmap and its economy.Comments (575)John KinnearAuthor of AskYourDadBlog.com\"You think you\u0027re [insert anything here]? Try having kids!\"Comments (2,987)Greta Van SusterenHost, Fox News\u0027 \u0027On the Record With Greta Van Susteren\u0027More lawyers and citizens should be standing up for the jury system. Destroying the jury system is dangerous. Who do you want to decide a case? those who actually heard ALL the evidence and considered it or those who simply picked sides? Trials are not about picking sides.Comments (618)Richard BransonFounder, Virgin GroupCory Monteith was a beautiful soul. His awareness of his own struggles led him to reach out to young people all over the world with deep compassion and empathy to help them through their struggles.Comments (17)Devon CornealMother, writer, lawyerMy friend reframed my day. Not by telling me to ignore what had happened, or to \"give myself a break\" or to \"move on.\" Instead, she put that day in a timeline of a thousand other days, some full of gardening and caring for our neighbors and others full of impatience and crap.Comments (65)Dylan RatiganNew York Times Best-Selling author, entrepreneur and formerly the host of MSNBC\u0027s The Dylan Ratigan ShowEvolution lies in deciding not just to act, but to do so in a visible and integrity-driven manner in an environment laden with choices -- some good and many bad. These choices and our decision to choose can bring about the type of evolution that human beings are uniquely capable of enacting.Comments (42)Russell SimmonsFounder, GlobalGrind.comWhen our laws ill-affect one community much more then another they must be challenged. I join the Trayvon Martin Foundation in their fight to end every law in America that creates the environment for a tragedy like to this to ever happen again.Comments (498)Felicity CaponFreelance writer on all things cultural and women-orientatedWhatever you choose to do with your breasts, however much you choose to expose them, campaign with them, or campaign to cover them up completely, they continue to be part of an ongoing debate about objectification, sexualisation and femininity. And that\u0027s healthy.Comments (169)Tom GreenComedian, actor and hostIt used to be if you were 16 and pregnant you would get in trouble. Now you get a reality show. You get arrested on TV after a drunken binge and become an instant millionaire.Comments (173)Arzu Kaya Uranli, 2013.21.07Holly Robinson, 2013.21.07Michael Giltz, 2013.21.07Don McNay, 2013.21.07William K.
