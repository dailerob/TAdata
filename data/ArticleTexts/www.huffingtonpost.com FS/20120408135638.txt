{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, the branches of government traded checks and balances for sticks and stones. First, President Obama fired a shot across the Supreme Court\u0027s bow, saying that to strike down his health care law would be \"an unprecedented, extraordinary step.\" Though not actually unprecedented, it would, in fact, be extraordinary -- but not as extraordinary as what came next: a Court of Appeals judge, hearing a related case, asked the Justice Department to turn in a three-page, single-spaced letter, signed by Eric Holder, explaining the executive branch\u0027s position on judicial review, a move that embarrassed even some conservative legal experts. The attorney general\u0027s response to the unusual homework assignment fell a bit short; it was only two-and-a-half pages long. Doesn\u0027t the AG know all he had to do was make his margins bigger, add a bibliography, and start off with a long quote?Read Post | CommentsMohamed A. El-Erian, 04/05/12CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOThis week\u0027s market action serves as a vivid reminder of how dependent valuations are on central bank policies. The question for markets thus boils down to whether central banks will do more; and the issues these institutions face are extremely and increasingly complex.Read Post | Comments (50)Roma Downey, 04/06/12Producer, Author, PhilanthropistMy own kids have loved Easter and the thrill of the Easter egg hunt, but they have also learned lessons along the way. As parents, it is our job to instill morals and values into our children. When they see us treat each other with kindness and respect, it leaves an imprint on them.Read Post | Comments (39)Arianna Huffington, 04/04/12You\u0027d think a ten-and-a-half year war would be a major issue in a presidential campaign. But our political and media establishments seem to regard being in a constant state of war as simply part of the \"new normal\".Read Post | Comments (1,905)Anne Sinclair, 04/03/12Editorial Director, Le Huffington PostHow do we fight abyssal deficits while maintaining employment opportunities? This is the center of all concerns. But instead of trying to answer this question, the presidential contenders are playing an entirely different game.Read Post | Comments (20)Michelangelo Signorile, 04/06/12Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay Voices; SiriusXM radio hostObama\u0027s closet on gay marriage is about as well-guarded as Liberace\u0027s was on being gay. And it\u0027s time for Obama to now kick down the closet door. It\u0027s no longer a matter of whether he can or should. He must if he wants to win the election.Read Post | Comments (572)Sarah Shourd, 04/05/12Writer, Former Hostage and Advocate for Political Prisoners in Iran, United4IranMr. Masoud Shafii did everything in his power to defend Josh\u0027s, Shane\u0027s and my innocence within the parameters of Iranian law. By punishing Mr. Shafii, the Iranian government is sending a message.Read Post | Comments (50)Gary Hart, 04/06/12President, Hart International, Ltd.While we struggle to accommodate social justice to market economics, we should also struggle with the necessity of seeking to perfect a political system that now has fallen far short of our Founders\u0027 intent.Read Post | Comments (402)Greta Van Susteren, 04/01/12Host of Fox News\u0027 \u0027On the Record with Greta Van Susteren\u0027Yes, of course the president wants his signature health care law upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, but I suspect that it would help him politically if the statute were to be struck down in its entirety.Read Post | Comments (1,019)Bill McKibben, 04/05/12Author of a dozen books, including \u0027The End of Nature\u0027 and \u0027Deep Economy\u0027There\u0027s a problem: the very word \"subsidies\" makes American eyes glaze over. If due attention is to be paid, we have to figure out a language in which to talk about them that will make it clear just how loony our policy is.Read Post | Comments (280)Marlo Thomas, 04/05/12Award-winning actress, author, and activistMichael J. Fox did not permit the ravages of a disease to extinguish his spirit. Instead, he decided to fight back rather than lay back.Read Post | Comments (140)Penn Jillette, 04/01/12Bestselling author; Larger, louder half of Penn \u0026 TellerIt was this week\u0027s episode of Celebrity Apprentice where Donald Trump and Clay Aiken understood that they didn\u0027t understand me, and feeling misunderstood by Donald Trump and Clay Aiken is its own kind of joy. Passion and art can be more important than money.Read Post | Comments (418)Alex Castellanos, 04/02/12Republican media consultantIn the Grand Old Party, we see moral standards as necessary but humbling measures of our imperfections, revealing how far and how often we fall short. The principled perfection of the left, however, requires little such humility.Read Post | Comments (1,325)Marian Wright Edelman, 04/06/12President, Children\u0027s Defense FundMillions of children in America are denied the opportunity to receive a fair and high quality education. In March, the U.S. Department of Education released new information showing that children of color face harsher discipline, have less access to rigorous course offerings, and are more often taught by lower paid and less experienced teachers. The struggle to make sure a quality education is available to every child -- and not just a privilege for a few -- is the unfinished and critical business before the nation for it will determine America\u0027s future place on the global stage in a rapidly changing competitive world.Read Post | Comments (398)Jared Bernstein, 04/04/12Senior Fellow, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesWhat\u0027s the best way to most succinctly describe the president\u0027s and the Republicans\u0027 competing visions? By examining the role of government. We should do our best to understand what the private market does best and what it does least well.Read Post | Comments (678)Mike Campbell, 04/06/12Lead guitarist, Tom Petty and The HeartbreakersI have been asked many times why I choose the guitars I use, and why I use so many. This video series answers these questions.Read Post | Comments (278)Chris Mooney, 04/05/12Author, \u0027The Republican War on Science\u0027 and \u0027The Republican Brain\u0027Truthiness is the quality of knowing something in your gut or your heart, as opposed to in your head. Colbert didn\u0027t just diagnose a deep malady in American political discourse. He also used phrases that anticipated research results on the differences between liberals and conservatives.Read Post | Comments (540)Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, 04/04/12U.S. Senator from New YorkIf we are going to restore the trust the American people have in Congress and rebuild their faith in government, increasing transparency and accountability in many aspects of how Washington does business is imperative. The STOCK Act is just a start.Read Post | Comments (134)Gavin Newsom, 04/05/12Lieutenant Governor of CaliforniaI couldn\u0027t be prouder to have former DNC chairman Howard Dean, Donald Fowler, Steve Grossman and David Wilhelm stand with us in calling on our party to include marriage equality in its 2012 platform.Read Post | Comments (127)Bill Moyers and Michael Winship, 04/02/12The FCC, which is supposed to make sure television broadcasters don\u0027t completely get away with highway or, rather, airwave robbery has proposed that stations post on the web the names of the billionaires and front organizations -- many of them super PACs -- paying for campaign ads. It\u0027s simplicity itself: give citizens access online to find out quickly and directly who\u0027s buying our elections. Hardly an unreasonable request, given how much cash the broadcasters make from their free use of the airwaves. But the broadcasting industry\u0027s response has been a simple, declarative \"Not on your life!\" It would cost too much money, they claim.Read Post | Comments (237)Sen. Jeff Merkley, 04/03/12U.S. Senator from OregonBig banks are formulating a host of arguments -- wild, off the mark arguments -- aimed at dismantling the Volcker Rule firewall between loan-making, customer-serving banks and high-risk hedge funds.Read Post | Comments (78)Simon Johnson, 04/01/12MIT professor; Co-author, \u002713 Bankers\u0027 and \u0027White House Burning\u0027; Columnist on fiscal affairsIf the Volcker Rule is implemented as planned, that would have a major negative effect on the bond yields paid by the Muppets and other leading providers of children\u0027s entertainment. No one else will ever trade these bonds to any significant degree.Read Post | Comments (34)Jacqueline Novogratz, 04/05/12Founder and CEO of Acumen Fund, Author of The Blue SweaterStanding with the poor ultimately means deciding to do what is right, not just what is easy. Standing with the poor means walking away from unethical leaders, even when their companies are \"succeeding.\"Read Post | Comments (94)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 04/05/12Author, \u0027Our Fathers, Ourselves. Daughters, Fathers, and the Changing American Family\u0027A gay man can grin and say ironically, \"I\u0027m a really good mother,\" which may mean that he performs the daily child care in his home, but his comment does not define him as a mom. Nor is a lesbian who coaches her son\u0027s hockey team a father. Both are just doing what parents do.Read Post | Comments (185)David Berri, 04/06/12Co-author, \u0027Stumbling on Wins\u0027; Economics professor, Southern Utah UniversityThe revenue per team in the NFL dwarfs what we see at the college ranks. And yet, the salaries of top coaches in both places are similar.
