{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"I\u0027m delighted to announce the launch of HuffPost Good News, a new section that will shine a much-needed spotlight on what\u0027s inspiring, what\u0027s positive, what\u0027s working -- and what\u0027s missing from what most of the media chooses to cover. Everywhere around the country, people and communities are doing amazing things, overcoming great odds, and facing real challenges with perseverance, creativity and grace. But these stories are rarely told online, in newspapers, and on TV. HuffPost Good News will be using a variety of storytelling tools to bridge that gap and connect our readers with stories of real people and their countless acts of empathy and ingenuity. Here\u0027s hoping it sets off copycat acts of good news reporting across the media.Read Post | Comments (132)Desmond Tutu, 1/12/121984 Nobel Peace Prize winnerOur own stories, experiences and gifts are the incubators of good news. When we allow our imagination to be engaged with the needs of the world around us, we actively participate in expanding love and compassion. When we do so, God is tickled pink!Read Post | Comments (15)Robert Reich, 1/12/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Aftershock\u0027If Republicans -- or Democrats, for that matter -- want to win over much of the nation\u0027s young next November, they\u0027d do well to listen carefully to Paul\u0027s positions on national defense and civil liberties.Read Post | Comments (158)Michael Shaw, 1/12/12Publisher of BagNewsNotes, topping LIFE.com\u0027s 2011 Best Photo BlogsI honestly don\u0027t understand the pixelization.Read Post | Comments (20)Christopher Hitchens, 1/12/12The late journalist, author, essayist.In this lost essay by the late Christopher Hitchens he reveals his penchant for right-wing women. It is a brilliant, perfect jewel of an essay on politics and sexuality by a great writer.Read Post | Comments (13)Gary Hart, 1/12/12President, Hart International, Ltd.The shift from traditional capitalism to money culture is pretty well-known. What is surprising is that it is now being discovered and strongly criticized by Republican leaders who, up to now, have been silent on this transformation of American capitalism.Read Post | CommentsMaria Bello, 1/12/12ActressHaiti is not just \"rebuilding\" with cement and muscle. Haiti is \"reimagining\" a nation, with a bold vision and collective dream.Read Post | Comments (12)Steve Clemons, 1/12/12Publisher, \u0027The Washington Note\u0027Whether many want to admit it or not, what our soldiers allegedly did -- urinating on dead Taliban militants -- represents \"us\" today; and that\u0027s yet another part of the malignant manifestation of these current conflicts.Read Post | Comments (80)Deepak Chopra, 1/12/12Author, \u0027War of the Worldviews\u0027; Founder, The Chopra FoundationThe point isn\u0027t that you have to believe the positive and ignore the negative. The two sides are intimately linked and inescapable. But you can align yourself with the positive side. The vote is cast at the level of consciousness.Read Post | Comments (23)Donna Karan, 1/11/12Fashion designer, humanitarianIt\u0027s hard to believe it\u0027s been two years. When the earthquake struck Haiti, it had a ripple effect that changed countless lives, including mine. I\u0027ve discovered a new purpose, to be an ambassador -- a cheerleader -- for this country.Read Post | CommentsRobert Scheer, 1/12/12Editor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027As the presidential election is now shaping up, voters will not be given a choice to rebuke Wall Street by either major party. Expect razor-thin differences between Romney and Obama on the key issues at the heart of our economic crisis.Read Post | Comments (70)Soleil Moon Frye, 1/12/12Actress, Author, EntrepreneurIt would be easy to spend today reliving the tragedy of January 12, 2010, but if there is one thing I learned during my trips to Haiti over the past year, the best way to mark today\u0027s milestone would be to celebrate the progress that has been made.Read Post | CommentsBob Cesca, 1/11/12Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez Show, Media ProducerPeople who are devoted to Ron Paul appear to be more interested in the fantastical, fictitious idea of President Ron Paul than the realistic manifestation of President Ron Paul.Read Post | Comments (2,403)Obery M. Hendricks, Jr., Ph.D., 1/12/12Author of The Universe Bends Toward Justice: the Bible, the Church and the Body Politic (Orbis, 2010)Yet I must admit that there is something about Mitt Romney\u0027s religion that I find deeply troubling. ...

But there are many myths about the program that poison the public perception of it.Read Post | Comments (27)Dan Collins, 1/12/12New York Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostOf course you\u0027ve never seen a State of the City speech. If the mayor expected you to care about it, he wouldn\u0027t do it in the middle of the afternoon. But there is a nice tea-leaf quality to this annual ritual. You can get a sense of what the Big Man really wants us to pay attention to.Read Post | CommentsMeghan O\u0027Keefe, 1/12/12Comedian and writerYou might be saying, \"You can\u0027t do a spin-off of Friends! Know why? Because they tried it!
