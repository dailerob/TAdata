{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"From visualparadox.comFrom msnbc.comTime magazine spent millions of dollars to protect a confidence. Matt Cooper had his bags packed and was ready to head off to jail to do the same. Viveca Novak broke the confidence for the price of a cocktail -- blurting it out to her buddy like a drunken sailor. And after all that, she is put on leave? Why not a big wet kiss and a hefty Christmas bonus to go along with it? For God\u0027s sake, what is it going to take before one of these Plamegate journalistic malefactors is handed a pink slip?READ POST | comments (82)12.14.2005 Jay RosenFroomkin\u0027s column is popular; it isn\u0027t going away. (Users do have some power in the equation.) John Harris knows that. He told me he is not on any campaign to sink the column.READ POST | comments (21)12.14.2005 Jane HamsherIn the 90s, the Post dedicated teams of crack reporters to charting the incremental movements of Bill Clinton\u0027s jock. Now they whine about their need to play White House lapdog for the purpose of maintaining \"access.\"READ POST | comments (17)12.14.2005 Robert ScheerThe more we learn of the Bush administration\u0027s pervasive outsourcing of torture, the more sensible it seems as a policy. Evidently, our intelligence people are just not fully up to the task of getting prisoners to tell us what the administration wants us to hear.READ POST | comments (20)12.13.2005 Harry ShearerSheet pilings from areas directly adjacent to the part of the 17th St. Canal floodwall that breached following Katrina were in fact the length specified in the plans.READ POST | comments (19)12.13.2005 RJ EskowHow can we kill unjustly without proof that it will ever save a life? I should shorten that sentence. \"How can we kill unjustly?\" Or, even better -- \"How can we kill?\"READ POST | comments (52)12.13.2005 Greg GutfeldLook, if we\u0027re going to execute a man because he wrote children\u0027s books, then who\u0027s next?READ POST | comments (78)12.13.2005 Byron WilliamsWhy should the governor see redemption as a reason for clemency when there is no consistent public outcry against the possibility of executing the innocent?READ POST | comments (26)12.13.2005 Aaron FreemanHussein has not yet called judge a \"fascist dog\" but he is every bit as proud, defiant and smart as the founder of the Black Panther party.

Wal*Mart can do better in lots of areas. But on balance, it is a positive economic and social force.READ POST | comments (73)12.13.2005 Marty KaplanIf the Post’s ombudsman has swallowed the right-wing canard that telling the truth is “liberal,” then journalism might as well check into the hospice.READ POST | comments (37)12.13.2005 Jane HamsherThe WaPo has handed the keys to the kingdom to the village idiots and they shouldn\u0027t be stunned when bloggers merely point that out.READ POST | comments (53)12.13.2005 Naomi FonerHow different in the end is our governor from Tookie Williams? Yesterday he committed murder and by his own report he feels no remorse.READ POST | comments (97)12.13.2005 Michael SmerconishIn denying clemency for Stanley “Tookie” Williams, Schwarzenegger cited Williams’ support of convicted cop killer Abu-Jamal, among others, as an indication of Williams’ lack of repentance while behind bars.READ POST | comments (48)12.13.2005 Mark KleimanUnless bloggers can somehow attract the attention of mainstream media outlets, or of the politicians whose statements they will treat as news then the story is going to die, and so, probably, is Cory Maye.READ POST | comments (18)12.13.2005 Danielle CrittendenKickass43: I’m sick of xmas parties Partygrrl1600: “holiday receptions” sir Kickass43: whatvr Kickass43: theyr BOR-INGREAD POST | comments12.12.2005 Michael VlahosWe Americans look at Iraq through the lens of a \"legitimate\" government under attack by illegitimate groups.
