{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027At a time many Republican presidential candidates and state legislators are furiously focusing on private morality -- what people do in their bedrooms, contraception, abortion, gay marriage -- America is experiencing a far more significant crisis in public morality. CEOs of large corporations now earn 300 times the wages of average workers. Insider trading is endemic on Wall Street, where hedge-fund and private-equity moguls are taking home hundreds of millions. A handful of extraordinarily wealthy people are investing unprecedented sums in the upcoming election, seeking to rig the economy for their benefit even more than it\u0027s already rigged.Dr. Michael Breus is a clinical psychologist and author of The Sleep Doctor\u0027s Diet Plan: Lose Weight Through Better Sleep. In answer to my questions, he shared his thoughts on the major obstacles to getting a good night\u0027s sleep, the steps you can take to improve your sleep, and the future of sleep technology.We know that government action can bring down the rate of maternal deaths because we see it happening everywhere around the world. Everywhere, that is, but here. We have a lot of catching up to do.President, National Organization for WomenAttacks on women\u0027s self-determination in body, mind and spirit are a staple of our political life because they work. Unless and until we confront the root reasons why patterns of violence against women work, both overt and covert violence against women will continue to be a political mainstay.Professor of Theology, Chicago Theological SeminaryThe Kim Davis situation raises interesting questions about the meaning and practical effect of the freedom of religion. Although, for reasons that I will explain, the issue today is one of public policy, rather than constitutional law, the evolution of constitutional principles in this realm is illuminating.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoAs a member of the European Parliament, what bothers me most is that even now, with the biggest refugee crisis since WWII knocking on Europe\u0027s doors, the E.U. doesn\u0027t seem to be conscious of its magnitude. Worse still, it doesn\u0027t want to be conscious of it.Deputy of Podemos, and member of European ParliamentThis is the world of Grandma Minnie, the Brooklyn of my youth, full of wonders and windows as far as I could see, out of which countless heads would lean and call for children I didn\u0027t really know.Author, New York Times bestseller \u0027The Book of Awakening\u0027New York has long been overdo for a Sarah Charlesworth retrospective. Throughout the summer of 2015, the New Museum filled the void with Doubleword a partial-survey of Charlesworth\u0027s work curated by Massimiliano Gioni and Margot Norton, a most welcome arrival.Cultural critic, essayist and novelist published with Parkett, Art in America and Bijutsu TechoLabor Day is a time for honoring the working people of this country. It is a time to celebrate the accomplishments of the activists and organizers who fought for the 40-hour work week, occupational safety protection and other workplace rights. These working people resisted the oligarchs of their day, fought for a more responsive democracy, and built the middle class.U.S. Senator from VermontI am so terribly sorry that you have received such horrible reactions from people, and that you have been under such intense scrutiny. Rude behavior is never justified. But as an educator, I would like to ask that you take a few moments to think about the way you read the Bible.Biblical scholar, author, professor, speaker, permissiongrantedthebook.comAs with marriage reform, the bulk of the action with marijuana legalization has been at the state level, with most members of Congress hesitant to express support until public opinion moves well past the tipping point. This is starting to change.Executive director, Marijuana Policy ProjectWhile the refugee and migrant crisis is an existential problem for Europe, it is also a huge opportunity. The way it is handled will critically impact not only the future of Europe, but also its identity -- the European ethos -- economics, demographics and indeed (don\u0027t be scared!) culture.Managing Director, Center for Transatlantic Relations (CTR), Johns Hopkins UniversityAt the end of this month, thousands of representatives from all over the world will gather in New York. They will witness the launch of the most ambitious universal effort since the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. It is a threshold moment.United Nations Under-Secretary-General and Executive Director, UN WomenThe news business has devolved into just another branch of the entertainment business. Many are well aware of this. Few, though, appreciate the degree to which even the elite media -- e.g., The New York Times -- contribute to the phenomenon.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghCooperation must be based on trust in order to be effective. And because the United States is still the biggest kid on the block, we must take the initiative in quieting the China-bashing rhetoric to begin the transition to a trusting and genuinely cooperative relationship.Confucian scholarThere are plenty of things wrong with the labor movement. It can be overly bureaucratic. There are corrupt officials in many unions. But there should be no doubt that the country is much better off as a result of the labor movement and prospects for progressive change would be brighter if it were stronger.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Black Lives Matter is far from a perfect organization, but contrary to what the conservative media would have you believe, the only special treatment BLM is asking for is to not be treated special.Political blogger, Detroit NewsNo doubt, the bombastic Donald is an unlikely president. Yet what may be most extraordinary about his campaign is that on foreign policy, at least, he may be the most sensible Republican in the race.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteGay men need to stop perpetuating misogyny and ally themselves with the feminist movement. And the first step toward becoming a true ally is listening to women speak about the issues that are important to them, whether it\u0027s wage equality, reproductive rights, access to birth control or anything else.Voices Editorial FellowKentucky Clerk Kim Davis Becomes an Anti-Gay Martyr; Huckabee, Cruz and Eric Erickerick Rush to Davis\u0027 Defense; Rand Paul\u0027s App is Spying on You; Trump Attacks Jeb Bush for Speaking Spanish; and much more.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027A Romney candidacy will starkly reveal the problems the GOP faces in 2016, and they are much bigger than the mercurial Trump. The GOP has become the vehicle for a set of ideas that American voters will reject in the general election, no matter who is the standard bearer.Senior Fellow, DemosAmericans are looking to corporate citizens to embrace their responsibilities to workers and the public. The enormous popularity of minimum wage increases and anti-wage theft measures are a powerful barometer of this desire, and one that Uber and other sharing economy players would do well to heed.Partner in Union-Side Law Firm Bush, GottliebIn thinking through the hundreds of breakups I\u0027ve seen on this show, I\u0027ve learned so much about how to dump someone. And listen, take your, \"but they aren\u0027t even real relationships on this show\" nonsense elsewhere; everyone is allowed to feel deeply in any setting where they make themselves vulnerable for a love interest.Writer, reader, worshiper of Beyoncé. Musings at alicemcalex.comWhile many other sustainability challenges will remain, the tide of climate change will literally be reversed. This will free us to focus on other challenges such as the widespread use of toxic substances throughout our economy. There is a great deal riding on Jerry Brown and California\u0027s ambitious climate program.Executive Director, Columbia University\u0027s Earth InstituteIf we are going to prepare our students for the global marketplace, we must address the challenges minority students face, find ways to keep them in high school, and then support their transition to higher education--whether traditional four year college or vocational training.President Kuepa.com Blended Learning in LatinamericaAkbar Ganji, one of Iran\u0027s known political reformists, recently made a petition regarding the Iranian nuclear agreement, which has been signed by some prominent and respectable intellectuals. But it contains some questionable arguments which need to be addressed if the reactions to the agreement are to be understood.Political sociologist, writer, democracy activistChoose ATMs wisely, assess them for any signs of tampering, and shield the PIN pad as you type your number. Those steps do not guarantee that your debit card information won\u0027t be compromised, but you can make it as difficult as possible for criminals. They are likely to move on to an easier target.MoneyTips.com is an online community and information resource.Every year I speak to the families of new students at Wesleyan University just before they say goodbye and we start our semester.

Every year at this time, movie makers all across the globe reveal new big screen narratives that reflect on, shape and shift culture.Founder \u0026 CEO of Humanise, Inc and Executive Director of TheToolbox.orgMuch of the news coverage of Lessig has treated him more as a concept than as an individual. Even if his bid is a long-shot, he is breaking all the political rules, and he might just make an impact. Voters should know who he is and what he wants to do.Adjunct professor of journalism, ethics and interactive media at Emerson College in Boston.According to a recent CBS poll , voters see Donald Trump as different from his opponents in the presidential race because he is candid. He says what he thinks, and he means what he says. But in two obvious ways, Trump is anything but candid.Award-winning author of What We\u0027re Up Against, former Democratic nominee for Congress in Virginia, political commentator and talk radio philosopherGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
