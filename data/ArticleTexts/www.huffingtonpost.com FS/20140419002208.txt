{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundNew York City received a lot of attention recently with a bold promise made to some of its youngest residents: Mayor Bill de Blasio ran on a campaign to fund full-day public preschool for all New York City children through a modest increased income tax on residents making more than $500,000 a year. Although Mayor de Blasio\u0027s tax proposal was not approved by the state legislature or supported by New York\u0027s Governor Andrew Cuomo, the legislature did approve statewide funding for pre-K that included a $300 million increase for New York City\u0027s preschool program.

HewittAuthor, JewishTreats.orgRather than using the Mimi and Nikko sex tape as a teachable moment about privacy, permanence and the longevity of Internet decisions, Harvey can\u0027t resist transforming that moment into a diatribe about shame and God\u0027s plan for women\u0027s bodies.Olivia ColePoet, author, and activistThe culture that marginalizes women is largely the product of men.
