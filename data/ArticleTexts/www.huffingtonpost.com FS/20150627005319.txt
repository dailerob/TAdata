{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Executive Editor Of Global Spirituality and Religion, The Huffington PostI am rejoicing today, and ecstatic that in the years to come, the love that I share with my husband and the love that millions of other LGBT Americans experience will be honored and that LGBT people will have gained dignity and justice at last. And yet, today my heart is also despairing. On this great day of celebration, there is also a funeral and great mourning of the loss of the life of Rev. Clementa Pinckney and eight other African-Americans who were shot in Charleston. For those nine African-Americans, the church was also their sanctuary. And Mother Emanuel AME was a church where, throughout its history, African-Americans were afforded full human dignity when the outside world wanted to enslave them. That sacred sanctuary was brutally violated just days ago by a twisted, sick shooter and today, we mourn the loss of \"The Beautiful Nine.\"As luck would have it in The Huffington Post\u0027s New York headquarters, the nearest hippie happened to be the world\u0027s most famous hippie, David Crosby, who, like Joplin, performed at Woodstock. So ask him we did: what did he think of Justice Scalia\u0027s line of thinking?Executive Special Projects Editor, The Huffington PostWhile those of us who support marriage equality are right to rejoice, there remains one thing missing from Justice Anthony Kennedy\u0027s opinion: he refused (once again) to say that all laws that discriminate against LGBT people are subject to heightened judicial scrutiny.Professor of Law, UCLAThe United Nations at 70 can look back on a proud record of working with many partners to dismantle colonialism, triumph over apartheid, keep the peace in troubled places and articulate a body of treaties and law to safeguard human rights.Secretary-General, United NationsThe U.S. Supreme Court ruled today that same-sex couples will soon have the freedom to marry and equal respect for their marriages across America. This ruling will bring joy to families, and final victory to the decades-long marriage movement. Here are some of the lessons learned over the years that could apply to other progressive social movements.National Campaign Director, Freedom to Marry; author, \u0027Winning Marriage\u0027In my 32 years serving the people of California in Congress, I have never written to Supreme Court Justices. But your ruling in the King v. Burwell case was so momentous and so important for America\u0027s families, I felt compelled to write and share my gratitude for this decision.Senior Member of the Senate Foreign Relations CommitteeI just can\u0027t vibe with one aspect of my existence being uplifted while another piece is reminded of its inhumanity every single day. I can\u0027t focus on something like marriage, or living boldly and proudly, when I need to focus on keeping myself and those like me alive.Southern bird of paradiseAs the final round of nuclear negotiations begins here in Vienna, opponents of a deal have become schizophrenic in their efforts to torpedo it. Unable to base their objections on science or the technical facts currently being drafted, they have instead resorted to a loose mélange of poorly constructed straw men. Here are five such myths.Research Director, National Iranian American CouncilWhat the Supreme Court did not do today was offer LGBT people heightened protection for their status in other circumstances, as it has done with race and gender. That victory remains for another day. Whatever happens later, however, history will remember Justice Kennedy\u0027s words, and his role as a key proponent for the rights of the LGBT community.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityIt remains to be seen if this racial atrocity will awaken the soul of white America and create a multiracial commitment against the lingering sins of systemic racism. Will the continuing racial injustice in America now be more forthrightly addressed -- by all of us? That will be the moral test of white America\u0027s soul.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersHot Girls Wanted is, more than anything, an invitation to reflect on how well porn\u0027s rhetoric of empowerment stacks up against the reality of its practices and products. If it is true that the vast majority of porn lives up to the promise of liberating, consensual fantasy, there is nothing to fear in this invitation.Professor of Law, University of Miami School of Law; Legislative \u0026 Tech Policy Director, Cyber Civil Rights InitiativeAs I\u0027ve said many times over the last several years, marriage equality had the stamp of inevitability on it -- it is not a matter or \"if,\" but \"when.\" Today, we know the answer: Marriage equality is here.U.S. Representative for Illinois\u0027s 9th congressional districtAs momentous as today\u0027s historic decision is, we must now harness the momentum from marriage conversation to the work of securing additional advances towards equality, especially nondiscrimination protections for LGBT Americans. But today, we celebrate.Episcopal priest and activist from Pasadena, Calif.I have long argued that global warming is the moral issue of our time. President Obama has said the same. I am now thrilled that Pope Francis, spiritual and moral leader of 1.2 billion Catholics, has not just agreed, but has gone so much further.Author of Don\u0027t Think of an Elephant! | UC Berkeley Professor of Linguistics | Founder of Reframe AmericaHere are the activists who have helped us get here. LGBT people are still not fully equal under the law, but these 10 amazing individuals took great strides to get us a little bit closer.Writer, librarian, feminist, ultrarunnerThings are about to get weird. After months of hearing from conservatives and fundamentalists about how they were going to secede, leave the country, or burn themselves in effigy over same-sex marriage, the day has arrived.Richard Zombeck is a freelance writer for hire and a contributor to www.nowitcounts.comThere are many things that dads can do to support the development of egalitarian attitudes at home, like take parental leave or equally absorb chores, but what men need is for other men to stop shaming them when they do those things.Feminist, writer, and satirist (not always in that order)To be perceived as \"responsible,\" a business must be authentic and have values that influence everything it does -- from how it treats employees and uses natural resources to how it operates within the community and down their supply chain.Making capitalism more equitable, sustainable, and inclusiveOur fight for civil and human rights for the LGBT community goes on. Marriage equality is only one rung in the ladder to victory. Bigger battles are yet to be fought and won. We cannot accept that you can marry today and, in 29 states, lose your job tomorrow.Political consultantIn the wake of today\u0027s Supreme Court ruling, which upheld a key pillar of Obamacare, the Republican Party has announced that it is firing Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote the opinion for the majority.Novelist, Amnesia, Milrose Munce, GalunkerIs this a thing that happens? Do people come out -- or come back out -- as cis? How do you celebrate that? Unbake a cake? Re-wrap the gifts? Or do you mourn it? Do you shake your head at the person you thought you knew before shuffling back to your respective safe spaces, crestfallen?There\u0027s no wrong way to be a woman.If one does what one can do to make the world a better place, that\u0027s all God will ask... it is a job that can make your life worth living, no matter what else happens.Former Governor of New YorkOne of Hollywood\u0027s most respected character actors, Bates has been able to achieve success in an industry that is notoriously biased against certain age groups and image types. In this clip, she shares when she learned to develop tough skin in order to deal with what can often be an insensitive business.PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorThe whole King v. Burwell episode is a reminder that we live in a period of highly constrained rationality, where facts are too often on the run, and simple common sense is a cause for celebration.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorMuch of what made up the air I breathed as a little white girl growing up in lower Alabama was revisionist history. The \"South\" that I love and have been desperately homesick for doesn\u0027t really exist.Math teacher. Displaced Southerner. Conversationalist.For many people, the difficulties start before stepping foot in the store.Inspiring cooks. Nourishing homes.In contrast to Clinton, Sanders has supported the issue of gay marriage since 2000, vehemently opposed the Iraq War, opposes TPP, wants student loan debt reforms, fights for veterans, and isn\u0027t afraid to blast \"too big to fail\" Wall Street firms.Columnist and author published in The Hill, The Baltimore Sun, The Jerusalem Post, Salon, and other publicationsPresident Obama not only expended his own \"political capital\" by pushing for fast-track but that of the Democratic Party too. He had a clear choice: either side with workers, environmentalists, consumers, and progressives -- or side with Wall Street, Big Pharma, Wal-Mart, and the Koch Brothers.Professor, historian, authorLike the curly hair versus straight hair conundrum, women with large breasts wish they had smaller breasts, and women with smaller breasts wish they had larger breasts. But unlike the little boob problems, there are some serious disadvantages of having large boobies.Writer. Blogger. Babysitter by day. Managing editor for Mommy Drinks Wine and Swears© by night.The steady erosion of sociopolitical conditions, the growing restrictions on free speech and the pervasiveness of the governing Justice and Development (AK) Party created deep anxiety and fear among the general public as they witnessed the gradual transformation of their country from a democracy to a police state.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUNothing says summer more than burgers sizzling on the grill.
