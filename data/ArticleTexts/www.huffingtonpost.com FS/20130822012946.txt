{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonEditor-in-chief, Huffington Post Media GroupSince launching our Third Metric campaign -- to redefine success beyond money and power to include well-being, wisdom, our ability to wonder and to give back -- I\u0027ve been seeing things through a Third Metric lens. And what I see is a split-screen world. On one side, we have endless examples of how the business world still hasn\u0027t changed and continues to glorify an approach to measuring success that leads to burnout. On the other side of the screen, there are more and more examples from companies large and small of prioritizing well-being. One of the primary things keeping many businesses from adopting more sustainable metrics of success is the stubborn -- and dangerously wrongheaded -- myth that prioritizing health and well-being is incompatible with a healthy bottom line; and that there is a trade-off between high performance and taking care of ourselves. As countless studies show, this couldn\u0027t be less true.CommentsDiane RavitchHistorian, NYU professorMega-corporations believe they must continually reinvent themselves in order to have the latest, best thing and beat their competitors, who are about to overtake them in the market. City after city is now suffering a \"disruptive\" assault on public education.Comments (53)Wendell PotterAuthor, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgFolks in Florida are facing having to pay far more for health insurance over the next two years than necessary. And health insurance executives will be laughing all the way to the bank.Comments (912)David WildTV Writer; Contributing Editor, Rolling Stone; Co-Author, \u0027Diary of a Player\u0027By virtue of his genius as a writer and the fact that he became a fascinatingly elusive character in his own right, J.D. Salinger remains, even after his death, an absolute somebody. In the weeks ahead, Salinger is posthumously making the kind of splash that he resisted most of his life.CommentsAnita MoorjaniBestselling author of \u0027Dying to Be Me\u0027Many of us are taught from a young age to \"love our neighbors as we love ourselves.\" But learning to love others begins with learning to love ourselves unconditionally first. This seems to be a well-kept secret, which no one taught me as I was growing up.Comments (95)Katie HurleyChild and Adolescent Psychotherapist, Parenting ExpertLife is far too scripted today. Plans are made. Classes are attended. Craft projects are intended to mimic those found on Pinterest. Gone are the days of free play and creating something out of nothing. Many kids today are simply following a script.Comments (363)Paul StollerProfessor of Anthropology, West Chester University; Author, \u0027The Power of the Between\u0027As a society we seem to no longer place high value in scientific knowledge, intellectual excellence or, for that matter, artistic creativity -- three elements that have heretofore contributed to the greatness of our society. Can we get back on track?Comments (436)Leah KellerFounder and CEO of The Dia MethodThe same exercises that deliver firm, flat abs to my postnatal clients have also worked wonders to help my male clients -- including athletes and body builders -- to repair separated abs for tighter six-packs and narrower waists.Comments (26)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureIt\u0027s easy to retreat into the idleness of the cynic, to become the kind of person essayist Sydney J. Harris once described as \"prematurely disappointed in the future.\" It\u0027s easy -- and it\u0027s a mistake.Comments (100)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarBy allowing Vogue to play up her assets in such an undeniably -- and distractingly -- physical way, Marissa Mayer lost the opportunity to make the case for herself, and for other women, that she is far more than a pretty woman in a blue dress.Comments (43)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributor\"I wouldn\u0027t want Larry Summers to mow my yard.\" That little gem was uttered Monday by Senator Pat Roberts in what has to be a fight the White House really doesn\u0027t want to have right now.Comments (68)Ethan RomeExecutive Director, Health Care for America NowCruz\u0027s stated goal is that he wants to repeal Obamacare. His extortionary crusade will hurt millions of people and seriously disrupt our economy. But Cruz doesn\u0027t care.Comments (24)Pastor Rick HendersonPastor, blogger and grace addictWhen I was a kid I could tell the difference between the kids who wanted to be my friend from the kids who were my friends so that they could play with my toys. Joel and Joyce are the latter. They preach a twisted form of Christianity that teaches obedience, giving and faith as a way to get things from God.Comments (218)Jason SattlerExecutive Editor, NationalMemo.com -- @LOLGOP on TwitterThe truth of the situation -- that the GOP lost its last chance to stop Obamacare in 2012 -- is too painful for the Republican base to accept. That\u0027s why they donate money every time the House passes a meaningless Obamacare repeal. That\u0027s why the House is still banning ACORN for the 13th time in 2013, even though it shut down in 2010.Comments (111)Krystie YandoliWriterI stood at my kitchen table as everyone surrounded me, singing, \"Happy Birthday.\" I blew out the candles and made a wish -- a wish I don\u0027t remember -- just like I do every year. The next day I found out a close friend of mine, another 22-year-old, passed away.CommentsMatt CrabtreeOwner of 21 CrossFit in Durham, NCThe body is amazingly tough at handling abuse. But do something a hundred times, do it regularly, do it when you are tired, when your shoulders are already sore... something is going to give. Something. Is going. To give.CommentsRobert ScheerEditor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027Sixty years ago this week the United States successfully staged a coup in Iran to overthrow democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh that a newly declassified CIA document reveals was designed to preserve the control of Western companies over Iran\u0027s rich oil fields.Comments (323)Meryl HartsteinPublished author of \"Shine\"Pros and cons of dating a younger man! Let\u0027s be honest, the main reason a woman will date a younger man is because physically it\u0027s very appealing. But there could be more than meets the eye. Here are four good reasons to allow yourself to jump into the kiddie pool.Comments (188)Mitch HorowitzEditor-in-chief, Tarcher/Penguin, author of Occult America (Bantam) and One Simple Idea: How Positive Thinking Reshaped Modern Life (Crown, Jan 2014))he visuals of The Twilight Zone form a kind of collective generational nightmare. The remarkable thing about the man who created many of these episodes from 1959 to 1964, Rod Serling, is that the writer-presenter learned his craft not in the visual era but in the age of radio drama.CommentsDean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Summers had ample opportunity in his prior jobs to demonstrate a commitment to rein in the financial sector. All the evidence shows he pushed in the opposite direction.Comments (299)Tess MunsterPlus size model, make up artist, blogger, activistModeling, and especially living your life in the public eye, is by far the hardest thing I\u0027ve ever done. We are breeding a generation of young girls and guys who think their worth is based on their looks and how many \"likes\" they get. You can say \"It\u0027s always been this way,\" but I can tell you, it hasn\u0027t.Comments (17)Kyle McMahonRecording artist known as K.MacAre the critics right? Has Lady Gaga\u0027s time as a polarizing and powerful pop force come to an end? The fact that they are still talking about her means she isn\u0027t going anywhere anytime soon.Comments (13)Murray FromsonFromsonfile.comThe arrival of Al Jazeera has been a refreshing reminder of what journalism as a whole can do, be it print, on the air or a growing method of digital communication.Comments (26)Ashley RyanMommy Advocate and Founder, Life Balance CommunityI spent many years living in the shadow of the perfect woman. When we put energy into being what we\u0027re not, we often lose precious people and moments along the way. Moments we can never get back -- and sometimes relationships that can\u0027t be mended.CommentsDr. Yvonne Bohn, Dr. Allison Hill \u0026 Dr. Alane ParkOB/GYNs and authors of The Mommy Docs\u0027 Ultimate Guide to Pregnancy and BirthCollege comes with big life changes that you need to be prepared for, but it\u0027s important to pay respect to your vagina as well.Comments (150)Rachel WeightI\u0027m all for adventure, going out of my comfort zone, and pushing limits, but I also feel freedom in declaring things I don\u0027t want to do and will not be pressured into doing.Comments (115)Lauren DucaFellow, The Huffington PostThe recent paparazzi shots of North West draped in a blanket are so indistinguishable that they could be photos of any other baby. They could be photos of a small cat or rhesus monkey. And yet, the media is predictably freaking out.Comments (24)Julie FoucherMed student, CrossFit Games athleteLadies, whether it\u0027s looking toward the top of the podium at the CrossFit Games, a stellar exam score, a career change, or a job promotion, let\u0027s set our goals high this year and refuse to allow a lack of belief in ourselves to hold us back. Who\u0027s with me?CommentsLisa BelkinSenior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, The Huffington PostWhy do I care? Let’s start by admitting that I do. I watched that door of the Lindo Wing of St. Mary\u0027s Hospital in London for the first glimpse of the new family. I cooed at the new Prince’s little Royal Wave.Comments (129)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkJustice delayed is justice denied. And a dream deferred is a dream unfulfilled.Comments (108)Allison TateWriter, mother of fourThere\u0027s no way to fast forward or take a shortcut when we give a moment to our kids; there\u0027s no app for that. That\u0027s what makes it special.Comments (55)John Dear, 2013.21.08Chris Weigant, 2013.21.08David Wild, 2013.21.08Dr. Lawrence M.
