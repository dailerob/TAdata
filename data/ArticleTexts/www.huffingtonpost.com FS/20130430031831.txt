{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesThe magnitude of NBA player Jason Collins\u0027 coming out today cannot be overestimated. He breaks a barrier that we\u0027ve been waiting for someone to plunge through: a major league sports player saying \"I\u0027m gay\" while still playing and at the height of his career. We\u0027ve seen former major league football players and others come out after retirement, but until now, no one has dared say it while still playing major league sports. There\u0027s been enormous progress on LGBT rights in the courts and in the public opinion polls, yet for all that progress it\u0027s still true that no leading man or woman in Hollywood, the kind of people who, like it or not, are idolized by young people in our culture, has dared come out of the closet. And that was true of the world of professional sports until today.Comments (96)Elizabeth DrewJournalistThe nonsense about what it takes for a president to win a victory in Congress has reached ridiculous dimensions. The fact that Barack Obama failed to win legislation to place further curbs on the purchase of guns has made people who ought to know better decide that he\u0027s not an \"arm-twister.Comments (302)Jay PlattMotivational keynote speaker, Coach, AuthorI guess I could have just gone home and taken it easy, as was recommended to me by most medical experts. They\u0027d told me that my best years were far behind me; that I\u0027d never be able to do the kind of things I once had. But I chose to not listen to all of that.Comments (9)Paul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostCollins\u0027 experience refutes the polarity we hear so much of, that to be religious is to be anti-gay or to be gay is to be anti-religious.Comments (102)Carrie GoldmanAuthor, BULLIED: What Every Parent, Teacher, and Kid Needs to Know About Ending the Cycle of FearThere is a little-told secret among those of us who adopt or have trouble building a family -- we feel as if we should be grateful for every minute every second of every hour for our children, as if we never have the right to feel overwhelmed by the tasks of parenting.Comments (280)Sally OsbergCEO, Skoll FoundationCommentsMichael HoganExecutive Arts and Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post Media GroupNobody\u0027s quite sure who Jon Snow is serving, but Ygritte intends to find out, wasting no time executing the nudity clause in actress Rose Leslie\u0027s contract. I loved the part where she asks him, \"Why are you still dressed?\" Ygritte, have you been watching this show?Comments (222)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Reinhart and Rogoff seem to be correct in one basic respect: Economic growth does seem to be lower in very-high-debt countries. But the entire debate over their paper\u0027s flaws begs the central question of cause and effect. Is growth lower because of the high debt? Or does cause-and-effect the other way around?Comments (219)Aaron ZelinskyVisiting Assistant Professor, University of Maryland School of LawSI\u0027s feigned ignorance of the bigotry in its comments thread this morning is unfair to Collins. To portray the reaction as uniformly feel-good cheapens what Collins did today. It also misrepresents how much remains to be done, socially and politically, on equal rights.CommentsIngrid NewkirkPresident and co-founder, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA)Recently, PETA and other shelters who never turn animals away have been attacked by those who deny the heartbreaking crisis animals face because of casual acquisition and the lack of spaying and neutering laws. Let me paint faces on some of the real people who bear the toll of this vitriol.Comments (100)Sara ZambrelliTherapistWhen I am in touch with my most authentic self, I am not engaged in the bottomless pit that is social media. When I am busy being myself, I am not looking over my shoulder to see what other people have or what they are doing or what they like.Comments (28)Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027It\u0027s been a very bad week for the merchants of austerity. In Europe, the just-released statistics on first quarter performance show EU nations sliding deeper into recession. In Spain and Greece, unemployment rates are approaching a staggering 30 percent.Comments (651)Marty KaplanDirector, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolI thought that President Obama and Conan O\u0027Brien were both really funny at this year\u0027s White House Correspondents\u0027 Dinner. But whatever barbs they tossed were easily accommodated by the soothing meta-fiction machine that the whole incestuous enterprise amounts to.Comments (11)Jonah BergerAuthor, \u0027Contagious: Why Things Catch On\u0027We often get sucked into trivial decisions. Here are 3 ways to avoid this painful phenomenon.CommentsJohn PavleyCTO @ The Huffington Post, BloggerIn 2009, my friend Mike was getting into bitcoin and I remember him explaining the whole concept to me: A virtual currency managed by a peer-to-peer network open to anyone with a computer and uncontrolled by any bank or government.Comments (67)Devon CornealLawyer, MotherThe best way to avoid stress is to surround yourself with loving and supportive people. Nothing else even comes close.CommentsLeo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersYou are not safe. Not at work. Not at home in your bed. The biggest threat is not terrorism. It\u0027s corporate negligence leading to a blast or collapse or release of toxic chemicals.Comments (227)Council for Adult and Experiential LearningAs Benjamin Franklin so famously noted - and to which many will certainly agree -- time is money. On the flipside, many will readily declare that money is time. But what happens when you\u0027re a student going after a degree, and you can\u0027t afford much in the way of time and/or money?CommentsCody TresierraPainterAn artist with a disability shares many of the same experiences as other artists. We do, however, struggle with ideas and how to convey them on a canvas.CommentsEdward Jay EpsteinAuthor, \u0027The Annals of Unsolved Crime\u0027Amanda Knox is facing yet another murder trial in Italy for a crime of which she was found innocent. The revival of the baseless charges against Knox, and the tabloid frenzy it will no doubt stoke, proceeds from a five-year-long judicial circus in Italy.Comments (393)Michael RothPresident, Wesleyan UniversityDavid Nirenberg\u0027s Anti-Judaism is a thorough, scholarly account of why, in the history of the West, Jews have been so easy to hate. And this story goes back a very long way.Comments (177)Molly LindquistFounder, ConsanoFor me, one of the scariest parts of my diagnosis with breast cancer was the challenge of keeping life as normal as possible for my two young daughters.Comments (15)Olivia Culpo and Nana MeriwetherOur experiences as Miss Universe and Miss USA instill within us a global outlook. That\u0027s what the Global Mom Relay speaks to -- women and men and children coming together in support of solutions for moms and kids that will benefit us all.CommentsAlexander SangerChair, International Planned Parenthood CouncilSeveral U.S. states are falling over themselves -- and in some cases failing -- to ban abortion, abortion clinics and access to the few clinics that remain. This is not a new phenomenon.Comments (216)Rabbi Shmuley BoteachRabbi and WriterI do not know Rabbi Broyde and cannot recall if we ever formally met. But I do know this. The growing American and Jewish culture of \u0027one-strike-and-your-out\u0027 is tragic and disturbing.Comments (23)Ban Ki-moonSecretary-General, United NationsMalaria continues to inflict a major toll on least developed countries -- primarily in Africa -- and millions of people still lack access to life-saving interventions. In Africa, malaria kills a child every minute.Comments (15)Michael ChaseStudent Support Coordinator, Northshore AcademyI jumped on top of my wife to cover her. I remember yelling directions at Lauren. We were able to scramble into a safe position. All the while my brother was still on the phone screaming at me to tell him what happened. All I could muster to him was \"Get out of the city!\"CommentsChris KluweNFL player, Minnesota VikingsWhy do I speak out in support of the gay community? Because the words, \"We should round them all up and send them to an island to die,\" are absolutely abhorrent to any rational-minded person and should never be uttered by one member of the human race about another.Comments (257)James FrancoActor and authorMacbeth with Alan Cumming: another dazzling and brilliant one-person show. Yes, Macbeth as a one-man show, a portrayal of Macbeth by a man losing his mind in an institution. Cumming is superb.CommentsMohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOExpect next week\u0027s policy meetings to signal that central bank stand ready to step in, once again, to maintain the disconnect between buoyant equity markets and sluggish economic conditions -- not as an end in itself but, given Congressional dysfunction, as virtually the only way today to support economic activity.Comments (215)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorEarly cognitive development is so determinative of what happens later that to continue the tired squabble about who to blame -- teachers, schools, or the income distribution -- is to waste valuable time.Comments (62)Ellen SeidmanBlogger, Love That MaxSo often our kids\u0027 challenges are described in terms of impairment (disability, special needs), words that encompass their entire beings. But \"rebel\" makes it clear it\u0027s just a part of them that\u0027s acting up. It doesn\u0027t let their challenges define who they are.Comments (42)Kathleen Miles, 2013.30.04Liat Kornowski, 2013.29.04Hamna Zubair, 2013.29.04Perry N.
