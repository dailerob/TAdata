{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Chief financial writer, The Huffington PostThe job market is still not the greatest, but we just got one hopeful sign that it might be improving a bit. The economy added 209,000 jobs in July, and the unemployment rate ticked up to 6.2 percent from 6.1 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday. Believe it or not, both of those numbers are encouraging. The reason the first number is encouraging is because, duh, jobs. The encouraging part of the second number, the unemployment rate, is less obvious. Normally, higher unemployment is bad news, and people seeing HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT on the evening news tonight will naturally assume the worst. But this time, unemployment actually rose for a good reason.With the exception of a few courageous journalists, the American view of Gaza -- the posture of looking away with pity and calling it \"heartbreaking\" as if the wild disparity of deaths did not exist -- has been an abortion of moral responsibility. It testifies to a poverty of leadership almost as desperate as that of the Israelis and the Palestinians half a world away.Professor of Literature, Yale UniversityCould you be cousins with Barack Obama? What about Gwyneth Paltrow or Albert Einstein? It\u0027s entirely possible. Find out why we\u0027re all more connected than you might think.\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"It\u0027s time for our institutions to scrap their crisis communication plans when it comes to violence against women, and replace them with real plans to protect victims and hold perpetrators accountable.President and CEO, National Network to End Domestic ViolenceThis past week the Arab American Institute (AAI) released its third biannual poll of American attitudes toward Arabs and Muslims. Conducted by Zogby Analytics, 1100 likely voters were surveyed nationwide. The results were deeply troubling.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027The two guys at the top of national security (the Director of National Intelligence and the direct of the CIA) have both been caught lying to the American people and to the US Senate -- they have no right to lie.Host, Fox News\u0027 \u0027On the Record With Greta Van Susteren\u0027I was raised to be against any act of violence, and the consequent suffering of humanity for it, regardless of religions, ethnicities and borders.Academy Award-winning actorWhen I lost all of my hair, it was difficult to adjust to being bald, but what proved to threaten my confidence even more was the loss of my eyebrows and eyelashes. These features add contrast to our faces, and without them, I suddenly looked drastically different.Happy wife and mother hoping to inspire others by writing about health challenges, the struggles of being bald, and the joys of family life.While I\u0027ve been a true believer and I\u0027ve perpetuated the belief in hard work as the great poverty buster, now when I talk to some of them I feel that I\u0027ve perpetuated a great fraud upon them.Veteran high school teacher and basketball coach, author of Students First and Other LiesI don\u0027t need to call myself derogatory names to get my ass on the road. I just go do it. It is a matter of believing in yourself because you can, not because you can in spite of how much you weigh.Runner, Daughter, Sister, Honorary Auntie, Volunteer, Occassional Blogger and All-around Cool ChickThis is one of those things that non-teachers don\u0027t entirely get. If you work in an office, time is pretty flexy. If a meeting can benefit by running an extra 10 or 15 minutes, you just do it. But in most schools, when the bell rings, you\u0027re done. There is no little extra bit of time you can just throw into the work.Teacher, writer, blogger at curmudgucationThe world has become accustomed to fighting between Israel and the Palestinians, and there has been a cumulative desensitization to the human suffering caused by the current conflict.Professor of Sociology, University of California at BerkeleySimply open your mouth on Israel-Palestine, and you\u0027ll be labeled either a heartless Zionist or a Hamas terrorist. Both extreme labels are equally fruitless. If we cannot find a middle ground in dialogue, how can we expect Israel and Palestine to find a middle ground during war?Lawyer, Speaker, Best-Selling Author of \"EXTREMIST\"The consistently, if ploddingly, improving job market appears to be arresting the worrisome decline in the labor force rate. If so, this will be an unequivocal plus for the recovery.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorIt\u0027s not really the number or rate of executive orders, however, that Obama has issued that has raised the hackles of the GOP. It\u0027s the executive orders that he has issued that have given the GOP ammunition to attempt to intimidate and politically bash Obama.Author and political analystMy other concern about the working women discourse is the notion of having it all. All what exactly? The discussion in this space often seems to limit, rather than expand, the definition of success. And with a narrow definition of success, we inadvertently limit women\u0027s choices.Executive Vice President, Office of the CEO; Founding Advocate, Widen the CircleThe first step when it comes to identity theft is admitting you have a problem. Knowing your ID IQ is a good place to start.Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911The difficulty won\u0027t disappear. We can\u0027t have it both ways: There seems to be no way to reconcile earnest opposition to the Israeli government\u0027s oppression of Palestinians and the assault on Gaza with support for the protection of Tel Aviv from Hamas rockets.Writer, translator, and educator, at work on her book about Israel, Hear Me Ask.I believe that the economic and social progress made in Brazil is the joint achievement of our young democracy and the members of the Brazilian society. But thank you, Dilma, because a recent statement of yours allowed me to recreate a wonderful experience over the skies of Brazil.Brasil Post Editor-in-ChiefWhile there\u0027s hardly anything to report directly from Apple in terms of the iPhone 6, the rumors that have been flying around are giving consumers plenty to consider. Will consumers adapt to a smartphone that allows them to view videos more easily?Founder and CEO, AudienceBloomDon\u0027t linger. Just like a hotel has to turn over and clean the room for the next guests, most likely so do your hosts. Agree well in advance when you\u0027re coming and when you\u0027re leaving and stick to plan. Know when to say, \"adios, amigos!\"CEO, The Creative Class Group \u0026 Author, UpgradeWhile it is good that 700,000 jobs were not destroyed last night, America needs to be investing to create millions of jobs, not just to prevent the worst.Co-Director, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureYou have to be a little crazy to change the world, and you can\u0027t really fake it. Without this commitment to innovative thinking, true breakthroughs can\u0027t happen.Chairman/CEO, XPRIZEOne day the gardener said to the children, \"You know, I\u0027m always telling you what we are going to grow. This time, what would you like to grow?\" To her surprise, the children had a unanimous answer: \"Kiwis!\"President, Children\u0027s Defense FundGiven the choice between immigrants entering the U.S. with a path to citizenship or Hannity and Perry with their smirky, middle-aged white itchy trigger fingers, faux badassery and gun fetishes, I\u0027ll take the immigrants in a heartbeat. So should we all.Managing Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowMuch more needs to be done to achieve a TB-free world -- one in which children will have to turn to the history books to learn such a disease ever existed.Public Health Editor, The Huffington Post; Former U.S. Assistant Surgeon GeneralWe know in our hearts that these largely ineffectual weapons do not justify bombing and shelling cafes, beaches, mosques, schools, shelters and homes containing large families, knowing that thousands of innocent civilians will be killed and wounded.Civil Rights Lawyer and Political and Public Policy JunkieSexual violence should not occur in any space, yet its appearance in correctional facilities is especially troubling -- prisons and jails are, in theory, controlled environments.Media intern, Drug Policy AllianceA sauce has the power to transform the simplest grilled seafood or chicken into an event.Grilling Authority, www.barbecuebible.comIf a man in her same position wouldn\u0027t have been embarrassed by it, why should Dorfman? If we\u0027re going to argue that Dorfman has the right to sleep with whomever she wants without shame, we can\u0027t react as if Viall was wrong to call her out on it.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarFor the fact that no matter what job she had in life, you were the most difficult, and still the most important.Writer, Marketing Co-op, and College Student.Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"GOP W.H.
