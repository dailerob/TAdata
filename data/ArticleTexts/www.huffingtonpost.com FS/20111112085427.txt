{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Associate Professor of American History, California State University, SacramentoGoing back to antiquity the only time rational human progress was made was when the oligarchs and monarchs, large landowners, and the Church were brushed aside for a moment in time. In 1776, had the American revolutionaries tried the Barack Obama approach of \"reaching out\" in a spirit of \"cooperation\" with the Tories and the British Crown there never would have been a United States of America in the first place. It\u0027s the same with the Progressive Era, the New Deal, and the Great Society -- none of these periods of reform would have been possible through \"bipartisanship.\" The Occupy Wall Street movement understands this. But it\u0027s just the beginning of the beginning.Read Post | Comments (226)Valerie Jarrett, 11/11/11Senior Advisor and Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Affairs and Public EngagementContinuing our journey toward a more perfect union won\u0027t be easy. It never is.

After all, college athletics doesn\u0027t generate a profit. The problem with this approach is that decision-makers in college sports don\u0027t have much of an incentive to generate profits.Read Post | Comments (18)Jimmy Demers, 11/11/11SingerIn honor of all our veterans, here is my version of \"America the Beautiful,\" which I recorded recently in a good friend\u0027s living room.

And to propose cuts to Medicare and Medicaid simply to preserve low tax rates for the wealthy is nothing less than a moral obscenity.Read Post | Comments (36)Aloysius Boyle, 11/11/11Captain, USMCThese economic times are tenuous. The challenge of unemployment plagues our nation with a consistent 9 percent rate.

The truth is what we all want and they should all spend the rest of their lives working on behalf of the victims and their recovery.Read Post | Comments (576)Conrad Black, 11/11/11Historian; Publisher; AuthorThe effort by junior administration officials to prevent the addition of any references to God from the speeches recorded on plaques at the Franklin D.

Kirsten Gillibrand, 11/11/11U.S. Senator from New YorkThose who serve in the National Guard and Reserves fight shoulder to shoulder with our active duty troops in battle, yet upon their return home, do not have the same access to benefits and protections. This is wrong.Read Post | Comments (23)Brandt Goldstein, 11/11/11Author and Visiting Professor at New York Law SchoolOn November 9, celebrity chef Mario Batali made the mistake of comparing Wall Street bankers to Hitler.

It kills more children under 5 years old every year than AIDS, malaria, and measles combined. Yes, read that last line again.Read Post | CommentsJimmy Soni and Jacob Wood, 11/11/11Mass-mail care packages frequently include items that are worthless in a war zone or already in abundance.
