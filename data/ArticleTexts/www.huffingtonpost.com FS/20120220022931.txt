{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, as Linsanity continued to grip the NBA, the old fashioned kind of madness dominated the political debate as the GOP continued to press its self-destructive battle over birth control. Who could have predicted that Republicans would want to make the 2012 election about uteruses instead of the economy? So we got the spectacle of a GOP-led House hearing on contraception that didn\u0027t have any women on the panel, and were treated to Santorum supporter Foster Friess\u0027 nostalgic longing for the days when \"gals\" used to put Bayer aspirin between their knees for contraception. In 2008, Obama and McCain basically split the male vote. But Obama got 56 percent of the women\u0027s vote, and 70 percent of unmarried women. Now maybe the GOP knows something the rest of us don\u0027t, but I\u0027m guessing that a war against women\u0027s sexual and reproductive freedom is not a winning 2012 strategy. Could President Obama -- still presiding over high unemployment and millions of foreclosures -- be the luckiest man on earth?Read Post | Comments (110)Bill Moyers, 2/16/12Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyHere we are once again, arguing over how to honor religious liberty without it becoming the liberty to impose on others moral beliefs they don\u0027t share. Our practical solution is the one Barack Obama embraced the other day.Read Post | Comments (1,755)Marlo Thomas, 2/17/12Award-winning actress, author, and activistAs far as I\u0027m concerned, the only thing Tiger Moms and Eagle Dads will do is ensure a boon for psychiatrists 20 years from now, as they try to help a whole generation of young adults reconcile childhoods in which they were pushed too hard and too far.Read Post | Comments (471)Gov. Chris Gregoire, 2/14/12Governor of WashingtonIn my seven-year tenure as governor of the great state of Washington, yesterday was one of the best. That\u0027s when I signed the bill providing marriage equality for all Washingtonians, and it is the day when our state said, quite simply, that love is love.Read Post | Comments (311)Arianna Huffington, 2/13/12The new supposed \"culture war\" may have captured the fevered imagination of the press corps, but not the electorate -- 71 percent of which still says the economy is the most important problem facing America.Read Post | Comments (855)Chris Kelly, 2/18/12Writer, \u0027Real Time with Bill Maher\u0027Maybe you\u0027re haunted by your brushes with birth control, maybe you\u0027re not. But we must have done something wrong -- as people, as a generation, as a nation -- to have to go through this hell again. Endlessly.Read Post | Comments (121)Bernard-Henri Lévy, 2/13/12French philosopher and writerIn an affair like this one, which is political as much as economic, and where the highly inflammable matter being toyed with is a people, their pride, their memory, their revolt, their survival, one would like to have seen things handled more deftly.Read Post | Comments (454)Eve Ensler, 2/14/12Tony award winning playwright, performer and activistToday 1 out of 3 women in the world, more than 1 billion women, will be raped or beaten. As economies collapse, we become targets.

This is a stampede of unreason, contradicted by the facts.Read Post | Comments (749)Rhea Perlman, 2/15/12Actress and advocate for childrenThe most important element of the foster care system is getting kids out of foster care and into a permanent placement so they don\u0027t have to spend their entire childhoods in courtrooms, wondering if they will ever have a place to call home.Read Post | Comments (103)Conrad Black, 2/15/12Historian, publisher, and authorIn coverage of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara taking on Wall Street firms, Time remains a staple for the smug, clichéd, only-in- America, lumpen bourgeoisie: the Mencken-roasted masses always ready to believe that if it\u0027s American it must be the best, and if it\u0027s happening in America, it must be good.Read Post | Comments (64)Daria Morgendorffer, 2/14/12Philosopher and former TV starI always assumed that when The Huffington Post finally begged me to write for them, I\u0027d take a cue from my fellow celebrities and blog about a humanitarian issue dear to my heart. Yet here I am being asked to write about Valentine\u0027s Day, I suppose because they thought my somewhat low tolerance for sentimentality would make it amusing.Read Post | Comments (97)Evan Shapiro, 2/15/12President, IFCCBS has done something truly remarkable. By introducing Unresolved Sexual Tension into the traditional Holmes-Watson Bromance -- while still managing to still keep it all safely platonic -- they have breathed new life into the staid Procedural Crime Drama Format.Read Post | Comments (116)Margaret Cho, 2/14/12Comedian, actor, and recording artistWhen you don\u0027t have friends and you have to give your not-friends cards that denote love and write their names on a paper that you would rather curse than bless, it causes problems later in life, in particular, with love.Read Post | Comments (83)Ari Berman, 2/16/12Author, \u0027Herding Donkeys\u0027If you want to know how the moneyed class, who prospered during the Bush and Clinton years, found a way to kill or water down nearly everything it objected to in the Obama years, look no further than the grip of the 1% of the 1% on our political system.Read Post | Comments (213)Cat Cora, 2/17/12ChefEvery year, more than 2.5 million children globally die due to hunger and malnutrition.
