{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AP/Michael SohnAP/Khalid MohammedAll this week, we\u0027re going to be featuring some of our favorite blog posts from the past year. Today, it\u0027s the best of May 2005, the month we were born. Enjoy this blast from the HuffPost past -- and be sure to check out The Blog for the latest current takes from our bloggers including Richard Lewis\u0027 Good News and Bad News, Deepak Chopra\u0027s The Lesson of Syriana, Katrina vanden Heuvel\u0027s The I-Word Is Gaining Ground, Joseph Nye\u0027s Balancing Liberty and Security, Bryan Gordon\u0027s One Last Holiday Request, and Meg Wolitzer\u0027s letter to Lynne Cheney.READ POST | comments05.31.2005 Nora EphronFor many years, I have lived with the secret of Deep Throat’s identity. It has been hell, and I have dealt with the situation by telling pretty much anyone who asked me, including total strangers, who Deep Throat was. Not for nothing is indiscretion my middle name.READ POST05.13.2005 Larry DavidI know this may not sound politically correct, but as someone who has abused and tormented employees and underlings for years, I am dismayed by all of this yammering directed at John Bolton.READ POST05.13.2005 John CusackWent to Hunter S. Thompson’s memorial service in Aspen. The next day, we went to Owl Farm -- which remained untouched since Hunter’s death two weeks before. The sun was shining and gunfire echoed as friends and family gathered and shot targets on the lawn.READ POST05.17.2005 Norman MailerI\u0027m beginning to see why one would want to write a blog. At present, I have a few thoughts I can certainly not prove, but the gaffe over the Michael Isikoff story in Newsweek concerning the Koran and the toilet is redolent with bad odor.READ POST05.09.2005 Mike NicholsI think that metaphor is in trouble. To take the bible literally, as fundamentalists do, is an attack on the greatest collection of metaphors we have. We need metaphor as we need stories. We need stories that mean more than just the events that transpire in them.READ POST05.27.2005 Adam McKayI believe in a strong military. I supported the incursion into Serbia. I support what we did in WW II and I support what we did in Afghanistan shortly after 9/11. But for the life of me I don\u0027t get the whole Iraq thing and how we\u0027ve all forgiven the mistakes made by our leaders that led to 100,000 Iraqi deaths and thirty thousand U.S. casualties.READ POST05.12.2005 Christopher GuestREAD POST05.25.2005 Bill MaherI can see why administration supporters would want to deflect attention away from the gist of what I was saying, which was this: now that we can\u0027t meet our recruiting goals, maybe it\u0027s the people who were so gung ho for this war to begin with who should step up and go fight it. But of course it\u0027s always easier to distract people.READ POST05.13.2005 Quincy JonesThat new Elvis movie got me to thinking about fame and massive success and about how some people can handle it -- and how for others it can be the most destructive thing in the world.READ POST05.09.2005 Sen. Jon CorzineI just saw first-hand how terrorists are made. Mix together a genocide, a civil war, oil, a failed state, and non-intervention by the global community until it is too late. And voila.READ POST05.18.2005 Al FrankenThe Coalition Provisional Authority, which we ran, has lost 8.8 billion dollars. By lost, I mean it’s totally unaccounted for. Not only has Congress not \"looked into\" this $8.8 billion and who might have it now, but it seems that some members are completely unaware that this staggering sum, which was supposed to go toward rebuilding Iraq, is missing.READ POST05.09.2005 Arianna HuffingtonRemember when patriotism was the last refuge of a scoundrel? Now it\u0027s religion. Or, I should say, the cynical and hollow use of it for the sake of political expediency.READ POST05.09.2005 David MametI understand that computers, which I once believed to be but a hermaphrodite typewriter-cum-filing cabinet, offer the cyber literate increased ability to communicate. I do not think this is altogether a bad thing, however it may appear on the surface...READ POST05.10.2005 Danielle CrittendenMaybe it is futile to hope that we can ever bridge the gap between Powertown and Tinseltown so long as the Republicans are in power. But if that day ever comes, perhaps it will go -- or should go something like this...READ POST05.23.2005 Jim LampleyThe only saving grace in the Pat Tillman scandal is that he was fighting terrorists in Afghanistan instead of manufacturing them in Iraq. Tillman\u0027s parents deserve bravery citations for telling the truth about their feelings.READ POST05.26.2005 Christine LahtiWouldn’t it be great if our First Lady, on her next overseas trip to promote the rights of women, went directly to Africa? In my fantasies, I can see her handing out condoms, AIDS education pamphlets and medical supplies during her visit.READ POST05.26.2005 Brad HallIt’s always opposite day with this bunch: No Child Left Behind, \"Mission Accomplished!\", Patriot Act, Healthy Forests Initiative, honoring Tom DeLay, et al. Got to be Opposite Day, right? The problem is that they’re leaving out Opposite Day’s most basic element: the part where you shout, “It’s Opposite Day!”READ POST05.21.2005 Simon JenkinsA year ago I walked in the market square in Fallujah. I have done some crazy things in my time but I would not walk down any street in Baghdad today. Please, America, realize that in Iraq you have not created another Vietnam or Beirut or Somalia. You have created something far, far worse and getting more so.READ POST05.19.2005 Laurie DavidI immediately replaced all of our toilet paper and tissues with post-consumer recycled materials. I did this quietly and anonymously -- just as an experiment. I wanted to see who in my family would complain first.READ POST05.31.2005 Andy SternAt the 50th anniversary of the AFL-CIO the debate is in full swing. I say we need to change and build a new, growing, dynamic, modern labor movement for the 21st century. The current President, John Sweeney, says go slow -- we cannot grow until we change public policy and labor laws. Sorry, but workers can\u0027t wait that long.READ POST05.26.2005 David SirotaHey, did you know that Congress just had one of the most important votes on the Iraq War since the invasion of 2003? No, probably not, because almost no major American news outlet thought it important enough to tell you...READ POST05.11.2005 Jon Robin BaitzThe theatre is about actors taking pauses to collect themselves, and funny makeup and the sleight of hand magic of good lighting. It doesn’t take any money at all to do it. You can do it in your kitchen. So. I am thinking of Odets and the theatre, and how much I love it.READ POST05.17.2005 Greg GutfeldGERGEN MADLIB!!! Fill in the blanks with fun, crazy terms! David Gergen is a frequent _________around the world, and contributes__________ regularly to US News and World Report...READ POST05.10.2005 Gary HartAre we, or are we not, building permanent military bases in Iraq? Yes or no?READ POST05.26.2005 Lizz WinsteadThe only science that may work to prevent kids from having sex may be reverse psychology. Maybe if you sit your kids down and say, “When I grab your mothers’ firm buttocks and mount her like a stallion, she screams for the whip and God do I make her beg for it!” After they’ve stopped throwing up, maybe they’ll vow never to have sex.READ POST05.19.2005 Jerry and Joe LongSatellite photos indicate North Korea may be preparing to detonate a nuclear bomb. Apparently they show a giant hole having been dug then refilled, and what may be some sort of reviewing stand. Here\u0027s the question...even if it\u0027s \u0027Helmet Night\u0027, why would anyone want to be in the grandstands for a nuclear test?READ POST05.17.2005 Seth GreenlandWhat we should say is \"Yes, this is an unfortunate incident. But have you godly types considered that perhaps killing people over a wet book is something of an overreaction? Just asking.”READ POSTFrom imbd.comGreenpeace/Kate Davison/ReutersFrom news.aol.com/AP/Alastair GrantAP/Wilfredo LeeFrom news.yahoo.comLogin to Huffington Post  |  Make Huff Post your Home Page  |  RSS/XML  |  Sitemap  |  Advertising  |  JobsCopyright 2005 © HuffingtonPost.com, LLC   |  User Agreement  |  Privacy  |  Comment Policy  |  Powered by MovableType","h1":"The Worst Year Of Bush\u0027s Presidency...",".title":"","h2":"The Year in HuffPo Blog PostsThe End of Political Humor as We Know ItI Have Good News and Bad NewsRevisitingThe I-Word Is Gaining GroundThe Lesson of \"Syriana\"Deep Throat and Me: Now It Can Be Told, and Not for the First Time EitherWhy I Support John BoltonGood-bye Hunter S.Intelligence 101ASo, Now, Why Have You Called Us Together?What Were We Fighting Over Again?My First Sprout of the YearFruitGod Will Walk Out of the RoomHow to Stop a GenocideWhat in God’s Name is Going On?What Would Jesus Do...
