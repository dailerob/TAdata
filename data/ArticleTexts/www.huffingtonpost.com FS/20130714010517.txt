{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundWe know how to make a positive difference in the lives of so many poor Black males. But we have to close the gap between what we know and what we do. We don’t have to keep doing the things we’re getting wrong. We can learn from what’s working. As Michael says, one starting point is to change everyone’s expectations about what young Black boys can become: “We have to change the whole narrative ... We have people in these schools teaching these children who have no understanding about what these children can be because they haven\u0027t been exposed to what the children can be, just like the children haven\u0027t been exposed oftentimes to what they can be ... Dream big.” Raising expectations combined with raising resources to get children what they need is a powerful recipe for Black boys’ success.Comments (233)BLACKYo-yo performance artistI had reached the highest title in the yo-yo world -- but yo-yo is not in the Olympics, and it is not a major sport. Even the title of world champion had no value in society. I was crushed.

Would you call this treason? If not, what would you call it? And what would you do about it?Comments (2,507)Patricia SundFlight attendant and freelance writerThere\u0027s a lot more to being a flight attendant than slinging orange juice. You just don\u0027t see it. If you saw what was covered in my manual, you\u0027d freak.

Mayor Vincent Gray five questions to consider in deciding whether he would support or veto the living wage bill passed by the city council.

What we cannot accept, nor allow, is for our own leaders to willfully exacerbate our problems and directly harm people who are already suffering -- to sacrifice the common good to their own ideological agendas.Comments (194)Larry StraussVeteran high school teacher and coach, writerWhatever the verdict and however any of us feel about it, this incident is a symptom of a sickness of which we are all a part.Comments (1,140)Suzanne LeighHealth Reporter, Essayist, BloggerAt a retreat for parents of children with brain tumor and neuroblastoma, a group of us discuss alternative treatments.

We certainly don\u0027t like all of his movies -- especially his recent ones -- but he seems like a nice enough guy. He\u0027s pleasant company on the talk show circuit and, by all accounts, is a good husband and father. Yet a lot of people will express honest-to-goodness vitriol toward Adam Sandler.Comments (235)Amy FloryWriterI used to do things. Now I do other things.

Do you think you know more than everybody? Is it always somebody\u0027s else\u0027s fault? Do you interrupt others?

I was working. I was also playing. I was working in the sense that I was becoming more familiar with how Koreans practice Buddhism.CommentsMike LuxCo-Founder, Democracy PartnersThe House Republicans aren\u0027t just betraying their alleged savior by making people go hungry. They are betraying the values this country has lived by for a very long time.Comments (66)Sanjay SanghoeeBanker, political and business commentator; author of \u0027Killing Wall Street\u0027 (www.killingwallstreet.com)How on earth do you stand up for agriculture while simultaneously denying the neediest people the means to obtain the fruits of that agriculture?Comments (296)Robert BrusteinPlaywright, director, actor, educator, theater founderThe chaos we are witnessing these days in the Middle East reflects not only a failure of American policy but also a pitiful lack of American self-knowledge.Comments (28)Dr. Gail GrossFamily \u0026 Child Expert, Educator, Author. Ph.D. Ed.D.Fear of failure or already low self-esteem may further work to push those passions down to a forgotten place, where we try to tell ourselves they belong.

We were mindful of the gravity of the experience and knew that it would be a watershed moment in our daughter\u0027s life. In the end, we thought she was ready.Comments (19)Tamsin SmithPresident, SlipStreamStrategyIt\u0027s one thing to master oneself by overcoming fear, doubt, and insecurity.
