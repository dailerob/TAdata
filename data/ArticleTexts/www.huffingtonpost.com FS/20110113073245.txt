{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Political Reporter, The Huffington PostIt is when there is a human element to his presidency that Barack Obama tends to stand the tallest. And on Wednesday evening, as he spoke to 20,000-plus at a memorial service at the University of Arizona, there was, if nothing else, an emotional honesty to what he had to say. To a nation looking for clarity, Obama didn\u0027t pretend to have all the answers. There is, he noted, a tendency to demand \"order\" from \"chaos,\" to try and \"make sense out of that which seems senseless.\" Life doesn\u0027t always comply.Read Post | CommentsBob Cesca, 01.12.2011Host of the Bob and Elvis ShowI actually agree with the Sarah Palin who said that words aren\u0027t solely responsible for acts of violence. But when she so often contradicts herself, it\u0027s difficult to tell whether Sarah Palin agrees with Sarah Palin.Read Post | CommentsJacob Heilbrunn, 01.12.2011Author, \"They Knew They Were Right: the Rise of the Neocons\"It would be hard to think of a more moving and dignified speech, particularly when set against the foil of Sarah Palin\u0027s self-absorbed effusions.Read Post | CommentsPaul Brandeis Raushenbush, 01.12.2011Religion Editor, Huffington PostThe grieving community that the president addressed stretched out to an entire nation.

With the threat still distant, patience is a virtue. The U.S. should assemble a diplomatic coalition to constrain any nuclear ambitions in Caracas.Read Post | CommentsRobert F. Kennedy Jr., 01.11.2011President, Waterkeeper Alliance; Professor, Pace UniversityOn November 22, 1963, Mummy told us that a bad man had shot Uncle Jack.
