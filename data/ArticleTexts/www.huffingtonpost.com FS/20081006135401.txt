{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOAt this point I really wonder: what\u0027s in it for McCain? Why does he want to be president? Those who have followed him for years don\u0027t recognize his agenda, his tactics, his positions (e.g., the great populist regulator!). How could a man of seemingly deep conviction morph into this caricature? His campaign is empty, with no spiritual or intellectual core; its tactics have devolved into a series of crass surprises and Hail Mary passes.Read Post | CommentsBIOJames Warren, 10.05.2008Don\u0027t assume The Economist will endorse McCain, Lauren Collins crafts an opus on Arianna, and Domino takes an absolutely gratuitous shot at all of us.Read Post | CommentsBIOAlec Baldwin, 10.05.2008This bailout is as if someone blew up a meth lab and insisted he collect on his homeowners policy.Read Post | Comments (35)BIOKen Burns, 10.05.2008Surrounded and programmed by the lobbyists he once despised, the man who once effortlessly straddled the aisle and spoke from the heart now carefully hews to a prompter-read, soulless far-right agenda.Read Post | Comments (75)BIOJane Hamsher, 10.05.2008I\u0027ll put on my Hollywood hat just for a moment so I can lead a chorus of righteous laughter at the colossal failure of the persecuted Hollywood conservatives behind An American Carol.Read Post | Comments (67)BIORahm Emanuel, 10.05.2008Praising the president for merely attempting to clean up the mess he helped make is one thing, but comparing him to Roosevelt is quite another.Read Post | Comments (14)BIOMarc Cooper, 10.05.2008McCain openly boasted about his deep collaboration with one of the most prominent of Vietnam-era student radicals, David Ifshin, who denounced America on Radio Hanoi as McCain sat locked up as a POW.Read Post | Comments (31)BIORobert Mackey, 10.05.2008Governor, you have a \"close association\" with a known former member of a radical, right-wing, well-armed and well-funded political party whose founder damned the United States as virulently as Reverend Wright did.Read Post | Comments (83)BIOPaul Jenkins, 10.05.2008The raw anger displayed by McCain is so over the top that he cannot seriously be targeting it at anyone but himself, and perhaps the Republican Party he has grown to hate.Read Post | CommentsBIOMenachem Rosensaft, 10.05.2008The GOP\u0027s unprincipled electioneering is likely to become especially ugly in the Jewish community. We are certain to hear Joe Lieberman shamelessly trying to scare elderly Jewish retirees to vote Republican.Read Post | Comments (14)BIOAKMuckraker, 10.05.2008I actually felt sorry for the organizers for a minute, before I snapped myself out of it. A head count yielded about 250-300 people. Clearly they had been hoping for more.Read Post | Comments (50)BIOBeth Broderick, 10.05.2008Sarah Palin may have given a momentary boost to her ticket, but she threatens to be a drag on her party\u0027s future.Read Post | Comments (24)BIOJohann Hari, 10.05.2008McCain wants us to talk solely about whether the surge of US troops last year has been successful. But a hole was just blown in that argument -- and blood is rushing through.Read Post | CommentsBruce Springsteen, 10.05.2008Andy Borowitz, 10.04.2008Trey Ellis, 10.04.2008Rep.
