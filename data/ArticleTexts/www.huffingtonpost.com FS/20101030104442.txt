What explains this divergence?Read Post | CommentsMike Lux, 10.29.2010Author, The Progressive Revolution: How the Best in America Came to BeThe traditional media loves to create sweeping narratives about elections. But little things like who actually controls Congress are decided by narrower margins than the sweeping-narrative writers like to admit.Read Post | CommentsMichael Shaw, 10.29.2010Publisher of the visual politics and photojournalism site, BagNewsNotesWith covers, it\u0027s all about timing, baby.Read Post | CommentsRobert Creamer, 10.28.2010Political organizer, strategist and authorMost of the punditry continues to assume that the die is cast -- that Republicans will win control of the House this fall. Certainly that outcome is entirely possible. But there is a Democratic path to victory next Tuesday.Read Post | CommentsLes Leopold, 10.29.2010Author, \"The Looting of America\"Why is the Democratic Party losing support from the people who are usually its most ardent supporters -- everyday working people?

Well, he\u0027s back -- or more accurately, he never really left. You just didn\u0027t know it.Read Post | CommentsMitchell Bard, 10.29.2010Writer and FilmmakerWhen you pull a lever on Tuesday, you may think you are voting for one candidate or another, but, in the big picture, the vote won\u0027t be for a person. Instead, you will be voting based on these opposing principles.Read Post | CommentsBarry Scheck, 10.29.2010Co-Founder and Co-Director, The Innocence ProjectConviction tells a story about just one family\u0027s fight against injustice, but there are many others -- every time an innocent is imprisoned a family pays a steep price.Read Post | CommentsNina Burleigh, 10.28.2010Author of Unholy Business: A True Tale of Faith, Greed and Forgery in the Holy LandHow can it be 2010, and the premier chronicler of American family dynamics in our generation producing this retro, cautionary tale about the dreadful consequences of female lust?
