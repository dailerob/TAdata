Yes, foreigners do not appreciate the exquisite delicacy of the central government\u0027s balancing act. But, still, the genie of China\u0027s economic dynamism is out of the bottle. And the PRC\u0027s upwardly ambitious middle class has achieved critical mass. The country\u0027s institutions need to evolve with the times, lest the Chinese people lose faith in a paternalistic government\u0027s ability to slowly but surely implement an economic agenda that delivers broad-based opportunity. Should that happen, Xi JinPing\u0027s Mandate of Heaven will evaporate and the world will be a much more uncertain place.TEL AVIV -- The Islamic State is here to stay for the long-term, if not indefinitely, and the coalition should accordingly give up on pretensions to \"degrade and destroy\" ISIS.

They are passionate, and they can and will bring change in a world that, we can only hope, they may understand even better than we do.Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationThe Watts Riots took place fifty years ago, but I remember them vividly. I was thirteen years old, and on the morning of August 12, 1968, I woke up at Pepperdine University where I stayed the night for church camp.Congresswoman representing California\u0027s 44th districtWhy Sanders? Why not a more obvious target, like Martin O\u0027Malley? I\u0027m not in the business of telling people to ask, \"Stop killing us,\" in a more friendly tone, but I do feel comfortable observing that calling out Bernie Sanders, of all people, on the issue of white supremacy feels a bit bizarre.Founder, Grub Street; former Associate News Editor, The Huffington PostIf international relations obeyed the rules of logic, the United States and North Korea would be sitting down right now to work out their differences.Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogSo you gulped down your beer a little too fast.
