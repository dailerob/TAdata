{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Today, we live in a world where networked-based technologies transform the way we live, work and play. I have had the opportunity to witness firsthand how these same technologies are also transforming the way we learn.Cristina McGlewSenior Manager, Corporate Affairs, Latin America and the CaribbeanKathleen ReardonProfessor, USC Marshall School; Author, \u0027The Secret Handshake\u0027 and \u0027Shadow Campus\u0027Before women candidates can even begin to make their arguments and present their platforms, they must face frequent verbal attacks intended to take them down a peg or more -- merely for being women. Is it too much to hope that more people grow aware of just how female candidates\u0027 behaviors are marked? Are political observers and journalists at last advanced enough to recognize when certain actions are being disparaged simply because a woman is taking them? Or do we remain suckers in a land of sophists, buying into innuendo, believing whatever\u0027s implied -- even if it has nothing whatsoever to do with the truth?Arthur Gelb was a master builder, the Robert Moses of newspapering. His eyes danced when he told stories about dreaming up the multi-sectioned New York Times.Jill AbramsonExecutive Editor of the New York Times from 2011-2014What happened at the Phoenix VA is a real tragedy, and it deserves an investigation and a response. Without polling, I can tell you pretty much all of America\u0027s veterans believe that. But, what veterans don\u0027t seem to be saying yet, at least in the survey of our supporters, is that Eric Shinseki should resign.Jon SoltzCo-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranOur need to redefine success is as urgent on the collective level as it is in our personal lives. Limiting our metrics of success to money and power and completely defining ourselves by our jobs creates a political class obsessed with short-term gain -- one that\u0027s not up to the types of long-term challenges we\u0027re now facing.Arianna HuffingtonThis is crazy stuff, and it makes it difficult if not impossible to have a reasonable discussion about the pros and cons of the Common Core.Diane RavitchResearch Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027Among the hundreds of thousands of twenty-somethings graduating from American colleges this month, an increasing number may consider forgoing the traditional first job search and opting instead for what has become something of the new American dream: Being your own boss.Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarI am no fan of the TFA program. I do not believe that five or six weeks of training -- in a controlled environment, to boot -- is in any way sufficient to prepare you for the classroom.Mercedes SchneiderPublic school teacher, education activist, PhDI was diagnosed with ALS in February 2013. A year later the shock from being told weakness in my hand was the first step of a uniformly fatal disease has worn off, but all of my fears are the same.Stephen FingerHusband, father, brother, son, living with ALSThe military hammer the US government has been using against terrorist suspects for over 12 years has not succeeded in eliminating al-Qaeda; it has helped spawn a resurgence of terrorist groups across war-torn Middle East and now into Africa.Medea BenjaminCo-founder, CODEPINK: Women for PeaceFor years now the corporate Internet Service Providers have been pushing for a tiered system of Internet delivery. They want the FCC to allow them to construct \"fast lanes\" and \"slow lanes\" on the Internet.Joseph A. PalermoProfessor, historian, authorYesterday, Republican Speaker John Boehner admitted that \"there\u0027s not that big a difference\" between the Tea Party and the GOP. The results of last night\u0027s primaries are just the latest confirmation that this is true. The civil war in the Republican Party is over and the Tea Party has won.Rep.

But how much compromise will depend on how much sway spoilers in both countries have.John TirmanExecutive Director, MIT Center for International StudiesIf the Secretary of Veterans Affairs is so passionate, why does he use life-sucking bureaucratic doublespeak, referring to \"adverse events,\" rather than speaking plainly? Tell it like it is.Joseph BobrowFounder and president, Coming Home ProjectMy wish is that by supporting the Museum I\u0027m doing what little I can to preserve the memory of Deputy Chief Jimmy Riches\u0027 son and the nearly 3,000 other victims of the attacks.Allison GilbertDespite the clear efforts to address an epidemic, A.J. Delgado is just the latest in a line of conservative writers arguing there isn\u0027t a campus rape problem.Unfortunately, they\u0027re wrong.Tyler KingkadeAssociate Editor, The Huffington PostI\u0027m joined tonight on PBS by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.). Paul discusses his filibuster earlier today on the Senate floor outlining his opposition to the president\u0027s nomination of David Barron to the First U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.Tavis SmileyPBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorFor decades, Congress has implemented policies that distort America\u0027s criminal justice system and tip the scales of justice in favor of punishment over rehabilitation. As a matter of civil rights and basic justice, our criminal justice system must change.Rep. John ConyersDean, Congressional Black Caucus\"I don\u0027t want that to happen to me,\" my 9-year-old son whimpered with tears streaming down his face. We\u0027d just finished watching the documentary, Fed Up - which targets the childhood obesity epidemic and the role the food industry plays in marketing unhealthy foods to children.Kimberly CooperWriter, Development Consultant, Public Health AdvocateThe health of all bees is of paramount importance for our survival on Earth. Frighteningly, bees worldwide are terribly ill.Dr. Reese HalterBroadcaster, Conservation Biologist, EducatorBefore the current Stanley Cup playoffs started, I predicted that Rule 69 (Goaltender Interference) was going to be a trouble spot in the postseason. It didn\u0027t take a psychic to successfully make that prediction.Paul StewartRetired NHL Player and NHL Referee, ECAC Director of Hockey Officiating, Chairman KHL Officiating Evaluation and Discipline CommitteesHow many times had I been sitting at the bar not realizing the guy next to me was fighting his own battle? Or how about across the bar? Or the bartender? Or the guy making my pizza?Adam GriffinFounder and CEO of BodeefitMany of society\u0027s favorite psychoactive compounds, both legal and illegal, work by hijacking our own neurotransmitters and brain receptor sites. In other words, they aren\u0027t creating something out of nothing -- they only work because our brains are set up to get high and feel pleasure.Mark SissonFormer elite marathoner and triathlete; Author, \u0027The Primal Blueprint\u0027Students have routinely been cast as spoiled and narrow-minded, their protests construed as signs of a newly ascendant liberal intolerance. Most disconcerting, student dissent and resistance have been wrongly equated with bigotry and censorship. This latter equation warrants extra scrutiny.Craig BorowiakPolitical scientistThe US Military has a war plan for the zombie apocalypse. Wonderful. Beautiful end of story for USSTRATCOM. Except it isn\u0027t.Michael VlahosAudaciously, we believe that every parent in America should be given the choice to opt-in for standardized testing, rather than being forced to opt-out.Chris GoeringAssociate Professor of English Education, University of Arkansas; Blogger, EduSanityThe fast-food industry must take responsibility for the risks that its unbalanced approach to human capital management have created for shareowners, workers, communities and the economy as a whole.Scott M. StringerComptroller of the City of New YorkFor years Americans have assumed that our hard-charging capitalism is better than the soft-hearted version found in Canada and Europe. American capitalism might be a bit crueler but it generates faster growth and higher living standards overall.Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Conversations about trigger warnings seem more and more like superficial proxies for ones about deeper problems on campuses regarding diversity, equity, the corporatization of education, and, the dreaded word, privilege.Soraya ChemalyFeminist, Writer, Satirist... not always in that orderIt is hard to imagine that most parents, even in conservative states, are comfortable dining next to a group of people toting large weapons. By distributing photos that show just what that looks like, Moms Demand Action has hit on an effective strategy.Ben HallmanSenior Financial Writer, The Huffington PostSo I feel like stay-at-home moms have been keeping a big secret.
