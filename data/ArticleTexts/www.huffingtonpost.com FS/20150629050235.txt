It was a week in which President Obama found the voice that so many of us hoped we discerned in 2008; a week in which two Justices of the Supreme Court resolved that the legitimacy of the institution and their own legacy as jurists was more important than the narrow partisan agenda that Justices Roberts and Kennedy have so often carried out; a week in which liberals could feel good about ourselves and the haters of the right were thrown seriously off balance. Yet this is one of those inflection points in American politics that could go either way. It could energize the forces of racial justice and racial healing. It could reconstitute the Supreme Court as a body that takes the Constitution seriously. The week’s events could shame, embarrass and divide the political right. Or the events of the week could energize the haters.I believe your generation will do a better job than mine at fixing the problem of gender inequality. So we turn to you.

Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoThe Greek government has squandered all its goodwill within half a year through a combination of arrogance, belligerence, naivety and utter incompetence.

It has achieved neither.Associate professor in the School of Public and International Affairs at the University of GeorgiaMany reformsters have one fundamental point in common: They don\u0027t really believe in democracy.

But there is a huge difference in the two rulings.E.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeTurkey is headed in a dangerous direction, toward a corrupt, authoritarian state. The country needs an Arab Spring of sorts, but within the democratic process. An electoral revolution, not a street putsch. The use of the rule of law to end an illiberal government.
