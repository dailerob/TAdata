{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Dan FroomkinExecutive Editor, FearlessMedia.orgI decided to closely examine this morning\u0027s coverage of the vote because such a blatantly absurd and cruel move struck me as a good test of whether the Washington press corps could ever bring itself to call things as they so obviously are -- or whether they would check their very good brains at the door and just write triangulating mush that leaves readers to fend for themselves. It was no contest. And as it happens, the Times editorial board actually understated things. Yesterday\u0027s vote was not only an undeniable act of heartlessness, it was also perhaps the ultimate example of how today\u0027s increasingly radical and unhinged GOP leadership picks on the poor, coddles the rich, and plays time-wasting political games instead of governing. The important thing about this vote to anyone paying any attention at all was the subtext -- what it really meant. But the coverage was stenographic and context-deficient.Comments (180)Elizabeth DrewJournalistOnly the members of the electorate can restore the institutions and procedures that make our democratic system work, starting with the next chance they get.Comments (17)Dan PallottaAuthor of \"Uncharitable\"Could it be that everything we\u0027ve been taught about charity, and about giving, and about change is backwards? Is it possible that in the name of an ethic we are actually prolonging the suffering of millions of adults and children the world over?Comments (165)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureForget the debt ceiling for a moment, if you can. Forget the GOP\u0027s attempt to shut down the government over the Affordable Care Act. Who is going to explain to the American people how profoundly misguided, and even immoral, the Republicans\u0027 entire economic agenda has become?Comments (435)Willie NelsonPresident of Farm AidToday, as the minutes tick down to another farm bill deadline, people in towns and cities everywhere are taking matters into their own hands. They\u0027re standing up with family farmers and insisting on food that is best for them and their families.Comments (271)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarExcessive violence in films and on TV has been joined by excessive sex, much of it acted out according to porn-established norms. Even if much of this is artistic commentary, without discussion, kids begin to believe this is how sex really works.Comments (22)Jason KirellCombat veteran, former reporter and bloggerI didn\u0027t risk my life in Afghanistan so I could come back and watch people go hungry in America. I certainly didn\u0027t risk it so I could come back and go hungry. Anyone who genuinely supports cutting food stamps is not an intellectual or an ideologue -- they\u0027re a bully.Comments (639)Grand CousinBand\"Camera\" is a song about the paranoia that comes with passion.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr.

We can\u0027t solve climate change overnight -- but we can get closer to a solution.Comments (279)Josh HorwitzExecutive Director, Coalition to Stop Gun ViolenceWhen individuals like Aaron Alexis are not prohibited purchasers under existing federal law, it is obvious that universal background checks alone are not enough. We need to have a national discussion about expanding the disqualifying criteria.Comments (533)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027SNAP has enjoyed bipartisan support through the years, but now Congressional Republicans are determined to cut these critical nutrition programs to America\u0027s hungry.Comments (856)Ellen SeidmanBlogger, Love That MaxConsidering parents of kids with special needs to be saints overestimates us, and underestimates our children.Comments (64)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorPresident Obama is clearly aware of the risk associated with Wall Street misbehavior, but he has failed to champion significant reforms. Here are several suggestions that the president should consider.Comments (25)Arianna HuffingtonIn this week\u0027s issue, we feature the latest in our \"Invisible Casualties\" series on suicide in the military. In this installment, David Wood tells the story of Navy Petty Officer Joshua Lipstein, an Iraq war veteran whose struggle with drugs and depression ended when he took his own life at 23.CommentsElizabeth GoreResident Entrepreneur, United Nations FoundationI was very nervous to ask our leadership and board to give up $350,000 in those bed nets to pay for the overhead and infrastructure of creating a public campaign to raise awareness on malaria preventionCommentsNoel AlumitAuthor, State Commissioner, Divinity StudentIt is a small sorority of women who can call themselves Miss America. It gets even smaller when you consider how many women of color have won. This week, the sisterhood of Asian Miss Americas has grown to two.Comments (35)David Michael McFarlaneWriter and blogger; student, Union Theological Seminary in New YorkI can say with integrity my faith is richer for my belief in evolution, not worse. So I\u0027m asking, Christians, can we quit fighting this battle? Can we reevaluate what truly deserves protest and lobbying dollars?Comments (103)Martha BurkMoney Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsHere\u0027s a challenge for each member of the U.S. House who favors fat-cat farmers and corporations over food for the poor. Instead of a huge campaign contribution, ask big ag write you a check $134. Feed yourself on that -- and only that -- for the next month.Comments (224)Frank SchaefferNew York Times best-selling authorThe pope just told the American Catholic religious right to shove off. He said that the political game they\u0027ve been playing on behalf of people like the Koch brothers and Tea Party -- in the name of morality -- threatens, the moral structure of the Church.Comments (51)Annie Lennox and Dr. Mitchell BesserWe can\u0027t rest until we stop all children from being infected with HIV and orphaned because their mothers don\u0027t get the care they need. With the clock ticking towards the end of the Millennium Development Goals, we need to raise awareness.CommentsChristopher MathiasNew York Editor, The Huffington PostThe gist of this anonymously-sourced \"journalism\" is this: that a federal judge\u0027s ruling last month -- which said that the NYPD\u0027s use of stop and frisk is unconstitutional -- might be responsible for an uptick in gun violence over the last month.Comments (23)Robert CreamerPolitical Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersThey know that once it is fully implemented, it will be impossible to take away the many benefits of ObamaCare. It is one thing to prevent something good from being passed by Congress. It\u0027s quite another to take something away from the voters.Comments (452)FoodbeastFood news, all day.Ready to have your mind blown, your childish innocence shattered, your ideas of everything right in the world torn asunder?CommentsPhil ButlerEditor in Chief, Everything PRControl has become the Catch 22 of giving.

NBC and CBS made a whopper on Monday: they wrongfully identified Rollie Chance as the killer of 12 people at the Navy Yard. It is horrible that they did that.Comments (18)Phaedra Ellis-LamkinsCEO, Green for AllShe had a cart full of groceries and she was judging our family based on the jar of pickles and food stamps.
