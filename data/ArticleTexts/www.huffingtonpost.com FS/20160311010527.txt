{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressIt\u0027s safe to say that there\u0027s not a lot of love for Trump on Capitol Hill. But what if I told you that those lawmakers can do something, right now, to give an outlet to their Trump antipathy and make the world a better place to boot? Because I can think of one thing they can do: pass a federal law protecting people from strategic lawsuits against public participation, more colloquially known as SLAPP suits. What is a SLAPP suit? Basically, it\u0027s a lawsuit designed to chill free expression, in which a deep-pocketed litigant sues their critics knowing that the mere process of having to participate in the court battle could financially exhaust the defendant. Such lawsuits favor large corporations and wealthy plaintiffs, even when their cases are entirely frivolous. And Donald Trump? He loves him some SLAPP suits.Republicans\u0027 stance on Supreme Court nominees and their response to the extremists at the top of their party\u0027s ticket are the same issue. And the solution is simple. If Republican Senators want to stand up to extremists running for president, they can start by standing up to extremists in the Senate. They can start by doing their jobs.Democratic Senator from MassachusettsToo many students don\u0027t have the resources they need. Today, we start to change that.We write to you as scholars of American history, politics, and the law. We express our dismay at the unprecedented breach of norms by the Senate majority in refusing to consider a nomination for the Supreme Court made by a president with 11 months to serve in the position.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoSimply by using the Internet, you have no choice but to share large amounts of personal information with your broadband provider. You have a right to know what information is being collected. It\u0027s your data. How it\u0027s used and shared should be your choice.Chairman, Federal Communications CommissionIn their own way, Catholics for Trump are presenting the country and the American Catholic church with the bill for a moral and intellectual bankruptcy that it will not be easy to recover from, even for one of the most important churches in modern global Catholicism.Professor of History of Christianity, University of St. ThomasAlthough his opponents seek to paint him as too far left, Bernie Sanders\u0027 views are mainstream. Hillary Clinton argued that Sanders\u0027 ideas are not realistic and too expensive. \"If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is,\" Clinton said. In fact, the ideas that Sanders has injected into the campaign are hardly radical. Sanders is in sync with the majority of Americans on most key issues.E.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeI\u0027m quite sure that it is a scientific fact that parents never feel like fully functional human beings again.Blogger, A Morning GrouchWhat makes 2017\u0027s Congressional Progressive Caucus People\u0027s Budget so strong is what it doesn\u0027t do: It does not include Social Security. Finally, a budget that follows the law!Founding Co-director, Social Security WorksThis week is the 5th anniversary of one of the worst disasters in the history of nuclear power. Unfortunately the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has not done enough to ensure that kind of an accident can\u0027t happen here.Senior Writer, Union of Concerned ScientistsFor some people, it\u0027s unimaginable that a 10-year-old girl could be so sad that she can\u0027t imagine a future. That she sees the world as a better place without herself in it. For so many Aboriginal people it\u0027s hard to imagine a harmonious world full of joy with you in it.SBS World News Political Reporter and Aboriginal woman from Gamilaroi and Gomeroi country in Northern NSWAs a Black American Muslim, I am not challenged with the belief that America is not my country and I don\u0027t belong. However, being Black in America has taught me something unique about being unapologetically Muslim.Muslim, African-American, Interfaith Presenter, Blogger, Seeker of Truth, Promoting Consciousness, Driven by Intuition, Tar Heel Born and BredSunday night, in Germany and by extension in the rest of Europe, we will face a new political scenario. Will Merkel manage to face it like a strong leader, just as she has done so far, instead of being slowly but surely destroyed by it?Editor in Chief, The Huffington Post ItalyNo matter what Erdogan\u0027s real motivation is for the unlawful order to takeover Zaman media, it is obvious that Erdogan wants to silence all critical voices. For many, it was one of the darkest days of Turkish history -- and it seems that it will not be the last one.Journalist, writer and political analystI love Louis Farrakhan, namely because of the hundreds of thousands of black lives -- including mine -- that he has saved. Now that the ADL has new leadership and the old style of management is gone, I wonder if we can begin a new chapter.Founder, GlobalGrind.comWhile Mother Nature is stealing some of the headlines from Donald Trump, the major networks are missing the real story. They blame this year\u0027s extreme weather on the \"Godzilla\" El Niño. But where is Godzilla getting its strength?Executive Director, Presidential Climate Action ProjectI vowed to use this experience to educate others about this rare, but dangerous condition. There is no predicting who will get ocular melanoma. And the symptoms are often so subtle, that patients aren\u0027t diagnosed until later stages, when their vision and their lives are threatened.Mother, Business woman, Health Advocate, Cancer FighterThe wall America needs should not be effective at keeping immigrants from entering our great nation. It needs to protect us from the vast array of hostile hackers who wish to do us harm from both within and beyond our sovereign borders.Author of Swiped. Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Co-founder of Credit.com and IDT911Behind the scenes, \"top U.S. military commanders\" have reportedly been talking up a renewed, decades-long commitment to Afghanistan and its security forces, what one general has termed a \"generational approach\" to the war there.Editor, TomDispatch.comIt is a very hard thing to do, to listen to Trump and try to parse the sense from the nonsense. But it has got to be done. If not, the only explanation for his astounding electoral success is that we are a nation of racists and morons. That\u0027s not the case.Senior Fellow, DemosPutting an end to rehashing, second-guessing, and catastrophic predictions is easier said than done. But with consistent practice, you can limit your negative thinking patterns:Psychotherapist and author of \u002713 Things Mentally Strong People Don\u0027t Do\u0027Based on recent events, it is clear that anti-environmentalists, companies that pollute the environment, and even anti-environment members of the Court, recognize that they have lost their strongest ally.Professor of Law, PaceI want to travel because I want to learn. Because I want to have fun. Because I want to make memories I\u0027ll cherish my whole lifetime.

Whatever happened to humility as a virtue for leaders?Senior Fellow, Harvard Business SchoolLast weekend hundreds of us lined up to enter the gym in central Topeka, Kansas, where my now 33-year-old daughter attended middle school. My long line of already registered voters was not nearly as long as the parallel line of young people registering to vote, and erstwhile Republicans switching to the Democratic Party to caucus for Bernie Sanders.Freelance writerI\u0027ve been reluctant to use the \"f\" word to describe Donald Trump because it\u0027s especially harsh, and it\u0027s too often used carelessly. But Donald Trump has finally reached a point where parallels between his presidential campaign and the fascists of the first half of the 20th century are too evident to overlook.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027It is difficult to watch Donald Trump\u0027s ascent in the Republican Party this election season, without drawing parallels to another uniquely American demagogue: Wisconsin senator Joseph McCarthy.Scholar-in-Residence at History and Professor of History at the University of OklahomaI feel that her example as, most importantly, a loving, strong, devoted wife and then as our country\u0027s First Lady, was and should be an inspiration to all. My husband and I will miss her, but we feel happy that she is now joined again with her soulmate and partner in life and in love.ArtistThe Brookings Institution recently issued a report showing that poor Americans die at a much earlier age than rich Americans, and that this life expectancy gap between rich and poor is growing rapidly.Writer/Editor, Bernie 2016Obama\u0027s job approval polling average is now once again \"above water\" -- defined as more people who approve of the job he\u0027s doing than disapprove.
