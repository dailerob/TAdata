No matter what happens, it\u0027s the way it is, and you have to keep going. And that is where the optimism lives. If you truly believe that you can do it no matter what, you\u0027ve got this.Wine and marketing expertI\u0027m part of the recent mass exodus of young people from the church that has evangelical leaders wondering to each other, what went wrong?
