{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"The Obamas\u0027 redecoration of the Oval Office is very cautious, neutral, inoffensive, neither one thing nor the other -- the Audacity of Taupe. But I applaud the switch from flowers to a bowl of fruit on the new coffee table. In times of great economic hardship, it makes a world of sense to be able to eat the centerpiece if necessary. However, the decision to festoon the new carpet with quotes from Lincoln, F.D.R., J.F.K., Teddy Roosevelt and Martin Luther King seems a tad Hallmark-y, and a little prepubescent -- something Sasha\u0027s fellow fourth graders might suggest (Malia\u0027s seventh-grade friends would probably find it \"lame\"). What\u0027s next, adding the doodle of a heart with \"Barack + Michelle\"?Read Post | CommentsBernard-Henri Lévy, 09.02.2010French philosopher and writerSajjad is the only one who can provide exact news of his mother. With a good deal of patience and thanks to Iranian bloggers, I managed to speak with him, and it is an extremely moving story.Read Post | CommentsSec. Hilda Solis, 09.02.2010U.S. Secretary of LaborIt\u0027s become a tradition for labor secretaries to use Labor Day to speak on the status of the American worker. Some have made remarks from podiums. Others have testified on Capitol Hill. I want to talk directly to you -- the American worker.Read Post | CommentsJacqueline Novogratz, 09.02.2010Founder and CEO of Acumen Fund, Author of The Blue SweaterI notice a little boy. His eyes are piercing, hot and angry, a tiny pipsqueak who has seen too much sadness and felt too much fear in his life. Maybe this little man is the most honest man here. His anger is raw, and he doesn\u0027t hide it.Read Post | CommentsRobert Reich, 09.02.2010Former Secretary of Labor, Professor at BerkeleyPay no attention to the stock market. The real economy is jobs and paychecks, what people buy and what they sell. And the real economy -- even viewed from a worldwide perspective -- is as precarious as ever, perhaps more so.Read Post | CommentsArne Duncan, 09.02.2010U.S. Secretary of EducationAs students head back to school, I traveled over the last two weeks on an eight-state bus tour to highlight \"Courage in the Classroom.\" The mission of the tour was simple: to honor our nation\u0027s unsung heroes -- our teachers.Read Post | CommentsSteven G. Brant, 09.03.2010Social systems scientist. Reporting real solutions to society\u0027s problems.BP is attempting to leverage its promised $20 billion Gulf Restoration Fund to get the US government to let it keep drilling in the Gulf. This $20 billion is a penalty. BP does not deserve to be compensated for paying its debt to society.Read Post | CommentsDerrick Crowe, 09.02.2010Political Director, Brave New FoundationNo matter how much the Pentagon spins their message into the mainstream media, the facts on the ground show the U.S. lacks one of counterinsurgency\u0027s own premises for success: a legitimate host nation government.Read Post | CommentsJim Wallis, 09.02.2010Christian leader for social changeBefore, I thought you were just another cable news talk show host. Now, you are using the language of a spiritual and even a religious leader. But to invoke the name of God and the vocation of a spiritual leader has consequences.Read Post | CommentsSteve Clemons, 09.01.2010Publisher of \"The Washington Note\"What Barack Obama described in the 2008 campaign is what we are seeing unfold in the country. Guns and religion -- or, in other words, fear and intolerance.Read Post | CommentsNorman Solomon, 09.01.2010Author of War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to DeathWith his commitment to war in Afghanistan, President Obama is propagating an exculpatory view of any and all U.S. war efforts -- as if the immoral can become the magnificent by virtue of patriotic alchemy.Read Post | CommentsLarry Beinhart, 09.02.2010Author, \u0027Salvation Boulevard,\" \"Wag the Dog,\" \"The Librarian.\"Economists, historians, and, as we move into the present, journalists and pundits, offer a mixed multitude of reasons for each American recession. But now that we\u0027ve had four of them (including the crash of 2,000), we can see a pattern emerging.Read Post | CommentsCraig Aaron, 09.02.2010Managing Director, Free PressYou\u0027re either for net neutrality, or you\u0027re against it. The problem with the middle ground is that it doesn\u0027t exist; the search is futile. But that doesn\u0027t mean you can\u0027t go on searching for it forever.Read Post | CommentsGeorge Mitrovich, 09.02.2010President,The City Club of San DiegoKeith Olbermann and Rachel Maddow are smart and talented performers, no less committed in their beliefs and values than Beck, but, hypothetically, their ability to attract a similar size crowd to Beck\u0027s, doubtful.Read Post | CommentsMike Elk, 09.02.2010Labor JournalistCurrently, the \"scab\" workers running the plant are unfamiliar with the system they are using.

Unity in America is not to be taken for granted. Every generation must both preserve and protect our nation\u0027s core principle.Read Post | CommentsMerton and Joan Bernstein, 09.02.2010Social Security is performing just as it was designed to: expand benefit payout when the economy weakens and building on the biblical principle of laying up reserves during years of plenty to meet needs in leaner years.Read Post | CommentsBrendan Nyhan, 09.01.2010Political scientist and media criticThe reality is that Obama\u0027s current standing -- and the rush to blame it on tactical failures -- could be predicted months ago based on structural factors. His approval ratings largely reflect a poor economy.Read Post | CommentsGeorge Lakoff, 09.02.2010Author, The Political Mind, Moral Politics, Don\u0027t Think of an Elephant!The Democrats cannot take their base for granted. Only moral leadership backed by actions and communicated effectively can excite the Obama base once more. Without that excitement, the Democrats will lose big.Read Post | CommentsBob Cesca, 09.01.2010Host of the Bob and Elvis ShowWhile everyone is focused on the crowd sizes or Glenn Beck\u0027s tall tale about holding in his bare hands George Washington\u0027s inaugural address at the National Archives, the more important questions ought to be about the money.Read Post | CommentsWill Bunch, 09.01.2010Author, \"The Backlash\"A push for job creation would bring work for many people now simmering in the toxic right-wing media bubble instead. The conditions fueling the Obama backlash may lift -- if we can somehow lift the conditions holding back America as a whole.Read Post | CommentsSteven Cohen, 09.01.2010Executive Director, The Earth Institute, Columbia UniversityThe issue of sustainability is no longer a luxury item or an add-on to those factors routinely addressed by management; it has moved to the apex of management concerns.Read Post | CommentsAmy B. Dean, 09.02.2010Co-Author, \"A New New Deal: How Regional Activism Will Reshape the American Labor Movement\"This Labor Day, I propose we think less about the material gains that working Americans have secured.
