{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOThis week\u0027s market action serves as a vivid reminder of how dependent valuations are on central bank policies. The question for markets thus boils down to whether central banks will do more; and the issues these institutions face are extremely and increasingly complex. The markets\u0027 obsession with central bank policies will not go away any time soon. Moreover, it will evolve over time to also include the question that holds the key to sustaining over time the bull market: whether central banks will be able to hand off the policy challenge -- either to a robust economy or to other institutions that have better tools yet, for a host of reasons, have preferred to remain on the sidelines until now?Read Post | Comments (11)Marlo Thomas, 04/05/12Award-winning actress, author, and activistMichael J. Fox did not permit the ravages of a disease to extinguish his spirit. Instead, he decided to fight back rather than lay back.Read Post | Comments (94)Joy Marini, MS, PA-C, 04.05.2012Director, Corporate Contributions, Johnson \u0026 JohnsonThere are moments in all of our lives that take our breath away - moments that are either so stunning or emotionally moving that time seems to stand still. But not every mother gets to have that breathtaking moment, because not every baby takes a first breath.Read Post | Comments (1)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 04/05/12Author, \u0027Our Fathers, Ourselves. Daughters, Fathers, and the Changing American Family\u0027A gay man can grin and say ironically, \"I\u0027m a really good mother,\" which may mean that he performs the daily child care in his home, but his comment does not define him as a mom. Nor is a lesbian who coaches her son\u0027s hockey team a father. Both are just doing what parents do.Read Post | CommentsArianna Huffington, 04/04/12You\u0027d think a ten-and-a-half year war would be a major issue in a presidential campaign. But our political and media establishments seem to regard being in a constant state of war as simply part of the \"new normal\".Read Post | Comments (1,719)Chris Mooney, 04/05/12Author, \u0027The Republican War on Science\u0027 and \u0027The Republican Brain\u0027Truthiness is the quality of knowing something in your gut or your heart, as opposed to in your head. Colbert didn\u0027t just diagnose a deep malady in American political discourse. He also used phrases that anticipated research results on the differences between liberals and conservatives.Read Post | Comments (245)Mike Lux, 04/05/12Partner, Democracy PartnersPresident Obama\u0027s speech this week went after the extremists who control the Republican Party hard, and he nailed it. I was glad to see him explicitly tie Ryan and Romney to their Social Darwinist ancestors.Read Post | Comments (41)Nan Aron, 04/05/12President, Alliance for JusticeIt\u0027s probably too much to ask that the Supreme Court\u0027s right wing espouse the same principles from one case to the next. But legal flip-flopping is not the biggest potential problem in the Court\u0027s consideration of the Affordable Care Act.Read Post | Comments (26)Kathleen Fordyce Rohan, 04/05/12WriterDid I do everything I could to help him? Why do I get to live, blessed so far to be disease free?

They eventually accumulate so much of the nation\u0027s total income and wealth that the middle class no longer has the purchasing power to keep the economy going full speed.Read Post | CommentsDavid Wild, 04/05/12TV Writer; Contributing Editor, Rolling Stone; Co-Author, \u0027Diary of a Player\"\u0027Eighteen years ago, I was in Paris, France with the Counting Crows in the lobby of a beautiful little hotel when we all got the ugly big news that Kurt Cobain had died.Read Post | Comments (37)Noah Michelson, 04/05/12Editor, HuffPost Gay VoicesIt really has been six months -- and an incredible six months at that. But not every reaction to Gay Voices has been positive. We\u0027ve received our fair share of disgruntled emails, Tweets, comments, and Facebook posts, and I\u0027d like to address the four topics that I\u0027ve heard about the most.Read Post | Comments (25)Bill McKibben, 04/05/12Author of a dozen books, including \u0027The End of Nature\u0027 and \u0027Deep Economy\u0027There\u0027s a problem: the very word \"subsidies\" makes American eyes glaze over. If due attention is to be paid, we have to figure out a language in which to talk about them that will make it clear just how loony our policy is.Read Post | Comments (101)Seth Shostak, 04/05/12Senior Astronomer, SETI InstituteCould there be a faster way to discover interesting galactic neighbors? Is there some scheme for detecting aliens that might work quicker than tuning in their radio transmissions or hunting down their laser pulses?Read Post | CommentsRobert Scheer, 04/05/12Editor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027The GOP has defined itself indelibly as the party of moneyed greed and unfettered imperialism. The Republicans are a sick joke, and their narrow ideological stupidity has left rational voters no choice in the coming presidential election but Barack Obama.Read Post | Comments (411)John Tirman, 04/05/12Executive Director, MIT Center for International StudiesAmericans are not much aware of the destruction our wars cause -- and if we don\u0027t know or feel that, why should we be more likely to restrain the politicians and generals when the next war looms? War without consequences is like a freebie. Why not try another?Read Post | Comments (71)Lyle Denniston, 04/05/12Adviser on Constitutional Literacy, National Constitution CenterIn today\u0027s polarized political environment, commentators can get caught up in the partisanship, and assume that government action not to their liking is necessarily driven by political bias. That borders on the silly and, at a minimum, shows a lapse of historical memory.Read Post | Comments (119)Wray Herbert, 04/05/12Author, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027Perception and sight are so crucial to putting that one has to wonder: What does the slumping Tiger see? Is it something different than the dominant Tiger saw in his heyday? New research may offer some insight on this question.Read Post | CommentsEmerson Whitney, 04/05/12Writer, reporter and artistWhile Allred\u0027s assertion of Talackova\u0027s gender as valid and important is reassuring, the argument that because Talackova has \"appropriate\" identity documents, her status as a woman is more valid than it would be without them is frustrating for many transgender and gender-variant people.Read Post | CommentsRobert Gallucci, 04/05/12President, John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur FoundationNations with nuclear material -- whether military or civilian -- must secure and eliminate stocks of highly enriched uranium and plutonium. The threat of nuclear terror is not just possible, it is quite plausible; if effective action is not taken, over time, it is probable.Read Post | CommentsEve Keller, 04/05/12Professor and Director of Graduate Studies, English Department, Fordham UniversityI sat on a pillowed bench in the Catskills. It was mid-July in the mountains: the trees were ridiculously green; the hummingbirds sipped sugar water. The prospect before me -- attempting Millie\u0027s experience at Auschwitz -- it seemed simply absurd.Read Post | CommentsMatthew Dowd, 04/05/12Political strategistDon\u0027t we want to know how Romney or Obama is going to create a better environment where women can have the choice -- to stay at home and raise a family or go to work full-time and not be judged on whether they are a good mom, or be given more flex time to do both?Read Post | CommentsKen Jacobson, 04/05/12Historically, corporations were understood to be responsible to a complex web of constituencies, including employees, communities, society at large, suppliers, and shareholders. But in the era of deregulation, the interests of shareholders began to trump all the others.Read Post | Comments (37)Cara Santa Maria, 04/04/12Science correspondent, Huffington Post; editor, Talk Nerdy to MeSynesthesia is a fascinating neurological condition that causes an individual to experience perceptual information through a sense modality that is unlinked to its source.Read Post | Comments (252)Michael B. Keegan, 04/05/12President, People For the American WayHatch\u0027s claim is ridiculous. In fact, it is right-wing politicians and pundits who keep on \"warning\" us that Democrats will attack Romney\u0027s faith -- and then use those \"warnings\" as opportunities to slam Mormonism themselves.Read Post | Comments (51)Doon Baqi, 04/04/12Army Officer, Paratrooper, Actor, Writer, Lawyer-in-trainingBringing in Daniel Craig seemed a subtle departure from the other Bonds. But, even in going more gruff, he still drank martinis, the proverbial tonic of refinement. Well, my devoted Bond comrades, it\u0027s all about to end. He is ditching the martini for a Heineken.Read Post | Comments (127)Sandra Steingraber, 04/05/12Authority on environmental links to healthWhy should cancer patients in the United States and Canada -- and those who love or diagnose them -- care about a report about looming water shortages in distant countries such as South Africa and Argentina?Read Post | CommentsBarbara Holm, 2012. 5.04Richard Burden, 2012. 5.04Victoria Coren, 2012. 5.04Hilary Wardle, 2012. 5.04Labrinth, 2012. 5.04Martin Dorey, 2012. 5.04Suzi Perry, 2012. 5.04Nemone Metaxas, 2012. 5.04Anna Nekaris, 2012. 5.04Conor Marron, 2012. 5.04","h1":"Using a mobile device?
