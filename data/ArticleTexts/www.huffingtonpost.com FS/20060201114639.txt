{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"From cnn.com*17 mentions of \"freedom\" from the guy obsessed with assaulting it here at home. *We also heard him mention \"weapons of mass murder\". WMM. That\u0027s apparently the new WMD. *The president also brought back that old chestnut, the line item veto. This from a man who has yet to veto a single bill. In over five years in office. I guess the line item veto was this year\u0027s voyage to Mars. *Lots of talk about isolationism. Bush is clearly afraid that the American DNA is so solidly against imperial adventures that protecting the U.S. homeland first is going to become a huge populist issue -- if only some Democrat would take it up. READ MOREThe Democratic Response: My Worst Fears Realized All my worst fears about the Democratic response to the State of the Union address being given by Virginia Gov Kaine were realized tonight when he completely failed to take on the president on his greatest vulnerability -- the war in Iraq. READ MOREREAD POST | comments (36)02.01.2006 Nora EphronSo I had to fall back on my fallback position and try instead to watch the speech. But of course that can\u0027t really be done. It\u0027s not possible. Everyone attempts to. Everyone is dutiful. But everyone is just faking it.READ POST | comments01.31.2006 Sen. Harry ReidIt wasn\u0027t credible to hear the President talk about making America more secure and honoring our troops without hearing him explain why he\u0027s done the opposite for the last five years.READ POST | comments (26)01.31.2006 Bob CescaThank God the president had the resolve to take on the gathering Pig Man threat. America faces a new kind of enemy -- the human-animal hybrid or \"chimera.\" While you sleep tonight, they\u0027re moving. They\u0027re lurking.READ POST | comments (13)01.31.2006 Sen. Russ FeingoldMy first reaction to the President\u0027s speech is that we didn\u0027t hear anything new, and we didn\u0027t get any real answers.READ POST | comments (21)02.01.2006 Nina BurleighSafety.

Snap out of it.READ POST | comments02.01.2006 Robert ScheerThe trial of Ken Lay and Jeffrey Skilling opens a new window on the outrageous practices of our modern-day robber barons. But the politicians who benefited from Lay\u0027s largesse and changed the law enabling Enron\u0027s chicanery are going unpunished and even uncriticized.READ POST | comments01.31.2006 Harry ShearerRe: Gov. Kaine: maybe he\u0027s bucking for a cabinet position when Karl Rove decides it\u0027s time to let a Democrat on board to help with the heavy bailing.READ POST | comments (12)01.31.2006 Paul RieckhoffIt is a callous thing to say, reducing the family of a fallen Marine to the designated hitters for a stubborn agenda, but much more than that, it\u0027s a callous thing to do.READ POST | comments01.31.2006 Rep. Nancy PelosiThe State of the Union showed that once again, the President is choosing lobbyists and special interests over the American people. Last year, it was Social Security; this year, it\u0027s Health Savings Accounts.READ POST | comments (26)01.31.2006 Trey EllisI can do without the predictable reaction shots, however. Mention \"Coretta Scott King\" cut to various black politicians. Mention \"Israel\" and who do we see but Senator Lieberman.READ POST | comments02.01.2006 Katrina vanden HeuvelBipartisanship, n. 1. When conservative Republicans work with moderate Republicans to pass legislation that Democrats hate. Staying the Course, v.

What else is on?READ POST | comments01.31.2006 Rep. Rush HoltAs a scientist I\u0027ve been urging for years that we do more in the area of science and math education. The comments of the President tonight would sound good if you did not know the history of his budgets and legislation.READ POST | comments01.31.2006 Rep. John ConyersBush has succeeded mightily in turning this speech into the most irrelevant exercise of our political life because you know that no matter what he says that appears to be new, he will continue to do exactly what he has been doing.READ POST | comments (14)01.31.2006 HuffPost EditorsWe\u0027ve created this open thread where you can sound off on the State of the Union.
