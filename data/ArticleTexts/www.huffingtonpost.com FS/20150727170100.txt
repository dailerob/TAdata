{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"LONDON -- Marhaba from London, where we\u0027re launching HuffPost Arabi, our 14th international edition, in partnership with Wadah Khanfar and Integral Media Strategies. While all of our other editions around the world focus on one country, HuffPost Arabi will span the entire Arab World -- comprised of 377 million people living in 22 countries, stretching from Mauritania in the northwest corner of Africa to Oman on the eastern tip of the Arabian Peninsula. So much coverage of the Arab World is from the outside looking in, and the voices of the people most affected by what\u0027s happening are frequently unheard. Our original reporting by independent journalists will showcase the richness of the Arab world -- political debates and business news, but also arts and cultures, religions and traditions, food and human stories. And I\u0027m particularly excited about HuffPost Arabi\u0027s blog platform, where anyone with something to say can share their perspective (in text, video or image) on any subject from politics and religion to cooking, poetry, recipes and personal stories.On the happy occasion of the Huffington Post Arabi launch, I truly hope that we reach for new horizons. I hope that we build it hand in hand with our Arab audience and that with the site we open a door for communication, hope, and gripping, valuable content.President of Sharq Forum and former director general of the Al Jazeera NetworkAt some point, a scientist must say it is time to stop waffling so much and say that the evidence is pretty strong. In my opinion, we have reached that point on the sea level issue. We have a global crisis, an emergency that calls for global cooperation to reduce emissions as rapidly as practical.ClimatologistMy brother died in a car crash when he was 18 and my family never really recovered from it. I can\u0027t begin to imagine the Prescott family\u0027s pain. We live in a world that makes it very, very difficult to be trans.Public speaker, activist, OlympianHere we are, in the throes of an internecine war that birthed our new journalistic child, Huffington Post Arabi, full of freedom, challenges and bursting with life and the passion to find answers and solutions, searching for joy wherever it may be -- as all children of war do.Editor in Chief, HuffPost ArabiSocial Security demonstrates that public systems are often better than their private counterparts -- more transparency, fewer middlemen, less opportunism. The problem is that government-managed systems are only as good as their stewards, and one of our two major parties hates government.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027This past weekend the noise over the Clinton State Department emails erupted again as Senate hearing dates were announced. But, ironically thanks to Donald Trump, the average American\u0027s response was, \"Oh yeah, I forgot about that.\"Television political commentator, radio talk show host, lecturer, political analystGilead Sciences is an American pharmaceutical company driven by unquenchable greed. The company is causing hundreds of thousands of Americans with Hepatitis C to suffer unnecessarily and many of them to die as the result of its monopolistic practices, while public health programs face bankruptcy.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia UniversityWe believe that not only is it possible to find options that align with your values, but also that by continuing to support these alternatives, we can grow those supply chains and industries which are effectively and transparently making sustainable improvements in their supply chain.Co-founder, JUSTYou\u0027ll worry less about day-to-day problems and focus on what is most important. As you become more mindful, you will be a more effective, successful and fulfilled leader. That\u0027s worth twenty minutes a day, isn\u0027t it?Professor of Management Practice, Harvard Business SchoolNutrition and sleep are both hot areas of research right now, and recent studies have found that what we eat affects how we sleep, and that in turn, how we sleep can affect what we eat.Writer, Content Manager at AmerisleepWe have a problem in this country called gun violence and we\u0027re not going to solve it by \u0027fixing\u0027 a registration system that hasn\u0027t changed in more than 20 years; it\u0027s not going to be solved by putting the discussion off for another day; and it\u0027s certainly not going to be solved by asking every law-abiding citizen to walk around with a gun.Mike the Gun GuyAsking the black community for forgiveness can now only come through a revamping of an inconsistent police force and a reexamination of an unjust justice system that has become so dysfunctional that it has failed so many Americans.Founder and Chairman: The Second Half Foundation and Centre; Author, The Second Half of Your LifeWith religious liberty under siege around the world, people of goodwill should stand for the rights of believers everywhere. Unpopular minority faiths are like the proverbial canary in the mine: When they die, further violations of human life and dignity inevitably are coming.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteFor Trump, August 6 in Cleveland is just one more installment of a reality TV show that has been a ratings phenom all summer long. So how should the others approach Trump?Professor of Journalism, Northeastern University, BostonThere is no guarantee that what you do will yield what you want. The only guarantee is that as long as you are alive and conscious, you can respond to your circumstances in pursuit of your goals. Response-ability is a direct expression of rationality and free will. Being human is being response-able.Founder and Chairman, Conscious Business Center InternationalOn Saturday, President Obama announced that OPIC plans to join Goldman Sachs\u0027 10,000 Women and IFC in the first-ever global finance facility dedicated to women-owned SMEs. Our hope is that many other investors and governments around the world will join this effort.Executive Vice President and CEO, International Finance CorporationHead, Goldman Sachs’ Impact Investing business; President, Goldman Sachs FoundationPresident and CEO of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the U.S. Government\u0027s Development Finance InstitutionThere has been a lot of talk about who has won and who has lost in the recent negotiations on the Greek debt crisis, about who is strong and who is weak in Europe, who is cruel to whom and who has dictated what. This whole discussion, in my mind, misses the point. Europe, especially Germany, wants a strong Greece.German Ambassador to the U.S.In the first stage of the Opium War, the British Empire took over the island of Hong Kong. The colorful governor, Sir John Bowring, declared: \"Free trade is Jesus Christ, and Jesus Christ is free trade.\"Author, \u0027Children of the Days: A Calendar of Human History\u0027Fifty years ago in 1965, President Lyndon Johnson signed Medicare and Medicaid into law, creating two programs that would disproportionately improve the lives of older and low-income Americans, especially women. Fast forward to 2015, and both are very much under siege.Money Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsDonald Trump says exactly what the GOP believes. It\u0027s a simple axiom: personal wealth accumulation is everything. It\u0027s just that when The Donald expresses their credo, he ignores the shinola and emphasizes the crass.International President, United SteelworkersAnger isn\u0027t bad in and of itself. It is just a feeling, not a moral position. If you want to be successful as a leader today, you must come to terms with anger and figure out ways to move it in a direction of good. And like the peace movements, use anger to stop wars, and not start them.Political strategistIf you are in the Gulf of Mexico region and order \"shrimp,\" most people expect to be paying for local, gulf-caught shrimp. In fact, you may end up eating farmed shrimp from halfway around the world.CEO, OceanaActor; board member, OceanaSen. Sanders, there is one issue that you must progress greatly on if you wish to become the president that America needs in 2016. That issue is racial justice. Saying that racism exists in your next speech or adding #blacklivesmatter to the end of your next tweet is not enough.Student, writer, activistThe fight here is not about religious freedom. The courts have already determined what is and isn\u0027t covered, and arguments like the one presented by Jeremy Tedesco show an ignorance to the facts in order to feign oppression.Political blogger, Detroit NewsIn a country that respected its own claims to be free, Sandra Bland would never have gone near the jail cell where she died. It is heartbreaking that it has taken another black death to concentrate our attention on the abuse of power that took her there: an abuse that is totally unacceptable and also utterly ordinary.Professor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027Every once in a while, I\u0027d say something so vile and disgusting that it would in fact get a rise and manage to disgust even me. This is about where the Republicans find themselves these days. Insulting foreigners, brown people, gays, veterans, and each other.Richard Zombeck is a freelance writer for hire and a contributor to www.nowitcounts.comAccording to Senator Cruz, if you like a decision, the court is terrific and doing our country a great favor. But if you disagree with a decision, the court is an imperialist body of out-of-touch, snooty elitists.Professor of Theater, Ursinus CollegeWhite people, no matter how nice, how good, how desirous of honest equality, can only understand so much of something they cannot viscerally experience. I know because I thought I knew... until I discovered how little I actually did.Sass \u0026 SensibilityIf you\u0027re sitting on the toilet reading this, it\u0027s high time you squatted instead. Though little practiced in the United States, crouching down on the commode is how most of the world has pooped into antiquity. And science is starting to catch up.Author of Misadventures of a Parenting Yogi: Cloth Diapers, Cosleeping, and My (Sometimes Successful) Quest for Conscious ParentingFor 28 years Dr. Joe Marshall has been saying and acting on the basis that Black lives, Hispanic lives, young lives on the streets of San Francisco and surrounding communities matter.
