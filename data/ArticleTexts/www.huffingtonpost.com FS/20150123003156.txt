{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior writer, Moyers \u0026 Company on public TV. Senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.With a president too often bold in words but timid in action facing a Congress more Republican and obstructionist than ever, little will get done to fix inequality. Even the Tea Partiers who howled in protest over the bailout of the big banks back in 2008 have been taken to the woodshed by the likes of Karl Rove, and are silent as establishment Republicans complete the return of the GOP as Guardians of the One Percent. For now, don\u0027t really expect further taxes on the wealthy that could help those at the bottom. (And did you hear much discussion of America\u0027s poor people at the State of the Union?) Funny how trickle-down economics, a concept beloved by the GOP and its plutocratic allies, as well as by corporate Democrats, become an abomination when the galoshes are on the other foot and favor the less well off. Suddenly, trickle-down becomes all wet.My decision about whether to engage from the outside or seek elected office came down to a single question: how best can I fight for a level playing field at this point?California Philanthropist \u0026 Climate ChampionFor most of us, access to safe drinking water and sanitation is something to which we give little thought. Yet the reality for nearly 750 million people is vastly different.ActorOn yet another anniversary of Roe, women\u0027s health opponents in Congress will mark the occasion by voting for a national ban on abortion at 20 weeks. Even if the ban fails, the right under Roe will still not be realized for millions of women.Executive Director of the National Health Law ProgramDid you know that coastal activity in Atlantic states -- ranging from fishing, tourism, recreation and more -- supports about 1.4 million jobs and net about $95 billion in gross domestic product every year?Producer, How To Make Money Selling DrugsCEO, OceanaFathers are, in the words of researchers, \"gatekeepers\" of their daughter\u0027s ambitions. Father\u0027s have to put in the time at home doing chores with their kids, especially daughters. Paying lip service to \"equality\" isn\u0027t good enough.Feminist, writer, and satirist (not always in that order)The speech is six years and three elections too late -- literally behind the times.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghIt\u0027s become almost routine -- the prosecutions of alleged al Qaeda operatives and spokespeople, men picked up halfway across the world brought to downtown Manhattan, where they\u0027re tried for acts they\u0027re alleged to have committed years ago in cahoots with Osama bin Laden.Senior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstOn January 28, it will be 90 days since diabetes Type 1 became a part of my 8-year-old daughter\u0027s life.Senior Editor, HuffPost VocesIf you want to know the current state of the Republican Party, look no further than the activities that the party\u0027s leading presidential hopefuls have planned for this weekend. They are scrambling to win the support of theocrats, bigots and anti-immigrant extremists. What they don\u0027t seem to realize is that that will make it much harder for them to win the respect of the rest of us.President, People For the American WayMost human rights advocates would agree that jailing people indefinitely without trial, at times in solitary confinement or other harsh conditions, is hard to justify. The biggest problem with Obama\u0027s call to close the military prison at Gitmo is that it doesn\u0027t go far enough.Editor, Latino VoicesA world without Jews indeed would not be a world. A world in which the Jews once again became the scapegoats for all people\u0027s fears and frustrations would be a world in which free people could not breathe easy and the enslaved would be even more enslaved.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.The subject of competence is a sore spot for career CIA employees proud of their hard-boiled affects. From their vantage points, it can\u0027t be expunged by dismissing critics as impractical idealists and bleeding hearts merely concerned with the morality of drones, torture or renditions.Author, \u0027War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death\u0027We all circle through our lives with the false impression we\u0027re alone in our personal experiences. A lack of shared stories keeps all of us in the dark about how something can affect so many people, especially a subject so shamed as abortion.1 in 3 CampaignThe upcoming elections in Greece are undeniably a global event, whose importance transcends Greece\u0027s borders.Editor-At-Large, HuffPost GreeceBetween the time the wars start and the movies begin coming out, for God\u0027s sake pay attention. Follow the news enough to know that Arab allies are helping us and snipers aren\u0027t cowards doing an easy job. How can you support the troops if you don\u0027t understand what they do?Novelist, journalist, Iraq and Afghanistan veteran, retired Air National Guard senior master sergeantI was now 98 pounds, and spiraling downward rapidly. Normal body functions stopped. Blood pressure plummeted, bones protruding, clothes were anchored on with huge safety pins so they wouldn\u0027t fall off.Teacher in IdahoI\u0027m that girl. I take photos of brunch and post them on Instagram. I\u0027ll roll down the cab\u0027s window as we drive over the bridge and take a picture of Manhattan\u0027s skyline. I experiment with filters and will spend more time playing with a photo\u0027s saturation and contrast than you might find appropriate.Editor, Huffington Post TechThere is a story of catatonic patients who briefly wake up after being injected with a trial drug, before returning to catatonia. The same awakening could be true for the gathering of elite business leaders every year in Davos at the World Economic Forum.General Secretary, International Trade Union ConfederationIn the wake of the 2014 midterm elections, the capital is said to be a big government town being taken over by smaller government types -- not, however, if you\u0027re talking about the national security state.Editor, TomDispatch.comWhile President Obama\u0027s \"middle class economics\" speech last night certainly laid down a few markers for Democrats in 2016 and beyond, the real reason it now seems Democrats will be playing on familiar turf comes from Republicans.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comRecently the New York Times published the latest in its series of sub-par articles on the current racial justice movement. Like its predecessors, this installment dutifully reinforces conventional wisdom that does not stand up to challenge.Scholar, Organizer, InstigatorThe sports world is buzzing about allegations that the New England Patriots may have doctored footballs to gain an advantage in the AFC championship game.Anchor and reporterJust because you order a salad when you go out, (while thinking you are being virtuous), does not necessarily mean that it is good for your waistline. The mantra \"I\u0027ll just have a salad\" can be a dieter\u0027s dream or a diet disaster depending on what goes into that salad.Internationally-recognized nutritionist; International Speaker; Adjunct professor of nutrition at NYU; Author, \u0027The Portion Teller Plan\u0027Now the company has taken another delusional turn. Since it lost the game in the open marketplace it wants the government to step in and MANDATE that all apps in the iPhone Appstore and the Google Play store must be replicated for Blackberry.EntrepreneurWhile both federal and state criminal laws both require a finding that cases be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, the federal law requires more elements be proven to that high evidence standard.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityAt no other time since the API was introduced in 2002 by Saudi Arabia has the development of events in the region converged to create a new environment, making the API more relevant than before; Israel must urgently adopt it as the basis for peace negotiations.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUThe counterintuitive romance is one in which two people who truly shouldn\u0027t fall in love do, often under extraordinary and unromantic circumstances. The protagonists of these love stories breathe the same thin air as anti-heroes and outsiders; they are, in short, unidealized and identifiably human. We\u0027ve compiled six romance films that fit this profile.Editor, bestmoviesbyfarr.comThe lack of education and discussion about sex and sexuality is a problematic issue recurring in my community and others. We were indirectly taught our whole lives to just shut up, keep our legs closed, and not ask questions.Coming of Faith believes in the power of stories.New Yorkers spend most of their time on the subway either stressing over train delays or wondering why the dude manspreading next to them is wearing a velour jumpsuit and eating a full plate of spaghetti. Straphangers abroad have similar woes, but with an added bonus: Many of their subway stations are actually nice to look at!Everything worth caring about in food, drink, and travelBefore I had children, I was the perfect parent. I knew how to do everything, solve every problem, and handle every childhood dilemma. Then I had kids and I realized I knew nothing -- absolutely nothing.writer and blogger, trustychucks.comGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"BALLS DON\u0027T LIE",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
