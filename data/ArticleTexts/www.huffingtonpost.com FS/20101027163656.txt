{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Since it launched in June 2009, HuffPost New York has been our most popular local section. But a consistent theme in the feedback we\u0027ve gotten is the desire for more information that helps New Yorkers connect to their city. New Yorkers want to be in the know about... well, everything. Where to go, what to do, and what to see. So, starting today, we\u0027re going to be adding more elements that will help make HuffPost New York a go-to guide to what\u0027s going on all over town. We\u0027ll have more coverage of restaurants, culture and entertainment, real estate, local events, and shopping deals. And since a sense of community is essential to the well-being of any city, HuffPost New York will also have more coverage of local efforts to make New York a better place to live. Give it a look and let us know what you think.Read Post | CommentsAdrian Grenier, 10.27.2010ActorBluefin tuna are some of the biggest and baddest fish in the ocean. But unfortunately, they\u0027re also among our top prey these days. Too many of us love to eat them -- particularly as sushi or sashimi.Read Post | CommentsHoward Fineman, 10.27.2010Even though Arianna is backing Jon Stewart\u0027s \"Rally to Restore Sanity,\" and even though I now work for her, I had dismissed the event this Saturday on the Mall as self-indulgent, time-wasting comedy. Until now.Read Post | CommentsDaphne Eviatar, 10.27.2010Senior Associate in Human Rights First’s Law and Security ProgramThe Obama administration has neatly washed its hands of the serious legal problems with its first military commissions trial. But it cannot so neatly solve the problem of having violated its international legal obligations.Read Post | CommentsTim Kaine, 10.27.2010Chairman, Democratic National CommitteeMy GOP counterpart has chosen to mislead American voters with baseless talking points and empty rhetoric. With only seven days until Election Day, voters deserve the truth. So I ask: Mr. Steele, what do Republicans really stand for?Read Post | CommentsRichard (RJ) Eskow, 10.27.2010Consultant, Writer, Senior Fellow with The Campaign for America\u0027s FuturePissing off Alan Simpson may not be the most high-minded motive for executing one\u0027s civic duty, but like they say: Whatever works.Read Post | CommentsChris Mooney, 10.27.2010Chris Mooney is the author of Unscientific America (www.unscientificamerica.com).Far fewer Americans today describe scientific innovations as among the country\u0027s top achievements -- 27 percent in 2009 versus 47 percent a decade earlier. These kinds of statistics have consequences.Read Post | CommentsScott Atran, 10.26.2010Anthropologist; Author, \u0027Talking to the Enemy: Faith, Brotherhood, and the (Un)Making of Terrorists\u0027The U.S. should turn the current shadow play about talks with the Taliban into serious negotiations. Older Taliban leaders might well drop support for Bin Laden if we were no longer there to unite them in defense of their homeland.Read Post | CommentsDylan Loewe, 10.27.2010Speechwriter, Author of Permanently BlueJust as in 1946, the Republican party of 2010 is poised to regain the majority while still staggeringly weak -- and without a strategy for governing going forward.Read Post | CommentsJoy Yoon, 10.27.2010Editor-At-Large, The New Order MagazineThough they aren\u0027t cheap, an investment in a pair of custom Esquivel\u0027s will help you understand and appreciate the quality and craftsmanship of a handmade shoe.Read Post | CommentsRobert Teitelman, 10.27.2010Editor-in-Chief, \"The Deal\"According to last week\u0027s Bloomberg Businessweek, Americans \"broadly\" favor \"the need for a more equal distribution of wealth,\" but we consistently overestimate how equitable American society is -- and by rather striking numbers.Read Post | CommentsDerrick Crowe, 10.26.2010Political Director, Brave New FoundationA new report out today by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction gives lie to the Pentagon\u0027s assertion of a \"comprehensive civil and military effort\" in Kandahar.Read Post | CommentsHeidi Hartmann, 10.27.2010President, Institute for Women’s Policy ResearchA report released last Thursday by the White House makes an excellent case that women have benefited greatly from the policies and programs advanced by the Obama administration and the Democratic Congress.Read Post | CommentsSusan Shapiro Barash, 10.27.2010Author, Blogger for \"Friend or Foe\" at Psychology TodayIf you are busy being your daughter\u0027s friend, you certainly aren\u0027t protecting her, whether she is 10, 20 or 30 years old. It takes guts to stand one\u0027s ground; it takes courage to be a mother, to be harsher, stricter, tougher.Read Post | CommentsJoseph A. Palermo, 10.27.2010Associate Professor, American History, California State University, SacramentoThe economic meltdown that short-sighted \"free market\" policies brought upon us has now given the rich and powerful the opening to push their advantage more aggressively than ever.Read Post | CommentsEve Ensler, 10.27.2010Author of \u0027I Am An Emotional Creature\" and \"The Vagina Monologues\u0027It happens like this. The doctor walks towards me. His face is ashen. He says we have found something. It does not look good.Read Post | CommentsJohn Petro and Noah Budnick, 10.27.2010Voters want to know: which candidate for governor will finally bring the MTA\u0027s finances under control? Unfortunately, all they\u0027ve heard from Cuomo and Paladino is outdated rhetoric.Read Post | CommentsRobert Scheer, 10.27.2010Editor of Truthdig.com, Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027Our military investments recruit rather than combat terrorists, but that is not a bad outcome if the goal is greater instability as an excuse to keep defense spending absurdly high despite the end of the Cold War two decades ago.Read Post | CommentsMatt Sledge, 10.27.2010Associate blog editorSo much for the the savvy, take-charge CEO persona Jay-Z likes to present to the world. A new report suggests that he was little more than a hype man for New York\u0027s Aqueduct Entertainment Group bid.Read Post | CommentsSusan Smalley, Ph.D., 10.27.2010Professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences at UCLAHow you think and feel emotionally can contribute to your physical health and well-being -- it\u0027s just that simple.Read Post | CommentsNick Gillespie and Matt Welch, 10.26.2010Despite similarities to liquor prohibition, the drug war actually functions more like the Cold War used to. It\u0027s an almost-hidden, infrequently debated structuring device that affects every aspect of American politics, culture, and society.Read Post | CommentsDan Pfeiffer, 10.27.2010White House Communications DirectorLast week, as special interests continued to pour secret donations into front groups supporting Republicans, we asked the obvious question: \"What do they expect in return?\" Today we found out they\u0027re already drawing up the plans.Read Post | CommentsNomi M. Stolzenberg, 10.26.2010While there is broad agreement that the prohibition on state \"establishment\" of religion implies some sort of separation between religion and politics, it has always been open to interpretation just what form of separation is required.Read Post | CommentsChris Matthews, 10.26.2010Television news anchorIf you run for office, you\u0027re pretty much completely exposed. Yet every election, people line up to take the public manhandling. And the simple fact is we need these people -- need them there on the ballot, need some of them as our leaders.Read Post | CommentsDavid Sirota, 10.26.2010Newspaper columnist, radio host (AM760), bestselling authorWhen labor leaders in Washington aggressively back anti-labor Democrats and/or refuse to follow up their own threats with action, those labor leaders are destructively undermining the political agenda of their rank-and-file membership.Read Post | CommentsTammy Tibbetts, 10.27.2010President, She\u0027s the FirstTo me, social media is not an endless pit of oversharing. You can make it a well-curated feed of the news that is most important to you, and you can surround yourself with people who inspire and inform you.Read Post | CommentsDouglas LaBier, 2010.10.27Andy Plesser, 2010.10.27Lauren Selman, 2010.10.27Caitlin Colford, 2010.10.27Michael Winship, 2010.10.27Joy Yoon, 2010.10.27Kerry Saretsky, 2010.10.27Scott Edwards, 2010.10.27Paul Szep, 2010.10.27Andy Plesser, 2010.10.27","h1":"Using a mobile device?
