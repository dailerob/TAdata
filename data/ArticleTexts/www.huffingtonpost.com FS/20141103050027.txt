{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Barring a miracle, Tuesday is likely to be an unhappy Election Day for the Democrats. They will need to win virtually every close race to hold the Senate, and that seems unlikely. They are on track to suffer losses in the House as well. Could it have been different? I think so. Working against the Democrats is the six-year jinx. Six years into an incumbent\u0027s tenure, the president\u0027s party almost always loses seats in Congress. The Republicans got clobbered in Eisenhower\u0027s sixth year, 1958, and in Bush II\u0027s sixth year, 2006. Even Franklin Roosevelt\u0027s Democrats lost massively in his sixth year, 1938. Can you guess the one recent exception? It was Bill Clinton in 1998 -- right after the Lewinsky sex scandal and Clinton\u0027s impeachment, no less. The Dems actually picked up five House seats. How on earth did the wily Clinton and the Dems pull off that feat?The \"conventional wisdom\", as projected by some former U.S. officials and pro-Israel groups, is that Israelis will only make peace when they are given everything they want and feel secure. In fact, the opposite is true. It is only external pressure -- especially from the U.S. -- that historically has forced Israelis to make the right choice.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027In the early hours of Election Day, before dawn reaches the nation\u0027s capital, Justice Anthony Kennedy is suddenly awakened by someone standing next to his bed. \"Who are you?\" demands the Justice. \"I am the ghost of Election Day Past.\"Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027It\u0027s now possible to see how states are faring in their early vote compared to 2010. More than 17 million people have voted in the 2014 election. As the early vote pulls into the station, it is time to interpret the meaning of these numbers.Associate Professor, University of FloridaAs most of you know, I am not a fan of diets. The reason is that we follow a certain diet for a while, and then we fall off the wagon as we are unable to sustain it, and so often, end up discouraged. Better to adopt a healthy lifestyle you can sustain for the long haul.Nationally-recognized nutritionist; International Speaker; Adjunct professor of nutrition at NYU; Author, \u0027The Portion Teller Plan\u0027Election forecasts report a margin of error of typically 3 percentage points. That means that 95 percent of the time the election outcome should lie within that interval. However, the true error is actually much larger than that.EconomistSo go ahead and hashtag your devotion, but learn the cause. Above all, think collectively -- meaning outside your own personal needs. Think about the needs of your sisters around the word and for generations to come.Author of Beautiful Garbage: A Novel, and Professor of EnglishMatalin and LaMarche debate what\u0027s driving Tuesday\u0027s vote and what it implies for the winner-take-all 2016 contest. Also: can an unapologetic bully get elected president?Recovery is not negotiable. You can either make time to rest and rejuvenate now or make time to be sick and injured later. Keep your bucket full.Entrepreneur, weightlifter, and travel photographer at http://jamesclear.comFar too many of us spend our time paddling around in the shallow things of life instead of heading straight for the deeps. We get tangled up on the sandbars of the shallow waters of life, dissipating our energies on the trivial. This is especially relevant now as people prepare to vote in the election of this coming Tuesday, November 4.AuthorUntil one year ago we were perceived as an ordinary family when it came to composition: husband, wife and kids. But when my other half expressed to the world that she is a woman and would start presenting herself as a woman, the news surprised some, shocked most and unraveled a series of fortunate and unfortunate events.Manager in engineering, wife, mother of two girls, mentor of students and engineers and STEM outreach volunteerWhat\u0027s the matter with Kansas? A decade ago, a best-selling book of that title examined how Kansas veered rightward after a long history as a left-wing hotbed. It looks like Kansas may be shifting course again.Attorney; USA Today Columnist, NBCNews.com ContributorAll across the country right-wing candidates with extreme, outdated views on women\u0027s rights are running for seats in the U.S. Senate and calling for the passage of \"personhood\" bills and amendments.U.S. Representative for New York\u0027s 12th District; Ranking House Member, Joint Economic CommitteeRepublicans in 2011 and 2013 voted to transform Medicare into a voucher program. And, yet these same Republicans are attacking Democrats who fought for these popular programs, who sometimes lost their seats due to signaling a willingness to compromise.Last person on Earth not on FacebookIf the decision not to quarantine civilians returning from Ebola-stricken areas is based on science, as the president and the head of the Centers For Disease Control insist it is, why is the federal government willing to pay military members for three weeks of unnecessary confinement, keeping them from essential duties?Spouse Calls, Stars and StripesMoms, your vote counts because you vote with your children and family at heart. Showing up at the polls or staying home can make the difference between electing a candidate who shares your priorities and sending one to Washington who doesn\u0027t.Principal at theGROUPMake no mistake that what has happened in this country is a \"coup\", planned, not by foreign or domestic military forces, but rather orchestrated by Grover Norquist, the Koch brothers and their very wealthy cohorts as a domestic moral and financial coup.Maryland Lawyer, U.S. Army veteranEmpire builders appear to be back in style. They are with us today both in reality and in fantasy. They present the world with the same dilemma that has troubled victims in the past -- how does the rest of the planet deal with them.Author and Fellow at the Century FoundationVoters in many communities continue to be subjected to wave after wave of negative political ads. The obvious solution is to take big money out of politics, but another tactic would be to promote bipartisanship, to somehow dispel the rancor between Democrats and Republicans. Is bipartisanship possible? Or is the U.S. too polarized?Berkeley writer, retired Silicon Valley executiveMy kids are eating all of their Halloween candy right now. Don\u0027t worry -- it\u0027s not like that. As we all know, however, trick-or-treating produces a Candy Situation. My kids aren\u0027t strangers to treats, but the onslaught of Kid Crack was overwhelming to me.
