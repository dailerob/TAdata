{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOMany, including me, have written extensively about how lobbying consistently waters down or out-and-out kills reform. We\u0027ve pointed fingers, named names, and fanned the flames of outrage. And yet the lobbyists are more powerful than ever. Stories about lobbyists undermining reform tend to pop up, make our blood pressure rise, then quickly drop off the media radar until the next outrage grabs our attention. Which is why we are launching HuffPost\u0027s LobbyBlog, an ongoing, consistently refreshed collection of the latest information on lobbying, lobbyists, and the tragic impact they are having on our lives -- served up with a heaping helping of attitude by HuffPost\u0027s Jason Linkins. And we want you to play a big part in putting it together. We also want you to play a big part in helping us create a better Misery Index, what we are calling The Real Misery Index.
