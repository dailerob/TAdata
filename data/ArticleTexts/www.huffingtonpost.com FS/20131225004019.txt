{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Congress and the president have decided to craft budgets that lead to tens of millions of people being unemployed or underemployed. High levels of unemployment put downward pressure on workers\u0027 wages, especially those in the bottom third of the labor force. This means we have a federal budget that limits growth and employment in a way that redistributes income upwards. So, inequality didn\u0027t just happen; it was the result of government policy. That is why people who actually want to see inequality reduced, and for poor and middle class to share in the benefits from growth, are not likely to be very happy about President Obama\u0027s speech on the topic. His comment about the government being a bystander ignores the real source of the problem. Therefore it is not likely that he will come up with much by way of real solutions.Comments (104)Trevor TimmExecutive Director, Freedom of the Press FoundationEvery American should be outraged that leakers and whistleblowers are being prosecuted under an espionage statute without ever having to show they meant to harm the U.S. or that any harm actually occurred.Comments (65)Andrew PleplerGlobal Corporate Social Responsibility and Consumer Policy Executive, Bank of AmericaAs we near the height of the holiday spending season, I will risk being what my teenage son calls a \"buzzkill\" by asking: Do you have healthy money habits?CommentsRobert CreamerPolitical Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersOver the last decade the far right, that now dominates the GOP, has conducted a real war on the values that we celebrate at Christmas.Comments (152)Jeffrey LaurentiInternational affairs analyst and commentatorIncomprehensibly, John Kerry was not on Time\u0027s short list. The U.S. secretary of state may not deal with cosmic truths, but by any secular standard Kerry has, in one short year, justifiably laid claim to the blessings the gospels promise to peacemakers.CommentsGary HartUnited States Senator (Ret.)Safe landings are not news; crashes are news. But we must not be left without hope. For many of us, what makes life worthwhile is to focus on safe landings and those who make a difference every day, every year. Today my heart is full of gratitude for the lives of a surprising number of heroes I have been privileged to know.CommentsIsiah ThomasNBA Hall of FamerWe owe it to our children and ourselves to demand higher expectations and a system where all stakeholders, from the state house to the school house are held accountable when it comes to education.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorHealth coverage is not cheap, because health care is not cheap. In the interest of sustainability, we have to implement some version of reform to squeeze inefficiencies out of the system. Some will pay more, though they will often get more coverage for their extra bucks. Many -- post subsidy -- will pay less.Comments (285)Rep. Barbara LeeU.S. Representative, California\u0027s 13th congressional districtI know firsthand how important this type of assistance can be to families on the edge. In the 1970s, when I was a student trying to raise two boys as a single mother, I was on public assistance. I know I would not be where I am today as a member of Congress if it were not for the generosity that the American people.CommentsBrie DyasThis is it, guys. The last weekend before Christmas. Malls are open until midnight. There\u0027s an abnormal surplus of \"safe\" last-minute gifts (read: robes, commemorative ornaments and off-brand bath sets) in the front of every store. And everyone you encounter is pretty much a jerk.Comments (73)Bill GeorgeProfessor of Management Practice, Harvard Business SchoolThe latest announcement from the White House on Thursday, December 19, seems to indicate that even President Obama is backing away from Obamacare. At the very least, he is bobbing and weaving like an exhausted prize fighter trying to avoid a knockout punch.Comments (183)The Daily MealTheDailyMeal.comBy selecting options like chocolate chip or snickerdoodle, you are totally telling Santa that you love and appreciate him -- but a few wrong selections and you could be sending the complete wrong message.CommentsLinda BergtholdHealth policy researcherIf you did not sign up for health insurance by Christmas Eve this year, you are not out of luck. You can still get insured. With all the news about the Obamacare website, the deadlines, the delays, you would think that would be clear. But it could not be more confusing.CommentsJeffrey Bland, Ph.DPresident, Personalized Lifestyle Medicine InstituteI believe that the announcement by the FDA of the approval of the genome sequencing technology for medical applications is symbolic for the future development of personalized health care.CommentsKaren PapernoOwner, Boing BoingMine has become a neighborhood of excess and ease while I have sunk into poverty. Here I am, the owner of a shop in the epicenter of the baby universe, and I can\u0027t make my rent. I just want people to know how some of us are hiding in plain sight, serving you with a smile while our gut lurches with hunger and anxiety.Comments (60)Ben HallmanSenior Financial Writer, The Huffington PostThe highest-paid state employee in Alabama just got another massive raise. And for that he can thank many of his own laborers, who make almost nothing.Comments (58)Angie HicksFounder and Chief Marketing Officer, Angie\u0027s ListAs we find time to bake, prep for guests or (hopefully) relax in front of the fire or TV, many of us experience a nagging sense that something\u0027s been left undone. Call it \"house angst.\"CommentsKen ReedSports Policy Director, League of FansThe holiday season seems like a good time to talk about what\u0027s right with sports. The reason I work on sports reform issues all year is because I love what sports can be at their best.CommentsAdam GrantWharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027Studies show that the more you toot your own horn, the more negatively you\u0027re evaluated: Self-promoters are not only less liked, but also earn lower salaries and fewer promotions. Bragging about yourself violates norms of modesty and politeness -- and if you were really competent, your work would speak for itself.CommentsWendell PotterAuthor, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgNumbers show just how big the disconnect is between the reality of what\u0027s occurred in health care since Congress passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010 and the perception that people have of the law resulting from the relentless campaign of misinformation from the president\u0027s opponents.Comments (36)Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027It is possible to have principled arguments with political conservatives on a wide array of public issues, ranging from late-term abortions to privatizing Social Security. But there is no principled debate about suppressing the right to vote.Comments (38)Robert ScheerEditor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027What would Jesus do about the profound inequality of opportunity that both the pope and our president have identified as the most pressing moral crisis of our time? It is a timely question to ponder when many of us honor the purported moment of Christ\u0027s birth with a last-minute burst of shopping.Comments (37)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarCelebrity weight loss stories are called out as destructive and anti-feminist. And yet, there\u0027s something refreshing -- and, perhaps, even healthy -- about those celebrities who publicly discuss their ups and downs.CommentsRichard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureLocal politicians are taking on the big banks. Candidates for major office are adopting populist themes. But it starts at the bottom, not the top, with activists who engage with and crystallize the public\u0027s desire for justice.CommentsAndrey TolokonnikovFather of Pussy Riot Band MemberIt is a completely cynical game by the central government.CommentsBill MoyersManaging Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyThere are more African Americans under correctional control today -- in prison or jail, on probation or parole -- than were enslaved in 1850, a decade before the Civil War began.Comments (15)Gretchen WhitmerState Senator, MichiganI\u0027m one of only four women currently serving in the Michigan Senate and to say there\u0027s an \"old boys club\" mentality in our Capitol Building would be putting it mildly. So, I made the decision to put a face directly in front of them: my own.Comments (149)Caitlyn BeckerProducer, HuffPost LiveThe key to last-minute gifting is to make it look like you thought long and hard for the perfect present. Here are seven last-minute gifts that don\u0027t look like afterthoughts -- and all can be found at your local mall.Comments (17)Kathy EldonFounder and President, Creative Visions FoundationI knew I could never forgive the Somalis who killed my son. My journey to forgiveness was long and painful, but one incident was to change forever the trajectory of my life.CommentsDebbie FinkBlogger, Marketing executiveThere needs to be more support for women like me: relatively young, childless not by choice and facing cancer or some other life-impacting disease; women like me who ache every time they see a stroller or hear the delicious laugh of an infant.CommentsChristopher CrossRecording Artist, Five-Time Grammy WinnerI think the way Yacht Rock has grown, garnering fans across the world and even celebrity fans like my buddy, Jimmy Fallon, is proof the that the sound Hall \u0026 Oates played such a big part in creating is truly a page in Rock and Roll lore.Comments (17)Rebecca SolnitAuthor, \u0027A Paradise Built in Hell\u0027I don\u0027t know what\u0027s coming. I do know that, whatever it is, some of it will be terrible, but some of it will be miraculous, that term we reserve for the utterly unanticipated, the seeds we didn\u0027t know the soil held. And I know that we don\u0027t know what we do does.CommentsPaul Singer, 2013.24.12Michael Sigman, 2013.24.12Carnegie Corporation of New York, 2013.24.12Roadtrippers, 2013.24.12Viator, 2013.24.12BJ Gallagher, 2013.24.12Sandi Bachom, 2013.24.12Michele Willens, 2013.24.12Joan Lunden, 2013.24.12Rev.
