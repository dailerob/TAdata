{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027After the Democrats\u0027 drubbing in the 2014 midterm elections, there have been fervent debates about whether the Party should embrace an economic populism to tap pocketbook frustrations -- or move further to the center in the hopes of capturing more independents. One thing the Democrats did throughout Obama\u0027s nearly six years was move closer to Wall Street -- from the economic team Obama appointed, to the administration\u0027s premature embrace of deficit reduction promoted by financial moguls, to a bailout plan that shored up the biggest banks rather than breaking them up. It was this coziness with big finance that allowed the far-right Tea Party movement to paint Wall Street and Washington with the same brush -- and to capture much of the populist rage on display against Democrats in the 2010 midterms and once again on November 4. So the last thing Democrats need going forward is an even closer affinity with Wall Street, right?
