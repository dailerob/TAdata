{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, the Secret Service became a little less secret, getting a ton of ink for paying visits to prostitutes and to Ted Nugent. The hooker scandal broke when an agent who\u0027d agreed to pay $800 for sex, offered just $30 after services had been rendered. It\u0027s good to see government workers trying to save money (take note, GSA!), but that really isn\u0027t the way to do it. On the campaign trail, Mitt Romney once again failed to defuse the dog-on-car-roof controversy, conceding that if given the chance he\u0027d do things differently -- not because it was cruel but because of the flak he\u0027s received in the ensuing years. In an effort to even the playing field, Republicans trotted out a quote from Dreams From My Father in which the president remembered, as a child in Indonesia, eating dog meat. Great, now that that\u0027s a wash, can we talk about something that really matters... like Hillary guzzling beer? Or, I don\u0027t know, Afghanistan.Read Post | CommentsEdward Norton, 04/21/12Actor; Founder, CrowdriseMy parents\u0027 generation sacrificed care-free youth to carry the torch of civil rights and social equality.
