{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoCritics of the decision regard this approach as fundamentally naïve and unrealistic about what actually happens when anti-abortion protesters gather near the entrances to these facilities. These critics maintain that the image of the grandmotherly woman calmly approaching a young woman heading into the clinic in order to have an abortion and asking her if they might chat a bit about whether this is really a good idea is wholly fanciful and blinks the reality of what actually happens at these moments. In their view, a clean, simple rule, like the one enacted by Massachusetts, is a perfectly reasonable way to deal with the world as it is, rather than the world as Chief Justice Roberts imagines it to be. In the view of the critics, the more \"narrowly-tailored\" restrictions that Roberts would approve are not really responsive to the complex, highly-emotional, and often intimidating and even dangerous situations that actually arise in these settings.Whether finding new ways to open unserved markets or putting people to work modernizing our nation\u0027s infrastructure, there are many ways to create good jobs by solving some of the biggest problems facing our communities.

It disrespects parents and professionals alike.Chief Deputy WhipOur war in Iraq was fundamentally a war of choice, and it was the wrong choice -- a war fought on false pretenses and for false purposes.

Dodge FoundationI want to watch a show that criticizes our reliance on incarceration, not one that depicts a jumpsuit as an item every woman needs in her closet.

We were told the economy grew slightly in the first quarter of this year.
