{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"\"The struggle of man against power is the struggle of memory against forgetting.\" It\u0027s one of Milan Kundera\u0027s most famous lines, from his novel The Book of Laughter and Forgetting. It\u0027s one worth keeping in mind as we approach March 20, the 10th anniversary of one of the biggest disasters in the history of the United States. That was the day George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, and a team of others -- along with much of Washington and a very complicit mainstream media -- took the nation to war against Iraq. The devastating consequences of that war will continue for decades, but a full accounting has still yet to happen. Allowing the toxic mixture of lies, deception and rationalizations that led to that war to go unchallenged makes it more likely that we will make similar tragic mistakes in the future. So I hope we can use this moment to assess what really happened, to look back in order to look forward.Read Post | Comments (464)Robert L. Borosage, 03/07/13President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureCongress has only two choices. The big banks can be nationalized and treated as public utilities.
