{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"From news.yahoo.comSo now we have placed the nine Fabulous Baker Boys, plus the Justice not replaced by Harriet Miers, in some sacred circle where they will have ten minutes to tell the truth and not be called America-haters. But alas, there will be no happy ending in Iraq. Like parrots squawking \"Victory!\" and \"Finish the Job!\" and \"Achieve our Objectives!\" in a burning house, Bush and Cheney are determined to remain the punchline of a sick joke. All that lies ahead is a nightmare of slaughter, for them and for us; all paths lead to generations of instability, not just in Iraq, but across the region.READ POST | comments (35)12.06.2006 Rep. Dennis KucinichThis is the House (and Senate) that the war built. The American people voted for a new direction for Iraq - out.READ POST | comments12.06.2006 Gary HartDespite the many blanks left unfilled, the ISG effort is a very large step in the right direction. But it will be but sound and fury if President Bush does not experience a second born-again conversion.READ POST | comments (31)12.06.2006 Amy EphronI feel bad for Mary Cheney. Her name never makes it into the headline, as in today\u0027s news, \"Vice-President\u0027s Lesbian Daughter is Pregnant.\"READ POST | comments (16)12.06.2006 Barbara EhrenreichBut here it is, December already, and I\u0027ve done nothing to rate a mention on Bill O\u0027Reilly\u0027s show or even a mild rebuke from the Pope.READ POST | comments12.06.2006 Melinda HennebergerUh-oh, looks like Prime Minister Baker may not have a simple solution to the non-civil war that we are not winning (but not losing!) in his vest pocket after all.READ POST | comments12.06.2006 David SirotaVery often Democrats have their eyes first and foremost on media and financial elites, to the exclusion of grassroots organizations and the public at large.READ POST | comments12.06.2006 Jon SoltzComing just after the November mid-term elections, the bi-partisan Iraq Study Group is the second reality check President Bush and company has received in as many months.READ POST | comments12.06.2006 Hooman MajdAllow me to stand up and be counted amongst your enemies.
