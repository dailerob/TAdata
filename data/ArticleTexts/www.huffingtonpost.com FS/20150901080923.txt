{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027The financial markets have been through some wild and crazy times over the last two weeks, although it appears that they have finally stabilized. The net effect of all the gyrations is that a serious bubble in China\u0027s market seems to have been at least partially deflated. After hugely overreacting to this correction, most other markets have largely recovered. Prices are down from recent peaks, but in nearly all cases well above year-ago levels. But the stock market is really a sideshow; after all, back in 1987 the U.S. market fell by almost 25 percent for no obvious reason, with little noticeable effect on the U.S. economy. The more serious question is what is happening with the underlying economy, and there are some real issues here.We need to make sure those who do the people\u0027s work in Washington are actually doing it -- not worrying about former or future bosses at the public\u0027s expense.Democratic candidate for President; Former Secretary of State, U. S. Senator and First LadyUnited States Senator for WisconsinAmericans should not have to live in fear that they will go bankrupt if they get sick. People should not have to go without the medication they need just because their elected officials aren\u0027t willing to challenge the drug lobby. The public is fed up, and they have a right to be fed up.Democratic candidate for President, US Senator from VermontWe are wrapping up a long, cruel summer of senseless, preventable gun violence. Americans are being gunned down in our churches, schools, movie theaters, military recruitment centers, workplaces, and homes. Which is why we\u0027re turning September 10 into a national day of action to make good on our pledge to do \"whatever it takes.\"Founder, Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in AmericaTrump is often called \"crazy,\" but there is method to his madness, and that method is matched and displayed by the speaking style he employs on the stump. Even his detractors see that a large part of his appeal is that he comes across as unscripted.Davidson-Kahn Distinguished University Professor and Professor of Law at Florida International University; Floershimer Distinguished Visiting Professor of Law at Cardozo Law SchoolDemocrats are doing one of two things, and neither one of them is very impressive. Democratic candidates are either so scared of being called a tax-raiser by Republicans that they do not support changing the problem at all, or they are secretly for changing it but don\u0027t want to say it.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comFor years, women of color and low-income women have heard this patriarchal message from various messengers implying that we are naive, misguided, and lack the intellectual capacity to make personal, critical, often difficult, informed decisions about our lives in general and our bodies more specifically.Director of African American Religious Affairs, People For the American Way and People For the American Way FoundationThe collapse of the American trainee force in Syria should not come as a surprise to anyone who watched a few hundred ISIS fighters rout 30,000 Iraqi troops, who dropped their weapons and ran, abandoning the city of Mosul. This is after the Iraqi army was trained by the U.S. for 12 years.Professor of international relations, George Washington UniversityThis is the first generation of American children expected to live shorter lives than their parents. If that\u0027s not a call to action, I don\u0027t know what is.Author, Producer, AdvocateOn the surface, it looks like any other children\u0027s summer camp -- kids are running around doing sports, swimming, and lots of other fun activities. However, it\u0027s a retreat entirely for transgender children, teens, and their families.Public speaker, activist, OlympianThe Fed is famous for raising rates prematurely, seeing ghosts of inflation. But there is no inflation on the horizon -- the bigger worry is deflation. In fact, the inflation rate is well below the Fed\u0027s own target of two percent. And the Fed is the only game in town.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027This month, President Obama must decide whether the Trading With the Enemy Act still authorizes sanctions against Cuba. The act requires an annual determination by the president that a national emergency exists with respect to Cuba, one that justifies sanctions.Financial Commentator, Professor of Law, Florida International UniversityLet there be no doubt that this is the best agreement ever negotiated to block a new country\u0027s acquisition of nuclear weapons. One can quibble with some of the details at the margins of the agreement, but at its core, it is an excellent agreement.President, Washington Strategy GroupAre my examples of this style diverse? Fashion and beauty media, this one is for you. Cornrows, box braids, bantu knots, saris, dashikis and everything else that is outside of white American culture aren\u0027t new or fresh simply because you finally recognized its existence.Cultural writer based in NYC.I need to highlight the issue that underlies this debate, and has fueled the decades of hostility towards trans women of all ages -- misogyny.Executive Director, Gender Rights MarylandBRUSSELS -- While the world is focused on ISIS, the reality is that Assad\u0027s barrel bombs are the leading killer of Syrian civilians. Even the mere threat of a no-fly zone could be enough to move the Syrian crisis towards a political solution. A no-fly zone would also suffocate a central ISIS recruitment narrative by demonstrating that the West is interested in protecting Syrians.Syrian National Coalition’s Representative to the Benelux and European UnionBob Takes on Gun-Worshiping Facebook Troll; Alex Jones Reacts to Virginia By Attacking Hillary Clinton; Chez Has Had Enough of Everything; The Second Amendment is the NRA\u0027s Skeleton Key; and much more.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027We cannot make this mistake again. We cannot let this election ignore the elephant in the room again. The system is rigged. And no matter how inspiring or angry or stubborn or passionate the next president is, if he or she doesn\u0027t make fixing democracy the first priority, then as Obama told us, \"nothing else is going to change.\"Law professor, activist, possible candidate in the Democratic Primary for PresidentGiven the fragile state of abortion rights today, and the determination of those who would undo them further, Pollitt\u0027s book offers an important rallying cry. Her analysis is not perfect, but on the whole, her argument is persuasive -- and necessary.Senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of LawPublic opinion data over more than 50 years reveals a country ever less willing to restrict gun ownership, even as mass shootings and other high-profile shooting incidents continue to make news.Research Coordinator for the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research at UConnBeyond the constitutional infringements, there are other significant consequences of \"submit now-and-sue later,\" including the unavoidable loss of law enforcement legitimacy, and the cost of settlements brought by victims, a price ultimately paid by taxpayers.Attorney, former member of the New York State Assembly (1990-2000), founding partner of consulting firm the MirRam Group.\"Hey!\" my husband yelled, iPhone poised to take one last photo. They turned around, and my daughter had what I call the smile of fear. In the photo, you can see she is looking off camera -- at me. My husband snapped the picture, she turned back around and was gone.JournalistIt will be interesting to watch pro-gun zealots spin the news about how guns protect us from crime when gun sales continue to soar but so does violent crime.Mike the Gun GuyFor my contemporaries, let\u0027s remember to be more introspective, less harsh on ourselves with our follies and less aggrandizing with our accomplishments. Listen, do not compare, connect and remember -- we have a purpose.Publicist and lobbyist; President and CEO, Pae \u0027?ina Communications; Partner, The Island AgencyHis name was Bill Stewart, a courageous ABC newsman. According to published reports and to interviews conducted with journalists who covered the story, Stewart was executed by Nicaragua\u0027s National Guard during the Civil War of 1979. As a CBS News correspondent myself covering that war, I was in Nicaragua the day Stewart was killedPlaywright and former Emmy Award-winning television news journalistAs a natural optimist, I like to think that we\u0027re making headway on the poverty issue, but that does not mean we can pat ourselves on the back and unfurl the banner proclaiming \"mission accomplished.\" In fact, I would argue that any progress thus far represents the proverbial low-hanging fruit and that further advances will require even deeper commitment and more creative thinking.President, Communities In Schools, Inc.ATI is butchering that time-honored relationship. It has demanded tax abatements and special electrical rates and forced excessive overtime on weary workers. Its disdain for civic engagement is most clearly demonstrated by its decision to unlawfully lock its 2,200 skilled union workers out of their jobs on Aug. 15, despite the steelworkers\u0027 willingness to continue working.International President, United SteelworkersYou know when Trump talks about not having time for being PC and for wanting to \"make America great again\"? He means for white America. And the silent majority he refers to? And people being \"afraid\" to say things? White people. Afraid to say racist things out loud.Former teacher at Julia de Burgos Elementary School; now union activist in Philadelphia, PAIt is tragically ironic that President Obama is allowing Shell to move forward with oil drilling when the Arctic is already being impacted by climate change.President \u0026 CEO, Defenders of WildlifeWhether a woman participates in tech as an engineer, a developer, a marketer, or in some other capacity, there is room enough for all of us. It is a difficult industry that is rapidly changing, and we have no business making things even more difficult on each other.Founder/CEO, APPCityLife Inc. \u0026 Cofounder, Hautepreneurs and HauteHopesAccording to the defense minister, Australia will somehow be able to bomb ISIS targets in eastern Syria without becoming involved in the broader Syrian conflict.Research Fellow at the Lowy InstituteGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
