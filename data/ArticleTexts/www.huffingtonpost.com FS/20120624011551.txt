{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Hart International, Ltd.Who would have thought, forty years after the greatest political scandal and presidential abuse of power in U.S. history, that the Supreme Court of the United States would rule that the practices that fueled and financed that scandal were now legal? Yet that is essentially the effect of the Citizens United decision. Go ahead and take bets on how much time will pass before the tsunami of cash unleashed by Citizens United ends up in the pockets of a Watergate-like cast of break-in burglars, wiretap experts, surveillance magicians, and cyberpunks.

It\u0027s critical that we wrap our heads around this, because major tax reforms are rare and if one is coming -- and it might well be -- we can\u0027t afford to blow it.Read Post | Comments (84)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 06/22/12Author, Research Psychologist, Gender ScholarWhile many fathers of grown women still see themselves as their daughters\u0027 protectors -- which, again, is perfectly fine and understandable -- it\u0027s also necessary for a father to instill in his daughter the belief that she can be her own protector, too.Read Post | Comments (158)Chris Kelly, 06/22/12Writer, \u0027Real Time with Bill Maher\u0027I can\u0027t shake the feeling that Karen Klein should take $15,506 and give it back to the people of Greece, New York, who paid her to monitor children on a school bus.
