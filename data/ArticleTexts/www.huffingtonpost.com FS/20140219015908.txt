{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Michael BrennerSenior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghA feature of the Obama presidency has been his campaign against the American public school system, eating way at the foundations of elementary education. That means the erosion of an institution that has been one of the keystones of the Republic. The project to remake it as a mixed public/private hybrid is inspired by a discredited dogma that charter schools perform better. This article of faith serves an alliance of interests -- ideological and commercial -- for whom the White House has been point man. A president whose tenure in office is best known for indecision, temporizing and vacillation has been relentless since day one in using the powers of his office to advance the cause.Comments (253)Reza MarashiResearch Director, National Iranian American CouncilSo, now the hard part begins. It is fair to point out that the gap between technical solutions and political solutions may be too wide to bridge. However, the likely alternative -- war -- is a stark reminder for both sides that the status quo is neither in their interests nor sustainable.CommentsRev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkWhether it is Florida or any of the other 22 states with these ridiculous and incomprehensible laws on the books, we must push back aggressively and immediately.Comments (183)Allison TateWriter, mother of fourWe all need to be ready to throw ropes to other moms when we see them struggling; we are, after all, the ones who know how long the rope needs to be to reach them, because we have been there.Comments (16)Robert ScheerEditor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027The tide is turning. Yesterday\u0027s traitor is today\u0027s hero, and the brave journalists who helped Edward Snowden get the word out are at last being honored for their public service. Or so one hopes.CommentsEvelyn LeopoldVeteran journalist reporting from the United NationsMurder, enslavement, torture, rape, and enforced disappearance are just a few of the \"unspeakable atrocities\" cataloged in an unprecedented U.N. report on North Korea. In short, you can control 25 million people if you kill, maim and imprison enough of them. And if your neighbor, in this case China, cuts off escape routes.CommentsDean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Excessive CEO pay is important because it sets a pattern for pay packages throughout the economy. When mediocre CEOs of mid-size companies can earn millions or tens of millions a year, it puts upward pressure on the pay of top executives in other sectors.Comments (139)Lisa WadeProfessor of sociology based in Los AngelesResearch found that Stand Your Ground laws increase the likelihood that a homicide will be considered \"justified,\" but only in cases where a white person is accused of killing a black person.Comments (58)Alan SingerSocial studies educator, Hofstra UniversityIf enVisionMATH is adopted nationally, how much money does Pearson stand to make? And is this program even effective?CommentsGeorge LakoffAuthor, The Political Mind, Moral Politics and Don\u0027t Think of an Elephant!Charles J. Fillmore, one of the world\u0027s greatest linguists -- ever -- died last Thursday, February 13, at the age of 84 in San Francisco. He was the discoverer of frame semantics, who did the essential research on the nature of framing in thought and language.CommentsDr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarStudies have long challenged the idea that nice guys finish first. So is Fallon an anomaly? Or does he represent a shift in the balance of power between the tyrants and the team players?Comments (29)Nick TurseManaging Editor, TomDispatch.comYou don\u0027t need cybernetic eye implants and immersive propaganda portals to alter history. You don\u0027t need to wait decades to have disinformation beamed into your head. You just need a constant stream of misleading information, half truths, and fictions to be promoted, pushed, and peddled until they are accepted as fact.Comments (23)Vivek WadhwaAcademic, Researcher, Writer, EntrepreneurDropbox is clearly looking for creative people who can think outside the box and wants to make interviews more fun. The problem is that such questions are fun only for people who understand the jokes -- and who can think like the young men doing the interviews.CommentsThe Motley FoolTo Educate, Amuse \u0026 EnrichMy job requires reading a lot of financial news. It\u0027s one of my favorite parts. But it gives me a front-row seat to the downside of financial journalism: gibberish, nonsense, garbage, and drivel. And let me tell you, there\u0027s a lot of it.CommentsRobyn ScottSocial entrepreneur, author, co-founder of OneLeap \u0026 IntrosImmediately after every lecture, meeting, or any significant experience, take 30 seconds?--?no more, no less?--?to write down the most important points.CommentsIngrid NewkirkPresident and co-founder, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA)Never preachy, the film simply lays bare the facts and lets viewers interpret them. It\u0027s the same strategy that animal rights organizations have used for years: Give people the information, and let them decide. And it\u0027s working.CommentsShiza ShahidCEO and Co-Founder, The Malala FundYou have no idea where you are going, you just know you have to get your children somewhere else, somewhere they might be safe. You aren\u0027t sure if there will be food there, but there might be.CommentsBrian ShactmanAnchor and reporter for MSNBCThe usual focus: Supportive (or hard-driving) parents, transformative coaches, inspiring (or bullying) siblings. Go behind the scenes to the more banal, and you actually find some fascinating stuff. I spent some time with two people, Brent Proulx and Miha Dolinar.CommentsPenny HerscherPresident and CEO, FirstRainOur world is changing very fast, and the role of women is changing fast with it -- and, mostly, for the positive. We have more women in power, more women in the workforce, more women in control of their lives but there still aren\u0027t representative numbers of women at the top of companies.CommentsMichelle Natividad RodriguezStaff attorney, National Employment Law ProjectStable employment is a significant factor in reducing the likelihood of reoffending. Yet, research shows that having a criminal record reduces job callbacks by 50 percent.CommentsLincoln Mitchelllincolnmitchell.comJeter\u0027s place in Yankee, and indeed baseball history, is significant, but still not clear. Much of that will take shape after Jeter retires.CommentsSen. Brian Schatz and Sen. Kirsten GillibrandAs two of only a handful of U.S. Senators with young children, we understand what it\u0027s like to be working parents with family responsibilities. It\u0027s not easy. And too many middle class families around the country are struggling because the system is rigged against them.CommentsRev. Dr. Susan Brooks ThistlethwaiteProfessor of Theology, Chicago Theological SeminaryOf what value is the soul of an African American teenager? Today, in America, it seems like there is not an equality of souls, of human beings, especially when it comes to the lives of young African American men.Comments (112)Richard (RJ) EskowSenior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host, Take Action NewsWill he or won\u0027t he reprise the \"chained CPI\" cut to Social Security that he proposed in last year\u0027s budget? Nobody on his team is talking. The answer to that question could determine the financial fate of millions of Americans -- and the political fate of the president\u0027s party.Comments (38)Elizabeth DrewJournalistIt\u0027s possible that criminal charges will be brought against Christie or his aides. But much larger questions are before officials of New Jersey and the federal prosecutors investigating the various charges against Christie and his subordinates and allies.Comments (56)Nancy MitchellEditor, Apartment TherapyI heard the same thing: You only matter if you\u0027re pretty. That\u0027s the only way you will get people to pay attention to you. And I believed them, because it was true, that was what everybody thought, but it was such a lie, and I realize that now and I hate it.Comments (24)Matt YoderManaging Editor, Awful AnnouncingAfter the interview, there has been a firestorm of criticism aimed at Christin Cooper with the general consensus that she was going to keep pressing Miller until he cried on the air.Comments (21)James MooreBest selling author, TV political analystThe Texas Tribune has been hailed as a new journalism model to save the craft from collapse after the success of the Internet. But can a news outlet take huge donations from lobbyists and corporations and not be influenced?CommentsOlivia ColePoet, author, and activistElegies have been written for these families, their lost children. But I am writing an elegy for fairness, for what their deaths mean, because they mean more than funerals. They mean more than black veils and sad songs. Their deaths mean our death, a collective slow withering of the soul.CommentsMichael RussnowScreenwriter; former member, WGAW Board of Directors; former U.S. Senate aideFor all these reasons, and not just one, I\u0027m going against the grain of what appears to be the general consensus and strongly suggest that Leonardo DiCaprio deserves the Oscar this year for The Wolf of Wall Street, even more than favorite Matthew McConaughey.Comments (31)Leo W.
