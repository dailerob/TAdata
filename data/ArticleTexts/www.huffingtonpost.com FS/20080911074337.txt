When we think of King, we usually think of him as resolute and dignified. But King was also filled with a prophetic anger, especially in the later years of his life. As a leader fighting for fundamental change in this country, Obama has to be willing to show us that kind of righteous anger. I don\u0027t know about you, but when I think about what George Bush has done to this country -- and what John McCain wants to keep doing -- I consider outrage the only rational and legitimate response.

Regardless of the outcome of this thing, it\u0027s clear that half of America is falling for the same superficial trickery that gave us eight years of George W. Bush. You know the routine.Read Post | Comments (676)BIOPaul Slansky, 09.10.2008Enough people are furious enough about what has happened to this country over the past eight years to elect Barack Obama in a landslide.

Fritz Hollings, 09.10.2008The nation has to sober up from this binge.
