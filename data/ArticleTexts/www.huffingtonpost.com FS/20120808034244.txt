{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressIf I had just 30 words to describe the state of the 2012 race, I would say, \"Obama holds a narrow but not insurmountable lead, and the lousy state of the economy offers Romney a better than average chance to win a close race.\" That would leave me with three words, which I would donate to a worthy charity. But even if I had several hundred words to describe the state of the race, I probably would not describe it as an imminent \"landslide.\" At least not in August of 2012. But Dick Morris, who primarily exists as a counteragent to Clinton-era nostalgia, is doing just that, because he\u0027s seen \"numbers\" that are more \"real\" than other, less \"real\" numbers, and these hypothetically add up to a Romney \"landslide\"Read Post | Comments (535)Howard Fineman, 08/07/12Editorial Director, AOL Huffington Post Media GroupI have news to report: Rush Limbaugh has finally had it with me. He has decided that I\u0027m rooting for America\u0027s decline and that I\u0027m a part of President Barack Obama\u0027s \"crop of Democrats.\" None of that is true, but it\u0027s worth recounting how Rush and I got to this point.Read Post | Comments (194)Brian Levin, J.D., 08/07/12Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State University\"I distinctly remember an email exchange with him shortly after 9/11 and he was very angry about Muslims and said something to the effect of America needing to go over to the Middle East and bomb \u0027em all.

Dubensky, 08/07/12CEO, Tanenbaum Center for Interreligious UnderstandingTragically, the Wisconsin devastation is not new or unique. Nor is it limited to one region of the world.
