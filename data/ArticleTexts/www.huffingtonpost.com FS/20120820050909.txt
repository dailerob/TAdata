{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The selection of Paul Ryan has changed the dynamics of the 2012 election in ways that, for the moment, seem to advantage President Obama and the Democrats. It has focused attention on a few key issues that should be Democrats\u0027 strength while diverting the spotlight from the slow economic recovery that is Obama\u0027s Achilles heel. Do most Americans really want to voucherize Medicare and privatize Social Security? Do we want drastic cuts in what\u0027s left of other social supports in order to give even larger tax cuts to millionaires?

Some parallels do exist. Both are men of strong convictions; both gained prominence at relatively young ages. More important than the similarities, however, are the differences.Read Post | Comments (58)Jen M.L., 08/18/12Blogger, People I Want to Punch in the ThroatOne of the things that attracts me to the Hubs is his confidence.
