{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week the nation entered terra incognita, as Indiana GOP voters handed Donald Trump a big victory, giving us -- with Ted Cruz and John Kasich dropping out -- the most unqualified, unstable, and dangerous nominee in U.S. history. The events immediately provided a test for Republicans, some of whom rose to the occasion and refused to endorse Trump. Then there was Rick Perry, who once called Trump a \"cancer.\" Now? He says he\u0027d consider being his running mate: \"I will be open to any way I can help. I\u0027m not going to say no.\" What stirring statesmanship. But this is not just a test for the GOP. It\u0027s also a test for the media, who, as David Roberts writes, is likely to give a very unusual campaign the usual media treatment: \"Trump\u0027s obvious unfitness for office -- today widely acknowledged across both parties and in the mainstream media -- will become a partisan observation.\" So, yes, as the media writes about how various Republicans are handling their character test, we need to remember we\u0027re facing one ourselves. The most important mistake the media could make now would be to treat this like a normal election, and Donald Trump like a normal candidate.Instead of providing support, we all too often leave the families who are struggling the most to fend for themselves. The odds are stacked against single mothers in this country. Yet so many give everything they have and go on to raise incredible children.Chief Operating Officer, FacebookIt\u0027s Mother\u0027s Day and this election has me thinking about mothers past, present, and future -- and what I will say to my future grandchildren if they ask me what happened to our democracy and to civility in 2016.Executive Director/CEO and Co-Founder of MomsRising.org*So, awaiting final toxicology, it has now been reported in the New York Times that Prince was toxic. I can relate. I was toxic too.Actress and children\u0027s book authorOn Tuesday, the musical Hamilton was nominated for a record 16 Tony awards. And three weeks ago, its creator and star, Lin-Manuel Miranda, won the Pulitzer Prize. And it\u0027s all, of course, richly deserved. But one angle of the saga of Hamilton, both on-stage and off, that has not been commented on is how it shows the value of time off. Alexander Hamilton wasn\u0027t just the subject of our country\u0027s first sex scandal. He was perhaps also our first fully documented case -- and the founding father -- of political burnout. And one of the biggest takeaways from the musical, for me, is this question: If the hard-driving Hamilton had given himself the time he needed to recharge, how much better -- and longer -- would he have been able to serve the adopted country he loved so much?I look at the long lines at polling stations, the broken machines, the disenfranchised voters and I wonder if having citizens vote is much of a priority in this country. We need to fix a system that we all know is broken. Tolerating it only exacerbates the problem and leads to more and more disillusionment that results in less and less voters.ActorI don\u0027t believe Selena Gomez or Andra Day would intentionally harm a single child, and yet their association with Coke will inevitably set millions of children on a path to poor health. We can\u0027t go on letting these stars use their cachet to hook our kids.Author, Producer, AdvocateAre we seriously asking why young people don\u0027t like the contrived politicians who are awash in donor money, privilege, and connections? That\u0027s obvious. What\u0027s not obvious is how older generations got so used to that pulp.Host, \u0027The Young Turks\u0027The media didn\u0027t \"get\" the Donald Trump or Senator Bernie Sanders phenomena because so many in the media are way out of touch with the American people. They look at politics through their own eyes, and the eyes of their media colleagues and not the eyes of the American people.Host, Fox News\u0027 \u0027On the Record With Greta Van Susteren\u0027Bernie\u0027s voters aren\u0027t just voting for Bernie. We are voting for the causes he supports and the solutions he aspires to. Bernie\u0027s path to the nomination is all but closed now, but the path to strengthening his message is still wide open.Democratic candidate for U.S. Representative of North Carolina\u0027s 2nd Congressional DistrictWildlife trafficking is a global problem, with implications that extend far beyond the populations of animals killed for their hair, hides, teeth, and horns. If we\u0027re going to be successful in stemming this epidemic, the United States must play a leading role in eliminating our own demand for illegal products.Secretary of the InteriorChairman, Tiffany \u0026 Co.Medicare wants to test new ways to pay for prescription drugs, which include many expensive treatments for multiple sclerosis and cancer. Officials think that by changing the incentive, they can improve patient care while saving both patients and taxpayers money.Chair of the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the University of PennsylvaniaDirector of Health Policy, Center for American ProgressWhat happens next will test the character for all of us - Republican, Democrat, and Independent. It will determine whether we move forward as one nation or splinter at the hands of one man\u0027s narcissism and divisiveness.Democratic Senator from MassachusettsIn today\u0027s climate of renewed economic anxiety, many are prompted to jettison this tradition of pragmatic liberal education. In search of short cuts to vocational success, they undermine students\u0027 ability to respond to changes in the economy by preparing them only for what is valued right now.President, Wesleyan UniversityAs parents and as policymakers, we cannot afford to let poverty determine the future of another generation of children. It is critical for policy to address this problem, and the Young Child Tax Credit is an important step in the right direction.U.S. Representative, Connecticut\u0027s Third DistrictPresident, Center for American ProgressWith several state attorneys general now investigating whether ExxonMobil misled its shareholders and the public about climate change risks, it was more than a little ironic when the company recently cried foul.Senior Writer, Union of Concerned ScientistsI am pleased that the first U.S. cruise ship to make a voyage to Cuba in almost 40 years arrived in Havana, Cuba, yesterday morning carrying 700 passengers, including Cuban Americans on board.Representative from the 13th Congressional District in New YorkBernie is the strongest candidate. Nevertheless, Hillary supporters refuse to accept this data. They are dead certain that Bernie would lose because America will never elect a socialist. They are sure (maybe a less so) that Hillary is the battle-tested warrior who will bring Trump to his knees.Author, \"Runaway Inequality: An Activist\u0027s Guide to Economic Justice\"As we celebrate mothers and grandmothers, foster mothers, and all those who step in to parent children in need, let\u0027s pledge to take responsibility not only for our own children and grandchildren but for all children, or at least for one child who may not be our own.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundBill O\u0027Reilly has every right to say that some kids are just bad apples, out of control, and should be carted off by constables. But educators have got be committed to proving him wrong.Veteran high school teacher and basketball coach; author, \u0027Students First and Other Lies\u0027This Mother\u0027s Day, make her day extra special by taking the time to tell her how much you care. For all that moms do day in and day out and how much they have done over the years, they deserve to know how much you appreciate them.Managing Editor of Blogs, Huffington Post CanadaAt the end of the day, it comes down to what \"values\" are the true metric of \"value investing\": shareholder return or public health. As a nation we have answered that question for tobacco, but we are clearly still debating it for sugar water.Executive Director, Center for Science in the Public InterestIf the Republican Party wishes to regain any of the respect it once had, you\u0027ll have to join the 21st century and recognize we are a diverse nation. The idea here is compromise. Conservatives and liberals must find a way to coexist.Author of American Woman: The Poll Dance, Media Director for We Are WomanAmidst the vitriol and lies being thrown around about trans people, I worry that a few basic principles have been lost. Here are five things to remember when talking, writing, or thinking about trans people.Attorney; founding board member, Lorena Borjas Community FundShow us how you wear your hijab to help us illustrate the vibrancy and diversity of Muslim women who don it. Tag your photo with #HijabToMe on Instagram, Facebook or Twitter, and we\u0027ll showcase it in The Huffington Post.Blog Editor, The Huffington PostToday in the United States, racial economic inequality persists because of the failure of will to invest in people of color, who continue to pay the price for a 21st century economy built off of the white supremacy of the 19th and 20th centuries. ItDirector of the Racial Wealth Divide Initiative and Host of the Race and Wealth podcast of CFEDThe racists and bigots of America have always been out there. There have always been hideous trolls on the Internet. But now they are emboldened in a big way by the bellicose Donald Trump. He\u0027s opened Pandora\u0027s box, and nobody can shut it.Writer, editor, self-styled political pundit, and former ABC News journalistIf Trump really loves women and is serious about getting their votes, let us hear his plan to fix a system that doesn\u0027t work for moms. The majority of mothers, like fathers, now work outside the home -- they need the money to support their families.Money Editor, Ms. magazine; national gender pay equity consultant, Director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsIn the heat of a Presidential election season and in light of a media that earns ratings by focusing on our divisions, we can forget that we are the United States of America. Although we may disagree among ourselves on many matters, some important concerns unite us. One of those unifying subjects is our Social Security system.Founding Co-director, Social Security WorksForged with the despicable dividend of stolen trade secrets, priced with monopoly collusion, then traded with fraudulent labeling to dodge U.S. duties, steel from China violates every principle of capitalism.International President, United SteelworkersOften we are acknowledged for mothering our living children and not for how we mother our children who have passed.Wife, mother to one on earth and three she carries in her heart, artist, student, writer, and founder of Luminous Light Studio.Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
