{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureWe don\u0027t yet know what is in the TPP, because it is still secret and will remain so until shortly before the fast-track process requires Congress to vote. The president says to trust him, telling us that it will be great and \"progressive\" and create lots of jobs and expand the economy. Great. But the history on our trade deals -- especially those passed using fast track -- has been very bad. NAFTA was sold as creating a lot of jobs and growing the economy, but NAFTA destroyed jobs and expanded the trade deficit. China\u0027s entry into the World Trade Organization was sold as creating a lot of jobs and growing the economy, but it turned out to be absolutely devastating for America\u0027s working people, middle class and entire manufacturing ecosystem, and the trade deficit with China is now enormous. As a result of these agreements, entire regions of the country look like wastelands. Seriously, go look at Detroit.How can cities rise to meet big new challenges -- and serve more and more people -- with resources that are always stretched thin? By finding smart ways to use a resource that is always growing: Data. And more and more cities are doing exactly that.Fmr. three-term mayor of New York City; Founder of Bloomberg Philanthropies and Bloomberg LPFive years after the BP blowout that killed 11 workers and dumped millions of barrels of oil in the Gulf of Mexico, the Obama administration has proposed exposing Atlantic and Arctic waters to the risk of a similar disaster.Former President, NRDCPoetry is not a frippery. It\u0027s a useful--even utilitarian--salve for what ails us. It is not the right salve for everyone, but it\u0027s right for some, and at times in its history, for very many. If it\u0027s right for you, you will know it. When you hear the right poem, you will feel its rightness.PoetLynch\u0027s confirmation delay is nothing more than bells, whistles and red meat for the right-wing. It\u0027s yet another message that Blacks, women and quote \"others\" are expendable, and the least priority at best; they are in fact targeted by this crowd.President, National Action NetworkHistory shows us that \"most qualified\" is no guarantee of a beneficial presidency, and electing the lesser qualified is no predictor of a bad administration. Let\u0027s take a look at a few examples.Political strategistConcealing potentially job-killing trade schemes from the American public thwarts democracy. Rushing unpopular legislation through Congress before American citizens have an opportunity to review it and tell their elected representatives how they feel about it obstructs democracy.International President, United SteelworkersRepealing the estate tax isn\u0027t just a boon for the 5,500 wealthiest Americans; it is a bust to federal taxpayers, who would be on the hook for its quarter-of-a-trillion-dollars cost. And it gets worse: Combined with other tax bills approved by House Republicans so far this year, our debt would grow by $584 billion to finance tax cuts for the wealthy.Sandy Levin is the Ranking Member of the House Ways and Means CommitteeFormer United States Navy Psychiatrist. United States Congressman, Washington 7th. Senior Member House Budget Committee, Committee on Ways \u0026 Means. Ranking Member Health Subcommittee, Ways \u0026 Means.\"You keep wearing trash like this and you\u0027ll end up a whore, just like the women who represent Playboy. Is that what you want? To be nothing but a slut?\"Writer. Sports lover. Whiskey drinker.As Americans celebrate 4/20, I\u0027m getting pelted with questions about the growing legalization movement. Why is legalization happening now? Until recently, I cited two factors. A few days ago, I added a third factor. It came after a visit to the Drug Enforcement Administration Museum outside Washington, D.C. Guggenheim Fellow; Author, \"Weed The People: The Future of Legal Marijuana in America\"Whereas military force is selectively necessary to destroy irredeemably ruthless and bloodthirsty organizations such as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), to neutralize violent extremism in the long-term, no amount of military muscle will suffice.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUIt\u0027s horrifying. It\u0027s inhumane. Yet there are men and women who are forced to make that choice every single day: whether to die at home, for certain; or to take to the sea and maybe die, or maybe live.JournalistI\u0027ve been thinking about the unsung birth heroes. I\u0027ve been thinking about the birth stories that don\u0027t necessarily receive all the thumbs up and high fives and Facebook shares. I\u0027m thinking about the cesarean section stories and the brave women who birth their children with such strength and beauty.Monet Moutrie is a writer and birth photographer based in Colorado. She co-founded cord, a birth and pregnancy blog.We are the richest country humanity has ever seen, and we are at our richest moment. Yet hardworking Americans keep coming home to \"a plate full of worry.\" This is largely because over the last few decades the wages of the bottom 80 percent of Americans have fallen or stagnated while the super-rich rake in all the profits. We can do better, and we must.U.S. Representative for Illinois\u0027s 9th congressional districtApparently, a set of practices and principles designed to ensure that human civilization has a future on this planet is akin to religious zealotry.Associate professor of government and Director of Environmental Studies, Hamilton CollegeWhen we do our \"gratitude inventory\" (aka, a way to get them to reflect and pray), they rattle off things as a matter of routine that many people would only dream of.Author of \u0027postChristian\u0027 (Jericho Books)The problem with using crime as a rationale for owning guns is that violent crime in the United States keeps going down. For that matter, so does the percentage of older, white men, who just happen to be the demographic that buys and owns most of the guns.Mike the Gun GuyBefore Star Wars, I was just a geeky, nerdy kid who enjoyed science fiction and fantasy but didn\u0027t really connect with too many others. After Star Wars, things changed. While I was still geeky and nerdy, I found friends who didn\u0027t notice, let alone care. We got each other and that was enough.Geeky FanboyEvery year, the Department of Defense burns, maims, and kills more than 8,500 goats and pigs teaching combat medicine and training trauma medics. It should go without saying these animals differ from humans on many essential anatomical levels. These differences lead to sub-par training.U.S. Senator from OregonU.S. Representative for Georgia\u0027s 4th DistrictAnyone who still thinks the Affordable Care Act was a \"government takeover of health care\" should consider this headline from the news pages of last Thursday\u0027s Investor\u0027s Business Daily -- a Wall Street publication whose editorial writers have rarely missed an opportunity to bash the healthcare-reform law.Author, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgFor the last four years, a town in southern Spain has been conducting a remarkable experiment in civic life. Jun (pronounced \"hoon\") has been using Twitter as its principal medium for citizen-government communication.Research scientist, Laboratory of Social Machines/MIT Media Lab; Author, Hamlet’s BlackBerryDirector, Laboratory for Social Machines/MIT Media Lab; Chief Media Scientist @TwitterDetroit was once famous for creating the largest, most spectacular versions of whatever its residents set their minds to. Few care to admit, however, that the city that was the arsenal of the twentieth century may also provide the blueprint for a more precarious era.Author, \u0027A Dream Foreclosed\u0027There\u0027s no silver bullet when it comes to helping all children achieve. Great public schools are our best shot. But until we have more leaders willing to look past ideology, listen to those closest to the classroom, and find common ground, we won\u0027t move forward.President, American Federation of TeachersAlthough we may think we\u0027re masking our insecurities or portraying ourselves in the most favorable light, our behavior on social media reveals more than we might think.Psychotherapist and author of 13 Things Mentally Strong People Don\u0027t DoNever lend money to a conservative. That\u0027s one conclusion to be drawn from recent attacks on Social Security by Bloomberg View columnists Megan McArdle and Ramesh Ponnuru. Apparently promises, even legally executed ones, don\u0027t mean much to their crowd.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourHighly educated women may be only a sliver of the American electorate, but they could hold the presidency in the palm of their hands. Instead of seeking to please \"the soccer moms\" or the \"Reagan democrats,\" candidates should try to win over the \"Smart Alices.\" Here\u0027s why.Associate Professor of Law, Stetson UniversityThe near universal failure of our universities to confront the compelling ethical and political issues intrinsic to our actions in the \"war on terror\" means that a generation of Americans will have their understanding shaped by the patriotic war porn of American Sniper and Zero Dark Thirty.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghPet ownership can be one of the great pleasures in life but a big financial surprise for those who don\u0027t research and plan for everyday and emergency costs. Before taking on the new addition, do your homework and create a budget.Vice President, Visa Inc.Our leaders are awakening to the fact that, even if scientists cannot attribute current drought entirely to human-caused climate change, this is what climate change looks like -- and we don\u0027t like that look.Chief scientist for Polar Bears International\"The media are finally waking up to the fact that their longtime portrayal of the typical marijuana user as a male slacker who resembles Cheech and/or Chong is old school, outdated, and embarrassingly limited.\"News, entertainment, lifestyle siteFive years on, though, what lessons have been learned?
