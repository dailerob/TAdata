{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"DAVOS, SWITZERLAND -- This week, while candidates \"squirmished\" in advance of Iowa, more than 2,000 global leaders gathered here for the World Economic Forum. The theme was The Fourth Industrial Revolution -- the coming era of automation and smart technology -- and what business can do to help meet the big challenges ahead of us. The dominant refrain was the need for business leaders to put purpose at the center of the definition of business itself. It\u0027s a shift, already underway, with the power to not only improve the world but also boost the bottom line. As Unilever CEO Paul Polman put it, \"investing in the common good, investing in the long term, is a better investment than just your short-term self-interest.\" What came through loud and clear this year was a growing realization that companies that chase short-term profits at the expense of social responsibility won\u0027t last very long. It\u0027s not just a better and more enlightened way forward; it\u0027s the only way forward.Going forward, business leaders, not just government leaders, will be judged by whether they succeed in directing the wave of exponential technology innovation to making the world a better place.Chairman and CEO of SalesforceOverturning Citizens United is an important and worthy cause, but it is not the panacea so many presidential candidates, pundits, and activists claim.Director, Represent.UsCommunications Director, Represent.UsEven as the global warming crisis makes it clear that coal, natural gas, and oil are yesterday\u0027s energy, the momentum of two centuries of fossil fuel development means new projects keep emerging in a zombie-like fashion. And it\u0027s not just pipelines, not by a long shot.Author of a dozen books, including \u0027The End of Nature\u0027 and \u0027Deep Economy\u0027Citizens United was bad history, bad logic, bad law. Nobody with any common sense thinks that huge corporate expenditures don\u0027t corrupt politics, but the Court left common sense behind that day.CEO of MAYDAY.US, Associate Law Professor at Fordham, Corruption ScholarIt\u0027s now possible to envision a world where our daughters and granddaughters have fewer rights than we did. With Hillary, we can make sure that bad dream never comes true.Actress, ActivistLook at how pharmaceutical companies actually spend their money. Contrary to what they claim, research does not dominate. Rather, more of the money goes toward funding marketing budgets and realizing profits.Chair of the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the University of PennsylvaniaI thought that attending college and medical school at Yale and Harvard, respectively, would be my golden ticket to America\u0027s meritocratic dream, that my prestigious diplomas would shield me from future experiences with racism and bigotry.Third-year medical resident at Massachusetts General HospitalTraveling from city to city in the U.S. and having the gut wrenching task of asking people to relive their most heartbreaking moments, I began to see through the smoke and mirrors the NRA has so masterfully created.Filmmaker, Brave New FoundationThis week, NOAA and NASA announced that 2015 was the hottest year on record globally, by a wide margin. That\u0027s the bad news. But here\u0027s the good news: We as a global community are starting to get serious about doing something about it.Mayor of Portland, OregonMayor of StockholmMayor of VancouverDespite the white noise campaign to discredit The Hunting Ground, there has been tremendous and unprecedented progress in new campus policies and regulations. The backlash claims that some of the campus rape date was exaggerated or simply false has been disproved over and over again.Leading Advocate for the Homeless, Victims of Domestic Violence and At-Risk YouthAdvocate, journalist and lecturerOn January 20, 2017, America will begin our next chapter. A new president will stand on the steps of the Capitol, raise one hand, and take the oath of office. From that moment on, he or she will decide whether we defend and build on the progress we\u0027ve made under President Obama -- or tear it all away.Democratic candidate for President; Former Secretary of State, U. S. Senator and First LadyI was shocked and dismayed at a meeting yesterday of the Environment and Public Works Committee (EPW) to consider S. 659, the so-called \"Bipartisan Sportsmen Act,\" which included an unrelated amendment that weakens our nation\u0027s drinking water protections.Ranking Member, Senate Environment and Public Works CommitteeAs we watch the Republican primary unfold, it\u0027s easy to forget for most of the candidates, there are two campaigns. There\u0027s only one official campaign, of course, but with one notable exception, every single one of the GOP candidates has a multi-million dollar super PAC supporting them.Candidate for U.S. Senate in WisconsinI believe that genius is made of three important ingredients: creative impulse, hard work and careful study. They are created, not born. Bowie was a genius. One more for old times sake, Mister Jones, with glitter on top?Co-founder and songwriter of The RunawaysThe financial crisis is behind us, right? Why would Wall Street shower Hillary Clinton with millions of dollars in speaking fees and tens of millions in campaign contributions? I think it is an insurance policy.Bestselling author of Survival Investing: How to Prosper Amid Thieving Banks and Corrupt Governments and professor of finance at S P Jain School of Global ManagementThe frontier to conquer this time is not space but the depths of our own genomes. There\u0027s hope that the ability to correct faulty genes and the mutations they cause will lead to new cures for cancer. Informatics infrastructure, including using artificial intelligence that enables smart data mining, is also crucial.Author, Biocode: The New Age of GenomicsThe civic minds of the people are sidelined by the monetized minds of a corrupted commercial media, political consultants, pundits and the purveyors of an ever-more dictatorial corporate state.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorI began to get \"the gun thing,\" as I\u0027d dismissively termed it. A few who wrote to me pointed out that when you live in a rural community and calling law enforcement does not necessarily result in a prompt response, owning a gun for personal safety seems prudent.Mother, journalist and blogger at caramcduna.comBilious as it is, Donald Trump\u0027s pledge to \"make America great again\" touches something deeper than just resentment or nostalgia -- a desire for national renewal which, at its best, could inspire a more transcendent politics, transforming widespread angst about our future into a shared and positive mission. All too often Democrats fail to transcend.Novelist and contributing opinion writerIf \"affluenza\" is indeed what caused Ethan Couch to get behind the wheel with a blood alcohol count three times the legal limit for adults, resulting in the deaths of four people, he deserves to face consequences. But he also deserves to get some help.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarSix years ago this week, the U.S. Supreme Court created a Wild West of campaign finance regulations. With their decision in Citizens United, five justices set the stage for a flood of secret special interest money trying to buy elections nationwide.The only way you can justify a position in which a woman does not make her own reproductive decisions is if you believe she is not ethically and morally capable, as a function of her gender, and, in the U.S., race. It means you do not trust her to be a fully adult, fully human, being.Feminist, writer, and satirist (not always in that order)This week the Human Rights Campaign, the largest LGBT group, endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. It was a bit of a shocker not because HRC endorsed a Democrat but that it occurred before even one vote has been cast in the Democratic primaries.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostHonoring Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. should sharply remind us that the Civil Rights Movement should never just be chapters in history books. Communities and children across the country need to believe they can stay on the march towards justice.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundOne of the worst examples of under-covered hate is the escalation of attacks and the persecution of Christians, particularly outside of the United States, where thousands are routinely murdered and imprisoned, while their magnificent sacred churches are destroyed.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityMany low-income women and girls share a similar struggle -- especially those who are experiencing homelessness. Inability to afford tampons or pads or to access hygiene facilities, can severely compromise women\u0027s health, productivity and dignity.Feminist. Activist. Writer.PhotographerIn the stronger, older tradition of campaigns based on ideas and programs rather than personalities, candidates run to build power, and use idealistic language to explain why that power matters. Then, if they get to govern, they use it.Professor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027If he were here today, the martyred Dr. King would surely be shaking his head that America still has a problem with peaceful dissenters of conscience.Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyWe should acknowledge that Bowie slept with an underage woman to acknowledge that he is human. Yes, his talent was exceptional. No, he was not a monster. But we should never glorify celebrities to the point that we refuse to acknowledge that they\u0027re capable of ugly acts.Blogs Editor, Huffington PostClinton argues that she favors fundamental campaign finance reform, but she can\u0027t \"unilaterally disarm.\" Deep pocket Republicans are amassing huge war chests to assault her. She has to be armed with big money to defend herself. But in doing so, Clinton \"unilaterally disarmed\" her own credibility.President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
