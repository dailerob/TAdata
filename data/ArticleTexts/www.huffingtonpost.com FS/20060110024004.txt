{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"From money.cnn.comAP/John McConnicoNewly released court documents add fuel to the speculation that Tim Russert didn\u0027t want to testify about his conversations with Scooter Libby because he thought it would land Scooter in hot water. Isn\u0027t that sweet? So even after Scooter released Russert from any promise of confidentiality, Mr. Meet the Press had his lawyers petition a judge to let their client take a pass on talking with Pat Fitzgerald -- arguing that doing so would, in the words of the Washington Post, \"harm Russert\u0027s relationships with other sources.\" Sources?
