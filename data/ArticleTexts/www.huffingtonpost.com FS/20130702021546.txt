{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThe Fed has to unwind at some point. We can\u0027t keep wasting billions on inefficient health care, and there\u0027s no pure market solution (see Arrow, half-a-century ago). Recessions must be offset by fiscal and monetary policy or millions of workers will be needlessly exposed to potentially severe losses. Though dysfunctional government and the willful economic ignorance of too many policy makers is eroding it, I still have faith in the ability of our economic system to deal with these challenges, including any uncertainty such dealings must engender. In presenting this faith to my more conservative colleagues, I often find that they\u0027ve got considerably less faith in the system than I do. Which leads me to wonder, who\u0027s the real capitalist here?Comments (162)Kirk DouglasActorI\u0027ve lived a long time. Almost 97 years. I\u0027ve seen a lot of fear-mongering, bigotry and discrimination. But now I\u0027m also seeing a modern generation of children who view the world very differently than their parents and grandparents.Comments (179)Laura Arrillaga-AndreessenFounder of Stanford Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society; Founder of Silicon Valley Social Venture Fund (SV2); Author, NYT Bestseller \u0027Giving 2.0: Transform Your Giving and Our World\u0027My father taught me many important giving lessons, but two stand out. First, always give as much as you possibly can. And second, give equally from among your resources -- your time, your mind and your capital. These are principles I live by.Comments (20)Vivian NorrisPh.D. focusing on Globalization and Media StudiesDo not make him dinner, do not go fetch him a cold beer from the fridge, do not iron that shirt, hell, do not change that diaper... do not make his life a little nicer this summer if he does not \"get it\" and learn to respect women!Comments (1,166)Jedediah PurdyProfessor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027Reading Walden through Anthropocene eyes, insight and appreciation of nature seem to emerge from, even require, rupture and profanation. Maybe these are unavoidable parts of an appreciative relation to the world. Maybe the imperfect has always been our only paradise.Comments (181)Cecile RichardsPresident of Planned Parenthood Federation of America and Planned Parenthood Action FundThe Texas Legislature is back at the Capitol today, trying to pass a bill that would wipe out access to safe and legal abortion for millions of women in the state. If this all sounds familiar, it\u0027s because we\u0027ve seen this bill before.Comments (111)Kristin Kirkpatrick, M.S., R.D., L.D.Manager of Wellness Nutrition Services at Cleveland Clinic Wellness InstituteFor those that have not yet embraced a tea-drinking habit, it\u0027s never too late to start brewing a batch! Explore the various types, flavors, and brands to find your tea-mate.Comments (70)Greta Van SusterenHost, Fox News\u0027 \u0027On the Record With Greta Van Susteren\u0027I don\u0027t know about you, but I would love to have seen just one U.S. Senator stay in Washington -- instead of going on vacation -- just to send the message that American students come first instead of their vacation! Instead each Senator could not get to the airport fast enough on Friday to start their vacations.Comments (182)Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOIf you still have room on your summer reading list, here are three books that will familiarize you with concepts and tools that I think you might find very useful in both your personal and professional lives. Together they provide theoretical and practical approaches to deal with today\u0027s fluid and complex world.Comments (13)Michael D\u0027AntonioAuthor, \u0027Mortal Sins, Sex, Crime, and the Era of Catholic Scandal\u0027Documents released today in Milwaukee show that Catholic church leaders, including then archbishop Timothy Dolan, deliberately transferred $59 million to a trust in order to protect it from the claims of people who had been sexually abused by local priests.Comments (15)Gordon BrownFormer Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationThe fight for girls\u0027 education is the civil rights struggle of our generation. It will need a determined and vocal global campaign to make it a priority in countries where girls\u0027 needs have been neglected.CommentsRobert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Today, the obstructionists and vote suppressors are all Republicans. Ultimately, this will not be lost on a changing electorate. The forces of anti-democracy have won this round, but if the progressive movement gets itself organized, this victory for Republicans will be Pyrrhic.Comments (1,032)Blake MorganRecording artist, producer, and label owner.Mr. Westergren says his company exists to help artists. He and Pandora have the opportunity to be the champions they say they want to be. It\u0027s time we called on the better angels of their nature to do what\u0027s right. It can\u0027t be just any help, it has to be the right kind.CommentsLaila AlawaMuslim-American activist, blogger and outspoken feministSo why should the production of such hard-hitting, necessary hell-sending ammunition ever be protested? Oh, wait. Perhaps it\u0027s because the production of the pork-laced bullets are completely erroneous in intention and purpose.Comments (37)Linda RobertsonLeader, Local HIV/AIDS Outreach Team, Overlake Christian Church, Redmond, Was.; CareTeam member and volunteer, RoseHedge MultiFaith Works, Seattle, Wash.We told our son that he had to choose between Jesus and his sexuality. Choosing God, practically, meant living a lifetime condemned to being alone. So, just before his 18th birthday, Ryan, depressed, suicidal and disillusioned, made a new choice.Comments (1,039)Sen. Barbara Boxer and Sen. Dick DurbinAs Members of the United States Senate who are committed to the economic advancement of women around the globe, we are profoundly troubled by recent proposals that would fundamentally alter the future of Bangladesh\u0027s Nobel Prize-winning Grameen Bank.CommentsDoug BandowSenior Fellow, the Cato InstituteCongress is debating the so-called Federal Agricultural Reform and Risk Management Act. More commonly known as the Farm Bill, it is a looting expedition, roughly 80 percent general welfare (food stamps, officially called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) and 20 percent farm welfare (agricultural price supports).CommentsRaymond J. LearsyAuthor, \u0027Oil and Finance: The Epic Corruption Continues\u0027If the nation is benefiting so handsomely from its newly developed riches in natural gas, why have similar developments in the spectrum of oil production not resulted in a comparable impact?Comments (77)Nathan NewmanNYU Information Law Institute FellowThe potential abuses due to corporate access to that data are as bad as the NSA control -- and the documented harm to the public has been worse.CommentsRichard StacySocial media strategistWhile social media tends towards the small, there is one thing that has become big as a result, and this is data. We now all live within a thousand datasets, each one of which is like a compass bearing on our identity. This fact is overturning all our concepts of privacy, data protection and the significance of information.CommentsP.G. SittenfeldCincinnati City CouncilmanAnd the hopes for a Republican revival in 2016 rest upon... ? The answer to that question, according to a featured article that Politico ran at the end of last week, just might be Ohio Governor John Kasich.Comments (15)Patrick MurphyMSNBC contributor, CAP Senior Fellow, Formerly 82d Airborne in Iraq \u0026 U.S. CongressmanAs we bask in these historic decisions, it\u0027s worth acknowledging some of the unsung patriots who carried the torch for the freedom to marry. No list is exhaustive, but each of these great Americans helped pave the way for marriage equality to become law.CommentsPeter Van BurenAuthor, \u0027We Meant Well\u0027 and the upcoming \u0027Ghosts of Tom Joad, A Story of the #99Percent\u0027As a State Department whistleblower, I think a lot about Edward Snowden. I can\u0027t help myself. Here are five things that I imagine were on his mind (they would have been on mine) as that plane took off.Comments (36)Michael WinshipSenior writer, Moyers \u0026 Company; Senior writing fellow, Demos; President, Writers Guild, EastThe president ordered the Justice Department\u0027s beleaguered Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to deliver an annual report on lost and stolen firearms in the United States. It makes for fascinating, disturbing readingComments (143)Napoleon PerdisMakeup artistA summer sojourn is all about escaping from your daily routine; you dress in a different way, dine at different times in different locations, you lighten up on the demands of your day. So why then, should you stick to your same signature makeup look?CommentsMarissa HigginsWriter4. \"Who\u0027s the guy in your relationship?\"Ouch. Some aspects of the patriarchy simply don\u0027t apply in same-sex relationships, and someone having to be \"the guy\" in a lesbian relationship is one of them.CommentsNathan J. WinogradDirector, No Kill Advocacy CenterI became a No Kill advocate because to me, death is the ultimate cruelty; a frightening emptiness that leaves nothing but pain for those of us left behind.Comments (34)Blake KernenA 7th grader from Morristown-Beard School, New JerseyI\u0027ve always known the Fourth of July is a day to celebrate America\u0027s birthday, its independence from British rule and the signing of the Declaration of Independence. But as a teenager, I\u0027ve also come to realize that as Americans, we are celebrating a lot of other freedoms also.CommentsMichael P. McDonaldAssociate Professor, George Mason UniversityA popular claim among some is that Republicans were innocent in partisan gerrymandering in the most recent congressional redistricting. When one draws congressional districts, Democrats are at a disadvantage because of where they live.CommentsBeth HopkinsWriter, Advocate, HumoristMy devotion to my Faith and its teachings about marriage does not mean I have the right to make anyone else\u0027s faith or marriage illegal. And it doesn\u0027t mean I should be unkind, rude, or unloving toward anyone, whether my theology agrees with their lifestyle or not.Comments (273)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarIf a workplace is becoming more emotion-friendly, women certainly have at least something to do with it. It\u0027s with the greatest caution that I commit to print the idea that women are more emotional than men. Back away from that Tweet. Science is on my side.Comments (131)Mike Spradley, 2013. 1.07Chris Weigant, 2013. 1.07Laverne Cox, 2013. 1.07Richard Koch, 2013. 1.07Doug Schulkind, 2013. 1.07Charles Cole III, 2013. 1.07Mia Norton, 2013. 1.07Mitch Kellaway, 2013. 1.07Doug Bandow, 2013. 1.07Floyd Elliot, 2013. 1.07Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"ON THE BRINK",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
