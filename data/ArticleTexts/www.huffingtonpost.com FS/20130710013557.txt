{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureFrom infant care and early education to Social Security and Medicare, the dominant economic ideology is demanding more lifelong sacrifices from the vulnerable to appease the gods of wealth. Middle-class wages are stagnant. Uemployment is stalled at record levels. College education is leading to debt servitude and job insecurity. Millions of unemployed Americans have essentially been abandoned by their government. Poverty is soaring. Bankers break the law with impunity, are bailed out, and go on breaking the law, richer than they were before. And yet, bizarrely, the only Americans who seem to be seething with anger are the beneficiaries of this economic injustice -- the wealthiest and most privileged among us. But those who are suffering seem strangely passive. As long as they stay that way, there will be no movement to repair these injustices. And the more these injustices are allowed to persist, the harder it will be to end them.Comments (1,336)Russell SimmonsFounder, GlobalGrind.comIf George Zimmerman had rights, so did Trayvon Martin. And that is why Mr. Zimmerman was properly arrested and charged with murder in the second degree. He will soon be judged by a jury of his peers, and that is the best we can do.Comments (1,934)Kristen LauriaVice President of Marketing, IBM Mobile Enterprise for IBM\u0027s Software GroupWhile mobile computing is becoming the darling of marketers, its explosive growth rate is rather daunting, with more customers shopping via mobile devices every day. Forrester Research anticipates mobile commerce will exceed $31 billion by 2016. And by 2020 there will be 10 billion-plus devices in the pockets and palms of consumers.CommentsGalip DalayPolitical researcher, SETA Foundation in TurkeyThe Islamist identity of Morsy and his party seems to be the major reason for the reticence of the international community and media in defining this coup a coup.Comments (545)Robert ScheerEditor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027Embarrassingly, our law professor president refuses to label the arrest of Egypt\u0027s freely elected president by the military a coup because that would trigger an end to the $1.5 billion in U.S. aid as a matter of law.Comments (269)Elissa StraussBlogger and essayistBasically every person a pregnant women meets has some idea or tip about what you should and shouldn\u0027t do with your baby. When I was pregnant, I got advice from cab-drivers, relatives and the tower of books I read, in horror, late into the night the month before I gave birth.Comments (87)Jerome KarabelProfessor of Sociology, University of California at BerkeleyThe most powerful impact of the Supreme Court\u0027s decision on Voting Rights may not be on the size of the minority vote. Instead, its most profound -- and insidious -- effect may reside in the weight it lends to an emergent narrative that racism is no longer a serious problem and that the real threat to equal justice now is \"reverse discrimination\" against whites.Comments (21)Harvey WeinsteinFilm ProducerIf we run ads with The Butler, the MPAA is imposing $25,000 a day in penalties. We have to pull 5,000 trailers from the theaters, we have to pull our website down, all of which we complied with. What the hell do they need the title for?Comments (43)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027It is widely recognized that economists are not very good at economics. That is why we are looking at a decade of economic stagnation with tens of millions of people being unemployed or underemployed in Europe and the United States.Comments (213)Anthonia AkitundeAssociate Editor Huff/Post50Meeting your significant others\u0027 folks is a situation that can be so fraught with tension, it\u0027s no wonder Hollywood has plumbed the moment for all its worth (\"Meet the Parents,\" \"Guess Who\u0027s Coming To Dinner?\" -- we could go on and on).Comments (26)Jordan SchultzThe Huffington Post\u0027s sports columnist, The Schultz ReportUltimately, Anthony can choose to opt out of his mega-contract next summer and, in turn, allow the Knicks to start the entire process of building a legitimate contender over again.CommentsImam Khalid LatifExecutive Director and Chaplain, Islamic Center at New York UniversityWhile I break my fast with with friends and family, the men and women of Guantanamo will have their fast purposely broken far away from any family -- some being detained now for almost a decade.Comments (24)Annice BrownBlogger, www.oops50.comWhen I was in my 20s, success meant money and power because that\u0027s how men defined it, and I modeled my success after theirs.Comments (12)Mark WeisbrotCo-director, Center for Economic and Policy Research, Washington, D.C.Snowden can reach many millions more with the truth. He needs to speak not only to save himself but future whistle-blowers whom the Obama administration wants to silence by punishing him.Comments (79)Victor StengerPhysicist, Ph.D., bestselling author, author of \u0027God and the Atom\u0027Rather than protest the religious displays, which has not met with much success anyway, the new strategy is, \"If you can\u0027t beat them, join them.\" It seems to be working. If public spaces are to be open forums and all voices are heard, then how can anyone complain?Comments (34)William K. BlackAssoc. Professor, Univ. of Missouri, Kansas City; Sr. regulator during S\u0026L debacleThose two sentences tell us more about financial crisis\u0027 cause, and how easy it was to prevent, than all the books published about the crisis -- combined. Here are ten key implications.Comments (106)John TirmanExecutive Director, MIT Center for International StudiesThe United States is partially governed by a deep state: undemocratic, secret, aligned with intelligence agencies, spying on friend and foe, lawless in almost every respect. If this doesn\u0027t constitute a coup d\u0027etat, it\u0027s hard to imagine what would.CommentsJanet ColmPresident \u0026 CEO, Planned Parenthood of Central North Carolina and Planned Parenthood Action Fund of Central North CarolinaAll these issues are connected -- education, health care, prenatal care, unemployment benefits, support for domestic violence services, early education, voting rights -- and access to birth control, accurate sex education, and abortion. This is how we make our state better.Comments (19)Alan KrinskySenior Healthcare AnalystWhat we ought to do is scrap this system and replace it with one consisting of four major parties. Even this will not cover all Americans, but it will certainly encompass more of us and within a more rational framework. For what might these four major parties stand?Comments (13)Katherine FrankeIsidor and Seville Sulzbacher Professor, Director of the Center for Gender and Sexuality Law, Columbia Law SchoolIt\u0027s not obvious that family law is equipped to adjudicate fair separations of same-sex couples when it encounters the ways we\u0027ve busted out of gendered notions of relationship. Modern divorce law may end up gendering us into \"wives\" and \"husbands\" because that\u0027s all it is equipped to recognize.CommentsJoanna MontgomeryWife, mother, writer, survivorThe Westboro Baptist Church has made it embarrassing to be homophobic. And for that I thank them.CommentsDina PowellGlobal Head of Corporate Engagement, Goldman SachsIf the new Egypt, the most populous Arab nation in the world, empowers its women fully, it can also become the strongest, most prosperous and hopefully most peaceful nation in the region.Comments (13)Wendell PotterAuthor, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgThe Obama administration\u0027s decision to postpone the requirement that large employers offer health insurance to their workers has been characterized by pundits on the left as a capitulation to big business and on the right as the latest evidence that Obamacare isn\u0027t working. Actually, it\u0027s neither.Comments (24)Stephanie R. CaudleManaging Editor, She\u0027s My SuperwomanThere are numerous things I never thought I would have to tell people not to do but in many cases common sense is not so common. Here are a few tips you should consider NOT doing when attending your next wedding.Comments (265)Matthew HarwoodJournalist/WriterThe numbers couldn\u0027t be clearer: right-wing extremists have committed far more acts of political violence since 1990 than American Muslims.Comments (35)Fred KargerPresident, Rights Equal RightsThe party of Lincoln should once again be the party of equality. More Republicans should join President Obama and so many other Democrats in the fight for the freedom to marry for all LGBT Americans. Ronald Reagan would undoubtedly be championing that fight if he were alive today.CommentsMariane PearlJournalist, author and activistThe truth is that courage as a common thread usually makes for a good narrative. Courage is what it takes to live your best life as a woman.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorI was taken aback when some of the European austerity supporters used the American economy\u0027s experience with sequestration so far to defend their case: it doesn\u0027t seem to be hurting your economy, so keep your Keynesianism to yourself.Comments (14)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkUntil we, the people of this nation, unite as one and continue fighting for expanded equality for all of God\u0027s children so that they may in fact be free from persecution, discrimination and the shackles of inequality, a post-racial America will only be a comfort on the lips of those seeking to advance themselves.Comments (314)Howard FinemanEditorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupEliot Spitzer, the previously disgraced former governor of New York, told me today that he is testing what may be new dynamics of personal transgression and forgiveness in politics.Comments (782)Jeff CohenAuthor and media criticWith Obama in power, a number of MSNBC talking heads have reacted to the Snowden disclosures like Fox News hosts did when they were in hysterical damage control mode for Bush -- complete with ridiculously fact-free claims and national chauvinism that we\u0027ve long come to expect from the \"fair \u0026 balanced\" channel.Comments (889)Sudy BharadwajCo-Founder and CEO, Jackalope JobsWhat can you do as a veteran if you can\u0027t land a job?
