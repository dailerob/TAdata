{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Fellow, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesIn politics, \"nobody\" is a tough opponent. Like my old boss the VP used to say, \"don\u0027t compare me to the Almighty, compare me to the alternative.\" This is especially germane on the economy. Obama\u0027s potential opponents will inevitably be singing from an economic policy songbook that\u0027s no different from the one that got us into this mess. More tax cuts, less regulation. These ideas tickle the base, no doubt. But it\u0027s hard to imagine this policy set resonating with the independents who may ultimately decide the next election. This is ultimately good news for the president.Read Post | CommentsAlec Baldwin, 06.04.2011ActorPerhaps Twitter is best for promotional purposes. I don\u0027t really know just yet. But apropos of my Twitter-izing about Mitt Romney and the GOP field of candidates, let me add this addendum.Read Post | CommentsSec. Kathleen Sebelius, 06.05.2011Secretary of Health and Human ServicesEvery year, nearly 56,000 Americans still get infected with HIV, and 16,000 die of AIDS.

Stone, 06.05.2011Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law at the University of ChicagoJudges purporting to engage in originalist analysis often project onto the Framers their own personal and political preferences. The result is an unprincipled and often patently disingenuous jurisprudence.Read Post | CommentsScott Mendelson, 06.05.2011Film CriticX-Men was used to being near the top of the box office charts, but now has to rebuild from the ground up, emphasizing quality and character over big-budget spectacle.Read Post | CommentsRobert Reich, 06.05.2011Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Aftershock\u0027The unemployed are politically invisible. They don\u0027t make major campaign donations. They don\u0027t lobby Congress. There\u0027s no National Association of Unemployed People. This is why neither party seems to care that we\u0027re heading back towards a double-dip recession.Read Post | CommentsDoug Bandow, 06.04.2011Senior Fellow at the Cato InstituteHow noble an enterprise, creating \"second chance brigades\" for those who found themselves too busy promoting wars to serve in them when they were young. Congress might want to name the program after a figure who inspires us all: the Cheney brigades.Read Post | CommentsWilliam Hartung, 06.04.2011Director, Arms and Security Project, Center for International PolicyThe combined costs of the wars this year amount to nearly $170 billion. While $19 billion less than \u002708, it\u0027s a modest drop considering Iraq spending decreased almost $100 billion since then too. In other words, 4 of every 5 dollars saved from Iraq were reinvested in Afghanistan.Read Post | CommentsJames Zogby, 06.04.2011President, the Arab American Institute; Author, \"Arab Voices\"While one could quibble with aspects of Obama\u0027s state department speech and his remarks before AIPAC, I was struck by some things he said that didn\u0027t register in the U.S. press or in the Arab World\u0027s media.Read Post | CommentsRocky Kistner, 06.04.2011Media associate, NRDCRep.
