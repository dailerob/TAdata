{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOA stunning new study found that while the unemployment rate among those making over $150,000 was only 3 percent, the rate for those in the bottom 10 percent of income was a staggering 31 percent. Does anyone believe that we would be facing the same lack of urgency about the jobs crisis in Washington if it were the unemployment rate among the top 10 percent that was 31 percent? If one-third of television news producers, pundits, bankers, and lobbyists were unemployed, would the measures being proposed by the White House and Congress still be as pathetic as the ones we\u0027re seeing now? Of course not -- the sense of national emergency would be so great you\u0027d practically be hearing air raid sirens howling. Instead we get baby steps, bipartisanship, and band-aids.Read Post | Comments (633)BIOSteve Clemons, 02.18.2010Publisher of \"The Washington Note\"The change, which goes into effect on September 1, 2010, sounds a little like \"Mission Accomplished.\" But this time, maybe a good chunk of soldiers really will be pulled back home.Read Post | CommentsBIOGlenn W.
