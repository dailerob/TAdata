{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOI hate to be the one to break up a love affair, especially with Valentine\u0027s Day just around the corner, but I can no longer stand idly by and watch the media and independent voters continue to throw themselves at the feet of John McCain. The McCain they fell in love with in 2000 -- the straight-shooting maverick -- is no more. He\u0027s been replaced by a born-again Bushite willing to say or do anything to win the affection of his newfound object of desire, the radical right. And we\u0027ve got the money shot of his betrayal on tape: McCain singing the praises of Karl Rove, calling him \"one of the smartest political minds in America,\" and saying, \"I\u0027d be glad to get his advice.\" Face it, this ain\u0027t the same man you married.Read Post | CommentsBIONora Ephron, 02.11.2008This is the attention deficit disorder election. Everything is happening at warp speed. Everyone is bouncing around on the net and changing the channel.

But in the event that, by a very narrow margin, the voters get it right, who will protect us from the party?Read Post | CommentsBIOKen Levine, 02.11.2008The incessant honking. It was like driving in Mexico City... Hanging out on the picket line with my good buddy Elvis Costello. It was one of the greatest minutes of my life.Read Post | CommentsBIOJames Moore, 02.11.2008Oh irony of ironies. March 4th, a date that wasn\u0027t supposed to mean much in the Democratic primary process, may give Texas further undue influence over this nation\u0027s democracy.Read Post | Comments (94)BIOHilary Rosen, 02.11.2008I have talked to many Democratic SuperDelegates in the last few days and the one thing they all have in common -- they don\u0027t want to use their supervote.Read Post | Comments (54)Ari Emanuel, 02.10.2008After the democracy-snubbing arrogance of the Bush years, the last thing Democrats should be doing is wavering on our democratic principles.Read Post | Comments (527)BIODonnie Fowler, 02.10.2008The superdelegates are, in fact, \"super\" because of their commitment to the Democratic Party and its ideals, not because they have extra votes or because one presidential campaign controls them.Read Post | Comments (257)BIODavid Bromwich, 02.11.2008President Bush recently sought to convey, through the curious medium of a Fox News interview, his assurance to the nations of the Middle East that America harbors no imperial design.Read Post | Comments (34)BIOJason Linkins, 02.11.2008A strong case can be made that Clinton\u0027s been roughly treated by the press. The case that cannot be made is that the Obama campaign is culpable for this treatment.Read Post | Comments (994)BIOArianna Huffington, 02.10.2008The announcement that Maggie Williams just became Hillary Clinton\u0027s new campaign manager sent me back to a column I wrote about her over ten years ago.Read Post | Comments (338)BIOLarry Miller, 02.11.2008I can hear the double-takes all over America. \"What? Not go to the Playboy Mansion? Are you crazy? Who doesn\u0027t want to go to the Playboy Mansion? Even Naomi Wolf and Larry Craig would go to the Playboy Mansion.Read Post | CommentsBIONancy Cohen, 02.11.2008Why the disjuncture between the image and the reality? The answer lies in the confusion of meaning generated by the three adjectives used to describe McCain: maverick, independent, and moderate.Read Post | CommentsMichael Shaw, 02.11.2008Peggy Drexler, 02.11.2008Sheila Weller, 02.10.2008Laura Tyson, 02.11.2008Marty Kaplan, 02.10.2008Matthew Dowd, 02.11.2008Cenk Uygur, 02.11.2008Bill Press, 02.09.2008Tom Hayden, 02.11.2008Peter Dreier, 02.10.2008Steve Clemons, 02.11.2008Nathaniel Bach, 02.11.2008Jennifer Nix, 02.10.2008Sean Carman, 02.11.2008Marcia G.
