{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"With the White House pushing its Race to the Top initiative, and Waiting for \"Superman\" sparking a national conversation about both the problems plaguing America\u0027s schools and the innovative solutions being implemented all across the country, America is having an Education Moment. As such, we\u0027ve launched a new section devoted to the issue. HuffPost Education will be home to a spirited conversation about what\u0027s gone wrong with America\u0027s schools, and what needs to be done to fix them. The section will also celebrate the many teachers who, despite a broken system, are doing heroic work in the classroom. Our nation\u0027s education crisis demands \"the fierce urgency of now.\" That urgency will inform and animate HuffPost Education. Check it out. And let us know what you think -- especially you teachers, parents, and students. We want to hear from you.Read Post | CommentsJoseph A.

The message they are receiving from adults is that today in 2010 it may not be okay to call someone the N-word on the playground, but it is okay to call someone the F-word.Read Post | CommentsChez Pazienza, 10.05.2010Editor of Deus Ex Malcontent, AuthorContrary to the screaming headlines, Sanchez didn\u0027t in fact shout that the Jews control the media. And in any case, the speed and ease with which he was dumped may prove that he was right: Maybe he never really was accepted by the pretentious media establishment.Read Post | CommentsJoe Zee, 10.05.2010Creative director, ELLEThis recent headline from a fashion trade scared the crap out of me: The Nineties are Back!
