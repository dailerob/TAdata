{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonI\u0027m delighted to announce Financial Education, a new HuffPost section in partnership with Bank of America\u0027s Better Money Habits initiative. Financial Education will be a hub of stories, advice and tools to help you make informed money management decisions, from planning a budget and reducing debt to improving your credit score and refinancing a mortgage. Financial Education is rooted in the belief that by empowering ourselves to take control of our own financial lives, we can reduce the stress that so often accompanies financial decisions and at the same time improve the parts of our lives that are about so much more than money: our health, our families, our careers, our homes.CommentsMiruna MacriArtistAnyone who has lost a passport knows how much of a nightmare it is to get a replacement. So what would you do if you found someone\u0027s passport? You do your best to track down that person to give it back, right? At least that\u0027s what I hoped for when I came up with my Passfolio idea.CommentsDean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027If reporters ever run out of people to feature who lost their insurance plan, they may want to spend a minute or two looking at what has happened to the cost of health care over the last five years.Comments (230)Laura GottesdienerAuthor, \u0027A Dream Foreclosed\u0027You can hardly turn on the television or open a newspaper without hearing about the nation\u0027s impressive, much celebrated housing recovery. Home prices are rising! The crisis is over! Yet beneath the fanfare, a whole new get-rich-quick scheme is brewing.Comments (89)Valerie JarrettSenior Advisor to the President and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsNo corporate entity should be in position to limit women\u0027s legal access to care, or to seize a controlling interest over the health care choices of women.Comments (21)Muhammad AliBoxing LegendFew men in the history of mankind have had more impact on a nation and inspired the world.Comments (72)Davey DOakland resident, social justice avocate, adjunct professor, host of \u0027Hard Knock Radio\u0027 94.1 FMMany in the media are making it appear as if this is some sort of game spreading like wild fire from coast to coast. It\u0027s simply not true. The fact that they are taking any crime and calling it as part of Knockout Game trend is akin to when the police label every crime in certain communities \"gang related.\"Comments (154)Morgan RotondiAn American in DresdenI am now a 25-year-old woman from middle class \"privilege\" facing a crushing $60,000 of debt, with a 20-year loan repayment plan. I am still treading water each month, balancing multiple jobs. Is this how I am being \"compensated\" for my accomplishments, Mr. Reinharz?Comments (40)Sam ResslerLos Angeles-based actress and writerHow do we demand respect if this is how we behave on an app? We don\u0027t deserve it.Comments (228)April McCormickFreelance Writer, Author and Blogger.\"First Time Mom \u0026 Dad\"Now, I am well aware that in a way I will always be a rookie with my firstborn, since every day, stage and milestone is new for both of us; however, I feel it is my duty to share the top 10 mistakes I, and fellow rookie moms, made during our first year in the mama big league.Comments (36)Jordan K. TurgeonLifestyle Blog Editor, The Huffington PostWhen it comes to holidays, Thanksgiving has the best menu, in my very humble and completely unscientific opinion. We\u0027re talking all of my favorites: mashed potatoes, apple pie, dinner rolls, turkey gravy, stuffing... Notice a trend here? Gluten. Wheat. Dairy. Gluten and wheat and dairy in (almost) everything.CommentsDavid J. EicherEditor-in-Chief, Astronomy magazineAs astronomers who have been watching the comet know, however, the past few days -- and the next few days -- will not be the best ones to try to catch the comet.CommentsAn NYC MomWe were walking on a New York City sidewalk when my son, who was holding my hand, stumbled. He didn\u0027t fall to the ground but his entire body jerked in a way that I knew he didn\u0027t just trip. I was baffled. Something bizarre happened. I turned around to see two high school aged girls, about 15-years-old, glaring at me.Comments (69)Sheila MoeschenSenior Editor I AM THAT GIRL, Freelance writer\"What about Thanksgiving?\" you cry in rage. Where is Thanksgiving\u0027s contribution to the expanding sexualization of holidays? Am I a weirdo, you ask, to think that Thanksgiving should be another day like all the others set aside for national recognition that encourages me to get my freak on?Comments (68)Glennon MeltonBlogger, MomasteryYou guys. They want us to be happy. They\u0027re not saying: My dream is for my mom to be perfect. Or my dream is for my mom to be thinner or better looking. Just: My dream is for my family and my mommy to be happy.CommentsMike LuxCo-Founder, Democracy PartnersSo many people this Thanksgiving are living on the edge. The middle class in this country is no longer just being squeezed -- it is being crushed. And the poor are indeed getting poorer while the rich are certainly getting richer.CommentsAdam GrantWharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027There\u0027s one form of giving that involves few costs, while offering offers dramatic benefits to the people around us. It\u0027s the single best way to help someone fall in love, and the most common way that people find a job. It\u0027s also the reason that the Beatles and the iPhone came to exist.CommentsSarah DriscollWriter, photographer and blogger at Diapers \u0026 DaisiesBeing a father -- to him -- is undoubtedly one of your greatest accomplishments. Share with him the joys of fatherhood, so one day he will want to be a father too.Comments (68)Ellen SnortlandLawyer Activist Author PlaywrightIn case you don\u0027t know women\u0027s history, the idea of dressing women and girls in such a way as to frustrate a rapist is as old as, well, castles, damsels-in-distress, rogue knights and Vikings.CommentsJenny WitteFounder and blogger, Mamatoga.comToddlers and young kids are self-centered by nature, and thankfulness needs to obviously extend beyond just basic good manners. The default mode will always be \"satisfy me,\" and putting others first and being grateful is not natural. It has to be taught.CommentsRobert ScheerEditor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027Finally, Barack Obama may prove deserving of his Nobel Peace Prize by joining with England, France, China, Russia and Germany in negotiating an eminently sensible rapprochement with Iran on its nuclear program.Comments (38)Erin ChruschWriter, Lawyer, MomYou may have heard that there was a football game being played in Regina this weekend. Tens of thousands of fans descend upon Mosaic Stadium to cheer on the home team at Taylor Field. There might have been people there cheering for the other team, but I\u0027ll go out on a short limb and say they were a minority.Comments (14)Parker Marie MolloyAuthor and bloggerI\u0027m not thrilled when someone calls a trans woman a \"tranny.\" Nor am I thrilled that this term, which has been thrown at me on several occasions, is legitimized in the public eye through use by drag queens and cisgender gay men (which most drag queens are).Comments (150)George LakoffAuthor, \u0027The Political Mind,\u0027 \u0027Moral Politics\u0027 and \u0027Don\u0027t Think of an Elephant!\u0027The NY Times has many virtues and some important flaws. Both were evident on the paper\u0027s front page this week and there is a lot to be learned by what did and did not appear there.Comments (315)Kristin Rowe-FinkbeinerExecutive Director/CEO and Co-Founder of MomsRising.orgWhen the first lady is attacked for embracing her role as \"mom-in-chief\" -- despite her leadership in key policy areas like stemming the childhood obesity epidemic, increasing access to healthy food and aiding military families and veterans -- it\u0027s time to call foul.CommentsSandra ShpilbergBiotech executive, advocate for women, writer, momSee, by being born a girl, my daughter does not possess a special disability that prevents her from playing with regular or boy toys. But GoldieBlox seems to be telling my girl that she is too girl to play with the myriad of award-winning (boy) toys in the market.CommentsBernard-Henri LévyFrench philosopher and writerThe great error would be to believe that racism is merely a machine that has to be kept at bay. The great flaw, the fatal flaw, a flaw not only moral but political, would be to imagine that racism is nothing more than hate speech.CommentsMichael KeeganPresident, People For the American WayHarvey Milk, the first openly gay man elected to major public office in California, had held his office for less than a year before he was assassinated. But Milk helped erase some of the invisible boundaries defining who in our country can be elected officials.CommentsGene MarksSmall business management columnist, author, speaker, and business ownerStores will open like normal on Thanksgiving Day. And Christmas Day. And July 4th. And all other holidays. Like it or not, the days of days off for these holidays are going away.Comments (42)Linda TiradoNight Cook, Essayist, ActivistComing up with enough money that you are comfortable is the real American dream, and it is one that the people I am used to don\u0027t believe in as much as hope hard for. I have spent my life on the margins due to my own actions and an equal amount of things that I cannot control.Comments (968)Rachelle FriedmanBlogger; speaker; ambassador for the spinal cord injury communityIf you\u0027ve said any of these, don\u0027t feel bad (unless you\u0027ve stolen a handicap parking spot!). We aren\u0027t angry or offended, but we want people to understand.Comments (1,117)Tristan Bridges, 2013.26.11Avital Zeisler, 2013.26.11Graham Meriwether, 2013.26.11D. R.
