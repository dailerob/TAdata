{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Stephen SchlesingerAuthor and Fellow at the Century FoundationYou know that you\u0027ve failed when a Republican like Joseph Scarborough, host of the MSNBC show Morning Joe, says on his program that Randy Mastro, the so-called \"independent\" lawyer investigating Gov. Christie\u0027s bridge-closing scandal, sounded like Baghdad Bob at his press conference Thursday, and the political writer, Al Hunt -- also on the show -- said Mastro could have served as \"Putin\u0027s lawyer.\" What will Christie do for his follow-up? One thing is for clear -- the woman in the George Washington Bridge scandal, Bridget Kelly, the sender of the traffic tie-up demand, is now in the crosshairs of the Mastro-led counterattack.Comments (20)TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"Rebecca Black. Double rainbows. Nyan cat. Why do some videos made by ordinary people become internet sensations? And what do the videos we love say about who we are? YouTube\u0027s Kevin Allocca breaks it down in this nostalgic viral video tour.CommentsBart D. EhrmanAuthor, \u0027Forged: Writing in the Name of God—Why the Bible’s Authors Are Not Who We Think They Are\u0027How did that happen? How did we get from a Jewish apocalyptic preacher -- who ended up on the wrong side of the law and was crucified for his efforts -- to the Creator of all things and All-powerful Lord?Comments (426)Carla ShutakArtistFive years later I still cry. I cry for our hard work which benefits only the banking industry and the super-rich. I cry because the government bailed out the banks who call us irresponsible. I cry because we work four times harder for half the income and will never catch up again.Comments (247)Emad Shahin, Noam Chomsky and Robert SpringborgIf the United States does not take an unambiguous position and demonstrate unmistaken resolve against Egypt\u0027s current undemocratic path, and if your administration decides to resume suspended aid programs in the face of growing repression and brutality, your words on democracy and human rights will ring hollow.Comments (26)Devon CornealMother, writer, lawyerComplaining about how hard she has it while romanticizing the lives of working parents with more traditional careers means Gwyneth is either remarkably self-absorbed or deliberately obtuse.Comments (53)David BromwichProfessor of Literature, Yale UniversityObama\u0027s Brussels oration bore a striking resemblance to his Nobel Prize speech in 2009. This week\u0027s effort was shorter and less pompous, but, in Brussels as in Oslo, Obama\u0027s words again carried the patina of American superiority.Comments (226)Alex BergAssociate producer and host, HuffPost LiveEven if these writers concede -- with hesitation of course -- that us bisexuals exist, now we do so without a cultural identity?Comments (38)Bob BurnettBerkeley writer, retired Silicon Valley executiveMost Americans understand that by the middle of the century most of our energy will have to be supplied by renewables -- wind, water and solar -- but we seem content to use natural gas for the foreseeable future. Unfortunately, this is not a realistic policy.CommentsChristopher J. FergusonDepartment Chair of Psychology, Stetson UniversityViolent video games don\u0027t exist -- in fact, nor do nonviolent video games. That latter point may actually be easier to demonstrate. Given the way the term \"violent video games\" is defined in the scholarly community, almost all video games are violent video games, including Pac-Man.Comments (17)James ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027It is important to note that the depiction of the Arab\u0027s last century as being a \"cauldron of conflicts\" is most unfair, since fully one half of this period was spent fighting against imperial domination and attempting to remove the last vestiges of colonial rule.CommentsJillian BermanBusiness Reporter, The Huffington PostMy lunch is boring. It can get especially tiresome at the end of a long week when I have the same thing every day. But it fulfills my most important qualifications for a successful work lunch: It\u0027s filling and cheap.Comments (352)Debra RogersRelationship expert and author of \"He Did You a Favor\"It\u0027s more than luck that causes fortune to smile on someone. So don\u0027t leave your love life entirely up to chance. Here are some great tips to make Lady Luck work for you and tip the \"man odds\" in your favor.CommentsGov. Martin O\u0027MalleyGovernor of MarylandThat\u0027s the good news. But not every loving family with same-sex parents lives in a state where their legal rights are protected. And many transgender Americans live in the 32 states where they can still lawfully be denied a job or a home solely on the basis of their identity. That is not right. And those laws need to change.CommentsMarian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundDuring this last week of Women’s History Month, I wanted you to learn about Ella Baker, a transforming but too-little-known woman and overpowering justice warrior for my generation of civil rights activists.CommentsFred WertheimerPresident, Democracy 21The Koch brothers\u0027 enormous wealth does not entitle them to any special treatment when it comes to the right of the American people to know about political money being spent to influence federal elections.Comments (28)Darren AronofskyFilmmakerThis is our garden. We have dominion over it. Are we tending it? Are we keeping it? Will we stand before it with Awe and Reverence, or will we corrupt our way upon it?Comments (148)Dr. Tim MainardiPhysician, researcher and educatorSpring is finally rolling around the corner, and for most of us, that\u0027s a big relief. For many others, however, this revival of life also means the return of sneezing, coughing, wheezing, itching and other vexing symptoms of spring allergies, commonly known as hay fever.CommentsBustleNews, entertainment, lifestyle siteWe can and we must do everything to ensure that survivors\u0027 stories do not go unnoticed. We are obligated to demonstrate the same level of courage they do in combatting sexual assault.CommentsAsh MurthySoftware engineer at GoogleIn search of the American Dream, I had come halfway around the planet to pursue graduate studies in computer science at the University of Southern California. Little did I then know that the green pastures are not so green, at least not without a green card.Comments (22)Scott DannemillerWriter, blogger, worship leader and former missionary with the Presbyterian ChurchSomeday, Audrey, you\u0027ll hear a voice. It might be the voice of your friends. Maybe a shout from a picture in a magazine. Or, Heaven forbid, a comment from your boyfriend. And that voice is going to tell you that you don\u0027t have the right clothes, the right makeup or the right face.CommentsChris WeigantPolitical writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comHouse Republicans now say it\u0027s just too late to pass an extension of unemployment benefits. This, after they spent time this week trying to strip President Obama of the power to create national monuments. Way to prioritize, guys...Comments (29)The Daily MealTheDailyMeal.comWhile the brand extensions we\u0027ll be taking a look at today might have made sense to some exhausted brand development executive somewhere, they certainly weren\u0027t hits with the general public.CommentsSusan CainAuthor, New York Times Bestseller \u0027QUIET: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can\u0027t Stop Talking\u0027In honor of Arianna Huffington\u0027s marvelous book THRIVE, I want to write about a very specific aspect of well-being: freedom from fear of sharing one\u0027s ideas.Comments (14)Steve NelsonHead of the Calhoun School in ManhattanThis is a mere sideshow. Comparing schools -- charter vs. neighborhood public; suburban vs. urban; public vs. private -- is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of education in America.Comments (23)Marianne MollmannDirector of Programs, International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights CommissionThe truth of the matter is that everyone has a right to non-discrimination, and that trans people pretty much everywhere face unique barriers to exercising this right because of stigma, stereotypes and legal obstacles to changing gender markers.CommentsAzhar MajeedDirector, Individual Rights Education Program, Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE)Much worse than the problems inherent in Twitter use, to me, is what this controversy demonstrates about many people\u0027s inability to digest satire and think critically about what it is saying.Comments (19)Zola BooksBooks CommunityRemember the books your parents/teachers/babysitters read to you when you were a kid? When it came to my parents, they chose the books they had loved as children themselves. When my mother read these to me, she would often end up crying at the end.CommentsMadeline RuoffHigh school seniorIt seems every time the topic of suicide comes up, someone attacks suicide victims by calling them \"selfish.\" I\u0027ve heard it in real life; I\u0027ve read it in articles; I\u0027ve seen it on Facebook. But this attitude is disgusting and abhorrent, and completely misunderstands what it means to be suicidal.CommentsJill DoughertyShorenstein Center fellowOnly national unity, in which the individual sets aside his own welfare for the good of the country, Putin believes, can ensure the nation will survive. Russia is a unique civilization, fully entitled to reject the values forced down its throat by the West.Comments (43)Linda LajtermanRegistered nurseWe saw real and true tears at Danny\u0027s funeral from many of the hundreds of kids who came. We have also learned that a few days later, many were back to business as usual waiting for the next chance to get wasted at whatever excuse there is for a party.CommentsSusan Pai, 2014.29.03Reyne Haines, 2014.29.03Rebecca Joseph, 2014.29.03Steven Petite, 2014.29.03Jackie K.
