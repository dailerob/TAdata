{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027At the same time that we are seeing growing support for proposals to increase Social Security benefits it appears that we are witnessing another set of calls for generational warfare. The argument of the generational warriors is that the Social Security and Medicare benefits received by our parents and grandparents pose a threat to the living standards of our children and grandchildren. The generational warfare argument may not make much sense, but many people with money stand behind it. Therefore we are likely to hear it frequently in the months ahead.Comments (50)Yulia TymoshenkoFmr. prime minister of Ukraine; Current leader of All-Ukrainian Union \"Fatherland\" (\"Batkivshchyna\")I feel sorry for the people of Russia. They are being led into a totalitarian abyss of economic and spiritual collapse which goes hand-in-hand with poverty and devastation. Using degrading and immoral means, the Russian government has destroyed the notion of truth with their mad propaganda for the occupation of Ukraine.Comments (66)Blair ChristieSenior Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, CiscoThree things are true in STEM: There are a lot of job openings. These jobs pay well.

We\u0027re told that we cannot go back to natural, regenerative, organic farming as the way we grow our food. In short, this isn\u0027t true.Comments (38)Jack HealeyFounder, Human Rights Action CenterWhat happened to the hope? It is high time that take time to celebrate the example of Saint Patrick worldwide, not by getting drunk and stupid while wearing green. It is high time that we drive the snakes out of politics and move towards the other world that is possible right here and right now.CommentsRep. Debbie Wasserman SchultzAuthor, \u0027For the Next Generation\u0027; Chair, Democratic National CommitteeWhat the RNC and the Republican Party still don\u0027t understand is that their biggest problem has never been their primary calendar, their campaign tactics, or a lack of trainings. Their biggest problem is who they are, what they believe, what they say, and how they govern.Comments (35)Michael WinshipSenior writer, Moyers \u0026 Company on public TV. Senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.Take a moment, please, to note the passing of a distinguished spokesman for the left, a man both firebrand and gadfly, of whom many Americans have never even heard. Yet what he did and said are of importance to us all and especially to the cause of democracy.CommentsJulia MeszarosDoctoral candidate at Florida International University in the Global Sociocultural Studies DepartmentI wonder, once public education is destroyed in this country, will we revert back to the days where only wealthy students were guaranteed an education?

SriramPediatrician in Washington DC, member of the National Physicians AllianceWhat kind of doctor would get the NRA\u0027s stamp of approval? Because any doctor who disagrees with the fact that guns pose a threat to health will not have credibility with the medical or public health community, and would be a disgrace to the title of Surgeon General.Comments (189)Justin RosensteinCo-Founder, AsanaThe things that money can buy haven\u0027t contributed a fraction as much to my happiness as the satisfaction I experience from contributing to the world.CommentsMatt WalshBlogger, talk radio host, father of twinsI usually look upon the media\u0027s shameless sensationalism with a sort of bemused indifference. But I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever been quite as disgusted as I am now, while I watch these news channels and publications turn the likely death of some 280 people into a Tom Clancy novel.CommentsElliott NeginDirector of News \u0026 Commentary, Union of Concerned ScientistsOn March 10, 30 members of the new Senate Climate Caucus held an all-night talkathon on the Senate floor to highlight the urgency of global warming. Later that week, all but one voted to roll back a law that actually does something about it.CommentsKarl \u0027Dice Raw\u0027 JenkinsPerformer, producer, songwriter, and actorSeriously, what makes one group of people OK to target and demoralize versus another batch of humans who are consuming the same amount of the same substance? That\u0027s the question.CommentsSarah ThomasWriter, Writing Instructor at Columbia UniversityThe thing that makes me the saddest about the politics of interracial dating -- which can be just as functional and happy as dating within your race -- is that it pits us against each other. Who is the \"us\" here? Women.CommentsMohamed A. El-ErianChief Economic Advisor, AllianzCan good old-fashioned economic self-interest provide temporary relief for what now seems to be an intractable crisis in the Ukraine?Comments (26)Ryan EvansEditor-in-chief of the online magazine, War on the RocksPutin\u0027s seizure of Crimea is illegal, unjust, and appalling. But I understand that Russia views NATO as a hostile alliance -- one that was founded with the purpose of containing and fighting the Soviet Union -- that has extended into Russia\u0027s immediate neighborhood.CommentsTavis SmileyPBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorTheir latest project is the musical Harmony, based on a real-life German singing group that battled to stay together (and live) as the Nazis ascended to power in 1930s Germany.CommentsKatie GoodmanAward-winning comic, actress, author, creative coach, and social activist; KatieGoodman.comCommentsChade-Meng TanJolly Good Fellow, GoogleWhen it comes to mindfulness meditation, especially how it is practiced and taught in the context of the workplace, I have good news, even better news and bad news.CommentsRajan MenonSpitzer Professor of Political Science, Colin Powell School, City College of New York/City University of New York; Non Resident Senior Fellow, The Atlantic CouncilThere are several lessons to be learned from the Crimean crisis. One is that President Vladimir Putin is not Homo economicus. For Putin, this crisis is about power and prestige, not economic balance sheets.CommentsMargaret McLeanLaw professor, author, former prosecutorIt\u0027s time for heads to roll in the United States military. President Obama and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel must overhaul the system and start firing people. The talk and policy changes are not getting the job done for the thousands of victims of sexual assault in our armed services.Comments (20)Rep. John ConyersDean, Congressional Black CaucusIn a recent op-ed in the Washington Post, Eugene Scalia and Rachel Mondl call on the federal courts to overturn President Obama\u0027s executive order requiring most federal contractors to pay their workers at least $10.10 an hour.CommentsAlon Ben-MeirSenior Fellow, NYU\u0027s Center for Global AffairsThe story of the hundreds of thousands of children in Syria that pass through the gates of hell is yet to be told.

I mean, seriously.CommentsAdam GrantWharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027If we want girls to receive positive reinforcement for early acts of leadership, let\u0027s discourage bossy behavior along with banning bossy labels.

A ring finger and a uterus do not a calling make (Yoda-speak for think bigger).Comments (25)Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The best thing that Democrats -- including President Obama -- have come up with lately are measures to remind voters that Democrats care about the worsened economic condition of ordinary working families and Republicans don\u0027t.Comments (336)Philip K.
