As neighbors, members of civic organizations, sororities and fraternities, and faith communities, create connections for children, youth, and families in your communities who may be suffering silently with no support from family or friends. Make them feel part of something bigger. Let them know you will be there for them. Remember words that have become the Márquez-Greene family’s motto: “Love Wins.” And work without ceasing for common sense gun safety measures to stop the scourge of violence in America.This is the fifth major assault in nine years. When and how it will end is unclear, but here\u0027s what we know for certain: No good will come from this madness; there will be no winners; and when the dust settles and the tears dry, Palestinians and Israelis will be more embittered and will feel less secure.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027So you see my point Tom? You are wrong when you suggest that it was the women\u0027s liberation movement that made it possible to find a 42-year-old woman appealing, or that 42-year-old women flock to yoga and pilates classes to be appealing to men. It isn\u0027t that at all.Senior Writer, The Huffington PostBeing disabled doesn\u0027t automatically make you a noble inspiration to all humanity, says Stella Young. In this very funny talk, she breaks down society\u0027s habit of turning disabled people into \"inspiration porn.\"\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"Most Americans probably think a major goal of philanthropy is to fight poverty. But a closer look reveals that giving by foundations and philanthropists exacerbates wealth inequality in the United States.Senior Fellow, Georgetown Public Policy InstituteHave you ever wondered about the amazingly effective campaign to sell the Common Core standards to the media, the business community, and the public? How did it happen that advocates for the standards used the same language, the same talking points, the same claims, no matter where they were located?Research Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027This is and isn\u0027t about LeBron James returning to the Cleveland Cavaliers. This is about a man growing up and breaking free. To understand the magnitude of LeBron\u0027s decision, we need to examine the Decision.Student, Tufts UniversityReal talk: Ingredients on the side are not the same as ingredients on the food item. There\u0027s a psychological difference that impacts the taste. Picky appetizer people ruin meals (and lives).Writer, humorist, and author of sassandbalderdash.comForgetting can be a beautiful thing, but sometimes we live too much in the present. We forget about all the girls and women we have been.Co-author, Graduates in WonderlandAs a group fitness instructor and health coach, I am often asked the same questions: What do you do to stay fit? What do you eat? How often do you exercise and what do you do? If you are confused as to what\u0027s healthy, you are not alone.National fitness expert, speaker, contributor to Prevention magazine, author of several books and fitness DVDsThe deplorable and frightening violence erupting in Israel and in the occupied territories is not an inevitable blood feud. It is the logical outcome of leaders who cannot come to the table to negotiate peace for the sake of their people.Leeat Granek, PhDMonday night on PBS, the first of my two-part conversation with legendary comedian Joan Rivers. We talked about her longstanding career and her new book, Diary of a Mad Diva. Rivers spoke candidly about what will happen if the moment ever comes when she can no longer perform on stage.PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorAdmire me for what I do -- for writing well, raising decent kids or having a lovely garden. But don\u0027t admire me just for existing, just because I live a mostly unremarkable life with scars and a limp and a history of dozens of broken bones.Author, \u0027No Easy Choice: A Story of Disability, Parenthood, and Faith in an Age of Advanced Reproduction\u0027In fiction, be it on the screen or the page, good guys and bad guys alike take risks. Almost all crime fiction requires that someone (or several someones) get waxed.WriterHave you ever paused and asked the simple question: Where do we go from here? None of you -- Bennett, Haniyeh, Netanyahu, Meshal, and Abbas -- know what will be the fate of Israel and Palestine in five or 10 years should you continue to pursue your bankrupt policy.Senior Fellow, NYU\u0027s Center for Global AffairsAt 29 years old, LeBron James is the biggest superstar in the world. Yet this kid from Northeast Ohio, who had a difficult childhood, is a doting father, a loving husband and a wonderful son. His Akron roots run deep.Hofstra Journalism ProfessorWhat if you heard that other fishermen were unintentionally catching large numbers of vulnerable marine animals like dolphins, whales, and sea turtles -- damaging gear and hurting their own bottom lines? Waste on this scale occurs every day in many U.S. fisheries, hurting both fishermen and marine life.Actor; board member, OceanaCEO, OceanaToday marks 30 years since Geraldine Ferraro became the first woman to join a major party\u0027s presidential ticket. When she joined Vice President Walter Mondale\u0027s presidential ticket in 1984, Geraldine Ferraro didn\u0027t just make history, she changed the political world for women.President of EMILY\u0027s List and American WomenThe most obvious way to neutralize this advantage is for the Republicans to nominate a woman for president. Nominating a woman for president is something very different from finding a previously obscure female politician, putting her on the ticket at the last minute and hoping for the best.lincolnmitchell.comThis summer, as you enjoy time off of work, keep in mind that the little things we do everyday and the opportunities we have to use our voice will have enormous impact for those living in poverty globally.Senior Vice President, Women Thrive WorldwideRecent statements from Israeli officials indicate that this is war, and that it will not end soon. Yet wars of \"self-defense\" against the Gaza strip to weaken Hamas -- in 2008 and again in 2012 -- have proven futile again and again.Foreign Policy Fellow at the Brookings Institution\u0027s Doha Center and Adjunct Professor at Georgetown University in QatarMom was hysterical. Equal parts angry, touched and relieved I wasn\u0027t with child. \"How can I be mad?\" she asked, I had hoped hypothetically. She loved it. But she was definitely kind of mad.Writer. Thinker. Bad hand-shaker.While most McDonald\u0027s restaurant designs are as formulaic as the recipe for a Big Mac, the fast-food giant has more than a dozen cool spots around the world that add a side of ambiance to its meals.TheDailyMeal.comBe smart about your smartphone use. See the phone for what it is: a tool for communication and for information. It doesn\u0027t define you, make you more appealing to others, nor should it rule your life.Licensed psychotherapist, executive coach, columnist, and author of \"Be Fearless: Change Your Life in 28 Days\"You\u0027re going to hear a lot about Obamacare this fall, especially from Republicans. They\u0027ll try to convince you that it was a bad deal. They\u0027ll throw numbers at you to make you think that the cost of health insurance is spiraling out of control. In all likelihood those numbers will be incorrect, but how will you know?Lecturer in the College of Business and Economics at California State University, Los AngelesThe alleged spying on behalf of the NSA by an employee of Germany\u0027s intelligence agency and the transmission of state secrets and classified information to the CIA provide troubling evidence of the American intelligence community\u0027s terrible activities against democratic institutions in Germany.German Parliament MemberBrooke is not inspiring because she is autistic.

And it might just carry us to a surprisingly good election year in a very challenging political environment.Co-Founder, Democracy PartnersOnce upon a time, if a character on TV or in a movie tortured someone, it was a sure sign that he was a bad guy. Now, the torturers are the all-American heroes. We\u0027re not only living in a post-9/11 world, we\u0027re stuck with Jack Bauer in the 25th hour.Author, \u0027Mainstreaming Torture\u0027This deal is being trumpeted as a major win for the American people. It\u0027s not. The money\u0027s not enough (and some of it probably won\u0027t be paid out), the wrong people are paying, and there will be no prosecutions for criminal behavior.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourThe fact is that data are worth a lot of money.
