{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AP/Lauren ShayRove\u0027s pin says “I\u0027m a source, not a target.”07.25.2005 Arianna HuffingtonSometimes it’s not the crime or the cover-up that does you in. Sometimes it’s the counter-attack. Plamegate (aka the Rove-Libby-Gonzalez-Card scandal) is truly opening a window on the soul of the Republican Party… and it’s not a pretty view. No longer content to let the surrogates on the margins do all the smearing, Sen. Pat Roberts, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has now has opted to use the Senate to do his dirty work by holding hearings on whether the CIA’s definition of undercover is too broad. Hmm... I wonder why he’s doing that?Speaking about the Plame case on CNN, Roberts said “I must say from a common-sense standpoint, driving back and forth to work to the CIA headquarters, I don’t know if that really qualifies as being, you know, covert. But, generically speaking, it is a very serious matter.” But not so serious that the Roberts’ committee will be taking testimony on the Plame leaks… just on the question of how, you know, secret a secret agent has to be before, generically speaking, outing that agent should be considered a bad thing.read whole post | permalink | comments07.26.2005 David SirotaYou could make a credible argument that the DLC\u0027s corporatization/Republicanization of the Democratic Party was justified, had it led to electoral success for Democrats. Few would argue that today\u0027s split-the-difference Democratic Party hasn\u0027t followed the DLC\u0027s policy direction over the last 10 years. That means the last 10 years of elections really have been a referendum on whether the DLC\u0027s model actually wins at the polls. And that\u0027s when we get to the real problem with the DLC -- its policies are BOTH morally bankrupt, and politically disastrous.read whole post | permalink | comments07.26.2005 Doug HellerGiven the opportunity to take on President Bush\u0027s (and big business\u0027s) nominee to head the Securities \u0026 Exchange Commission, at today\u0027s confirmation hearing, Senate Dems decided to take a pass. Senators Schumer and Feinstein fawned over this \"colleague on the Hill,\" whose bottom-of-the-barrel record on investor and consumer issues and top-of-the-heap fundraising from businesses he would regulate at the SEC make him a nominee who could and should be blocked. How can you live to fight another day, if you don\u0027t fight in the first place? To get a comedic take on this nomination, watch this video.read whole post | permalink | comments07.26.2005 Rep. John ConyersGoing back a couple of years, I wrote two letters on September 29, 2003 about Treasongate. The first was a public letter (pdf) -- to the Department of Justice asking for a Special Prosecutor. The second (pdf) was not a public letter. It was to Central Intelligence Agency Director George Tenet. I was troubled by reports that the DOJ was, to put it mildly, being less than responsive to the CIA concerns about the leak. The response I received (pdf) added some stunning detail to the Justice Department\u0027s footdragging. The letter indicates that the Central Intelligence Agency was repeatedly stonewalled by the DOJ and, in fact, couldn’t even get their letters answered or calls returned...read whole post | permalink | comments07.26.2005 Adam McKayParticularly hard-headed supporters of the war will trot out hotel receipts from the Falluja Days Inn that show a cousin of an Al Qaeda member once stayed there, but come on. Bush himself says there\u0027s no connection. Let it go. But they can\u0027t quite do that. I sometimes think the inability to admit mistakes has caused about five hundred wars, a thousand building collapses and the trading of Shaquille O\u0027Neal for Brian Grant and Lamar Odom. Give up the ghost. We all make mistakes. I supported NAFTA and was completely wrong. I voted for Ralph Nader for cripes sake. I bought AOL stock. But once again, some people aren\u0027t comfortable raising their hand and saying \"mea culpa\" or \"my bad.\"read whole post | permalink | comments07.25.2005 Harry ShearerGreta von Susteren, Dan Abrams, and Jeff Toobin. Love \u0027em or hate \u0027em, they\u0027re arguably not the dumbest people on cable news, but they\u0027ll play dummies on TV. Check out Howard Kurtz\u0027 column, in which all three bemoan the lack of pictures as the reason why they won\u0027t be doing as much serious coverage of the Supreme Court nomination of John Roberts as they\u0027d really, really like to do. From the little I\u0027ve seen of it, the Natalee Holloway coverage doesn\u0027t have all that many current pix either -- where do you get current video of a missing person? No, it has endlessly repeated family snaps, just as boring (except for the youthful blondness) as the endlessly repeated \"class photos\" of the enrobed Supremes.read whole post | permalink | comments07.26.2005 Marlon RichardsLondon is playing catch up in the paranoia stakes right now. I remember it well, furtive eyeballing of \u0027olive-skinned\u0027 individuals, wide berths for backpack-toting bearded men...that was then (NYC fall 2001), and now... it seems to me that fear is \"the new black.\" We instill it in our people to exert indirect control. London is no newcomer to such things, the IRA had their fun, but what happens when they go away? We\u0027ll get a new bugbear, a disparate, desperate underclass of pissed-off Muslims, ready to subject us to a little Jerry Bruckenheimer magic.read whole post | permalink | comments07.26.2005 Eric BoehlertJohn Roberts\u0027 nomination to the Supreme Court certainly qualified as Big News at both Time and Newsweek, which delivered all-hands-on-deck profiles for this week\u0027s issue. Fawning, glowing, congratulatory, adulatory, Sycophantic. Take your pick, the stories are so over the top they have to be read to be believed, with the only real question being should Fred Thompson—Roberts\u0027 WH-appointed handler--have received ghostwriting credit? I mean, how could Thompson possible top Newsweek\u0027s almost comical portrait of Roberts as a too-good-to-be-true \"centrist\" who\u0027s \"enormously self-confident\" but \"not arrogant or showy.\" An \"unpretentious\" \"regular guy\" with a \"wicket wit\" who \"mows his own lawn.\" According to the weekly he\u0027s loyal to church, family, school and \"most importantly\" (wait for it…) \"to the law.\"read whole post | permalink | comments07.26.2005 Cenk UygurI think the press has been really tough on Karl Rove and the administration over this Valerie Plame scandal, so I wanted to come to their defense a little bit. First of all, Plame might have been a covert CIA operative, but she once sat in a desk and shuffled papers around. If you’re not shooting people in the field every day, then how do you go around with a straight face calling yourself a secret agent? Secondly, Karl Rove was just trying to prevent the press from making yet another error by reporting on Ambassador Wilson’s claims. Joe Wilson was lying about his trip to Niger. The Iraqis were, in fact, trying to buy uranium to build nuclear weapons. That’s why we found all those nuclear bombs in Iraq labeled “Made in Niger.”read whole post | permalink | comments07.26.2005 Marty KaplanThe launch of Discovery brought an undeniable Buzz Lightyear rush. But the NASA voiceover that accompanied it -- \"beginning America\u0027s new journey to the moon, Mars and beyond!\" -- was a rude reminder of Bush\u0027s \"national greatness\" strategy to deflect our attention from the mess he\u0027s made on Earth. Dreams of the Red Planet are the contemporary equivalent of Roman circuses. I\u0027m all for galactic exploration, but the Shuttle and the International Space Station are relics, Tomorrowland curios from the Jetsons era.read whole post | permalink | comments07.25.2005 Deanne StillmanDear Karen Hughes - According to the State Department website, here\u0027s one of the things that you said when you accepted the nomination for Undersecretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs on March 14th of this year: \"I\u0027ll never forget visiting a literacy program overseas where young women were learning to read and I listened through a translator as a 13-year-old girl told me of her dreams of becoming a writer and her belief that women should be able to go to school and work and choose their own husband.\" Now that the rights of Iraqi women are about to obliterated, according to the new draft constitution, what are you going to say to that young girl?read whole post | permalink | comments07.26.2005 Sarah StillmanOk, picture this: a bunch of immigrant workers congregate to attend a safety training meeting being held by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

What does his money pay for? “Neoconservatism is a career,” says Scott McConnell, editor of American Conservative. “One thing neocons have that both other factions of conservatives and liberals don’t have is they can employ a lot of people. AEI provides a seat for the kind of mid-level intellectuals who can produce op-ed pieces. It’s 50 to 100 people with decent prose styles, or Ph.D.’s, and they form a critical mass. They help create the reality of being the dominant strain of conservatism.”read whole post | permalink | comments07.25.2005 Gene StoneLast week Robert Traynham, the chief of staff and communications director to ultra-conservative Senator Rick Santorum (R-Pa.), was outed by the gay press. Many conservatives were angry about what they considered to be a betrayal of the man’s privacy. It’s impossible to believe that any of these people who think that outing is always a bad move have any idea what it’s like to be in the closet. I do--I was stuck there until I was 34. Millions of other men and women are still in it.

It seemed like a good time to get back to the basics of this case. Crawford: \"....But if you spot the critics of Joe Wilson everything they want to say about him and his wife, it doesn\u0027t change the fact that the CIA basically launched an investigation of the White House for leaking an undercover agent\u0027s identity. None of that changes no matter what you say about Joe Wilson.\"read whole post | permalink | comments07.25.2005 Bill ScherInitial coverage of the Roberts nomination noted he is a member of the right-wing legal organization The Federalist Society. Then, White House officials furiously contacted reporters to tell them they got it wrong, Roberts was never a member. Many papers ran corrections. But today\u0027s W. Post shows that the White House, once again, was not telling the full story. Roberts may not have paid dues to the Federalist Society (though even that isn\u0027t clear), but he was listed in the Federalist Society\u0027s \u002797-\u002798 leadership directory as part of one of its steering committees.read whole post | permalink | comments07.25.2005 Norman HorowitzDoes it matter that Joe Wilson was telling the truth about Niger? Yes, but it doesn’t matter as it pertains to Rove/Libby. Does it matter that Ms. Plame suggested that her husband be sent to Africa to investigate the Uranium business? Yes, but it doesn’t matter as it pertains to Rove/Libby. Does it matter what Joe Wilson said, or wrote about what he did in Niger? Yes, but it doesn’t matter as it pertains to Rove/Libby. When I watch the chairman of the RNC appear on Meet the Press and change the subject by attempting to demonize Joe Wilson, and diminish Valerie Plame in front of a compliant Tim Russert, it matters, and matters a lot.read whole post | permalink | commentsFrom local6.comFrom stopcox.orgAP/Tracy A.
