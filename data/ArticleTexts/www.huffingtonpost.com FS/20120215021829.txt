Instead, in the words of an AP headline, \"Social Issues Retake U.S. Politics, 2012 Elections.\" The catalyst for this reorientation of the election was the rule announced by the Obama administration that employers must provide free coverage in their health insurance plans for contraception.

President Obama\u0027s entire reelection effort was now in jeopardy -- if not already hopelessly lost -- due to Birth Contracalypse 2012. To which I say, Seriously? This supposed \"culture war\" may have captured the fevered imagination of the press corps, but not the electorate -- 71 percent of which still says the economy is the most important problem facing America.Read Post | Comments (601)Russell Simmons, 2/14/12Founder, GlobalGrind.comPresident Obama made the right decision several days ago that he was not going to let those who want to take the nation backward outspend him for the attention and public mindset of millions of people who will be influenced by super PACs.Read Post | Comments (68)Bill Moyers and Michael Winship, 2/14/12Our elections have replaced horse racing as the sport of kings.

Too often Pitt and Clooney have been constrained by their leading man status to playing cool protagonists who save the day and get the girl. And they appear to be playing themselves.Read Post | Comments (57)Danielle Crittenden, 2/14/12Managing Editor, Blogs, The Huffington Post CanadaThe reason I dread and fear Valentine\u0027s Day is because, despite being a happily married woman for nearly a quarter-century, my husband has loathed the holiday from the beginning.
