{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027In the past, the story goes, as technology displaced some forms of work, the innovation eventually created new, mostly better jobs: fewer buggy-whip makers, more automobile assemblers; fewer telephone operators, more people designing iPhones and working in Apple genius bars. Technology made society richer on average, and employment took care of itself. But no longer, according to a spate of commentators. Why? Because the pace of displacement has accelerated, and it is reaching well into sectors once thought safe. And automation will only breed more automation. This story is mostly malarkey. Not the automation part; technological displacement of human work is indeed accelerating. The part that is malarkey is the assumption that high rates of human unemployment must necessarily result. They will indeed result if we trust “the invisible hand” to do the transition.Conservatives rhapsodize about the \"free market\" and condemn government intrusion. Yet the market is rigged. And unless government unrigs it through bold antitrust action to restore competition, the upward distributions hidden inside the \"free market\" will become even larger.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027John Nash was a legend. He simply looked at things differently. He taught me that even geniuses need other people to correct their thinking and vet their ideas. Most importantly, however, Nash taught me that anyone\u0027s mind can be beautiful if it focuses on producing beautiful ideas.CEO, Conquer RiskWhile much good has been done to address the issue of veteran suicides, too often the mechanism by which we attempt to provide support ignores the unique challenges these men and women face. To provide the mental health support they require, a new system -- a new model -- is needed.President \u0026 Founder, Sound OffPopular engagement with the country\u0027s misadventures abroad just isn\u0027t what it used to be. Salutes to uniformed servicemen lack the enthusiasm they used to have in the heyday of the war on terror. So, here are some suggestions on how to impart new energy to America\u0027s wars.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghFor years, I bought into the idea that a relationship needed some type of drama to be legitimized. As I\u0027m settling down, I\u0027m realizing how truly wrong and exhausting that mentality was.Journalist, blogger, sober, Mpls.St.Paul Magazine internA FTT is a great way to raise large amounts of money to meet important public needs. It will come almost entirely at the expense of the financial industry and should strengthen the economy. We now have one presidential candidate who is prepared to support a strong FTT. Are there others?Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027We must recognize that striking the \"right\" balance between personal liberty and national security requires constant attention and reassessment. This is especially true following periods of crisis, when there is understandable pressure to tip the scales in favor of national security.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoIf you can distinctly recall the excitement of walking into your weekly computer lab session and seeing a room full of Apple 2Es displaying the start screen of Oregon Trail, you\u0027re a member of this nameless generation, my friend.Director of Content \u0026 Social Media, WebRev Marketing \u0026 DesignSenators who voted last week to Fast Track ratification of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) call it a free trade deal, but really, it’s forced trade imposed on protesting American workers who have endured its damaging effects for decades.International President, United SteelworkersBecause of my recent trip to Africa, I now understand how the Clinton family continues to serve. I had the privilege to travel to five initiatives of the Clinton Foundation in Africa. On the trip, I saw first-hand the quiet appreciation on the faces of President and Chelsea Clinton when they observed the real-life results of their work.CEO of EL RothschildWith these four new trump cards on the table, the odds against fast-track get better -- and almost certainly the next Presidential election will put the candidates of both parties to the test. Trade diplomacy\u0027s House of Cards looks ever shakier -- even if it doesn\u0027t topple in the next few months.Former executive director and chairman, Sierra ClubIf you wish to know what unites, at the deepest level, the fans of jihadism, new-wave Le Pen-ism, and Vladimir Putin\u0027s Eurasia project, then read, without delay, Raphaël Glucksmann\u0027s Génération gueule de bois.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.Despite my effort, many historians continue to see only white soldiers\u0027 suffering and death during the war. But what about those who did not wear the Union blue or Confederate grey but died in the same war often alongside of white soldiers? How we might remember their death and suffering?Associate Professor of History and American Studies, Connecticut CollegeThe press to fast-track TPP is a sellout of democracy, but it is also a symptom of a deeper collapse of faith in American self-government. Increasingly, people who want to get something done find ways around democratic lawmaking: private investment, nonprofit social mobilization, executive actions, lawsuits in the courts, anything but going to Congress.Professor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027Thanks to a 20-year push to avoid making the NAFTA mistake twice, there is now a progressive coalition capable of tossing fast track and corporate-giveaway trade deals into the fiery depths of a congressional volcano. The House of Representatives could very well be the Trans-Pacific Partnership\u0027s Mount Doom.Washington Director, MoveOn.org; host, The Good FightTerminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) has not been demonstrated to work effectively. It pushes China and North Korea to spend more money on more missiles to overwhelm THAAD (just as the U.S. is moved to spend more money on missile upgrades to counteract the missile defense of other countries). And it is a poor substitute for arms-control negotiations.Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogWhen I see the Memorial Day photos of Arlington, I know those simple white markers represent entire lives. They are the boys running across a soccer field, the kid bagging your groceries, the girls playing varsity volleyball -- every one of them somebody\u0027s child who had an entire life of promise ahead.Author, \u0027You Know When the Men Are Gone\u0027We always want to avoid the hurt, anger and sense of loss. But I\u0027m really glad I married my ex because I wouldn\u0027t be the person I am today if I hadn\u0027t.Our mission is to help people love their best.I had lunch recently with a new friend. In the midst of our \u0027getting to know you\u0027 questions, I asked if she had kids. She responded \u0027no.\u0027 The moment was uncomfortable. I felt awkward for asking. We moved on to another topic. This discomfort stayed with me.Author. Blogger. Mentor. Mom. Sharing stories of women reinventing themselves in midlife. Resources and inspiration complimentary.The U.S. has the most powerful military in the history of the world, but it should not be utilized as a political tool or for retribution. The government and its leaders must do their best to make the right decisions, to be truthful with the American people, and to provide all the necessary support needed to fulfill the military\u0027s mission. Unfortunately, this has not always been the case.Hofstra Journalism ProfessorWe have to face the fact that our massive privatization of what once were government functions has been a failure. There are some public services that get really loused up when done privately and for profit.Professor Emeritus, Duke UniversityThe landslide victory for marriage equality in Ireland caught some conservatives off guard. What happened to the staunchly conservative, almost fanatical Catholicism of the Irish people? Paul Valleley, a professor of public ethics at the University of Chester, offered some important suggestions. He lists two major reasons.President, Moorfield Storey InstituteAnne couldn\u0027t have been sweeter or more generous. The last thing she (or Jerry, for that matter) wanted was to have a couple of fans pester them while they attended what was bound to be a memorable comedy show. But they were nothing short of gracious. My wife remembers it as her \"favorite\" birthday. Rest in peace, Anne.Playwright and author (\"It\u0027s Never Been Easy: Essays on Modern Labor\")Memorial Day is, by federal law, a day of prayer for permanent peace. But is it possible to honestly pray for peace while our country is far and away number one in the world in waging war, military presence, military spending and the sale of weapons around the world?Law Professor, Loyola University New Orleans, CCR Associate Legal DirectorAll movements have unsung heroes whose work set the stage for the next generation to come along and make real change. Judge Lee\u0027s impact on the world of bankruptcy was monumental and touched every person in the U.S., but he was one of those people who set the stage for an Elizabeth Warren to come along and make some of the beliefs he felt so strongly become reality.Financial Expert focused on protecting people\u0027s nest eggs.This Memorial Day, I encourage you to go to a cookout, shop a holiday sale, and attend a parade if there is one near you. Offer to go buy red plastic cups, contribute some money to a 12-pack of cheap beer, and enjoy every moment you get to hangout with your families. My friends would want you to remember them that way.American Author and WriterPretty pastels, sky-high cakes, bold brows and gold foil paper are all trending for spring. Here\u0027s how to make them yours.The go-to guide for all things weddingsWhy are victims so often not believed? A large amount of this disbelief may be linked to the behavioral patterns of victims themselves. To understand these patterns, it is helpful to look at how the brain and body respond to stress and trauma, such as that experienced during sexual violence.Committed to the development of mind and brain researchIt is estimated that 80 to 85 percent of the energy consumed in the U.S. is from fossil fuels. One of the main reasons given for continuing to use this energy source is that it is much less expensive than alternatives. The true cost, however, depends on what you include in the calculation, and there are so many costs not figured in the bills we pay for energy.Assistant Professor of Clinical Marketing, Marshall School of Business, University of Southern CaliforniaBeing the somnonaut that I am, I have always been interested in trying to sleep in a R.E.S.T tank. While I was never convinced that I would emerge from the experience transformed into a short, hairy primitive being as in the 1980 William Hurt movie Altered States, I have always believed that the experience could be transformative.Medical Director, Charlottesville Neurology \u0026 Sleep Medicine, sleep medicine, neurology specialistGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
