{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOIn asserting this week that the surge has \"succeeded beyond our wildest dreams,\" Obama was buying into the Republicans\u0027 framing on Iraq. As the Shiite-run Iraqi government is rounding up the Sunni leaders of the Awakening who were at the heart of the reduction in violence, political reconciliation -- the actual goal of the surge -- remains a mirage. McCain\u0027s amnesia platform holds that the outcome of the surge is the sum total of the Iraq scorecard -- wiping everything else clean. Forget invading over non-existent WMD, taking our eye off al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan, war profiteering and the empowering of Iran. And forget that Gen.

I watch them and I think, is anyone buying this? Does anyone think we\u0027re better off today? That we\u0027re \"winning\" the war? Does anyone really think that executive experience trumps wisdom and intellect?Read Post | Comments (598)BIOVan Jones, 09.05.2008How can any candidate or party that hopes to lead America take such joy in putting down American institutions -- like grassroots democracy and its hard-working stewards?Read Post | Comments (126)BIOArianna Huffington, 09.05.2008Listening to the speech, you\u0027d think it was the Democrats who occupied the White House the last seven-plus years and it was time to throw the bastards out.Read Post | Comments (921)BIOAlec Baldwin, 09.06.2008Forget about the fact that Palin looks a lot like a really attractive TV star I know.
