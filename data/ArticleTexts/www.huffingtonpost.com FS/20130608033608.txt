{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoThe notion that we should blindly \"trust\" our public officials to do what is best for us is naïve, reckless and irresponsible. Such an approach invites illegitimate, inefficient and self-interested governance. Even well-meaning public officials make bad policy decisions because of political and personal self-interest. Indeed, if government officials are permitted to keep their actions secret from the American people, all sorts of mischief is possible. Human nature being what it is, we can be sure that, in the long run, secrecy can -- and will -- be used by public officials (who are no better or worse than the rest of us) to hide stupidity, corruption, partisan abuse, discrimination, ineptitude, and outright criminality. Government secrecy is presumptively illegitimate. But note the word \"presumptively.\"Comments (87)David BlaineIllusionistLearning to hold my breath for 17 minutes was an exciting challenge, but here, there was no block of ice, or coffin lid, or even a deck of cards separating me from the crowd.Comments (61)Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOThere is one thing worse than addressing a problem with imperfect solutions. It is not addressing the problem when better solutions are available. Yet this is what seems to happen every month in reaction to the highly-watched employment report.Comments (121)Susan LandauAuthor, \"Surveillance or Security? The Risks Posed by New Wiretapping Technologies\"The invasiveness of this data is hard to underestimate. It is data that reveals where every connected person is during the day, with whom they speak, when, how often.Comments (103)Arianna HuffingtonThis week, Bianca Bosker puts the spotlight on Joel Osteen\u0027s efforts to spread God\u0027s word through social media, and Ryan J. Reilly looks at the hunger strikes that have brought attention -- if only briefly -- back to Guantanamo, and the fact that President Obama still hasn\u0027t honored his pledge to close the prison camp down.Comments (20)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundWhat if we looked at violence in America as a public health crisis rather than a crime problem? What if we look for promising practices and expanded the ones that work to eliminate the epidemic of violence that keeps our graveyards, jails, and prisons full?CommentsJennifer HoelzerWriter, Communications Strategist and Recovering Congressional StafferSeriously, do you have any idea how frustrating it is to have your boss ask you to get reporters to write about something he can\u0027t tell you about? I did it for years and let\u0027s just say, it stretches you as a communicator.Comments (41)David BromwichProfessor of Literature at YaleThe security policy of the U.S. government from Cheney to Obama has passed from secret surveillance of communications abroad to secret surveillance of all communications at home. In what stages did it happen? Some day the history will be written; for now, it is instructive to rehearse the facts.Comments (445)Bob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowMorton Downey succeeded where earlier talkers like Wally George and Bob Grant failed. He turned conservatism into both a rock concert and professional wrestling theater. Out of this innovative mash-up came the slick, in-your-face production values and jingoism of Fox News Channel.Comments (134)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorWhat we have here is a high stakes game of musical chairs, as payrolls grow at a steady, if not-that-impressive, clip, essentially adding chairs to the game. Meanwhile, more players are coming off the sidelines, looking for places to sit.Comments (18)Laura Arrillaga-AndreessenFounder of Stanford Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society; Founder of Silicon Valley Social Venture Fund (SV2); Author, NYTs Besteller \u0027Giving 2.0: Transform Your Giving and Our World\u0027There is huge demand for philanthropic knowledge and tools, and vastly insufficient supply to meet this critical need. By making all my materials freely available through Giving 2.0 ProjectU, I am on a mission to extend philanthropy education to colleges globally and far beyond campus walls.CommentsEthan CaseyAuthor, \u0027Home Free: An American Road Trip\u0027We can, and should, be angry to learn that all of our communications and movements have been secretly monitored for years. But we can\u0027t escape our own responsibility by claiming to be surprised.Comments (35)Tom MulhallNude Recreation Specialist Owner Terra Cotta Inn Clothing Optional Resort, Palm Springs, CAAre you going to dare and go bare this summer? When you take a nude beach vacation, what bugs you?Comments (99)Jordan K. TurgeonLifestyle Blog Editor, The Huffington PostI\u0027m always searching for new workout music, and the main thing I look for -- especially when it comes to running tunes -- is a song with a solid, quick beat.CommentsMontserrat DomínguezEditorial Director, El Huffington PostTelling, opining, or analyzing what is happening is no longer the job exclusively of journalists or of daily columnists: on HuffPost, anyone is invited to do it, just as they are on Twitter and Facebook. Thank you, bloggers; thank you, readers. HuffPost Spain would be impossible without you.CommentsLisa ShufroTEDMED\u0027s managing editor and producerI pulled the card out from my pocket. It reminded me that famous or not, everyone gets scared when they risk failure -- even David Blaine.CommentsPaul RieckhoffFounder, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of AmericaThe hundreds of thousands of brave veterans waiting for VA disability claims deserve to hear directly from the president. Although it is great to hear that the president is taking this issue seriously, the president needs to address many unanswered questions.CommentsMarlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistBy the time they\u0027ve graduated, most college students have completed four years of grueling book learning and are eager to hear a more practical lesson about the real world into which they\u0027re entering.CommentsConrad BlackAuthor and HistorianAfter Vicksburg and Gettysburg, the American aptitude for war would not be questioned again for a very long time. No one except Lincoln and the senior officers of both armies had imagined that the decisive climax of the American constitutional project could be such a noble and terrible combat.Comments (16)Steven RaichlenGrilling Authority, www.barbecuebible.comWhere there is a man and a grill, there is a gadget, so to celebrate fathers everywhere, here are five indispensable tools to help them take their live fire cooking to a scorching level.CommentsCelia Blue JohnsonAuthorMost of the writers I know have adopted a few quirks over time. Famous writers have their own unusual habits.Comments (11)Doug KendallFounder and President, Constitutional Accountability CenterThe claim from the right is that President Obama is attempting to use these appointments to advance his policy agenda. This gets it exactly backwards. It is conservatives who have, successfully, used appointments to the D.C. Circuit to advance their policy agenda in recent years.CommentsAnthony Michael KreisDoctoral candidate, University of Georgia; Political Committee Co-Chair, HRC-Atlanta Steering CommitteeI hope that Southern moderates will come to understand, despite any disagreements about how LGBT equality should be codified in law, that when they fail to speak truth to anti-science, false, and irrational statements dripping with unadulterated bigotry, it has real consequences.Comments (17)Anne-Marie SlaughterBert G. Kerstetter \u002766 University Professor of Politics and International Affairs, Princeton UniversityThe ability to operate effectively in a horizontal web of relationships (a network of networks) is more important than ever. So why is it that the metric of success is still \"getting to the top\"?Comments (85)Jenny BlockColumnist and author of \u0027Open: Love, Sex, and Life in an Open Marriage\u0027Just when I think I\u0027ve seen everything, I realize I haven\u0027t. At all. Introducing breast milk flavored lollipops.CommentsArt BrodskyCommunications consultant, proprietor of Continental Drive blogUnfortunately, for one of Washington\u0027s biggest spectator sports, not only are the rules not clear, the game itself is always out of focus. So in the public interest, herewith is a primer to \"Scandal.\" Not the TV show, but the Congressional show.CommentsRoger Covin, Ph.DPsychologist, Author of \"The Need to be Liked\"When we retrain the body and mind to make uncomfortable physical sensations more acceptable, the outcomes can be remarkable.CommentsMike RyanSenior Entertainment Writer, The Huffington PostIt\u0027s crazy that we live in a world where The Avengers are more popular than Justice League, because until recently that was never the case (think of all of the iterations of Super Friends there have been, which is a watered down version of Justice League). With Man of Steel, the framework is certainly being set, but, at least if we\u0027re looking at Marvel\u0027s blueprint, something seems missing.Comments (88)Abraham R. WagnerSchool of International \u0026 Public Affairs, Columbia UniversityThe FISA Court gets far too little credit for the critical role it performs. Established in the wake of earlier scandals this court provides the type of experienced judicial oversight needed so that the Intelligence Community could continue to operate effectively while meeting the essential concerns of civil libertarians.Comments (61)Christine OrganAuthor; Freelance Writer; BloggerSuccess is not a victory or result, but a perpetual state of mind. It is learning from external paradigms of accomplishment while listening to a compassionate inner voice.CommentsMark CubanOwner, Dallas Mavericks; Chairman, AXS TVTV manufacturers are making YouTube a core part of their application offerings. Their expectation is that YouTube will be a destination for video that will compete with traditional TV.CommentsRobert Julian, 2013. 7.06Ron Herrera, 2013. 7.06William B.
