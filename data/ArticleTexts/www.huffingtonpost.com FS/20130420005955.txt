{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Howard FinemanEditorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupDid you know where Chechnya was? You probably do now. Do you know who Tamerlane was? Maybe you should look him up; the now-dead \"Man in the Black Hat\" was named after the 14th century Mongol conqueror. In ways we never could have imagined, suspected terrorists with roots in a distant land and an ancient history have overrun the streets of Boston and Cambridge that are sacred to our own history. Well, there is no \"own\" anymore. As industrial Britain was rising around him, Wordsworth complained in the 19th century that the \"world is too much with us.\" He had no idea. The Tsarnaev brothers were legal immigrants. They were granted political asylum from a Chechen war that they have now brought to Boston, whether they wanted to or not. Back in the Caucasus, Chechens want their own country. But so do we. And now that is impossible for us both.Comments (366)Brian Levin, J.D.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityMuch speculation revolves around the fact that the brothers are ethnic Muslim Chechens from the Caucasus region where an intermittent, yet bloody conflict has existed for the last two decades, but nationalist sentiment has existed far longer than that.Comments (167)Lisa BelkinSenior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, The Huffington PostWe\u0027ve turned a corner onto a new normal in the last year or so -- a year when everything feels dangerous and personal, close to home, right next door.Comments (57)Robert M. RandolphChaplain, Massachusetts Institute of TechnologyAt 4 p.m. I have a wedding rehearsal. Maybe that is the way to derive meaning from days like today. Look evil in the eye, affirm your love for one another and step forward. That takes a courage that can banish fear.CommentsNathaniel FrankAuthor, \u0027Unfriendly Fire: How the Gay Ban Undermines the Military and Weakens America\u0027Should we have to adopt a belief we don\u0027t really hold in order to feel part of the larger American family who were collectively targeted on Monday, and who are grieving and searching for answers as part of one people?Comments (171)Huffington PostAs Boston remained in lockdown mode while law enforcement agencies continued the manhunt for suspected Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, we invited those in the area to blog about their experience.Comments (24)Arianna HuffingtonThis week\u0027s issue tells the story of the tragedy in Boston in pictures -- the marathon, the bombing, the aftermath, and the runners, onlookers, and first responders who came together to help one another in one of the city\u0027s darkest hours. And as part of our ongoing examination of stress in our lives, we look at how \"derushing\" our careers can yield many benefits in the long run.CommentsFrank WarrenFounder, PostSecret ProjectI began collecting and sharing secrets in 2004. I printed 3,000 self-addressed postcards with simple instructions about sharing an artful secret. I passed them out to strangers on the streets of Washington, D.C., not knowing what to expect.CommentsDavid RopeikAuthor, \u0027How Risky Is It, Really?\u0027Our responses may not make intellectual sense tomorrow, or whenever this calms down (hopefully with no or minimal additional violence), when we can look back at things in the cool calm of rational hindsight, but they make emotional sense now. Because we are afraid.CommentsErica ZidelBoston native and founder of SittingAround.com\"Mommy,\" he said, \"I accidentally turned on the news. I saw the guy.\" He paused for a minute before continuing. \"Mommy, he looked like he was a teenager. That\u0027s a kid, isn\u0027t it? Why would a kid do this?\"CommentsMichael CalderoneSenior Media Reporter, The Huffington PostCNN has received plenty of criticism and mockery for misreporting Wednesday that a suspect had been arrested in the Boston marathon attack. But in a Friday memo to staff, CNN president Jeff Zucker had nothing but praise for the network\u0027s employees.Comments (16)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistI love the New York Yankees, but after this week\u0027s tragedy in Boston, I began to wonder if it would ever feel safe to attend a game again. If the Boston event confirmed one thing to us, it\u0027s that mass violence has officially entered the public square, and that we can never know who -- or what -- the next target will be.Comments (45)Anya SchmemannDirector, Task Force Program, Council on Foreign RelationsMoscow has long claimed that Chechen rebels have close links with al-Qaeda, that Arab fighters joined Chechen fighters during the wars, and that some Chechen militants joined the fight in Afghanistan. These claims may receive additional U.S. attention after the Boston events.Comments (13)Patrick PetittiHarvard Business School student, lifelong BostonianI spent my night in a house with three friends about a mile from the manhunt, with continued warnings that anyone nearby should stay indoors.CommentsSusan NaimarkIndependent consultantHere in my Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston, all is quiet today. Way too quiet. I can count on my fingers how many cars have driven down my normally busy street all day.CommentsWilliam BradleyPolitical Analyst, NewWestNotes.comEven before the wild overnight developments in the Boston bombings -- Russians, Chechens, the Caucuses (sic), Kyrgy-what? -- it was clear that we are culturally unprepared for the complexity of the Boston bombings.CommentsDylan RatiganNew York Times Best-Selling author, entrepreneur and formerly the host of MSNBC\u0027s The Dylan Ratigan ShowYou want to know what is going on in Boston after the attacks on the town\u0027s storied marathon? Check out this message from my friend, former Marine Captain Ryan McGill. Even the closing of city streets for a manhunt hasn\u0027t deterred his desire to keep an even keel.CommentsHahrie HanAssociate Professor of Political Science at Wellesley CollegeAs a parent, how can I go on after learning that my very best efforts are not enough to protect my children from the worst kind of harm?CommentsTony WoodcockPresident, New England Conservatory of MusicThis terrible week will stay in our memories. It is with us now. Unresolved. A scream like the mighty dissonance of that Mahlerian scream in his 10th Symphony. But we will conquer its summit and plumb its depths.CommentsJake FischerSportswriter and Journalism Major, Northeastern UniversityMy iPhone just shrieked with an alert from MEMA that read, \"EMERGENCY WARNING: Shelter in Place still effective.\" I\u0027m looking out my window at the barren streets of this city and imagining what this beautiful 73 degrees and sunny Friday afternoon would look like if it were any normal day.CommentsArt Markman, Ph.D.Executive Editor, Cognitive Science; Psychology and Marketing Professor, UT Austin; Director, the Program in the Human Dimensions of OrganizationsAmericans all feel closer to the city of Boston. Even Yankees fans can put aside their rivalry in the face of tragedy. Why do we feel closer to others in times of crisis? There is a prominent framework in social psychology called \"terror management theory\" that helps us to understand this behavior.CommentsSidonie SawyerNewspaper editorDisasters have a devastating way of putting hurt pushpins on the face of the Earth in a way that no other event can. The tragedies are all vibrant and heartbreaking, whether it\u0027s an orchestrated attack or an act of nature.CommentsJennifer DelaneyNewton, MA residentI feel like I\u0027m living in a crime show. I woke up in Newton this morning on lockdown. I was at the Watertown Library yesterday, we ate at Strip T\u0027s, a couple blocks from (what we are told is) one of the suspects\u0027 house on Marathon Day.Comments (61)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027When real or imagined grievances combine with rage, religious fundamentalism, political extremism, mental illness, or emotional instability, we lose the common good to dangerous violence, fear, and deep distrust in the social environment.Comments (195)Imam Sohaib SultanMuslim Life Coordinator and Chaplain, Princeton UniversityDuring these times in which extremists from many different sides seek to divide us as a nation and as a people with fear tactics, we must resist. And we must not allow fear to take over the best within us and what we have to offer.Comments (53)Julie-Anne WhitneySomerville residentUnlike on 9/11 when, like so many others, I could not tear myself away from the television, I could not seem to bear watching the news this time.Comments (16)The Rev. Sue WintzSpiritual resources can be often overlooked when we are faced with events such as those in the city of Boston this week. Yet they can be one of the best tools we can use. Take the time today to discover yours and put them into practice.CommentsLouisa KasdonCEO, Let\u0027s Talk About Food; Author and former food editorThis week as I can\u0027t tear myself away from my devices, I am heartsick. I cannot believe that Obama\u0027s message from the White House was directed at my city. The big news here last year was Whitey Bulger getting caught in Santa Monica. But terrorism?CommentsLindsey MeadWriter, A Design So VastI sat with them and helped make a Pottermore account, feeling my phone buzzing in the pocket of my jeans as I did so. The temptation to check it was overwhelming. No. Set them up at Hogwarts. This is the perfect place to spend today.Comments (15)Joseph Blady, M.D.Former program officer for the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy and senior analyst for the Under Secretary of Defense for IntelligenceI admit that I have no idea as to how these miscreants got their guns, but I am willing to say without reservation that there\u0027s something seriously wrong in a country where private citizens own 300 million guns and are still bitching that their 2nd Amendment rights are being threatened.Comments (327)Eric BoehlertSenior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaIn the same week that Pulitzer prizes were announced honoring the finest in American journalism, many in the far-right media worked to set news standards in mindless, awful behavior in the wake of the Boston attack.Comments (24)Ivy M.
