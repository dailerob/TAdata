{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarWould a female president have pushed us into the second Iraq War? Would the stereotypical female drive for collaboration and consensus have tempered the primarily male certainties of American exceptionalism? We won\u0027t know until the next global face-off when there is a female at the helm. If Hillary Clinton becomes that female in 2016, we will, for the first time in history, see female leadership qualities settle in behind the desk in the Oval Office. Will those qualities be a global object lesson that sets a new tone for leadership? Or will the pressures of the office and the realities of politics force them to the side in favor of a harder edge and a bit of swagger? Odds are, we\u0027re about to find out what leadership looks like when the leader of the free world is called Madam President.Comments (73)Melinda GatesCo-chair, the Bill and Melinda Gates FoundationThis week, I\u0027m on a trip with two important stops: the Glamour Women of the Year Awards in New York City, then the International Family Planning Conference in Ethiopia. I can appreciate how this ensemble might appear to clash -- the red carpet next to the green-brown fields dotting a country that\u0027s 80 percent rural. But sometimes juxtaposing seemingly incongruous things can reveal an underlying truth.Comments (51)Marcia SimmonsCo-author of \"DIY Cocktails\"While Superman, Wonder Woman, and Spiderman are fictional, their superpowers may soon be very real, thanks to scientists who believe there are no limits to innovation. Keep your eye on these five real-world technologies that can give ordinary humans extraordinary abilities.CommentsJarrod S. ChlapowskiWriter, teacher, veteran and recovering lobbyist, very much in that orderI still witness those thank yous being given to vets and service members who actually do deserve them. But they\u0027re still shouts across a canyon that isn\u0027t getting any smaller. The civilian-military divide is still as large as it ever was.Comments (320)Jon HotchkissCreator, ThisvsThatShow.comFor this new post, I\u0027ve gone back and re-watched the same 5 hours of FOX News as I did last week. You\u0027d be surprised how much blood spilled from my eyes this time, what with the scars from last week still raw and moist. Anyway, this time I didn\u0027t look for scams. I looked for African Americans.Comments (61)Belle Beth CooperContent crafter, BufferI would love to be happier, as I\u0027m sure most people would, so I thought it would be interesting to find some ways to become a happier person that are actually backed up by science. Here are ten of the best ones I found.CommentsRev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkRenisha McBride\u0027s death is a tragedy that simply didn\u0027t have to take place. It raises many questions about preconceptions, bias, profiling, motive and more -- all of which need to be thoroughly examined and investigated.CommentsSarah Klein, Jordan K. Turgeon and Meredith MelnickEven as a group of like-minded health editors, we are all different runners. But we can agree on one thing: Running is a source of endless wisdom and not just about fitness. Here are a few of the things being a runner has taught us.Comments (33)Mark Penn and Don BaerGiven the state of our economy today, we may not have the luxury of a moonshot like the GI Bill or the invention of the Internet to restore Americans\u0027 faith in opportunity. But we must do something, because our young people are internalizing the melancholy as the new normal.CommentsRobert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027What Edward Snowden has done is to force a long repressed debate about how much liberty, if any, we need to sacrifice in order to protect our security.Comments (420)Allison VesterfeltWriterIf I had it to do over again, I would have given myself some context for how much money $20,000 or $30,000 really was. I would have spent some time thinking through each of my options, to weigh whether this was a worthy investment or not.CommentsWait But Whywww.waitbutwhy.comIt\u0027s a dictatorship of the most extreme kind, a cult of personality beyond anything Stalin or Mao could have imagined, a country as closed off to the world and as secretive as they come -- a true hermit kingdom. So why would an American tourist ever be allowed into the country?CommentsRichard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureIt\u0027s not easy to maintain a civil tone while describing the magnitude of the misbehavior among executives at Wall Street\u0027s largest institutions. To criticize bankers is to describe large-scale wrongdoing, mass-produced outrage which leads to widespread misery.Comments (67)Eric BoehlertSenior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaWhy did the National Guard story require a painstaking autopsy performed by outside observers, but Benghazi garnered just a 90-second correction on 60 Minutes? Are CBS executives that nervous about what an autonomous review might undercover this time?Comments (46)Arin GreenwoodEditor, HuffPost DCI left a well-paying lawyer job in New York to move to a small tropical island near Guam. I\u0027d like to say it was some sort of insight about the Meaning Of Life. In reality, it was a terrific combination of terrible things in the romance, personal well-being and employment departments.CommentsMichael VlahosWriter and National Security expertRemembering is important, but remembering uncomfortable truths is more important. Most important today is our collectively knowing that, unlike America in 1963-64, we have finally tired of war, and the deaths of so many -- at least for now.CommentsRep. Patrick Kennedy and Garen StaglinAs Americans, we have a duty to provide our nation\u0027s heroes with the care and resources they need. Health care reform provides an historic opportunity to find new, collaborative approaches that could better serve them.CommentsSen. Jay RockefellerU.S. Senator, West VirginiaDespite legal protections, members of the military are still ripe targets for abusive financial practices. Many soldiers are young and inexperienced with their finances, and living on a military base in foreign country makes it difficult to shop for the insurance rates.CommentsRalph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorMany so-called \"blue states\" welcome Target with open arms while shunning Walmart for their anti-worker practices. So this begs the question -- is Target really any better? Is this line of thinking justified?Comments (29)Christine PelosiChair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusWe have the power this Veterans Day to use more than words but deeds to honor veterans. Our time of service begins with acknowledging that far too many service members past and present are fighting an invisible war from PTSD and military sexual assault.CommentsPeter YeomansStaff psychologist, Philadelphia VA Medical CenterMany men and women are suffering from severe psychiatric diagnoses that are a result of their service. Yet, to only see this as psychopathology is to overlook the depth of character and clarity of values that can emerge from life altering experiences.Comments (12)David J. EicherEditor-in-Chief, Astronomy magazineComet ISON (C/2012 S1), the much-anticipated visitor from the distant depths of the solar system, continues to brighten and this week should reach naked-eye visibility as seen from a dark sky, away from city lights.CommentsFrancine MaderaEntrepreneur, MADERA, inc.,Our home is the most climate vulnerable city in the U.S. primarily due to sea level rise. Miami needs to adapt to climate change immediately if we want to survive as a metropolis.CommentsRichard TrumkaPresident, AFL-CIOToday we celebrate Veterans Day. Let\u0027s take this opportunity to honor the men and women who have served our nation to protect and defend the freedoms we all enjoy. But we shouldn\u0027t just talk about \"honor.\" America\u0027s veterans need action, not words.CommentsKerry CoddettComedianIf SNL isn\u0027t finding great black female talent, maybe it\u0027s because the characters we want to play don\u0027t fall in line with the caricatures they\u0027re used to seeing. Maybe it\u0027s SNL that isn\u0027t ready -- to be progressive, break tradition and have a writing team that isn\u0027t 95 percent white for once.Comments (97)Leo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersIn a shocking turn of events, Republicans now care about whether Americans have health insurance! It happened quite suddenly. The moment can be precisely pinpointed. It occurred early in the day of Oct. 1 when the media declared the launch of the Affordable Care Act website a fiasco.Comments (79)Adam HochschildAuthor, \u0027To End All Wars: A Story of Loyalty and Rebellion, 1914-1918\u0027As the years have passed, one point that has come to symbolize the illusions, the destructiveness, the hubris, the needless deaths of the entire war -- and of other wars since then -- has been the first day of the Battle of the Somme.CommentsJames ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027For those of us who\u0027ve worked with Dearborn Michigan\u0027s Arab American community during the past three decades, victories in this past week\u0027s municipal elections were more than just big news. They represent confirmation of our belief in the strength and vitality of the Arab American community.Comments (17)Steven StraussAdjunct Lecturer in Public Policy, Harvard Kennedy SchoolIt\u0027s been over 15 years since PM Netanyahu\u0027s speech to a joint session of Congress stating Israel\u0027s goal of economic independence. In 1997, Israel received $3.1 billion in aid from the U.S. In 2012, Israel was still receiving $3.1 billion annually in U.S. aid.Comments (201)Vivian GreentreeNavy veteran and spouse; Director of Research and Policy for Blue Star FamiliesAre they like superheroes, preternaturally disposed to keep calm and carry on? Or do they know some tricks and secrets to cope with the constant anxiety and the high-stress situations?Comments (14)Don TapscottAdvisor to government and business leaders; Author, \u0027Macrowikinomics\u0027Ford and his drug-dealing pals reflect a deeper problem than just substance abuse. It\u0027s another example of the growing crisis of legitimacy of our democratic institutions.CommentsThomas E. PerezU.S. Secretary of LaborThe question isn\u0027t: Why would you want to hire a veteran? The question is: Why wouldn\u0027t you? They represent the very best America has to offer. If we trusted them with the nation\u0027s security, why wouldn\u0027t you trust them with a responsible job?CommentsBlue Carreon, 2013.11.11Michael Kleinmann, 2013.11.11Michael Kleinmann, 2013.11.11Michael A.
