{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Chinese president Xi Jinping will be in Washington this week on an official state visit. President Obama had hoped to impress Xi with an all but sealed trade deal with major Pacific nations called the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) to demonstrate that America is still a force to be reckoned with in China\u0027s backyard. But Obama\u0027s trade policy is in tatters. The grand design, created by Obama\u0027s old friend and former Wall Street deal-maker, trade chief Mike Froman, comes in two parts -- a grand bargain with Pacific nations aimed at building a U.S.-led trading bloc to contain the influence of China, and an Atlantic agreement to cement economic relations with the European Union. Both are on the verge of collapse from their own contradictory goals and incoherent logic.This was the last election that Tsipras could win purely on the basis of the failure of the other candidates. The next time, be it in one year or in four, voters will judge him, rather than his opponents. Is Tsipras ready for this?Associate professor in the School of Public and International Affairs at the University of GeorgiaThe geopolitical aspects of the conflicts in the Middle East must not conceal such an enormous humanitarian tragedy, in the face of which the international community, and especially the United Nations, must no longer remain idle.President of BrazilMuch of the attention for Pope Francis\u0027 tour will be focused on the marquee events at which he will address the powerful members of governments from around the world and within the U.S. While these high-profile events matter, they are not the most important on the pontiff\u0027s agenda.Executive Editor Of Global Spirituality and Religion, The Huffington PostOnce you start to think about the challenges that victims of sexual assault face when they try to get help, you may better understand why fewer than 10 percent of victims end up reporting the crimes. But a simple technology tool promises to make it easier to protect victims and end the culture of silence around sexual assault.Head of Research and Development, Google IdeasRather than relying solely on national level leadership to foster change, we believe local governments and the private sector need to play a more central role in shaping the world\u0027s climate change action plan.Hillhouse Professor of Environmental Law and Policy at Yale UniversityCEO, Rexel GroupYet we too, messengers of peace, have a global force to be reckoned with. We live in an interconnected world. Our global village is more accessible and more informed than it has ever been.Former President of the State of IsraelOne can only hope the Pope\u0027s visit reminds people that the highest level of morality is tolerance and not beating down those with different beliefs or views. One can only hope. Can we now learn to live together even when trying to aspire to whatever office it is that we seek? That is the test of true leadership.President, National Action NetworkThe city\u0027s residents are currently selling all they own in order to bribe regime officers into letting them out, but smuggling people out of Deir Ezzor has become more expensive than migrating to Europe. With no end in sight and no intervention, Deir Ezzor is dying, slowly and painfully.Human Rights Activist, Freelance PhotojournalistThe main barrier to rebuilding America\u0027s decrepit infrastructure is not financing, but red tape. Delays of a decade or longer are common. Now, ironically, it turns out that years spent in environmental review dramatically harm the environment.Author, \u0027The Rule of Nobody: Saving America from Dead Laws and Broken Government\u0027We often forget that the Greek problem is Europe\u0027s problem. The ongoing debt crisis proves this, and the chaos that the migration and refugee flows have unleashed emphasizes it.Editor in Chief, HuffPost GreeceThe liberal establishment is shocked that their shallow assumptions about what moves the American body politic are being exposed as the facile consensus of those with a stake in the status quo -- intellectual, political and economic. A critical look at those premises reveals much about how skewed our public discourse has become.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghIn the last two debates there has barely been any mention of veterans, and the talk of going to war only increases. The only mention of veterans is in a jingoistic rather than practical way. Veterans and their issues are being widely appropriated for the political gain of candidates, but no one seems to have an actual plan when it comes to VA reformVeteran, writer and mental health advocate being portrayed in the film \"Light Wounds\"My brother was killed 14 years ago in the World Trade Center by terrorists who claimed to be devout Muslims. I have learned that what they claimed to be is irrelevant. What they believed, their fears, their warped world-views -- that\u0027s what was significant. It mattered what made them tick, not what religion they claimed.Former State Senator, (D)- Oklahoma. Publisher of @nondocmediaIn a GOP field filthy with candidates who kiss up to corporate bosses and systematically suppress workers\u0027 wages, Walker is a stand out. But the whole motley GOP crew is determined to do whatever it takes to deny workers and their children economic mobility.International President, United SteelworkersThe political power of the Pope cannot be ignored. It is a worldwide force to be reckoned with. The new pope, Francis, is making an impact within the Vatican and the Roman Catholic church.Associate Professor of Theology at Earlham School of ReligionPolitical scientist Larry Sabato once said, \"Every election is determined by the people who show up.\" Though the quote is at first blush rather banal, it carries profound implications for American democracy.WriterClimate change denial isn\u0027t actually about the science. It\u0027s about opposition to regulation. It is about science-denying front groups, industry shills, bought-and-sold politicians, and other bad faith actors who continue to provide cover for corporate polluters like ExxonMobil by fooling the public.Director of Penn State Earth System Science Center; Author of \u0027Dire Predictions\u0027 and \u0027The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars\u0027It\u0027s good to know that a presidential candidate is aware of the multimedia storytelling of Futuro Media and Latino USA. But the real proof of Clinton\u0027s stand with Latinos -- or that of any other candidates -- will be if they create access points for us to discuss the issues Latinos care about.Founder, The Futuro Media Group; Executive Producer/Anchor, NPR\u0027s Latino USA; Executive Producer/Anchor America by the Numbers with Maria HinojosaCarly Fiorina has a big problem with the truth. More specifically, she has a problem with embellishing the truth, in a manner very reminiscent of disgraced NBC anchor Brian Williams. In what is becoming a pattern, Fiorina takes what is true, and adds made-up embellishments (lies) to it, for dramatic effect.Public Relations Consultant, www.winningprogressive.comdesigner/illustrator/bboyLegislators in Congress and the Senate have vowed to shut down the federal government unless Planned Parenthood is defunded: a move warmly endorsed by Fiorina herself. In fixating on a fake video, however, Republican lawmakers blind themselves to the following FACTS about Planned Parenthood.Writer, lecturer, blogger, founder of online book reviewA clean escalation doesn\u0027t guarantee the right decision, but it produces a more intelligent process that strengthens relationships and helps everybody feel appreciated as valuable contributors.Founder and Chairman, Conscious Business Center InternationalAt the check-in line at San Francisco International Airport, we handed over our driver\u0027s licenses and waited for the airline ticket agent to find our flight and reservation. Suddenly, she got a funny look on her face. \"There\u0027s something wrong with the computer,\" she said. \"I need to talk to my supervisor.\"Author, \u0027Mainstreaming Torture\u0027In our world\u0027s most accepted definition of a parent, I will never meet the criteria. I will never birth a child and I am not adopting one. So you will call me childless. And, I will then emphatically and stubbornly correct you and let you know that I am a childfull parent, birthing a rare kind of parenthood.Author of Ever Upward.Childfull Parent.

Friend, Wife, Dog Mom and Accidental Monarch Farmer www.everupward.orgIntegrated Information Theory (IIT)--put forth by neuroscientists Giulio Tononi and Christof Koch--is a new framework that describes a way to experimentally measure the extent to which a system is conscious.Neuroscientist (PhD) and creator of the blog Science Is Sexy (scienceissexy.com)Trump cannot answer the Obama place-of-birth question because he would either have to lie outright, or state that Ted Cruz is ineligible to run for president. Trump likes Cruz. He does not want to have to say that. But, he must, or admit that his entire Obama birth certificate campaign was a complete scam.Last person on Earth not on FacebookRepublicans have staked out endless signature issues: shutting down the government, vilifying immigrants, denouncing rights like paid sick leave and equal pay because they are \"women\u0027s issues,\" privatizing education, and--wait for it--obliterating the rights of working people to negotiate together for better wages and benefits that can sustain their families.President, American Federation of TeachersBeyond aggressively marketing herself as the female anti-Hillary, hardly a credential in itself, her candidacy rests solely on a tenure as CEO, which ended in her firing. By comparison to other business leaders who have run for president or pondered doing so, Fiorina\u0027s record at Hewlett-Packard is less uplifting saga than dead weight, suggesting that she lacks the capacities essential in a successful president.Author, political commentatorAn honest comparison between Clinton\u0027s actions in 2008 and the record of Bernie Sanders on racial and economic justice will lead to one conclusion: Bernie Sanders will win South Carolina and other Southern states, primarily because he\u0027s never utilized race as a means to win an election.Columnist published in The Cleveland Plain Dealer, The Baltimore Sun, The Hill, Salon, The Jerusalem Post www.hagoodman.comI\u0027ve only taken a small step forward, but it feels monumental. How must the refugees feel? They have to take hundreds of steps like this one, just to trade their old lives for new ones.Christoph Asche is the Politics Editor at HuffPost GermanyGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
