{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Michael KeeganPresident, People For the American WayRep. Steve King of Iowa told a local TV station a few weeks ago that \"the best thing anybody can do\" in Congress is not come up with positive solutions, but to \"kill bad bills.\" He wasn\u0027t just speaking for himself. He was explaining the philosophy of today\u0027s right wing. Of course elected officials should oppose bills they disagree with. But King and his party have taken this to an extreme, opposing any efforts to use the power of government to fix problems that affect ordinary people. This anti-government strain of the Tea Party that is calling the shots in today\u0027s GOP doesn\u0027t represent just hands-off libertarianism, as many would like us to believe. The Tea Party does want government to work: but they only want it to work for a few of us.Comments (64)Gary HartUnited States Senator (Ret.)The age of communications, mass social media, ubiquitous technology, and of mass interception (and thus of Snowden) is a new world... and not an especially brave one.CommentsTrita ParsiPresident, National Iranian American CouncilThe defeat of AIPAC\u0027s ill-advised push for new sanctions on Iran in the midst of successful negotiations is nothing short of historic. The powerful and hawkish pro-Israeli lobby\u0027s defeats are rare and seldom public. But in the last year, it has suffered three major public setbacks, of which the sanctions defeat is the most important one.Comments (29)Jeffrey SachsDirector, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \"To Move the World: JFK\u0027s Quest for Peace\"The AEI, despite its roster of distinguished academics, has failed to be constructive in the climate debate. It\u0027s time that the AEI puts forward a strategy to achieve the globally agreed objective of avoiding dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.Comments (24)Deborah CaldwellReligion and politics writerSure, the religious right is still teamed up with conservative politicians in their battle against gay marriage, abortion, and immigration reform -- but the days of Americans actually heeding what they say is over.Comments (195)Howard FinemanEditorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupFor people of a certain age -- I am one -- the Beatles seven years atop the pop charts precisely tracked the passage from early adolescence to what society said was adulthood: from \"Please Please Me\" to \"Let it Be.\"CommentsMegan GriffoAssistant Editor, Good News, The Huffington PostIf done right, a good news porn addiction doesn\u0027t take hold of your life -- rather it empowers you to help improve others\u0027.Comments (12)Tony PottsFormer Host/Correspondent Access Hollywood/Founder Dot N\u0027 Feather IdeationAs I watched Jay Leno say goodbye on his final Tonight Show, I started thinking about all of my experiences with Jay, the stars on his show, the various wild animals roaming the halls and his incredible staff.CommentsAda PollaCo-creator, Alchimie ForeverMaybe it is because we are 1/12th done with 2014 already. Maybe it is because in 8 months I will be unarguably closer to 40 than to 30. Who knows... in any case, I have been thinking about what I long for.Comments (35)Kathleen AnnFreelance writer from New EnglandI\u0027m not a \"Never Had.\" I know what it\u0027s like to pay bills on time and have a little left over. I remember vacations and pedicures and going out to dinner. As a \"Used-to-Have,\" I know exactly what Corporate America, lobbyists and politicians have taken away from me.Comments (1,391)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorIf the law is to be understood and obeyed, it must be public information. How can we follow the law if we don\u0027t know what it is? This is the astonishingly unfortunate reality for a large number of our nation\u0027s laws.Comments (23)Rob ReinaldaWriter, 28 years in print journalismDo you enter your PIN number at the ATM machine? Well, stop it. PIN stands for personal identification number. ATM stands for automated teller machine.Comments (15)Cecile RichardsPresident of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, \u0026 Planned Parenthood VotesIn the weeks and months to come, Planned Parenthood will continue to join our allies in urging members of Congress to put politics aside and work together to restore voter protection under the Voting Rights Amendment Act.Comments (12)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, Beyond OutrageMost Americans are on a downward escalator. Median household pay is dropping, adjusted for inflation. A smaller share of working-age Americans are in jobs than at any time in the last three decades.Comments (157)David WildTV Writer; Contributing Editor, Rolling Stone; Co-Author, \u0027Everybody\u0027s Brother\u0027I never met John Lennon. \"You would have loved him,\" Ringo told me once casually, and I had to laugh. The truth is I have loved John Lennon all of my life.Comments (63)Elizabeth CraneAuthorWhen I was newly sober, Philip Seymour Hoffman was part of a crew of my closest friends. I cannot overstate how much each person in that group meant to me, then and now; we were part of a greater thing, and we all helped each other whether it was deliberate or not.CommentsAdlai E. Stevenson IIIFmr. member, U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee; Chairman, Adlai Stevenson Center on DemocracyThe debate over the NSA\u0027s data collection should lead to a better balance between rights of privacy and requirements of foreign intelligence. But whatever the outcome of that debate, it has failed to acknowledge inherent deficiencies and risks in \"foreign intelligence\" and the transcendent role of foreign policy in the defense of our national interests.Comments (30)Daniel GrossPresident, Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and the Brady Center to Prevent Gun ViolenceThis isn\u0027t a gun issue. It\u0027s a responsibility issue. Thousands of tragedies, in homes across our country, could be prevented if parents and others had more responsible attitudes and behaviors about the real risks of guns in the home.Comments (22)Oliver EmbertonEntrepreneur, writer, programmer and artistYou might not realize, but real life is a game of strategy. There are some fun mini-games -- like dancing, driving, running, and sex -- but the key to winning is simply managing your resources.CommentsMensenBrooklyn-based muralist, public artist and community facilitatorFind something that makes you feel like the world makes sense. Personally, if I don\u0027t get up, get laid, get down on a dance floor, read a good book, write a poem, listen to a mind-blowing record or have a soul-shaking, satisfying conversation at least once a week, the world doesn\u0027t make sense to me and I am unmoored.CommentsHarold BronsonCo-founder, Rhino Records labelAlthough the Beatles\u0027 records demonstrated a high degree of musical proficiency and exuberance, they weren\u0027t explicitly comedic. So where did the humor come from?CommentsArianna HuffingtonIn this week\u0027s issue, Lynne Peeples travels to the Celilo Indian Village in Oregon, where the push for a coal-export superhighway is a growing concern for the local Native American community.CommentsRichard (RJ) EskowSenior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host, Take Action NewsReagan\u0027s economic legacy is one of failure, but in another way it could be argued that he was genuinely transformative: as the first celebrity politician for the modern corporate state.Comments (121)Peter H. GleickPresident, Pacific InstituteThe costs of drought vary widely from sector to sector, and often include things that are hard to measure or to quantify. It is difficult to report on drought costs in a comprehensive or consistent way. And until a drought ends, it is impossible to know the ultimate costs.CommentsMelody Lynn HoffmannProfessor of Communication Studies at Gustavus Adolphus College; Transportation equity advocateFraming the story as \"safe bicyclist still dies\" rather than \"drunk driver kills bicyclist\" continues to highlight the necessity for bicyclists to prove that they do not deserve their injuries or death.Comments (12)Terry O\u0027NeillPresident, National Organization for WomenLaws that restrict or deny access to reproductive health care procedures are openly discriminatory against women. How many lawmakers do you know who have dreamed up restriction after restriction after restriction to block men\u0027s access to vasectomy?Comments (36)Scott ShigeokaDigital storytellerI scraped by living in Washington, D.C., one of the most expensive cities in America, for nearly eight months with no steady income. I kept telling myself, \"This is the city of opportunity. You can make this work.\"Comments (21)Lincoln Mitchelllincolnmitchell.comThe leap between being surprised on Election Night in 2012 and believing climate change is a hoax is not that big. In both cases, eschewing scientific approaches leads to fundamental misunderstandings of reality.Comments (341)James MooreBest selling author, TV political analystI know politics is all about compromise. I know we sometimes have to settle for not getting everything we want in a candidate. But there are some things I refuse to accept in a potential leader. Pandering to the right to support Open Carry Laws fits in that category. I\u0027m sitting out this Texas gubernatorial election.Comments (138)Kathreen KhavariActor, writer\"Brain of Terror\" is about a woman who binges on episodes of Showtime\u0027s popular series Homeland, then dreams that she\u0027s terrorist, prompting her subconscious to panic.CommentsBob BurnettBerkeley writer, retired Silicon Valley executiveWhat we learned in 1971 is essentially the same thing we learned from the Snowden documents. The federal government is conducting illegal surveillance on Americans. Edward Snowden is a whistleblower. He is a patriot.Comments (13)Henriette Lazaridis Power, 2014. 8.02Matt Murrie, 2014. 8.02Tom Frieden, MD, MPH, 2014. 8.02Toan Lam, 2014. 8.02Tama Kieves, 2014. 8.02Jackie K.
