The Littoral Combat Ship is a classic example of why it\u0027s so hard to reduce budget deficits. In the end, defense spending plays out the same way as Social Security. If you want to reduce government spending, you obviously have to reduce defense spending: it\u0027s basically the second biggest part of the budget after Social Security. But it\u0027s almost impossible to cut any actual defense spending. Apparently politicians don\u0027t realize that a whole is equal to the sum of its parts. Or they do realize it, and they hope that we don\u0027t.Read Post | CommentsDr. Peggy Drexler, 04/05/12Author, \u0027Our Fathers, Ourselves. Daughters, Fathers, and the Changing American Family\u0027A gay man can grin and say ironically, \"I\u0027m a really good mother,\" which may mean that he performs the daily child care in his home, but his comment does not define him as a mom. Nor is a lesbian who coaches her son\u0027s hockey team a father. Both are just doing what parents do.Read Post | Comments (46)Joy Marini, MS, PA-C, 04.05.2012Director, Corporate Contributions, Johnson \u0026 JohnsonThere are moments in all of our lives that take our breath away - moments that are either so stunning or emotionally moving that time seems to stand still. But not every mother gets to have that breathtaking moment, because not every baby takes a first breath.Read Post | Comments (2)Robert Gallucci, 04/05/12President, John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur FoundationNations with nuclear material -- whether military or civilian -- must secure and eliminate stocks of highly enriched uranium and plutonium. The threat of nuclear terror is not just possible, it is quite plausible; if effective action is not taken, over time, it is probable.Read Post | Comments (11)Jacqueline Novogratz, 04/05/12Founder and CEO of Acumen Fund, Author of The Blue SweaterStanding with the poor ultimately means deciding to do what is right, not just what is easy.

But our political and media establishments seem to regard being in a constant state of war as simply part of the \"new normal\".Read Post | Comments (1,818)Greg Jenner, 04/05/12Historical Consultant to CBBC’s multi-award winning sketch show Horrible HistoriesEaster is just one of many confusingly indistinct holidays that blend weird paganism, Christian theology, and modern marketing into a seamless melange of oddly abutting practices and customs... so how much of Easter really is Christian in origin? It may be more than you realise.Read Post | CommentsRick Steves, 04/06/12Writer of European travel guidebooks and host of travel shows on public television and public radio (www.ricksteves.com)We brought a Frisbee and only managed to toss it around once.

New research may offer some insight on this question.Read Post | CommentsSarah Shourd, 04/05/12Writer, Former Hostage and Advocate for Political Prisoners in Iran, United4IranMr. Masoud Shafii did everything in his power to defend Josh\u0027s, Shane\u0027s and my innocence within the parameters of Iranian law.

It was mid-July in the mountains: the trees were ridiculously green; the hummingbirds sipped sugar water.

If due attention is to be paid, we have to figure out a language in which to talk about them that will make it clear just how loony our policy is.Read Post | Comments (210)Robert Scheer, 04/05/12Editor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027The GOP has defined itself indelibly as the party of moneyed greed and unfettered imperialism.

War without consequences is like a freebie. Why not try another?Read Post | Comments (110)Lyle Denniston, 04/05/12Adviser on Constitutional Literacy, National Constitution CenterIn today\u0027s polarized political environment, commentators can get caught up in the partisanship, and assume that government action not to their liking is necessarily driven by political bias. That borders on the silly and, at a minimum, shows a lapse of historical memory.Read Post | Comments (183)Marlo Thomas, 04/05/12Award-winning actress, author, and activistMichael J.
