Swing voters responded to their campaigns based on progressive values they authentically believed in.READ POST | comments12.13.2006 Jonathan TasiniEducation is a cruel lie if it becomes the answer to the challenge of global competition. It\u0027s insulting to workers to feed them the line that they are just too dumb to get a fairly compensated job.READ POST | comments (20)12.13.2006 Ross M. LevineDenial does not allow for debate.
