{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"David CoatesWorrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsThe short-fall in policy proposals is not accidental. It is the product of deep flaws in policy design, themselves reflective of serious misunderstandings about (or mis-specifications of) the causes of poverty and its cures. Those design flaws and misunderstandings are at their greatest on the Republican side. To a significant degree, many Republican lawmakers seem entirely indifferent to the plight of the American poor. Nicholas Kristof has recently written of a serious compassion gap in contemporary America -- a gap touching both left and right, and holding majority sway among Republicans. He is right: and when Republicans in particular do address the plight of the poor, far too often they are content to place the blame for poverty on those actually trapped inside it. Regardless of the regularity with which they are repeated, many of the stereotypes common in Republican poverty-discourse are quite simply false.Comments (11)Robin LakoffProfessor of linguistics emerita, University of California, BerkeleyWe need to understand why a word like \u0027bossy\u0027 exists with its current meaning, and change the world that makes it meaningful and useful.CommentsAnn BrenoffSenior Writer, The Huffington PostI went through the first 35 years of my working life having to look up how to spell \u0027laid off.\u0027 For real. It was just one of those brain twerks; to this day, I never type the words \u0027meditate\u0027 or \u0027environment\u0027 right the first time either. But I sure learned how to spell \u0027laid off.\u0027Comments (62)Tony PosnanskiWriter, \u0027The Anti-Jared\u0027Once question remained: Was I the guy on the Westview track that afternoon? In every picture it was a woman. The time frame of my weight loss story does not fit with the original. I write a lot; that would be very strange if it was about me. Here is my answer.CommentsRob ReinaldaWriter/editor; 28 years in newspapersIn the game of Telephone, by the time the message reaches the last player in the queue, it usually bears little resemblance to the initial utterance. With that in mind, here are some words that many people use frequently -- and incorrectly.Comments (25)David BelkBoard Certified in Internal MedicineIf these medications don\u0027t cost very much, if they don\u0027t cost the insurance companies anything, why the denials? And what does this tell us about the role of health insurance in our lives?Comments (18)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersToday the world celebrates Pope Francis\u0027 first year. Notice I didn\u0027t say the church is celebrating, but the world. His popularity has moved beyond Catholics to Christians of all kinds, believers from other faith traditions, agnostics, and the \"nones,\" who are very drawn to this pope who emphasizes love and simple living.CommentsLisa BloomLegal analyst for NBC News and Avvo.com, attorney and bestselling authorWe\u0027re in the midst of a series of high-profile trials of white Americans who fatally shot unarmed African Americans, which we are constantly told are not about race. Not only is this a losing strategy for the prosecution, but it\u0027s dishonest.CommentsScott DannemillerWriter, blogger, worship leader and former missionary with the Presbyterian ChurchWanna know a secret? We\u0027re all just fighting for something we already have. Like looking for the pen that\u0027s tucked behind my own ear. I scan my page for \"likes\" in hopes of finding a sense of peace. To drown out the voice in my head. My voice.CommentsCamille RiveraExecutive Director, UnitedNYMoskowitz is trying to paint herself as a defender of black and Latino children, but really her war on Mayor Bill de Blasio is not about children or civil rights. It\u0027s about Moskowitz wanting more power, more profit for her 22 schools and demanding to get everything she wants.CommentsScott FettersCopywriter and Facebook marketing consultantI\u0027m obsessed with tracking. I have numerous tools for tracking metrics, hours, and even an activity tracker for my personal life. Oddly enough, I never tracked my daily work routine from waking up to dozing off -- until now. Suitably dubbed, The 6 a.m. Experiment.CommentsDavid LyellSecretary, United Teachers Los Angeles; LAUSD TeacherWhat our schools don\u0027t need is more bureaucracy from outside interests. The children of millionaires and billionaires attend private schools with small class sizes and fully staffed campuses. Why is it that what\u0027s good enough for the children of millionaires and billionaires isn\u0027t good enough for all students?CommentsLindley PlessBlogger, www.lindleypless.comI wanted to hide away in bed until it had all passed, but I had to go on. Thanksgiving needed to be celebrated, family needed to be joined and the girls needed their mom to be their mom. And therein lies the rub.CommentsJoseph A. PalermoProfessor, historian, authorThe oversight institutions charged with protecting the public from CIA abuses have been rendered dysfunctional like so many other parts of the regulatory state.Comments (114)Patricia G. GreeneNational Academic Director, Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small BusinessesDon\u0027t accept that you have to \"play the game\" in a way that doesn\u0027t fit your values. It\u0027s not necessary easy, but its way easier for those of us in the U.S. than the students at a school in Bangladesh who asked me if they really had to pay all those expected bribes when they were starting their businesses.CommentsNaomi CampbellModel, Actor, Activist, Mentor and Executive Producer of The FaceWhen going nude in any setting I think most of us initially worry about being judged and feeling vulnerable in that there is no place to hide our insecurities - they are totally exposed for everyone to see.CommentsAlon Ben-MeirSenior Fellow, NYU\u0027s Center for Global AffairsIt is not enough for the Arab states to provide Kerry with lukewarm public support; they need to become active participants both publicly and privately and show solidarity with the US-led efforts to send a clear message to the Israeli and Palestinian publics where they really stand.CommentsKellie GerardiCommercial Spaceflight Advocate, Explorers Club Member and Aspiring MartianPeople tend to get hung up on a small detail of this seriously cool mission. Here\u0027s the catch: it\u0027s a one way trip.Comments (14)Heather WhiteFilmmaker and Network Fellow, Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics Harvard UniversityBenzene poisoning is not the fault of any one global electronic brand. It is the human cost of electronic sweatshops where profit is prioritized above safety.CommentsRachel M. MartinWriter, Findingjoy.netThere is no supermom. There is only the real mom. And the real mom is brave, tenacious, funny, crazy, excited, tired, giving, crying, hoping, loving, challenging, working, worn out, loving life, loving those kids, and amazing.Comments (17)Deborah J. VaginsSenior Legislative Counsel on civil rights issues for the ACLUHarassment is still far too common in the American workplace. According to a national poll, a quarter of all female workers and 10 percent of men have experienced some form of sexual harassment at work. By limiting the definition of supervisor, the Vance decision seriously limited the power to fight harassment.CommentsNick TurseManaging Editor, TomDispatch.comSince 9/11, the U.S. military has been making inroads in Africa, building alliances, facilities, and a sophisticated logistics network. Despite repeated assurances by U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) that military activities on the continent were minuscule, a 2013 investigation by TomDispatch exposed surprisingly large and expanding U.S. operations.CommentsStephanie MadsenThree-time cancer survivor, motivational speaker and bloggerDear Cancer: I\u0027m breaking up with you. There are no negotiations that can be made. No argument strong enough, no comeback able to change my mind. This is the end. I\u0027m over you. To be honest, I never liked you in the first place.CommentsBonnie St. JohnOlympic Ski Medalist, Amputee, Rhodes Scholar, former White House Official, Corporate Leadership Expert, and Best-Selling AuthorIn a world of endless chores and challenges, your absolute best work should be targeted on the most significant and important elements of your life... not on every little thing competing for your energy.CommentsRobert L. BorosagePresident, Institute for America\u0027s FutureAmid the numbers, budgets display our values, what we consider important, what we consider fair, how we address our future. Taken together, the blizzard of numbers provides a pointillist portrait of the society we would build.Comments (27)Chris WeigantPolitical writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comAmericans are now being tracked as they\u0027ve never been tracked before. What is normal and accepted these days sounds like a tinfoil-hatted paranoiac\u0027s delusion from just a few decades ago, in fact.Comments (12)Cynthia Germanotta and Marc Brackett, Ph.D.First and foremost, we are an organization that conducts our charitable activity directly, and we fund our own work. We are not a grant-maker that funds the work of other charities, and were never intended to be.CommentsLord Weidenfeld of ChelseaFounder and chairman of Weidenfeld \u0026 NicolsonMuch as his rhetoric and his will power in domestic policy is being recognized, he is generally been seen as lacking the talent to positively distinguish and assert himself in foreign policy.Comments (22)Bernard-Henri LévyFrench philosopher and writerOn the subject of the Ukrainian crisis and the possible kidnapping of Crimea by the Russian Federation, we have been hearing two very strange arguments that are in urgent need of rebuttal.Comments (24)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkNo longer can we ignore the reality that our children are dying. No longer can we close our eyes to the immense pain and suffering of these grieving parents, siblings and loved ones. No longer can we act as if this doesn\u0027t impact us.Comments (32)Jamie KrugWriter, SAHM, CMO - Chief Medical Officer (of my family), Wife, Blogger at OurStrokeOfLuck.netI should have been happy, sweetly satisfied that day, at that moment. It should have felt like a celebration -- something to look forward to. If only I could stop myself from looking back, from feeling those feelings from that exact day four years earlier washing over me at random intervals.CommentsCharlotte Robinson, 2014.13.03Richard J.
