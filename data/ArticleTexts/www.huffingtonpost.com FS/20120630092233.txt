{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Physician, Author, Senior Lecturer, Harvard Medical SchoolThe Supreme Court\u0027s decision to uphold Obamacare puts me in mind of the old proverb: Be careful what you wish for. Democrats on a victory lap should watch their step, because John Roberts may have given Mitt Romney a gift. The impact on the health system will be much smaller than the political fallout, because with or without Obamacare, the American health system will continue to unravel -- quickly if Romney is elected, slowly if Obama is re-elected. The Democrats would have been better off if the Court had overturned the law, and I think it would have been better for our health system, as well. The base would be energized, and Democrats would take the offensive. More important, no one would be under the illusion that the health system has been successfully reformed, as many good liberals now are.Read Post | Comments (1,454)Howard Schultz, 06/29/12CEO of Starbucks Coffee CompanyJoin the national conversation with #INDIVISIBLE.

In fact, it hasn\u0027t been since 1966.
