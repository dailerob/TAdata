{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, the framework of a deal on curbing Iran\u0027s nuclear capabilities was announced. Existing stockpiles of enriched uranium will be reduced by 97 percent, centrifuges by two-thirds, along with what President Obama called a \"robust and intrusive\" inspection regime -- if adhered to, the deal would make a bomb impossible for at least 10 years. \"It will make our country, our allies and our world safer,\" said Obama. In short, a tentative victory for all. Except, of course, those cheerleaders of the disastrous Iraq War pining to launch a sequel. Speaker Boehner vowed to ask \"tough questions\" -- something Congress failed to do 12 years ago in the run up to Shock and Awe. And Sen. Mark Kirk has already trotted out the Iraq playbook, predicting this is \"going to end with a mushroom cloud somewhere near Tehran.\" But at least this time around we have a much clearer picture of what listening to cynical references to mushroom clouds can lead to.The deal recently concluded between Iran and the so-called \"P-5 plus 1\" nations is designed to prevent Iran from being able to rapidly acquire fissile material in quantities suitable for use in a nuclear weapon. As negotiated, it is a far cry from the kind of irresponsible capitulation critics of the negotiations charge.Author, \u0027Dangerous Ground\u0027In the wake of the financial crisis, President Obama took the helm of a sinking economic ship and help to right it. The unemployment rate is now once again at pre-recession levels -- the lowest in seven years (5.5%).Singer; Actress; Director; Composer; ActivistWrite a letter today to someone you love that can be kept, savored, and passed along to family members when the time is right.

I don\u0027t think that\u0027s possible with an email.Actor, author of 10 books and a book of poems \"Life Could Be Verse” published by HCI, December 2014Gregg Jacobs is an insomnia specialist at the Sleep Disorders Center at the UMass Memorial Medical Center and the author of Say Good Night to Insomnia. In answer to my questions, he shared his insights on how human sleep patterns have changed over time, healthier and more effective alternatives to sleeping pills, and how to reverse our worst sleep habits and behaviors.SB 101 is based on hate; no matter how Governor Pence tries to sell it, he is teaching discrimination, he is enshrining inequality into Indiana law, and he is justifying segregation under a false flag in which liberty would have no part.Chair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusCo-founder and Board President, Harvey Milk Foundation; nephew of Harvey MilkApril Fools\u0027 Day, which also marks the kick-off of National Distracted Driving Awareness Month.

But there\u0027s so much more to do. Don\u0027t think our opponents aren\u0027t already regrouping and calibrating their next attack, moving on to other states. We cannot fool ourselves, dazzled by the events, into thinking that because we won a media battle, we have won the war.Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesWhat it comes down to is that black girls are missing representations of themselves in positive contexts. When they turn on the TV, they are missing. When they are looking at the cover of magazines like Vogue and Elle, they are missing.Author, blogger, and poet.This deal will verifiably prevent Iran from building a bomb for at least 15 years. No American troops will be killed, and it won\u0027t cost us a dime. What\u0027s not to like?President, Ploughshares Fund; Author, \u0027Nuclear Nightmares: Securing the World Before It Is Too Late\u0027I am neither powerful nor chic. I\u0027m just another working schlub. The dress is easy. I can throw it on and be ready in under five minutes. That frees my time for other stuff: reading the news, checking email, hanging out with my kids. I don\u0027t get caught up in the drama of figuring out what to wear.Managing Editor, HuffPost BusinessClearly, the struggle to create a nation and world of economic and social justice and environmental sanity is not an easy one. But this I know: Despair is not an option if we care about our kids and grandchildren. Giving up is not an option if we want to prevent irreparable harm to our planet. We must stand up and fight back.Independent U.S. Senator from VermontIt\u0027s been 31 days since the release of the White House Task Force on 21st Century Policing report, but the number of fatal police encounters is already over 100 and counting. That\u0027s an average of more than three people killed each day in March by police in America.Legislative Counsel, ACLU Washington Legislative OfficeIt is encouraging that CEOs have taken an active role in the Indiana debate. But they can\u0027t do it alone. Leaders from all walks of life, from government officials to civic leaders, need to embrace diversity in all forms. Speaking publicly against discrimination is the first step in that process.Professor of Management Practice, Harvard Business SchoolGosh, I\u0027m pleased and flattered that our music is now in the Library of Congress, but it also feels a little weird because we were on Nixon\u0027s hit list along with Jane Fonda, Tom Hayden, and other \"radicals.\" Now, we\u0027re \"cool?\"Founding member of The DoorsIt\u0027s a huge misgiving to solely place blame on \"suicidal tendencies\" during horrendous events like the Germanwings crash, because it conflates suicide with the intention to hurt other people.Healthy Living Editor, The Huffington PostUnlike other components of comprehensive immigration, such as high-skilled reform, which could not pass as stand-alone bills given the vexing politics of the issue, recapturing unused green cards would not dim the prospects of a larger immigration overhaul.Currently at Revolution LLC; previously the White House, Huffington Post Media Group, and Obama for AmericaThe time has come for the international community to end torture as a cheap form of investigative tool by the authorities -- and it is possible. In the words of the historical Rabbi Hillel: \"If not now, when?\"Founder, International Bridges to JusticeThe threats emanating from Yemen are distorted and exaggerated, the stakes are actually relatively low (except for Yemenis), any imposed settlement is highly elusive and the costs to those engaged may be high. For the U.S., it can be once again something of a lose-lose situation where the enemy of my enemy is often also my enemy.Former vice chairman, CIA’s National Intelligence CouncilCorporate interests that spend hundreds of millions a year on state and federal lobbying have grown accustomed to getting what they want at the federal and state levels, but it is much harder to assert corporate control over America\u0027s 22,553 municipal and county governments.The Center for Media and Democracy/ALEC ExposedThe Presidential Task Force on Combating Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) Fishing and Seafood Fraud needs to put the words of the final plan into action.

We had been so in love, so happy, and rarely ever fought. And then slowly it changed.Health Coach, Yoga Teacher, Author of Detox 101 and founder of The Flourish Series at JessiAndricks.comReligious liberty is critically important and, yes, threatened. But the Indiana law was different from the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993. And the strong public reaction against it also comes from people who believe in the protection of religious liberty, but not in ways that use it to condone discrimination in the public sphere against anyone.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersMany children eagerly look forward to the end of the school year and the carefree days of summer, playing outside in the warm sun, splashing and swimming in pools and at beaches, and gathering with family and friends for backyard barbeques. But for more than 17 million children the end of school can be the end of certainty about where and when their next meal will come.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundConsider the rise of both the working poor and the non-working rich, and the meritocratic ideal on which America\u0027s growing inequality is often justified doesn\u0027t hold up.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027May our friends and colleagues at Garrissa find their way back to education as they deal with the deep trauma and grief of these recent days. In Kenya, there will be some measure of defiance when students, teachers and staff resume their educational project. Our thoughts and prayers are with them.President, Wesleyan UniversityIt comes down to this: A man found the shape of a woman\u0027s body unacceptable so she was publicly humiliated. This is not a new concept to our society. Looking like that, she was asking for it... Sound like a familiar phrase, anyone?Stand up comedian and writerI am a 27-year-old Jew living in Pakistan. It\u0027s a statement that has elicited shock, warnings, threats and intense curiosity ever since I moved from Morocco to Karachi, the country\u0027s largest city in the homeland of my parents.Humble yet loudmouth micro blogger who doesn\u0027t shy away to be politically incorrect.Interested in geopolitics,society \u0026 culture of PakistanBy allowing the pursuit of money to guide our educational practices, we have miseducated everyone.
