{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Hillary Clinton is sinking like a stone. She\u0027s falling in the polls. Conversations with her longtime friends and admirers indicate grave worry. She is not generating the excitement that the first prospective woman president should; the email mess is not going away; even the money advantage is not what was anticipated. And a self-declared socialist could defeat her in Iowa and New Hampshire. Even as she tacks left to excite the base, there is no way she can out-Sanders Sanders. If she could just vault over the rest of the pack and claim the nomination, as she hoped when she declared her candidacy, Hillary Clinton might still be a strong nominee. But that\u0027s not going to happen.\"We\u0027re going to push and push until some larger force makes us stop.\" David Addington, the legal adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney, made that declaration to Jack Goldsmith of the Office of Legal Counsel in the months after September 11, 2001.Professor of Literature, Yale UniversityThe most tragic consequence of Congress killing the deal would be that it would eliminate the prospect for greater U.S.-Iran cooperation in the region on areas of mutual concern. It would lock in continued enmity between the United States and Iran, serving only to exacerbate tension and conflict across the Middle East. To go down this path when such a mutually advantageous alternative exists would truly be a blunder of historic proportions.Head of Foreign Relations Committee of Iran’s National Security Council (1997-2005)What the corporate media cannot see is that the era of the Bill Clinton \"New Democrat\" is finished. In the real world, the crash of 2008 blew the lid off the bipartisan \"Washington consensus\" with its blind faith in the benevolence of capitalism. But now I see a silver lining in the absurdity of the \"permanent campaign\": Bernie Sanders has a whole year to build a vibrant, multifaceted social movement.Professor, historian, authorPresident Obama is cerebral and deliberative. Not bold and reckless like George W. Bush. That\u0027s why Obama got elected in the first place. I call it the law of the missing imperative: The party out of office has to find out what voters want that they are not getting from the incumbent.Professor, George Mason University; contributor, Al JazeeraWhile middle-class white gays and lesbians picketed the White House wearing suits and skirts, trans women of color threw their heels at police officers and taunted the cops by forming kick-lines and singing raunchy songs. While assimilation-oriented gays pleaded with the queer community for peace in Greenwich Village, enraged queers used parking meters as battering rams to break down the door of the Stonewall Inn and reclaim their safe space from the mob and the police.Rhodes Scholar, researcher, writer, explorerIn life, I try to strike a balance between transparency and over-sharing. Motherhood is a blessing and a joy but it\u0027s messy and scary, too. Life is messy and scary.Award winning writer, speaker, humorist, mom, wine snobShrum vs. Lowry: As billionaires \"bid\" for President and key swing states disenfranchise millions of minorities and millennials, can the process of Democracy grab more attention than Trump\u0027s Hair and Wall? Then: does Donald vs. Jeb \u003d insults vs. results?Host, \u0027Both Sides Now\u0027The security situation in Turkey has started to resemble what is happening in Arab nations, whose capitals and ancient cities are frequently rocked by bombs but also confused politics.Columnist and Senior Diplomatic Correspondent, Al HayatAs the country continues to deal with racial strife, fatal police encounters, and dogged economic inequality, the Watts protests has instructional value for advocates of racial justice and their adversaries. For the former, short-term improvements can prove to be fruitful and can be an important respite from the daily onslaught of racial oppression.Postdoctoral ResearcherThe Republicans complain about Obama not doing enough to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear bomb, nor enough to blunt Iran\u0027s increasing regional influence in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen, yet one of their own -- George W. Bush -- had a big hand in aggravating these problems in the first place.Senior Fellow and Director of the Center on Peace \u0026 Liberty, The Independent InstituteBusiness isn\u0027t simple; foreign policy isn\u0027t either. If Trump wants to be taken seriously by the general electorate, he should demonstrate the nuanced understanding of foreign policy exemplified by candidates ranging from Jeb Bush to Hillary Clinton.Columnist, 3L at Harvard LawI wonder about your response because I know myself. I know by experience how close I can walk myself to disaster while whispering the word \"harmless\" under my breath. How many of us live this way?Author of \u0027Wild in the Hollow\u0027 and writer and blogger at AmberCHaines.com.When sport is driven by the soul instead of the ego, it can be good, very good. Besides forging lifelong bonds between family members and friends, there are many other reasons -- egoless reasons -- why we\u0027re drawn to sports. Consider just a few:Author, How We Can Save Sports: A Game PlanSweetcakes by Melissa does have options. They can commit civil disobedience and discriminate: Refusing to bake a wedding cake for some people but not others is just that. We have a well-established history of civil disobedience in this country. Engaging in such actions, however, also has consequences. Choosing that path means accepting that risk, including facing lawsuits and fines.Trump\u0027s call for a wall to protect U.S. borders from marauding Mexican criminals not only demonizes Latinos, but evokes toxic themes of Manifest Destiny that were used to justify American expansionism into Mexico. Themes that allowed white folk -- the U.S.\u0027 original \"anchor babies\" -- to be legitimized as citizens.Author of Moral Combat: Black Atheists, Gender Politics and the Values Wars and a visiting scholar at USC’s Center for Feminist ResearchIt\u0027s hard in the midst of fighting for civil rights, in fighting for equality, to measure progress. But it is clear that we are making progress, however slow and painful it may be.Author, The Human Agenda: Conversations about Sexual Orientation \u0026 Gender Identity and The Talk Show, A NovelClearly, we are finding it difficult to take time off work. But when we do, emerging research in the field of occupational psychology is here to help us make the most of it. Here are a few ways to maximize your happiness during vacation and reap the benefits long after you\u0027re back to reality.Mind-Body Expert, Resident Neuroscientist at HeadspaceChildren of color need to be able to see themselves in the books they read. Just as importantly, all children need to be exposed to a wide range of books that reflect the true diversity of our nation and world as they really are.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundJulian Bond was courageous and visionary, a steady hand and a thoughtful strategist, and a tireless and eloquent voice for justice for all who were denied their rights. But for me, Julian was more. He was a mentor who taught me a lesson that has guided my work ever since.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Bottom line is that we simply don\u0027t know the future, and bureaucratic and highly regulated education systems are inherently inapt to respond to imminent learning opportunities and other emerging circumstances connected to the digital age.Journalism/English teacherIn January 1983 I was one of 163 members sworn in to the Missouri House. How I was treated then had a lot to do with how I looked. It took a while, but I would overcome the \"ditzy blonde\" stereotype as the only female lawyer, though not the only woman, in the state house.U.S. Senator from MissouriSince Democrats raced to distance themselves from Carter with almost as much vigor as Republican embraced him, the Carter failure meme has gone unchallenged for 35 years. With Carter\u0027s announcement that he is fighting advanced cancer, maybe it is time to set the record straight.Host, Cyber Law and Business Report; political columnist; internet lawyerThis past week, we lost one of America\u0027s most beloved and irreplaceable treasures: Julian Bond. While we mourn his passing and think of his countless contributions to society, I cannot help but wonder who in this generation -- or in my generation -- is going to, at the very least, ask for the baton.Executive Director of the Making A Way Foundation, Inc.I know being happy, contented, and present myself will be the best thing for my children, but how do I get there? I have to resist the urge to do. I have to stop cleaning, scrolling, planning, thinking-- and tune back into my center, into being.Wife, mom, special education teacher, recovering perfectionist, dark chocolate addict, blogger at zachellamom.com/wp.Kim is far more qualified to be president than Trump. She is way more famous. Her reality TV show was far better than Trump\u0027s. And Kim has 35 million followers on Twitter compared to Trump\u0027s paltry four million followers. It\u0027s not even close.The InterpreterSleep doctors toss and turn sometimes -- but it\u0027s never for long. That\u0027s because they use scientifically-sound methods to lull themselves into dreamland. Steal their techniques so you can finally get a good night\u0027s rest.Your ultimate guide to fitness, health, weight loss, nutrition, sex, style and guy wisdomYes, there is more to dating and mating and enjoying a relationship than physical attraction, so no need to point that out. And yes, these bits of advice apply to both women and men. And yes, who am I to be giving advice about what people look like. OK... But we all respond initially to appearance, so a few basics are worth keeping in mind.Journalist/ProducerHaving no idea what to do next hurts, even as it might excite us on some level. Whether graduating from college or retiring from a long career, the road ahead may appear to be devoid of landmarks - intimidating in its blankness, goading because freedom is supposed to be so desirable yet its reality is often heavy with perplexing dilemmas.Medical Social Worker; Author, \u0027 Life Gets Better: The Unexpected Pleasures of Growing Older\u0027We all want to start off on the right foot when starting a new school year. I know cereal and frozen waffles are often a necessity, but here are a few other easy options that will make parents and kids happy.Chef, Recipe Developer and Busy MomI want you to fail because you might have to try 20 activities before you find the one you know you cannot live without.
