{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Executive Director, ACLU (1978-2001, Retired) and President of the Drug Policy Alliance BoardSlavery was America\u0027s original sin; it poisoned the blood and infected the bones of our polity, and that poison remains, still doing its sinful work. If we believe what we were taught in school about America as the land of freedom and equal opportunity, about all of us -- all of us -- being equally endowed with inalienable rights, about the purpose of government, as declared in the Declaration of Independence, being to secure those rights, then we have a lot of work still to do. We remain very far from a post-racial country.We also need to better detect and treat mothers who suffer from depression. We have strong evidence that untreated depression in moms impairs their attachment to their children and is associated with these children developing behavioral and emotional problems in childhood. If the moms are properly treated not only do they do better, so do their kids.Medical director, New York State Office of Mental HealthParticularizing \"rape on campus\" in the search for real and lasting prevention and solutions will not solve the problem of rape on campus. The culture that enables rape is the broader one of male dominance, violence and exploitation.Feminist, writer, and satirist (not always in that order)You see, I felt like bowing down to that belly. I felt like celebrating it and thanking it for what it had carried -- for whom it had carried.Writer, MamaBeanParenting.comFrom 12 to 50 it\u0027s assumed we\u0027re packing, assumed that like the Hulk or zombies we possess superhuman, virtually unstoppable destructive power. So where an average citizen may disagree, even argue and berate a police officer, treating them as the public servant that they indeed are, a black man, if he wishes to continue living, must channel his ancestors.Novelist, Screenwriter, and Associate Professor at Columbia UniversityThrough daily moral consciousness we must all counter the proliferating voices of racial and ethnic and religious division that are regaining too much respectability over the land.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundA native of St Louis, long a New York City expat, I less felt anger than shame at the inevitability of it all. Performers cast in a familiar play with specific roles to play once the curtain went up.Advocate, journalist and lecturerThe democratic chorus in Washington has shifted from one that is broadly in favor of business interests to one virtually devoid of any other voices.WriterWe now all have the chance to examine the evidence -- released last night -- in the grand jury\u0027s decision not to indict white police officer Darren Wilson, who fired multiple bullets into Michael Brown. But the verdict on America\u0027s criminal justice system is already in for many Americans: guilty, for treating young black men differently than young white men.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersI want to offer a special thanks to the technologists of the world -- all those who work anonymously in the world\u0027s labs and engineering departments to come up with the circuits, code, and contraptions that have combined to change life as I know it.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarOne of the prevailing things I noticed on that fateful night was the high volume of teens who were speaking out and explaining why this isn\u0027t just about one of our peers -- it\u0027s a bigger societal indication about civil rights and the racism that still exists in America.18-year-old high school senior in Colorado SpringsIn some places, the police seem, and act, like an occupying force. If the law does not represent you but only governs you, you are a subject, not a citizen. So what are the \"blessings\" that Americans should \"gratefully acknowledge,\" as Abraham Lincoln put it in the 1863 proclamation creating the first national Thanksgiving?Professor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027We are in a state of emergency, a time of challenge and controversy, but not because of the protestors. That state of emergency will continue until we stand, become uncomfortable, and demand a justice system that addresses the manifestation of pain in protest, the further chipping away of respect, and the real state of emergency our country faces.Director of African American Religious Affairs, People For the American Way and People For the American Way FoundationAs we sit around our holiday table, we can celebrate the manifold opportunities to teach our parents, children, grandchildren and guests that it would be a terrible waste of life if all we focused on was our own personal blessings without simultaneously raising to consciousness all that needs \u0027tikkun.\u0027Editor, Tikkun MagazineMany American children won\u0027t have a safe, stable home this holiday season. Homelessness among families with children isn\u0027t an intractable problem; federal rental assistance -- like the Housing Choice Voucher program -- is an effective solution. But funding is seriously inadequate and has faced significant cuts.Senior Policy Analyst, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesThanksgiving is all about giving thanks, and being grateful and kind is not something we should restrict to this time of year. It\u0027s a gift that keeps on giving all year long -- not just for those we interact with, but for ourselves as well.AuthorIt occurred to me that afternoon as I was heading toward a stroke that no amount of facts or evidence was going to change this guy\u0027s mind and that neither of us was going to leave unscathed. I took the easy way out and said, \"I\u0027m sorry, but I\u0027ve stopped arguing with people who are impervious to reality,\" and left it at that.Richard Zombeck is a freelance writer for hire living in the Boston area and hangs out at www.zombeckink.comThis year the day after Thanksgiving will be remembered not as the biggest shopping day of the year but as the day Americans took action to demand that Walmart, the country\u0027s largest employer, pay workers livable wages and play a part in improving our economy.E.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeYou don\u0027t have to feel like an outsider this holiday season. Join the party and live full out. Just make sure you devote more time to your health than you do to your indulgences and then you can start your New Year without any guilt for how you ended this year.National fitness expert, speaker, contributor to Prevention magazine, author of several books and fitness DVDsI don\u0027t think the fate of Darren Wilson as a human being really means anything to the ruling class. At the end of the day, people like Bob McCulloch aren\u0027t protecting Wilson so much as the system that he stood for.Author, \u0027Tear Down This Myth\u0027Even if the federal government declines to prosecute Wilson, it is highly probable that the Justice Department under a 1994 federal law will take the Ferguson police department to federal court itself. Once there, upon a showing of a pattern of civil rights violations, they can force reforms under consent decrees with federal monitors.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityUnplug, shut down, get together with friends and family face to face, and be thankful for this crazy life. That\u0027s what the holidays are about -- celebrating life and those close to us who put the color in it.Party Stylist at Evitehusband, father, photographer, writer, producer and director kenhammphoto.comWhen it comes to Thanksgiving, librarians enjoy pumpkin pie and the Thanksgiving Day Parade as much as the next person. But it should come as no surprise that for the librarians at The New York Public Library, one of the things they\u0027re most thankful for are books.Creating the library for the futureI can\u0027t speak. My country has scarred me once again. How can I go to work in the morning on a train full of people who care not? At a workplace of people who missed the story because of football or reality television?University Chaplain, University of PennsylvaniaDouble chocolate pavlova could be the ultimate sweet ending to your feast. No one will miss the pumpkin pie.Once Upon a ChefAs education becomes dematerialized, demonetized and democratized, every man, woman and child on the planet will be able to reap the benefits of knowledge. We\u0027re rapidly heading toward a world of education abundance.Chairman/CEO, XPRIZECooking is one of my favorite pastimes, but cooking a big meal without a plan can take time away from family and friends and add stress to the season. Most of us would rather watch the Bears play the Lions from the couch, not from the kitchen. With that in mind, here are a few tips for removing stress from Thanksgiving and adding more time to focus on family.Former WNBA MVP, four-time Olympic Gold MedalistThanksgiving is a lifestyle that you can cultivate every single day of your life. Gratitude has been the key to every success and every victory in my life.
