{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranThere is something for Democrats to pay attention to, here. For years, many Democrats were skittish about going too hard after the decision to go to war in Iraq, or use it as a basis to oppose further military intervention in the region. They saw folks being tarred as \"defeatist\" or \"Neville Chamberlain\" or worse. Even recently, a lot of Democrats were afraid to oppose the idea of getting deeply involved in the Syrian civil war, lest they get tagged as weak on national security. To them and to the eventual nominees up and down the Democratic ballot, it couldn\u0027t be clearer -- the position of those opposed to the Cheney/Bush view of America\u0027s role in the world, is the prevailing opinion of voters in both parties.It was bound to happen again. The real surprise is that it took this long. Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders are not accidents coughed up by history. They\u0027re the foreseeable products of a flawed political reform instituted a half century ago.Interim director of the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public PolicyKalamazoo is a vibrant, cool city with a creative community, a promise of college to our youth, and neighbors who support one another. Kalamazoo is not -- and will never be -- synonymous with senseless violence.Writer and lifelong resident of Kalamazoo, Michigan.The establishment doesn\u0027t see what\u0027s happening because it has cut itself off from the lives of most Americans. It also doesn\u0027t wish to understand, because that would mean acknowledging its role in bringing all this on. Yet regardless of the political fates of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, the rebellion against the establishment will continue.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027In the week before Valentine\u0027s Day, United Technologies expressed its love for its devoted Indiana employees, workers whose labor had kept the corporation profitable, by informing 2,100 of them at two facilities that it was shipping their factories, their jobs, their communities\u0027 resources to Mexico.International President, United SteelworkersThe Christian context that is often associated with black prophetic traditions has proven to be a key fault-line within the networks of #blacklivesmatter.Columbia U. Professor, Religion \u0026 African-American Studies, Author of Spirit in the Dark (July 2016)A Wall Street CEO took to the pages of the Wall Street Journal to decry the fact that, \"Millennials are flocking to Sanders.\" It would be cruel to note that one has to be clueless to believe that writing an op-ed in the WSJ was a good way to reach millennials supporting Bernie.Prof; Econ \u0026 Law, UMKC. Financial regulator. White-collar criminologist. Founding member, Bank Whistleblowers United. Author: The Best Way to Rob a Bank is to Own One.The cure for grief is not \"be not sad\" and the cure for anger isn\u0027t \"be unangry!\" It\u0027s feeling all of the things, even the uncomfortable ones, without judging yourself for them. Your job, when bad shit happens, is to get through it however you can. It is not your job to make your life more palatable for other people.Founder, Still Kickin; Author, \u0027It’s Okay To Laugh (Crying’s Cool Too)\u0027In a day marked by spirited political disagreement, everyone involved came together to agree on one thing: this was not what democracy was supposed to look like.Editor in Chief, AMERICAblogNegative portrayals of Muslims in media not only fan the flames of Islamophobia, but they also reinforce feelings of alienation and humiliation in Muslims -- exactly the sentiments that motivate people to join ISIS and other extremist groups.Cultural Diplomacy Expert; Fmr. U.S. Ambassador to NetherlandsThe talking heads and wonks of Washington had kicked the can down the road long enough and now was the time to toss caution to the wind and throw the whole thing under the bus.Author of three bestsellers on former U.S. president Ronald ReaganThe Kalamazoo shootings are being called random. After 42 mass shootings, \"random\" is not exactly accurate. There is a common denominator, and that is guns.Professor of Theology, Chicago Theological SeminaryThe false debate surrounding torture\u0027s use and effectiveness has resurfaced in the United States. In light of the renewed attention, every public figure--and indeed, every American--should know the facts about torture.Executive Director, The Center for Victims of TortureInstead of -- or in addition to -- ordering Apple to build a technological back door to its phones, why aren\u0027t we ordering weapons makers to put technology in their products that can be used by law enforcement to protect us from gun violence?Civil rights lawyer; former state senator, writerRepublicans have a problem. After South Carolina, Donald Trump is in the driver\u0027s seat. He may well remain there unless Rubio and Cruz decide to play as teammates rather than as adversaries.Professor of Political Science at Jacksonville State UniversityFollowing Donald Trump\u0027s crushing victory in the New Hampshire primary, a viral video of him calling fellow candidate Ted Cruz a \"pussy\" grows even more important.Founder, Human Rights Action CenterA Muslim American spied on by the NSA should never feel welcomed in an overwhelmingly white state of Vermont. However, the truth is that Vermont has been nothing but accepting and welcoming to my family and me. How and why is that?lawyer and political activist.Today is a special day in Dutch political history: it is the birthday of the Party for Freedom (PVV), a party known mostly for its \"firebrand\" leader, Geert Wilders.Associate Professor in the School of Public and International Affairs at the University of GeorgiaAmericans are struggling to draw into focus their exalted image of themselves and reality. They are not doing a very good job of it.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghIf you\u0027re like me, you were baffled at first by Donald Trump\u0027s success in his presidential bid, but I think it get it now: He\u0027s a bully in a room full of nerds.Author of \u0027postChristian,\u0027 host of \u0027Homebrewed CultureCast\u0027If we can\u0027t control our bodies and health, we can\u0027t control our lives or our futures. No other presidential contender?--?in this race or in our nation\u0027s history -- has shown such a strong commitment to women\u0027s health and rights as Hillary Clinton has.Activist, student, first time Democratic voter.Remarkably, there is accidental convergence of an anti-Wall Street populist on the Republican side, and an anti-Wall Street populist on the Democratic side. This did not have to happen. Both are tapping the same, legitimate voter rage. But here the symmetry ends.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027After fighting the longest war in its history, the United States stands at the brink of defeat in Afghanistan. How can this be possible?Professor of History at the University of Wisconsin-MadisonMy parents and many of their friends attended these rallies or have spoken up in support of Liang. They have stayed silent and very far away from any Black Lives Matter protests, but they find the time to pay attention and show up when it is a member of their community.Journalist and educatorSanders has a theme, an anthem, a crusade; Clinton has a bunch of bullets. They\u0027re good bullets -- it\u0027s my to-do list, too.

How did it lose its own local government control to a state appointed czar? The steep decline of America\u0027s industrial cities like Flint over the past twenty years was driven by earlier wrong-headed federal government policy actions that badly wounded our country.Bernie Sanders called for letting only 10,000 to enter the United States. That is isn\u0027t just a humanitarian issue; it\u0027s bad foreign policy. When our friends in the international community are asking us for help, it\u0027s all but ignoring their pleas.PhD Candidate in Political Science at Brown UniversityRemember, you were once an infant who could surrender to slumber without much of a fuss, short of colic, a dirty diaper or unmet hunger. But today, as an adult, do you find yourself struggling for something once so simple and now so elusive?The Sleep Ambassador® and Director, CIRCADIAN® Corporate Sleep Programs™: Sleep expert, consultant, author, professor and public speakerPeople are already interested in reading about and watching celebrities.
