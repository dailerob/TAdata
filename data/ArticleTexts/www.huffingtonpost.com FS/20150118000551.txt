{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Children\u0027s Defense FundAmericans across the country now celebrate Dr. King’s birthday as “a day on, not a day off” and use this day to come together for community service and action­. But we shouldn’t wait for the holiday to come back around to remember and honor him this way. We can honor Dr. King’s legacy best by serving every day and standing together to build a movement to realize Dr. King’s dream and America’s dream and by following his lead in being a drum major for justice. As our country faces morally and economically indefensible child poverty rates, wealth and income inequality, and grandstanding politicians who put party and politics ahead of principle and sound policy, I hope they will hear and follow our great 20th century prophet.It is very important to remember that fundamentalism in all our faith traditions -- Muslim, Christian, and Jewish -- will be far more effectively defeated from the inside than from the outside.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersEven if the country would eventually get to national recognition of marriage equality through the democratic process -- and that is a big \"if\" -- the Court is doing its duty by stepping in now.Chief Counsel, Constitutional Accountability CenterUnlike those of the other possible candidates of the GOP establishment, Jeb Bush and Chris Christie, Romney\u0027s positions on gays have been more defined and extreme -- and more consistent and reiterated much more recently, especially since he veered far right in the primaries in 2012. Any change will be seen as a yet another major flip-flop.Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesThe recent attacks in Paris were gruesome and tragic, but what\u0027s been said and done in the aftermath is enough to make one want to bury their head in the sand and hope to never resurface. Where to begin?Host/Producer, HuffPost LiveThe simple truth is that murderers and presidents, and governments and groups may use the evocative power of religious language to justify their behavior. The problem is not in the language or the religion. The problem is with those who abuse it for their evil ends.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Is it too much to ask Jenny McCarthy to read a simple, well-researched article and properly educate herself about how no legitimate scientific studies have linked vaccines to autism? And then, to announce to the world she was wrong? It would help undo at least some of the damage she\u0027s done to public health and our country\u0027s children.Activist and political blogger at LatestOutrage.orgThis is what they choose to prioritize in the first week. No matter what kind of plans or \"autopsies\" or happy talk comes out of this winter retreat, one thing\u0027s clear: the GOP\u0027s priorities are more outrageous than ever.Communications Director, EMILY\u0027s ListAccording to a Blacademy spokesperson, \"It\u0027s not that white actors weren\u0027t good enough ... It\u0027s just that there were a lot of great performances by black actors this year. In fact, some very good black actors weren\u0027t even nominated. That\u0027s how you know it\u0027s not a race issue.\"Novelist, Screenwriter, and Associate Professor at Columbia UniversityWriter and filmmakerWhile the intent of \u0027Yes Means Yes\u0027 is admirable -- and certainly more communication about and around sex is not a bad thing -- government seeking to regulate sex, or any other act, on such a micro level is a symptom of a culture marked by extreme over-parenting -- and it is dangerously enabling.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarThe fact is all of us depend on healthy natural systems for our prosperity, our progress, our very existence. The state of those systems is imperiled. We need our political leaders in Washington to help create a more promising future for our children, not put it at greater risk.President, NRDCIt\u0027s not enough to keep telling non-Muslims, \"Don\u0027t judge us by those few creeps.\" Muslims have to turn now and address those few creeps, those false guardians of the faith, with one simple declaration: You are not Muslims.Afghan-American authorStatutes that distinguish between messages about different things and treat them differently are indeed content-based restrictions on speech, and the Court must clarify this in order to ensure that all speakers receive the full protections they are due.Assistant Director at the Institute for JusticeMy son turns 14 today. I\u0027m sure he\u0027s wishing for all sorts of stuff: an Xbox, Beats headphones, maybe even good grades. However, my wish for my son on his 14th birthday is much more fundamental. I wish for him to be able to walk to the grocery store without being harassed or gunned down. I wish for him to live.Founder and managing director, Keating AdvisorsIt seemed like a tall order to be gluten-free and eat convenient, inexpensive, healthy meals at the same time. But it had to be done. If I wanted to spend no more energy thinking about what I\u0027d eat the next day than I spent on thinking about it when I wasn\u0027t gluten-free, I\u0027d have to have a plan.Gluten free lifestyle writer. Author of forthcoming children\u0027s book.I grew up with a stutter. Does this mean I shouldn\u0027t have pursued journalism because I stutter? Does this mean I shouldn\u0027t conduct interviews, speak up in meetings or ask questions when I want more clarification?Associate Editor, Blogs \u0026 CommunityIn his recent words on the issue, Obama is dead right. But having spent the past decade focusing on these issues, I\u0027m not ready to take a \"Birdman\" victory lap through the canyons of midtown Manhattan just yet.Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911If you\u0027re in need of a little winter pick-me-up, this vegetarian soup is just the ticket. You can make it with ingredients you likely have on hand, it\u0027s ready in 30 minutes yet tastes like you spent all day in the kitchen making it, and it\u0027s hearty enough to be a complete meal.Once Upon a ChefThe amazing thing about love and attention and encouragement and grace and success and joy is that these things are infinite. We get a new supply every single morning and so we can give it away all day.Bestselling Author, Carry On, Warrior and Founder of MomasteryWe were young, in love and ready for marriage when we said yes in our early twenties. But that doesn\u0027t necessarily mean we were prepared.Reclaiming meaning in the things that matter most in business, wellness and home. Blogger at JustinRicklefs.com. Husband to Brooke. Daddy to four girls \u0026 one boy. Sales exec. Writer.When I met Jamie Walker in 1990, she was a specialist in mediation and conflict resolution. She worked in this capacity from her home in West Berlin, becoming involved in the peace movement, doing violence-prevention work in the school system, and eventually pioneering efforts in mediating cross-border family conflicts.Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogCould you be dating a narcissist and not even know it?A community of experts, bloggers and \"divorced moms\"The GOP and its allies on the far right have been engaged in a prolonged campaign of hysteria-mongering designed to convince the American people that Social Security\u0027s disability insurance program is riddled with fraud.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourThe numbers are in. 2014 was the hottest year on Earth ever recorded (records go back to 1888). December finished it off as the hottest month ever. 6 of the months last year, in fact, hold that record. The last time a \u0027coldest month ever\u0027 was recorded, was 1916. Things are heating up.Author, \u0027How Risky Is It, Really?\u0027These elaborate illegal acts over many years show a deliberate willingness by Credit Suisse AG officials to knowingly engage in profitable activities that defrauded the U.S. Treasury and burdened honest taxpayers. But the Credit Suisse story does not end there.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorEven though we saw the rise of creatively displayed alternative wedding desserts like doughnuts, cake push-pops and good ol\u0027 fashion milk and cookies, the wedding cake proved it\u0027s staying power.The go-to guide for all things weddingsHappy couples don\u0027t shy away. They listen, they argue, they talk, they solve. They fight clean, but they don\u0027t hold back their truth.Founder and Head Coach of Blush, an online life coaching company for girls (www.joinblush.com)With today\u0027s SCOTUS announcement we are entering what we hope will be the last phase of a journey toward greater dignity and equality for lesbian, gay, and bisexual people that started decades ago and has accelerated at a truly astounding rate over the last year and a half. A win before the high court would be a watershed moment for the LGBT-rights movement.Director of the ACLU Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender \u0026 AIDS ProjectI\u0027m 22, I\u0027ve never consumed a legal drink and I never plan to, for better and worse. Being in recovery at any age elicits both challenges and rewards, but being young and at a pivotal, sometimes confusing point in life even without worrying about sobriety makes said challenges and rewards even more prominent.Journalist, blogger, rugby player and college student, while maintaining sobriety.In the quest to help employees attain \"work-life balance,\" efforts often focus only on one half of that equation (life), ignoring the other half (work). Certainly it is worthwhile to create flexible work arrangements and ways for employees to carve out time away from work -- something the Boston Consulting Group has done for years.Global People Team Chair of The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and a Chicago-based senior partnerWhen I travel alone, what I learn about is myself. I learn about my own strengths, and I learn about my own weaknesses and insecurities. I\u0027ve never come home from a trip feeling anything less than a better, stronger person.Founder, Riskology.coGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"ROMNEY REBOOT: HE\u0027S ALL ABOUT THE POOR NOW!",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
