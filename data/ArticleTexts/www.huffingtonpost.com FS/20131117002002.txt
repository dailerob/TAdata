{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Kathleen ReardonProfessor, USC Marshall School; Author, \u0027The Secret Handshake\u0027 and \u0027Shadow Campus\u0027If you are young, old or somewhere in-between, life is full of sharp curves. My father used to say, \"If you have your health, you can do anything.\" He was right. When you don\u0027t have it anymore, you want to be very sure that whoever can help you get back on track is not beyond your financial grasp. Mental, physical or emotional health problems are only a happenstance away. Rather than continuing to tell young people that they\u0027re needed to make the Affordable Care Act work, why not start telling them that their health matters, that denial has never been a cure, that there are lots of risks they\u0027ll take in their youth but not having health insurance is a risk that affects everyone who loves you and every dream you have.Comments (32)Alec BaldwinActorTwo requests. Don\u0027t allow my problem to be MSNBC\u0027s problem. They are good people who work hard at a job, just like many of you. And two, please respect the privacy of my wife and family.

What does the Affordable Care Act do to protect existing plans? If you like your plan, can you keep it, and is that decision up to the policyholder?Comments (23)Anthony W.

Gerry ConnollyMember of Congress representing Virginia\u0027s 11th DistrictIt\u0027s remarkable that even after these explosive revelations about the veracity of the 60 Minutes report, some wish to continue to waste time, energy, and taxpayer dollars to continue this misguided crusade.Comments (51)Clarissa Martinez De CastroDirector, Civic Engagment and Immigration, National Council of La RazaThis lack of political will is pitiful.
