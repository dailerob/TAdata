{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonIn The Social Network, Justin Timberlake\u0027s Sean Parker dazzles Mark Zuckerberg by saying, \"A million dollars isn\u0027t cool. You know what\u0027s cool? A billion dollars.\" Well, you know what else is cool? A billion video views. That\u0027s the milestone that HuffPost Live hit today, just 18 months after it launched. Those billion views have been generated by a broad range of programming, covering everything from the sublime to the silly -- and everything in between. Beyond its growing traffic, HuffPost Live continues to win awards, make news and feature in-depth interviews with guests like Matt Damon, Elizabeth Warren, Bill Gates, Sofia Vergara, Chris Christie and the man with the world\u0027s largest testicles (and just to be clear, that man was not in fact Chris Christie -- two different segments!). So happy 18-month birthday, HuffPost Live -- here\u0027s to the next 1,000,000,000 views!Comments (36)TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"Hamburger grease. Frozen wine. Live worms. These are just some of the materials artist Phil Hansen uses to create his stunning artwork. Find out how limits fuel his creativity and see his unbelievable creations for yourself.CommentsPaul BulckeCEO, NestléExplicit understanding and recognition of the feedback loops between the creation of value for society and value for the business is increasingly well established and will catalyze industry\u0027s innovation and creativity in providing healthy living solutions.CommentsJoseph A. PalermoProfessor, historian, authorIt\u0027s amazing how these people can whine in public about how they\u0027re being mistreated by people who change the sheets at the luxury hotels they stay in. But if you spend your life surrounded with sycophants who constantly tell you how brilliant you are it\u0027s possible to exist inside a bubble inside a bubble inside a bubble.Comments (35)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistThis year, my Valentine (you may have seen me with him -- Irish guy, white hair, blue eyes, adorable) and I will be staying close to home for this most beloved of Hallmark holidays. We\u0027ve been on a tear since before Christmas and we needed to slow down. Besides, the hearth is always good for the heart.CommentsMarian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundHunger and malnutrition have devastating consequences for children. Federal nutrition programs continue to be a critical support to ensure children\u0027s daily nutritional needs are met: they put food on children\u0027s plates, help build healthy minds and bodies, and help lift families out of poverty.CommentsNoah MichelsonExecutive Editor, HuffPost Gay VoicesI don\u0027t want you to walk away from this letter thinking that I\u0027m not targeting your children. I most certainly am. Here are just a few things I want your kids to know.Comments (115)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, Beyond OutrageAmerica has a serious \"We\" problem -- as in \"Why should we pay for them?\" The question is popping up all over the place. It underlies the debate over extending unemployment benefits to the long-term unemployed and providing food stamps to the poor.Comments (83)Bill StiegerWriter from St. Paul, MNWe damn well know the pointlessness of self-pity. But through these recent ordeals we have grown jaundiced about our government and both political parties. Our Congress, with little exception, is solely representative of corporate interests, not people like us.Comments (41)Emily TimbolAuthor of Two Words: Why Hearing, \"I\u0027m Gay\" Changed My Straight, Christian LifeTo stand behind this law is to stand behind discrimination, in Jesus name. And that is something His name should never, ever be used to defend.Comments (138)Richard (RJ) EskowSenior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host, Take Action NewsMake no mistake: The president\u0027s gesture was a good one, and the Harkin/Miller bill is very important. But, as is so often the case nowadays, strategists on the left run the risk of prematurely accepting preconceptions about what is \"politically possible.\"Comments (43)Claire FallonManaging Blog Editor, The Huffington PostWell, here we are. A drippy, chilly, dark February Friday just like any other -- except that we have to watch our coworkers sniff at ponderous towers of roses and baby\u0027s breath that were delivered to their desks throughout the day.CommentsBernard-Henri LévyFrench philosopher and writerCopenhagen. Royal Library of Denmark. The paradox of a monarchy, a real one, scrupulously attached to its etiquette and protocol, as I had the chance to observe at a gala last night at the French embassy, but one that is also, and without any contradiction, one of the most egalitarian societies that I can name.CommentsMJ RosenbergBlogger, Tikkun, Washington SpectatorIt doesn\u0027t matter what legislation AIPAC decides to push in March. The main thing it will be pushing is fear and no small dose of hate. The inevitable fusion of AIPAC and the GOP is approaching.CommentsAnna KunneckeCoach \u0026 writerIf you\u0027re single, breathe a sigh of relief with me. It\u0027s so fantastic to be single on Valentine\u0027s Day! Right? Riiiight??? I hear a lot of silent blinking. Let\u0027s back up, because if you\u0027re single you\u0027re used to wading through an unbelievable amount of psychobabble bullshit.CommentsVivek WadhwaAcademic, Researcher, Writer, EntrepreneurEmployers usually have good intentions and do not deliberately discriminate against women and minorities, but there is a hidden bias that needs to be understood and overcome.CommentsSandi BachomFilmmaker, Author, JournalistI realized we are so limited in our thinking and the universe is so abundant, it\u0027s our fears that block it. When I set out on the streets of New York with my camera, there is that moment of doubt that all artists feel. \"I can\u0027t do this. This time it won\u0027t work. I\u0027m a fraud.\" And then, like learning to play the harmonica, or getting up on skates for the first time, you\u0027re flying, and the hair on the back of your neck stands on end and you lose all track of time. That\u0027s it, for me anyway.CommentsOliver EmbertonEntrepreneur, writer, programmer and artistOne of the best things to do to improve your dating success is not focus on dating. Live awesome first.CommentsJosh HorwitzExecutive Director, Coalition to Stop Gun ViolenceThe opinion of the pro-gun movement seems to be that the guy with the gun is always right, no matter what the facts of the case are; that gun possession makes you a super-citizen with enhanced rights to take life, avoid prosecution, and use lethal force in response to non-lethal force.Comments (553)FoodbeastFood news, all day.It\u0027s that moment when you\u0027re eyeballing a dish on the menu with a name you\u0027re not quite sure how to pronounce.Comments (20)Shannon OliverMiss New York 2012Pretty much anyone on a dating website with a job and basic hygiene can seem worthy of a second date, but take it from me, DON\u0027T DO IT on Valentine\u0027s Day. Do yourself a favor and avoid the awkwardness by pretending you didn\u0027t see their text.CommentsHannah BraimeWriter; Coach; Author, \u0027The Ultimate Guide to Journaling\u0027I\u0027ve been on a quest to replace my \"should\" with alternative vocabulary that is healthier and more accepting -- both of myself and of other people. The longer I\u0027m on this quest, the more I realize the damage the word \"should\" does to our self-relationship and our relationships with others.CommentsAnn BrenoffSenior Writer, The Huffington PostWe are just seven weeks into 2014 and already I am annoyed, verklempt if you will. Here\u0027s a list of the top 7 things pushing me -- and others -- over the top.Comments (53)Scott FettersCopywriter and Facebook marketing consultantDo not fear the NO. It may seem like a powerfully intimidating two letter word. But for such a tiny word, NO is profoundly liberating. When you decide, \"This does not warrant my immediate attention, or this is counterproductive we\u0027re not doing this\" you embrace your intuition.CommentsBob BurnettBerkeley writer, retired Silicon Valley executiveI thought about my path to liberalism when I read the recent interview between President Obama and Bill O\u0027Reilly. O\u0027Reilly mouthed the classic conservative trope: liberals love the \"nanny state\" and think big government can solve all of America\u0027s problems.Comments (92)Robyn ScottSocial entrepreneur, author, co-founder of OneLeapThe word \"giving\" is itself limiting. Ask people how they like to give, or give back. Mostly they\u0027ll talk about donating, sometimes volunteering, occasionally mentoring. Ask people, instead, how they find meaning by helping others, or the planet: their eyes light up and the conversation expands.CommentsJim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027While many may be struggling through aisles of candy hearts and bunches of roses, I invite you to flip this day of mandatory public expressions of love on its head. What if, along with romantic dinners and expensive chocolates, we celebrated those we love by committing ourselves against sexual and domestic violence?CommentsMichelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesCuccinelli, a true believer who was willing to go down with his ugly cause, is surely weeping today, watching the commonwealth sink into what he and his radical right compatriots view as degradation when in fact the state is finally on the path to joining the ranks of those states offering full equality.Comments (16)Laura Weissidealist, job seekerI am one of dozens of cover letters that you will receive today, in your 30k no-benefits full-time plus \"Associate Program/ Program Assistant/ Education Coordinator/ Development Coordinator/ Social Media Associate\" job.CommentsDr. Juli FragaPsychologistOur pain is often our greatest teacher. When we become more intimate with emotionally painful circumstances, we open ourselves up to what these struggles can teach us.CommentsMensenBrooklyn-based muralist, public artist and community facilitator\"Ok, Stupid\" is an ongoing series of drawn self-portraits inspired by self-representation of women in the digital age and online dating as a young, working-class feminist survivor navigating a surveillance/exhibition culture.CommentsMark J.
