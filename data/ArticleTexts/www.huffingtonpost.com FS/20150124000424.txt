{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor-At-Large, HuffPost GreeceThe upcoming elections in Greece are undeniably a global event, whose importance transcends Greece\u0027s borders. The importance lies in the fact that these elections are part of a series of critical elections in Europe, from the British elections in May to Spain\u0027s elections in November. Greece was the very first country within the Eurozone that went through an economic crisis. It was also the first country to receive the EU\u0027s basic recipe for curing the crisis: the recipe of austerity. Thus, Greece is becoming the first country that will reveal the political consequences of this plan through these elections, the results of which are threatening to create a long deflation and constant public dejection within the UN. Looking at these elections from the outside raises one question: Will the Greek reaction to austerity and its consequences, regardless of the elections, create a new round of the European crisis, or will it begin steps towards its resolution?It is too early to tell whether King Salman is capable of, or even is aware of the need for changing course. All one can say with any confidence is that some of the key figures who stage-managed the Kingdom\u0027s disastrous foreign intrigues are now out.Editor, Middle East EyeThe accelerating pace of revolutionary advances in information technology and artificial intelligence are rendering obsolete established protocols for measuring economic growth and regulating economic activity, while exacerbating the vast gulf between the haves and the have-nots.Author and former head of the Signal CorpsFormer member of the Board of Directors, Export-Import Bank of the United StatesThe old saying, \"Success is getting what you want and happiness is wanting what you get\" might well sum up the dilemma of many professional women.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarI thought the State of the Union was one of Obama\u0027s best addresses recently, because he focused on what is real for this country: growing economic inequality where only a few are doing \"spectacularly well\" while many families are still struggling just to get by.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersWe all want what is best for our children, but the truth is that we are all in this together. Vaccines matter. They save lives. And when they are not given, the impact can be devastating and far-reaching.D.C. Mom, Photographer, Kid at HeartAre National Football League referees, in addition to their duties policing a chaotic game of borderline violence, also supposed to serve as grade school hall monitors?BOB KATZ\u0027 most recent book, The Whistleblower: Rooting for the Ref in the High-Stakes World of College Basketball, will be published Feb. 3.He wasn\u0027t a monarch who could have accelerated Saudi Arabia\u0027s drive toward modernity. He wasn\u0027t a monarch who ensured gender parity, thereby excluding a demographic majority of his people from contributing to the national welfare. He wasn\u0027t, in the end, a monarch who brought peace and security to a region rife with historical angst and animosities.Bestselling author, historian, biographer, foreign correspondentOn January 28, it will be 90 days since diabetes Type 1 became a part of my 8-year-old daughter\u0027s life.Senior Editor, HuffPost VocesI offer a potential outcome on marriage equality when the Supreme Court takes it up this spring that New York Law School professor Art Leonard suggested as a possibility come June: Chief Justice John Roberts joins the majority and writes the decision himself, making it the narrowest possible ruling with regard to the ramifications for LGBT equality beyond marriage.Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesThe counterintuitive romance is one in which two people who truly shouldn\u0027t fall in love do, often under extraordinary and unromantic circumstances. The protagonists of these love stories breathe the same thin air as anti-heroes and outsiders; they are, in short, unidealized and identifiably human. We\u0027ve compiled six romance films that fit this profile.Editor, bestmoviesbyfarr.comIf you choose to avoid standard, recommended vaccines such as measles, you are not merely putting your own health at risk -- you are choosing to do the same for all the rest of us. Sorry, folks, but that\u0027s the harsh reality.Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterSpeaker Boehner is now using the policy debate on Iran as a crass political attack on the constitutional authority of the president of the United States. In the process, he does great damage to our national institutions, our efforts to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and the U.S.-Israeli alliance.President, Ploughshares Fund; Author, \u0027Nuclear Nightmares: Securing the World Before It Is Too Late\u0027According to the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, it\u0027s illegal to robocall a mobile phone number without permission. The American Bankers Association wants to change that, arguing that robocalls will help fight identity theft and other kinds of fraud.Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911As noted by the Los Angeles Times, \"the anti-vaccination movement is a corner of the United States that is backsliding into medieval ignorance.\" The same holds true for the science deniers of safe, legal abortion.Author, Every Third Woman in America: How Legal Abortion Transformed Our Nation;former Chief of the Abortion Surveillance Branch at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)My decision about whether to engage from the outside or seek elected office came down to a single question: how best can I fight for a level playing field at this point?California Philanthropist \u0026 Climate ChampionMost people think that the recent fracas between Jerusalem and Washington is about Iran. They are wrong. Israel has what it takes to turn much of Iran into a radioactive desert. Nor are the mullahs unaware of that fact. It is about Netanyahu playing the Jewish-American card for the upcoming elections in Israel.Military Historian, Hebrew University (Jerusalem)Latin American leaders greeted with surprise and excitement the resumption of diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States.Professor of Constitutional Law and International Protection of Human Rights; Representative of the Province of San Luis, ArgentinaIt\u0027s become almost routine -- the prosecutions of alleged al Qaeda operatives and spokespeople, men picked up halfway across the world brought to downtown Manhattan, where they\u0027re tried for acts they\u0027re alleged to have committed years ago in cahoots with Osama bin Laden.Senior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstThis new model of governing has statistically proven to be a success in Boston. With fewer resources available for more programs, government must be smarter about how it functions.Chief of Staff, City of BostonNew York City has extraordinarily segregated neighborhoods and radically unequal educational opportunities for its black children. Segregated housing patterns ensure that most black students attend poorly resourced public schools, while schools in predominantly white, wealthy neighborhoods have the resources to help children succeed.Founder, President of the National Urban Alliance for Effective EducationWith each hardship I\u0027ve learned that I am a survivalist. I am resourceful. I am an alchemist of my surroundings. And I\u0027m resilient beyond (even my own at times) belief.Writer, mentor, soulpreneur. Spirited rebel and passionate advocate for self love. Cheerleader for young mothers everywhere.It doesn\u0027t matter where the oil comes from, it doesn\u0027t matter where it goes, and it doesn\u0027t matter if it hurts the U.S. economy or not. They just hands-down love oil.Senior Legislative Representative, GreenpeacePresident Barack Obama continues to speak out against mass incarceration, the devastating impact of our drug policies on communities of color and his expectation that marijuana legalization will continue to spread.Director of Media Relations, Drug Policy AllianceOn yet another anniversary of Roe, women\u0027s health opponents in Congress will mark the occasion by voting for a national ban on abortion at 20 weeks. Even if the ban fails, the right under Roe will still not be realized for millions of women.Executive Director of the National Health Law ProgramJust as an asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs and made way for small, furry mammals, a new wave of planetary disruptions is about to occur. The new asteroid is called \"exponential technology.\" It is going to wipe out industries in a similar manner to the rock that fell to Earth during the Cretaceous. That is the premise of a new book by Peter Diamandis and Steven Kotler.Academic, Researcher, Writer, EntrepreneurGood brows lift the eyes and balance the shape of the face. Unfortunately, a lot of women (and men) are getting too tweezer-happy or don\u0027t know how to properly groom their brows. I\u0027ve lined out a step-by-step guide below to make framing and taming brows as easy as 1, 2, 3!Makeup artistFathers are, in the words of researchers, \"gatekeepers\" of their daughter\u0027s ambitions. Father\u0027s have to put in the time at home doing chores with their kids, especially daughters. Paying lip service to \"equality\" isn\u0027t good enough.Feminist, writer, and satirist (not always in that order)Most human rights advocates would agree that jailing people indefinitely without trial, at times in solitary confinement or other harsh conditions, is hard to justify. The biggest problem with Obama\u0027s call to close the military prison at Gitmo is that it doesn\u0027t go far enough.Editor, Latino VoicesThis week, The New York Times published a comprehensive investigation into deplorable animal treatment at the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u0027s Meat Animal Research Center (USMARC). It\u0027s appalling that such activities -- conducted with the goal of helping a private-sector industry turn a higher profit -- are subsidized by U.S. taxpayers.ASPCA President and CEOSome philosophers have argued that the desire to act in a way that is consistent with one\u0027s values and sense of self is linked to well-being. But others have argued that learning to express thoughts and feelings that obscure one\u0027s true inner state is an important adaptation for successful living. A team of psychological scientists has been working to resolve this issue empirically.Author, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"SCOTUS TAKES UP LETHAL INJECTION",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
