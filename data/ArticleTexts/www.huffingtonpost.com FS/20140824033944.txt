{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Children\u0027s Defense FundI hope political and community leaders of every persuasion will stop grandstanding and showing up for photo ops after the fact and instead will do the hard sustained grunt work of rekindling our children’s hope and sense of adult caring, protection, and fairness. All children must be able to trust adults to struggle day in and day out and year in and year out and decade in and decade out to vote for them and speak for them and hold those in power accountable for just treatment. It’s way past time for the next transforming movement to assure every child in America a level playing field regardless of the lottery of birth.If the media\u0027s job is to give viewers and readers an accurate and full idea of what\u0027s really going on, we have to acknowledge that there is a long way to go. Of course, Ferguson is not an isolated case. But it is a chance for those of us in the media to expand our understanding of our role in covering the news.What if you could choose body parts like you choose a pair of shoes? And what if these prosthetics could help you do new things and express new parts of yourself? Aimee Mullins shares what she calls the poetry of prosthetics.\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"This is the year in which we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Civil Rights Bill. Instead of being able to reflect on the distance we have traveled since 1964, the horrific events unfolding in Ferguson, Missouri only served to remind us of how far we still have to go.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Should they now begin to contemplate taking bold steps and change direction, which appears to be inconceivable at this juncture? I believe that in the long run they will have no other choice. Yet, however incongruous this may seem, it is better to be a fool who tries than a wise man who never dares.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUThe 1960s demand for \"first class citizenship\" echoes through the years as our call to justice today. Unfortunately the Bull Connor images of peaceful protesters were not historic remnants but eerily prescient of tanks and tear gas last week in Ferguson, MO.Chair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusThe need for these drugs is greatest in the countries where the epidemic is raging. Their residents come first. Because clinical trials for safety and efficacy can be carried out only in such countries, even the \"compassionate use\" of an unproven drug in severely limited supply should be granted first to inhabitants of the nations that have been most severely affected.Professor of epidemiology \u0026 population health, Albert Einstein College of MedicineI pray that our relevant, sustained, and commendable outrage and peaceful protest over the death of Michael Brown does not end with Michael Brown. May it enlarge itself to include a relevant, sustained, and commendable outrage against all acts of violence and injustice.Author, \u0027FREESTYLE: Reflections on Faith, Family, Justice, and Pop Culture\u0027; Founding Pastor, Joy Tabernacle A.M.E. Church, Dallas, TexasThe nation\u0027s focus on the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri confers yet another opportunity for deeper racial understanding, but like other (too many other) teachable moments arising from the tragic loss of young black life, the opportunity is fleeting and frail.Executive Director, Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity150 years ago to the day, the first Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field was adopted, declaring that even in times of war, a certain degree of humanity must be preserved. We are now calling for stricter compliance with this principle.President, Swiss ConfederationPresident, International Red CrossAs everyone at GlobalPost and the larger community of journalists who cover conflict struggle with the news, there is deep soul-searching going on about what we do, how we do it and whether the risks are worth it.Training a new generation of international correspondents in the digital ageWhatever one thinks of the President\u0027s actions so far, it does not seem likely that there will be a majority in Congress in the near future to force the withdrawal of U.S. military forces. But there might well be a majority in the near future to insist that a military campaign that goes on for months needs explicit Congressional authorization.Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicyIf there\u0027s one thing we all can agree on, it\u0027s that getting food poisoning can be one of the most miserable experiences imaginable. Thankfully, we know which foods are most likely to make you sick, so be extra-careful when you eat these.TheDailyMeal.comThe assault on the First Amendment by militarized police in Ferguson, Mo., continues unabated, and the press is not spared. Since the start of protests against the August 9 killing of Michael Brown, journalists in Ferguson have been arrested, fired on, threatened, and assaulted.Communications strategist at the ACLURape is not like stealing a bike. Women -- or men, for that matter -- do not have a responsibility to \"lock themselves up\" to avoid rape.Senior Editor/Reporter, The Huffington PostThe central tenet of reproductive justice is that every woman has the right to have children, not have children, and to parent the children we have in safe and healthy environments.President, National Organization for WomenHad Benyamin Netanyahu decided not to use the pretext of three murdered settler youths to launch a pogrom against Hamas in the West Bank and then attack Gaza, much of what Israel considers useful in the status quo would have been allowed to fester.Editor, Middle East EyeAs inequality grows, the rich become more powerful than the rest of the population, enabling them to veto any policy that impedes their one-sided enrichment. They also become less empathetic toward the rest of the population, whose lives seem less similar to their own with each passing year.Lecturer in the College of Business and Economics at California State University, Los AngelesUnwanted guests don\u0027t have to ruin your big day -- as long as you know where to put \u0027em. Meet the top eight nuisances and troublemakers you\u0027ll invite (and learn how you can minimize the damage).The go-to guide for all things weddingsDid you manage to put a big, beautiful checkmark next to some exciting (or romantic or exotic or just plain strange) activity this summer?Award-winning actress, author and activistI created these political cartoons to express my feelings about the current situation in Ferguson, MO. I am a native of St. Louis, by way of East St. Louis, Illinois, a community that mirrors Ferguson in it\u0027s racial and socio-economic climate.Emmy Award winning artist, musician and creative thinker based in St. Louis, MOYes, we\u0027re talking about preserving Net neutrality, preventing the FCC from allowing the Internet to be split into fast lanes for the rich and slow lanes for the rest of us, lanes that could be clogged or blocked to prevent word from getting out about corporate and government malfeasance.Senior writer, Moyers \u0026 Company on public TV. Senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.We all have our areas of interest -- make that obsession -- and when something related to them crops up online, we can be instantly transformed into monster click machines. The problem here: Many of those clicks can either lead to your victimization or becoming an unwitting co-conspirator in cybercrime.Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911In a breathtaking but largely overlooked ruling this week, a federal judge agreed that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers may disregard studies on the health impacts of mountaintop removal mining in its permitting process.Journalist/Historian, www.jeffbiggers.comThe reason so many people don\u0027t get the treatment they need is simple: Mental illness and addiction are still shrouded in stigma. It\u0027s 2014, but people suffering from mental illness often times don\u0027t want to ask for professional help because they fear being labeled as \"crazy\" or a \"whack job.\"Recovery advocate, writer, and proud father of a person in long-term recovery.Zumba\u0027s slogan is \"join the party.\" One of the best decisions I ever made was joining the party. There is rarely a \"maybe later\" in life or dance. Moving in the moment is the only way to heal sometimes.Blog Editor, The Huffington PostOur police departments should not become dumping grounds for weapons makers looking for new clients to replace sales for waning wars abroad. Nor should they be repressive agencies that treat the public, especially black men, like enemies.Co-founder, CODEPINK: Women for PeaceMarried at 23, a mother at 24, and blindsided by divorce at 28, I found myself struggling, like many young women I meet today, to strike a balance between my personal life and my career.Author, Journalist, LecturerIt would be easier to look the other way. It would be easier. But if we continue to blame the others, insist on our inaction and silence, it is we, we, no one else, who is letting our religion be hijacked by this fundamentalist interpretation of Islam.Humanist, writer and academicMy mother has handled me screaming and crying in diapers, screaming and crying as a crazy kid, screaming and crying as a moody teenager, screaming and crying through cancer. She has stuck with me through it all.Junior at Silva Health Magnet High School in TexasIt has come to our attention that your older brothers and sisters have been showing up to Kindergarten completely unprepared for the requirements of a rigorous education.
