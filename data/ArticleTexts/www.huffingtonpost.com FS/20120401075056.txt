{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, I spent a fascinating couple of days at the Skoll World Forum on Social Entrepreneurship in Oxford. I wish everyone could have been there: It was exhilarating -- and deeply moving -- to hear example after example of social entrepreneurs making quantifiable improvements in lives all around the world. As Stephan Chambers, chairman of the Skoll Centre, put it: \"I have cried every day this week. Remember as I tell you this, that I\u0027m male. And British. And from Oxford.\" I actually cried every hour. But, remember, I\u0027m female. And Greek. And from Cambridge. I also cried when Roy Sekoff, our founding editor, texted me that his father, Arthur, had passed away. Besides being a huge supporter of HuffPost (which he rightly felt contained some of his funny, feisty, passionate DNA), he was an eagle-eyed evaluator of my hair whenever I appeared on TV -- good or bad, he let me know about. He was a real character, in the best sense -- a warm, witty, and exceedingly generous man. Read more about him here. He will be missed.Read Post | CommentsStephan Chambers, 03/31/12Chairman, Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship; Director, MBA at Oxford University’s Saïd Business SchoolI have cried every day this week.
