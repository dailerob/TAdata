{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Children\u0027s Defense FundAristotle got it right when he said, \"All who have meditated on the art of governing mankind have been convinced that the fate of empires depends on the education of youth.\" Once upon a time America professed to believe in a strong public education system.

Across-the-board, automatic cuts are set to kick in. That so-called sequestration wouldn\u0027t start, however, until 2013.

That breaks the Norquist pledge and a bad day for Grover is a good day for America.Read Post | Comments (30)Robin Quivers, 11/18/11Anchor, \u0027The Howard Stern Show\u0027One of the questions I hear over and over when child sexual abuse comes up is, \"Why didn\u0027t they tell?\" But when I was trying to figure out how to be safe again after my own experience, telling was one of the first options removed from the table. I didn\u0027t have anyone to tell.Read Post | Comments (59)Jason Linkins, 11/17/11Editor, Eat the PressWhat\u0027s a beleaguered Bank of America to do? Well, it could make a company-wide commitment to offering better customer service and undertake a systemic reform of its business practices. Or, it could hire Malcolm Gladwell as a shill and put him in front of small-business owners!Read Post | Comments (148)Julius Genachowski, 11/18/11Barely half of small businesses have a cybersecurity strategy or plan in place and nearly 80 percent say they lack a written Internet security policy.

And yet names are still free and universal, which increases the pressure to find that one perfect name that defines and encapsulates all your hopes and dreams for your child.Read Post | Comments (220)Joe Peyronnin, 11/18/11NYU Journalism ProfessorThe GOP primary process has been painful and embarrassing, especially for Republicans. While President Barack Obama faces a tough reelection campaign, the Republican Party seems to be doing all it can to help him win a second term. Or, as Governor Perry would say, \"Oops.\"Read Post | CommentsArt Brodsky, 11/18/11Communications Director, Public KnowledgeIt was truly embarrassing to watch the elected representatives prostrate themselves to the entertainment business which is dwarfed, in economic terms, by companies that provide goods and services over the Internet.Read Post | CommentsJose Antonio Vargas, 11/18/11Founder, Define AmericanIllegal immigration is not just about undocumented immigrants like me who contribute to society and pay taxes.
