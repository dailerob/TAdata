{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis was a big week for eggs in the news, both here and abroad. In Iran, hard-boiled hardliners threw eggs and shoes at President Hassan Rouhani\u0027s car in the wake of his historic 15-minute phone call with President Obama, which ended with Rouhani telling Obama to \"have a nice day!\" In the Senate, Ted Cruz took to the floor for his marathon fake filibuster (fauxibuster? fauxibluster? disingenuous waste of time?), scrambling logic and reading Green Eggs and Ham. What Cruz didn\u0027t do in his runny 21-hour rant was provide details of an alternative to Obamacare that would cover the 48 million Americans who will finally get health insurance in January. Meanwhile, House Republicans, falling back on the cliché that you can\u0027t make a Tea Party Omelet without breaking a few eggheads, seem intent on forcing a government shutdown. Here\u0027s hoping less destructive thinking prevails, and that this overcooked political showdown ends sunny-side up.Comments (109)Bill MaherHost of HBO\u0027s \"Real Time with Bill Maher\"Everything Republicans say can\u0027t or won\u0027t work, California is making work. And everything conservatives claim will unravel the fabric of our society has only made California stronger. And all we had to do to accomplish that was vote out every single Republican.Comments (4,624)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027A new pope named Francis is reminding us that love is also a verb. In a tweet, Francis said: \"God will judge us upon how we have treated the most needy.\" Is there a word that more needs to be heard in Washington today than that one? I couldn\u0027t think of any.Comments (85)Arianna HuffingtonThe eulogy is the foundational document of our legacy, of how people remember us, of how we live on in the minds and hearts of others. So the question is: Why do we spend so much time on what our eulogy is not going to be?Comments (134)Rep. Charles RangelRepresentative from the 13th Congressional District in New YorkI\u0027ve been around Congress long enough to know there are issues we may never see eye-to-eye from the opposite aisle, but we should all agree that our job is to move America forward and benefit the people. It\u0027s irresponsible to play games and handcuff the process so that nothing gets done at all.Comments (308)Cecile RichardsPresident of Planned Parenthood Federation of America and Planned Parenthood Action FundToday, Planned Parenthood, the ACLU and the Center for Reproductive Rights filed a lawsuit in federal court to stop the Texas law that would drastically reduce access to safe and legal abortion for many women from taking effect.Comments (157)Desmond Tutu1984 Nobel Peace Prize winnerThe war in Syria should not be viewed in terms of a distant, complex political issue. It is an immediate and very human catastrophe; the biggest one facing the world today. These are our children. And they are dying. Where is the outrage?Comments (100)Diana NyadLong-distance swimmer, journalist, and broadcasterIf it was an 18-hour swim, it was never 17 hours, 57 minutes. It was 18. Along with the training, the organization of an expedition this size, 45 people out into the wilderness that is the unpredictable and dangerous stretch between Cuba and Florida, is monumental.Comments (37)Penn JilletteI want to be a bad guy in my next movie. I want to be a monster. I want to be the nightmare. That\u0027s my goal. It would be a sexier goal, I suppose, if I started out as a really good guy, but I\u0027ve never been hero material.Comments (64)Sheryl Crow and Andrew SharplessImagine you are in the ocean. You hear the lapping of waves, the squeals of dolphins, and the swish of swimming schools of fish -- all sounds you expect to hear underwater. But then a boat glides overhead, and the chatter is drowned by a deafening roar.Comments (51)Jackson BrowneSinger/SongwriterThe problem is not the things we like, it\u0027s the way we do business. It\u0027s the way huge corporations handle distributing goods, maximizing profits. We absolutely have the power to turn this around, to whatever extent that we really want to turn it around.Comments (94)Sen. Kirsten GillibrandU.S. Senator from New YorkWe know the American workforce is changing at a rapid pace as families rely more and more on women\u0027s income to get by. But, as the face of the American workplace has changed, the federal rules that govern it have not kept up.Comments (169)Jim Yong KimPresident, World Bank GroupYou might not believe it, but extreme poverty is in retreat. If the world can avoid becoming complacent and keep momentum on the side of the poor, there\u0027s a real opportunity to end extreme poverty within a generation -- this generation.Comments (69)Joy Martin-MaloneMother, writer, designer and reconstruction extraordinaireImagine my horror when my toddlers took to Disney princesses. The feminist inside me wept -- until, eavesdropping on their usual princess gab, I overheard the following statement: \"My favorite princess is Ariel, and yours is Cinderella, and Mommy\u0027s favorite princess is Sharon Needles.\"Comments (45)Valerie JarrettSenior Advisor to the President and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsAs an estimated one billion additional women enter the global workforce over the next decade, it will be the nations who invest in women\u0027s education, training and full inclusion in the workforce that find themselves in position to compete and lead the world economy.Comments (74)Lewis LaphamEditor of Lapham\u0027s QuarterlyI count it a lucky break to have been born in a day and age when answers to the question \"Why do I have to die?\" were still looked for in the experimental laboratories of art and literature as well as in the teachings of religion. The problem hadn\u0027t yet been referred to the drug and weapons industries, to the cosmetic surgeons and the neuroscientists.Comments (78)JJ KeithWriter www.jjkeith.netThis tendency for vaccinating parents to stay out of the discussion is what\u0027s causing vaccination to lose its bandwagon appeal. Anti-vaxers are loud. The rest of us need to be loud too, because there\u0027s nothing crunchy about a resurgence of polio.Comments (2,257)Bill MoyersManaging Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyGreenpeace International Executive Director Kumi Naidoo joins Moyers \u0026 Company this week to discuss the politics of climate change and the urgency of environmental activism.Comments (24)Rep. Carolyn MaloneyU.S. Representative for New York\u0027s 12th District; Ranking House Member, Joint Economic CommitteeAt our country\u0027s pace of job creation, it would take more than seven years to fully recover all the jobs that were lost in the Great Recession. That is just not acceptable.CommentsRev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkAfter a week which began with 12 killed at a Navy Yard shooting in Washington, and continued with 13 shot at a South Side park in Chicago, we still can\u0027t get Congress to pass legislation on background checks.Comments (481)Kelly LynchBroadcast journalist and radio host, WGY 810 \u0026 103.1 in Albany, NYLook, I don\u0027t blame you for what your kids did. Teens will be teens, and they do stupid things sometimes. It\u0027s not fair to judge parents on the mistakes their kids make. It is how you handle that behavior afterwards that reflects on you as a parent.Comments (1,978)Terrell ThomasCornerback, New York GiantsIt was not through a charity act on the part of the Giants that gave me the opportunity to play football again -- I regained my spot on the team through months of hard work.CommentsTed Danson and Andrew SharplessYesterday the Washington Post published a dangerously misleading article about farmed salmon. Lauding improvements in the salmon farming industry, they assert that farmed salmon is a viable alternative to wild-caught fish. We\u0027d like to set the record straight: farmed salmon is a terrible choice for our oceans.Comments (87)Kate BartolottaOwner and founder, Be You Media GroupKindness costs us nothing and pays exponential dividends. I can\u0027t save the whole world. I can\u0027t bring peace to Syria. I can\u0027t fix the environment or the health care system, and from the looks of it, I may end up burning my dinner. But I can be kind.Comments (351)Thomas E. PerezU.S. Secretary of LaborAs we continue our work to accelerate this economic recovery and restore broad-based prosperity, one of our most critical tasks is to empower American workers with the skills they need to succeed in 21st-century jobs.Comments (13)Diane BenscoterAuthor, \u0027Shoes of a Servant\u0027Extremism has become a sensationalized catchall phrase, often used by politicians and mass media to polarize and to label groups of people as \"the bad guys.\" But, what is extremism? And how do we get to the root of its destructiveness?Comments (451)Rep. Raúl M. GrijalvaCo-chair, Congressional Progressive CaucusIf it hasn\u0027t already, climate change will impact everyone soon regardless of who they are, where they live or how much money they have. American Latinos will be among the most strongly affected. It\u0027s time for us to take the lead.Comments (35)Leo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersDenying food to the hungry, chemo to the cancer-stricken? That is not American. That is what ruthless dictators do. That is the stuff of Kim Jong-il. That is not how Americans treat each other.Comments (369)Angie EpifanoRape Survivor and ActivistI have talked to dozens of Amherst Survivors who prove that my story is not unique. But that is not what many administrations across the county want non-Survivors to know; they want to make sure that Survivors appear to be unique, isolated and crazed.CommentsRobert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Comments (464)Kim SimonMother, Wife, Blogger, mamabythebay.comIf you cover because it makes YOU feel better, then by all means keep covering up. I support you. But if you cover to make OTHER PEOPLE feel better, well then sister, come sit by me and we\u0027ll nurse in public together.Comments (712)Chris Harnick, 2013.29.09Stacy Parker Le Melle, 2013.29.09Craig Crawford, 2013.29.09Steve Mariotti, 2013.29.09C.
