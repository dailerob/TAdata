{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"I\u0027m happy to announce that I\u0027ve just returned home from the hospital with a new arrival. I\u0027m not sure how much it weighs, but it seems to be healthy, and it\u0027s already walking -- albeit unsteadily and with a cane. I\u0027m talking about my brand-new hip, which was swapped in last Tuesday. The surgery -- as well as my blood transfusion the day after -- has opened my eyes and my heart to the issue of blood donations. It\u0027s a very humbling -- even overwhelming -- experience having someone else\u0027s generosity literally being pumped into your veins. After being on the receiving end, I\u0027m looking forward to giving back as soon as I\u0027m able. I\u0027m also looking forward to some other things: hiking, walking without a cane, sitting in the lotus position -- and not looking at every set of stairs like they\u0027re Mt. Everest.Read Post | Comments (21)Maxim Thorne, 10/22/12Senior executive, lawyer, motivational speaker, professor, philanthropist, and consultantTo win in Battleship you have to take out all your opponent\u0027s ships. In chess, you can leave pieces on the Board but still checkmate the King. Romney to his chagrin did not take out all of Obama\u0027s ships. Obama, on the other hand, played his chess game.Read Post | CommentsPaul Chang, 10.22.2012Worldwide Leader, Smarter Supply Chain SolutionsImagine yourself at the helm of a global winery. You make a bet on promoting a lesser-known Chardonnay in a new market and the locals love it. Good news, right? Not if your plans didn\u0027t factor in the risk of selling too much wine in one region.Read Post | Comments (1)Jedediah Purdy, 10/22/12Professor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027It\u0027s time to fight like hell for the party of the center-right, represented by Barack Obama, against the party of the far right. There is no alternative. It\u0027s a time for progressives to be disappointed and resolute.Read Post | Comments (256)Chrystia Freeland, 10/21/12Global Editor at Large, ReutersAmerica today urgently needs a 21st-century Henry George -- a thinker who embraces the wealth-creating power of capitalism, but squarely faces the inequity of its current manifestation.Read Post | Comments (878)Lisa Belkin, 10/22/12Chroniqueuse travail/famille, The Huffington PostWomen will not be equal at work until they are equal at home. And women simply can not be equal at home until the burden of what was once their full-time job is not only shared but lightened.Read Post | Comments (54)Michael Hogan and Christopher Rosen, 10/22/12Joss Whedon deserves some kind of award for turning what could have been the clunkiest superhero-supergroup spectacle since Fantastic Four into a razor-sharp, bullet-fast fun-fest, but they don\u0027t give Oscars for that.Read Post | Comments (38)Jennifer Hyman and Jo Piazza, 10/22/12The solution to breeding self-confidence in women is to celebrate that their reality, Spanx and all, is aspirational in and of itself. That reality is all of the things that make us amazing women -- like our smarts, or our humor or how we love. Beauty is a thing, not the thing.Read Post | CommentsGraham Bensinger, 10/23/12Sports writerI recently sat down with cyclist Tyler Hamilton at his Montana home.

Gerard, 10/22/12International President, United SteelworkersRomney brags about being a businessman. That\u0027s what he is, all right, a used car salesman peddling America an economic lemon. The country can\u0027t afford four years under a President who claims he\u0027ll create 12 million jobs but won\u0027t lift a finger to save 170 in Freeport.Read Post | Comments (150)Rep. Barney Frank, 10/22/12Chairman, Financial Services CommitteeThere is simply no logical basis whatsoever for arguing that voting for Republicans this year is a good way to advance LGBT legal equality.
