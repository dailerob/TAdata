{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersWhat if we found ourselves on the other side of that equation? What if that child\u0027s body on that Greek beach were one of our children? What would we expect and hope for from our fellow human beings? It certainly is not the unforgivable demagoguery that flooded the airwaves on Monday from 24 GOP governors who issued statements saying they would \"not take in\" Syrian refugees in their states. Of course, none of these governors actually has the legal authority to prevent Syrian refugees from coming to their states. The sole purpose of their declarations was political -- to play on the fears that erupted in the wake of the Paris attacks -- to whip up fear of \"the other\" for their own political gain.Faced with a foreign policy question of the utmost gravity, the GOP has turned our relationship with Israel into a weapon of partisan warfare no different than abortion or guns. This, quite simply, is reprehensible as a matter both of national security and simple morality.Novelist and contributing opinion writerShaming the oil and gas industry might very well be a good thing to do, but it is not an academically good thing to do. Saving the world from fossil fuels is not a pedagogical goal and doesn\u0027t belong either in the classroom or in the mission statement of a university.Davidson-Kahn Distinguished University Professor and Professor of Law at Florida International University; Floershimer Distinguished Visiting Professor of Law at Cardozo Law School#PorteOuverte is about open hearts, open minds, open arms and open doors. What we\u0027ve seen these last few days by U.S. politicians has been a shameful subversion of that spirit: closed hearts, closed minds, clenched arms, barred doors.Host/Producer, HuffPost LiveThe most difficult thing that is left to be done after this massacre is to understand what is happening to us, to conceptualize the hate that is enveloping us, to conceptualize the profound threats looming over our democracies.Editorial Director, Le Huffington PostJust what people call this group is important because different names create different degrees of familiarity or foreignness with specific target audiences in order to recruit supporters, identify enemies or persuade the undecided.Independent source of news and analysis, from the academic and research community.After tragedies like this, when there are votes to be gained, who cares about the facts or about basic human compassion?Actress and authorThe next president of the United States will confront a virulent jihadist threat, mounting effects of climate change, and an economy becoming ever more unequal. We\u0027re going to need an especially wise and able leader. Yet our process for choosing that person is a circus, and several leading candidates are clowns.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027The breathless, lurid speculation for weeks until Charlie Sheen stated in an interview today that he is HIV-positive -- and his revelation that he spent millions of dollars to keep the news quiet, extorted by several individuals -- proves just how far we have to go in talking about HIV and in battling the stigma surrounding it.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostAs a Muslim Frenchman, I was completely shocked by these attacks, and because it\u0027s not just France, but Islam and Muslims too, that these phantoms are trying to break.Business school student who grew up on the outskirts of MarseillesSpiritual seekers should not be infantile, fuzzy-brained, naive observers merely standing on the sidelines with nothing to contribute but loving hashtags while the world community faces an unprecedented crisis. Quite the opposite, we should be major factors in healing the crisis.AuthorImperial Washington is so caught up in its myths, lies and hegemonic stupidity that it can not see the obvious. And that is why a quarter century after the cold war ended, peace still hasn\u0027t been given a chance; it is the reason why horrific events like last week\u0027s barbarism in Paris still keep happening.Author, \u0027The Great Deformation: The Corruption of Capitalism in America\u0027Refugees are the most thoroughly screened people who travel into the United States. I am outraged to see people use the Paris attacks as a way to perpetuate the lie that refugees are terrorists. This is a time to stand with victims of this horrifying violence, not foster malicious falsehoods.Executive Director, The Center for Victims of TortureRacial microaggressions are rampant. Faculty and students report feeling tokenized, encountering hostile stares, and their intelligence doubted. While the President and Chancellor\u0027s resignations are a small start, it will take much more for institutional change to follow.Assistant Professor, Graduate School of Professional Psychology, University of St. ThomasAssistant professor, Women’s and Gender Studies and African American Studies, The College of New JerseyProfessor, Counseling Psychology and African and African Diaspora Studies, University of Texas-Austin.As refugees flee a new, if smaller, globally ambitious death cult, the anti-Semitic attitudes of the late-30s are back with a new Islamic target.Senior Editor, Huffington Post CanadaIt would be so simple, for example, for the president to get network time to deliver a national address to the American people, perhaps with a map in the background, to explain what his Administration is doing in fighting ISIS.Last person on Earth not on FacebookOur strategy of war has not been very effective in terms of quelling global terrorism, and it has eroded all of the goodwill we experienced after 9/11. We responded to our tragedy by calling it war instead of murder. I beg the people of France not to make the same mistake America did.Pastor, writer, musicianFacebook has recently launched a limited beta of its ground-breaking AI assistant called M. M\u0027s capabilities far exceed those of any competing AI. Facebook employee David Marcus explained that M is, in fact, human-aided. However, M itself wouldn\u0027t admit it, so I tried to expose that human element.Software Engineer at BitGoWe know that Black students at Yale are underrepresented, as are Black faculty. We call on Yale University to enact the following steps in order to begin a process that mitigates against the individual and community damages caused by the racist structures of education.Author and Yale alumnaWith greater investment in alternative energy innovation, strong political will within Africa and outside its borders, and an end to endemic corruption, Africa could become a leader in sustainability, lighting the way for all of us.Director of Development and Correspondent, Seeker NetworkI am honored to be with you this evening, honored to have been asked to speak to you here in the Hall of Remembrance which, in truth, could and perhaps should be called the Hall of Memory. Why \"memory\" in an institution devoted to memory? Because memory must come before remembrance.Professor of law and son of Holocaust survivorsIf it is to succeed, CVE policy cannot simply offer a counter-narrative to the misguided violent extremist worldview. Realities on the ground must be transformed. Instead of being reactive, with an emphasis on \"countering\" threats, policies should focus on constructing positive alternatives.International Policy Adviser for Human Rights FirstThe millions fleeing ISIS and Bashar al-Assad need the government to get out of the way of their escape. The refugee program allows that escape and does not offer a promising avenue into the United States for would-be terrorists. It would be a tragedy if we were to lose sight of that.Director of Immigration Policy, Niskanen CenterIt was only when Syrian refugees started reaching European shores that the international community began again to look seriously for a solution. I wonder what disaster will it take for the world to seek an end to the region\u0027s forgotten conflict: the civil war currently raging in Yemen.Founder, KaramaNearly a thousand times a day, fire departments across the country respond to home fires. Tragically, an average of seven people die each day from home fires, and 36 more are injured. The worst part of it is that most home fires, deaths and injuries, are preventable.President and CEO, American Red CrossThe traditional practice of opening savings accounts, reviewing loans, and providing other customer services has largely been supplanted by high-risk gambling and the aggressive hustling of dubious investments to unwary clients.Writer/Editor, Bernie 2016The Obama administration is sponsoring a forum this week on the problem of high drug prices. The purpose is presumably to express concern about a rapidly growing problem for both people in the United States and around the world. But the reasons for skepticism are obvious.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027It\u0027s not always easy being a Madonna fan. Her occasional slip-ups notwithstanding -- even I cringe at the opening lines to Rebel Heart\u0027s \"S.E.X.\" -- the real challenge is listening to and reading the criticism that\u0027s been riding the Queen of Pop\u0027s coattails for 30 years.Author, \u0027DJ: The Dog Who Rescued Me\u0027For Democrats in running deep red states, there is a lesson here. Republican divisions may create opportunities for victories, but the path is narrow requiring both a flawed Republican nominee and a divided GOP.Presidential Professor \u0026 Chair of Political Science at the University of OklahomaProfessor and Fellow, Department of Communication and Public Policy Research Institute, Texas A\u0026M UniversityIt is naïve to expect that after four and a half years of fighting for political survival, Assad and the leaders of his security agencies will negotiate their way out of Syria. They will leave only if pressured militarily and if their patrons (Russia and Iran) abandon them.Director, Track II Dialogues initiative, Middle East InstituteNew polling released by impreMedia and Latino Decisions finds that the GOP\u0027s image among Latino voters has significantly deteriorated since 2012. The poll reports that statements by GOP frontrunners Donald Trump and Ben Carson are negatively impacting the overall GOP brand.Leader in Latino political opinion researchGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
