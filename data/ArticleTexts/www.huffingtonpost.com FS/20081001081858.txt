{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOSarah Palin is, by all indications, a bonafide hooplehead -- so dangerously out of her depth and so delusional that she is in total denial about the real-world ramifications of her ineptitude. Instead, she\u0027s excusing her embarrassing television interviews and farcical candidacy as an historical breakthrough for \"normal Joe Six-pack Americans.\" Of course this is great news for the 27 percent who think Bushie is still doing a heckuva job, and for anyone who wants to be president but doesn\u0027t want to go through all of that hard work and fancy book-learnin\u0027 to get there. But if there\u0027s one thing the history of this decade has taught us, it\u0027s that we should vigorously ignore the 27-percent-Bushies at all hazards -- or at least we shouldn\u0027t be encouraging them, as the McCain-Palin ticket appears to be doing.Read Post | CommentsBIOLord Robin Corbett, 10.01.2008The case of Iran and its intransigent mullahs is rarely the focus of McCain and Obama, and voters are being denied the genuine debate and discussion they deserve.Read Post | CommentsBIOBarbara Ehrenreich, 10.01.2008This year marks the 160th anniversary of the Communist Manifesto and capitalism, aka \"free enterprise,\" seems willing to observe the occasion by dropping dead.Read Post | Comments (27)BIODean Baker, 09.30.2008That\u0027s easy. You ask them how failure to pass the bailout will give us a Great Depression.Read Post | Comments (310)BIOHenry Blodget, 10.01.2008Now that the government has been terrified into rubber-stamping the Wall Street bailout, what happens now? I wish the news were better, but in opinion, here\u0027s the most likely scenario.Read Post | Comments (101)BIOJason Linkins, 10.01.2008In the debate rules, Sarah Palin will find her salvation. For while those rules govern the length that each participant may speak, nowhere is it written that Sarah Palin actually has to say anything.Read Post | Comments (73)BIOJudd Legum, 10.01.2008The McCain camp is claiming it didn\u0027t know about Gwen Ifill\u0027s book prior to agreeing to her as moderator for the VP debate. If that\u0027s true, it just shows the campaign\u0027s incompetence.Read Post | Comments (722)BIOAlec Baldwin, 10.01.2008If you give them the $700 billion, make them issue stock. Make every recipient of the bailout issue stock in return for our \"investment.\" Make them sell a stake in their companies.Read Post | Comments (160)BIOJosh Silver, 10.01.2008Turn on your television, turn on your radio, or open your local newspaper, and you\u0027re not going to see what the top economists are saying on the bailout.Read Post | Comments (16)BIOThomas Frank, 10.01.2008The next battle in the political war is going to be assessing responsibility for the destruction of the financial industry. Conservatives are now counter-attacking, in the way they do so well.Read Post | CommentsBIOBarbra Streisand, 10.01.2008The Republicans take every opportunity to shift the political conversation from substance to frivolity. They don\u0027t want the public to see the huge differences between the two parties.Read Post | Comments (32)BIOJane Smiley, 10.01.2008If there\u0027s going to be a bailout, bailout from the bottom and let the benefits trickle upward. The ruling class can\u0027t imagine how things would work for them if we did that.Read Post | Comments (23)BIOPaul Jenkins, 10.01.2008All told, 20 states are currently at high risk of loss by the Republican party in either the presidential election, the Senate race, or both.
