{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIONone of my pro-Hillary female friends are falling for this obvious GOP pander. To the contrary, McCain\u0027s selection of Sarah Palin as his VP is drawing hoots of derision. Once they learn that Sarah Palin opposes rape and incest exceptions for women seeking abortion, they completely write her off. John McCain has gone from maverick to \"me too\" -- trying to out-Democrat the Democrats and pick up some Hillary voters. But it ain\u0027t working.Read Post | CommentsBIOJohn Ridley, 08.29.2008Diversity is not something at which the media has been historically successful. And you got the feeling the media knew they weren\u0027t fielding a representative team. Not since Bill O\u0027Reilly dined with Al Sharpton at Sylvia\u0027s have news people displayed such latent discomfort.Read Post | CommentsBIOWilliam Bradley, 08.29.2008John McCain doesn\u0027t like that he\u0027s lost the change mantle to Barack Obama. We shouldn\u0027t expect to see too much more from Team McCain about how inexperienced Senator Obama is.Read Post | Comments (164)Ari Emanuel, 08.29.2008God forbid something bad should befall a 72-year-old man who\u0027s had skin cancer.

But just because Sarah Palin is a woman doesn\u0027t mean she\u0027s good for women. And female voters know that.Read Post | Comments (15)BIOCharlie Rose, 08.29.2008John McCain has chosen Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to be his vice-presidential candidate. Here is an excerpt of my conversation with Palin from October 2007.Read Post | Comments (12)BIORobert J. Elisberg, 08.29.2008It\u0027s not that Sarah Palin is inexperienced -- it\u0027s that this is gross political misconduct. Do you know what the \"powers and duties\" are for the mayor of Wasilla, Alaska? Check their municipal code.Read Post | Comments (67)BIOBob Cesca, 08.29.2008I\u0027m not sure which was more bizarre today. Palin saying \"nuclear\" with the same \"nookular\" pronunciation as President Bush or FOX News\u0027 Steve Doocy suggesting that she has foreign policy credentials.Read Post | Comments (242)BIOSeth Greenland, 08.29.2008How\u0027s this for a kick in the pants, America! Sarah Palin? Like you saw that one coming!

There\u0027s no more girls up there.\" I love seeing a woman in the fray. But this is indeed an unusual pick.Read Post | Comments (22)BIOAmb. Marc Ginsberg, 08.29.2008If the McCain campaign was hoping to make the issue of experience a determining factor... it just took that issue completely off the table. Welcome Gov.
