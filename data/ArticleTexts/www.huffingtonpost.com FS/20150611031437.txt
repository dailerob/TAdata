{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Author, \u0027Superpower: Three Choices for America’s Role in the World;As the 2016 U.S. presidential candidate heats up, it\u0027s time for an adult conversation about America\u0027s role in tomorrow\u0027s world. Whatever some candidates might say, successful foreign policy is not simply a reflection of the generosity of the president\u0027s vision and the strength of his will. It involves hard choices that require tradeoffs, risk and sacrifice. Yet, for the foreseeable future, the U.S. will remain the only country on Earth with the military, economic and political muscle to persuade governments in every region of the world to take actions they wouldn\u0027t otherwise take. No other country has the hard power, innovative economy and cultural influence that the United States can draw on. The next president will have real options, and it\u0027s time to start debating them.We don\u0027t need hyperbolic statements that our military is the \"finest fighting force\" ever, or that our troops are the world\u0027s liberators and bringers of freedom. Such words are immoderate and boastful. They\u0027re intended to win favor with the troops and with the people back home; they\u0027re politically calculated. And in that sense, they\u0027re ill-advised and even dishonest -- they\u0027re basically nothing more than flattery.Writer, Professor, Retired Lt. Colonel, Air ForceWork is too important to be left entirely to market forces. There\u0027s no shame in job security, just in denying it to other people.Professor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027I\u0027m the girl who would go out with almost any guy who had an interest in me.

Mostly, Dad\u0027s job was to start nearly every speech by saying, \"What Barry meant to say was...\"Author, \u0027Sexy Liberal\u0027It\u0027s too late for Richard Nixon. But not too late from the Republicans -- or the Democrats. In hyper-partisan America, each side seems determined to hate the other, or at least feel morally superior.Author, \u0027Being Nixon\u0027Just as Ariana Grande -- pop princess, wearer of cat ears -- revealed herself to the world as a self-possessed female standing up for other women, Beyoncé -- fierce, outspoken feminist, champion of equality -- told us her secret to flatter abs. It was a confusing day.Writer, Blogger, Journalist, Glitter EnthusiastWe\u0027ve all been through droughts and come out the other side, breathed a sigh of relief, and turned our hoses back on. This one has a new factor, an uncertainty over whether this is a California drought with a limited life, or climate change and a look at the new facts of life in California.Mary Wald is the founder of TheCommunity.com, recent escapee from Los AngelesWhen members of Vice President Biden\u0027s staff get together to reminisce, so many of our fondest memories involve the Biden family: the times when Jill would plot elaborate practical jokes, or when Hunter would tell stories from his childhood. We were always so excited to see them. But we were never more excited than when we found out Beau was joining us.Former chief speechwriter to Vice President BidenSenator Rand Paul is spot on. The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) was created and is fueled by Mr. Paul\u0027s lobotomized neocon rivals.Constitutional Lawyer and AuthorThe news of your death is heartbreaking, yet it has stirred my soul and inspired me to action. Its soul stirring because I refuse to let your death be in vain. I cannot, shall not and will not allow your story to go quietly away.Writer, mentor and motivational speakerTaking a gap year is hardly a revolutionary idea. Our European and Australian counterparts are champs at it. Nonetheless, many view this time as a setback, a waste of time, money and the chance to get a jump on that all-important career. This is short-sighted.Active Duty Army Officer, University of Oxford Master\u0027s Student, Rotary International Scholar, and Veteran’s Advocate.Islay founder, economic geographer, and global nomad currently based in Hawai\u0027iI\u0027ve been working on the ground in Haiti with people who are heroic to me. It has bred this reflection. What my eyes have seen make me grateful to them. What my eyes have seen make me grateful to the American Red Cross.Academy Award-winning actor; Ambassador-at-Large for HaitiThe characters didn\u0027t work for me. What did work was just about everything else.Media Scholar and Critic, zakiscorner.comTurkey is a radically different exemplar from Egypt. It says political differences can be mediated. Political ambitions can be tempered by the popular vote, while seeing through major structural changes to society and the economy, the curtailing of the deep state, and the advancement of minority rights. In a region convulsed, and fractured, by conflict, that is a powerful message.Editor, Middle East EyeWhen Regina had holes over the nipples of her shirt, people weren\u0027t shocked. Instead, every other girl cut holes over the nipples of their shirts. Don\u0027t second-guess yourself; confidence is the sexiest accessory a woman can wear.Deborah is a blogger and founder of Society Letters, a wife, dog mom, design lover, creative free spirit, entrepreneur, child of God, animal advocate, and lover of lifeOne of the main prerequisites to defeating ISIS in Iraq is to determine the political future of Sunni Iraqis. The Sunnis are not prepared to make all the needed sacrifices only to benefit the Shiite government in Baghdad, which they reject and despise even more than ISIS. The Obama administration must begin, concurrently with the fight against ISIS, to negotiate the future status of the Sunni Iraqis.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideA narrow national approach is no longer enough.

You run on issues that define the election as \"us\" versus \"them.\"Professor, George Mason University; contributor, Al JazeeraEveryone has the ability to be a critic, yet no one seems to likes criticism.

If socialism is bad, if Obamacare is bad, if income redistribution is bad, well, how can two hundred million in corporate subsidies be good?Senior Fellow, DemosNo matter when it takes place, lawmakers must oppose TAA.
