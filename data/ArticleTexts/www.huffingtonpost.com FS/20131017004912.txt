{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOThe good news -- and it is very good news -- is that Congress seems to have finally struck a deal that would reopen the government and dodge a debt default. In doing so, lawmakers have avoided (at least for now) a crisis of their own creation that would have tipped the country into recession, caused substantial job losses, and further eroded America\u0027s global standing -- all of which would have also undermined national security. Yet the good news is not the result of a visionary solution that reconciles, even in a limited fashion, material differences of views on the size and scope of government; nor does it fundamentally realign political incentives in a constructive manner. What emerged from Congress on Wednesday speaks to stop-gap measures born of exhaustion and political miscalculations, and prompted by national (and global) outrage.CommentsHoward FinemanEditorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupWin-win is a cool idea -- for social media and much of business life.

If you\u0027re a defensive pessimist, or you\u0027re attempting to motivate one, the strategies that prove effective are often the reverse of what you expect.Comments (28)Princess Haya Al HusseinUN Messenger of PeaceToday, in scores of nations across the globe, there will be conferences, speeches and editorials to celebrate World Food Day. School children will learn all about the latest issues -- fast food versus slow food; food losses and waste; farming and global warning.
