{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Veteran journalist reporting from the United NationsAs columnist Nicholas Kristof wrote: \"They know that illiteracy, ignorance and oppression of women create the petri dish in which extremism can flourish.\" Not always. The young men are not just graduates of the infamous madrassas, some of which are in Syria, Pakistan, and Nigeria and teach a narrow version of the Koran and not much else. Still, the lack of educational opportunities around the world, where 58 million children are not in school and 10 million child brides are married off each year, contribute to the appeal of radicals. It is hard to oppose judicious airstrikes in the short-term. But helping refugees, particularly the three million Syrians in Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon, get proper schooling is vital. Otherwise the bombs will reign for decades.It is time to hold the venture-capital community accountable and to demand that it publish diversity data.Academic, Researcher, Writer, EntrepreneurLove it or hate it, we\u0027re in the home stretch of election season and we\u0027d better start thinking about how we\u0027re going to vote. Especially women and the men who care about them.Money Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsCombine systemic police militarization, the war on drugs, and sloppy police work, and you have the perfect recipe for disaster.Senior counsel, Center for Justice, ACLUWe must build field hospitals and Ebola care units, send health-care staff, medical supplies and logistical coordination, as well as supporting governments and NGOs to stop Ebola transmission through community mobilization to avoid risky funeral and care practices.Director of the London School of Hygiene \u0026 Tropical Medicine; Co-discoverer of EbolaAn elite few who take large sums from Big Pharma very likely sway decision making by countless other physicians, who might not even know they are getting a choreographed, yet subtle, sell-job.Author, \"Unaccountable\"Ritualized IS beheadings tee-us-up for defeat to come. Suddenly confronted with the power and horror of sacral death -- which we are deeply receptive to and yet not equipped to understand -- we move, reflexively, like the monarchies of the 1790s, to simply destroy the bacillus.Professor at The Johns Hopkins University Advanced Academic Programs and the US Naval War CollegeBringing a country or a region out of conflict has taken leaders coming from the ground up, not leaders installed by a super power to serve its economic interests. There is one word today that such leaders seem to understand, repeat, and live by that seems to separate their successes from failures elsewhere. The word is inclusion.Archbishop Emeritus of Cape TownArchbishop Emeritus of Cape TownI\u0027ve realized that everyone processes death in a different way. Knowing this means that you don\u0027t have to second guess your thoughts, feelings and actions. This is your personal journey, and you\u0027re allowed to feel, think, say or do whatever it is that you need to heal.Jinna is a travel \u0026 lifestyle photographer, documenting her adventures at http://greaseandglamour.comAmericans\u0027 commonplace view of ISIL, al Qaeda, and similar groups is one of irrational, hateful savages wreaking havoc as they bomb, rape, and pillage. This view is not wholly mistaken, but it overlooks the causes of this poisonous ideology of Jihadism.Executive Director, MIT Center for International StudiesThe outbreak of Ebola in West Africa has claimed thousands of lives -- more than 3,000 and counting -- and it has the power to take many more. It also has the power to wreck the economies of one of the poorest regions in the world.Senior Director of the World Bank\u0027s Global Practice for Macroeconomics and Fiscal Management - Author of \"Economic Development: What Everyone Needs To Know\".I remember when I got a salad after losing 20 pounds, and the cashier rolled her eyes. I remember losing 50 pounds and being able to hear the click of the seatbelt. I remember losing 80 pounds and being able to wipe myself.Writer, \u0027The Anti-Jared\u0027An open Internet protects opportunities for communities of color. It lets people report on injustice and organize to confront it. It lets artists and creators tell their own stories, rather than depending on traditional media to decide which stories are worth telling.Co-chair, Congressional Progressive Caucus; U.S. Representative for Minnesota\u0027s 5th DistrictWe are having the wrong debate. This isn\u0027t about religion, this is about culture. To understand this we need the context of history -- something both of those nincompoops (and most polemicists) somehow forget.Singer/songwriter, Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic ZerosNo matter what Republicans say, President Obama is not on the ballot this November. The GOP can\u0027t seem to admit to the public that the President has already run his last race.U.S. Senator from CaliforniaAt issue in Integrity Staffing Solutions is the firm\u0027s refusal to pay the warehouse workers for the time spent in a mandatory post-shift anti-theft screening required by Amazon, which takes as long as 25 minutes a day, or as much as two-plus hours each week, per worker.Executive Director, National Employment Law ProjectAs always, in making these determinations I use the criteria of: news I\u0027ve read about each race, all polling data available, and a good dose of common sense. That last one could also be read as \"what my gut is telling me about each race,\" I fully admit.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comTonight I\u0027m joined by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and immigration activist Jose Antonio Vargas. I asked him whether or not as a journalist he believes the media have accurately covered the immigration debate.PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorStewart\u0027s commitment to this independent drama -- and her appearance in front of hundreds of law school students Tuesday -- seems far from the \"celebrity headlines\" she often elicits.Director of undergraduate film studies, Columbia University; Moderator \"Reel Pieces,\" 92Y; and author of PHILIP KAUFMANThe tracker is legit -- but only as legit as the people in the store let it be. The fact is, there are a lot of factors that happen in a store that the tracker can\u0027t always account for, and so your mileage may vary with the online tracker for those reasons.Ordained pastor, writerThe goal of the lawsuit -- to provide even more for AIG\u0027s bailed-out shareholders -- seems absurd. But at least this lawsuit, which has already seen testimony from two former Treasury secretaries, is finally giving the American people some hard lessons in the workings of the bailout process and the shortcomings of our current economic system.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourDear women voters: It\u0027s our time, ladies. A midterm election looms, and the focus is on us! Politicians and pundits alike know that there\u0027s no crossing the electoral finish line without women voters in their corner. But are the candidates seeking to represent us talking about the issues we care about?Vice President of Government Relations at the American Association of University WomenThe majority of items sold in duty-free shops are products that are usually slapped with high taxes when sold in a country\u0027s regular stores. In some places like Europe, buying duty free is a glorious way to avoid paying that local tax, so there\u0027s that added bonus.Teaching the art of travel.The immediate task before us is the containment of the Ebola outbreak. For the moment, little else matters. But we still must confront the larger challenge. We must make the repair of public health systems in developing countries a global priority.President, Population InstituteIn the weeks following the atomic attacks on Japan in 1945, and then for decades afterward, the United States engaged in airtight suppression of all film shot in Hiroshima and Nagasaki after the bombings.Author and BloggerA small story that may shed light on the Chinese government\u0027s fear of the protests in Hong Kong: Five days before pro-democracy activists took to the streets there, I received word from the U.S. Consulate in Guangzhou that our cultural diplomacy tour was in jeopardy.Director, International Writing Program, University of IowaRussia is home to one fifth of the world\u0027s wild forests. Infuriatingly, they are cutting them all down.Broadcaster, Conservation BiologistHelp raise concern, Get people thinking and talking. Whether a candidate is running for Congress or a county board, they need to see and hear that people in their communities care about mental health care.Executive director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)What is your life at the end of the day, other than an accumulation of the many small moments and experiences you\u0027ve lived through? Is it worth sitting out from extraordinary experiences if it can help you relate to other people? Or would you rather live in the moment and face potential dissonance with your peers later?Productivity blogger and happiness life hackerThe whole episode is a microcosm of what is wrong with politics in America, right now. While many on the left blame the Tea Party, or the Koch Brothers, for the degradation of our politics, and those on the right blame President Obama, the media is just as culpable.Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranTwo recent massacres committed by government officials indicate that the country may be headed towards a rerun of the \"dirty wars\" of the 1970s, in which the government hunted down and killed or jailed thousands of activists.Professor, UNAM-Mexico City; Editor-in-Chief, Mexican Law Review; Columnist, Proceso and La JornadaGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"SAY AAAAAH!",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
