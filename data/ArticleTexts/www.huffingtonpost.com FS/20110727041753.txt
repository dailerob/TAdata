{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"There is still no deal in the debt ceiling impasse between Congressional Republicans and the president, so we can\u0027t say who \"won.\" But we can definitely say who lost: America. Even if we ultimately get the touted \"Grand Bargain,\" it\u0027s not going to be grand for anybody who correctly identifies unemployment and our economy\u0027s anemic growth as the biggest crises we\u0027re facing. After the champagne has been uncorked and lots of backs have been slapped in DC, the lives of regular Americans will not be better -- indeed, they will almost certainly be worse. Here\u0027s the maddening part: if Congress and the president had focused on the crisis of jobs and growth, the solutions they would have come up with would also have been the best solutions to the long-term debt crisis. The fact is, you can cut all the discretionary spending you want -- but it\u0027s growth, not cutting that will solve our long-term deficit problem.Read Post | CommentsJason Linkins, 7/26/11Editor, Eat the PressHonestly, America, if you want to deliver the right message to your representative, you need to call them up, repeatedly, and make this simple demand: \"Raise the damn debt ceiling.\"Read Post | CommentsAlbert Brooks, 7/26/11Filmmaker; Author, \u00272030: The Real Story of What Happens To America\u0027Isn\u0027t the whole point of winning the office of president that you can talk to the nation without others belittling what you say? I began to think of some the great presidential moments and what their rebuttals might have sounded like, had they been allowed at the time.Read Post | CommentsJenny Rosenstrach, 7/26/11Author, \u0027Dinner: A Love Story\u0027As soon as I drew up summer reading lists with point systems and rewards, my 7-year-old was curled up with the dog on the couch reading Amulet (10 points) and her sister was asking why the library has to be closed on the Fourth of July.Read Post | CommentsRobert L. Borosage, 7/26/11President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureThe proud liberal leader of House Democrats, excluded from many of the debt negotiations because she insisted on defending Social Security and Medicare, has now capitulated to the austerity caucus. And the GOP still refuses to take yes for an answer.Read Post | CommentsLaura Schocker, 7/26/11Associate Editor, Healthy LivingSleep and I have a dysfunctional relationship. So it\u0027s time.

Dennis Kucinich, 7/26/11U.S. Representative from Ohio\u0027s 10th DistrictSocial Security is 100% wholly funded up to the year 2036 without any changes whatsoever. It has no place in the debt ceiling debate at all. Furthermore, it is not the government\u0027s money but the money of the workers who have paid into the program their entire lives.Read Post | CommentsAri Melber, 7/26/11Correspondent, The Nation; AttorneyThe most significant moment in Obama\u0027s unprecedented deficit address came not in an original announcement or last-minute proposal, but in the president\u0027s request that Americans actually get up, get involved, and ask Congress to lay off the insanity.Read Post | CommentsRobert Greenwald, 7/26/11Filmmaker, Brave New FilmsNews Corp could follow the lead from dozens of prior companies and hire outside legal counsel to oversee the investigation.
