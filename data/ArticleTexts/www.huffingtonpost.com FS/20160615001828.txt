{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Novelist and contributing opinion writerPaul Ryan is not merely a captive in Donald Trump\u0027s hostage video. He is a politician caught between his rejected ideology, and the racist pseudo-populism of an interloper who emerged from the political and moral void he and his party helped create. Trump, of course, will lose. But he will leave behind a Republican Titanic, headed for an electoral iceberg which will shatter the party for years to come. Ryan may survive as speaker by clinging to some piece of ideological flotsam -- if only because no one else will want the job. But he will never rise above the waterline -- not in 2020, or ever. The shipwreck is catastrophic, and its fatalities include the party\u0027s would-be savior, President Paul Ryan.We now know that this was the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. We pray for the victims and their families. We stand in solidarity with the city of Orlando and the LGBT community. Yet even as we take those appropriate steps, we must confront a difficult truth: These mass shootings have not abated.U.S. Senator from PennsylvaniaI have one message for those families in Florida: I am sorry. I am so, so sorry. I am sorry that our tragedy here in Sandy Hook wasn\u0027t enough to save your loved ones.Founder \u0026 Director, The Ana Grace ProjectLet\u0027s call out Trump for what he is. He\u0027s the flipside of Omar Mateen -- a man driven by hate, a man who would call America to define itself by its hates. Tragically, the Trumps of the world and the Matteens of the world feed on each other. They need each other. They stoke each other.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Mr. Trump: We are not in solidarity with you, nor do we want your thanks. The bodies of our slain LGBTQ Latinx brothers and sisters weren\u0027t even counted when you tweeted yourself a pat on the back. How dare you use them as political props.Writer, blogger and activistAs thanks, NRA designs special gun just for Trump.TV writer/producer, graphics artist and cartoonistRyan hopes his endorsement of Trump will help his club win. It\u0027s my club, too. But it\u0027s also my country, which means more to me than my political party.Fmr. Republican member of Congress, representing Oklahoma for 16 yearsAwash in so much data, it is hard to know which have long-term value and which we can ignore.Author, When We Are No More: How Digital Memory Is Shaping Our FutureNewt Gingrich\u0027s supposed smartness is rather indiscriminate, when examined closely. Newt has what he considers 10 or 12 brilliant ideas each day, which he is in the habit of just tossing out for discussion.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comGet together, make a new social contract, keep your citizens safe. Take on the Feds, take on the courts, take on those craven legislators bought or cowed by the NRA, and tell them there will be no more guns in our cities. Period.Democratic Theorist; Author, \u0027If Mayors Ruled the World\u0027 (Yale University Press); Founder, Global Parliament of MayorsAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one out of three people age 65 or older falls each year, and more than 700,000 are hospitalized due to a fall injury, most often a head injury or hip fracture.To these LGBT Latinos/as, gay bars and clubs are sanctuaries of safety, understanding and fellowship with people who look and sound like us, and who live with many of the same challenges that we do.Professor and academic dean, American University Washington College of Law; @TonyVaronaIf you are at all like me, you woke up Sunday morning to the horrific story out of Orlando, Florida that rocked you to the core. Many Americans are left wondering how we can process the grief, frustration, fear and anger that washes over us every time there is a senseless attack on innocent people in our country. The sad fact is we simply do not have the tools or the tests to predict who is or is not going to commit an act of violence. But, what we can do is work to prevent the senseless acts from happening by being more situationally aware.Author, Host \"Dr. Phil\"It\u0027s time to jettison the idea that America is at war with \"radical Islamic terrorism.\" Islam is not America\u0027s enemy.Author, \"The Fear of Islam: An Introduction to Islamophobia in the West\"We are seeing an alarming rise in the number of reports of attacks against women by their families. What is so saddening is that it is perpetuated by their own fathers, mothers and brothers, the very people who should be protecting them.Director-General, International Planned Parenthood FederationI know Omar Mateen. He was that classmate who constantly joked that I am into kissing boys, who sniggered behind my back and called me gay. He was the father who never hesitated to teach his son that liking boys is wrong. His disgust for two men kissing -- I felt that before.LGBT rights ninjaWhen told that Mr. Trumpf\u0027s birth certificate indicated that his race is Caucasian, the challenger whispered, \"How do we know it\u0027s real?\"USC Professor and author of \"Spiritual Delights \u0026 Delusions,\" \"Billy Graham \u0026 Me,\" and \"Israel Undercover: Secret Warfare \u0026 Hidden Diplomacy in the Middle East.\"The fact that ISIS capitalizes on this hatred should not surprise us. But it would be tragic if the terrorist organization became the tree that hides the homophobic forest.Writer and DirectorDon\u0027t let Republicans tell you that they\u0027re tough on terror. Don\u0027t let them tell you that they\u0027ll keep you safe. And never for one moment believe that they aren\u0027t paid for and fully owned by America\u0027s most dangerous special interest.Writer, layabout and all-around nogoodnik; web publisher; former Associate News Editor, The Huffington PostThis is the second time a city I live in has been labeled the \"worst\" shooting site. Violence and terrorism thrive on our continued inability to find common solutions.Academic, author, book editorLast fall, when presidential wannabe Donald Trump famously boasted on CNN that he would \"be the best thing that ever happened to women,\" some may have fallen for it. Millions of women, however, reacted with laughter, irritation, disgust, and no little nausea.Author, \u0027They Were Soldiers: How the Wounded Return From America’s Wars -- The Untold Story\u0027Thanks to Mr. Lyon\u0027s lawsuit, detained immigrants will finally be able to work on securing the documents and support they need, rather than grasping at a lifeline that is always just beyond their reach.Senior Staff Attorney ACLU of Northern CaliforniaStaff Attorney, ACLU\u0027s National Prison ProjectThis is precisely what terrorists, extremists and groups like ISIS want -- division. We cannot succumb to such fear and disunity; we must remain vigilant in our will to stop any and all acts of terrorism, and denounce both homophobia and Islamophobia. This is a moment where we are being tested, and we cannot fail by answering hate with more hatred.President, National Action NetworkI believe that prayer does matter, especially after the Orlando massacre -- and it\u0027s an argument I\u0027ll make with all due respect to those critics who believe prayer is a senseless waste of time.Associate Professor of Religious Studies, College of the Holy CrossLet\u0027s start by calling for a full-on permanent ban on weapons like the AR-15, guns that were designed to do exactly what they did, in Orlando, in Aurora, in Newtown, in San Bernadino, in Umpqua.Filmmaker, Brave New FilmsToday, it is our obligation as a queer community to remember that islamophobia, homophobia, and transphobia work together.Genderqueer advocate, movement organizer, and part-time fashion iconWe witness colonialism and its brutal impact day in and day out, but often stand by silently while our government violates the most basic and fundamental rights of millions of citizens -- the right to autonomy, to freedom to sovereignty and to dignity.Associate Counsel at LatinoJustice PRLDEFAt this point, it\u0027s our fault. It\u0027s our fault for listening to hollow promises made by people who have no intention of doing anything. It\u0027s our fault for believing the spin from this side or that side. It\u0027s our fault for becoming desensitized to mass shootings.JournalistFrance was resilient and steadfast following the 2015 attacks, and the United States will be resilient now.U.S. Ambassador to the French Republic and the Principality of MonacoWhile the person who pulled the trigger is dead, the people who made this possible are still alive. Horrific tragedies like this flourish after being nurtured in an environment where hatred is perpetuated in subtler ways on a daily basis.Celebrity makeup artist, Mexican American, tall vegan gay guy, with two adopted chihuahuas.American citizens face an enormous responsibility right at home. The undermining of functioning democracy is one of the contributions of the neoliberal assault on the world\u0027s population in the past generation. In Europe, the impact may be even worse.Institute Professor emeritus, MIT Department of Linguistics and Philosophy; Author, \u0027Who Rules the World?\u0027Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
