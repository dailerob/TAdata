But I believe we have a valuable opportunity to make progress in dealing with them, through a collaboration between religion and science.\" When the two come together, the result is the cultivation of connection -- of empathy and compassion. At the heart of this approach is the Buddhist belief in the mutability of consciousness -- the idea that we can, through certain practices, change our inner being. \"It means that the cultivation of loving-kindness can over a period diminish the force of hate in the mind,\" he explains.Read Post | CommentsMohamed A.
