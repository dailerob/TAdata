{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editorial director, Le Huffington PostThere we go, it\u0027s done. The French wanted change. Nicolas Sarkozy has lost his bid for re-election. On Monday, we\u0027ll start evaluating the downfall of the outgoing president, who went from being a popular candidate in 2007 to a president quickly pushed aside by his fellow citizens.

This makes it a magnet for politicians, not so much for the old reason, publicity, as for the proximity of money.Read Post | Comments (125)Pauline Millard, 05/06/12NYC-based writerWith Yauch\u0027s passing, it really is the end of an era. New York City is a very different place than it was when the Beasties were coming up in the game, and music and art can\u0027t move forward when the artists themselves are in many ways trying to recreate the past.Read Post | CommentsFahad Faruqui, 05/06/12Writer.
