{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorBen Bernanke has been saying that the economy\u0027s getting a bit better, so interest rates are going up. And at some point, sooner than later, he and his buds at the Federal Reserve are going to start adding a bit less juice to the punch bowl. I don\u0027t really know what to make of the markets and I suspect they\u0027re just going to be volatile for a while. But it\u0027s the real economy I\u0027m worried about, and I used to have a friend in Bernanke when it came to that. Now, I\u0027m not so sure. Fed policy always has costs and benefits and deep monetary stimulus is no free lunch. But as long as the broader economy remains in the residual gravitational pull of the great recession, the benefits of the Fed\u0027s aggressive actions outweigh the costs. I get that they\u0027re planning their pivot, which isn\u0027t the same as pivoting. But they\u0027re doing so too soon.Comments (136)Candy ChangArtist, TED Senior FellowContemplating death is a powerful tool to re-appreciate the present and remember what makes your life meaningful to you. We\u0027re all trying to make sense of our lives and there\u0027s great comfort in knowing you\u0027re not alone.Comments (228)Bob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowWho could\u0027ve guessed that force-feeding horror stories about terrorism into minds of the American public and news media in order to establish a massive eavesdropping infrastructure would give rise to the NSA\u0027s intelligence gathering operations just several years later?Comments (128)David Katz, M.D.Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterThere is a certain irony in the nearly immediate juxtaposition of the rare introduction of a new FDA-approved drug for weight loss (Belviq) to the marketplace and the recognition of obesity as a \"disease\" by the AMA. A line from the movie Jerry Maguire comes to mind: \"You complete me!\"Comments (118)Bill GeorgeProfessor of Management Practice, Harvard Business SchoolToday\u0027s pace and stress are so great that people are searching for new practices to find resilience in the midst of chaos, and mindfulness programs are helping them find better ways to live.Comments (88)Desmond Tutu1984 Nobel Peace Prize winnerIf the corporate thinking that places profits over our own humanity has begun to invade the American university system, causing it to bow to pressure from some of the worst human rights violators in our world today in favor of expansion into the Chinese market, it has gone too far.Comments (29)Jodi Ellen MalpasAuthorBeing a British writer, I\u0027m all about the knickers, but I\u0027m quite partial to some panties, too! I can remember the first email that I received asking me what a jumper was, and then another wanting clarification on what knickers were.Comments (113)Dr. Jill BidenSecond Lady of the United StatesSmall businesses play a critical role in helping our economy, but to stay competitive they need access to a motivated, flexible and skilled workforce.Comments (21)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundMany leaders and philosophers say we should end poverty, but through his visionary innovation, tireless hands-on work, and dogged unwillingness to accept it, Dr. Muhammad Yunus has made ending the cycle of poverty a reality.Comments (17)Susan SarandonActress, activist and motherIn 2012 I supported Amendment 64 in Colorado, a common sense step toward ending the archaic prohibition mindset that has resulted in the U.S. leading the world in the incarceration of our people -- a prison system packed with non-violent drug offenders.Comments (285)Mike RyanSenior Entertainment Writer, The Huffington PostWorld War Z, a movie about zombies, will soon be in movie theaters. Brad Pitt (The Devil\u0027s Own) stars as man who does not want to be eaten by zombies. He also does not want his family to be eaten by zombies. It\u0027s safe to say that Brad Pitt\u0027s character frowns upon zombies who eat people.Comments (46)Lauren WarnerBlogger and Editor, 3 Things For MomI cannot tell you what challenges your precious one might have -- just as I cannot tell you what challenges anybody\u0027s child will have, \"special needs\" or not. One aspect of your child\u0027s life just happens to be detectable by prenatal medical technology.Comments (133)Arianna HuffingtonIn this week\u0027s issue, Tom Zeller looks at the American fishing industry and three different factors affecting it, and Mallika Rao puts the spotlight on the rise of Braco, a Croatian healer whose method is simple and, some say, miraculously effective.CommentsMaureen RyanTV critic, The Huffington PostHannibal is a monster, of course, but Mads Mikkelsen\u0027s performance and the show\u0027s great writing for the character limned a portrait of a very human monster, one whose terrible actions begin in a somewhat understandable place.Comments (15)Rev. Jim BallAuthor, \u0027Global Warming and the Risen LORD: Christian Discipleship and Climate Change\u0027The Washington Post\u0027s Juliet Eilperin reports something I never would have thought in a million years. Google is supporting one of the worst climate-denier organizations in the worldComments (24)Jim Yong KimPresident, World Bank GroupOver the last 20 years, the World Bank Group has helped countries lift 663 million people out of poverty. In the next 20, we believe it is possible to end extreme poverty. This goal is within our grasp. But if we don\u0027t confront climate change, we won\u0027t end poverty.CommentsShelley EmlingEditor, Post 50People always say that my daughter looks just like my husband and nothing like me, a remark that\u0027s a bit disheartening considering that, in their next breath, they usually note how pretty she is.Comments (36)Franco NuscheseBoard member, Global Virus NetworkOne only needs to think for a moment about SARS and HIV-AIDS and try not to shudder. It\u0027s not just about health, it\u0027s also about how it affects economies and national security. Governments cannot carry the burden of viruses and disease by themselves.CommentsJim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027Skepticism is a good and healthy thing. But cynicism is a spiritually dangerous thing because it is a buffer against personal commitment. Personal commitment is all that has ever changed the world, transformed human lives, and altered history.Comments (38)Gabe ZichermannChair, GSummit; speaker; author, \u0027Gamification Revolution\u0027As the U.S. eagerly awaits a ruling from the Supreme Court on two major gay rights cases, it seems appropriate to spend a few minutes checking out some of the funniest, most moving and best online and TV ads in support of gay marriage from around the world.Comments (18)Alina TugendAuthor, \u0027Better by Mistake: The Unexpected Benefits of Being Wrong\u0027Being so hard on ourselves reflects the great fear many of us having of falling short. And one of the key obstacles all of us are going to have to overcome to be healthier and happier is to accept that not only do we all make mistakes, but we must do so in order to create and take risks.Comments (13)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorToday, the federal minimum wage stands at $7.25 per hour. Had it simply kept pace with inflation since 1968, it would be about $10.70 per hour, which amounts to nearly $300,000 in lost wages. So where did the billions of lost wages go?Comments (108)Alison RosenCo-host, Adam Carolla Show; host, Alison Rosen Is Your New Best FriendThere was a time when having a nuanced, measured, well-considered take on something, one that didn\u0027t fit neatly into a, well, box was appreciated. Those days are gone.Comments (26)Teo BishopContemplative Pagan, BardI hold up to the sun my heart, that the bright light on the Summer Solstice might fill it with the spirit of life and vitality.Comments (21)Mark SissonFormer elite marathoner and triathlete; Author, \u0027The Primal Blueprint\u0027We do not need grains to survive, let alone thrive. In fact, they are naturally selected to ward off pests, whether they be insects or hominids. I suggest we take the hint and stop eating them.Comments (545)Jordan SchultzThe Huffington Post\u0027s sports columnist, The Schultz ReportGame 6 of the NBA Finals was such a seesaw battle of emotions and just sheer basketball that nobody, perhaps not even the San Antonio or Miami players, knew what Game 7 would bring us. And, after a two-point Heat lead at halftime where a series of jabs and hooks were thrown, LeBron James and Dwyane Wade offered a solution: Play like the superstars they are.Comments (26)James BursleyResearcher, Neuroscience and Psychology, Carnegie Mellon UniversityWhat if distractions are actually an important part of one\u0027s job performance, productivity and creativity, perhaps even more important than evenings of overtime spent beating one\u0027s head against yet another intractable problem?CommentsHelen SmithAuthorIt seems that fewer and fewer people in general are getting married these days, and even fewer men. Men no longer see marriage as being as important as they did even 15 years ago.Comments (610)Tom MulhallNude Recreation Specialist Owner Terra Cotta Inn Clothing Optional Resort, Palm Springs, CACities, counties and states all have public golf courses, tennis courts, parks, and beaches for the clothed public. Where are all the topless and nude beaches?Comments (46)May Benatar, Ph.D., L.C.S.W.Licensed clinical social worker specializing in adult development, parenting and the treatment of the long-term effects of psychological traumaI do not know in which group I will find myself at the end. Will I cling or will I go accepting what is ahead?Comments (11)Nan AronPresident, Alliance for JusticeThe Italian Colors ruling is not an isolated event. We are rapidly approaching a time when there is a private set of laws for big corporations, created and enforced by and for themselves and separate from the system that governs the rest of us.Comments (75)Joan B.
