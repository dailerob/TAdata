{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Author, \u0027Dangerous Ground\u0027Rather than blame Barack Obama or George W. Bush for the creation of ISIS, Americans should place the blame right where it belongs -- on the Saudi royal family. But then blame likewise must be apportioned to every American president who has acted to sustain America\u0027s oil-based relationship with the Saudis originally struck by Franklin Roosevelt -- Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush 41, Clinton, Bush 43 and Obama. Every president named was made aware of the unsavory nature of the Saud-Wahhabi alliance, and every president chose to ignore it.

I will be referred to as \"the former director\" of Late Show With David Letterman. Along with the name change, comes the surrender of an all-access pass to New York City.Late Show with David Letterman, Director and Supervising ProducerPsychological research tells us that introspection is often a highly inaccurate source of self-knowledge. An over-reliance on introspection trips one up -- decreasing performance, reducing decision quality and even undermining self-insight.Research Editor at The Huffington PostOne day I came across a photo of me in my twenties, and it struck me how much I never wanted to go back. Those were sometimes rough and lonely years -- even with a fit, flat stomach. I liked myself in my mom form more than I ever had when I conformed to the social \"ideal.\"K.K. Goldberg, author of The Doctor and The Stork: A Memoir of Modern Medical Babymaking, forthcoming October 2015During the 2010 campaign for governor, Scott Walker famously promised to create 250,000 jobs in his first term.

Fast track must not be approved until this is cleared up. We the People deserve to know what is being voted on with fast track.Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureThe State of Oregon prohibits its fishermen from using these deadly nets -- leaving California as the only West Coast state still allowing fishermen to use them.ActressCEO, OceanaThe Internet can be intrusive, yes, but it can also be a voice of comfort -- and, in my case, a close friend leaning in to whisper, \"You know how you thought your dad was the greatest guy in the world? You were right. Let me tell you why.\"Glamour magazineToday, women comprise 47 percent of our workforce and our numbers are growing. In addition to being primary caretakers for our families, women are becoming primary income-earners, too.CEO of the Women\u0027s Foundation of California.What\u0027s worse than being older and hungover?
