Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoIn the face of this national tragedy, President Obama says this is not the time for politics but for prayer. But this is the time for politics, before we do what we always do after such massacres -- shed some tears, express our grief, say a few prayers, and then quickly go on to do what the gun lobby wants us to do: change the subject. But if the United States had the same gun murder rate as England or Canada, thousands of American men, women and children who were slaughtered by gunfire in 2011 might still be alive today. If the United States had the same gun murder rate as England since 2000, tens of thousands of slain American men, women and children might still be alive today.Read Post | Comments (1,926)Gary Hart, 07/21/12President, Hart International, Ltd.Much of our life is dedicated to an attempt to understand through reason -- rational, logical thought -- our existence. But when one human kills a dozen or more other humans who represent no threat to him, nothing seems to make sense, nothing is reasonable or rational.Read Post | Comments (87)Cenk Uygur, 07/21/12Host, \u0027The Young Turks\u0027It\u0027s a trick. When people tell you that you shouldn\u0027t politicize a tragedy like the shooting in Aurora, Colorado they are unwittingly helping to spread NRA propaganda.Read Post | Comments (528)James Zogby, 07/21/12President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027As important as it is it is to defend Huma Abedin or to rebuke Michele Bachmann, this is not enough.

Hundreds of years after Americans first made that connection, what will it take for us to get it again today?Read Post | Comments (186)Mark Hyman, MD, 07/21/12Practicing physicianEmotional eating has become ubiquitous in our fast-paced culture, which honors quantity over quality, willpower more than pleasurable nourishment and the dollar more than humanity.Read Post | Comments (32)Arianna Huffington, 07/20/12In 1962, Rachel Carson began sounding the alarm about the dangers of exposure to chemicals and the failure of the industry and regulators to protect people from those dangers. Fifty years later, Lynne Peeples\u0027s anniversary feature in Huffington is a reminder that we have failed to heed many of Carson\u0027s warnings, especially when it comes to protecting our most precious resource, our children.Read Post | Comments (245)Brian Levin, J.D., 07/21/12Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityThe public and the media has a right to fully examine newsworthy events about unusual and horrendous crimes.
