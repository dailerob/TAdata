{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The economy faces a persistent budget crisis. Pushback from Wall Street has gutted most of the banking reforms, unemployment is stuck around 8 percent, corporate profits have been soaring while there is no wage growth -- and the newest White House proposal is... a free trade zone with Europe. This idea of a Trans-Atlantic Free Trade Area was tossed in, reportedly at the last moment, to President Obama\u0027s State of the Union, and is being promoted in the government\u0027s latest report on trade. You don\u0027t know whether to laugh or cry. This is a classic case of changing the subject to a cause that will not address any of the economy\u0027s deeper ills and could well worsen them. It recalls the very old joke about the drunk looking for his keys under a lamp post. He mentions to a cop that he lost the keys somewhere else, but \"this is where the light is.\"Read Post | Comments (130)Howard Fineman, 03/04/13Editorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupThe capital\u0027s dysfunction is leading some thinkers here to conclude that \"power\" no long exists. In a tribal and digital world, the theory goes, top-down authority is dead. Anyone who believes that needs to see R.J. Cutler\u0027s calmly voiced yet disturbing new feature documentary called The World According to Dick Cheney.Read Post | Comments (449)Scott Hebner, 03.04.2013VP of Marketing and Strategy, IBM Cloud \u0026 Business InfrastructureRemember the Internet in its early stages? Fast forward to today. I get into my car in the morning on the way to work and my phone checks the traffic, finding the best route. During a quick stop at Starbucks, my Starbucks card pops up on my phone as I walk through the door so I don\u0027t have to open the app to pay. Another app streams personalized music during my commute.Read Post | CommentsAaron Belkin, 03/03/13Author, How We Won: Progressive Lessons from the Repeal of \"Don\u0027t Ask, Don\u0027t Tell\"Every time Republicans mention a \"spending crisis,\" we should remind them that our non-military spending is at historic lows (to say nothing of the fact that they were the ones who busted the federal budget with tax breaks for the rich.)Read Post | Comments (940)Dr. Joel Hoffman, 03/04/13Author, Speaker, and ScholarIn other words, sometimes \"believing the Bible\" means believing that a story in it didn\u0027t happen.Read Post | Comments (1,764)Robert Redford, 03/04/13Actor, director and environmental activistIt is time to take a hard stance on Keystone XL. We need a clear evaluation of the damage to our health and environment that will result from this dirty energy project. And then we need to reject the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline.Read Post | Comments (69)Robert Reich, 03/04/13Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The President must reframe the public debate around the future of the country and the investments we must make together in that future, rather than austerity economics.Read Post | Comments (203)Sec. Kathleen Sebelius and Sec. Arne Duncan, 03/04/13Early childhood education is one of the best investments we can make in America\u0027s future. Now is the time to redouble our efforts, not cut back. Doing right by our youngest children is essential to America\u0027s middle-class promise. We look forward to working together to make it happen.Read Post | Comments (81)Jeffrey Sachs, 03/04/13Director, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \u0027The Price of Civilization\u0027It is easy for progressives to blame the Republicans for the sequestration and to view President Obama as having waged a last-ditch effort against these cuts. This is too easy. Many have been confused by focusing on Obama\u0027s eloquent speeches and progressive vision while missing his actual budget policies.Read Post | Comments (490)Tom Engelhardt, 03/04/13Editor, TomDispatch.comTwo Sundays ago, I traveled to the nation\u0027s capital to attend what was billed as \"the largest climate rally in history\" and I haven\u0027t been able to get the experience -- or a question that haunted me -- out of my mind.

Yes, this is stupid policy and the Republicans deserve a huge amount of blame in this picture. But it was President Obama who decided to play deficit reduction games rather than be truthful about the state of the economy.Read Post | CommentsMichelangelo Signorile, 03/04/13Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesWhile many people are forced to be remain closeted in a still often homophobic society, the closet nonetheless should never be seen as a healthy place.

Just as it becomes difficult to force people to pay for content, which is no longer scarce, it also becomes impossible to force them to see advertising.Read Post | CommentsDevon Corneal, 03/04/13Lawyer, MotherWhen I think of what I genuinely want for these boys, happiness is not the first thing that comes to mind.

It keeps coming back. And so I\u0027ve decided to accept my illness in order to move on with my life. The problem is, once you make the decision to become \u0027frenemies\u0027 with your illness, you accept being defined by it, and cancer has a nasty reputation.Read Post | CommentsChris Abraham, 03/04/13Social Media and Digital Marketing and PR ConsultantEach and every opportunity we have to collaborate, entice, introduce, facilitate, and amplify the ideas and creations of the other -- to keep curious and engaged -- seems more than worthwhile to me.Read Post | CommentsPeter Diamandis, 03/04/13Chairman/CEO, X PRIZE FoundationMost Super Bowl commercials end up being unmemorable.
