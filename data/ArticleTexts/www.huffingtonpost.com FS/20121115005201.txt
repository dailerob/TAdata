{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Much of the discussion since the election has focused on what\u0027s wrong with Republicans -- why they misread the data, how they\u0027ll regroup and how the long-range demographics are increasingly against them. But more pressing is the fact that a new presidential term starts on January 21st with our country facing a myriad of urgent problems. President Obama still has the opportunity to have a transformational presidency -- but, as he has said again and again, bringing about the changes we need is going to require the active participation of all of us. So here\u0027s just a partial list of issues -- from foreclosures, drones and prisons to the drug war, climate change, and the voting process -- that need to be finally, and seriously, addressed in Obama\u0027s second term. We need to continue to push for all of these issues. It\u0027s up to citizens not just to elect presidents but to make them better.Read Post | Comments (96)David Bromwich, 11/14/12Professor of Literature at YaleThe largest hope of 2012 surely rests not with the president, but with those senators of political skill and passion who have been elected or reelected. They may give the party a backbone it has missed in recent years. For these are unembarrassed Democrats, none of them as immature as Obama was in 2008.Read Post | Comments (137)Gretchen W. McClain, 11.14.2012President and Chief Executive Officer, Xylem Inc.As the recent devastation from Hurricane Sandy has made tragically visible, our country\u0027s water infrastructure is in critical need of greater investments and modernization. And what better time to revitalize our infrastructure than now, in the wake of this month\u0027s elections -- with a second administration for the President and a new Congress on the way?Read Post | Comments (4)Geoffrey Dunn, 11/14/12Author, \u0027The Lies of Sarah Palin\u0027Obama has one move. He needs to call in Colin Powell to help him put out the escalating inferno and to restore both credibility and a sense of integrity to the military high command. Only Powell has both the status and the national-security gravitas to help Obama steady this dangerously rocking ship.Read Post | Comments (169)David Fontana, 11/14/12Associate Professor of Law at George Washington University School of Law in Washington, D.C.Presidents come and go, but federal judges stay. In the second term, it is important that President Obama find ways to focus his energies on judicial nominations, and find ways to ensure that the Senate does the same.Read Post | CommentsArt Brodsky, 11/14/12Internet activist and bloggerHas anyone seen a \"used\" e-book? No. Not a one. Because they don\u0027t exist. Every e-book purchased is a new e-book. The reason for that is that book publishers have come to control the market for e-books in a way that other industries envy.Read Post | CommentsSamantha Kemp-Jackson, 11/14/12Parenting writer \u0026 expert, media personality at www.multiplemayhemmamma.com \u0026 senior communications advisor at www.triplem.caWe\u0027ve all heard them. Those annoying phrases that our parents said to us growing up and now that we\u0027re parents ourselves, we\u0027ve decided to inflict them our own kids. The reality is that the true meanings behind these messages that parents tell their kids are often not as straightforward as they appear to be.Read Post | CommentsRobert Reich, 11/13/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The Congressional Budget Office and most independent economists say it will suck so much demand out of the economy that it will push us back into recession. That\u0027s the austerity trap of low growth, high unemployment, and falling government revenues Europe finds itself in. We don\u0027t want to go there.Read Post | Comments (302)Marcus Samuelsson, 11/14/12Chef and authorIf you need help getting creative with how to use your Thanksgiving leftovers, with the help of Food Republic I\u0027ve compiled my 10 favorite ways to make sure you\u0027re not wasting a thing this holiday season.Read Post | CommentsTavis Smiley, 11/14/12PBS talk show host, PRI radio hostThere is a line of folk wrapped around the White House who intend to collect on the Obama promissory note they\u0027ve been holding since 2008.

Gigolo doesn\u0027t really cover it. Lover, perhaps, but no newspaper account would use it in a situation like this because their goal is to talk about sex without directly mentioning it. Paramour? That just sounds ridiculous.Read Post | Comments (248)Jon Kamen and John Maeda, 11/13/12As we all know, STEM education is so important -- but on its own, sadly it\u0027s not working. Despite all of the resources being invested in it, the word is exactly what\u0027s wrong with the concept. It doesn\u0027t inspire, energize or engage the youth whom it is ultimately intended to benefit.
