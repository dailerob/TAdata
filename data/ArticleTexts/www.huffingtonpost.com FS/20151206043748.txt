{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Children\u0027s Defense FundWhile mass shootings grab fleeting public and policymaker attention we too often ignore the relentless everyday trauma of gun violence that snuffs out the lives of more American children and teens every four days than the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School. How can we remain numb to the day in and day out cries of children and others robbed of their childhoods, robbed of their lives, or scarred for life by guns and bullets we have the power but not the decency, courage, and will to stop? Dr. King warned us that America may go to hell if we didn\u0027t deal with the violence of poverty in his last Sunday sermon. I am sure he would say we were going to go to hell as well today if we don\u0027t stop the violence of guns that is ravaging our families and communities and terrifying our children. We must act to save our country\u0027s soul.Muslims denounce both terrorism and radical Islam. \"Moderate\" is a misleading modifier for a religion that rejects the killing of innocent people, women and children, old people, and those fleeing combat. And the Quran is clear: there is no compulsion in matters of religion.Brooks College and Kaufman Interfaith Institute, Grand Valley State UniversityWhether motivated by delusions of white supremacy, or lies about the content of a video purporting to sell fetus body parts, or a gross distortions of religion: these crimes are the same; the victims are the same; and the shock and loss of security experienced by the rest of us are the same.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027At a time when major presidential candidates demonize difference, and when attackers respond to groups they\u0027ve been inspired to hate with terrorism, let\u0027s recognize the constructive value of ongoing debate and that politicized campuses remain places of confrontation and of real learning.President, Wesleyan UniversityAvoid the crowds at the mall this holiday season. The very best gifts come from your own kitchen. These cookies are all guaranteed to make your friends, neighbors and teachers smile. The only challenge will be keeping yourself and your family from gobbling them up straight out of the oven!Chef, Recipe Developer and Busy MomThere was a story that happened yesterday that you probably did not hear about. It happened in Boston between the Prudential and Copley train stations. A man who seemed \"off\" had been staring at my friend since she got on at the Longwood Medical Area stop.Researcher at Harvard Medical SchoolWhile I was never a party animal anyways, completely stopping with alcohol made me go out even less. It\u0027s amazing to see the culture of drinking slowly fading away from your life. It made me realize how many friendships are actually based mostly on your drinking habits.Designer \u0026 Maker. Former Design Lead, SpotifyWe do not know who will next be taken in by toxic ideology and turn into a terrorist. You cannot spot a terrorist by religion, gender, income, or marital status. For once, the right and most advantageous responses coincide. Treat each person with a skeptical, rebuttable presumption of innocence.Science and Religion Correspondent for the Humanist MagazineWe need to separate from the Palestinians. Not for them, for us. But that separation needs to be based on strict security measures and take into account the worst case scenarios.Knesset Member and Chairperson of Yesh AtidFor too long the Burmese people could only look to the future and hope for change. Today they have a chance to enjoy the opportunities that the rest of us take for granted. Hopefully now, after decades of conflict, the future finally has arrived for Burma.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteI love the beginnings of a startup. I enjoy the process of finding an idea and creating something from scratch. I don\u0027t care if it\u0027s going to fail or not. It\u0027s the adventure and the learnings that matter. The feeling of doing something new no-one else is doing yet.Serial entrepreneur co-founder of LeWeb and business angel in LinkedIn, Evernote and Lending Club.The IAEA\u0027s \"Final Report\" is more a political face-saving exercise than technical expose. Fortunately, reason prevailed, and the PMD case against Iran has run its course, not with the bang anticipated by its supporters, but rather a whisper.Author, \u0027Dangerous Ground\u0027\"Our No. 1 goal for the next year is to put together a complete alternative to the left\u0027s agenda,\" said Paul Ryan as he unveiled his agenda. Despite the speech\u0027s sweeping oratory and careful stagecraft, Ryan clings to seven dumb ideas that are also cropping up among Republican presidential candidates.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027There are family obligations at the holidays, but not every obligation need be met, especially if they cause sadness, resentment, or regret. Whether or not you have someone in your life struggling with mental illness, you\u0027re only as helpful as you are healthy yourself.Author, research psychologist and gender scholar\"Thoughts and prayers\" are not solutions for the 30,000 people who will be killed by a gun this year -- we need sensible gun safety legislation NOW.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersI remember asking the guy documenting casualties about the number of wounded and finding out it had reached 46, all women and children. I was stunned. For the first time ever, there was not a single man among those injured during an air strike.We are non-violent Syrian activists campaigning to engage people around the world in solidarity to stop the violence and extremism in Syria.Justice -- of sorts -- was finally delivered as Donald Blankenship, the former Chairman and CEO of Massey Energy, was convicted of conspiring to willfully violate mine safety standards at the Upper Branch Mine in West Virginia, where 29 workers died in April 2010. Here\u0027s a blog I wrote about it a few months after the disaster.Instead of asking, or even begging, corporations and countries to please reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in Paris, we would like to follow The Pope\u0027s lead and suggest that there is a simpler, more effective and more just way to deal with the existential threat facing life on this planet.Composer, singer, actor and activistCommunication Strategist, Author of \"Words That Shook The World\"Democratic Senator from Rhode IslandSinger and songwriterWhile soft spots remain in the job market and we are not at full employment, we are clearly on that path, as payrolls have settled into a steady growth groove, slightly north of 200,000 per month.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorPrayer alone cannot fix these troubled and dangerous times. Nor can prayer be used by politicians -- or any of us -- to excuse inaction or to demonstrate one\u0027s compassion, while continuing to support gun policies that will only allow more shootings.President, Auburn Theological SeminaryWe cannot be sure what would happen after a U.S. pull-out. But we know that ISIS needs us. Without the American presence, it loses its ability to market itself as the Islamic champion against the Western neo-crusaders. The anti-war movement is long overdue.Jeff Faux, author of The Servant EconomyGun ownership isn\u0027t some inalienable right granted by God. Remember, the Constitution was written by men coming out of a long and bloody war near the end of the 18th century. It was written for their time. It also included the \"right\" to own a human being. Things change.Comedian; author of \"DC Trip\" (Adaptive Books)On November 24, 2015 the General Assembly of the United Nations passed six anti-Israeli resolutions -- in one day. Some of them relate to issues that should be addressed: Occupation, settlement building, Palestinian rights, peace. But the text of each and every one is outrageous.Author, \u0027My Promised Land: The Triumph and Tragedy of Israel\u0027It turns out that Sanders does have a detailed corporate tax plan to pay for his infrastructure plan. He introduced the plan as a Senate bill shortly before announcing his run for the Democratic nomination for President. It is called the Corporate Tax Dodging Prevention Act.Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureNot a single Syrian has been at the negotiating table -- despite repeated assurances that any future transition would be Syria-led and Syrian-owned. We want protection from the barrel bombs, cluster munitions and chemical weapons that suffocate, maim and kill our children. Unless the participants at Vienna recognize and act on our calls for civilian protection, talks will lack legitimacy and will not secure peace.Coalition of Syrian civil society groups, inside and outside SyriaIn between consultations, the doctor comes out, smiles and makes jokes with the children. \"The biggest problem for them is the lack of safe places to play, and the lack of toys, which families often can\u0027t afford. \"President of Un Ponte PerThe recent shooting of a Venezuela opposition politician and its aftermath are worth examining because it provides a compelling example of how international media has been manipulated, for over 15 years, to portray Venezuela in a way that conforms to U.S. foreign policy objectives.Co-director, Center for Economic and Policy Research, Washington, D.C.Gun violence, Islamic terrorism, and anti-Muslim bigotry are all real, serious problems that need to be faced head-on. It\u0027s disingenuous to be in denial about one or the other just because you have a certain political affiliation.Pakistani-Canadian writer, physician and musicianLakeshore Records digitally releases Brooklyn: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack today, December 4th. The classic track is performed by music coordinator John Carty with James Blennerhassettt, Paul Gurney and Jim Higgins.Trafficbeat Entertainment, Music Biz VetYou can just decide that beauty isn\u0027t important. And when you do, it\u0027s OK that some days you just cannot be positive. Some days you can just live in your body and give yourself space to be not ok at all. It\u0027s completely ok to look in the mirror and be sad that your stomach is a curtain for your pubic hair.Feminist, body positive, wife, mom of five, Editor In Chief at ravishly.com, (sometimes) RN.I am a Christian and an American, but I refuse to settle for this American Christianity any longer or be defined by it.
