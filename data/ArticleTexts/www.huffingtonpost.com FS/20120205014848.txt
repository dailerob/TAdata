{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, America\u0027s poor, a group largely neglected by politicians, was front and center in the national conversation. On the one hand, we had President Obama speaking at the National Prayer Breakfast, invoking \"the biblical call to care for... those at the margins of our society\" and paraphrasing Luke in support of tax hikes on the wealthy (Question: Why would the Good Book have something relevant to say about taxes only now, but not when the president extended tax cuts for those \"to whom much is given\"?). On the same day as the Prayer Breakfast, Mitt Romney was accepting the endorsement of the gold-plated Donald Trump -- only one day after saying he was \"not concerned about the very poor.\" Could you be more politically tone-deaf? They probably bonded over their mutual love of pink slips: Mitt: I like being able to fire people! Donald: I tried to trademark \"You\u0027re fired!\" Mitt: Glad you couldn\u0027t -- I would have owed you a lot of royalties!Read Post | CommentsDavid Bromwich, 2/2/12Professor of Literature at YaleIran is headed to become for Obama in 2012 what the economy was in 2010: a controllable crisis which, through personal inaction and a conventional acquiescence in failed policies, threatens to pass utterly beyond his control.Read Post | Comments (1,261)Ricky Gervais, 2/3/12Actor, writer, comedian, director, producer\"Fame\" used to be fused with \"respect\" in some ways. That\u0027s what distinguished it from infamy. But not anymore.Read Post | Comments (110)Arianna Huffington, 2/2/12As amazing as this last year has been for the AOL Huffington Post Media Group, we have even bigger plans moving ahead: more sections, more international editions, more original reporting, more ways of making the site -- and the stories we cover -- social.Read Post | Comments (71)Bill Moyers and Michael Winship, 1/30/12A week or so ago, we read about what in the Gilded Age of the Roman Empire was known as a bacchanal -- a big blowout at which the imperial swells got together and whooped it up. This one occurred here in Manhattan at the annual black-tie dinner and induction ceremony for Kappa Beta Phi.Read Post | Comments (117)Julianne Moore, 2/1/12ActressValentine\u0027s Day has become a major children\u0027s holiday, and is for them, about friendship. So if we parents have to buy Valentines anyway, why not send the money to children and schools less fortunate than our own?Read Post | Comments (66)Dr. Phil McGraw, 2/3/12Author, Host \"Dr. Phil\"Super Bowl Sunday. For most men, it makes their year. Unfortunately, for too many, the year ends the day after. PFDS, Post Football Depression Syndrome sets in and sets in with a vengeance.Read Post | Comments (80)Charles Ferguson, 2/4/12Director of the Wall Street documentary \u0027Inside Job\u0027; Author of the forthcoming book, \u0027Predator Nation\u0027Over the intervening three years, what did Obama do? Well, we got a stimulus package, and then a year later an absurdly complicated new law that addressed everything except the most important issues. And that\u0027s about it.Read Post | Comments (256)Jennifer Garner, 2/2/12Actress; Save the Children Artist AmbassadorKids should never have to experience any kind of poverty in this country -- neither the more hopeful kind my mom experienced during the dustbowl depression, nor the kind the kids in West Virginia and Yucca face today. Let\u0027s make nearly one in four in poverty become none in four.Read Post | Comments (170)Mark Ruffalo, 2/2/12Actor/DirectorCompassion is within us innately as a people and as a nation. So put aside the rhetoric and ask yourself: how much more than enough do you need? Whatever that amount is, there is always a little bit more left over for those who don\u0027t have even close to enough.Read Post | Comments (167)Cecile Richards, 2/1/12President, Planned Parenthood Action FundThe news this week that the Susan G. Komen for the Cure Foundation, after years of pressure from political groups, will end its support of lifesaving breast cancer screening at Planned Parenthood health centers comes as a blow to women across America.Read Post | Comments (1,405)Lord Weidenfeld of Chelsea, 2/3/12Founder and chairman of Weidenfeld \u0026 NicolsonWho are the incubators of a real democratic renewal in the Arab Spring? After talking to young Egyptians, among them many intellectuals, who returned to their homeland having studied at prestigious English universities, I feel confronted with a rather contradictory picture.Read Post | Comments (18)Marlo Thomas, 2/3/12Award-winning actress, author, and activistHere are some recipes for game grub sure to please the football viewers, innocent bystanders or anyone else who -- like us -- may well be found in the kitchen relishing a good ole \u0027bowl of red.\u0027Read Post | Comments (54)Antonio Banderas, 2/2/12ActorWhen it comes to the Golden Collar Awards race, how could not only Puss, but all felines, be shut out? Cats wear collars too.Read Post | Comments (93)Barbra Streisand, 2/3/12Singer; Actress; Director; Composer; ActivistThe electorate assumes that presidential candidates will embellish, evade, and even sidestep tough questions. But the media must draw the line when candidates rewrite history in order to protect or enhance their own self-image, not based on the truth.Read Post | Comments (750)Marty Kaplan, 1/30/12Director, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolThe breadth and depth of the information we\u0027re casually volunteering is fueling a burgeoning industry. But no one who\u0027s planning to make money off that data seems to be offering us equity in Big Brother, Inc. in exchange for X-raying our identities.Read Post | Comments (11)Robin Bronk, 2/2/12CEO, The Creative CoalitionWhether one agrees with the views expressed in Fox\u0027s films or not, we should all agree that citizens have a right to know and tell other citizens what our elected officials are doing. We shouldn\u0027t be arresting documentary filmmakers in America for filming public hearings.Read Post | Comments (225)Al Gore, 2/1/12Chairman, Current TVAcidifying oceans, a result of the same carbon dioxide pollution that is warming our planet, is a problem of multiple dimensions.Read Post | Comments (255)Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, 1/30/12U.S. Senator from New YorkThe American people deserve to know that their elected leaders play by the exact same rules that they play by and that their lawmakers\u0027 only interest is what\u0027s best for the country, not their own financial gain.Read Post | Comments (204)Randy Jackson, 2/1/12Grammy Award winning producerIn a country as wealthy as ours, why do we allow childhood poverty? How can we expect all our kids to succeed when almost a quarter of our kids don\u0027t have the basic tools of life, like books to read and food that helps them growth strong and healthy?Read Post | Comments (120)Rider Strong, 1/31/12Actor; FilmmakerHypnotized by the cost and convenience of the form, I\u0027m afraid Hollywood -- and in response, audiences -- are forgetting that an emphasis on setting and character is precisely the point of the mockumentary. It is, in fact, the only point.Read Post | Comments (19)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 1/31/12Author, \u0027Our Fathers Ourselves. Daughters, Fathers, And The Changing American Family\u0027What is it about women that the men of deeply conservative religions find so threatening? What runs so deep that it justifies traumatizing an innocent eight-year-old like Naama Margolese in Beit Shemesh?Read Post | Comments (1,553)Jon Soltz, 2/2/12Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranMitt Romney just made it clear: While the president will begin to transition us out of Afghanistan, a President Mitt Romney would keep us there in an open-ended commitment.Read Post | Comments (69)Evan Shapiro, 1/31/12President, IFCThe more \"talent\" shows we get each season, the less \"talented\" is each slate of competitors forced upon our screens, airwaves and eardrums. We are spreading our talent too thinly across too many shows and it\u0027s doing long-lasting damage to the genre.Read Post | Comments (105)Trey Ellis, 2/1/12Novelist, Screenwriter, and Associate Professor at Columbia UniversityPresident Gingrich, as soon as Air Force One touched down on my hot, tropical tarmac I shuddered. I knew that I was lost. As the gleaming jet\u0027s door opened and you stood there on the top of the stairs, your ermine robe jauntily draped over your adorably hunched soft shoulders.Read Post | Comments (23)Oren Moverman, 2/2/12Academy Award nominated filmmakerOne fall, as I was talking with the LAPD and trying to get into their heads, one white cop leaning confidently on his idled squad car took his time explaining to me that the battle for the streets of Los Angeles.Read Post | Comments (71)Danielle Crittenden, 2012. 5.02Arianna Huffington, 2012. 5.02Christie Russell, 2012. 4.02Ryan Doyle, 2012. 4.02Jane Siberry, 2012. 4.02Gordy Grundy, 2012. 4.02Carla Buzasi, 2012. 4.02Scott Mendelson, 2012. 4.02William Astore, 2012. 4.02Michael Shank, 2012. 4.02","h1":"Using a mobile device?
