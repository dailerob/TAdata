{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOThere are a lot of things to ridicule about Sarah Palin\u0027s incomprehensible speaking style and backwards, simplistic views on the issues. But it\u0027s her politics of fear and division that must be wholly rejected on Tuesday because it\u0027s practically too terrible to imagine waking up one week from today in an America that rewards the awfulness and fear she and her allies rely upon.

She might not be able to stitch together a declarative sentence but she sure knows how to fight back.Read Post | CommentsBIOKeith Thomson, 10.29.2008There\u0027s no time like the present to reflect on a system that allows a candidate to gain office regardless of the popular will.Read Post | Comments (80)BIOBilly Kimball, 10.29.2008It appeals to my vanity to believe, as Maureen Dowd and Sarah Palin do, that we are living in the End of Days; but the facts suggest that the American Century may very well give way to the American Millennium.Read Post | Comments (11)BIOHenry Blodget, 10.29.2008What will happen if the global economy plunges into a second Great Depression, as some economists suggest? If that happens stocks will probably drop at least another 50% from here.Read Post | Comments (19)BIOJim Wallis, 10.29.2008\"Honorable\" is not the first word that will be used in describing the McCain strategy in the final stage. McCain made a mistake not to run on his vision as a different kind of Republican.Read Post | Comments (57)BIORobert Creamer, 10.29.2008Undecided voters may very well break for John McCain and Sarah Palin.
