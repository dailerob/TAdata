{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027The Fix the Debt strategy was explicitly to wait until after the election. They would then go into high gear pushing their agenda of cutting Social Security and Medicare regardless of who won the elections. Remember, we need these cuts because they say so. It is worth repeating the \"they say so\" part because this is the only way we could know that cuts to Social Security and Medicare are necessary. It is possible to tell stories about countries where a meltdown in financial markets forced sharp budget cuts, but there is zero evidence of that for the United States. Investors are willing to lend the U.S. government vast amounts of money at extremely low interest rates. The only reason that we have for believing that financial markets will panic if we don\u0027t have the Social Security and Medicare cuts the Debt Fixers want is because they say so. For this reason, it is worth considering what the Debt Fixers know or don\u0027t know about the economy.Read Post | Comments (361)Robert Reich, 12/11/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027As money concentrates at the top, so does power.

The result has been a degree of inequality not witnessed since the days of the robber barons.Read Post | Comments (335)Marlo Thomas, 12/11/12Award-winning actress, author and activistDuring the holiday season, huge amounts of planning and effort go into the big holiday dinners that we all love so much.

Stammering only raises those (cute) little antennae. But there is nothing quite so stressful as aiming for mellow.Read Post | Comments (38)Trey Ellis, 12/11/12Novelist, Screenwriter, and Associate Professor at Columbia UniversityI was as worried as I was delighted when I heard Quentin Tarantino\u0027s next film would be a slave-narrative-cum-spaghetti-western. Now, for making the funniest, most-energizing, complicated, brilliant and uplifting action-adventure about a slave turned folk hero, Tarantino has more than earned his black card.Read Post | Comments (280)Rabbi Daniel Brenner, 12/11/12Chief of Education and Program, Moving TraditionsLast year before Christmas I got a Facebook message from my church-going high school sweetheart.
