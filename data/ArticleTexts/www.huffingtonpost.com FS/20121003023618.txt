{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"On the eve of the first presidential debate, the focus shouldn\u0027t be on who is going to \"win,\" but on whether we are finally going to get a serious debate on jobs and the economy. But I don\u0027t expect much, especially given reports the Romney team believes that \"debates are about creating moments\" and thus \"equipped him with a series of zingers that he has memorized.\" Now, a well-placed debate zinger certainly has its place -- but how much more of a \"moment\" would be created if either candidate instead unleashed a series of proposals to put the twenty million Americans who are unemployed or underemployed back to work? In fact, the pipeline is full of legislative proposals that would help put Americans back to work. But time is running out. If that debate doesn\u0027t happen, then the loser of all three debates will be the American people.Read Post | Comments (30)Jerome Karabel, 10/02/12Professor of Sociology, University of California at BerkeleyThe United States now finds itself at a crossroads: still fervently committed to the American dream, but unwilling to adopt policies that would promote its realization. Put simply, Republicans and Democrats alike want something they cannot have.Read Post | Comments (18)Dr. Linda Arnold, 10.01.2012Associate Professor of Pediatrics, Yale School of MedicineThere are many places in the world where parents dare not select their babies\u0027 names in advance. It\u0027s not that these parents love their children less than we do, it\u0027s because they know there is a good chance their babies will die.Read Post | Comments (3)Howard Fineman, 10/02/12Editorial Director, Huffington Post Media GroupIf you want hope and change in politics, mayors offer tons of it. The key to success in their jobs, they say, is to avoid -- as indeed they do -- partisan bickering and focus on What Works.Read Post | Comments (12)Arianna Huffington, 10/01/12With 36 days until the presidential election, I\u0027m delighted to introduce Firsthand, a project that uses all the tools at our disposal to expand the conversation, puts the spotlight on what really matters most in people\u0027s lives and allows you to share the ideas and images that tell the story of our country during this campaign season, as you see it.Read Post | Comments (119)Patricia Cornwell, 10/02/12If President Obama is reelected, and I hope he is, maybe he should take a close look at those his administration appoints to serve the public objectively and without conflict or unseemly allegiances. And maybe it\u0027s time to hold financial institutions accountable for their greed and questionable practices.Read Post | Comments (11)Jim Wallis, 10/02/12Christian leader for social changeTomorrow night is the first presidential debate.

But whose lives will it be important to?Read Post | CommentsRashard Mendenhall, 10/02/12Running back, Pittsburgh SteelersI think our pride becomes a problem because our natural tendency is to side with people that think like us, act like us and agree with us. At the same time we push away people who disagree with us, challenge us, question what we believe, or just don\u0027t see things the way that we do.Read Post | CommentsEvan Shapiro, 10/02/12President, Participant TelevisionNews Flash: People are wasting a lot of time online.

This heightened understanding can bring our children support, respect and empathy.Read Post | Comments (25)Vicki Larson, 10/02/12Journalist, mother, thinkerMost of us marry with the best of intentions. Sometimes that just doesn\u0027t work out. We shouldn\u0027t slap a #fail label on people who divorce.
