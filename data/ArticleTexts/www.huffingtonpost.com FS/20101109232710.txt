{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"I\u0027ve always thought that, as a country, we do a lousy job of addressing how we can do divorce differently -- and better. Especially when there are children involved. That\u0027s why I\u0027m so excited about the launch of HuffPost Divorce. Inspired by HuffPost editor-at-large Nora Ephron, who knows a thing or two about the subject (see Heartburn), our newest section will tackle the topic from many angles, providing insight, resources, community, and some comic relief to those impacted by what Nora, in her new book, calls the Big D. Our goal is to produce a fast, fearless, highly interactive guide to the profound changes divorce brings. So whether you are divorced, divorcing, or just curious about how others manage the complexities of divorce, check out HuffPost Divorce. Breaking up is hard to do... but reading about it isn\u0027t. Let us know what you think.Read Post | CommentsNora Ephron, 11.08.2010Author; Editor At Large, Huffington PostThe most important thing about me, for quite a long chunk of my life, was that I was divorced. Even after I was no longer divorced but remarried, this was true.Read Post | CommentsJoan Walsh, 11.09.2010You\u0027ve probably heard the news: I\u0027m stepping down from editorial management at Salon. But I\u0027m certainly not leaving -- too many headlines used that shorthand to say I\u0027m giving up my editing job.Read Post | CommentsLeo Hindery, Jr., 11.09.2010Chairman, U.S. Economy/Smart Globalization Initiative at the New America FoundationSo, where should Democrats go next? How about to the three economic initiatives where bipartisan support is achievable and which would go a long way to putting some real juice in our now jobless recovery?Read Post | CommentsTrey Ellis, 11.08.2010Novelist, Screenwriter, and Assistant Professor at Columbia UniversityWhat the White House still seems to have forgotten, even after the recent \"shellacking,\" is that we elected a commander-in-chief, not mediator-in-chief. A mediator rarely offers his own opinions but steers both sides toward civility.Read Post | CommentsBernard-Henri Lévy, 11.08.2010French philosopher and writerWe are now nearing the moment when, from little arrangements to great back-downs, from cultural concessions to totalitarian power grabs, the United Nations institution itself will be ready for the scrap heap.Read Post | CommentsLee Camp, 11.09.2010Comedian featured in new bestselling book \"Satiristas!\" \u0026 www.LeeCamp.netWhat did President Bush\u0027s memoir look like before the ghostwriter took a stab at it?

Just as kids need rituals most, when they are the most fragile and insecure, a great stabilizer like family dinner is often the first thing to go.Read Post | CommentsLisa Turner, 11.09.2010inspiredeating.com/Dieting tricks don\u0027t work because they don\u0027t explore the underlying issues, the mental and emotional side of eating. And the holidays, more than any other time, are fraught with emotions.Read Post | CommentsSeth Shostak, 11.09.2010Senior Astronomer, SETI InstituteA generous slice of the citizenry thinks we might be the cleverest creatures in the Milky Way. But the suggestion that we\u0027re a special case makes me uneasy. It implies our existence is a miracle, and after all, miracles are science\u0027s last resort.Read Post | CommentsKathleen Reardon, 11.08.2010Professor, USC Marshall School, and author of \u0027Comebacks at Work\u0027I waited last night for the confident Democratic President of the United States to appear on 60 Minutes but he never quite arrived. It appears to me that Obama is engaged in \"strategic ambiguity.\"Read Post | CommentsScott Mendelson, 11.09.2010Film Critic and Pundit for Salon, Huffington Post, and Mendelson\u0027s MemosDespite the token entertainment value and the nostalgia that\u0027s sure to come from seeing all of your favorite heroes being given a token mention, Secret Origins: the Story of DC Comics is shockingly uninformative.Read Post | CommentsKaren Kelly, 11.09.2010Food and health writerIt\u0027s okay to sit with your kids at dinner, to take them out with you.
