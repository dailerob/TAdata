{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, the White House rolled out Harriet Miers version 1.2, Tom DeLay smiled for the mug shot cameras (call it a “smugshot”), and Judy Miller revealed a heretofore undetected sense of humor when she accepted a First Amendment Award on Tuesday. Check out some of the best of this week\u0027s blogs below, plus must-read takes on Plamegate from Jane Hamsher, Jay Rosen, Martin Garbus, Rep. John Conyers, and David Wallechinsky (you can catch up on my latest Miller/Plame posts here). And don’t miss Jonah Peretti on a hilarious White House want ad.THROWING MILLER AND LIBBY OVERBOARD IS NOT ENOUGHREAD POST | comments10.22.2005 RJ EskowAn overview of the greatest hits from (New York Times\u0027 public editor) Byron Calame\u0027s just-released piece on Judy Miller:One ethical problem emerged when...READ POST | comments10.22.2005 Jeralyn MerrittIf Karl Rove, as I suspect, drove the final nail in Libby\u0027s coffin during his four and one-half hour testimony ten days ago, I think Libby has no choice but to fall on his sword for Cheney and plead guilty.READ POST | comments (15)10.21.2005 Michael IsikoffThe real story of last weekend\u0027s Judy Miller revelations is how Libby clearly and unequivocally misrepresented the contents of the classified National Intelligence Estimate.READ POST | comments (30)10.21.2005 Lawrence O\u0027DonnellWill Fitzgerald issue indictments? No, he won’t. The most Fitzgerald will do is ask his grand jury to issue indictments. It’s really all up to them. Which raises the question: who are they?READ POST | comments (49)10.18.2005 Nora EphronOne thing I want to say about Harriet Miers (whom we were not speaking of) is that my intuition about her is that she does not scream at her assistants. That\u0027s probably the only thing Miers won\u0027t be accused of on her way to the Supreme Court.READ POST | comments (19)10.18.2005 Ari EmanuelWhen it comes to dealing with the problems that have plagued his presidency, Bush has repeatedly been caught with his pants down (in a much worse way than the previous occupant of the White House).READ POST | comments (18)10.19.2005 James MooreWatergate, by comparison, was a random burglary in an age of innocence.READ POST | comments (167)10.21.2005 Norman LearGiven her religious persuasion, Harriet Miers should have no problem sighting and accepting a sign of intelligent resign.READ POST | comments10.21.2005 Bill DiamondIncreasingly desperate for a \"bullhorn moment\" to rescue his foundering second term, Pres.
