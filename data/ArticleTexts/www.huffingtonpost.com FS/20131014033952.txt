{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Bruce AckermanProfessor of law and political science, Yale; Author \u0027The Decline and Fall of the American Republic\u0027While the Republican House leadership continues to talk tough, the moderate majority has taken a first big step toward undermining its position. On Saturday, more than 100 Democrats signed a petition discharging a bill from the Rules Committee that would force an up-or-down vote on a \"clean\" continuing resolution that would reopen the government with no strings attached. Since the Democrats are in the minority, this might seem a symbolic gesture. This is why a recent announcement by Representative Peter King is genuinely important. He is the first Republican to threaten publicly to buck the leadership and join the effort to force a vote.Comments (18)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundExtremist Republicans continue to hold funding for the federal government hostage for the second week in a row, opposing a clean extension of government funding without conditions. Their actions are harming the economy and countless real children and families across the country.Comments (306)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Keeping the government running and paying the nation\u0027s bills should never have been bargaining chits in the first place, and the President and Democrats shouldn\u0027t begin to negotiate over future budgets until they\u0027re taken off the table.Comments (141)Steven StraussAdjunct Lecturer in Public Policy, Harvard Kennedy SchoolResidents of the 10 American states with highest support for the Norquist Pledge have shorter life expectancies than those in the 10 states with least support for the Pledge. So it seems appropriate to ask -- is the Norquist small government philosophy bad for your health?CommentsWait But Whywww.waitbutwhy.comA Facebook status is annoying if it primarily serves the author and does nothing positive for anyone reading it.CommentsPaul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostThe themes and speakers at VVS2013 have the whiff of decayed ideas and diminished power. But the really horrible part of the event is the complete and utter lack of interest in the poor, the immigrants, and those on the margins -- you know, those people Jesus loved.Comments (628)Emma BrodieWriterI hit an invisible wall and the music came to an abrupt halt. Off clattered the headphones of youthful naiveté (previously unnoticed by me). I wasn\u0027t in a story at all, I was in the East Village and that smell was pee.CommentsMike WeisserMike the Gun GuyI\u0027m suggesting that we go block by block, again and again, to make sure that people know about the epidemic called gun violence. It\u0027s spread by a virus called guns, and as long as young men between 15 and 30 believe they are immune to it, the epidemic will continue to spread.CommentsOliver TearleAuthor; Lecturer in English, Loughborough Univ.Sometimes authors don\u0027t shuffle off this mortal coil quietly or -- for want of a better word -- normally. Sometimes they meet a sticky and untimely end, and sometimes myths build up around an author\u0027s demise and we come to accept legend as fact.CommentsTom KrattenmakerAuthor, \u0027The Evangelicals You Don\u0027t Know\u0027Pro football has a serious morality problem. I am not talking about promiscuous players or racist team nicknames. Nor am I referring to the \"obscene\" amounts of money changing hands between the masses obsessed with football and the sports industrial complex that keeps them supplied.Comments (18)Jeff DanzigerPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideComments (16)Rep. Keith EllisonCo-chair, Congressional Progressive Caucus; U.S. Representative for Minnesota\u0027s 5th DistrictIt takes 86 hours a week working in a minimum wage job to pay for an average two-bedroom apartment in Minnesota. That\u0027s 12 hours a day, seven days a week. It\u0027s no accident that real wages have declined while executive pay and corporate profits have climbed rapidly.CommentsKatie HalperCo-founder, Laughing LiberallyWell played, James Woods. You have cast yourself as a martyr -- and the president and liberals as villains responsible for your stalled career.CommentsSteve RosenbaumCEO, Magnify.net; author, \u0027Curation Nation\u0027; NYC entrepreneur at largeThe cure for information overload is coherent curation -- data-driven discovery managed by skilled, thoughtful, and in some cases expert curators. Much as the quality of a restaurant is created by the chef, the quality of the curated end-product is going to be made by the curator.CommentsBrian KrewsonR\u0026D engineer; bloggerImagine the company you work for held a poll and asked everyone if they thought it would be a good idea to put a soda machine in the break room. Some said no, but the majority said yes. So, a week later, there\u0027s a soda machine. Now imagine that Bill in accounting voted against the soda machine.Comments (164)Stephen HerringtonThe Monday Morning EconomistThe bald-faced irony of how the Tea Party wants to exorcise debt from government is that in the way they are choosing to do it they are causing the exact same economic carnage that they ostensibly fear.Comments (33)Alexandra MolotkowSenior editor, Hazlitt MagazineIn life, people place demands on people, and people place demands on themselves, and everyone has to work really hard to keep everyone happy. When there\u0027s a whole pizza in front of you, though, everything else ceases to exist.CommentsSean McElweeWriterUnlike other reforms, which would improve the U.S. political system (campaign-finance reform, more earmarks, open primaries, a shortened campaign season, redistricting reform, actual journalism) or scrap it all together, \"term limits\" would do nil to make our political system better.CommentsJanice HarperAnthropologistThere is another chapter to Ken Perenyi\u0027s life that was omitted from his autobiography, and that is the chapter of how he used his ill-gotten gains to rescue a child from sex slavery and, as the FBI closed in on his forging escapades, found himself an unexpected parent to a Ghanian child.CommentsDavid PaulPresident, Fiscal Strategies GroupThe arrogant claims to fiscal rectitude of the Tea Party belie the underlying realities. They are not the makers of their own imagination, but are rather in large numbers the takers that they have been so quick to disdain.Comments (190)Don McNaybest selling author, CEO \u0026 Chairman RRP International PublishingThe stories usually stopped when James was 22 years old. They missed the great story of what James accomplished after sports ended and business life began. He built one of the most successful structured settlement and settlement planning firms in the United States.CommentsDogsterAn online community for dogs and the dog owners who love themWe did everything possible to give Crosby a good life. He had some health problems, and he had behavior problems -- he was extremely unruly. We took him to obedience class. I had reservations but never gave up on him. He challenged us in every way.CommentsWilliam BradleyPolitical AnalystLast weekend, in the midst of all the tumult over the debacle that is the federal government shutdown, came word of these two dramatic US special operations forces raids against jihadist leaders in Libya and Somalia.Comments (19)Steve MariottiFounder, Network for Teaching EntrepreneurshipSerena\u0027s path has been full of struggle, and I want to share her story to help other young adults see the impact of not graduating from school, financial struggle, and drug abuse on even the brightest young entrepreneurs.CommentsChris Harnick, 2013.13.10Mike Weisser, 2013.13.10Michael Calderone, 2013.13.10Wait But Why, 2013.13.10Joe Peyronnin, 2013.13.10Katie Halper, 2013.13.10Mercedes Schneider, 2013.13.10HuffPost Radio, 2013.13.10David Finkle, 2013.13.10Lisa Mirza Grotts, 2013.13.10Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"SENATE \u0027COMPROMISE\u0027 BACK FROM THE DEAD!
