{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Fmr. U.S. Ambassador to Belgium and now Managing Partner of The Gutman GroupThe low groans and shrill yelps coming from the Republican establishment and editorial pages around the country suggest that Donald Trump is a train wreck that will continue to run amok right through to the Republican nomination before slamming into the wall of a Hillary Clinton rout, leaving the Republican Party splattered by the side of the track. Perhaps. But perhaps Donald Trump has saved the Republican Party from its potentially slow and steady decline into that same abyss. Not only did Trump clear the field of any Republican who would carry the McCain-Romney demographic nightmare legacy, but, in so doing, he achieved the unimaginable: he turned the first-term Cuban Senator Rubio into a Republican establishment darling. A standard-bearer.Welcome to yet another manufactured media feud that is needed to feed websites and empty air time.Model, designer, an author, businesswoman, public speakerThis farce has gone on too long. The sophomoric Republican debates have gone from bad to worse and last night\u0027s \"Cock Fight\" debate simply catapulted the candidates even further down in the credibility and respectability department. This is about electing a leader, not about the size of anyone\u0027s manhood. Stick to talking about politics, policies and your stance on national and international issues.Managing Editor of Blogs, Huffington Post CanadaAlthough some measure of judicial restraint is essential to the legitimacy of constitutional interpretation, even conservatives recognize that judicial restraint in all cases would seriously abdicate a fundamental responsibility that the Framers themselves entrusted to the judiciary.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoAlan Grayson, the liberal champion of the House, the member of Congress with the largest base of small donors, the Congressman who passed more legislation than anyone other Representative, is again in the news. And not because he\u0027s eleven points ahead in the polls to be the Democratic nominee for Marco Rubio\u0027s Senate Seat in Florida.Attorney, writerThe political class is awash in self-serving theories to explain the rise of Donald Trump. While some of these theories can explain portions of Trump\u0027s appeal they are not the whole story. These are age-old grievances.Immigration Policy Analyst, Cato Institute\u0027s Center for Global Liberty and ProsperityIf the government has its way, then it will have won the authority to turn American tech companies against their customers and, in the process, undercut decades of advances in our security and privacy.Ford Foundation Fellow, ACLU’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology ProjectThe media can act shocked about Trump failing to quickly and very clearly denounce David Duke and the KKK and their support for him, but they didn\u0027t seriously ask the more important question: Why do the advocates of white supremacy like and advocate for Donald Trump?Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersThe Harvard Gazette has released a series of articles on inequality in America. They describe Harvard University scholars’ efforts across a range of disciplines to identify and understand this nation-defining and dividing concern and possible solutions.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundTake it from a sleep expert who understands the importance of sleep. Ditch these common sleep myths, and you\u0027ll be sure to see improvements in your overall health and mood.Writer, photographer and weight loss success story who prefers to see the glass half full.Our common dream is the only antidote to the common nightmare already in the works. But to become an effective antidote we need to join forces. We need to overcome the usual tendency of progressives to fall prey to the sirens of discord.Former Finance Minister of GreeceNow, I am a science writer, not a political pundit. To my eyes, Donald as tumor is a more apt metaphor than the party leadership might wish to acknowledge. What is cancer, after all? It\u0027s one of our own, gone wild. It has the same DNA as any other cell in our body, but it refuses to play by the rules.Science and Religion Correspondent for the Humanist MagazineFor a politician or a journalist, there was a time when citing the classics -- as long as it wasn\u0027t done in a pedantic or pompous manner -- was a mark of wisdom and experience. If a candidate or reporter does it today, there\u0027s a good chance they\u0027ll be trolled and ridiculed for high-handed pretension. Cue Donald Trump shouting, \"Loser!\"Senior writer, BillMoyers.com. Former senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.American voters would do well to heed the lessons of failure and anarchy in Iraq and Libya. They would do well to think hard before signing onto an encore presentation of U.S.-sponsored violence in the name of freedom in the Middle East.Teaches international relations at Northwestern UniversityTrump\u0027s performance last night reminded me of Richard Nixon\u0027s infamous answer to David Frost about Watergate: \"When the president does it, that means it\u0027s not illegal.\"Writer, Professor, Retired Lt. Colonel, Air ForceThe Democratic Party has not been taking seriously many of the reasons for Trump\u0027s support and the range of that support. And the media has not been discussing many of the reasons for Trump\u0027s support. That needs to change.Author of Don\u0027t Think of an Elephant! | UC Berkeley Professor of Linguistics | Founder of Reframe AmericaThe hard-bitten, corporatist Democrats are moving Hillary Clinton through the presidential primaries. They are using \"Republican-speak\" to beat down Sanders as favoring more taxes, and they may unwittingly be setting the stage for a serious split in the Democratic Party.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorHillary Clinton\u0027s camp (and the camp followers at the Washington Post and Fortune magazine) has made a remarkable discovery: National health insurance (aka Medicare-for-All) hurts poor people. How is that possible? It\u0027s not.Professor in the CUNY School of Public Health at Hunter College; Lecturer in Medicine, Harvard Medical School; Co-founder, Physicians for a National Health ProgramProfessor of Public Health at CUNY and Lecturer in Medicine at Harvard Medical School; Co-founder, Physicians for a National Health ProgramThere were more male body parts discussed in the most recent #GOPDebate in Detroit, Michigan than one might have expected in a presidential debate forum. From the perspective of feminist body theology, this was enormously revealing of actual issues at stake in this presidential election.Professor of Theology, Chicago Theological SeminaryNot a day goes by, it seems, without the mainstream media bashing Bernie Sanders\u0027s economic plan -- quoting certain economists as saying his numbers don\u0027t add up.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027On Christmas Eve in 2011, Hillary Clinton and her closest aides celebrated a $29.4 billion sale of over 80 F-15 fighter jets, manufactured by U.S.-based Boeing Corporation, to Saudi Arabia. In a chain of enthusiastic emails, an aide exclaimed that it was \"not a bad Christmas present.\"Co-founder, CODEPINK: Women for PeaceI am a busy parish priest half-way through Lent -- so I quite frankly did not have time this week to write about what it means to be prayerfully pro-choice... again. But the orchestrated efforts to turn back the clock on women\u0027s reproductive freedom left me no other principled choice.Episcopal priest and activist from Pasadena, Calif.With Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley\u0027s approval ratings faltering in a new poll on his role in obstructing the Supreme Court nomination process, Democratic challengers like state Sen. Rob Hogg are inspiring a groundswell of new support for a suddenly competitive election battle.Author of \"Damnatio Memoriae: A Play, Una Commedia,\" www.jeffbiggers.comThese survey results confirm what we have sensed in so many different ways over the last few years: namely, that more and more Americans want the National Football League to start respecting people of color and stop marketing a dictionary-defined racial slur.Oneida Indian Nation Representative; CEO, Oneida Nation EnterprisesAuthor and photojournalistInvesting in women-led startups is a long overdue phenomenon in this country. Only 7 percent of all investor money goes to startups led by women.Founder, craigslist and craigconnects.orgI don\u0027t mean \"acquaintances\" or Facebook friends, but my actual -- call you up on a bad day/let\u0027s have brunch on Saturday/help me, I\u0027m nervous about this date -- friends. Perhaps this wouldn\u0027t sound so weird except that I\u0027m a minister who works for a church.Kevin Wright currently serves as the Minister of Education at The Riverside Church in the City of New York.Beneath the white sheets of racism, you often find an integrationist, more scared of losing an election than following a conscience.Political science professor, LaGrange College in GeorgiaIn this era of exponentially advancing technologies, the only protections that really matter are speed to market and technological obsolescence. The underlying technologies are changing so fast, that by a time a patent is filed, it loses its innovation value.Academic, Researcher, Writer, EntrepreneurIt wasn\u0027t their condolences that bothered me; it was the look of surprise or the follow-up questions asking why I wanted a traditional wedding if my parents were dead. I know I could have taken an easier route. I know I could have gone to the courthouse or planned something informal and small, but that wasn\u0027t what I wanted.Certified Life Coach and Grief Recovery SpecialistBeing in a committed relationship takes an avalanche of effort and dedication from two people.Passionate ponderings from a curious mind...Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
