{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityLet\u0027s not make a mistake about the terrorism that has just been perpetrated against Americans. An alleged North Korean terrorist blackmail, escalating from a hack of Sony Pictures has for the first time in memory censored a major film release by an American studio. While we\u0027ve seen aspects of this before, make no mistake that this incident is terrorism, and a game changer. This about your right as an American to produce and consume political, artistic and social expression without governmental terrorism and censorship, in this case North Korea\u0027s. This includes your right to choose to see potentially dumb and distasteful films, as well your right not to see it. The choice for now is no longer yours, its theirs, and the terrorists dictated that you can\u0027t.We have all lost in this fight. There are no winners, and with the announcement, pained feelings we have carried for five decades come to the surface.Senior Editor, HuffPost VocesWhen there is conflict in unstable nations, the tide comes in with the strength of a tsunami to drown out the precious advances that women have made in those countries.Writer of English fiction and a journalistAnyone who runs a business -- whether it\u0027s a mom-and-pop shop or a multinational behemoth like Sony -- needs to pay close attention to what happened here, and begin to take data security seriously.Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911Reports that the Obama Administration is now actively working to normalize relations with Cuba should be welcome news to Americans across the political spectrum. The current state of affairs is an artifact of the Cold War that should have been changed decades ago and serves no national security or economic interest of the nation at all.School of International \u0026 Public Affairs, Columbia UniversityThe current Ebola outbreak underscores that pathogens remain clear and present dangers to humanity, economic development, and national security in an interconnected 21st century world, and we must remain vigilant against them.Public Health Editor, The Huffington Post; Former U.S. Assistant Surgeon GeneralToday, as The Colbert Report airs its final episode, I\u0027m looking back with gratitude on nine years of great television. I loved being on the show several times, discussing everything from my Greek accent to self-sabotage to the obnoxious roommate living in my head. Here are some of my favorite moments on The Colbert Report over the years.We rise to show we are determined to create a new kind of consciousness -- one where violence will be resisted until it is unthinkable.Building to One Billion Rising REVOLUTIONFor those who are serious about wanting to reduce the number of abortions in the United States, easy access to affordable and effective contraception, and ready advice about the proper use of contraception, is critical.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoJust because I\u0027m sober doesn\u0027t mean I don\u0027t want to come to your party. Maybe I do and maybe I don\u0027t, but if we\u0027re friends, I\u0027d at least like the invite so I can decide for myself.Blogger, www.itsalushlife.comIslam, my Islam, the Islam of 1.6 billion followers condemns the killing of children. It is a religion of peace, tolerance and mercy. So when extremists kill in the name of Islam, they distort our sacred religion and they hijack the identity of the moderate majority. Islam did not kill children yesterday. Evil, depraved monsters of men did.Queen of the Hashemite Kingdom of JordanThe faster financial markets adjust to all available information, confidential or not, the more efficient they become. But profiting off inside information that\u0027s not available to average investors strikes many as unfair. The \"coin of the realm\" on Wall Street and in corporate boardrooms is contributing to the savage inequalities of American life.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027It wasn\u0027t that the US has lacked opportunities to resume diplomatic relations with Cuba. We could have at least begun the process thirty-five years ago. I was there, and this is the story you will not read in any diplomatic archive. The story begins in Iran...Director, Giraffe Heroes InternationalElvish is only one of the many magical languages developed by J.R.R. Tolkien. The feat of creating language for fantasy has proven to add to viewers and readers experiences. By transplanting their imagination to a new world, fans are able to learn the new language and engage with each other.Professor of linguistics, Western civilization and American studies, Columbia UniversityI don\u0027t normally concern myself with where the party holds its nominating convention. Normally it doesn\u0027t matter much at all. I think this year might be a little different. I think it actually does matter for 2016.Co-Founder, Democracy PartnersThe school attack is a moment of reckoning for the Pakistani government, and more so for the Pakistani army, which is a major player in Pakistani politics.Former ambassador for Pakistan to Syria, Morocco, Malaysia and currently Adjunct Professor at Seton Hall UniversityIn 1980, it cost just under $600 to take a round-trip flight within the United States. Just 30 years later, that fare has been slashed nearly in half.Chairman/CEO, XPRIZEToday, President Barack Obama took bold action to put an end to this farce. Over half a century of a counterproductive sanctions and isolation policy is coming to an end. But Cuba is only one of many examples of domestic politics rendering American foreign policy dysfunctional.President, National Iranian American CouncilPolicy Fellow, National Iranian American Council\"I can\u0027t breathe\" speaks from the grave and describes the circumstances faced by many who are being choked by a system that treats different races and classes of people unequally.Visiting Researcher at Georgetown UniversityVisiting Researcher at Georgetown UniversityObama has taken a courageous step in shifting US policy toward Cuba. In their simultaneous speeches today, both Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro thanked Pope Francis for his efforts in helping to engineer the historic deal. CNN reported that bells were ringing in churches all over Havana. This is a wonderful day indeed.Professor, Thomas Jefferson School of LawThe bottom line is that this has become a fiscal and free speech fiasco for Sony. It sends a terrible message to this country\u0027s enemies and it sends us down a slippery slope of self-censorship and silence. When Hollywood is asked to put up or shut up, it will shut up.Professor and Brechner Eminent Scholar in Mass Communication, University of Florida in GainesvilleMy grandfather has accomplished enough in his 86 years for 86 more lifetimes, and he\u0027s done it all with a relentless sense of humor and a fierce loyalty to our family.

Back then, three things struck me about him: first, his extraordinary talent, his drive coupled with an incredible passion for football, and finally his personality. It was these three factors and all the hard work he put in that led him to the career we know.Football manager, former French national team managerCentral and South American countries stand at a key crossroads; as environmentally and economically vulnerable countries, they have much to lose in the face of devastating climate change.Senior Attorney, NRDCAbbas should not be expected to magically relieve the suffering of the Palestinian, but to preserve his credibility and his standing among the Palestinian people he needs to take action, not just make statements.Foreign Policy Fellow at the Brookings Institution\u0027s Doha Center and Adjunct Professor at Georgetown University in QatarAssociate Professor of International Studies at Marymount Manhattan College NYC, NYWelcome to the latest generation of computer games.
