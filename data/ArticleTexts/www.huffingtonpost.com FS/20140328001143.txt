{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"David BromwichProfessor of Literature, Yale UniversityObama\u0027s Brussels oration bore a striking resemblance to his Nobel Prize speech in 2009. Yesterday\u0027s effort was shorter and less pompous, but, in Brussels as in Oslo, Obama\u0027s words again carried the patina of American superiority. The attitude emerged most starkly where he went furthest to disown it: \"We Americans remember well the unimaginable sacrifices made by the Russian people in World War II, and we have honored those sacrifices.\" Do we remember those sacrifices? How exactly have we shown that we honor them -- in which administration and by what series of actions? If President Obama wanted to help us remember, he could have cited some numbers. Three hundred thousand Americans died in the Second World War: a terrible and frightening number. Twenty million Russians died -- one Russian out of eight. Educated Europeans know this. Few Americans of any generation know it.Comments (20)Jill DoughertyShorenstein Center fellowOnly national unity, in which the individual sets aside his own welfare for the good of the country, Putin believes, can ensure the nation will survive. Russia is a unique civilization, fully entitled to reject the values forced down its throat by the West.CommentsDarren AronofskyFilmmakerThis is our garden. We have dominion over it. Are we tending it? Are we keeping it? Will we stand before it with Awe and Reverence, or will we corrupt our way upon it?Comments (40)Susan CainAuthor, New York Times Bestseller \u0027QUIET: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can\u0027t Stop Talking\u0027In honor of Arianna Huffington\u0027s marvelous book THRIVE, I want to write about a very specific aspect of well-being: freedom from fear of sharing one\u0027s ideas.CommentsKelli CatanaBlogger, www.kellidaisy.comI am a bad parent. And I am a good parent. I am your typical, average parent. I had four kids in five years and I\u0027m pretty sure that I was a bit insane for about three and a half of them. I am guilty of being bossy and I am guilty of shoving electronics into my children\u0027s hands if it buys me peace.Comments (42)Seamus McKiernanSenior Blog Editor, Special Projects, Huffington PostMaybe it makes sense for Burger King and the NCAA to partner on TV commercials this March Madness. But it\u0027s wrong that college athletes and fast food workers are forced to play the serfs in a feudal system that only rewards the overlords.CommentsDr. Tim MainardiPhysician, researcher and educatorSpring is finally rolling around the corner, and for most of us, that\u0027s a big relief. For many others, however, this revival of life also means the return of sneezing, coughing, wheezing, itching and other vexing symptoms of spring allergies, commonly known as hay fever.CommentsJacqueline NovogratzFounder and CEO of AcumenArianna Huffington has nailed it. We Thrive when we move from a place of wonder and generosity. We Thrive when we are used for good. It is not always easy, and rarely connected to a more facile quest for \"happiness.\" To Thrive, really, is to be grounded in a state of grace.CommentsDavid Katz, M.D.Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterMr. Bittman is absolutely not qualified to assert the health effects of butter based on a recent meta-analysis I rather doubt he read in its somewhat excruciating detail.CommentsRep. Alan GraysonU.S. Congressman for Florida\u0027s 9th DistrictIt\u0027s time for our government to shed some light on its drone practices. Transparency, as uncomfortable as it may sometimes be, is an essential part of our democracy. Americans need the facts -- the who, what, when, where, and (most importantly) why -- in order to decide if the benefits of these strikes outweigh the negatives.CommentsEric BoehlertSenior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaThe pressing, constitutional question wasn\u0027t whether Nixon himself had drawn up the harebrained scheme to break into Democratic Party offices inside the Watergate apartment complex in 1972. It was whether Nixon knew his underlings were running a criminal enterprise from inside the executive offices. The same holds true for Christie today.CommentsMark GongloffChief financial writer, The Huffington PostMonopoly\u0027s new \"house rules\" will probably not be popular in the houses of Ron Paul or Rick Perry. Many of those rules are straight out of their Fed-hating nightmares.Comments (214)Dan LyonsMarketing fellow at HubSpot and creator of \u0027The Secret Diary of Steve Jobs\u0027That phrase -- \"traffic whore\" -- tells you everything you need to know about why some journalists have an aversion to chasing traffic. They fear it creates an incentive to do the wrong things.CommentsPaul Brandeis RaushenbushExecutive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostWorld Vision just announced that they have reversed their policy, announced only two days ago, to accept gay Christians as employees. This is so sad, and so bad for everyone.Comments (90)Gabrielle Giffords and Mark KellyToday, you are more important than we are. It\u0027s up to you to lead. Make the choice to serve. Endeavor to do something extraordinary. And when life throws setback and challenges your way, grit your teeth and keep on going.CommentsSharda SekaranManaging Director of Communications, Drug Policy AllianceIt would seem that marijuana has finally entered the mainstream of U.S. and international politics. However, someone has neglected to tell the many news outlets that continue to recycle the same old \"Cheech \u0026 Chong\" images that should have been retired decades ago.Comments (149)Adam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911When it comes to debt, there really are no free lunches. Indeed, it is always harder to get out of than it is to get into. The best thing you can do is to change your own thinking when it comes to money. When you are in debt, even the price tag has a price tag.CommentsGavin Newsom and Zachary BookmanCities and states are now the driving force in a national movement to harness technology to share a wealth of government information and data. Many forward thinking local governments now provide effective tools to the public to make sense of all this data.CommentsRobert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Charles and David Koch should not be blamed for having more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of Americans put together. But in using their vast wealth to change those rules and laws in order to fit their political views, the Koch brothers are undermining our democracy.Comments (505)The Unappreciated PastorPastor of a small church in the Bible BeltI was 25 when I became a senior pastor. That was 15 years ago. Time has gone by so quickly. I have been reminiscing about life in the ministry. In looking back I have come to the conclusion that it would have been great if there were a mentor in my life to prepare me for ministry.CommentsPablo OrtelladoActivist and professorBrazil will only provide asylum to Snowden if the citizenry of Brazil pressures the government to do so. Accomplishing this is our responsibility.Comments (15)Alon Ben-MeirSenior Fellow, NYU\u0027s Center for Global AffairsObama has not acted decisively with Western allies in an effort to end the horrific civil war in Syria. The tragic loss of nearly 150,000 Syrians, 9 million internally displaced persons and refugees, and the massive destruction would still pale in comparison to the near-complete devastation of the nation if nothing is done soon.CommentsThe Motley FoolTo Educate, Amuse \u0026 EnrichNinety-nine percent of personal finance can be summarized in nine words: Work a lot, spend a little, invest the difference. Master that, and the other 2.999 billion words are filler.CommentsNaomi CampbellModel, Actor, Activist, Mentor and Executive Producer of The FaceBeing aware of your energy levels makes a big difference, because when you\u0027re working long hours, it is vital to keep your energy up in order to deliver the best performance.CommentsSusan P. JoyceEditor and chief technology writer, Job - Hunt.orgIn the last few years, the widespread use of search engines and the growth of social media have changed recruiting in ways that are transparent to most job seekers. Not understanding those technological changes makes job hunting more challenging (and discouraging).Comments (12)Bob CescaManaging Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowIn order to build the National Park Service for posterity, we all have to make at least a small effort to block attempts to destroy it. Clearly, the GOP is only concerned with scoring points with fringe wackadoodles who can\u0027t seem to remember anything that happened prior to January 20, 2009.Comments (143)Richard (RJ) EskowSenior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourIf progressive and populist ideas resonate with most voters, some people have asked, why isn\u0027t the Democratic Party doing better in the polls? Here\u0027s one reason: Some of the party\u0027s most prominent leaders are still pushing Wall Street\u0027s unpopular and discredited economic platform.Comments (28)Marwan BisharaAl Jazeera\u0027s senior political analyst and host of the Al Jazeera program \u0027Empire\u0027Nowadays, many of those who use the term \"Cold War,\" do so casually to warn against the dangers of a widening Moscow-Washington divide. That\u0027s commendable. But others use the term to advocate a renewed military build-up in Europe. That\u0027s both flawed and dangerous.CommentsJonathan HaidtHenry Kaufman Visiting Professor in the Business and Society Program Area, New York University Stern School of BusinessShould leaders who want to create high-performing companies try to foster feelings of wonder in their employees? The evidence suggests that the answer is yes.CommentsJohn FefferCo-director, Foreign Policy In FocusThe new spring season is just around the corner, and it looks as though the new \"in\" color is brown. That\u0027s brown as in \"brown shirts.\" Perhaps you thought that fascism went out of fashion in the 20th century. But there\u0027s nothing like a lingering economic crisis to bring out the vintage ideologies.CommentsChristian GabrielArtist, writer and musicianBeing poor anywhere sucks, but there\u0027s perhaps a particular kind of soul crushing that one experiences being poor in New York City. On average, after rent and bills, I probably had less than three hundred dollars per month to put toward food, other expenses and social activities.Comments (252)LearnVest, 2014.27.03Nathan Manske, 2014.27.03Dean Regas, 2014.27.03Evan DeFilippis, 2014.27.03Jed Kolko, 2014.27.03Food Fanatic, 2014.27.03Robert David Jaffee, 2014.27.03David Blumenthal, 2014.27.03Phillip M.
