Life needs its pauses, its chapter breaks, if the soul is to have space to breathe. Otherwise, we may not be in Egypt, but we can still be slaves.Read Post | CommentsClarence B. Jones, 04/12/12Scholar in Residence, Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute at Stanford UniversityHow many more Trayvon Martins have to occur to mobilize us to national action?
