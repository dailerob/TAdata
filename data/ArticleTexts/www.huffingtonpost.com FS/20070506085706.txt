{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AP/ReutersThese are tough times for Public Displays of Affection. First, Richard Gere\u0027s public smooch of Bollywood beauty Shilpa Shetty in New Delhi resulted in his being burned in effigy and charged with violating local obscenity laws (I can see burning him in effigy for Autumn in New York, but a kiss?). Then, this week, Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad came under fire for kissing the hand of his elderly former schoolteacher. Actually, the Tehran Gigolo kissed the thick gloves she was wearing, along with a headscarf and long black coat (the scalawag!). \"This type of indecency progressively has grave consequences,\" fumed one Iranian newspaper. Progressive indecency, indeed. Next thing you know he\u0027ll admit there was a Holocaust and concede that Israel has a right to exist.READ POST | comments05.01.2007 Nora EphronWhy, when Tenet read Woodward\u0027s book, didn\u0027t he say right then that that wasn\u0027t what he meant? Why didn\u0027t he go public and say that the administration had misused the available intelligence?READ POST | comments (171)04.30.2007 Walter IsaacsonVáclav Havel said that there were two types of people he had dealt with over the years: those with the soul of a collaborationist and those who were comfortable defying authority.READ POST | comments (89)05.02.2007 Sen. Russ FeingoldLetting the President have his way all over again is the kind of thinking that got us into this war in the first place, and it\u0027s not going to cut it anymore.READ POST | comments (431)05.04.2007 John RidleyAt the debate, among the candidates, the attendees, even among the press, I was it. I was the black guy. When you can count the people of color you see on four fingers, you can\u0027t help but really feel your blackness.READ POST | comments (69)05.04.2007 Gov. Bill RichardsonCongress has the ability to end this war under the War Powers Act -- let\u0027s not wait or waver while more people die. And de-authorizing the war should mean removing all our troops. Every last one.READ POST | comments (134)05.03.2007 Bill MaherIsn\u0027t one of the main selling points of the Democratic Party that it\u0027s relatively nut-free? I know we\u0027re all about big tents these days, but a tent that covers both this guy and Nancy Pelosi?READ POST | comments (255)05.01.2007 Jane SmileyHaving begun the Iraq civil war, the PNACkers have no interest in ending it (and don\u0027t know how, anyway). Why is that? It is because they don\u0027t know who the enemy is?READ POST | comments (135)04.29.2007 Caterina FakeBaby, according to my book, at seven months you\u0027re already 3 lbs. The other 25 lbs. I am assuming is stuff you need. You better come with a Bugaboo.READ POST | comments (19)05.04.2007 Sheryl CrowIt\u0027s been well over a week since our little run in with the adviser to our president. I am just now processing all that took place during the last few days of the tour and a few concerns still hang heavy on my mind and heart.READ POST | comments (124)05.04.2007 Chris KellyWarrants for lawyers. And lawyers\u0027 landladies. And the people their lawyers\u0027 landladies, uh, call on the phone. And people who buy plane tickets by phone when better fares are available on AA.com.
