In the midst of this burgeoning crisis, President Obama has been a voice of reality and reason, calling for an agreement that will restore economic growth in Greece and keep Greece in the European Union.

He did not want to look like a girl.MotherThe limits under Obama\u0027s proposed authorization are an important distinction, which we hope will carry on through future administrations.
