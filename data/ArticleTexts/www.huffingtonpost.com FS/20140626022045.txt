{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"All day today at my apartment, I\u0027ve been hosting a meeting of the B Team, which Richard Branson co-founded last year to change the values that drive businesses, to prioritize people and planet alongside profit, and to move beyond our obsession with quarterly earnings and short-term growth. And before we started the day, I interviewed Richard at AOL\u0027s Brand Camp leadership meeting, which reminded me of a conversation he and I had in 2009, on board Virgin America\u0027s inaugural flight from San Francisco to Orange County, covering everything from space travel and global warming to marijuana and the music business.The Supreme Court unanimously ruled today that police may not search information on an arrested suspect\u0027s cell phone without an additional search warrant.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityThis year really heralds the fourth evolution of the Internet: the Internet of Everything (IoE). The Internet first gave us basic connectivity and then a networked economy and immersive experiences, but today, IoE promises to be more disruptive, pervasive and vital to our lives than the Internet itself.Wim ElfrinkExecutive Vice President, Industry Solutions \u0026 Chief Globalization Officer, CiscoDangerous sectarian tensions, massive movements of refugees, daily atrocities and spreading instability make the civil war in Syria a global threat. All the values for which we stand, and all the reasons for which the United Nations exists, are at stake across the devastated landscape that is Syria today.Secretary-General, United NationsIn a major win for broadcasters, the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that Aereo, a streaming service that provides access to programs at about the same time as they are broadcast, violates the Copyright Act of 1976. The decision is a huge blow for Aereo, which may go out of business.Hofstra Journalism ProfessorYet impartial journalism is remarkably resilient, despite the mocking and stereotyping it has endured. There\u0027s plenty of room for other models, but it\u0027s worth recognizing the value impartiality delivers.Deputy managing editor and standards editor, Associated PressThe important thing is that a film doesn\u0027t obliterate a book. The movie is here now. But the book hasn\u0027t gone away. It has simply grown up, grown larger, and begun to glisten in a new way.Author, \u0027The Giver\u0027Accused of paying its workers too little, Walmart has responded in the most 2014 way possible: by being snarky on the Internet with a \"fact check.\" Unfortunately, it is longer on snark than on facts.Chief financial writer, The Huffington PostWith a record number of female candidates running and with women making up 53 percent of the vote, we were able to elect a record number of women to Congress. My hope is that we can do this once again in 2014. Because this isn\u0027t just about numbers -- it\u0027s also about policies.U.S. Senator from New YorkWhile there is no doubt that seeing children in such conditions is distressing, the public concern for the children\u0027s well-being is revealing itself to be deeply mixed with anxiety regarding the presence of Latino immigrants in the US.2014 Echoing Green Global Fellow and Executive Director of the Colibri Center for Human RightsStudent at the George Washington UniversityDo sleep on your left side. This is best for air-flow to the baby. Don\u0027t touch me. Can\u0027t you get into bed without touching me?Writer, ProducerPeople may assume that with a last name like \"Warrior,\" the baton of victory must have been handed to me. The truth is far from it.Chief Technology and Strategy Officer, CiscoDon\u0027t waste time being wistful for who you once were. Instead, stay grateful for who you are to each other today. Being grateful and present sheds the right light on everything and everyone.WriterRwanda\u0027s success, while remarkable, is not a mystery. Investments were based on the evidence, tackling the biggest threats to child survival by increasing effective interventions such as vaccinations and breastfeeding rates.Pediatrician, Minister of Health of RwandaSenior Vice President for Strategic Initiatives, Save the ChildrenI was a bigot. Hence, I can sympathize with all those who still are. I was terrified of pit bulls. I knew very little about them, but what I\u0027d heard in the media sure sounded terrifying. But it turns out it\u0027s utter garbage. All of it. Even the term \"pit bull\" is junk zoology.Novelist, AmnesiaWe know, and every study confirms, that strong reading skills are critical to a child\u0027s success in school. But kids won\u0027t simply take to reading just because they\u0027re told to. They need a way in.Director of Hispanic engagement for First BookThe tolerance of child abuse by federal authorities violates our laws and our values -- it is both inhumane and immoral. Now is the time to put an end to it.Staff Lawyer, ACLU Border Litigation ProjectThe setting, the characters, and the dialogue in this play, are fictional. Unfortunately the court case, Vergara v. California, and the judge\u0027s decision are all too real.Social studies educator, Hofstra UniversityPresident Obama recently likened denying climate change to believing the moon is made of cheese. As it turns out, ignoring this particular food\u0027s role in climate change is just as irresponsible.President, Physicians Committee for Responsible MedicineToday, the Iraq civil war is increasingly becoming a conflict between those who believe that there is --or must be -- a nation called Iraq, and those who view Iraq as a transient historical phenomenon with no inherent identity or purpose.President, Fiscal Strategies GroupReal GDP contracted at a 2.9 percent rate according to revised data released on Wednesday. That\u0027s contracted, as in went down. So, are we back in recession?Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorAs I began learning to feed myself safely, I also gained a skill set I did not even know existed. Cooking may be something I do for myself, but it\u0027s not really just a solo activity to feed nutrients to your body. It became empowering, therapeutic, social, romantic, and practical.Mental health counselor, writerThis is just so stunningly, awesomely dumb, it\u0027s hard to take in. Are they that enamored of the magical power of tests? Do they imagine that disabled students are just all faking, or that the specialists who diagnose these various problems are just making stuff up for giggles?Teacher, writer, blogger at curmudgucationEarlier this week, the Hockey Hall of Fame announced its induction class of 2014. All of these gentlemen had careers worthy of induction. However, that does not mean I am a fan of the Hockey Hall of Fame selection process.Retired NHL Player and NHL Referee, ECAC Director of Hockey Officiating, Chairman KHL Officiating Evaluation and Discipline CommitteesWhile this particular column of Will\u0027s was offensive and inaccurate, that doesn\u0027t mean the St. Louis Dispatch was right, or even wise, to discontinue running his column in general. Debate and discussion are what have helped bring much of the long and ongoing mistreatment of victims by school administrations to light.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarWhatever attributes Uganda\u0027s Foreign Minister Sam Kutesa may have, his election to the presidency of the 193-member UN General Assembly is overshadowed by his country\u0027s draconian legislation used to hunt down, isolate and jail homosexuals.Veteran journalist reporting from the United NationsThe world has many problems to solve. Yet Silicon Valley, which could be taking the lead in ridding humanity of its ills, is focused on scoring big hits by solving problems so small they can be said to be non-existent.Academic, Researcher, Writer, EntrepreneurAs we look at a world with urgent needs, many realize that there is an incredible opportunity to more effectively bring companies and entrepreneurs into the business of solving social problems by both tapping the entrepreneurial spirit, and by leveraging the power of the private sector.CEO, Case FoundationIn 2005, while Dick Cheney, Paul Wolfowitz and Bill Kristol were sitting at desks in Washington, my unit was fighting their war in Iraq. They were playing armchair general. We were kicking in doors, getting shot at and driving on IED-planted roads in unarmored vehicles designed for amphibious assaults.Iraq War veteran; former Arizona state representative; candidate for the U.S. Congress representing Arizona\u0027s seventh congressional districtI have decided to think back to my world view when I was my raw 25 year-old self. What would I have thought about my present life and what life advice would I have given \"back to the future\" to my 50 year-old self?Executive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostHillary Clinton is neither a liberal nor a true conservative. Rather, she\u0027s an electable Democratic candidate who leans to the right. She\u0027s the Democratic version of Mitt Romney. President Hillary Clinton will be a conservative Barack Obama and a somewhat liberal George Bush.Author and Journalist published in Salon.com, the Jerusalem Post, Chicago Tribune, The Hill\u0027s Congress Blog, and other publications.Judge Jeanine Pirro has set a new bar for fire-eating, not to mention the most easily-debunkable nonsense per sentence of any Fox News host, past or present.Managing Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"GAY MARRIAGE APPROACHES SCOTUS STEPS",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
