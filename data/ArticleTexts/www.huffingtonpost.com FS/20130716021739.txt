{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonToday, Points of Light, an organization that encourages Americans to volunteer, announced the 5,000th Daily Point of Light Award. While serving on the board of Points of Light back in the \u002790s, I began working with an offshoot called Family Matters, a program that encouraged families to discover the benefits of volunteering together. I had seen those benefits in a very real way in my own family. There are so many forces that divide us from one another. And with the increasing presence of technology, families can easily drift apart, even while in the same room. Volunteering is a force that can bridge those divides and strengthen families at the same time. The idea is to make volunteering a first-level option for families when they\u0027re deciding what to do -- right in the mix with movies, going out to eat, playdates, soccer, and Little League. In other words, a normal part of American family life.Comments (34)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027Death is horrible enough. But systematic injustice -- one that allows white boys to assume success, yet leads black boys to cower from the very institutions created to protect our own wellbeing -- is a travesty.Comments (331)Kirk DouglasActorSex may fade, but love... love lasts. They don\u0027t realize that the most important element of love will be waiting for them. Romance. Beautiful romance.CommentsMarian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe outrage over the killing of an unarmed Black teenager who was doing nothing wrong must continue until some semblance of justice is achieved. Let us refuse to be silent until the killing of Black mothers\u0027 sons is as important as the killing of White mothers\u0027 sons.Comments (1,218)QuestloveDrummer, The RootsI do have desires to go to certain places and do certain things and enjoy the perks and benefits of a person who works his arse off as much as I do. So I got over my hangups of not wanting to be the odd guy in the room some time around 2007. Mixed results at best.Comments (33)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkIf we allow the killing of an unarmed Black teenager to be turned into some sort of circus where the responsible party blames the victim, then we have reached the height of absurdity. But in this moment of frustration, we cannot become so disillusioned that we lose focusComments (101)Evan HandlerActor, author, screenwriter, and journalistWhat do I think about Trayvon Martin\u0027s death? I think the people who passed the laws, as they stand in Florida, made his death inevitable. If not his, certainly someone else\u0027s.Comments (184)Russell SimmonsFounder, GlobalGrind.comWhen our laws ill-affect one community much more then another they must be challenged. I join the Trayvon Martin Foundation in their fight to end every law in America that creates the environment for a tragedy like to this to ever happen again.Comments (143)Brian Levin, J.D.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityThere are various criminal federal civil rights and hate crime laws available to prosecutors dating back to the post Civil War period, but all have material limitations that substantially impact its application toward George Zimmerman.Comments (134)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarThe past few years especially have seen a tremendous uprising of parenting experts, including baby nurses, parenting coaches, and, of course, mommy bloggers. Everyone has a different opinion, and there are endless outlets through which to voice that opinion.Comments (81)Richard BransonFounder, Virgin GroupCory Monteith was a beautiful soul. His awareness of his own struggles led him to reach out to young people all over the world with deep compassion and empathy to help them through their struggles.CommentsMark GongloffChief financial writer, The Huffington PostThe trial this week of Fabrice \"Fabulous Fab\" Tourre is almost guaranteed to accomplish nothing but highlighting the weakness of the U.S. government\u0027s response to the financial crisis.Comments (18)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027It is bizarre that Summers would be seriously considered as the next Fed chair. Memories tend to be short in Washington, but those of us removed from elite circles know that Summers\u0027 policies played a central role in setting up the economy for the crash.Comments (17)Robert CreamerPolitical Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersBy standing up to Republican abuse of rules in the Senate, Democrats will be standing up to the economic abuse inflicted on most Americans by a tiny minority of unelected, wealthy speculators and CEOs who think they are entitled to be \"masters of the universe.\"Comments (275)Michael SmerconishSiriusXM Radio HostThere might be more at stake in the race for comptroller of New York City than the future of former Gov. Eliot Spitzer. This could be a final referendum on the sex scandal as we know it, and a reboot on the level of intrusion into the private lives of public servants.Comments (61)Alafair BurkeNovelist, Criminal Law ProfessorThat may have been the moment when Zimmerman got acquitted. The end result was that jurors were told only about the parts of Florida self-defense law that benefited the defendant, without knowing anything about the most relevant potential limitation.Comments (323)Simon JohnsonAuthor, \u0027White House Burning: The Founding Fathers, Our National Debt, and Why It Matters To You\u0027Even Sandy Weil, former CEO of Citigroup who led the charge against the remnants of Glass-Steagall in the 1990s, concedes that this was a regrettable mistake -- and argues for all of the biggest banks to be broken up.Comments (46)Jack MirkinsonMedia Editor, The Huffington PostMost of \"The Newsroom\u0027s\" biggest problems are still big problems, but remains a show with an incredible cast, a creator who is capable of great things, and a premise that could still work. Let\u0027s keep our fingers crossed, shall we?Comments (109)Michael ShawPublisher of BagNewsNotes, topping LIFE.com\u0027s 2011 Best Photo BlogsOne thing that struck me immediately about the photo coverage of the response to the Zimmerman verdict is the number of widely-published newswire images highlighting a multi-racial response.CommentsSec. Kathleen Sebelius and Valerie JarrettWe now understand that to prevent long-term complications of HIV, treatment is recommended for all adults and adolescents living with HIV. This has powerful implications for how we focus our efforts.CommentsJudith Browne DianisCo-Director, Advancement ProjectThe movement must not stop with this verdict but continue on until each and every young man of color in America can walk the streets in any of our nation\u0027s neighborhoods unafraid, knowing not only that he is safe, but that his country walks beside him.Comments (1,114)Charles ClymerBlogger, student and Army veteranIf a stranger approached you with a gun, late at night, how would you react? As a white person, I am permitted to attack and defend myself. People of color, within seconds, must consider how this will look to a jury. Think that\u0027s off-base?Comments (1,139)Leo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersThe GOP retains a 1950s I Love Lucy caricature of women because the party doesn\u0027t listen to women. The party doesn\u0027t hear women\u0027s voices. Literally.Comments (146)Omnia SaedHigh school student in VirginiaIt could\u0027ve been me, couldn\u0027t it? I mean, Skittles after all are one of my favorite candies, and I have a sweet tooth for Arizona Iced Tea. And I\u0027m a teenager. And I\u0027m black. And I wear hoodies.Comments (71)Sandip RoyCulture editor, Firstpost.com; editor, New America MediaThey were all trying to get home -- Oscar Grant in Oakland, Trayvon Martin in Florida, or the woman who was raped in a bus in New Delhi. They didn\u0027t want to spark off great protests. They didn\u0027t want to become symbols, placards or posters.CommentsRobert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Today, the social class of one\u0027s parents determines educational and financial success more than at any time since World War II. But the children of the non-rich, who far outnumber the children of the rich, need higher education once again to be the great meritocracy.Comments (465)Alfred W. McCoyProfessor of History at the University of Wisconsin-MadisonThe technology used is state of the art; the impulse, it turns out, is nothing new. For well over a century, what might be called \"surveillance blowback\" from America\u0027s wars has ensured the creation of an ever more massive and omnipresent internal security and surveillance apparatus.Comments (55)Michael W. WatersFounding Pastor, Joy Tabernacle A.M.E. Church, Dallas, TexasDisturbingly, in our nation, being a black boy and walking in a gated community is a capital offence. For these young black boys, and countless others, were tried, convicted, and put to death by a system that says the lives of young black boys do not matter.Comments (62)Pat GallagherFreelance WriterI think he wanted to say something to me then, [but] we didn\u0027t have time to say. The girls went off with him, and when they got out of the car, he said, \"Bye, I love you.\" They said, \"Bye, dad,\" and that was it. We never saw him again.Comments (19)Adrian KulpBlogger \u0026 Author, \"Dad Or Alive\"I sometimes forget that this innocent little girl who tries my patience (often, but certainly not always) is going to eventually grow into a woman. I forget how important it is for her to love her dad.CommentsEd MierzwinskiConsumer Advocate, US PIRGIt\u0027s time to stop making stuff up about the CFPB. It\u0027s not spying on Americans. It\u0027s out there protecting American consumers -- from families to seniors, from students to veterans -- from unfair financial practices.CommentsJackie K.
