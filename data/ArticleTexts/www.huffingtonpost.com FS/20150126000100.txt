Proposals included higher minimum wage, child tax credits, and free community college. Unanswered was why he didn\u0027t do this back in the days of bipartisan belt-tightening, which extended the decline of the middle class. Meanwhile, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, mindfulness was on many minds -- sessions on the practice, which attendees once rolled their eyes at, were standing room only this year.

Yet the reality for nearly 750 million people is vastly different.ActorMy decision about whether to engage from the outside or seek elected office came down to a single question: how best can I fight for a level playing field at this point?California Philanthropist \u0026 Climate ChampionThe courageous women and men who are speaking out about their assaults should not have to share the most horrific experiences of their lives publicly in order to get the attention of their schools and their government. That shouldn\u0027t be on them.U.S. Senator from New YorkWith strong leaders from both the public and private sector, we can slow climate change now by putting a price on carbon, eliminating fuel subsidies, and bring together bold, innovative country plans.President, World Bank GroupKing Abdullah\u0027s writ lasted all of 12 hours. Within that period the Sudairis, a rich and politically powerful clan within the House of Saud, which had been weakened by the late king, burst back into prominence. They produced a palace coup in all but name.Editor, Middle East EyeI told myself that I would commit to just 15 minutes a day, nothing crazy.

A world in which the Jews once again became the scapegoats for all people\u0027s fears and frustrations would be a world in which free people could not breathe easy and the enslaved would be even more enslaved.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.On January 28, it will be 90 days since diabetes Type 1 became a part of my 8-year-old daughter\u0027s life.Senior Editor, HuffPost VocesMost human rights advocates would agree that jailing people indefinitely without trial, at times in solitary confinement or other harsh conditions, is hard to justify. The biggest problem with Obama\u0027s call to close the military prison at Gitmo is that it doesn\u0027t go far enough.Editor, Latino VoicesOn yet another anniversary of Roe, women\u0027s health opponents in Congress will mark the occasion by voting for a national ban on abortion at 20 weeks. Even if the ban fails, the right under Roe will still not be realized for millions of women.Executive Director of the National Health Law ProgramThe billionaire class has views that are profoundly out of step with everyday Americans. And that goes a long way to explain the agenda of the new Congress.Independent U.S. Senator from VermontPresident, Public CitizenRecently the New York Times published the latest in its series of sub-par articles on the current racial justice movement. Like its predecessors, this installment dutifully reinforces conventional wisdom that does not stand up to challenge.Scholar, Organizer, InstigatorThe old saying, \"Success is getting what you want and happiness is wanting what you get\" might well sum up the dilemma of many professional women.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarArticles about the war in Ukraine invariably cite the over 4,800 casualties and one million displaced persons reported by the UN. That number, as horrible as it is, is just a small percentage of the humanitarian suffering that continues to unfold on the ground.Author of A Backpack, a Bear, and Eight Crates of VodkaIf you choose to avoid standard, recommended vaccines such as measles, you are not merely putting your own health at risk -- you are choosing to do the same for all the rest of us. Sorry, folks, but that\u0027s the harsh reality.Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterAs we reflect on the 42nd anniversary of Roe v. Wade and House Majority leadership\u0027s abortion fiasco, let\u0027s make sure the lesson we learn is the right one: The majority of Americans want their lawmakers to focus on policies that keep women -- and this country -- moving forward, not on turning back the clock.President of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Planned Parenthood Action Fund and Planned Parenthood VotesAre National Football League referees, in addition to their duties policing a chaotic game of borderline violence, also supposed to serve as grade school hall monitors?BOB KATZ\u0027 most recent book, The Whistleblower: Rooting for the Ref in the High-Stakes World of College Basketball, will be published Feb. 3.Given that there is unquestionably far to go when it comes to fair housing opportunities and conditions, the Supreme Court shouldn\u0027t dishonor Dr. King\u0027s memory by removing one of the tools we have used to build bridges from the \"islands of despair\" of racialized poverty and segregation that Dr. King so powerfully decried.Chief Counsel, Constitutional Accountability CenterYou learn that in order to succeed, you have to assimilate to a culture that is not your own and does not welcome you, no matter what you do.Writer, educator, dreamer, bad-assI offer a potential outcome on marriage equality when the Supreme Court takes it up this spring that New York Law School professor Art Leonard suggested as a possibility come June: Chief Justice John Roberts joins the majority and writes the decision himself, making it the narrowest possible ruling with regard to the ramifications for LGBT equality beyond marriage.Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesNew evidence about addiction isn\u0027t just a challenge to us politically.

With fewer resources available for more programs, government must be smarter about how it functions.Chief of Staff, City of BostonSince December, Congress has twice passed measures to weaken regulations in the Dodd-Frank financial law that are intended to reduce the risk of another financial meltdown. In the last election cycle, Wall Street banks and financial interests spent over $1.2 billion on lobbying and campaign contributions, according to Americans for Financial Reform. Their spending strategy appears to be working. Just this week, the House passed further legislation that would delay by two years some key provisions of Dodd-Frank. \"[Banks] want to be able to do things their way, and that\u0027s very dangerous,\" MIT economist Simon Johnson tells me. \"\u0027Here we go again\u0027 -- I think that\u0027s exactly the motto, or the bumper sticker, for this Congress.
