{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Chief financial writer, The Huffington PostThe latest jobs numbers could have been much worse -- but they also could have been a lot better. Try 6.8 percent unemployment instead of 7.8 percent. The risk of a only half-decent jobs report like September\u0027s is that it might cause policymakers to lose sight of how far the job market still has to go. The bulk of the jobs picked up in the September report were part-time jobs. Many of the jobs created in the recovery have been lower-wage jobs. The unemployment rate among those ages 18 to 29 is 11.8 percent. African-Americans are suffering a 13.4 percent unemployment rate. More than 1.7 million Americans have been unemployed for 99 weeks or more. Meanwhile, the fiscal cliff of tax increases and spending cuts is looming at the end of the year, and Europe could blow up at any moment. It\u0027s not time to celebrate.Read Post | Comments (2,213)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 10/05/12Author, research psychologist, and gender scholarWe\u0027re always hearing about children and teenagers who share too much: with their friends; with their parents; online, with the world. But what happens when it\u0027s Mom and Dad dabbling in TMI? How do we know how much--and what sort of--information our kids can handle?Read Post | Comments (108)Robert Reich, 10/05/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027In political terms, headlines are everything -- and most major media are leading with the drop in the unemployment rate. Look more closely, though, and the picture is murkier.Read Post | Comments (469)James Zogby, 10/06/12President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Long before this week\u0027s presidential debate, the contours of this election had already been set. Despite the near hysterical and, at times, irritatingly silly reactions from pundits, right and left, the debate itself added very little that will impact the ultimate outcome of the contest.Read Post | Comments (307)Richard (RJ) Eskow, 10/06/12Writer; host, \u0027The Breakdown\u0027; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureIt\u0027s more than a little ironic that Jack Welch, who agrees with Mitt Romney that \"corporations are people,\" is pontificating about electoral matters. With its record of felony convictions, Welch\u0027s GE wouldn\u0027t even be allowed to vote.Read Post | Comments (180)Arianna Huffington, 10/05/12In this week\u0027s issue of Huffington, David Wood continues to put the spotlight on the sacrifices and struggles of America\u0027s veterans; Arthur Delaney looks at a NC congressman\u0027s very public battle with an unemployed constituent; and Catherine Pearson reports on new evidence expanding our understanding of in vitro fertilization.Read Post | Comments (49)Willow Bay, 10/05/12Senior Editor of The Huffington PostJessica Herrin, founder of Stella \u0026 Dot, sells jewelry. In fact, she sells lots of it -- $100 million worth last year alone -- by combining personal service with an e-commerce platform and social media. Herrin calls it \"social selling.\"Read Post | CommentsRobert S. McElvaine, 10/06/12HistorianRomney understands that he can\u0027t win if he runs as a regressive Republican. He realizes that the policies and values of the President and Democrats are far more popular than the Paul Ryan/Tea Party line he had been preaching. So the infinitely adaptable Mitt Romney has decided to run as Barack Obama.Read Post | Comments (188)Adam Levin, 10/05/12Founder, Credit.com and former director NJ Division of Consumer AffairsAs I watched Governor Romney in the presidential debate Wednesday night I was reminded of a financial tactic the candidate\u0027s political supporters and financial backers on Wall Street used during the mortgage boom -- the one that netted them billions of dollars while simultaneously pushing the American economy off a cliff.Read Post | Comments (315)Karen Dukess, 10/06/12Writer, Blogger, theblunderyears.comWe stayed in Moscow for six years, years that we wouldn\u0027t have had if we each hadn\u0027t been bold enough to give up something good for the promise of something we thought would be better.Read Post | CommentsSimon Watt, 10/05/12Evolutionary biologist, writer, science communicator and TV presenterGiant pandas are charismatic, fascinating creatures. From a biological perspective, I find them so very interesting. I really like them. And yet, I think it may be the time to let them drift off into extinction or, at the very least, reconsider our approach to their conservation. I do not say this lightly.Read Post | Comments (121)Marian Wright Edelman, 10/05/12President, Children\u0027s Defense FundDolores Huerta\u0027s many successes over the years have proven her right about the power every person can have once they are ready to claim it and work together with others for change.Read Post | CommentsBonnie Kavoussi, 10/05/12Economics Reporter, The Huffington PostIf you think the numbers in the September jobs report were skewed to help President Barack Obama, a look into how the figures are calculated will prove you wrong.Read Post | Comments (2,528)Jared Bernstein, 10/05/12Senior Fellow, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesWe\u0027re not yet out of the labor market woods, and I\u0027d like to see us moving more quickly, but we\u0027re on the right path.Read Post | Comments (387)Tod Maffin, 10/05/12President, EngageQ DigitalHere is how each of my weekdays unfolds: I sleep in. I feed my cats. I open my email and deal with it. Then, I start on whatever work is next on my to-do list. Other than keeping a simple flat list of tasks and commitments I\u0027ve made to my clients, I don\u0027t have any big plans, long-term goals, or great desires. I don\u0027t even have priorities or an order to my list of tasks. It is incredibly freeing and I\u0027ve never been happier.Read Post | Comments (71)Robert Scheer, 10/05/12Editor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027It is absurd to depict Wednesday night\u0027s rhetorical stew of superficial nitpicking by two candidates with a proven record of subservience to the Wall Street bandits responsible for wrecking our economy as a meaningful exercise in democratic governance.Read Post | Comments (196)Robert L. Borosage, 10/05/12President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureEvery politician claims to be for the middle class. But time and time again, the wealthy and the most powerful corporations get the gold and the middle class gets the shaft. So who in the Congress stands on the side of the middle class, and who sits on their backs?Read Post | Comments (92)Mike Lux, 10/05/12Partner, Democracy PartnersDespite what you are hearing from Romney a month out from the election, he has not suddenly turned into FDR. Read his platform. Listen to what he says in private with his closest (and richest) friends. This is who he really is, and no amount of fantasyland math is going to change all that.Read Post | Comments (56)Marshall Fine, 10/05/12Author and film critic, hollywoodandfine.comHow much bad luck can one family have?

Talbott, 10/05/12Author, \"Survival Investing: How to Prosper Amid Thieving Banks and Corrupt Governments\"As I said in my last post, when investing clients tell their stockbrokers that they want to minimize their risk to world events, brokers typically suggest that they increase their holdings of bonds and decrease their common stock holdings. In today\u0027s world, this is terribly misguided advice.Read Post | Comments (40)Paul Brandeis Raushenbush, 10/03/12Senior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostAfter a tumultuous decade that featured death threats and bullet-proof vests as well as a wedding to his partner of 25 years, Bishop Gene Robinson will be stepping down from his seat on December 31 of this year.
