For example, we have Little League teams, Fourth of July neighborhood parades and our own weird kind of hot dog called a \"half smoke.\" But the most convincing evidence of our Americanness is that we cherish a beat-up old bar called The Tune Inn, only three blocks from the Capitol on Pennsylvania Ave. And if you are a political junkie and follow the news in Washington you know that the Beltway world came to a screeching halt Wednesday morning when news broke that there was a fire there.Read Post | CommentsJim Wallis, 06.22.2011Christian leader for social changeWe recognize that legitimate ethical and moral issues are at stake in Afghanistan, but we humbly believe there is a better way than war to address these important issues.Read Post | CommentsKathleen Reardon, 06.22.2011Professor, USC Marshall School; Author, \u0027The Secret Handshake and Comebacks At Work\u0027Critical argument in the U.S. media is no longer about seeking truth to correct or sustain our formative values; rather it is about winning so that others might lose. How do we find a way back?Read Post | CommentsCaryl Rivers, 06.22.2011Professor of Journalism at Boston UniversityWomen are acutely aware of a deep unease among men of the combination of female sexuality and power that stretches far back into history. Women in positions of power are not necessarily more virtuous than men -- they are just a lot more scared and careful.Read Post | CommentsJames Peron, 06.22.2011President, Moorfield Storey InstituteThe Christian Post claims that \"57 percent of New York voters oppose gay marriage.\" But the one key variable that determines this is whom you poll.Read Post | CommentsJason Linkins, 06.22.2011Editor, Eat the PressHere\u0027s some good news for people who work in broadcast television: the 2012 campaign season is ramping up, and it seems that your sector of the economy is about to be stimulated. By billions of terrible political ads!Read Post | CommentsGro Brundtland, 06.22.2011Former Prime Minister of Norway; Director-General, World Health OrganizationWhen I became the head of the World Health Organization in 1998, I was dismayed to see the reality of global health up close.Read Post | CommentsRichard (RJ) Eskow, 06.22.2011Consultant, Writer, Senior Fellow with The Campaign for America\u0027s FutureThe inevitable result of austerity economics would be a plan to hand the next generation a nation with crumbling infrastructure, collapsing government services, and bleak economic prospects. It\u0027s an all-out assault on the future of the young.Read Post | CommentsDr. Peggy Drexler, 06.22.2011Author, \u0027Our Fathers Ourselves. Daughters, Fathers, And The Changing American Family\u0027As daughters make more room for fathers in their lives, does that mean less room for mothers? Love is all embracing. But in the lives of young girls, emotional attention span is often limited. You can only roll your eyes at one parent at a time.Read Post | CommentsRhoda P. Curtis, 06.22.2011Author, \"Rhoda: Her First Ninety Years,\" \"After Ninety: What\"I have been thinking about what it means to \"age gracefully\" and I wonder whose opinion seems to matter. Does the aging person feel \"ungraceful\"? Or is the person viewing the aging person deciding whether or not the aging person is graceful or not?Read Post | CommentsJared Bernstein, 06.22.2011Senior Fellow, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesIn today\u0027s global, low-union world, the working man and woman really have no better friend than full employment. It\u0027s one of the only and best ways I know to relink growth and middle-class prosperity. And we\u0027re currently nowhere near it.Read Post | CommentsJoseph Smigelski, 06.22.2011College English Instructor in Northern CaliforniaThere is a great divide in this country where none should be. I\u0027m talking about the perceived rift between science and religion. There\u0027s no real conflict, just one manufactured by manipulative ideologues.Read Post | CommentsEvelyn Leopold, 06.22.2011Veteran reporter at the United NationsSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon\u0027s re-election process is complete. The question is whether he is good at his job and most agree he is, despite a low-profile that can work to his disadvantage.Read Post | CommentsJamie Court, 06.22.2011Author,The Progressive\u0027s Guide To Raising Hell/President Consumer WatchdogIt\u0027s ironic that a company whose mission is to open information to the world would dodge an opportunity for openness and transparency on its own doings with the American people and their Congress.Read Post | CommentsRobert Scheer, 06.22.2011Editor of Truthdig.com, Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027Bill Clinton\u0027s Newsweek cover story shows that the man has long been convinced that there is no problem or contradiction of his that cannot be simply plastered over with blather. Sadly, he may be right.Read Post | CommentsRabbi Steven Greenberg, 06.22.2011Director of Orthodox Programs, Nehirim: GLBT Jewish Culture \u0026 SpiritualityThe state cannot choose to reject these marriages any more than it can reject marriages that I, as an Orthodox rabbi, would not perform because one partner is a Jew and another a Christian.Read Post | CommentsAshwin Madia, 06.22.2011Interim Chairman of VoteVets.orgWar can\u0027t be strategized on compromise, trying to make everyone happy.

The trends are disturbing, to say the least, and curbing them will take a concerted effort by parents, schools, elected officials, and especially the private sector.Read Post | CommentsTherese Borchard, 06.22.2011Author of the blog, Beyond Blue, on Beliefnet.comEven though most folks lump compulsive hoarding into the same illness umbrella as obsessive-compulsive disorder, hoarders actually have different brains.Read Post | CommentsJake Whitney, 06.22.2011Freelance journalist and contributing writer for Guernica MagazineThere was a time when the media was more rational about sex. Throughout most of the twentieth century, in fact, the press maintained a gentlemen\u0027s agreement with politicians that prevented salacious stories of their sexcapades from public circulation.Read Post | CommentsAndrew Brandt, 06.22.2011President, The National Football PostAs the optimistic drumbeat continues towards eventual resolution of the long-running labor dispute between the NFL owners and players, we are starting to hear reports of what an eventual Collective Bargaining Agreement will look like.Read Post | CommentsMarshall Fine, 06.22.2011Author and film critic, hollywoodandfine.comIf the title of Bad Teacher calls to mind Bad Santa, the resonance is deliberate: Here is a comedy full of inappropriate humor about someone filling a familiar role who couldn\u0027t be further from the figure of benevolent authority we expect.Read Post | CommentsWenonah Hauter, 06.21.2011Executive Director, Food \u0026 Water WatchI almost gagged on my coffee when I finally got around to reading the corporate sponsored pro-fracking propaganda by MIT on natural gas.
