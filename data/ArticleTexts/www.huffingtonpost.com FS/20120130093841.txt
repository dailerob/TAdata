{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The activation of the administration\u0027s long dormant task force on criminal misconduct in the financial collapse, with New York\u0027s progressive attorney general Eric Schneiderman as co-chair, could be the most fateful political and economic development of the election year. There are still immense pitfalls ahead, as Wall Street allies inside the administration and on Wall Street itself try to reduce Schneiderman\u0027s role to that of symbolic fig leaf. Given the administration\u0027s feeble record on prosecutions to date, the critics are right to flag the likelihood that people like Attorney General Eric Holder and SEC enforcement chief Robert Khazumi will try to sandbag Schneiderman. But my reporting suggests that they underestimate both the man and the dynamics that have been set loose.Read Post | Comments (70)Dylan Ratigan, 1/29/12Host, MSNBC\u0027s \u0027The Dylan Ratigan Show\u0027; Author, \u0027Greedy Bastards\u0027; Founder, Get Money Out FoundationThis week, I\u0027m pleased to bring you an important discussion about what we should be talking about this election season.
