{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, National Iranian American CouncilThe right wing pro-Israel forces seem to be falling on their swords. They are learning that Senator Chuck Hagel is the wrong guy to pick a fight with. Though the battle is not yet over, the unprecedented push-back against their vicious campaign to prevent Hagel from being nominated is gaining steam. His prospective nomination should never have been controversial in the first place. Hagel is a highly respected military mind who served both in the military and in the Senate with dignity and courage. This earned him several military honors, including two Purple Hearts. And it is worth noting that while America\u0027s relationship with Israel is important, Hagel is being considered for Secretary of Defense of the United States of America, not Israel. Whether Hagel would be good for Israel or not cannot be a central concern -- and certainly not the cause to preemptively slander and dismiss this decorated soldier.Read Post | Comments (90)Bill Moyers, 12/26/12Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyIt\u0027s easy enough to compile a \"best\" and \"worst\" list, but what about bringing attention to important issues that went largely unreported in 2012?

Carolyn Maloney, 12/27/12U.S. Representative for New York\u0027s 14th DistrictIf guns kept Americans safe, then America would surely be the safest country in the whole world.
