{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027It\u0027s time to abolish credit default swaps and similar exotic, impenetrable, essentially unregulated securities. They add nothing to economic efficiency, they line bankers\u0027 pockets, and they add massively to global financial risks. Swaps were only invented in the 1990s. Before swaps, investors were perfectly capable of evaluating risks -- and there was less systemic risk to evaluate. The entire banking system is overdue for a drastic simplification that puts banks back in their legitimate business of evaluating risks and then holding onto them, rather than passing the hot potato to someone else. This will require a revolutionary power shift, and it is one the Occupy Wall Street protests are already promoting.Read Post | Comments (315)Marlo Thomas, 10/31/11Award-winning actress, author and activistIn case you need reminding from when you were a kid -- kids keep secrets from their parents.

As Herman Cain still says \"if you don\u0027t have a job and you\u0027re not rich, blame yourself.\" But Cain\u0027s line isn\u0027t hitting a responsive chord.Read Post | Comments (160)Dean Baker, 10/31/11Co-Director of CEPR; Author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027The supercommittee doesn\u0027t want to think about a proposal that would impose serious costs on Wall Street. It is more interested in taking away Social Security and Medicare benefits from the old and disabled.Read Post | Comments (122)Wayne Besen, 10/31/11Founder, Truth Wins OutLet me put it in simplistic branding language that Cain might comprehend: Don\u0027t bill yourself as a pepperoni pizza if you are actually a submarine sandwich.Read Post | CommentsSen.

Lee Sarokin, 10/31/11Retired in 1996 after 17 years on the federal benchIf Cain is not guilty of sexual harassment, the fact that it was alleged against him and settled should play no part in his candidacy.Read Post | CommentsMJ Rosenberg, 10/31/11Senior Foreign Policy Fellow, Media Matters Action NetworkIt was bound to happen sooner or later.

The views of the American people who -- across party lines and all demographics -- consistently say \"do not cut Social Security,\" \"Do not cut Medicare\" lack standing in this policy discussion.Read Post | CommentsLauren Bravo, 10/31/11Senior Writer and professional eater for Channel 4 Food, and columnist for the Worthing Herald SeriesSomewhere between the Thriller video and Kitty Brucknell humping that dartboard, Halloween became the get-out-of-slutty-free card - a chance for nice, normal girls with a tasteful line in Uniqlo cardigans to crank their assets up to their chin and embrace their slaggy alter egos for a night.Read Post | Comments (152)David Frum, 10/31/11Editor, FrumForum.comWhat Europe must do to save the euro is very similar to what Alexander Hamilton did in the United States in the 1790s to create the dollar.
