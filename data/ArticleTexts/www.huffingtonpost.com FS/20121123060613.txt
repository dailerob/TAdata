{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, the harried prep for Thanksgiving unofficially marks the opening of the Stress Season that will last through New Year\u0027s Day, when we can officially start feeling guilty about breaking the resolutions we\u0027ll make in response to the stress-induced overindulgence of the holiday season. So how do we change things and give ourselves the gift of mastering our stress instead of being slaves to it? The key is to prioritize not letting stress turn the holidays from a time of renewal to a time of frenzy. \"Everything changed the day she figured out there was exactly enough time for the important things in her life,\" writes the artist Brian Andreas. So this is the perfect moment -- right before it all starts -- to slow down and reflect on how we can turn a time that so often becomes a time of high anxiety into a time of generosity, celebration, and coming together.Read Post | Comments (48)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 11/22/12Author, research psychologist and gender scholarThis Thanksgiving, you might not be able to control any one else at the table, but you can maintain your own civility, and sanity, and make it through a holiday in which feelings don\u0027t get hurt, slurs don\u0027t get thrown, and relatives aren\u0027t forced to intervene.Read Post | Comments (67)Bill Maher, 11/21/12Host of HBO\u0027s \"Real Time with Bill Maher\"I have been mostly holding my tongue about the president this past season, because I didn\u0027t want to muddy the waters in a country where you only get two choices. But Mr. President, there\u0027s no third term, so you may as well throw caution to the wind.Read Post | Comments (634)Amy Ephron, 11/21/12AuthorHas anyone noticed that there\u0027s no debate this year? To stuff or not to stuff... To brine or not to brine... Yes, you can fast-cook a turkey at high-heat but should you? I think we all have debate fatigue; election fatigue; Washington gridlock fatigue -- and it\u0027s all somehow spilled over into Thanksgiving.Read Post | Comments (56)Bob Cesca, 11/21/12Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez Show, Media ProducerWe\u0027ve all known a kid who upon losing a board game would freak out, hurl the game across the room and storm off while shouting something like, \"This game sucks anyway!\" It\u0027s no surprise the Republicans are doing exactly that.Read Post | Comments (861)Grover Norquist, 11/21/12President, Americans for Tax ReformFirst, we can and should demand that the negotiations between Congress and the White House be done in front of C-SPAN cameras.

As we give thanks, let\u0027s also stand for children who need our voice.Read Post | Comments (24)Rev. Dr. Randy S. Woodley, 11/22/12Distinguished Associate Professor of Faith and Culture, Director of Intercultural and Indigenous Studies, George Fox SeminaryMany of my fellow Native Americans who view the holiday as a national day of mourning, will not celebrate Thanksgiving at all.
