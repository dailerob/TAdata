{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week delivered more attempts by the White House and Eric Holder at damage control over revelations of search warrants involving the AP and a Fox News reporter. Though outrage over the administration\u0027s overly aggressive approach to leaks is certainly justified (indeed, HuffPost has called for Holder to step down), the indignation coming from Republicans is DC hypocrisy at its worst. If they\u0027re truly disturbed by eavesdropping on the press, where was their outrage when George Bush wanted the power to eavesdrop on everybody using the NSA\u0027s warrantless wiretapping program? If they\u0027re so outraged about the politicization of the Justice Department, where were they when the Bush White House was involved in the firing of nine U.S. attorneys? Or when Karl Rove\u0027s deputy was giving a PowerPoint presentation to Government Services Administration employees on ways to help GOP candidates? As Milan Kundera wrote, \"The struggle of man against power is the struggle of memory against forgetting.\"Comments (162)Mika BrzezinskiCo-host of MSNBC’s \"Morning Joe\"Somewhat aspirational. I loved it. Didn\u0027t know what it meant. But I found it to be hilarious and cuttingly honest, which I admire. I considered getting a T-shirt with the words typed out across my chest.Comments (97)Peter S. GoodmanExecutive Business Editor, The Huffington PostIf workers now earning $8 an hour inside warehouses or at fast-food counters manage to get more pay, they are not going to hide the extra money in the Cayman Islands or leave it to their heirs via elaborate trusts. They will go out and spend it almost immediately, boosting their local economies.Comments (1,881)David GalloOceanographerTo date we\u0027ve explored less than 5 percent of the world beneath the waves. So what\u0027s in the other 95 percent? Is it possible that by some chance we\u0027ve already found all of the exciting stuff, or is the ocean full of surprises?Comments (480)Arianna HuffingtonWhat we need is a more humane and more sustainable definition of success that includes well-being, wisdom, wonder, empathy, and the ability to give back. And women will have to lead the way.Comments (147)Gary HartPresident, Hart International, Ltd.If you are locked into an ideology that government is bad, you have a stake in proving that to be the case. Whether a gridlock-committed Republican party will pay a price for opposing the will of the people remains to be seen. It\u0027s up to the American people to decide what they want.Comments (548)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundA law requiring Levi Reed\u0027s grandfather to store his gun safely might have saved Noah McGuire\u0027s life. Enough is enough. It is time for responsible citizens everywhere to stand up to the gun lobby and demand that politicians pass common sense gun safety and safe storage laws.Comments (695)Mitchell BardWriter and FilmmakerRepublicans in the Senate are abusing the filibuster to keep jobs -- in both the executive and judicial branches -- unfilled while sitting idly by and letting economic growth take a hit in the name of ideology.Comments (803)Sheryl SandbergChief Operating Officer, FacebookNo matter what route you choose personally, I am writing to appeal to you to take on a critically important cause that will improve the lives of all: building a more equal world.Comments (218)Norman LearFounder, People for the American WayCan I reach deeply enough inside me now to express how much that, the idea and Jean Stapleton herself, has meant to me?Comments (95)Russell BrandActor and comedianExtremists on both sides have a shared agenda: division, distrust, anger and violence. The answer is not for us to move further from one another, crouched in opposing fortresses constructed from vindictive words. We need now to move closer to one another, to understand one another.Comments (1,154)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistAs the summer begins to really heat up, many of you may be thinking of heating up the barbecue too. I\u0027ve always found that a little bit of planning can take a perfectly nice meal outside to the next level and make it a truly memorable event.Comments (149)William BaldwinActorThis shot over the bow of wrestling from the IOC could be the wakeup call we have been waiting for. Never before have I witnessed more outrage, more passion, and more interest for our beloved sport.Comments (125)Melissa MohrAuthorOnce upon a time, the English population was decimated by the plague. The King was so concerned about the shrinking number of his subjects that he ordered his people to reproduce.Comments (294)Tom GreenComedian, actor and Internet pioneerThank you Steve Jobs, and Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerberg for making Schadenfreude convenient. It\u0027s as if we are enjoying the spectacle so much that we haven\u0027t noticed the cameras are now pointed at us. Who is laughing now?Comments (271)Brittney GrinerWNBA playerSince being drafted a little over a month ago by the Phoenix Mercury, life has certainly been a whirlwind. I\u0027ve been from the East coast to the West coast on media tours, have done countless interviews and met a lot of new people -- and I\u0027ve loved every minute of it.Comments (30)Bill McKibbenAuthor of a dozen books, including \u0027The End of Nature\u0027 and \u0027Deep Economy\u0027You need to see this: Former Obama administration green jobs advisor Van Jones just came out swinging against Keystone XL. Van doesn\u0027t just raise the stakes, he debunks the outright myths that are leading our nation down a road to disaster.Comments (302)Valerie JarrettSenior Advisor and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsIf you are willing to be flexible, you will find your true passion. So don\u0027t restrict your options, and limit your potential, with arbitrary, self-imposed deadlines. But be ready to push yourself beyond your comfort zone, and to be resilient.Comments (49)Harvey FiersteinMultiple Tony-Award-winning actorWhen we excuse homophobia as a matter of opinion instead of treating it as a destructive social illness, we invite fear to explode into violence. How often are the perpetrators of hate crimes discovered to be self-loathing? Valued individuals do not strike out against strangers.Comments (252)Lisa FirestonePsychology expert on relationships, parenting, self-destructive thoughts and suicide; author, \u0027Conquer Your Critical Voice\u0027Mindfulness presents a valuable tool for facing the daily challenges of staying close to our partner. It allows us to become more centered and calm, so we can talk things out instead of spiraling into a screaming match.CommentsRoss LuippoldHuffPost Comedy Deputy EditorThe unenthusiastic reaction that many had for the show is not due to Mitch Hurwitz and his co-conspirators\u0027 failure to deliver, but instead, can be placed squarely on the knee-jerk reaction of an online crowd that favors the idea of reunions and revivals over delivery of them.Comments (93)Jackie Morgan MacDougallWriter/Producer/On-Air PersonalityWe try to teach our daughters to love their bodies, no matter the size. We want to empower girls to respect themselves. But how can we teach them to make strong, independent decisions about their own selves when society, peers (and yes, even parents) are sending mixed messages?Comments (1,042)Alex CastellanosRepublican media consultantTimes have changed. Our government hasn\u0027t. New Republicans believe we can fix that and, in so doing, make America young again. The government won\u0027t be fixed by itself. It needs smart, young leaders to tackle the problems this nation currently faces.Comments (186)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarIf you believe the surveys -- and parse all they commentary they create -- successful working women must find balance, as they lean forward, peering up at the glass ceiling, looking over their shoulders at coming competitors in an environment that is not nearly as sisterly as we assumed.Comments (29)Jonathan TurleyProfessor of Public Interest Law, George Washington UniversityEric Holder\u0027s feeble response was the ultimate proof that these are Obama\u0027s sins despite his effort to feign ignorance.Comments (350)Laura CococciaEditor, \u0027The Journal of Cultural Conversation\u0027It\u0027s not that difficult to think of sugar as a habit, or even a minor pleasurable addiction. Anyone who has ever craved a chocolate cake -- or, in the case of me as I write this, a blueberry smoothie -- knows that the craving of sugar can be highly irritating.Comments (114)Tim FerrissAuthor, \u0027The 4-Hour Workweek\u0027\"We\u0027ve all heard of acai, goji berries and chia seeds. But I\u0027d be willing to bet most of you are unfamiliar with more than a few of these more obscure superfoods.\"Comments (70)Pharrell Williams and Connie YowellThe days of unequal access to high quality educators, schools in crisis and communities feeling powerless to support them are soon coming to an end.Comments (36)Glennon MeltonBlogger, MomasteryThe work of a mother is repetitive. We fold the clothes, we wash the bowls, and we sing the same song and read the same bedtime story night after night. But that work is our prayer.Comments (23)Jon SoltzCo-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranIf a U.S. senator can unwittingly pose for pictures with terrorists in Syria, how can we guarantee that the arms McCain supports sending there won\u0027t also end up in the same place McCain did -- with terrorists?Comments (222)Michael T. KlareAuthor and Professor of Peace and World-Security Studies, Hampshire CollegeDid Washington just give Israel the green light for a future attack on Iran via an arms deal? Did Russia just signal its further support for Bashar al-Assad\u0027s Syrian regime via an arms deal?Comments (66)Martin Luz, 2013. 2.06Mark I.
