{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"TED and HuffPost are planning an exciting experiment in the weeks ahead. We want to highlight some of today\u0027s most intriguing ideas. But to do so in a way that sees those ideas morph and develop in real time, in response to input from thousands of contributors, perhaps including you. Every weekend for the next year, we\u0027ll introduce a theme, anchored to a TEDTalk we think has at its core a powerful and timely concept. But rather than simply offering it up as is, we\u0027re opening it up to you to write your own post about it, leave a comment behind, and help refine it. Because that\u0027s the thing about ideas. They\u0027re not set in stone. When exposed to thoughtful people, each of whom may bring an additional insight, they\u0027re capable of adaptation until they find their most potent form. A form that can truly go viral and perhaps impact millions of minds.Read Post | Comments (42)Will.i.am, 11/02/12Musician, technology advocate, and creator/executive producer of i.am FIRST: ScienceI made a new song that\u0027s a reminder of what this election is all about... we are all fighting for a better life... we are all wanting greater opportunities... we are all looking for solutions... we are all hurting wishing and praying for \"Great Times.\"Read Post | Comments (41)Norman Lear, 11/03/12Founder, People for the American WayI\u0027m a story teller. And I keep thinking about the life stories of Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. In some ways, both are right out of the American storybook. Of course, some of the details would indicate that the truth can be bent.Read Post | CommentsBrian Goldman, MD, 10/15/12Author, \u0027The Night Shift\u0027Since January of this year, more than half a million people have seen my talk. A small number of people have (rightly) taken me to task for not doing better. But most have been incredibly supportive of my call for health professionals to talk openly about their mistakes.Read Post | Comments (604)Tyre Nelson, 11/03/12U.S. Navy VeteranSince day one President Obama has shown steady leadership and outlined a clear vision for an America that is strong at home and abroad. He understands what our service men and women have given and he\u0027s working tirelessly to honor our country\u0027s commitment to that sacrifice.Read Post | Comments (287)Chris Greenberg, 11/03/12Sports Editor, The Huffington PostWith the cancelation of the NYC Marathon there are now upwards of 40,000 able-bodied and strong-willed individuals in the New York area who can still put all of these attributes to good use, including me.Read Post | CommentsSimon Jackman, 11/03/12Professor of Political Science, Stanford UniversityPolls released in the second half of the week generally suggested a slight uptick in Obama support, in the national popular vote, battleground states and the Electoral College forecast.Read Post | CommentsTerry O\u0027Neill, 11/03/12President, National Organization for WomenRunning throughout the Romney-Ryan budget is a suspicion that by helping people you make them weaker, that the poor are easily swayed into behaving irresponsibly. The sad thing is, Romney and Ryan are the irresponsible onesRead Post | Comments (15)Robert Redford, 11/02/12Actor, director, and environmental activistIt will take resourcefulness and grit to reduce the carbon pollution that\u0027s fueling these storms, but Hurricane Sandy proves once again we have it. The question is: Will we use it?Read Post | Comments (210)Pee-wee Herman, 11/03/12peewee.comThe last time I went to the Jersey Shore, Mike \"the Situation\" Sorrentino took me for frozen custard. I would buy everyone in the world right now a frozen custard, just so they would realize how special the Jersey Shore is. And then they would donate whatever they could afford to the American Red Cross.Read Post | Comments (64)Matthew Dowd, 11/03/12Political strategistBarack Obama\u0027s reelection would mean the parties will need new leaders and will have to settle internal differences.Read Post | CommentsRabbi Shmuley Boteach, 10/31/12Rabbi and WriterWhat was G-d thinking when he sent Hurricane Sandy and what could have been its purpose? In truth, I don\u0027t much care, because our role as humans is not to understand G-d\u0027s plan in the face of horror and tragedy, but to challenge God and demand that human life always be protected and preserved.Read Post | Comments (325)Helen C. Whitney and Gregory A. Prince, Ph.D., 11/03/12Is Romney the face of Mormonism? Or has he so far distanced himself from core values of his religion that Mormons feel constrained to emphasize that he is not that face?Read Post | Comments (386)Steven M. Anderson, 11/03/12Retired Brigadier General, Chief Marketing Officer at RELYANT LLCI rarely agree with President Obama, and Governor Romney remains my choice for president on other grounds.

It\u0027s an old values debate, begun between the planters who came to these shores in the South and the Pilgrims who came to New England in the 1600s. It continues today, in this election.Read Post | Comments (13)Dr. Dean Ornish, 11/02/12Medical Editor, The Huffington Post; Founder and President, Preventive Medicine Research InstituteThe need for love and intimacy is a fundamental human need, as primal as the need for food, water, and air.
