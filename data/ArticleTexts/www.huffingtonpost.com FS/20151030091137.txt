{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Hofstra Journalism ProfessorBush has seemed uncomfortable since the beginning of his campaign. His body language and frequent gaffes have consistently betrayed a politician who wasn\u0027t fully committed. He has been easily rattled throughout the campaign by taunts from Trump, like calling Bush a \"low-energy\" candidate. Last week, Bush expressed his frustration for the current state of partisan politics. \"If this election is about how we\u0027re going to fight to get nothing done, then I don\u0027t want any part of it.\" Wednesday\u0027s debate was a must-win for Jeb Bush, an opportunity to prove his critics wrong, to seize momentum by demonstrating he could lead the party to victory next November. Instead, his puzzling debate performance lacked passion, fight and self-confidence.In watching the debate, I kept thinking to myself, \"These are the job applicants for the position of CEO of the World.\" Yet there was more carnival barking on the stage than insights or observations about the economy or economic policy.Senior Fellow at New America, author of \"Raw Deal: How the \u0027Uber Economy\u0027 and Runaway Capitalism Are Screwing American Workers\"For far too long, guns have been a third-rail issue not only for politicians, but for celebrities, too. It is time we consider that artists are people, too, and they often share a common sense of personal responsibility through their work to inspire others. Let\u0027s stand behind cultural icons to do just that.Daughter of Sandy Hook survivor, student activist for safer communities, gun violence prevention advocateThe occupation is not sustainable; it is costly both in blood and treasure, Israel\u0027s national security will remain at risk, and the country will become ever more internationally isolated while risking its very identity as a Jewish state.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUIt must be easy to sleep after a debate, knowing that your supporters won\u0027t fact-check you, because you\u0027ve thoroughly convinced them that it\u0027s the fact-checkers who lie.Technology Analyst at R/GAAn Army judge at Guantanamo Bay on Thursday refused to allow one of the five defendants charged with orchestrating the 9/11 attacks to dismiss his lead lawyer, ruling the accused hadn\u0027t shown the necessary \"good cause\" to do so.Senior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstThe third Republican presidential primary debate was a sprawling, messy affair that played out more as a battle between candidates and moderators than an exchange among the debaters. At this point the key problem is the sheer number of human beings on stage.Professor of Journalism, Northeastern University, BostonIt\u0027s easy to say it\u0027s \"just a costume,\" and at the end of the night, you can take it off. But we can\u0027t take off our transness, and we will continue having to live with the consequences of the subtle, casual hatred your costume embodies.Vlogger, Indie Model, Trans Advocate, Nerd, Artist, Musician, Proud Feminist SlutBreaches, and the identity theft that flows from them, have become the third certainty in life, right behind death and taxes. Your introduction to the fact that you got \"got\" can take many forms.Author of Swiped. Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and IDT911Even though Queen Mother Catherine de Medici\u0027s reputation as a ruthless poisoner seems broadly known, the residents of the French court eagerly accept or even solicit gifts from her, which inevitably turn out to be fatal. It seems likely that Paul Ryan\u0027s election as House Speaker will prove to be just such a poisoned chaliceFormer executive director and chairman, Sierra ClubSpecial interest money is flooding into our state Supreme Court elections, gravely threatening the impartial justice that our Constitution promises -- and raising troubling questions about whether courtroom decisions are for sale.Senior Counsel, Brennan Center for Justice Democracy ProgramPolicy Counsel and Research Analyst, Justice at StakeFroman isn\u0027t, as a British reader might casually assume, a minister whose views carry independent weight because he is an important politician in the ruling majority. He is, rather, a recent political appointee charged with a narrow, but demanding task: overseeing the complex negotiations for two ambitious new trade agreements that President Obama has made the centerpiece of his final term.Associate Professor of Law, Yale Law SchoolIf you\u0027re opposed to something that is now a right of every American and has been proven in court -- in the federal trial over California\u0027s Proposition 8 -- to harm no one, including children, then you do have an irrational fear of homosexuality.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostWe ought not to be blinded by media theater, or by habits of dismissing the doubts, and even the deaths, of countless people just like ourselves, overseas, whenever our government offers us its unsubstantiated explanations, its sincere good will, its apologies.Co-coordinator, Voices for Creative Nonviolence\"It\u0027s the humane thing to do,\" said a participant following an emergency donor class conference call following the CNBC Republican debate in Boulder, Colo. \"After Jeb criticized Rubio\u0027s attendance record, and Rubio broke his legs, you could just see it in his eyes.\"USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorMake no bones about it, so far this has been a bizarre American century. To get a full frontal sense of what that means, however, let\u0027s return to late September 2001.Editor, TomDispatch.comIf it is frightening to Dr. Carson that I want equality, then he is being irrational. If he views my desire to be equal as divisive and merely an aspect of \"PC culture,\" that makes little sense. If he believes that wanting to be treated equally under the law is provoking some sort of war, making enemies and destroying this nation, then he is not thinking clearly.Professor of Theater, Ursinus CollegeMost of these new arrivals, while thankful for reaching dry land safely, are exhausted, wet and frightened. IRC counselors and translators do their best to address their concerns and answer questions. Some of the most common questions aid workers get are also the most unexpected.Emergency Communications Officer for the International Rescue CommitteeWe must not forget that the profit we make today is responsible for the environmental refugees of tomorrow.Senior scientist, authorMcCain, by using his power as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee to pressure the Department of Defense to back off a legitimate investigation of the University of Phoenix, is doing a disservice to service members and veterans, who deserve to be protected against deceptive recruiting, poor quality programs, and other predatory practices.Attorney, advocate, writer at RepublicReport.orgWhat the fishbowl that is our nation\u0027s capital doesn\u0027t get is that, despite their greatest wish that outsiders will fade away in favor of traditional order, GOP base voters still want their ice cream. They want the candidate who is most likely to upend order in Washington, not sustain it. They want that gratification, not someone who will work the system with incremental changes.Public Relations Consultant, www.winningprogressive.comTo say that religion is divisive is to attempt no analysis of the problems at hand. It is to stop at the surface making no effort to dig deeper for the underlying problems seething underneath.British Tunisian writer and Middle East expertAs physicians concerned with maintaining humane medical standards, we know that it is critically important to learn all we can about the psychological and historical conditions conducive to medical evil.Author, \u0027Witness to an Extreme Century: A Memoir\u0027 and \u0027The Nazi Doctors: Medical Killing and the Psychology of Genocide\u0027Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and Professor of Medicine, University of California Riverside School of MedicineSince Hurricane Sandy made landfall, the national dialogue about recovery and resilience has shifted. The Obama Administration has led the Federal government in integrating resilience into the fabric of how we build, rebuild, plan and prepare for the impacts of climate change. However, the stakes continue to grow.Director of the Office of Management and BudgetSupport your candidate. Sing his praises to the sky. But remember that the primary is not the whole game. In fact, remember that this is not a game. That this is not about your guy winning. This is about making our country -- all of it, in a lot of different arenas -- a better place.Writer at DenofGeek.com and PsychoDriveIn.comWe of course can\u0027t be satisfied just growing OGP and growing the model. We\u0027ve got to keep this organization fluid and vibrant and responsive to what citizens are asking for around the world.U.S. Permanent Representative to the United NationsThe country is in a fundamentally different place than it was 15 years ago when the Supreme Court handed George W. Bush the White House. If Kasich is able to win the Republican nomination -- that will be tough since GOP voters have no appetite for emotions other than anger -- his attempts at expressing empathy in the fall will be unconvincing when Americans learn about his record in Ohio.Syndicated Columnist and Longtime Political StrategistThere is a difference between being inspired by an indigenous culture and appropriating it, especially while that culture is very much alive; which brings me to the endless stream of Pocahotties and headdresses seen at almost every Halloween party or street parade.Native American/British, Feminist, IS/Transgender AdvocateA successful investor for half a century, Carl Icahn knows where to put his money. And right now our political system is so receptive to the whims of the wealthy and so deaf to the needs of working people, he knows his best investment is in pushing that advantage even further.Executive Director, Americans for Tax FairnessUniversities have the experts. As a result of decades of government investment in basic research -- in fields such as computing, medicine, sensors, artificial intelligence, digital manufacturing, robotics, nanomaterials, and synthetic biology -- they have an abundance of talent and intellectual property. This is a goldmine for industry.Academic, Researcher, Writer, EntrepreneurWednesday night\u0027s Republican presidential debate brings to mind one of the most memorable TV snafus in history: the 27-minute loss of audio during the first presidential debate between incumbent Republican President Gerald Ford and Democratic challenger Jimmy Carter.Senior writer, BillMoyers.com.
