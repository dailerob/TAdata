{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Paul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostGiving everyone the benefit of the doubt, it is true that our country is undergoing some profound changes in demographics. We are more religiously and culturally diverse than ever before and this diversity will automatically evoke some strong reactions. Plus, we have a rising population that does not feel affiliated with any religious tradition and this too contributes to the new cultural landscape. So, it is not surprising that those used to Christianity being the dominant religion in America feel unease in this new reality. So, consider this a primer to help all of us \u0027just get along\u0027 during this \u0027holiday season.\u0027CommentsBen OrlinMath teacher, tutor, artistOur World: Still No Scientific Consensus on Global Warming Mathematically Literate World: Still 90 Percent Scientific Consensus on Global WarmingCommentsMark ParisManaging Director and Head of Financial Products and Corporate Partnerships, Citi Municipal Markets DivisionKirsten Saenz Tobey and Kristin Groos Richmond are the co-founders of Revolution Foods, a company that is tackling the challenge of the more than 20 million Americans who lack access to healthy food.
