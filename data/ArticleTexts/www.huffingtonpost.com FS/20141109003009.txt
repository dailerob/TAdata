Each will, in due course, be called upon to testify before Congress as to the progress they are making in their mission. Neither will earn an additional star if he reports back that his charges are militarily incapable of achieving the optimistic objectives set forth by the Obama administration. Congress can anticipate that each of these men, and any others they call upon to testify, will provide them with the sort of pat answers one has come to expect from such hearings. But void of meaningful political change in both Iraq and within the political leadership of the \"Free Syrian Army,\" there will be no cause in either of those countries worthy of the sacrifice of the men America plans to train to fight in the spring offensive of 2015.Bloodshed in Europe and the Middle East against the backdrop of a breakdown in the dialogue between major powers is of enormous concern. The world is on the brink of a new Cold War. Some are even saying that it\u0027s already begun.Former President of Soviet Union, Nobel LaureateConflicts in faraway places matter in various ways to the United States. These conflicts matter because we recognize that violence within any particular country can quickly cause national and regional instability, displacing millions of people, upending markets.U.S. Ambassador to the United NationsAs pundits and partisans alike are tallying the winners and losers of this year\u0027s contests, they should not forget to consider that the real winners were the campaign media consultants and the owners of local television stations, both of whom pocketed hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising revenues.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Let\u0027s hope rich kids will find their way.

But the true victims in this story -- the mountain gorillas of Virunga -- are hard to see as anything other than innocent quarry of machinations far beyond their ken.Award-Winning filmmakerWhile this film\u0027s premise is overdrawn, the idea that our descendants may feel compelled to fly the terrestrial coop isn\u0027t nuts. Nor is it the movie\u0027s greatest fictional leap. That honor belongs to the choice of destination.Senior Astronomer, SETI InstituteTomorrow, I will miss the bonding experience that is nursing my baby.

The Republican campaign message was simply: vote against President Obama. Here\u0027s what we should be talking about.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersThe inadequacy of words that console is exacerbated when a child takes his or her own life. It\u0027s a loss that adds the additional burdens of unbearable remorse and unanswered questions to already grieving parents; the general ambiguity heightens the pain and prolongs the grieving process.Partner, Sensei Marketing; Author, Influence MarketingThe GOP\u0027s dogged vow to hamstring Obama with the tag of a go-it-his-way president and further straightjacket his presidency poses the real likelihood that Lynch could be on the GOP\u0027s hot seat. If so, the issue again will not be Lynch, but Obama.Author and political analystOn Election night, 2014, as campaign spending records were shattered and Jon Stewart declared \"Money\" the big winner, the people of Tallahassee, Florida lit a beacon of hope for the rest of the nation.Director, Represent.UsAn adopted person can -- sometimes -- be fortunate enough to find the identity of their biological mother and father through one of the major commercial DNA tests available today.

In a formal way, they of course have. The public did vote. But in a substantive way, it\u0027s not true that they have chosen their government. This was the billionaires\u0027 election, billionaires of both parties.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia UniversityPresident Franklin Roosevelt once said, \"There is nothing so American as our national parks.... The fundamental idea behind the parks...is that the country belongs to the people.\" If you have yet to explore \"your\" parks -- there are 401 of them -- then Veterans Day is just the excuse you need.Where to go, stay and play on your next great vacation.Your Social Security number is a skeleton key in the hands of an identity thief, but it\u0027s not just about money.

That perception is generally true, but it\u0027s not entirely that simple.Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersWe like to think that somewhere, in each state, there\u0027s a truly sublime pie, and to prove that point, we\u0027ve crunched the numbers (and the crusts) and come up with a definitive list of the best pizzerias in every corner of this great nation.Everything worth caring about in food, drink, and travelFashion PhotographerSixty percent of Internet users said they witnessed someone being called offensive names; 53 percent have seen efforts to purposefully embarrass someone; and 24 percent witnessed someone being harassed for a sustained period of timeWriter and lecturerSo many children need help escaping the poverty and violence and homelessness and unequal schools that are setting them up to fail.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundIf Republicans emphatically do not want to cooperate in any meaningful way with Democrats, is there anything Obama can do to change that?
