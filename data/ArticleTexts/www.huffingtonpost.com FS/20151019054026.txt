Take the email scandal (please). As Bernie Sanders pointed out during the CNN debate, in an uncharacteristic moment of courtliness, people are sick of it.

For far too many, the struggle continues, especially for communities of color where economic inequality persists and the availability of good paying jobs remains a scare commodity.Supervisor for the Second District of Los Angeles CountyOnly after living in South Africa have I been able to truly humanize my understanding of America\u0027s, and therefore my own, discrimination. For the first time, I see the greatness of the American dream clearly: deflated by moral contradiction.WondererI am struck again and again by how many families say they were not fully informed about the range of perinatal emotional complications that they may experience, even though these complications are known to be a common consequence of pregnancy.Supporting and Empowering MothersIf China fails to turbocharge its capacity to innovate, the country will experience a hard economic landing and social stability will be threatened.
