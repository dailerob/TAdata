{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Authors, \u0027Going to Tehran\u0027; Penn State Professor and American University Senior LecturerNo doubt, Obama and his White House advisers think they are handling difficult domestic political dynamics with admirable adroitness. But, in diplomatic terms, their approach assumes that other key players -- including Iran -- will wait indefinitely for Washington to get serious about closing a deal. It also assumes that, if the process breaks down due to a U.S.-induced impasse over terms for a new Security Council resolution, the rest of the world will buy the Obama administration\u0027s narrative that this is Iran and Russia\u0027s fault. Odds that these assumptions will prove false are greater than Obama and his team are ready to acknowledge -- a reality that makes their course strategically irresponsible.Trump certainly acts and sounds like a racial bigot. But whether he really is or not, there is a much deeper issue here -- Donald Trump is a salesman who sees that racial bigotry still works with a core base of the Republican Party.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersWhen reporters covering presidential politics employ words they fully know will disparage female candidates -- or when they purport to discern dishonesty by examining candidates\u0027 facial expressions -- they are taking journalistic prerogative too far.Professor Emerita, USC Marshall School; Author, \u0027The Secret Handshake\u0027 and \u0027Shadow Campus\u0027If, and only if, the U.S. can pivot from a completed deal to a broader regional peace will it be possible to judge the outcome a success. Otherwise it\u0027s \"off to the races\", since a deal without a determined follow-up program may be just a bad as (and maybe worse than) no deal at all.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027My cat is my bae, my eyebrows are #onbleak, and I rejoice when weekend plans are unexpectedly cancelled. At 24, I often feel much closer to a comfortable 62. Fortunately (or unfortunately) I am not alone.Freelance writer and reporterPhotographerIt\u0027s a hypnotically attractive argument. It sounds tough -- more troops! -- but the number is low enough that proponents can claim, with a straight face, that we aren\u0027t repeating the Iraq War all over again. Ten thousand. More than Obama. (\"I\u0027ll be tougher!\") Less than Bush. (\"But I\u0027ve learned my lesson!\") Just right.U.S. Senator from ConnecticutYes, it\u0027s strange but true -- Donald Trump is now a frontrunner for the Republican nomination for president. That\u0027s a pretty breathtaking place for the Republican Party to find itself in, isn\u0027t it? But it cannot be denied.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comThere\u0027s no question that Nixon was a complex figure, but diagnoses of his psyche from afar are theories lacking proof, readings of his soul as well as his mind by people who never knew him.JournalistJust about the least effective way to get kids to \"buy in\" to parental values is to try to force them to do so. Savvy parents, more often than not, come to understand that patience, and a little bit of tongue-biting, wins out.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarAs a longtime employee of the Washington Post Company, I shared the negative, almost cartoonist view of Tricky Dick. But as I got into his extensive papers and the hundreds of oral histories and many of hours of White House tapes, I realized Nixon was a more complex figure.Author, \u0027Being Nixon\u0027Today, you can choose your occupation and your spouse, stack up blocks with big machines, and visit just about any place other than the Mariana Trench. The smart phone in your pocket affords you access to more information than contained in the entire library at Alexandria, in case you occasionally become puzzled or bored. Living in the present: What\u0027s not to like? Only this. We were all born too soon.Senior Astronomer, SETI Institute\"Some parents get sad and angry when their kids are gay.

He helps us fight to keep children and people of color, especially Black boys, out of the Cradle to Prison Pipeline™.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundPresident Obama deserves a big thank you for these designations, and I\u0027ll show you where to do that in a moment. But first, I want to point out that most of the work that went into making these designations possible didn\u0027t happen in Washington, D.C.Executive Director, The Sierra ClubAs I go through the growing pains of becoming a \"real adult,\" I\u0027m realizing that the notion that I\u0027m responsible for everything that comes into my life is absolute, total crap. Sometimes there are things we just shouldn\u0027t apologize for.Healthy Living Editor, The Huffington PostWe assumed Europe\u0027s era of mass killing had ended with World War II; Srebrenica proved us wrong. Srebrenica revealed a terrible truth about the institutions on which the post-War world depends.Member of the Board of the Committee to Protect JournalistsThe drama that played out in Greece this week is of historic importance. What is at stake goes well beyond the future of the eurozone. It is the very essence of the great postwar civilizational compact that brought unprecedented prosperity and political stability to Europe.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghThe Republican Party needs to remember the American ideals of openness to immigrants, religious tolerance and equal opportunity. They need to honor these principles by rejecting the Obama haters. They can begin this task by taking a strong stand against Donald Trump.Research Associate at the Economic Policy InstituteWhether it\u0027s your job, relationship or something else, life is starting to feel a bit too predictable. Everywhere you turn you are seeing more and more people clicking their heels together as they run off to their next big adventure, while you sit back and make excuses about why that can\u0027t be you.Life Coach, Writer, Connector \u0026 lover of life, helping women around the globe live the life of their dreams.Conscious business is not a theory -- it is a way to work and live.
