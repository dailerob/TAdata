{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Merry Christmas, HuffPosters! As is our tradition, we have stuffed our Featured Blog Post stocking with a line-up of holiday inspired offerings. I am spending Christmas in Hawaii with my daughters, my sister, and my ex-husband -- reflecting on the year gone by and following my own advice on reducing holiday stress (if you missed it, you can read the post here). And I am continuing another personal tradition: spending more time today on HuffPost\u0027s Impact and Good News sections, celebrating those committed to making things better, than on our Politics section, fuming over those who are making things worse. I\u0027m also filled with gratitude and counting my blessings, which, along with my family, include our incredible HuffPost community -- our HuffPost team, our bloggers, our commenters, and all of our readers. You have been the greatest gift of all.Read Post | Comments (19)Marian Wright Edelman, 12/24/12President, Children\u0027s Defense FundHelp us to stand up together and speak up together and pray together and act together to make America safe, just and right for all children.Read Post | Comments (17)Joshua Ostroff, 12/24/12Senior editor, Huffington Post CanadaWe\u0027re a proud Chrismukkah family, but neither myself nor my lapsed-Catholic wife are religious.Read Post | Comments (54)Arianna Huffington, 12/24/12Whatever the reason, stress is what a lot of people will be unwrapping this year.
