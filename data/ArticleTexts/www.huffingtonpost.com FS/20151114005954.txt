{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Executive Director, Issue OneIt\u0027s D-Day for American democracy. As Republican pollster Frank Luntz wrote in the New York Times after last year\u0027s elections, \"From the reddest rural towns to the bluest big cities, the sentiment is the same. People say Washington is broken and on the decline, that government no longer works for them -- only for the rich and powerful.\" Money\u0027s dominance of politics is fueling this decline more rapidly than ever; it\u0027s supplanting our hard-fought right to self governance with a system more akin to oligarchy. Yet, ask anyone what can be done to fix democracy and they often draw blanks. Many of those who do respond might say that we need to amend the Constitution to overturn Citizens United. But the truth is that there\u0027s so much that can be done, despite Citizens United.Emwazi, if he is dead, is the latest in a string of Internet jihadist celebrities targeted by the West, or others, whose notoriety, while expansive, was short-lived. It seems that being an Internet \"brand promoter\" in the contemporary terrorist world is an evanescent existence, while the brand itself is harder to extinguish.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityIn a misguided attempt to protect Hillary Clinton\u0027s coronation as the Democratic nominee, the Democratic National Committee is doing its best to ensure that as few people as possible watch the Democrat\u0027s own Presidential debates, even as tens of millions tune in to the GOP debates.Entertainment attorney, writer and political activistTens of millions of Americans do not have a bank account. As a result, many of these Americans spend a reported $89 billion annually in interest and fees by using predatory services such as payday loan and check cashing services.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorWhat this series of events does show is the chasm that sadly still exists in the experiences and therefore perspectives of most white people compared to most people of color.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersWhen my exec at Sony gave me a copy of Lynn Povich\u0027s The Good Girls Revolt last year, I knew we had to make it into a series, both to honor the generation that allowed mine to thrive and for the ones after me who know even less about past media heroines than I did.Feature Film ProducerMothers who experience depression and other forms of mental illness can\u0027t help what\u0027s happening to them, and surely they\u0027re suffering. The mentally ill often aren\u0027t capable of seeing the impact of their illness on others, so all-consuming it often is.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarAs hard as President Obama and his Administration have worked to expand opportunity and make this a more equal country, these accomplishments would not have been possible without the advocates, allies, activists and ordinary people doing extraordinary things, to change our culture every single day.Senior Advisor to the President and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsWith four of the justices in their 80s during the term of the president elected next year, these cases once again demonstrate the crucial stakes in the 2016 election for reproductive rights, as well as for so many other rights central to our liberty and freedom.Senior Fellow, People For the American Way and People For the American Way FoundationIf Hillary Clinton wants to light up the country in either the general election or the primary, she needs to take a leadership role -- not a lip service role -- in a basic, in-the-guts overhaul of how politics works in this country.CEO of MAYDAY.US, Associate Law Professor at Fordham, Corruption ScholarWhat\u0027s the second leading cause of death for California youth and young adults ages 10 to 24?

It is partly the product of the disastrous Iraq war compounded by foreseeable errors made by this administration. It is therefore up to the leadership in Washington to fulfill its responsibility.Professor of Law at the UCLA School of LawProfessor of Law, Cornell Law SchoolOur trip to Israel and Jordan had been in the works for a year. Who knew back when we planned it that we\u0027d arrive in the middle of an escalation of violent confrontations between Palestinians and Israelis that many feared would turn into a third intifada?Senior writer, BillMoyers.com. Former senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.The declining costs of technology and the rising costs of fossil fuel recovery have helped increase the space for more ambition and create the political moment in which genuine and transformative change is possible.Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate ChangeThe Boys \u0026 Girls Club has a longstanding partnership with Coca-Cola. This was a great way for the company to establish brand loyalty at an early age, in an era when no one could have imagined what a scourge soda would become.Author, Producer, AdvocateRestricting the Pentagon to its core missions, rooting out waste in the department, and using force as a tool of last resort is an approach that conservatives and liberals alike should be able to support. Rand Paul deserves credit for putting this issue on the agenda.Director, Arms and Security Project, Center for International PolicyWhen CBS News host John Dickerson and his colleagues take the stage for the Democratic presidential debate on Saturday in Des Moines, they should ask about the candidates\u0027 plans for getting big money out of politics.Executive Vice President for Policy and Program, People For the American Way \u0026 People For the American Way FoundationThese taboos and fears also make us blind to the threat of out-of-control private debt and credit wasted on real estate and speculation rather than growth that lifts everyone. For Turner, thinking radically is the most practical way forward.Author and cultural theoristYou know an industry has much to hide when it wants to criminalize documenting its everyday operations. And, if there was any question before, these recent deaths make it clearer than ever just why Iowa wanted its ag-gag law so much.Vice President of farm animal protection, The Humane Society of the United StatesHe was totally the worst during his junior varsity downward spiral the past few years, though, which despite endless incidents never reached the crisis point of Britney. Yes, Britney lost her shit but Bieber was acting like an asshole. And there\u0027s a huge difference.Senior Editor, Huffington Post CanadaAt the root of today\u0027s racial troubles on campuses, Emory University historian Leslie Harris argues, is the past, when most American universities were intimately connected to slave trade and slavery.Independent source of news and analysis, from the academic and research community.The simple fact is that we can do something about gun violence and the evidence is overwhelming. We as Americans need to turn the conversation inward and seriously weigh the consequences of our second amendment rights against the greater good.Coach, Safety Advocate, and Legal News WriterA recent Iowa jury found that the company\u0027s wage theft amounted to 5.8 million dollars for 3,000 Iowa workers over just two years. This follows decades of cases, court orders and USDOL investigations finding that the company owed millions to its workers.National Employment Law Project Action FundThe distinction between Sanders and Clinton as being between \"socialism\" and \"capitalism\" is misleading, for the real debate is about what type of capitalism the candidates favor.Professor of sociology, University of California at BerkeleyThis week Hillary Clinton again revealed a blind spot for the drug war and a deafness of tone towards Latino issues. She decided to brag about Plan Colombia, her husband\u0027s signature international drug policy initiative, which has been a total disaster in one of the most emblematic theaters of the failed war on drugs.Research Coordinator, Drug Policy AllianceWhile China was slow to show interest in Afghanistan after the overthrow of the Taliban by U.S. forces in 2001, it has changed course as part of its overall ambitious strategy in Asia and Africa.Author Sardar: From Afghanistan’s Golden Age to Carnage, Return to Kabul: An Afghan American\u0027s Odyssey in Afghanistan and Kandahar: Provincial Handbook.

Guns are a women\u0027s issue, simply put, because batterers with guns kill women in America at a rate higher than any other industrial country.Associate professor of nursing at the University of Virginia School of NursingProfessor of nursing and the Anna D. Wolf Chair at Johns Hopkins School of NursingConsumers for Smart Solar, the group promoting an anti-home-solar constitutional amendment in Florida, has collected half a million dollars from the 60 Plus Association, a group that has itself received at least $34 million since 2010 from organizations financially backed by the Koch brothers.Director of Research at The Center for Media \u0026 DemocracyIn the most recent Republican presidential primary debate, Senator Mark Rubio said: \"For the life of me, I don\u0027t know why we have stigmatized vocational education.
