{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Donald Trump has entered a new phase of autocratic weirdness. His attack on Federal Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is presiding in the lawsuit against Trump University, was a trifecta. It combined outright racism with an assault on the independent judiciary and a clear warning that Trump would use the presidency to settle personal business scores. His rants at reporters display contempt for the role of a free press. He would govern like a spiteful tyrant, with all the awesome powers of a president of the United States -- settling scores, punishing enemies, making impetuous, ignorant decisions. As this reality sinks in, Trump\u0027s campaign should be imploding about now. And it might be -- if other Republican leaders displayed a modicum of concern for the future of the Republic. But with a few notable exceptions, the GOP leadership is either giving Trump a pass, or just taking a pass.Ali spoke softly and moved deliberately, but nonetheless had an unmistakeable twinkle in his eye. In those years before his illness completely muted him, Ali had solved the issue of how to manage the outpouring of adulation that accompanied his most casual appearances by deflecting. \"No,\" he said, \"You\u0027re the greatest.\" In his face was a genuine warmth and sweetness.ActorBlackfish forced SeaWorld to announce that it would discontinue its orca-breeding program, effectively phasing out its orca captivity. That is good, but it is not enough to protect orcas at SeaWorld in the future, or orcas that are or might later be held in other locations.Actress and activistThe talk on corporately owned mainstream media (MSM) is of a historic moment on Tuesday, when, if you count Hillary\u0027s 400 plus superdelegates, her total number can go above the needed 2383, and, the talk goes, she becomes the Democrats\u0027 presumptive nominee -- the first woman to win a nomination for president. Yes, this would be something to celebrate. If true.Troubadour, AuthorI was blessed to have been on several continents with him, and whether it was the Caribbean, Africa, the United States or elsewhere, he loved people -- and they loved him. He would be running into crowds, signing autographs, kissing babies, giving hugs and taking pictures.President, National Action NetworkIf Hillary Clinton, as the likely Democratic nominee, hopes to capture a sizable majority of the male vote?--?overcoming low favorability ratings among men?--?and set herself apart from this destructive group, she needs to activate the still-ignored majority of men.Chairman \u0026 Media Ecologist, MyersBizNetThe weak employment report for May should eliminate any possibility that the Federal Reserve Board will raise interest rates at its June meeting next week. At least for this purpose, the bad news is good news. But we should still be asking why the Fed has its finger on the trigger in the first place.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Most environmentalists I know are now more optimistic than ever that as a planet we are finally on the road to addressing this crisis. But action, collaboration, and leadership in the White House will make us or break us in the next four years.Author, Producer, AdvocateI\u0027ve been writing for years about the threat of insurrectionism in this country. Now I\u0027m watching my fears come to fruition in this current political climate, where violence is increasingly becoming an acceptable response to court rulings, or political disagreements.Executive Director, Coalition to Stop Gun ViolenceWe tend to forget that everyday the president of the United States controls the most awesome power ever invested in a single human being in the history of humanity: the power to launch a nuclear attack that could conceivably destroy much of humanity.Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersMy grandfather once said himself, \"The Post is my best and only opportunity to express myself fully.\" He liked to come up with his own stories and tell them his way -- and the Post covers were the best way for him to do that.Jazz singer/songwriter; granddaughter of Norman RockwellEverybody in America but the Trumpeters is doing better, and their justified fear is turning to rage -- rage aimed mostly at anything and anyone that doesn\u0027t seem like a real hairy male.Paris writer and former NPR correspondentIf President Obama continues to speak forcefully for the expansion of Social Security, as he did this week, he will leave office with a legacy that historians of Social Security will recognize as important and lasting.Founding Co-director, Social Security WorksHena Khan, 42, an American Muslim author, thinks children\u0027s books and religious literacy might be a partial answer to increased Islamophobia.When I recently read about an Alabama teacher giving her eighth grade class a \"racist math test,\" I had to laugh. This couldn\u0027t be for real. Do 13-year-olds even know how to quantify an eight-ball of cocaine? Perhaps this teacher was trying to \"break bad\" and was looking for the Jesse Pinkman to her Walter White. When I realized it wasn\u0027t a joke -- these kids actually had to complete and turn in this test -- my feelings morphed into anger. I wasn\u0027t mad at this one teacher, but at a world where we are constantly confronted by stories of hate.Blog Editor, Huffington Post CanadaTrump wants to run the government but doesn\u0027t feel he\u0027s accountable for paying the taxes necessary to run the government or, for example, to cover the cost of federal benefits for those veterans he claims he loves so much.International President, United SteelworkersWe loved our daughter and were proud of her. A murderer took her life in a theater -- a place where anyone should feel safe. Those are the facts. The corporate gun lobby trolls should be ashamed of themselves for blowing smoke instead of putting out the fire.Parents of Aurora victim Jessica Ghawi2. Don\u0027t be tied to your history: As Ed relayed, \"You have way more ahead of you than behind you... bringing the dead weight of your legacy from your past into the future can be detrimental to the business.\" Just because Kodak was in the paper-and-chemicals business doesn\u0027t mean they can\u0027t be something else.Chairman/CEO, XPRIZEIt’s critical that we now focus on the important steps that build on existing momentum and embrace new technologies and approaches that lay the groundwork for a clean energy future.President and CEO, SunPowerI decided to tell my family at the meal that breaks the Ramadan fast what I had been hiding for 20 years; that their son Hamza was really their daughter Mala.Transgender activist in MoroccoOur increasingly myopic foreign policy of countering terrorism puts our nation in a precarious position and must be reevaluated. Secretary Clinton rightly pointed out that \"we are not a nation that cowers behind walls.\"Senior Policy \u0026 Development ConsultantOver and over we hear from the sidelines of marches in which fires, tear gas and warning shots have replaced the chants and slogans of the workers of yesteryear, Martinez\u0027s defiant words about \"police brutality,\" about \"employers\u0027 violence,\" and about his own intent to alter, unassisted, and like one of the greats, the \"balance of power\" between the CGT and a treacherous left that supposedly has turned betrayal into a tool of government and of survival.French philosopher and writerHillary is the only candidate who has consistently stood on the side of gun safety. She\u0027s the only candidate has stood with gun violence survivors. And she\u0027s the only candidate who has shown the backbone to stand up to the gun lobby\u0027s extreme \"guns everywhere\" agenda.Founder, Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in AmericaLet\u0027s be clear: The institution of slavery took thousands, if not millions, of Black lives. The institution of slavery is never to be lauded or celebrated. But the people who were enslaved? These people are nothing to be ashamed of.Writer. Learner. Learner. Learner.Unfortunately, the U.S. government has no ability to protect North Koreans from their own government. Bomb Pyongyang? Tighten sanctions? Push Beijing to end support for North Korea? If such steps don\u0027t work for nukes, they won\u0027t work for human rights.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteRegardless of the electoral math, Bernie\u0027s candidacy has never been mainly about Bernie. It\u0027s been about a movement to reclaim our democracy and economy from the moneyed interests.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027If Hillary wins, it will be said that now she moves toward the convention with the wind at her back. If Bernie wins, it will be said that Hillary is limping toward the convention in a weakened condition. Because the media say it matters whether it is 51-49 or 49-51, it will matter. But really, why should it?Award-winning author of What We\u0027re Up Against, former Democratic nominee for Congress in Virginia, political commentator and talk radio philosopherMuhammad Ali defined my assimilation as an American and growth as global citizen. He was so different that we might have expected him to go to the grave screaming of his greatness. However, we all saw a piece of ourselves in him, and his greatest character strength was that he saw in everyone he met a connection to the higher.Former Bosnian foreign minister and ambassador to the United NationsThe first time I heard \u0027Hey, Buzzard!\u0027 I was 12, and I knew he was talking to me. With a small crowd around him, Walter began flapping his arms wildly in the air, and making loud \u0027caw, caw, caw\u0027 sounds. His friends were already laughing and didn\u0027t need an explanation.Memoirist, humorist, bloggerThere were some wild and unfounded speculations that Saudi Arabia is investing in Uber to maintain its ban on women driving. Others ridiculed Uber for seeking business, leave alone investment funds, in a country that bans women from driving.Editor-in-Chief, Al Arabiya English; author of upcoming book on Arab mediaHillary Clinton\u0027s recent foreign policy speech was an attack on Donald Trump but was also a reminder that Clinton is a deeply flawed and worrisome candidate.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia UniversityGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
