{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundIn 2010, 19,392 Americans, including 749 children and teenagers, killed themselves with a gun. Boys were eight times more likely than girls to die in a gun suicide. A little over one in four (28 percent) gun deaths in children and teens were suicides and 66 percent were homicides. For adults 20 and older, it was almost the reverse. Two out of three deaths (65 percent) were suicides and 32 percent were homicides. Almost 88 percent of the victims of gun suicides of all ages were White, but for children and teens, American Indian or Alaska Native children and teens had the highest rate of gun suicide, nearly twice as high as White children and teens. Gun suicides have contributed to a terrible overall trend: Suicide has now overtaken car accidents as the leading cause of injury-related deaths for the total population in the United States.Comments (472)Thu-Huong HaEditorial projects editor, TEDA total stranger helped Hyeonseo Lee pay her mother and brother\u0027s way out of jail as they fled from North Korea.

Dean of International Business \u0026 Finance, The Fletcher School at Tufts University, Founding Exec. Director, Institute for Business in the Global ContextMs. Lee speaks the universal truths of the immigrant experience: a dream, of place not one\u0027s own; a journey, quite distinct from travel of any other kind; and what, V.S. Naipaul has so eloquently described as the \"enigma of arrival.\"CommentsTyler McKayCarpenter, Musician, WriterI\u0027m recently engaged. I blew all of my rent money, hid the little shiny in my back pocket, and proposed successfully the last night of 2012.

I understand it\u0027s a victory, a battle won while the war rages. And that\u0027s what I\u0027m most angry at: the way we are fighting the war.Comments (120)Dan TreadwayAssociate blog editor, The Huffington PostWhat Rick Perry doesn\u0027t understand is that in attempting to win the battle for SB 5, he\u0027s starting what will be a war for Texas -- and demographics indicate that his side doesn\u0027t have the numbers in the long term.Comments (116)Ardis D.
