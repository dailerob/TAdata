They pledged to spend millions of dollars on TV ads. They threatened to fill town hall meetings with angry, sign-waving constituents. Their intent was to build a veto-proof majority in the House and Senate to scuttle this plan, which is one of the Obama administration\u0027s signature foreign policy achievements -- reason enough for opposition for many Republican lawmakers. It didn\u0027t happen, and now it\u0027s time to be peacemakers.The labor force remained flat in August, meaning the participation rate is still stuck at a low 62.6%, more than three points off of its peak prior to the downturn. Some of that decline can be assigned to retiring boomers, but some remains due to persistently weak demand.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorEuropeans are facing an extraordinary challenge that inevitably elicits humanitarian, moral and ethical soul-searching, but also poses real political and security questions. I can only sympathize with them as they wrestle with this complex challenge.Former President, East Timor, 1996 Nobel Peace Prize laureateTo many, the true meaning of Labor Day has been lost?it\u0027s merely a three-day vacation weekend. Labor Day is the time to push for long-overdue action. It\u0027s a moment for the nation to shine a light upon the rights and plights of workers and recognize the need to strengthen labor laws.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorIn 2013, a U.S. Senate committee exposed the fact that too many federal contractors are violating federal wage laws and health and safety standards, yet continue to profit off of U.S. taxpayers with repeat contracts.The Center for Media and Democracy/ALEC ExposedThe first time I met a refugee was the day I was born. She was my mother. My parents were fleeing the Iranian regime. They had already been on the run for three years inside of Iran, changing places every two months. They were political activists and both had been sentenced to death.Journalist in SwedenOne could hardly blame liberal Jews for wanting to celebrate AIPAC\u0027s defeat or for some Israeli\u0027s to lament what they called \"Netanyahu\u0027s strategic blunder\". Both views, however, are naïve and shortsighted. On several levels, Netanyahu won.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027My dream, as unconventional as it is, is becoming a reality.

If Republicans can have twelve debates, why must Democrats be mired in only six?Columnist published in The Cleveland Plain Dealer, The Baltimore Sun, The Hill, Salon, The Jerusalem Post www.hagoodman.comWe must wake up, open our eyes and ears, avoid convenient ignorance, seek the truth, speak up, stand up, and never give up fighting for justice for all. How long?President, Children\u0027s Defense FundLast week, President Obama made the most extensive presidential visit to Alaska ever.

Throughout, he was calling attention to the real, on-the-ground effects of climate change.Executive Director, The Sierra ClubI was working at a law firm in New York City, achieving professional success but feeling that something was missing. What was I contributing? Was I reaching my full potential?U.S. Senator from New YorkThis isn\u0027t just about garbage; it\u0027s about everything. For many years, people complained about the country. But aimlessly and without hope for any meaningful change. I believe they\u0027ve come to the realization that democracy isn\u0027t a spectator sport.Writer and musician based in Beirut, Lebanon.

Next week, pumpkin lattes and apple spice muffins will be everywhere, so make your weekend extra sweet with these delicious summery treats.Chef, Recipe Developer and Busy MomPresident Obama had some fun this week, and by doing so actually forced the media to tackle a serious subject on his agenda.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comWe can afford to pay workers fairly and it is the right thing to do. We also need equal pay for equal work. Today, women, on average, still earn only 78 cents for every dollar earned by men. It is even less for women of color -- for African-American women it\u0027s 64 cents and for Latinas it\u0027s 55 cents. This is unacceptable.U.S. Representative for Illinois\u0027s 9th congressional districtTurkey\u0027s offering Washington a fig leaf of cooperation against the Islamic State, but it\u0027s turning all its firepower against the most effective anti-ISIS fighters in the region -- the Kurds.Foreign Policy In Focus (FPIF) columnistObviously, Judge Richard Berman is not a die-hard New York football fan or if he is, he was able to put that bias aside. Even if you despise Tom Brady, the overturning of his suspension was the right legal decision.Television Correspondent and AttorneyEngineers, historically, have always responded to crises. Be it the time of a natural calamity or the time of violent conflict, engineers have always been at the leading edge, to defend the most precious of all assets: the human life.Professor of Biomedical EngineeringSometimes the notes were wonderful, gossipy accounts of family life, reminding us that the ordinary and mundane is as beautiful and important as the dramatic and spectacular. And sometimes they were thoughtful, almost meditative reflections on our situation and how it had inspired them to act. I even got poetry.JournalistDialogue is exactly what Argentina is asking for to solve the \"Question of the Malvinas Islands,\" a 182-year old sovereignty dispute with the United Kingdom over the Malvinas, South Georgias and South Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime areas.Ambassador of Argentina to the United States of AmericaThere have been many articles written about his accomplishments and a recently published biography \"And Give Up Showbiz?\" by Josh Young but without sticking to the observations of others... I hoped to find more about Mr. Levin with my own set of questions.Fashion MarketingMy excitement and anticipation to finally see the conversation on television turned into me feeling hurt and further silenced by the end of the episode. My story -- and the story of TransTech -- had been truncated down to the fact that I had once been involved with sex work.Founding CEO of TransTech Social Enterprises and Miss Ross, Inc. Visit MissRoss.com and TransTechSocial.orgKim Davis has already become a symbol for what is euphemistically called \"Freedom of Religion,\" which unfortunately in recent times has just become code for anti-LGBT bigotry.

At work, as I ran errands, and as I fell asleep at night, this one absolutely crucial question bounced endlessly around inside my head: Do I put my yoga mat at the front of the class, or at the back of the class?Author, Talk Show Host, Sexpert, Metaphysician, Motivational Speaker, Holistic Practitioner, Ordained ReverendAmerica has an epidemic of youth violence that must be addressed.

Nonprofit Leader, Sports-Based Youth Development Expert, Writer and Advocate for Youth DevelopmentDavis and her supporters, whether out of ignorance or willfulness, have completely distorted the Constitution.

While it would be foolish to offer any simple solution, I do think that there are some attitudes that we should have.Christian Author and SpeakerIt is time to take Donald Trump very seriously indeed. When we do, the results can be alarming. For Donald Trump is not only a serious candidate. He is also a dangerous one, in a series of linked and disturbing ways.Worrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsWould that President Obama meant what he said when, as he began his symbolic, climate-change-awareness trek to Alaska, he declared: \"The time to plead ignorance is surely past.\"Syndicated writer\"What Do You Mean,\" like \"Blurred Lines,\" points to a consensual ambiguity where a woman\u0027s partner takes interpretation into his own hands by presuming (incorrectly) to know what she\u0027s thinking -- even when she says otherwise.Writer, dancer, and foodieGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
