{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jason LinkinsEditor, Eat the PressAccording to a long string of ones and zeroes that were translated and illuminated inside this glowing box that I like to call \"the Internet,\" sometime former Alaska governor and vice presidential aspirant Sarah Palin is \"considering\" a run for the Senate. Specifically, Palin said, \"I’ve considered it because people have requested me considering it.\" Which makes sense. It\u0027s sort of like that thing where I tell you, \"Don\u0027t think of a sharknado,\" and then all you can do is think of a sharknado. But while lots of people, in that position, will go on to think of a sharknado, only a few will actually commit themselves to the effort of making a movie about a sharknado. The question is: Will Sarah Palin sharknado Alaska\u0027s Senate seat in 2014?Comments (120)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Suppose a small group of extremely wealthy people sought to systematically destroy the U.S. government.
