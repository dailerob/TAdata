{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor, USC Marshall School, and author of \u0027The Secret Handshake\u0027 and \u0027Childhood Denied\u0027Given Obama\u0027s hemming and hawing about appointing Warren, it\u0027s not far-fetched to think that history could repeat itself. Another woman trying to break the old guard\u0027s economic chokehold could be shown the door. If the financial overseers do pull a \"Brooksley Born\" on Warren, they will be overestimating their power and underestimating both the acumen and the power of Americans who supported President Obama in the past. They will also be turning their backs on those striving to join the middle class and those struggling to remain there.Read Post | CommentsJason Linkins, 09.13.2010While America was preparing to burn Qurans for 9/11 Day, NPR went out and found the missing oil.

Hard to argue with that, but watch the GOP try.Read Post | CommentsRabbi Shmuley Boteach, 09.13.2010Rabbi and writerHow did an attention-seeking nonentity with barely enough Church followers to fill a phone booth become an international personality and provoke a global furor?
