Dianne Feinstein, 07.01.2010U.S. Senator from California.At a time of great hardship for many Americans, it is unconscionable that a few mega-corporations can simply misplace a few decimal points and quickly rack up millions of dollars in unjust profits.Read Post | CommentsAlan Kraut, 07.01.2010Professor of History, American UniversityIn 1860, Lincoln ran on a platform that was \"in favor of giving a full and efficient protection to the rights of all classes of citizens, whether native or naturalized, both at home and abroad.\"Read Post | CommentsBob Cesca, 06.30.2010Author, Blogger, New Media ProducerThe Republicans are willing to let one out of every ten of your friends go broke in the name of foiling the president and reclaiming control over the government (which they say they hate). Think about that.Read Post | CommentsTimothy Karr, 07.01.2010Campaign Director, Free Press and SavetheInternet.comMedia giants are spending a fortune to convince lawmakers and regulators to dismantle consumer protections on the Internet and give industry absolute power over the most important communications medium of our time.Read Post | CommentsZach Carter, 07.01.2010Economics Editor, AlterNet; Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureGoldman Sachs sent its second-highest-ranking officer to to tell the FCIC that his company is staffed by complete idiots.
