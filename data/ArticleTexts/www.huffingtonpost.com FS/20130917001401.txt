{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonI\u0027m delighted to announce that HuffPost is joining forces with the e-commerce site Shopify as part of their Build-A-Business competition. Build-A-Business harnesses the power of the entrepreneurial spirit in a way that can launch new businesses and improve the consumer experience at the same time. Its focus on mentorship emphasizes the importance of building relationships and tapping into the wisdom and experience of others. Last year, more than 10,000 participants racked up more than $55 million in total sales during the 8 months of the competition. And in addition to helping businesses get off the ground, Build-A-Business is doing an additional service: providing a glimpse into the creative process and the ways ideas can grow into viable businesses. In other words, it\u0027s not just about building, it\u0027s about telling the stories of the hard work, creativity and collaboration that fuel innovation.Comments (12)Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027It would have been much more difficult for opposition within the Democratic Party to fester if Obama had simply announced his Fed choice.Comments (117)Stefanie Chiras, PhDManager, System \u0026 Technology Group Design Center, IBMWhen I was growing up in Massachusetts, my Dad loved to work on cars. Every time he headed out to the driveway, I was right there with him. One weekend, when I was 10 or so, he told me we were off to fix a transmission. \"I can\u0027t do that,\" I said. He replied without a pause, \"People do it every day. You can certainly do it once.\" That straightforward advice -- and the fact that we did fix the transmission -- stuck with me.CommentsRobert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027One of the most deceptive ideas continuously sounded by the Right is that the \"free market\" is natural and inevitable, existing outside and beyond government. So whatever inequality or insecurity it generates is beyond our control.Comments (388)Joanna MontgomeryWife, mother, survivor, BRCA1 positiveThose of us who either opted to have mastectomies as a preventative measure, or had mastectomies as a life-saving measure, aren\u0027t excited about our \"new boobs.\" In truth, we\u0027ll never be the same. We see ourselves differently now when we look in the mirror, because we are different, inside as well as outside.Comments (117)Maureen RyanTV critic, The Huffington PostEvery time you thought things couldn\u0027t get worse, they did. Every time you thought the lowest point had been reached, it hadn\u0027t been. There was more. It kept coming.Comments (1,533)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkDid we need to save the private sector? Absolutely. But we\u0027re nowhere near done saving families who are still suffering from the effects of the financial crisis that they didn\u0027t create.Comments (17)Bianca JaggerFounder and Chair, Bianca Jagger Human Rights FoundationDavid Cameron has some important questions to answer. Why has he changed his policy, which in 2012 was still directed towards a coming-of-age for renewable energy in the UK? Who counselled Mr Cameron to abandon renewable energy for fracking?Comments (15)Jessica Ciencin HenriquezFreelance Writer and Author of the upcoming novel, Lies I\u0027ve Told My Therapist.The only thing pregnant woman hate more than forced temporary sobriety is forced small talk with strangers but it seems that as long as there are pregnancies, there will be strangers demanding to know all about them.Comments (174)Marty KaplanDirector, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg Schoolsay goodnight to the dream that education, journalism, scientific evidence, media literacy or reason can provide the tools and information that people need in order to make good decisions. It turns out that in the public realm, a lack of information isn\u0027t the real problem.Comments (55)Robert RedfordActor, director and environmental activistTar sands oil is exactly the type of dirty oil we can no longer afford. It may be great for oil companies, but it is killing our planet. There is no energy security in that.Comments (261)Rebecca SolnitAuthor, \u0027A Paradise Built in Hell\u0027On the second anniversary of that day in lower Manhattan when people first sat down in outrage and then stayed in dedication and solidarity and hope, remember them, remember how unpredictably the world changes, remember to hope, remember to build.Comments (13)Tom Frieden, MD, MPHDirector, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)Without urgent and aggressive action, more patients will be thrust back to a time when simple infections can be deadly. And, the loss of effective antibiotics will undermine treatment of infectious complications in patients with other diseases.CommentsBill MoyersManaging Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyLet us now praise common sense. Once again a president was about to plunge us into the darkest waters of foreign policy where the ruling principle becomes: \"When in doubt, bomb someone.\"Comments (54)Jamie WhiteBlogger, dog loverHow do I know who you are? Because the people at Animal Control gave me Cocoa\u0027s intake sheet. You know, the one you filled out. The one that said Cocoa was 12 years old and you\u0027d had her all those years. I just couldn\u0027t understand why someone would dump a family member.Comments (596)Ryan BanfillPartner and Senior Vice President, Sachs Media GroupWhen I was in high school, a fellow teenager asked me, \"Why do you speak all proper and s*%t?\" I have watched people stare at me as they tried to get to the courage to ask me, \"What are you?\" Incidentally, it\u0027s that same question my children get asked even today.CommentsMike Hogan and Christopher RosenCounting them up, we have no fewer than 16 possible nominees. So instead of our usual back-and-forth, I thought it might be fun to lay down racetrack odds on each actors\u0027 chances of making it to the Final Five. Let the games begin?Comments (16)Thomas McKennaEditorial Fellow at The Huffington PostWhat\u0027s interesting about the life and times of Johnny Football is how thoroughly he upends every cliche that is heretofore accepted when it comes to the relationship a football quarterback is supposed to have between his persona and performance.CommentsWait But Whywww.waitbutwhy.comLucy is part of Generation Y, the generation born between the late 1970s and the mid 1990s. She\u0027s a unique brand of yuppie, one who thinks they are the main character of a very special story. Only issue is this one thing: Lucy\u0027s kind of unhappy.Comments (1,636)Dan TreadwayAssociate blog editor, The Huffington PostMany of us, and this is a trap I often fall into, are desperate to put ignorant comments on blast in order to feel a sort of moral superiority. Doing so never actually makes us feel better, but rather just fills us with an anger that we secretly probably love because it reaffirms our own beliefs.Comments (24)Mike WeisserMike the Gun GuyThe biggest problem in dealing with the issue of gun violence is that the two sides don\u0027t have the foggiest idea of what the other side is talking about. Want the latest example? It comes from the gun control side.Comments (212)Philip RadfordExecutive Director, GreenpeaceThe fossil fuel industry desperately wants to get us hooked to its latest product before we have time to adequately study it.CommentsDr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarThe billion dollar wedding industry sells engagement as a time of sweep trains, fondants, and last hurrahs in Vegas. But engagement is just as likely to be remembered for stress-induced meltdowns, battles over money and control, and family dynamics gone horribly wrong.Comments (12)Oliver TearleAuthor; Lecturer in English, Loughborough Univ.Sherlock Holmes never says \u0027Elementary, my dear Watson.\u0027 Not in the canon of original Conan Doyle novels and stories. Holmes says \u0027Elementary!\u0027 and \u0027my dear Watson\u0027 at various points, but the idea of putting them together was a later meme.Comments (14)Matt FrazierVegan marathoner; Author, \u0027No Meat Athlete\u0027Though we focus on the differences in our diets, and fight like pissed-off hornets as a result, the healthy versions of both Paleo and vegan diets look an awful lot alike.Comments (45)Jamie BruesehoffBlogger, \u0027I Am Totally *That* Mom\u0027I know it\u0027s hard, but thank you for what you do when you bring your children to church. Please know that your family -- with all of its noise, struggle, commotion, and joy -- are not simply tolerated, you are a vital part of the community gathered in worship.Comments (1,772)Horacio FabianoSocial Media and Projects Editor, The Huffington PostOver 100 displays, meticulously arranged and organized by different historical periods, provide a retrospective view of the fashion contributions of LGBTQ individuals over the past 300 years. I pretended I was accompanied by my beloved Oscar Wilde wearing a bright velvet cape.CommentsDr. James HansenClimatologistThe New Yorker\u0027s statement that \"climate change could become uncontainable,\" unfortunately, is not science fiction. If we are so foolish as to burn all fossil fuels, including all coal and unconventional fuels, that result is nearly certain.Comments (148)Nathan GardelsEditor, NPQ, Global Services of Los Angeles Times Syndicate/Tribune MediaMohamed El-Erian is the CEO of the investment firm PIMCO, the world\u0027s largest bond investor.
