{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, we found out that the State of the Union -- or at least the rhetoric about it -- is strong. To no one\u0027s surprise, President Obama delivered another good speech. Highlights included his call for an increase in the minimum wage, the announcement of steps towards fixing our broken voting system, and a promise to step up on climate change. The president also vowed that \"by the end of next year, our war in Afghanistan will be over\" -- though he didn\u0027t explain why we need to wait until then. The speech\u0027s most powerful moment was Obama\u0027s passionate call for gun control. His overarching message was: I welcome bipartisanship, but if I don\u0027t get it, I\u0027ll do it myself. As the shameful GOP filibuster of Chuck Hagel showed, the odds are the president will be spending his second term in DIY mode.Read Post | Comments (97)Garry Wills, 02/12/13Author, \u0027Why Priests?: A Failed Tradition\u0027We live in a time when Catholic priests are an aging and shrinking group, damaged in morale and reputation, overstretched in their monopolization of all sacramental services.
