{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"I\u0027m that homecoming queen who played DnDIt\u0027s pretty basic. Belief in the supremacy of civilian control over the armed forces is the cornerstone of American democracy. The institutional failure evident in Ferguson, MO is a sign of civilian dereliction. For an issue so important, Congress and the Executive Branch must initiate a process to modernize or scrap Posse Comitatus. The military itself knows that force is often counter-productive. The civilians need to step up. If we keep going down this path, the trade-offs will fundamentally change our democracy. We\u0027ve come up against this problem in the past and we got through it okay. We can do it again.The shooting death of Michael Brown and the death of countless and nameless others, remind me of my days growing up in the Arkansas delta in the 1950s and 1960s, and the warnings from my mother about not giving \"the law\" a reason to arrest or worse yet, shoot us.Higher Education Expert and ConsultantWhen she was 15 years old, Malala Yousafzai dared to speak out against the Taliban. Her father offers a window into a world where girls aren\u0027t allowed to leave the house, let alone speak their minds -- and he makes a plea for change.\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"Police in general get a bad rap, and the vast majority are good, loyal souls. But their training and the institutional mentality they come from often leads to a warped perspective of how they function within communities that they do not live in.Founder, GlobalGrind.comAllow me to try on clothes in peace. Don\u0027t get me wrong. You can be attentive, but knocking on the dressing room door as if you\u0027re sending morse code to an American ally in the Ukraine is not meant to be helpful; it\u0027s meant to make your presence known and me nervous.Stand Up Comic \u0026 Creator of Blaria Blog (http://blaria.com)Regardless of what you think about Obama, the impeachment discussion, such as it is, has further underscored that the Republicans are not ready to govern, and in fact may not even be interested in doing that.lincolnmitchell.comWe will be able to stop Ebola in the coming weeks and months. But that is not the end of the story. Will we also build a strong enough health system to stop the next outbreak? We believe that it is a moral and economic imperative to do so, and all of us must work toward that goal.President, World Bank GroupChairperson of the African UnionIs advising women going off to college -- or out dancing, for that matter -- to be as safe as they can be given what we know about our dangerous world, filled with dangerous people, a way of condoning victim-blaming?

Yes, you most likely will become a victim.Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911Unlike the victims of the Gaza conflict, whose charred bodies fill the feeds of social media in Western countries, these dead are part of a war you don\u0027t see.Novelist, Arts \u0026 Humanities Research CouncilWe know the commonly repeated claim that there are more Black men in prison than in college isn\u0027t true--but in 2011 Black men accounted for fewer than 6 percent of undergraduate students and 4 percent of graduate students, though they made up 8.7 percent of 18-29 year olds.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe \"What will your verse be?\" scene was the first time school seemed relevant to life in general.Executive Editor of HuffPost Impact, HuffPost Good NewsOnce again, I wonder why it requires death to grapple with our legacy of racism and the continuation of institutionalized racism that criminalizes black and brown bodies. When can we accept the pattern before us and move forward to change it?Attorney, BloggerForget about the biology of it for second (that was mom\u0027s job), my dad never let on that he thought there was a difference in when I could speak, how I could learn, what choices I should have or what I should be allowed to achieve and contribute with my life. My dad never questioned that I would grow up to be his equal, to be the equal of my brothers. To my dad, my value as an equal to boys and men was a basic truth.Director, Policy and Advocacy - A World at School; Director, Policy and Research - Global Business Coalition for EducationThe killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, on Saturday night and the subsequent outcry over police tactics carried out by a force often indistinguishable from an occupying army have brought heightened scrutiny to the militarization of American policing.Director of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel HillAs we celebrate our collective love of sharks, we should also take a moment to reflect on the many threats that sharks face. Sharks are in trouble -- and while we\u0027ve made a lot of progress protecting them, we still need your help.ActressCEO, OceanaAs a white person in the U.S., I am conditioned from birth to see whiteness as safety -- white neighborhoods, white people, white authority figures. My lived experience, my conversations with people of color, and my study of history have shown me over and over that this is a wild and cruel perversion of the truth.Senior Minister, Church of the Larger FellowshipThe Giver makes the knowledge of history a precondition for freedom. In a very American tradition, it valorizes memory and passion above serenity and predictability.Director of undergraduate film studies, Columbia University; Moderator \"Reel Pieces,\" 92Y; and author of PHILIP KAUFMANOver the past five days in Ferguson, Missouri, after the tragic killing of unarmed teenager Mike Brown, the police and local government have shown a lack of understanding of the First Amendment\u0027s protection. Your job is to PROTECT those who have grievances with our government.Editor-In-Chief of GlobalGrind.comWelcome to a new era of American policing, where cops increasingly see themselves as soldiers occupying enemy territory, often with the help of Uncle Sam’s armory, and where even nonviolent crimes are met with overwhelming force and brutality.Journalist/WriterIndividual police officers and departments should be held accountable for their mistakes. But the implications of what we\u0027ve done can\u0027t be worked through in the context of an individual tragedy.Senior Fellow, DemosRepublicans should explain poverty using more words than \"single mother\" and \"culture.\" The unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, a town with 75 percent African-American citizens and double the poverty rate of Missouri, is a testament to the economic segregation faced by black citizens.Author and Journalist published in Salon.com, the Jerusalem Post, Chicago Tribune, The Hill\u0027s Congress Blog, and other publications. www.hagoodman.comLet\u0027s approach the remaining 500 days fully aware of how our hard work can add up to millions of precious lives, and bring our ambitious goals closer than ever to the finish line.UN Special Envoy for Health FinancingTolstoy is actually a pretty appropriate author for twentysomethings to be reading in our current society.
