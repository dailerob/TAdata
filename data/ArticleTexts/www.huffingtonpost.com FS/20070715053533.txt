Is the same dynamic driving the president on Iraq? Are the efforts of administration pragmatists like Robert Gates and Condi Rice to shift the White House on the war being thwarted by 43\u0027s reluctance to face the wrath of his venomous veep? There\u0027s a scary thought: Americans continue to die in Iraq not because Bush is worried withdrawal would embolden al-Qaeda over there but because it would infuriate al-Cheney here at home.TiVo Alert: On Sunday morning I\u0027ll be on CNN\u0027s Reliable Sources at 10am ET and on The McLaughlin Group on NBC at 10:30am ET.Read Post | CommentsBIOChris Kelly, 07.10.2007Real patriots -- like the thin yellow line of heroes at the National Review Online -- have just about had it with the \"mothers\" of the \"soldiers\" in actual \"combat.\"Read Post | Comments (204)BIOMarty Kaplan, 07.11.2007In Bush\u0027s faith-based epistemology, the strongest possible justification for any action he takes is that he believes in it.
