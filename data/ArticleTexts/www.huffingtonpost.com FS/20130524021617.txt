{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Mark GongloffChief financial writer, The Huffington PostApple CEO Tim Cook waved a magic wand in front of America on Tuesday, vanishing our outrage over how shamelessly companies avoid paying taxes, leaving the rest of us to foot the bill. As a public service to you, here is a chart that should enrage you about corporate tax rates all over again! What this shows is how dramatically corporate tax contributions have shrunk in the past several decades, and how our personal taxes have risen to fill the gap. Payroll taxes now make up 35 percent of all federal government tax receipts, up from 11 percent in 1950. Corporate income taxes, meanwhile, now make up less than 10 percent of federal revenue, down from about 26 percent in 1950. To \u0027splain those numbers a little more clearly: We who are on the payrolls of companies now bear way more of a tax burden than those companies bore decades ago. Those companies, meanwhile, bear less of a burden than we ever did.Comments (6,308)Edward Steers Jr.AuthorNapoleon Bonaparte once famously observed \"history is a set of lies agreed upon.\" For those who look for the truth, it is often far too easy to believe in fraudulent history and science when they tell us what we want to hear.Comments (305)Joanne HarrisAuthor, ChocolatYou see, there are things they never tell you when you become a parent. One is that, from the day you give birth, some part of you will be afraid -- always and forever. The other is that, someday, the child you love will love someone else even more than they love you.Comments (65)Mike HoganExecutive Arts and Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post Media GroupI\u0027m curious to see how this all looks in 3D, and I\u0027m curious to know what a paying audience will think. But for now, at least, the dark rumors that World War Z would be dead-on-arrival appear to have been greatly exaggerated.Comments (54)John Dramani MahamaPresident, GhanaThe goal of Universal Access to prevention, treatment care and support and to ensuring zero transmission of HIV in children may appear to be a daunting task. But it is achievable. The driving force for realization of this goal is the mobilization of resources for implementation.CommentsAlison SpiegelAssociate Blog Editor, The Huffington PostEven if you\u0027re short on time, don\u0027t skip these six steps. They can make all the difference.CommentsPaul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostI sat down to talk with Anne Heche about her new comedy, Save Me -- what looks to be a very funny, brave and timely series that puts God on primetime in a way that we have never seen him/her before.CommentsMehdi HasanPolitical director of The Huffington Post UKWhen Anders Breivik, self-styled member of an \u0027international Christian military order\u0027, massacred 77 innocent Norwegians, most them children, in July 2011, did we indict Christianity? Sadly, we hold Islam and Muslims to a separate standard...Comments (68)Trita ParsiPresident, National Iranian American CouncilWhile a very slight glimmer of hope existed after the fraudulent elections in 2009 that the negative trajectory could be reversed through the ballot box, even that small probability may now have been eliminated.Comments (193)Eva MoonPerformance artist, writerWho is the real you? The happy, focused, vital woman who made the drastic choice to \"mutilate herself\" and then move on? Or the physically intact, \"natural\" woman who lives in dread of the next round of surveillance?Comments (75)Tom EngelhardtEditor, TomDispatch.comTo destroy our planet with malice aforethought, with only the most immediate profits on the brain, with only your own comfort and wellbeing (and those of your shareholders) in mind: Isn\u0027t that the ultimate crime?Comments (47)Robert L. BorosagePresident, Institute for America\u0027s FutureWe are sitting idly, watching, and suffering, as our nation disintegrates into a run-down backwater. At the same time, over 20 million people are in need of full-time work. Yet instead of grabbing this opportunity to rebuild the country, Washington is focused on cutting budgets.Comments (39)Jordan SchultzThe Huffington Post\u0027s sports columnist, The Schultz Report\"I would say we\u0027ll probably have him in next time,\" Vogel said after the Pacers\u0027 103-102 defeat. Paul George added: \"[Hibbert] does an amazing job of protecting the rim. I\u0027m 100 percent sure he would\u0027ve been there.\"CommentsCarl PopeFormer executive director and chairman, Sierra ClubWhat is mystifying is why almost all of America\u0027s political class is willing to support a set of policy decisions whose outcomes will be to impoverish most Americans and weaken the nation.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorTechnology and tax law have led to the emergence of what international tax analyst Ed Kleinbard calls \"stateless income,\" a phenomenon that was on full display at the Apple hearing yesterday.Comments (44)Amitai EtzioniProfessor of international relations, George Washington UniversityThe president is either moping or muttering defensively about the abuses by the IRS and the tragedy of Benghazi. As I see it, if he wakes up tomorrow and is willing to speak up, there are a few things he could fairly state. First, any suggestion that \"the IRS\" went after the Tea Party are bogus.Comments (429)Murray LippSocial justice activistAlthough the increasing visibility of LGBT people and gains in equality may be associated with short-term rises in homophobic violence, these changes are merely triggers. We must move beyond superficial and individualistic analyses of such heinous events and target their root causes.Comments (15)Leilani MünterRace car driver, environmental activistFree market economics is touted by conservatives, and yet almost routinely now we are seeing legislation being introduced designed solely to block the competition that Tesla is bringing to the old guard.Comments (70)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; host, \u0027The Breakdown\u0027; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureApple\u0027s $100 billion in offshore profits is managed in Reno, tracked by accountants in Austin, and stored in Manhattan banks. That\u0027s called having your apple and eating it too. It\u0027s up to our leaders, not corporate executives, to fix this problem.Comments (247)Carol J. CarterAuthor and student success expertSuccess in college and life comes from gaining knowledge and skills. The more you take responsibility for carving your own path of adventure, the more your true abilities will emerge.CommentsErnest OwensCommunication \u0026 Public Service scholar, University of PennsylvaniaUnlike many rappers in hip-hop who are obvious industry pinheads just trying to cash into the bank, Kanye West knows more. Yet, that is perhaps the very problem: he knows more and yet does nothing to actually fix the problem.Comments (122)Tara EllisonAuthor, Synchronized BreathingHe had his arms around his new wife, protecting her, as if she was a tiny delicate flower and a strong wind was approaching. They were clearly in love in a way that we had never been. It was riveting to behold and yet also tremendously liberating.Comments (406)Meaghan GarveyIllustrator, writerKanye West is white America\u0027s worst nightmare. Because as much as one may attempt to dismiss him, you still have to turn on your regularly scheduled late night comedy program and stare him in the face. You can\u0027t avoid Kanye. He\u0027s made very sure of that.Comments (326)Keli GoffAuthor and Special Correspondent, TheRoot.comMuch like Matthew Shepard\u0027s death in 1998, the recent violence in New York will hopefully inspire some people who have been on the fence, and believe that LGBT rights is not their problem, to understand that regardless of your skin color, or sexual orientation, the fight for equal rights matters to all of us.Comments (15)Rabbi Shmuley BoteachRabbi and WriterWhatever the variation on this theme of the holocaust as punishment, let\u0027s be clear. These theories are ignorant, repulsive, and wrong.Comments (75)Tyler CurryFreelance columnist and fiction writer; creator, The Needle Prick ProjectHas the culture of stats, nudies and decapitated men begun to spill over into the rest our dating lives, making everything else look a little... cheap?Comments (38)Bailee UfertMusic and movie enthusiastThe 1980s were a blissful decade full of cringe-worthy fashion trends and pop music. The movies from the \u002780s are haunting in a good way; they leave us enamored and begging for more. Many of them have hidden messages, and some are more obvious.Comments (14)Keesha BeckfordMaster modern and jazz dance teacherWhen you are asked to work at something because that is simply what one does, many of you ask \"Why should I? So-and-so made this thing and it went mad viral.\" A few people are genuine overnight sensations -- results of our spectacle-hungry, media-addicted culture.Comments (30)Dr. John PierceWellness SpecialistDoctors and therapists often encourage people to decrease stress and \"stop and smell the roses,\" but how can you accomplish this when your day-to-day life is hectic and overwhelming? Here are a few simple lifestyle changes you can make to help reduce stress and improve your quality of life.CommentsMarcia CrossAward-winning actressWhen I think about how lucky I am that my husband survived, it only reinforces my dedication to taking action against this disease. My wish for every man faced with a cancer diagnosis is to have the same success story.CommentsRamzi KassemProfessor, City University of New York School of LawIn his years in office, Obama has retreated from the moral argument against Guantánamo. If he is serious about closing the prison and not repeating the errors of the past, then he should reclaim that moral high ground.Comments (20)JD Schramm, 2013.24.05Lea Lane, 2013.24.05Brad Friedman and Desi Doyen, 2013.23.05Laura Cococcia, 2013.23.05Jacqueline Brechner, 2013.23.05Jimmy Nguyen, 2013.23.05Sally Hansell, 2013.23.05Rick Steves, 2013.23.05Whitney Caudill, 2013.23.05Richard Barrington, 2013.23.05Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"TIME TO GO: HOLDER OK\u0027D PRESS PROBE",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
