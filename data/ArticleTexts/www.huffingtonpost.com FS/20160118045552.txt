{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027This could well be the first election since 2000 with an independent candidate. That has happened only four times in the past century, the others being 1912, 1948 and 2000. And a three-way -- or even a four-way race --would be a wild card. It could take any of several forms, with different partisan winners and losers. Consider: Suppose Donald Trump is the Republican nominee and Hillary Clinton is the Democrat. Establishment Republicans will be convinced that their party has been hijacked by a bizarre rabble-rouser; GOP elites will be unsure which is worse -- the prospect of Trump losing, or Trump winning. Result: pressure builds for a \"real\" Republican to run as an independent -- a conservative but not a rightwing populist. That could be, say, Paul Ryan, or John Kasich, or Mitt Romney again. Advantage: Democrats.Viewed hopefully, the Sanders campaign is the next stage of maturation in a rebirth of American progressivism. This time, people understand that no personality, however compelling, can ever change a country. Youthful progressive politics is growing up.Professor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027This prisoner release personifies the persistence and wisdom of the Obama administration\u0027s diplomatic efforts. This exchange is a direct result of the nuclear deal. It simply could not have happened without dialogue between the U.S. and Iran.Research Director, National Iranian American CouncilDear President Obama, I am writing this to you from the place where I was born -- Flint, Michigan. Please consider this personal appeal from me and the 102,000 citizens of the city of Flint who have been poisoned -- not by a mistake, not by a natural disaster, but by a governor and his administration who, to \"cut costs,\" took over the city of Flint from its duly elected leaders, unhooked the city from its fresh water supply of Lake Huron, and then made the people drink the toxic water from the Flint River.Oscar and Emmy-winning DirectorOur nation\u0027s first leaders fought bitterly over everything, but they agreed that certain principles were so fundamental to our character as a nation as to be inalienable. And while we have used the 240 years since the adoption of the Declaration of Independence to fight for civil and human rights for women and people of all races, ethnicities and sexual identities, freedom of religion was established from the start. This freedom cannot be switched off and on depending on current events.President, American Federation of TeachersThe American primary system for the nomination of presidential and congressional candidates, a system never mentioned in the constitution, has allowed populist anger to be exploited into a veto on foreign policy. Primaries, as they have evolved with the assistance of social media, have become an exercise that grants extraordinary electoral power to the dissatisfied and to the extremes.Adj Prof -Globalization, Baruch College, Faculty-NYU Center for Global Affairs. His new book-The Joint Ventured Nation:Why America Needs A New Foreign Policy will be published this fall by SkyhorseShame appears to be the only reason government officials in Flint, Michigan decided to pick up their pace helping the people of Flint. Flint is 37 percent Caucasian and 56 percent African-American.Professor of Broadcast \u0026 Digital Journalism, Calif State Univ Northridge and author of \u0027The Digital Media Pyramid\u0027With Hillary Clinton\u0027s frontrunner status in question, she used Sunday night\u0027s debate to unleash a sharpened wave of attacks on Bernie Sanders.Political reporter covering the Bernie Sanders campaignShrum-Cooke debate the sharp political contrasts of Oscar Week: Obama is Jimmy Stewart at the end of It\u0027s a Great Life while Republicans see only the despotic villain in Fury Road. And: Who won the Trump-Cruz exchange over Canada and New York... plus what really is PC?Host, \u0027Both Sides Now\u0027Today the immigration question is perhaps as divisive a force in American life as it has ever been, with leading presidential aspirants actually demonizing immigrants generally as criminals, deviants and undercover terrorists. In this season of celebration of Martin Luther King\u0027s birthday, it is important to revisit the factors that animated him in order to protect his memory from being misused to serve purposes that he would never embrace.Senior Fellow, The Opportunity AgendaThe story of my daughter Harper is that everybody\u0027s life, even if they have special needs, has a purpose.Mom, medical cannabis advocateWal-Mart headquarters announced January 15th that the company will close a total of 269 stores world-wide. This store implosion represents the end of the line for Wal-Mart\u0027s smallest format, the so-called Wal-Mart Express. It also reveals the giant retailer\u0027s over-saturation of American markets.Founder, Sprawl-BustersBernie has pulled out all the stops in an effort to court Latinos, but many are still unfamiliar with the left-leaning democratic socialist. If he wishes to solidify his support among Latinos, Bernie must broaden his definition of \"political revolution\"Author, \u0027Revolution! South America and the Rise of the New Left\u0027The battle over Yosemite Park\u0027s names isn\u0027t just about the famous Ahwahnee Hotel. Yes, it and the names of four other historic properties are part of the park\u0027s history. The Ahwahanee was named in 1927 and the Wawona Hotel was named in 1879. But it\u0027s really about corporate control of public goods.Executive Director, In the Public InterestWill Iran continue to comply with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) regulations? Will the extra cash, coming out of sanctions relief, trickle down to the Iranian people?President of the International American CouncilWe can keep dirty coal in the ground and protect our public lands from mining and generate electricity with clean energy and give people better jobs. Thanks to today\u0027s announcement, we\u0027re that much closer to making it happen.Executive Director, The Sierra ClubToday when Americans honor the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, they celebrate his public bravery, principles of human dignity and commitment to justice. They also follow his model of stepping into the public to engage in reasoned debate.Stanford UniversityUnfortunately, Chelsea Clinton misrepresented Senator Sanders\u0027 position, and her premiere performance on the stump backfired, producing a flood of political donations to Sanders.Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanySenior writer, BillMoyers.com. Former senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.When Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. marched, preached and toiled during the height of the Civil Rights Movement, he knew the sordid history of this country -- and was deeply mired in its bigoted present -- and yet, he still imagined that things could be different. He saw the ugliness but believed in the beauty. What would Dr. King think about our country today? I think he still would have hope. And here\u0027s why.Founder, President of the National Urban Alliance for Effective EducationAs the president noted in his State of the Union, the fact that the tone of politics hasn\u0027t changed is one of his lasting regrets. But \"it takes two to tango\" and from the performance of Trump and company, the other side doesn\u0027t appear ready to end the state of our dis-union.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027JAKARTA, Indonesia -- There is a base of support for ISIS in Indonesia. But public declarations by a thousand or two people do not represent active support for ISIS. Here, Islamic terrorism and professions of support for it remain curiosities.Public affairs commentator; former spokesman for President Abdurrahman Wahid (2000-01)It appears that it is not so much the policies, but the man (and party) supporting them, that earns universal condemnation from Republicans. Consider another policy that Rubin indignantly lists: Obama\u0027s recent executive actions on gun control.A NYC-based writer whose work has appeared on Salon, AlterNet, Counterpunch and openDemocracy. Follow him on Twitter: @dilgentbureauctObamacare has led to an historic increase in health insurance coverage for low- and moderate-income Americans. Republican plans for health insurance reform will likely cover fewer people, provide fewer benefits to low-income individuals, and possibly increase the federal deficit.author of America Is Not Post-Racial: Xenophobia, Islamophobia, Racism, and the 44th PresidentLike it or not, a country the size of Iran, which is enmeshed in several regional crises, can neither be ignored nor forced into submission without disastrous consequences.International security analyst/military historian.

I suppose that, as the daughter of both a former U.S. president and a potential U.S. president, she is somewhat credible by association, but what does that truly net?Serial digital entrepreneur and short fiction writerFor more than 30 years, I have been unearthing problems with the way the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) sells coal that belongs to the American people. Rather than serving the interests of the American taxpayer and the climate, the federal program has done what\u0027s best for coal companies.Massachusetts SenatorBlack boys have an especially difficult time as they approach adulthood, and I sometimes feel helpless when I think about all of the tools you\u0027ll need to navigate the world. Remember that no matter where your life leads, I will always be your mother, your friend and your number one fan!CEO \u0026 FounderThis inner dilemma that Rickman brought out in the character of Snape, that good and evil are everywhere but that we have the ability to choose what we want to be, is the most important lesson I learned from Harry Potter.A writer and college senior at Wesleyan University, Charlotte is fascinated by the intersection between film, theatre, television, and psychology.Now that I\u0027ve managed to turn my \"mess\" into my message, there were some \"rules\" I had to break, all in the name of health, wellness and importantly sanity.
