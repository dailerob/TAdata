Author of \"The Price of Civilization\"With President Obama\u0027s jobs speech on Monday and Speaker Boehner\u0027s jobs speech yesterday, we can put the Democratic and Republican Party economic plans side by side. What is stunning is that neither side offers a serious diagnosis or a solution.Read Post | Comments (505)Larry Magid, 9/17/11Technology journalistIt\u0027s important to pay attention to the serious problem of cyberbullying, but we need to keep it in perspective.

Bernie Sanders, 9/16/11Independent U.S. Senator from VermontIt\u0027s time to lift the veil of secrecy in the oil futures market.

They\u0027ve been negotiating about it. Some have used violence to achieve it. Now, say Palestinians, they\u0027ll finally become a state.

Websites like Politifact try to sort things out. But people still seem willing to believe the most negative things about two of our most durable social programs: Social Security and Medicare.Read Post | Comments (599)Jeff Reeves, 9/16/11Financial journalist, Editor, InvestorPlace.comAmericans need loans to start businesses, go to college, buy homes, protect themselves in times of crisis and countless other things. The nation needs to relearn how to use debt as a tool to build and protect wealth, not destroy it.Read Post | Comments (69)Cynthia Ellis, 9/16/11Writer/JournalistChristina Hendricks has the old-world, but never old, sex appeal of our Marilyn, and is perhaps our first red-headed pin-up since Rita Hayworth.
