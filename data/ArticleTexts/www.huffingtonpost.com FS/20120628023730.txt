{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressAs Mitt Romney\u0027s campaign has pursued its strategy in these late spring-to-early summer months, there\u0027s been one glaring gap: specifics. No one really has much of an idea what Romney wants to do in terms of policy or what issues he particularly wants to prioritize. Pundits have noticed. Let\u0027s recall Peggy Noonan\u0027s admonishment to Romney: \"Mr. Romney has to give us a plan. He has to tell us his priorities. To lead is to prioritize, to choose.\" This is a sentiment that\u0027s filtered into the Sunday morning political discussion. And meanwhile, the vacuum he\u0027s been permitted to open has been very well filled by the negative ads that the Obama campaign has launched in the swing states, ads that went heavy on attacking -- that\u0027s right! -- Romney\u0027s record at Bain.Read Post | Comments (121)Rita Wilson, 06/27/12Editor at Large, Huff/Post50; Actor, Producer, SingerNora celebrated life to an insatiable degree, yet without any of the manic energy one associates with people who have \"insatiable appetites\" for life.

I won\u0027t get near the first two right now, but I\u0027ll hazard a guess on what the Court is likely to decide tomorrow: It will uphold the constitutionality of Obamacare by a vote of 6 to 3.Read Post | Comments (671)Arianna Huffington, 06/26/12Nora Ephron is gone -- and I can\u0027t believe it. She\u0027ll be cherished as a wife and mother, and a devoted, giving, treasured -- and irreplaceable -- friend.
