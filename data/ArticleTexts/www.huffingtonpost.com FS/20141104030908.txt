{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027As folks know who are either familiar with the data or live in the real world, the economy still bad for most people. Obama can rightly say that he inherited a mess from his predecessor, but at some point that does get old. He can also honestly blame the Republicans in Congress who have eagerly proclaimed their opposition to any economic proposal that doesn\u0027t have the primary purpose of making the rich even richer. While the grim reality can offer legitimate excuses, the Democrats still suffered from the fact that they didn\u0027t have a real economic agenda for the bulk of the population. The Republicans at least have a clear agenda. Everyone knows if they get back in control they will give everything left on the table to the richest 1 percent. But what would the Democrats do?To seal the deal and truly begin to close a harrowingly destructive chapter in American history, voters going to the ballot box Tuesday need to understand how the War on Drugs has failed, in every way, for over forty years.Award-winning filmmaker, public thinker, and authorThere is still suspense over what will happen on Election Day, with control of the Senate hanging in the balance. But regardless of who wins, we already know the 2014 election belongs to the U.S. Supreme Court.Democracy Program Director, Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of LawDeputy Director, Brennan Center for Justice Democracy ProgramSo far there haven\u0027t been very many progressives willing to stick their head out there and say they\u0027re willing to take on Team Hillary. I understand that the Washington media is saying that she can\u0027t be beat. That\u0027s hilarious. Isn\u0027t that exactly what they said in 2008?Host, \u0027The Young Turks\u0027If the Republican Party takes full control of the U.S. Congress in the midterm election, policy gridlock is likely to worsen, risking a rerun of the damaging fiscal battles that led last year to a government shutdown and almost to a technical debt default. More broadly, the gridlock will prevent the passage of important structural reforms that the U.S. needs to boost growth.Chairman of Roubini Global Economics, Professor of Economics at the Stern School of BusinessIt would be comforting to think that life and death decisions are made more deliberately than traffic navigation, but this is not the case. Indeed, they are often at least as rushed and impulsive, with emotions running overwhelmingly high.Psychotherapist; Executive/life coachShe was Yolande, daughter of the King of Aragon before the country joined with Castile to make today\u0027s Spain. The only child of her father to reach adulthood, Yolande became the kingdom\u0027s heiress after the death of her childless uncle.Author and Historian; author of the acclaimed Anjou Trilogy and frequent lecturer and historical writer.There are infinite varieties of men or at least about 3.5 billion different ones living on Earth now, Klansmen and human rights activists, drag queens and duck hunters. For the purposes of feminism, I\u0027d like to delineate three big blurry categories.Author, \u0027Men Explain Things to Me\u0027Voters are facing an ugly surprise on their way to the voting booth on Tuesday. What most people don\u0027t realize is that since 2006, some 34 state legislatures have worked diligently to chip away at the fundamental right to vote -- and overwhelmingly, people of color are the target.Director, ACLU Washington Legislative OfficeBarring a miracle, Tuesday is likely to be an unhappy Election Day for the Democrats. They will need to win virtually every close race to hold the Senate, and that seems unlikely. They are on track to suffer losses in the House as well. Could it have been different? I think so.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027In the early hours of Election Day, before dawn reaches the nation\u0027s capital, Justice Anthony Kennedy is suddenly awakened by someone standing next to his bed. \"Who are you?\" demands the Justice. \"I am the ghost of Election Day Past.\"Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027You would think that TV stations have a public-interest obligation to cover government, public affairs, important issues - stories citizens need to know. After all, stations owners pay nothing for the licenses the public gives them to broadcast over the airwaves the public owns. But if you believe that, you\u0027d be wrong.USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorHubris Syndrome is an acquired personality change that occurs in powerful leaders. Because the people who develop it hold power, the effects of their hubris can be widespread and, in some cases, extremely damaging to many people.Former British foreign secretaryThe recognition by the US of the Kurds in Syrian-occupied Kurdistan as an ally against ISIS is a positive step but must be followed by US recognition of the Kurds in Syria and elsewhere as an oppressed people with legitimate national rights and aspirations.Teacher, translator, and author of The Azadi English-Kurdish DictionaryWhere the culture conversation is happening. Users shape, share and debate their opinions on anything and everything through Top 10 lists.Using names or acronyms of mental illnesses to hyperbolize innocuous idiosyncrasies and experiences has become pervasive in our cultural dialogue. It is important we end this trend, because making these flippant references trivializes how devastating the illnesses can be and perpetuates myths and misunderstandings.Health Communications Specialist, Invisible Illness AdvocateAs most of you know, I am not a fan of diets. The reason is that we follow a certain diet for a while, and then we fall off the wagon as we are unable to sustain it, and so often, end up discouraged. Better to adopt a healthy lifestyle you can sustain for the long haul.Nationally-recognized nutritionist; International Speaker; Adjunct professor of nutrition at NYU; Author, \u0027The Portion Teller Plan\u0027We\u0027ve got six states in the Too Close To Call category, but fear not! After providing a rundown of the races, I am adding a section below where I make my own picks for each of them (since it is Election Eve, after all, and thus time to put up or shut up).Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comImagine learning that your terminal illness could be cured only to be told that you were going to denied access to the medication that could save you. This is precisely the situation facing thousands of people living with the hepatitis C virus (HCV).New York deputy state director, Drug Policy AllianceThere is an undercurrent of thinking in foreign policy circles that a restrained, less actively engaged approach to the country\u0027s external relations may best conform to American national interests and capabilities.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghNew York, don\u0027t be fooled by Weingarten\u0027s not-so-subtle Cuomo endorsement. You do have a choice.Public school teacher, education activist, PhDAs I predicted two months ago, California voters have been bombarded by a group with a consumer-friendly name warning that a vote for a ballot initiative tomorrow would allow \"one politician\" to \"interfere\" with their health care treatment options.Author, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgThe polls for Tuesday look grim for weak-kneed and squeamish Democrats who have not stood up for Obama--or the substantial achievements of his party--over the last six years.Former reporter for the New York Times and Daily News; taught Political Science at NYUThe Common Core approach to reading is like breaking a molecule down into individual elements. Once you break the molecular bonds that tie the atoms together, you lose all the properties of the original chemical. You now have hydrogen and oxygen, but you no longer have water.Social studies educator, Hofstra University, my opinions, of course, are my ownMake no mistake about it: every time a newspaper cuts a chess column, chess loses.International Chess GrandmasterMy encounter with the virulently anti-gay Benham brothers at the Values Voter Summit had me asking myself: What makes men \"gay\"? Of course, I don\u0027t mean what makes people actually homosexual, biologically, or what inspires them to desire gay sex. Rather, what makes men appear \"gay\" within popular culture and thought to be gay even by gay men themselves?Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesAs Leonardo DiCaprio states right off the top in the documentary, \"Climate change is happening now and is caused by human activity.\" That means we must fundamentally change human activity.Bestselling author and host of a nationally syndicated, progressive talk showWriter, reporter, and philosopher in Washington, DCMoney is pouring into this year\u0027s mid-term election -- mostly from the pockets of right-wing billionaires. The total is projected to top $4 billion. Thirteen states have annual budgets of $4 billion or less.President, AFL-CIOAt the end of a campaign, we should know more about our country, our fellow citizens and those who want to represent us. Instead we are awash in malicious advertising and name-calling.Producer and Host, \u0027The Paula Gordon Show\u0027There are many sources of uncertainty in election polling other than sampling error. One source of error that looms large in this year\u0027s closest races is undecided voters -- people who say they are going to vote, but don\u0027t know (or won\u0027t say) which candidate they prefer.Professor of Political Science at Stanford UniversitySo go ahead and hashtag your devotion, but learn the cause. Above all, think collectively -- meaning outside your own personal needs. Think about the needs of your sisters around the word and for generations to come.Author of Beautiful Garbage: A Novel, and Professor of EnglishGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"TWILIGHT",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
