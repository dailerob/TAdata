{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Our current political situation is unprecedented. The vast majority of Americans keep falling behind economically because of changes in society\u0027s ground rules, while the rich get even richer -- yet this situation doesn\u0027t translate into a winning politics. If anything, the right keeps gaining and the wealthy keep pulling away. How can this possibly be? In the face of all these assaults on the working and middle class, there are many movements but no Movement. The Occupy movement, which gave us the phrase, \"The One Percent,\" was too hung up on its own procedural purity to create a broad movement for economic justice. This vicious circle can be reversed, as it has been reversed at moments in the American past. As that noted political consultant Joe Hill put it, as they were taking him to the gallows, \"Don\u0027t mourn, organize.\"Multiculturalism should not mean that we tolerate another culture\u0027s intolerance. If we do in fact support diversity, women\u0027s rights, and gay rights, then we cannot in good conscience give Islam a free pass on that spurious ground.Author, Heretic: Why Islam Needs a Reformation NowFor now, as Cruz officially announces his 2016 bid, he is nearly an asterisk in the early GOP polls, well behind somewhat less apocalyptic personalities, such as Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. But there are several reasons to take Cruz seriously.Editorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupFactual information is out of fashion. American society now devalues it. Subjective attitude and opinion are considered to be as worthy as accurate renderings of reality. Many wear their ignorance as a badge of honor.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghJust as the U.S. wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya fertilized the field for IS, another U.S. war, the so-called War on Drugs, opened new horizons for the drug cartels.Author, \u0027Mainstreaming Torture\u0027Unless the campaign financing system is reformed, the U.S. Congress will become paid employees of the people who pay for their campaigns -- the billionaire class. Needless to say, not everyone on the Committee agreed.Independent U.S. Senator from VermontProstitution as portrayed in Pretty Woman is just about as far as you can get from the truth. Prostitution is ugly. Most of it is sex trafficking. It\u0027s intriguing to read that the movie\u0027s script originally was written as a dark, cautionary tale. That, from my perspective as a survivor, gets at the sad reality.Project manager for women’s justice programs and human-trafficking coordinator, Cook County Sheriff’s OfficeAmerica clings to the conceit that four years of college are necessary for everyone, and looks down its nose at people who don\u0027t have college degrees. This has to stop. It\u0027s time to give up the idea that every young person has to go to college, and start offering high-school seniors an alternative route into the middle class.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Iran\u0027s deplorable record is not a reason to walk away. It is the very reason we must hammer out a iron-clad agreement to ensure Iran cannot get it\u0027s hands on a nuclear bomb.President, Ploughshares Fund; Author, \u0027Nuclear Nightmares: Securing the World Before It Is Too Late\u0027ISIS has been operating from the pedophile\u0027s playbook.Professor of Security Studies, University of Massachusetts, Lowell; research fellow, Center for Terrorism and Security StudiesEmanuel and Cuomo are \"progr-actionaries.\" They\u0027re reliably left on social issues and reliably right on economic issues like tax policy, unions, and corporate giveaways.Senior Fellow, DemosCritical thinking is NOT starting with the conclusion that you want to reach and then constructing a bridge of arguments specifically designed to get you there, and yet this is perilously close to the kind of thinking a standardized test requires.Teacher and writer; blogger, curmudgucation.blogspot.comNigeria\u0027s more than 70 million voters will soon go to the polls to choose their country\u0027s leader for the next four years. Whether the victor is incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan or opposition challenger Muhammadu Buhari is entirely for Nigerians to decideU.S. Secretary of StateForests benefit the world, and each of us, every day in countless ways that are all too easy to overlook. On this year\u0027s International Day of Forests, let\u0027s make a promise to do more to ensure healthy, productive forests for future generations.President and CEO, Sustainable Forestry Initiative Inc.Lee Kuan Yew died on Monday at the age of 91. And with his demise, modern Asia has lost all of its postwar political wizards, men and women who carved entire countries from the clangor of colonial rule or from disputes with neighbors. This year, his beloved Singapore will mark its 50th anniversary of independence.Bestselling author, historian, biographer, foreign correspondentMy family does not look like me. We don\u0027t share the same DNA. But our family ties are real and our economic stability is interdependent. We must make sure the rights of each person and their families are equally protected.Activist, writer, freelance strategist and trainer for social justice causesNo surprise that almost four months into the Republican takeover of Congress, more time has been spent on immigration -- specifically, trying to reverse President Obama\u0027s executive actions shielding 5 million immigrants from deportation -- than almost anything else.Univision America Host \u0026 contributor to NPR, The Hill, FoxNews Latino and other mediaLowry \u0026 Corn clash over Netanyahu\u0027s win-- Arabs-are-coming plus 3 positions on 2 States in 36 hours. Lombardi \u0026 Durocher: \"Win any way you can so long as you get away with it.\" What should Obama \u0026 Clinton do now? Then: is Mandatory Voting anti-liberty or a civic obligation like jury duty?Host, \u0027Both Sides Now\u0027Carrying water is not only hard work; it is dangerous work as well. A woman walking miles through the rural African bush alone isn\u0027t safe. So, women are exposed to violence and shame, which limits their possibilities for education, marriage, better health and other prospects.President, World VisionAs someone who was raised in a family of atheists (and whose father taught high school science), I often find myself standing on the sidelines as hordes of true believers abandon all objectivity and embrace a new technology, a cherished sport, or a form of corporate mythology with gusto.San Francisco-based arts criticWhen the House released its budget last Tuesday, Georgia Republican Rep. Rob Woodall said, \"A budget is a moral document; it talks about where your values are.\" His chamber\u0027s spending plan shows that Republicans highly value war and place no value on health care for America\u0027s elderly, working poor and young adults.International President, United SteelworkersDespite past voting obstacles, there are compelling reasons for blacks in Ferguson to rush to barricades this time to vote. One is the prospect of a regime change. Another is they could move to dump the racket that city officials have run for years that criminalizes virtually the city entire black population. Another is there\u0027s no excuse.Author and political analystJust when Israel\u0027s existence and influence on the world stage is most important for Jews around the world, it cannot afford to risk that for the self-aggrandizement of Benjamin Netanyahu. The way he won his election has weakened Israel, destroyed its credibility and made it far less secure.Last person on Earth not on FacebookHealth care is a human right and fundamental for a moral society. The ACA and its many provisions are important steps on our journey to health justice, a path that requires all of us (healthcare providers, elected officials, public health experts, and \"ordinary\" people) to do our part for our fellow Americans.Host of \"Dr. America\" on We Act Radio, pediatrician in Washington DC, member of the National Physicians AllianceAchieving affordable access to safe water and sanitation for all has been one of humanity\u0027s most intractable problems. This is despite the fact that billions of us take these services for granted. We have known how to deliver affordable, safe water for more than 100 years yet for more than 2.5 billion people these services are absent.Gary WhiteWe discover, laid bare by an expert, the inner workings of the staggering extortion scheme that is the heart of Putin\u0027s system, and we understand that the act of revealing those workings is the most unforgivable crime in the country.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.The ACA is far more than a concept. It has become a right for the more than 8 million Americans who have gained coverage under the law. Now what conservatives are trying to do is rip away what can be literally life saving coverage.Mayor of Jersey City, New JerseyThe more we can make ourselves feel whole and worthy as individuals, the more we have to give to the world. With this in mind, here are eight beautiful and effective ways to increase your self-love.Writer and founder of NotesOnBliss.com, your guidebook to happiness and creating a beautiful lifeIn the lead up to Israel\u0027s March 17th election, Prime Minister Benjamin (Bibi) Netanyahu, fearful that he might lose his reelection bid, threw caution to the wind making blatant appeals to scare voters into returning him to office.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027There\u0027s a big difference between giving an explanation, and making an excuse. Excuses harbor guilt and shame; they rationalize bad behaviors, and set the table for a mediocre life. Here are 12 steps to permanently remove excuses from your life...Balancing Science \u0026 Spirituality, Helping you live your dream -- TheUtopianLife.comI applaud Schultz for wanting to be socially conscious but that shouldn\u0027t include potentially forcing me to engage in a conversation of Starbucks\u0027 choosing. By doing so, the company is limiting my freedom of choice to discuss race when I want to, where I want to, and with whom I want to.Author and commentatorGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"TED TALKS: \u0027I\u0027M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT\u0027",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
