{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Director, Arms and Security Project, Center for International PolicySo far much of the discussion on the Democratic side has centered on crucial domestic issues like how to reduce inequality or how to make college more affordable. There has been much less attention paid to life-and-death issues of foreign policy and national security. That needs to change. Whether it happens Tuesday night or not, the candidates eventually have to go beyond reassuring rhetoric to engage in a detailed discussion of their strategy for protecting the country -- and how they would pay for it. Do they have a plan to further reduce the world\u0027s massive stockpile of nuclear weapons? Will they vigorously defend and faithfully implement the Iran nuclear deal in the face of ongoing opposition? What are their proposals for dealing with climate change, which is as much a security issue as it is an environmental one?Obama, with his lawyer\u0027s training, is risk averse, so he naturally prefers the line of least resistance. As the anti-Bush, his approach to strategy boils down to \"Don\u0027t do stupid s***.\" But that, like \"strategic patience,\" is just another way of saying, \"Always kick the can down the road.\"Laurence A. Tisch Professor of History at Harvard University; Senior Fellow of the Hoover Institution, Stanford UniversityAs a society, we may feel safer by believing the threat of violence can be ascribed to one group of people. Like human nature, however, the truth is more complicated.NFL wide receiver; Co-founder, PROJECT 375Boehner has already nominated himself as the Republican Party\u0027s sacrificial lamb. But on his way out, he could also be a very effective scapegoat, thus sparing both his party and the country at large a whole lot of needless drama and economic instability.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comThose of us who don\u0027t think it\u0027s the best use of government money to give subsidized loans to some of the largest companies in the world have to recognize political reality. With enough campaign contributions on the table, Congress will eventually vote to approve the money.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027What choices do progressives have? Hillary Clinton leaves a lot to be desired. She does favor a woman\u0027s right to choose and has recently come out in support of marriage equality. But, Clinton has been called a \"focus group Democrat,\" often accused of believing what polls and focus groups tell her she should believe.Professor, Thomas Jefferson School of LawWhy do we honor a man who, if he were alive today, would almost certainly be sitting on Death Row awaiting execution?Founder and CEO of the Imagine Institute, a think tankSports takes you out of the skinny girl mentality, out of the sexual object category, and allows you to embrace yourself without self-consciousness and own who you are. That does not make us less of a woman. It makes us more.Actress and authorISIS\u0027s mad, avowed determination to butcher every \"infidel\" -- including not just non-Muslims but Shiites and more moderate Muslims as well -- would make the government\u0027s case for passport revocation a strong one, so long as full due process safeguards are afforded.Simeon E. Baldwin Professor Emeritus, Yale Law SchoolTuesday\u0027s Democratic debate is a very big deal, especially for front-runner Hillary Clinton. Bernie Sanders will probably exceed expectations because many viewers will be seeing him for the first time, certainly for the first time against Clinton.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The research on guns and gun ownership is clear. Having firearms in your home makes everyone who lives there more likely to be a victim of gun violence, period. That\u0027s irresponsible parenting.Writer, educator, mental health advocate and mother of fourThere\u0027s no reason for the US to swallow a trade deal filled with rotten rodent terms. American workers know for sure that if the scheme contains any foie gras, it\u0027ll be served on silver platters to corporations while workers are force-fed rats. America should withdraw. Congress should reject the TPP.International President, United SteelworkersThe Wisconsin legislature is going the extra mile with three separate bills to retroactively decriminalize the behavior at the heart of the investigation and to defang the nonpartisan elections agency that aided it. Two of the bills are on a fast track being sped through the legislature with an unusual Joint Senate/Assembly hearing on Tuesday.The Center for Media and Democracy/ALEC ExposedThe Tea Party wing of the House Republican party is seeking changes in the rules and procedures. Changes designed to strip the Speaker of the ability to assemble a majority within the House and enable that majority to govern. They cloak their demands in the language of bottom-up democracy. But their complaints about John Boehner\u0027s leadership give away the game. Former executive director and chairman, Sierra Club\"The question, Mr. Speaker, is not whether we like Saddam Hussein or not. The question is whether he represents an imminent threat to the American people and whether a unilateral invasion of Iraq will do more harm than good.\"Democratic candidate for President, US Senator from VermontWhile there are American-style liberals in China, some intellectuals and others view freedom through a different, and they say Chinese, prism. Some reject U.S.-style democracy without exactly affirming CCP-led autocracy. Everyone wants to be heard, but they don\u0027t necessarily want everyone else, especially the rural masses, to be heard.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteLike many people, I was outraged when I saw the video of Florida judge Jerri Collins throwing a woman in jail after holding her in contempt of court for not showing up to testify against her allegedly abusive husband.Chief Executive Officer of the National Domestic Violence Hotline and loveisrespectThe shocking truth people are finding out about Hillary Clinton is she has always been a real progressive. A progressive who understands how government works and that our founding fathers (to their shame there were no founding mothers) set up a government requiring compromise to move ideas forward.Political consultantThis summer, after a hazy August afternoon of poolside BBQ­ing and malaise at my uncle\u0027s house, my hyper-­inquisitive cousin Mikey hit me with a question I\u0027ve dreaded for my most of my adult life: \"Hey, Louie,\" he began earnestly, \"have you ever had a boyfriend?\"DJCurrently, the largest national prescription for school shooting prevention happens to be active shooter training. Everyone wants to be prepared. And we should be. Just like we need to be prepared for all types of disasters, manmade or natural.School Safety Advocate, Educator, AuthorInstead of concentrating on my time with my mother, I spent most of it worrying. It\u0027s not the inevitability of the outcome that matters in these situations, it\u0027s the little bits of control we are given in times where so much of it has been taken away. And that would have changed so much.author, veterinarian, and death fairyWhen I left the doctor\u0027s office, I went back to my office, went in the bathroom, took one last cigarette out of the pack I had, and smoked it. I flushed the rest of the cigarettes down the toilet. I was done.Recovery advocate, writer, and proud father of a person in long-term recovery.The more cutting debate about Kissinger and his works has to do with his conduct rather than his philosophy.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghOn a chilly night in 2013, as the stress of the semester was coming to a peak, I had the most scarring experience of my life. Being sexually assaulted -- raped -- shattered my self-image and confidence in my own voice. My self-worth was stolen from me by someone I previously trusted.Harvard senior studying neurobiology.Carson\u0027s fantasy scenario is the one that reflects the way many Americans approach the issue of guns. The fantasists have come to believe that if they had a gun, they\u0027d be able to ensure their own safety and the safety of those around them.Author of \u0027Obama’s America: A Transformative Vision of Our National Identity\u0027We took our baby girl home from the hospital soon after we took her off life support. We signed \"Do Not Resuscitate\" documents and we were assigned hospice care especially for children. It took 21 days. With each cavernous minute, I prayed for death to be swift.A writer working on a memoir, In the Womb of Love, about the death of her first-born daughter who lived only one month. www.AidaSalazar.comDid you see the YouTube video titled \"Drunk Kid Wants Mac and Cheese\"? It went viral last Tuesday. Did you laugh at the UConn student demanding his favorite jalapeno-flavored drunk food? Did you think the belligerent, slurring and entitled kid was funny? If you did, let me tell you why you\u0027re wrong.Second-year law student at Georgetown University. Graduated magna cum laude from UConn in 2014. Originally from Cheshire, CT.To describe this darkest hour in our nation\u0027s history as simply being based on a racist hatred of people of African descent is to miss the complexity of the transatlantic slave trade and the work of enslaved Africans in America.University Chaplain, University of PennsylvaniaPrivate prisons are a cancer. Private prisons make money by locking people up, and the more people they lock up for more time, the more money they make. Private prisons are morally distasteful, they don\u0027t save money, and they have historic performance problems. But they persist. Why does this cancer continue to grow?Author, Making MannaThe greatest strength of \"Steve Jobs,\" the farthest cry from a cradle to the grave biopic since \"I\u0027m Not There,\" is that it knows when to cut us loose and leave us to stew with questions in the wake of this flawed but omnipotent superpower.Memoirist, Film lover/writerSaying \u0027this is like the Nazis\u0027 or \u0027that is like the Holocaust\u0027 is one of the great rhetorical temptations around and, unfortunately, too many succumb to it\u0027s allure.Executive Editor Of Global Spirituality and Religion, The Huffington PostGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
