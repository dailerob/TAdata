{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Children\u0027s Defense FundWhy are we so terrified of one other, even during periods when actual crime rates go down? There is an obvious connection between that feeling of terror and the culture of violence that saturates Americans in violent language, violent imagery, and violent entertainment. Right now, instead of responding as parents and a nation by saying no to the culture of violence, we are apparently responding by defensively arming ourselves with more and bigger weapons. If that cycle of violence and fear is having such a deep psychological impact on adults, how do we expect our children to navigate or survive it? What is it about American culture that encourages tens of millions of Americans to either use guns as a form of entertainment or feel so fearful they believe they need guns in their homes, including semiautomatic weapons and high-capacity ammunition clips designed specifically to kill large numbers of other people, to feel a sense of safety?Read Post | Comments (298)Marlo Thomas, 12/22/12Award-winning actress, author and activistI love a good Christmas story and this one from my dear friend Whoopi Goldberg gets me every time. It\u0027s a beautiful and simple story that I just had to share this holiday season. Happy Holidays to you all, and I wish you much magic! --MTRead Post | Comments (49)Cory Booker, 12/21/12Mayor of NewarkHere are gun law reforms that alone will save thousands upon thousands of Americans, and joined with other reasonable reforms, can truly turn the tide on gun violence in this country.Read Post | Comments (706)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 12/22/12Author, research psychologist and gender scholarThis year, remind yourself that you do a lot for your children every single day. Keep your efforts turned inward, and resist the temptation to use others\u0027 experiences as personal motivation even when it seems like everyone else is giving their kid the perfect holiday.Read Post | CommentsGary Hart, 12/22/12President, Hart International, Ltd.Instead of politicians defending a fictional \"right\" to bear military weapons, whether out of conviction or fear, it would be more American and humane to spend our time considering and protecting the rights of our children to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.Read Post | Comments (171)Phil Plait, 12/21/12Astronomer, AuthorIt only takes one asteroid, 100 or so meters across, impacting the Earth to explode with the force of a dozen nuclear weapons.

So what do we do?Read Post | Comments (1,075)Bob Cesca, 12/21/12Political Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowUltimately, video games, television and so forth are only reflections of American culture and consumer demand. If we break the culture, if we disrupt the firearm marketplace, consumer demand and the media marketplace will begin to adjust accordingly.Read Post | Comments (689)James Zogby, 12/22/12President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027The lack of understanding in the West for the plight of Bethlehem and our silence in the face of its suffering is a metaphor for the entire Palestinian situation. In our mind\u0027s eye we can clearly see Israel and our imagined Bethlehem, but the Palestinian people of today do not exist.Read Post | Comments (194)Robert Reich, 12/21/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027This has become a party of hypocrisy masquerading as principled ideology. The GOP talks endlessly about the importance of reducing the budget deficit. But it isn\u0027t even willing to raise revenues from the richest three-tenths of one percent of Americans to help with the task.Read Post | Comments (943)Joe Peyronnin, 12/21/12Hofstra Journalism ProfessorSimply put, the NRA\u0027s answer to gun violence, one greatest plagues facing America today, is more guns.Read Post | Comments (433)Arianna Huffington, 12/21/12This week\u0027s issue of Huffington largely focuses on the tragedy in Newtown, bringing together essays and moving photos to capture the horror and heartbreak of that day. Peter Goodman writes of the natural tendency, and the folly, of trying to make sense of such violence. And as we move forward as a country, the urge \"to grieve and hold our children close,\" as Lisa Belkin puts it, is not enough.Read Post | Comments (102)Rev.

El-Erian, 12/21/12CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOIn order to avoid a recession that would aggravate the country\u0027s unemployment problem and reignite concerns about housing and household finances, Democrats and Republicans need quickly to find a way to work together.Read Post | Comments (113)Alex Gibney, 12/21/12FilmmakerIt\u0027s difficult for one filmmaker to criticize another. That\u0027s a job best left to critics. However, in the case of Zero Dark Thirty, about the hunt for Osama bin Laden, an issue that is central to the film -- torture -- is so important that I feel I must say something.Read Post | Comments (143)Seth Shostak, 12/21/12Senior Astronomer, SETI InstituteBuying insurance is seldom gratifying.

Heartbreak comes from a discrepancy in intentions and expectations.Read Post | Comments (18)Dan Treadway, 12/21/12Associate blog editor, The Huffington PostI just wish that LaPierre had been given more time to pass around more blame for gun violence in America. Given the opportunity to further expand on the true culprits, there\u0027s little doubt that the NRA would happily blame America\u0027s deadly epidemic on any number of things.Read Post | Comments (117)Dr. Lee Bowes, 12/20/12CEO, America Works of New York, Inc.Networking gives you the advantage in the job hunt. By using connections and networks, you differentiate your name from the thousands of other online applications. Employers are quick to rely on networks because they save time and they are more reliable than résumés.Read Post | CommentsGuy Branum, 12/21/12Writer and comedianSilver\u0027s refusal to fully participate in gay identity is the real problem. We must acknowledge the cultural forces that allow a person to participate in homosexual sex while feeling like the concerns, bigotries and culture that surround homosexuality do not apply to them.Read Post | Comments (374)Jim Sleeper, 12/21/12Lecturer in Political Science, Yale UniversityAbsent a better politics, it\u0027s hard to imagine what might change the climate at a lot of local TV news shows that play up every nasty crime, or among the producers of internet games. We have to make them realize that they\u0027re doing something to kids and to our society that, as parents, and citizens, they\u0027re already living to regret.Read Post | Comments (33)Meryl Davids Landau, 12/19/12Author of the spiritual women\u0027s novel, \u0027Downward Dog, Upward Fog\u0027When Dr. Terry Wahls found herself unable to walk or even sit up in a wheelchair, she became determined to improve. Having already seen the best doctors at the renowned Cleveland Clinic and taken the state-of-the-art drugs, she knew she had to do something radical.Read Post | Comments (179)Mario Livio, 12/21/12Astrophysicist, Space Telescope Science InstituteThere is no doubt that a huge asteroid impact on Earth would be devastating to many life forms. However, we often forget that asteroid impacts may have played a crucial role in the emergence of life on Earth, and possibly even in the fact that humans are here to talk about them!Read Post | Comments (15)Devon Corneal, 12/21/12Lawyer, MotherIn that moment, I realized I have a much longer list for Santa than I thought. I may not want presents under the tree and an overflowing stocking, but I want. I want a list of things a mile long.
