{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranThe counter-insurgency strategy in Afghanistan has failed, and it is time for President Obama to abandon it. In the wake of the horrific incident where a US soldier killed 16 innocent Afghans, and just weeks after American Marines were caught on tape desecrating the body of a dead enemy, and a pile of Korans were burned, that much is clear. It is time to employ a mission in Afghanistan that actually works, and leave a residual force in the region that focuses on destroying real threats to America.

Colonel, Air ForceIf a nuclear-armed Iran is indeed the greatest threat we as a nation face, that is indeed good news.
