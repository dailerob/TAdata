{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"APFrom news.yahoo.comIllegal warrantless wiretapping -- and the administration\u0027s unrelenting mendacity about it -- is not only wrong on principle but a perfect wedge issue for Democrats. But only if they correctly frame the issue. So far, the Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee have adopted a strong tone with Alberto Gonzales. But Democrats have an ignominious recent history of coming out of the gate hard, then quickly sounding retreat as soon as the White House cries \"soft on defense!\" This time, they need to stay on the offensive, making the case every chance they can that our national security is being undercut by Bush\u0027s lawbreaking and lies.READ POST | comments (21)02.06.2006 Jane SmileyIslamic rioters are like South Carolinians in the antebellum US -- to fail to respond to an insult is to fail to maintain one\u0027s honor. The humiliation seems worse than mere death or injury.READ POST | comments (23)02.06.2006 Steve ClemonsWhat is the Pentagon and Don Rumsfeld hiding? The media WILL NOT receive the budget materials until the opportunity to question Rumsfeld about them has passed.READ POST | comments (15)02.05.2006 Marty KaplanYes, it\u0027s really puzzling, how such a grounded, sensible lad like George Deutsch could go from college, to the Bush campaign, to become the scourge of the NASA scientific community.READ POST | comments (19)02.06.2006 Bryan LentzIt\u0027s up to the press, the watchdog groups, and ordinary citizens to shine the spotlight on people like Curt Weldon, and to shame Congress into action.READ POST | comments (11)02.06.2006 Kirsten PowersRegardless if you are a Hillary lover or Hillary hater, anyone who is a Democrat should have their antenna up as a result of the RNC Chairman\u0027s statement that \"Hillary looks angry.\"READ POST | comments (62)02.06.2006 Bob BurnettIt appears that the White House has gone on a massive \"fishing trip;\" one that invades the privacy of thousands of ordinary Americans and violates the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act.READ POST | comments (27)02.06.2006 Paul KrassnerAfter Ratso Sloman ghost-wrote Howard Stern\u0027s autobiography, \"Private Parts,\" he compiled an oral biography of Abbie Hoffman, \"Steal This Dream.\" Stern wasn\u0027t impressed.READ POST | comments (11)02.06.2006 Deepak ChopraA coca farmer has been elected president in Bolivia and a socialist doctor in Chile. Hamas has won majority power in Palestine and a hard-line anti-Zionist leads Iran. These are all democratic outcomes, and in the foreseeable future we can expect more of the same.READ POST | comments (22)02.06.2006 Danny GoldbergIn the latest example of conservative self-deception, David Brooks, in his New York Times op-ed column on Super Bowl Sunday, is alternatively absurd, misleading and delusional.READ POST | comments (30)02.06.2006 Mark KleimanClark had a meeting with bloggers in LA yesterday. He offered some complicated thoughts on Iraq, and suggested that military action against Iran is perfectly feasible from a technical standpoint, but risky in terms of Iranian politics.READ POST | comments (23)02.05.2006 Al EiseleBritish Prime Minister Tony Blair was reminded once again last week that there\u0027s definitely a downside to being a staunch supporter of President Bush\u0027s Iraq war policy.READ POST | comments (15)02.05.2006 David FidererCheney knew full well that the smear campaign against Joe Wilson was intended to promote a lie. When will a journalist or public figure, outside the blogosphere, ever have enough balls to say that Dick Cheney is a liar?READ POST | comments (42)02.05.2006 Raymond J. LearsyThe impact of high oil prices on our economy is widely known. What is not so widely understood is the impact these prices are having in providing \"walking around money\" to radical elements in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, etc.READ POST | comments02.05.2006 Suzanne NosselIt\u0027s hard to remember the last time anyone got seriously mad at the Scandinavians. These incidents are more evidence that relations between the West and the Muslim world are moving in the wrong direction.READ POST | comments (49)02.05.2006 Peter DaouRightwing attack dogs maul Bush\u0027s critics as traitors. Left-leaning bloggers and online activists go ballistic. Newspaper editorials echo these sentiments but quickly move on. Spin.

She was special, and I wasfortunate to have been her friend.READ POST | comments (21)02.06.2006 Lawrence BenderTo watch the number one PUSHER, George Bush, talk about our \"addiction to oil\" just made me blow a proverbial gasket.READ POST | comments (22)02.05.2006 Donnie FowlerIt took a rock star to lay out what Christianity -- indeed, all the world\u0027s major religions -- demand from those who lead our nation: a real commitment to the least among us.READ POST | comments (23)02.05.2006 Fred BranfmanNo President in American history has so misused his Executive Power to so weaken national security and so endanger his people.READ POST | comments (21)02.05.2006 Miles MogulescuBush wants the public to see warrantless wiretapping as an issue of security versus weakness.
