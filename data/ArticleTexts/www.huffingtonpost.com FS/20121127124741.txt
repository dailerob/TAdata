{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027At this point almost everyone has heard of Nate Silver, the New York Times polling analyst who had all the pundits looking stupid on election night. Silver managed to call every state exactly right. He ignored the gibberish about momentum or voters\u0027 moods and simply focused on the data given by the various polls taken in the final weeks of the campaign. Unfortunately, there is no one like Silver in the budget debates who can force the participants to look at logic and evidence. For the foreseeable future the budget debate will be dominated by the Karl Roves of both political parties. This is too bad, because the Karl Roves in the budget debate don\u0027t just want to mislead us about Governor Romney\u0027s election prospects; they want to take away our Social Security and Medicare.Read Post | Comments (158)Jedediah Purdy, 11/26/12Professor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027The change that\u0027s happening is not just demographic.

It\u0027s that it has always been everyone\u0027s country, and that fact is harder and harder for anyone to deny.Read Post | Comments (285)Ann Brenoff, 11/26/12Senior Writer, The Huffington PostThere is no time of greater expectations -- or disappointment when those expectations aren\u0027t met -- than the holidays. It\u0027s a period when every blemish of your life comes under a magnifying glass: Your imperfect marriage, your imperfect children are all there rearing their ugly imperfect heads.Read Post | Comments (68)Russell Simmons, 11/26/12Founder, GlobalGrind.comMr. President, I am deeply concerned about the future of urban America, specifically the plight of people of color.

The impulse to make Lincoln absolutely heterosexual reflects a discernible societal discomfort with the complexities of human sexuality.Read Post | Comments (256)David Fontana, 11/26/12Associate Professor of Law at George Washington University School of Law in Washington, D.C.It is time for the administration to create nomination hearings that have more human drama and less legal theory. It is conventional wisdom in the social sciences that people respond more to stories that feature identifiable victims or heroes.Read Post | CommentsShelly Palmer, 11/26/12Host, Shelly Palmer Digital LivingThe iPad Mini is a winner.
