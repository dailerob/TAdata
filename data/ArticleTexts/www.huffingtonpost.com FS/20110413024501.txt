{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"America has been a nation at war for nearly a decade -- longer than any time in our history. But because the fighting is being done by a tiny percentage of our citizens -- all of whom volunteered -- it\u0027s been far too easy to keep their struggles at arm\u0027s length. And it\u0027s even easier to forget about the hardships endured by the families they leave behind. That\u0027s why we are making this Military Families Week at The AOL Huffington Post Media Group -- and why all week our many sections will focus on the issues that most impact military families. The goal is to honor these families, remind us of their sacrifices, provide them with employment resources, and let our readers know the practical steps the rest of us can take to help them. Click here to learn more, and let\u0027s all make a difference.Read Post | CommentsHoward Fineman, 04.12.2011Editorial Director, Huffington Post Media GroupIf President Obama thinks Medicare is essential to our Union, he had better make the case convincingly tomorrow.
