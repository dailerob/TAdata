{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Sanders and Clinton have criticized each other for raising some taxes on the non-rich, but this criticism is misplaced. There are taxes that are good and necessary policy, even they fall partly on the middle class. Examples are payroll taxes that finance Social Security and Medicare, taxes on tobacco that deter tobacco consumption and taxes on carbon. The issue is not whether taxes should ever be levied on the non-rich. Rather, the question is offsets and benefits. High taxes on sugary drinks and on tobacco make sense to deter unhealthy consumption. If they fall heavily on the working class, that impact can be offset with other benefits. Higher payroll taxes to finance universal health insurance make sense, because the result over time will be lower costs and a more efficient system. That said, not everything in Sanders\u0027 program makes good sense as tax policy. But the idea of a big and long overdue increase in public outlay deserves mainstream consideration.The fact is that the use of guns in self-defense in America bears little resemblance to the false claims made by the NRA and its gun industry partners.

None.Public speaker, activist, OlympianLemonade speaks to generations -- mothers to daughters, grandmothers to granddaughters.
