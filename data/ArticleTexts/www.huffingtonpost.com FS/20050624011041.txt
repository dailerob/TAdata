{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AriannaRemember when it was fun to watch Don Rumsfeld come out and do his preening Master of the Universe act? Actually, I never thought it was that fun -- and I was always surprised by how much the self-loathing press loved Rummy’s cocky cutesy little putdowns and the jabberwocky nonsense answers he’d use to duck a question without uttering a single word of substance. But he intimidated them, humiliated them, and so they subserviently accepted their role in the kabuki theater performances his appearances became. But with two to three soldiers and dozens of Iraqis dying each and every day, his smug verbal pirouettes are no longer so endearing.There he was at today’s Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, spinning and spinning. But no one’s laughing anymore.It’s now beyond dispute that the enemy Rumsfeld is most suited to fight is the latest straw enemy he has created in his mind. Tragically, we’ve got a real enemy to fight, and Rumsfeld is clueless about how to do it. It’s time to pull the plug on the Rummy dog and pony show. Or, better yet, move his all-too-real reality show from the Pentagon to Fox -- where the body count will be significantly lower.Read More.06.23.2005 Tom HaydenIs anyone else disappointed with Al Franken\u0027s daily defense of the continued war in Iraq? Not Bush\u0027s version of the war, because that would undermine Air America\u0027s laudable purpose of rallying an anti-Bush audience. But, well, Kerry\u0027s version of the war, one that can be better managed and won, somehow with better body armor and fewer torture cells. This morning Franken was endorsing Sen. Joe Biden\u0027s proposal to send 5,000 NATO troops to close the Syrian-Iraq border, bring in foreign trainers for the Iraqi officer corps, and put Iraqis to work cleaning up the destruction of our invasion. \"Last chance to get it right.\"read whole post | permalink | comments06.23.2005 Jerry and Joe LongAt a fund-raiser for the Conservative Party of New York State, Karl Rove said, \"Al Jazeera now broadcasts the words of Senator Durbin to the Mideast, certainly putting our troops in greater danger. No more needs to be said about the motives of liberals.\" Yes, the executives at Al Jazeera, having no visuals or video of torture or civilian casualties, were pacing the office while feverishly checking their C-Span feed for something, anything to incite the Muslim world. Then Durbin took the Senate floor as an aide placed a giant sign behind him reading - “Endangering Our Troops: The Liberal Plan For Aiding And Comforting Evil.\"read whole post | permalink | comments06.23.2005 Patt MorrisonCheck the catalogues, sign on to eBay –- what isn’t being hawked with a flag on it? Doormats, handkerchiefs, cocktail napkins, pocket knives, sheets, wastebaskets, dog shirts, chip-and-dip sets, bras, toilet seat covers. You can blow your nose on the flag, sop up your booze with it, sleep on it, stab someone with it, dress your dog in it, dump your trash in it, flush away under it and wipe your feet on it – but don’t even think about setting fire to it.read whole post | permalink | comments06.23.2005 Harry ShearerLONDON--Once you get past the crime stories, and Tony Blair\u0027s challenge to the EU of which he\u0027s about to become the next rotating president, you get to today\u0027s big story, broken by, of all publications, the normally not-to-be-spoken-of-in-polite-company Sun. Owned by Rupert Murdoch, claiming a circulation in the zillions, the Sun today reports that private banking information of Brits is being sold by someone or someones in India, where banking call center jobs have been outsourced.read whole post | permalink | comments06.23.2005 Nellie BOK, the media on all sides of the political/corporate spectrum agree that the armed forces have a serious recruitment problem. But the MSM are largely ignoring another even more obvious angle, which has been simmering for weeks in the blogosphere: appeal directly to the war\u0027s supporters to help make up the shortfall. Steve Gilliard at the News Blog says, \"What I want people to do is be honest. If you will not serve in Iraq, and no one you know will serve, stop expecting someone else to do what you will not.\"read whole post | permalink | comments06.22.2005 Seth GreenlandI know that if I\u0027m a guy with a son in Iraq, helping out a parent who worked for a company where the pension fund went south, and whose daughter can\u0027t get a decent education, flag burning it what I think about when I wake up each day, and I\u0027m glad Congress shares my priorities. But what I really want to know, if I\u0027m that guy, is when our elected represenatives are going to have more hearings on steroid abuse in professional baseball.read whole post | permalink | comments06.23.2005 Trey EllisI just got home from seeing Crash, one of the most frustrating films I’ve ever seen. I left the theater fuming to my friend that race relations are so much more layered and dense than anything shrieked by any of the characters in that film. Then I drove back home, the top down, through a warm, moonlit night, LA’s lights twinkling not unlike those of the Los Angeles in the film. A man was running down the middle of my narrow street screaming, “Help! Help!” Was this some sort of odd scam? Was a well-dressed Spaniard trying to carjack my gorgeous 1973 Mustang Mach I convertible? Carjackings feature prominently in Crash and this coincidence was just too weird...read whole post | permalink | comments06.23.2005 Jay GordonMercury in vaccines causes autism and other brain injury. This week, ABC TV (my old employer) twisted the editing and commentary to weaken Robert F. Kennedy Jr\u0027s interview on the subject. For ABC TV, hundreds of millions of dollars in ad revenue are at stake and they were irresponsible with the lives and health of children at risk. They should be ashamed of themselves.read whole post | permalink | comments06.22.2005 Alex KeyssarOn June 12, Howard Dean endorsed the right to vote amendment sponsored by Congressman Jackson. The reporters\u0027 questions afterward focused obsessively on the comments that Dean had made a few days earlier disparaging some Republicans. What the press wanted to cover was not an important substantive issue but a spitting contest between political personalities: e.g. would Dean respond to criticism that vice president Cheney had voiced that morning? Not a single question was asked about the meaning or significance of the amendment itself.read whole post | permalink | comments06.22.2005 Stephanie SandbergI woke up this morning and recognized again my unavoidable membership in the liberal media elite. I mention it because last Sunday’s New York Times Magazine cover story on the Maryland movement to outlaw gay marriage forced me to peer outside my little world of privilege into the face of fear and loathing, disguised as Christian compassion. In sum: the anti-gay-marriage activists in the Times story say they are galvanized by fear of contagion. Allow two men to marry today, and tomorrow: team bestiality.read whole post | permalink | comments06.22.2005 Charlie CrayWhether the oil revenues-for-Halliburton investigation will lead all the way to Cheney himself is anyone\u0027s guess. But one twist that the intrepid reporters and congressional investigators interested in \"following the money\" back to the original decision to give Halliburton/KBR the no-bid contract paid for out of the DFI, is that at some point they are likely to end up knocking on the door of former Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz who, as the current president of the World Bank sits on the international advisory monitoring board (IAMB) charged with overseeing the DFI, an obvious conflict of interest.read whole post | permalink | comments06.23.2005 Eric BoehlertEsquire\u0027s fawning Rummy feature, which runs 7,700 words in the July issue and studiously avoids any unpleasantness, is certainly suitable for Pentagon framing...read whole post | permalink | comments06.23.2005 Tom WatsonLennon: The Musical.

The only case supporters of true justice can celebrate happened over forty years ago with the long-overdue conviction of Edgar Ray Killen for manslaughter in the killings of civil rights activists Goodman, Chaney, and Schwerner. Forty years ago. And here\u0027s the worst, the guy was in a wheelchair with an oxygen tube up his nose. It\u0027s no fun to put guys in wheelchairs in jail even when they\u0027re guilty racists.

The superintendent, a lieutenant general, was asked how long it would take to restore religious tolerance at the Academy. He replied gloomily, “If everything goes well, it’s probably going to take six years to fix it.” Meanwhile the scandal of evangelical proselytizing at a government institution and at public expense has generated, not outrage, but lethargic indifference, with few exceptions, on the part of the media and the Department of Defense.read whole post | permalink | comments","h1":"",".title":"","h2":"Rove Uses 9/11 In Face Of Declining Polls...Pulling the Plug on Rumsfeld’s Tired ActAl Franken, liberal hawk?Karl \u0026 UsCongress Fiddles While Flags Don\u0027t Get BurnedIdentity Theft, Bangalore StyleThe Elephant in the RoomBurn ThisMy Own CrashNo Conflict of InterestMainstream News Media and the Right to VoteGirl in a Bubble\"Follow the Money\"Suitable for Pentagon FramingNothing Is RealChristian Extremists in IraqShow Trials?ASK SADDAMLIve 8 /Bob Geldof - White Band DayAnd Justish for AllWhat in God\u0027s Name Is Going on at the Air Force Academy?","h3":"BlogsBreaking NewsU.S. NewspapersInternational NewspapersTelevision NewsInternational News NetworksNews Search Engines",".snippet":"","h4":"U.S. Doled Out $12 Billion In Cash In Iraq...Evangelicals Head To Iraq, Looking For Christian, Muslim Converts ...Former RNC Chairman Elected To Run Public Broadcasting ...Douse Mag In Male Sweat And It\u0027s A Bestseller ...Microsoft, BK Launch \u0027Viral\u0027 Ad Campagins Using New Messenger ...
