It kicked off with the Mad Men finale, which ended [SPOILER ALERT] with Don Draper meditating on a hilltop, just before we see the famous, \"I\u0027d like to teach the world to sing,\" Coke ad from 1971. Did Don create it? The series is over, but the debate lives on. Next, David Letterman -- after 33 years of smart, stupid, silly, absurd, cool, game-changing comedy -- signed off with a pitch-perfect finale, and a sincere, \"Thank you and goodnight.\" Less bittersweet was Jeb Bush continuing to say goodbye to his senses, following up his Iraq debacle by claiming that it\u0027s \"arrogant\" to say there\u0027s a scientific consensus that climate change is man-made. No, what\u0027s truly arrogant is denying future generations a livable planet. Continue down this road, and the earth will say goodbye to us all. Now there\u0027s an unambiguous finale.After Johnny Carson left, it was difficult to imagine that someone fresh would appear on late night TV until David Letterman came along. Other shows and hosts had their moments. But Letterman seemed indefatigable and slightly nuts. Some of it didn\u0027t work.

I have a few.Award-winning journalist, bestselling author and activistLegislation moving forward in the House of Representatives would further weaken the regulation of derivatives conducted through foreign subsidiaries of Wall Street banks - which could constitute the majority of Wall Street derivatives transactions.Chairman, Financial Crisis Inquiry CommissionA sea of fear divides Europeans from migrants. Migrants fear death on the sea. For Europeans, there was, and still is, the fear of accommodating, of sharing. There\u0027s a lack of courage in not putting these people -- who have risked their lives -- first.Ambassador to Italy of the partnership between Save the Children and Bulgari.If the President and the Republicans believe these draft agreements are so good, and therefore merit fast track, let them make the agreements public, so that the public could say a resounding NO to ISDS and other threats to the common interest hidden within the draft agreements.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia UniversityThe State of Oregon prohibits its fishermen from using these deadly nets -- leaving California as the only West Coast state still allowing fishermen to use them.ActressCEO, OceanaConvince your government that the real threat, as Lincoln knew, comes from within. Governments always forget that, too. Do not let your government outsource honesty, transparency or candor. Do not let your government outsource democracy.Documentary FilmmakerWe may think we\u0027re teaching safety when we tell them to disregard the unfamiliar, when we tell them to turn away from strangers, but what we\u0027re teaching is intolerance and indifference.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarA disturbing trend is sweeping across American colleges and universities under the guise of protecting students from allegedly offensive speech -- defined differently by different interest groups -- with demands for everything from \"trigger warnings\" to banning speakers from campus.Founding publisher, Skeptic magazine; editor, Skeptic.comThis is not \"free trade.\" This is the race to the bottom. While we must help poor people around the world improve their standard of living, we can do that without destroying the American middle class.Independent U.S. Senator from VermontI periodically hear questions or comments that remind me going to therapy is not as normalized or as acceptable as I had hoped. So in an attempt to shed light on the truth about seeing a therapist and raise awareness, here is a list of 14 things you shouldn\u0027t assume about people who go to therapy.Lifestyle Blog Editor, The Huffington PostWhen we talk about all of the problems we have on Earth and the need to solve them, it is only through such AI-human collaboration that we will gain the ability to solve our grandest challenges and truly create a world of abundance.Chairman/CEO, XPRIZEThey say timing is everything in life. Well, if that\u0027s true, the timing of this legislation to approve fast-track trade authority could not be worse for middle-class families.Senior Member of the Senate Foreign Relations CommitteeEcosystems provide for a plethora of human needs, from nutritious food, to timber, fiber and fuel. Yet, over the past 50 years, humans have degraded ecosystems more rapidly than in any comparable period in history.CEO, UnileverBrazilian business and social entrepreneur, member of the Board of Directors and one of the founders of Natura CosméticosMy Facebook feed is filled with photos of smiling college graduates. If you want to share some real advice with the graduates in your life, try these tidbits. Here\u0027s what nobody told me at my graduation 40 years ago that I wished they had.Senior Writer/Columnist, The Huffington PostIn the early evening of May 20 the words \"used to be\" will be grafted to the end of my name. I will be referred to as \"the former director\" of Late Show With David Letterman. Along with the name change, comes the surrender of an all-access pass to New York City.Late Show with David Letterman, Director and Supervising ProducerThe \u0027dumbing down\u0027 comment came off as a huge generalisation by an A-grade asshorn. I did not mean that science fiction or fantasy are dumb, far from it. How could I say that? In the words of Han Solo, \"Hey, it\u0027s me!\" In the last two weeks, I have seen two brilliant exponents of the genre. Ex Machina and Mad Max: Fury Road, both of which had my head spinning in different and wonderful ways and are both very grown up films...Actor/writerYour longtime love sees you through a filter of loving timelessness. They know that your soft tummy was caused by growing their babies, the lines by your eyes the product of shared laughs. To be middle-aged and single can be rather awkward, especially if you can\u0027t laugh about it.Author, contributing editor for Runner\u0027s World magazine, Runner, MotherA clear majority -- two thirds -- of Americans don\u0027t have guns in their homes. Almost four out of five Americans don\u0027t personally own a gun. And as the gun-owning population continues to age and die off, fewer Americans are taking their place. These numbers terrify the NRA and their \"corporate partners\" in the gun industry but should offer hope for the majority of Americans.Executive Director, Violence Policy CenterDuring the 2010 campaign for governor, Scott Walker famously promised to create 250,000 jobs in his first term. Toward this end, one of his first acts as governor was to privatize the state\u0027s economic development agency.The Center for Media and Democracy/ALEC ExposedWelcome news this week from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.

And I judged myself for it.Relationship Sensei, Mom Butler, Wife Dominatrix, Slightly MustachioedI thought it might be spiritually helpful to compare Fox\u0027s language about the poor to the language of Christ, both in substance and tone, and the deep feelings that these completely contrary languages, and their comparison, reveals.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersIt is unfortunate that the world, particularly India, has not come together on the issue of poverty as it has on climate change. The two are interlinked. Therefore, I would urge India to keep in mind two questions when formulating the country\u0027s INDCs. Do our INDCs reflect our commitment to reduce carbon emissions with a view toward reducing poverty?Pioneer in women’s empowerment and grassroots development in India; founder of the Self-Employed Women’s Association and the Cooperative Bank of SEWAChildren who come into foster care often have been exposed to multiple traumatic events including the removal from their families, and may be at higher risk for mental health problems and emotional disorders.
