{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Political Editor, The Huffington PostMany who listened to President Obama\u0027s account of yesterday\u0027s meeting with Republicans believed there was hope for a bipartisan conclusion to the lame duck Congress. What planet do he and they think they\u0027re on? Obama and his crew have many good qualities, but that list does not include skill and guts at legislative combat with Republicans. The GOP is energized and out for blood. And, like all tough politicians, when they sense weakness on the other side, they are emboldened to press harder.Read Post | CommentsBob Cesca, 12.01.2010Host of the Bob and Elvis ShowThe president looks weaker than at any other time in his presidency. He\u0027s completely off the rails, following rules that no longer exist, and well beyond any notion of post-partisanship.Read Post | CommentsRobert Reich, 12.01.2010Fmr. Secretary of Labor; Professor at Berkeley; Author, Aftershock: \u0027The Next Economy and America\u0027s Future\u0027Unless the President and Democrats explain why the economy still stinks for most Americans and offer a plan to fix it, the Republican explanation and solution -- it\u0027s big government\u0027s fault, and all we need do is shrink it -- will prevail.Read Post | CommentsKeli Goff, 12.01.2010Author, commentator and contributor to TheLoop21.comThe bigger concern to those of you who fear a Palin presidency should be who would actually end up serving out most of her term, and the fact that the copilot she selects could do more to position her than anything else.Read Post | CommentsTed Danson, 12.01.2010Actor; Board Member at OceanaI haven\u0027t heard news this good in a long time. The Obama administration\u0027s announcement to protect the Eastern Gulf of Mexico and both coasts from offshore drilling is a massive win for our oceans and every living thing that relies on them.Read Post | CommentsArianna Huffington, 11.30.2010The cables released by WikiLeaks provide another opportunity to turn the spotlight on the war in Afghanistan. They are a powerful reminder of what this unwinnable war is costing us in terms of lives, money and our long-term national security.Read Post | CommentsKathleen Reardon, 12.01.2010Professor, USC Marshall School, and author of \u0027Comebacks at Work\u0027The Republican Party has staked out a position where anything to the left of extreme selfishness is on the slippery slope to socialism. But it hasn\u0027t occurred to Democrats to counter with the more real scenario of creeping aristocracy.Read Post | CommentsAndy Borowitz, 12.01.2010Comedian and creator of BorowitzReport.comThe Interpol chief said that Mr. Assange\u0027s inclusion on Interpol\u0027s \"Most Wanted\" list was an understatement: \"We don\u0027t just want him -- we need him. Badly. Merde!\"Read Post | CommentsRichard (RJ) Eskow, 12.01.2010Consultant, Writer, Senior Fellow with The Campaign for America\u0027s FutureWe\u0027re being told the final draft of the proposal is fairer than its predecessor. It\u0027s nothing of the kind. In many ways it\u0027s worse than the draft that preceded it, and those much-lauded \"compromises\" evaporate in the cold light of reality.Read Post | CommentsArt Brodsky, 12.01.2010Communications Director, Public KnowledgeThe FCC has spent the past nine months dancing around key issues, trying to find a way to please the big carriers and their in-house politicians, rather than trying to be forthright with the correct policy that would most benefit the economy.Read Post | CommentsRev. Jesse Jackson, 12.01.2010Civil rights activistOne in seven people were impoverished in 2009 -- the highest number since the Census Bureau started keeping track 51 years ago. Yet poverty and disparity are unmentionable in our nation\u0027s capital.Read Post | CommentsChris Weigant, 12.01.2010Author, Political Commentator, and Blogger (ChrisWeigant.com)Obama just had his most stable month ever in the public opinion polls, capping off a remarkable year of polling stability. Were you to just read the headlines or listen to the soundbites, you may have a different impression.Read Post | CommentsSec. Hilda Solis, 12.01.2010U.S. Secretary of LaborThe DREAM Act would strengthen our economy and our work force. It would strengthen our national defense and our national security. With bipartisan support, it\u0027s time to make it a reality.Read Post | CommentsSheila C. Johnson, 12.01.2010Entrepreneur, Philanthropist, FilmmakerAIDS in America doesn\u0027t appear on the media\u0027s radar screen like it once did. The subject no longer commands the headlines it deserves. That\u0027s why I made a film to shed light on the issue.Read Post | CommentsJosh Silver, 12.01.2010President, Free PressThis morning, FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski announced that he will finally seek a vote on President Obama\u0027s top tech issue, \"Net Neutrality.\" However, his proposal is nowhere close to what Obama promised the American people.Read Post | CommentsAzeem Ibrahim, 12.01.2010Research Fellow, Harvard Kennedy School’s International Security ProgramThe new WikiLeaks cables provides more evidence of government corruption in Afghanistan.

The fact is that nuclear weapons, in anybody\u0027s hands, are an existential threat to humanity.Read Post | CommentsJulius Genachowski, 12.01.2010Chairman, Federal Communications CommissionWe must take action to protect consumers against price hikes and closed access to the Internet -- and our proposed framework is designed to do just that.Read Post | CommentsMónica Villamizar, 11.30.2010Correspondent, Al Jazeera English\"It\u0027s worse than Iraq here.\" I heard this phrase repeatedly while reporting in the Complexo d\u0027Alemao favela.Read Post | CommentsEric Villency, 12.01.2010Principal of the Villency Design GroupThe holidays are here and along with it comes the classic dilemma -- what to get the men in your life?Read Post | CommentsPhil Bronstein, 12.01.2010Executive Vice President and Editor-at-Large, San Francisco ChronicleThe more the WikiLeaks info is made public, the more people absorb it into their understanding of how things works. And the less power it will have. The back fence chatter and double-dealing will go on as it always has.Read Post | CommentsDan Collins, 12.01.2010New York Editor-At-Large of The Huffington PostThe 9/11 health bill faces a vote in the Senate. Democratic backers are one Republican vote short of passage.Read Post | CommentsKatherine Marshall, 12.01.2010Senior Fellow, Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs at Georgetown UniversityGideon Byamugisha, an Anglican priest, learned that he was HIV positive in 1991.

Wilson, 12.01.2010Political Science Professor, University of DelawareThe military operates by emphasizing a \"team\" identity, and this is why concerns about the repeal of \"Don\u0027t Ask, Don\u0027t Tell\" are irrelevant. You sign away your own beliefs when you join and adopt those regulated by the service.Read Post | CommentsRobert Lenzner, 12.01.2010Forbes columnistLast night at a Common Cause dinner in New York, Paul Volcker singled out the danger facing the U.S. if the dollar no longer retains its role as a global benchmark.Read Post | CommentsJennie Nash, 2010.12.01Keli Goff, 2010.12.01Andy Borowitz, 2010.12.01David Isenberg, 2010.12.01Jim Worth, 2010.12.01Shaneika Dabney, 2010.12.01Rick Carnes, 2010.12.01Bob Cesca, 2010.12.01Frank Sesno, 2010.12.01Lloyd Chapman, 2010.12.01","h1":"Using a mobile device?
