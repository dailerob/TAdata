{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editorial Director, AOL Huffington Post Media GroupIf conventions are important anymore, and I\u0027m not sure they are, they matter for what is not said more than what is said. The strategic and factual silences show indirectly what the party, candidate and campaign regard as their vulnerabilities -- the people, issues and themes that they know will drive away what\u0027s left of the undecided vote. As the Republican National Convention comes to a close, I\u0027m sitting here in the hall compiling a list of the unstated. One is Romneycare. Even though Mitt brags about it selectively on the campaign trail, his health care program in Massachusetts has not received a mention here. The reason is obvious: He\u0027s running against Obamacare, which was modeled on his own.Read Post | Comments (454)Jared Bernstein, 08/30/12Senior Fellow, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesFollowing Paul Ryan\u0027s acceptance speech last night, the fact checkers and many in the media have been working hard to correct the many falsehoods. It show\u0027s we\u0027re deep into the post-truth era.Read Post | Comments (88)Leo W. Gerard, 08/30/12International President, United SteelworkersWay before the 2010 Citizens United ruling, 1 percenters were working on a takeover. If the 99 percent don\u0027t stop them soon, don\u0027t establish some sort of separation of wealth and state, then the nation will lose its founding precepts.Read Post | Comments (319)Cenk Uygur, 08/30/12Host, \u0027The Young Turks\u0027One of the reasons this Republican convention has been so dull is that the real action isn\u0027t at the convention. It\u0027s at Cracker Bay. That\u0027s the name of the yacht where the Romney team just hosted top donors.Read Post | Comments (168)Arianna Huffington, 08/30/12Yesterday\u0027s job creation panel discussion put the spotlight on what Tom Brokaw called \"the most critical grassroots issue in America today.\" In an effort to shift the narrative away from a fatalistic acceptance of the jobs crisis, the panelists focused on what is working when it comes to job creation. As the Rockefeller Foundation\u0027s Judith Rodin put it, \"The innovative spirit of American communities is alive and well.\"Read Post | Comments (60)Marlo Thomas, 08/30/12Award-winning actress, author, and activistSummer Wilson couldn\u0027t believe her eyes when her mother handed her a journal written more than 15 years ago -- a diary that she never even knew existed. As she leafed through its pages, it quickly became apparent that the journal was all about her and how she almost died.Read Post | CommentsBilly Corriher and Andrew Blotky, 08/30/12Judges are supposed to be independent, fair arbiters of justice. In the Citizens United era, however, judges will increasingly face a choice between the law and special interests that can spend unlimited sums on their re-elections.Read Post | Comments (11)Cheech Marin, 08/29/12Actor/Comedian/Activist/Art CollectorOk, Let\u0027s pretend that the Latino population explosion is not going to happen (heh, heh, heh, at least try it) and go back to the \"English Only\" issue. If this is the situation, then we are going to have to re-name most of our states.Read Post | Comments (478)Bill Moyers and Bernard Weisberger, 08/30/12No serious proposal to take the money out of politics, or even reduce its tightening grip on the body politic, will emerge from Tampa or Charlotte, so the sounds of celebration and merriment are merely prelude to a funeral cortege for America as a shared experience.Read Post | Comments (547)Paul Clolery, 08/30/12Vice President and Editorial Director of NPT Publishing GroupThe national discussion needs to be about people and jobs, not taxes. The nation\u0027s charitable sector gets it. The sector is about people and transforming lives.Read Post | CommentsJosh Silver, 08/30/12CEO, United RepublicBehind the pomp and circumstance of the conventions, you\u0027ll quickly discover unthinkable largess bestowed upon Republicans and Democrats alike in exchange for policies that are screwing just about everyone who doesn\u0027t happen to have a well-heeled lobbyist or Super PAC.Read Post | Comments (88)Mark Hertsgaard, 08/30/12Author, \u0027Hot: Living Through the Next Fifty Years on Earth\u0027Shading the truth is one thing; Politicians of all stripes do that all the time. But Ryan\u0027s speech to the Republican faithful on Wednesday night abused truth so often and so shamelessly that even some mainstream media voices took notice in their post-speech coverage.Read Post | Comments (57)Gregory Beyer, 08/30/12Senior Editor, The Huffington PostAs Romney approaches the lectern to the sound of deafening applause, the convention\u0027s sound system will blast \"God Bless America,\" in an attempt to rouse the candidate\u0027s spirits. After Romney has settled behind the lectern, he will be shot with a riot-control water cannon.Read Post | CommentsD.L.

But there is much more heat than light, and our country seems more polarized than ever.Read Post | Comments (108)J. Mijin Cha, 08/30/12Senior Policy Analyst, D?mosKeystone XL\u0027s job creation number and the idea that fracking creates great, local jobs are myths. But not only does money talk, it makes policy. In 2011, the oil and gas lobby spent nearly $150 million on lobbying.Read Post | Comments (89)Steven Strauss, 08/30/12Advanced Leadership Fellow, Harvard UniversityWe live in an age of rapid change.

Apparently, you can lie freely now. I decided to talk to Dr. R.H. Flutes, head of the Lying Institute of America, to explain the lying epidemic sweeping this country.Read Post | Comments (57)Marty Kaplan, 08/30/12Director, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolNews producers are afraid that indefatigable fact checking of either party will bore the pants off people. But I don\u0027t smell any fear of ennui emanating from station owners making billions off broadcasting the Big Lie.Read Post | Comments (77)Blair Bowie, 08/30/12Democracy Advocate, U.S. PIRGThe sad truth is that both parties are so focused on raising enough cash to win in a post-Citizens United world that they\u0027re unlikely to take a serious look at ways to change the playing field.Read Post | CommentsLucas Kavner, 08/30/12Culture Reporter, Huffington PostIn a recent interview, Mitt Romney said cutting all federal funding for the National Endowment for the Arts, PBS, and NPR would be a \"focus\" of his administration.Read Post | Comments (213)Tamar Haspel, 08/30/12Ex-urbanite now knee-deep in chicken poop: starvingofftheland.comThe destruction of topsoil, the reliance on monocrops, and the web of subsidies for corn and soy are indefensible.
