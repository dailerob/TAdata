The bluefin is on a path to endangerment. And so we wait.Read Post | CommentsArianna Huffington, 05.30.2011This weekend, I learned of squirrels whose behavior offers scientific proof of the evolutionary basis of altruism. It was a lesson especially worth remembering on a weekend devoted to recalling the sacrifice of those who have given their lives in defense of ours.Read Post | CommentsBryce Covert, 05.31.2011Assistant Editor, New Deal 2.0Credit scores are becoming more and more important, but who is in charge of these scores and how are they determined?

But protecting life takes precedent over respecting a will that is not free but distorted by mental and often genetic, chemical or other malfunctions.Read Post | CommentsKathryn M. Ireland, 05.31.2011Finally the show is here! Million Dollar Decorators... if only I had taken Margaret Russell\u0027s advice and insisted on hair and makeup, not to mention losing 15 pounds before the show was taped instead of after, I would have no negative comments.Read Post | CommentsMichael Shaw, 05.31.2011Publisher of the visual politics and photojournalism site, BagNewsNotesInstead of glamorizing Sarah Palin with Cover Girl photos, what if the media published photos of Team Palin as the flimflam they really are?Read Post | CommentsDavid Bromwich, 05.30.2011Professor of Literature at YaleThe tone of the present administration is more soothing than that of its predecessor.

Was bin Laden\u0027s killing legal? Were those \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" legal? These questions are irrelevant.

Roger Denson, 05.31.2011Critic, essayist and cultural nomadEminently lyrical and rapturous in the cinematic manifold that it kaleidoscopically brings into and out of focus onscreen with each turn of the Terrence Malick lens, Tree of Life is one of those singular cinematic milestones.Read Post | CommentsSam Harris, 05.30.2011Author, NeuroscientistThe concept of free will is a non-starter, both philosophically and scientifically.
