{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Obama now supports an increase in the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. That\u0027s great, but as the rest of his SOTU speech will make all too clear, Congress is not about to pass this overdue legislation, or anything else Obama proposes. President Obama has the power to make a practical difference in the lives of millions of workers and their families. He should declare bluntly that he aims to use that power, and dare Republicans to say that these workers are overpaid. White House strategists have noticed the power of state level ballot initiatives on higher minimum wages, paid sick leave, and other issues that speak directly to the pocketbook needs of working families. Measures like these can raise turnout among base Democratic voters, and even bring over some Republicans and independents.Comments (122)Farai ChideyaJournalist and authorComments (16)Babs NicholsEnglish teacher, Broughton High SchoolDespite popular rhetoric, public schools are not \"failing.\" In fact, in most ways they are succeeding. I stay because what I\u0027ve learned in 29 years is that my job is one of the ones that matters most.CommentsJohn KerryU.S. Secretary of StateHolocaust Remembrance Day calls us to condemn anti-Semitism in every form -- whether it\u0027s the disturbing rise of xenophobic and anti-Semitic parties in Europe or the uptick of violence against Jewish people anywhere in the world.CommentsDean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027The question is whether President Obama is prepared to talk about inequality in a way that gets to the core of the problem as opposed to just clipping away at the edges. It\u0027s a safe bet that we will see the latter.CommentsSen. Barbara BoxerU.S. Senator from California; Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works CommitteeWhat century are you living in? Your \"No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act\" is a solution in search of a problem. Despite your attempts to confuse people with the bill\u0027s misleading title, federal funds cannot be used for abortion under the Affordable Care Act.Comments (134)George LakoffAuthor, The Political Mind, Moral Politics and Don\u0027t Think of an Elephant!We know he\u0027s going to talk about economic inequality, as he should. He will probably mention worker salaries, which haven\u0027t risen in 30 years. But he needs to state a simple truth: Workers are Profit Creators!Comments (16)Bill DeSmedtKnowledge engineer, philosophical dilletante, and author of the cult classic science thriller SingularityThe \"Genius of Dogs\" is all the rage these days. But do dogs have actual genius? As to that, I offer in evidence the lowly (pun intended) dachshund.CommentsMark Ruffalo and Wenonah HauterIn previous years, President Obama has used his platform to promote his \"all of the above\" energy plan, which includes significantly expanding domestic oil and gas production -- i.e. fracking -- thus betraying the promises he articulated in his nomination speech at the 2008 DNC.CommentsJeffrey Ann GoudieFreelance writerThis bizarre scenario wasn\u0027t church, this was state -- or at least the Statehouse -- and the constitution that is revered by social conservatives is very firm on the separation of the two. That separation has gone the way of the Passenger Pigeon in Kansas.CommentsChristine PelosiChair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusPresident Obama commendably convened a task force to address the rampant rape and sexual assault incidents that are \"an affront to our basic decency and humanity.\" Herewith from my 20 years in advocacy for women and children are my suggestions for the council.Comments (57)Richard (RJ) EskowSenior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host, Take Action NewsIt\u0027s important to understand, or at least attempt to understand, the mental state that produces such plutocratic rage. After all, our political and economic system gives billionaires an extraordinary influence over the lives of every individual in the country. It pays to investigate their emotional makeup, if only for our societal well-being.CommentsRobert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, Beyond OutragePeople ask me all the time why we don\u0027t have a revolution in America, or at least a major wave of reform similar to that of the Progressive Era or the New Deal or the Great Society. The answer is complex, but three reasons stand out.Comments (619)Peter WattsWriter, presenter, public speakerIt\u0027s the most unenviable job in politics: delivering the response to the president\u0027s State of the Union address. A high-wire act performed over circling sharks, the number one goal is simply to avoid coming out of it as chum. To emerge merely a chump can be considered success.CommentsMatt WalshBlogger, talk radio host, father of twinsNewsflash: It\u0027s not OK to be selfish, impatient, and out of control. These traits, while common, are unacceptable. They should not be accepted, least of all by the people you claim to love. This philosophy is poison, and it stretches beyond one offensive quote from a 20th century Playboy Bunny.CommentsKevin SmithThat fat guy who got thrown off the planeI\u0027ll miss you, Jim. Thanks for shaping the last two decades of my life. Rest in peace knowing you were an absolute success and, with the exception of that one mall picture, you made some excellent, unforgettable movies.CommentsJeff JarvisAuthor, \u0027Public Parts\u0027 and \u0027What Would Google Do?\u0027In the end, I think -- I hope -- what Klein is doing is staking his ground and following a dictum I started thinking about in 2007: Do what you do best and link to the rest. What he wants to do best is explain the news and the world to the public. That\u0027s a tall order but I like the mission.CommentsDavid FontanaAssociate Professor of Law at George Washington University School of Law in Washington, D.C.If you want a compelling story about our national political life as the politics of 2014 begin--and what has been and might happen with the Republican Party--look to the North Country.CommentsJennifer DziuraCareer and life coaching advice writer at GetBullish.comMost of us talk about our sex lives with at least one person we\u0027re not having sex with. Yet many of us do not talk about money with anyone at all.CommentsRoadtrippersDiscover Your AmericaReporters are calling this house \"the Cayman Islands on the Great Plains,\" a small home in the suburbs of Cheyenne that holds a pretty wild secret.CommentsAndrey TolokonnikovFather of Pussy Riot Band MemberWith \"the money in front of them,\" Pussy Riot has disbanded as a music group in order to focus full-time on political activism in Russia.CommentsMike WeisserMike the Gun GuyMaybe I\u0027ve got it all mixed up, but I haven\u0027t seen any interviews with guys in prison who pulled out a gun and shot someone because it was the \"only\" way they could settle an argument on favorable terms.Comments (119)Leo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersThese arrangements enrich some politicians and CEOs while impoverishing everyone else. The resulting rising income inequality is deliberate, not an accidental slip of some clumsy invisible hand of the market.Comments (40)Tavis SmileyPBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti joins me tonight on PBS to preview tomorrow\u0027s State of the Union address, during which it is anticipated that President Obama will lay out plans to address poverty and income inequality as part of the 2014 legislative agenda.CommentsCarrie GoldmanAuthor, BULLIED: What Every Parent, Teacher, and Kid Needs to Know About Ending the Cycle of FearMy sisters and I were probably the only people in the country who thought it was a fantastic idea to leave Florida and fly to Minnesota in the dead of winter. The trek north meant we were heading to Grandma\u0027s house, where the center of joy was located. Endless games of cards, unlimited pieces of chocolate candy, and hours of storytelling awaited us.CommentsElizabeth KucinichPolicy Director, Center for Food SafetyThe food you eat is the biggest socio-political decision you make each day. However, conditions and treatment of animals is not only a moral issue. Animal treatment has a direct impact on the health of American consumers.CommentsOtto ScharmerSenior Lecturer, MIT; Founding chair, Presencing InstituteI just returned from the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland. I came away with three observations: mindfulness is approaching a tipping point; human energy hotspots are the real attractor; and collective sleepwalkers remain dominant.CommentsMichael BrennerSenior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghOne might think that a place that cost more than a trillion dollars, tens of thousands of casualties, killed more than 100,000 Iraqis, and sullied the good name of the United States has a claim on the nation\u0027s attention. Such a conclusion, though, misreads the psychology of a people led by the nose into misfortunate.CommentsNorman SolomonAuthor, \u0027War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death\u0027The NSA depends on huge computers that guzzle electricity in the service of the surveillance state. For the NSA\u0027s top executives, maintaining a vast flow of juice is essential -- and any interference with that flow is unthinkable. But interference isn\u0027t unthinkable. And in fact, it may be doable.CommentsAlan ColmesLiberal political commentator, host of \"The Alan Colmes Show\" on Fox News Radio, publisher of alan.com, author of \"Thank the Liberals … For Saving America\"The right wing, which has been trying to push a Benghazi \"scandal\" since before Mitt Romney blew the 2012 election, has concentrated on one phrase Hillary Clinton said during her five-hour congressional testimony. And it\u0027s a phrase they are sure to pound into the ground between now and 2016.CommentsLori J. BertmanPresident/CEO Pennington Family Foundation; Co-Founder and Chair of The Center For Disaster PhilanthropyI understand that the grief never fully goes away, but it has given me more empathy and compassion in the disaster business: Imagine this on a much greater scale where people have lost their entire communities and live with this daily.CommentsJohn Kerry, 2014.27.01H.
