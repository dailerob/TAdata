{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonWe\u0027re coming up on one of my favorite times of the year: that time, just after spring breaks out but before summer begins, in which thousands of college graduates are released into the world. And as they go forth we give them lots of advice. The advice varies, sometimes conflicts, but the general idea is: Here is what you need to know in order to succeed in the world. This year my book tour is taking me to a lot of colleges, and my first piece of advice is to start by defining success for yourself -- by being clear about what you want, what you value and what you are about. But to do that, we need to abandon, or at least mitigate, some of the worst practices of the adult world that students are already mired in: burnout, sleep deprivation, stress and anxiety. This is all the more important because this generation is starting out their adult lives burdened with multiple deficits.It boggles the mind that Shell Oil is still determined to drill in one of the most fragile and remote ecosystems on Earth: the Arctic Ocean -- the last bastion of America\u0027s polar bears, endangered bowhead whales and other rare wildlife.Robert RedfordActor, director and environmental activistIvan Lopez\u0027s killings at Fort Hood, while on a scale not often matched, are one more marker on a bloody trail of death that leads from Iraq and Afghanistan into the American heartland, to bases and backyards nationwide.Ann JonesAuthor, \u0027They Were Soldiers: How the Wounded Return From America’s Wars -- The Untold Story\u0027The truth is that the agenda of the Koch brothers is to move this country from a democratic society with a strong middle class to an oligarchic form of society in which the economic and political life of the nation are controlled by a handful of billionaire families.Sen. Bernie SandersIndependent U.S. Senator from VermontMaybe I\u0027m naïve or maybe it\u0027s because I went through years of infertility treatment but I\u0027m continually stunned at how many people ask the question, \"When are you going to have kids?\"Jennifer “Jay” PalumboWriter, Stand-Up Comic, Current Infertile, Author of the blog, ‘The 2 Week Wait,’ the Director of Patient Care at FertilityAuthority.com and a Proud IVF MomLiving every day to its fullest doesn\u0027t have to mean cramming three days worth of life into a one day bag. It doesn\u0027t have to mean living the most extraordinary, action-packed, blisteringly important day of your life. It just means a full day.Lynn Harris LeshemFmr. Executive Vice President of Production, Warner Bros.Those laws should prevent or bust up concentrations of economic power that not only harm consumers but also undermine our democracy -- such as the pending Comcast acquisition of Time-Warner.Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The prevailing fashion in nutrition, if not all of health news, is contrarianism. Cutting back on salt was yesterday\u0027s news. If today\u0027s news were the same as yesterday\u0027s news, we might not be confused, and desperately in need of tomorrow\u0027s news to help sort it all out. We can\u0027t have that!David Katz, M.D.Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterRather than using the Mimi and Nikko sex tape as a teachable moment about privacy, permanence and the longevity of Internet decisions, Harvey can\u0027t resist transforming that moment into a diatribe about shame and God\u0027s plan for women\u0027s bodies.Olivia ColePoet, author, and activistI heard myself say the words and take part in this ritual and it made me physically sick. I couldn\u0027t believe that this was the liturgy that this kind, little church had been using for the past decades, maybe longer.Paul Brandeis RaushenbushExecutive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostI would have to watch the film closely and count each and every one of Chunk\u0027s culinary escapades.Bon AppetitBon Appétit MagazineIf the story stopped with Ted Cruz, it would be only an amusing anecdote. But, unbelievably, Cruz\u0027s measure won the unanimous support of both the Senate and the House. Unanimous? There was no one willing to stand up to bullyboys Ted Cruz and his ally Charles Schumer?John FefferCo-director, Foreign Policy In FocusThere\u0027s certainly much to be said for those authors who can spellbind readers with only a few evocative words. But in an age of celebrating simplicity, are we doing too little to celebrate complexity?Claire FallonBooks Editor, The Huffington PostData visualization is one of the most important tools we have to analyze data. But it\u0027s just as easy to mislead as it is to educate using charts and graphs. Let\u0027s see how this works in practice.Ravi ParikhCo-founder of HeapOn Wednesday 16, Korean media transmitted the news about the sinking of the ferry in Jindo throughout the day. It was horrible. And the current state of Korean media is as horrible as the news.Yongjun MinFeature Editor, Elle KoreaThe phrase \"The customer is always right\" is typically used by businesses to convince customers that they will get good service at this company and convince employees to give customers good service; however, I think businesses should abandon this phrase once and for all.Alexander KjerulfSpeaker, consultant and authorAlcoholism doesn\u0027t give a shit how pretty you are, where you go to church or don\u0027t go to church, how much your mom and dad loved you as a kid, how many degrees you have. It doesn\u0027t care what kind of house you live in, what kind of car you drive, or how much money is in your bank account.Allison HudsonBlogger, www.itsalushlife.comBeyond economic aid to Ukraine and other Eastern European nations, we have identified four overarching themes that should be reinforced and reaffirmed by Congress and the administration.Michael ShankPh.D., Associate Director for Legislative Affairs, Friends Committee on National LegislationUnlike protests or even poisoned water and soil, earthquakes are shutting down fracking drills all over the world. And that\u0027s more \"earth-shattering\" than anything Harvard divestment or economic arguments can do.Carol Pierson HoldingWriter, CSRHubAt the moment, Google is hard at work to make our lives easier, more connected and rather enjoyable. This has always been a company with a proclivity towards the human touch to keep its customers smiling.Mudit KakkarEngineer, analyst, writerIf I could speak to the person who killed Angela, I would tell them that I don\u0027t have the words to say just how sad I am. I would say, \"Look what has happened to us.\"Mpho TutuIt gets better: more simple, more meaningful, more established, more fulfilling, more STABLE. You\u0027ll have fewer fights, cry less tears and make fewer bad decisions. But you\u0027ll also have less fun.Evelyn LauerChicago-based writer and teacher, working on a memoir about loveMy biggest concern about Glass is that I\u0027m not convinced it\u0027s the best form of wearable technology. I like the idea of having the Internet accessible all the time, but I\u0027m not so sure I want to be wearing a monitor on my forehead.Larry MagidTechnology journalistShe started writing as a teen and, since then, has sold more than 500 million copies of her books in more than 40 countries and had 29 best-sellers, many of which have been adapted for the big or small screens.Tavis SmileyPBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorI can see it now. The NRA annual meeting is about to kick off in Indianapolis and I\u0027ll bet you dollars to doughnuts that every speaker at the banquet and other public events will be told to say something nasty about Mike Bloomberg\u0027s new campaign to \"get rid\" of guns.Mike WeisserMike the Gun GuyThe good news is that we have an invaluable resource that can help deliver the world-class job training that prepares workers for the jobs that need to be filled: our community college system.Thomas E. PerezU.S. Secretary of LaborBecause of you, I am beginning again to believe in miracles. Because in the depth of despair over losing your beloved son you took me into your arms and guided me back onto a track where love is real, positive thinking is a choice that saves us, and miracles do happen.Kateri AllardRegistered nurseA Louisiana elected official once said \"the flag of Texaco flies over the Louisiana State Capitol.\" Right now that flag is flapping in the face of every citizen.Robert F. Kennedy Jr.President, Waterkeeper Alliance; Senior Attorney, NRDCMellie may not be a \"good\" person, but she\u0027s a fascinating, hooch and whiskey-guzzling, political badass. The beauty of watching a TV antihero is that while you may not like the fictional first lady, you\u0027ve probably found yourself cheering her on.Emma GraySenior Editor, HuffPost WomenThe surgery has sparked concerns that his better days may be behind him. Before anyone can call it quits for Manning, its best to understand the surgery he had performed and what that really means in terms of recovery.Neal M. Blitz, D.P.M., F.A.C.F.A.S.NYC Aesthetic \u0026 Reconstructive Foot SurgeonBelieve it or not, a lot more of your favorite American foods might actually be banned from being sold abroad.The Daily MealTheDailyMeal.comGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"GLITCH, PLEASE!",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
