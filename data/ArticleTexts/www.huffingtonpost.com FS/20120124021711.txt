{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Bonjour! Le Huffington Post, an international collaboration bringing together Le Monde, Les Nouvelles Éditions Indépendantes, and the Huffington Post Media Group\u0027s signature mix of news, blogging, community, and social engagement, arrives today. While we will be importing the platform, technology, and tools from across the pond, Le Huffington Post will be rooted in French culture and will reflect France\u0027s own unique personality, rich culture, and diversity of voices. And it will do so at a time when France\u0027s fortunes, challenges, and decisions are of great consequence not only to the people of France but to all of Europe and the world beyond. For me, today\u0027s launch is the culmination of a lifetime of loving France and I\u0027m delighted to invite readers in France and French speakers throughout the world -- as well as those who care about its people, issues, and rich culture -- to join the conversation.Read Post | Comments (584)Anne Sinclair, 1/23/12Editorial Director, Le Huffington PostLe Huffington Post will be a place to celebrate, debate, argue, imagine and inform.

Walberg, 1/23/12Host, PBS\u0027s \"Antiques Roadshow\"I will never be an expert on antiques.
