{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Mark GongloffChief financial writer, The Huffington PostLet\u0027s start with the very concept of Myers-Briggs personality types. These are basically zodiac signs lightly dusted with science. FDR and Richard Nixon were allegedly ENTJs, as are Whoopi Goldberg and Lex Luthor. All exactly alike, obviously. Based on a Myers-Briggs test, I am an INTP (introverted, intuitive, thinking, perceiving). But these labels don\u0027t always fit very well. Sometimes I\u0027m an introvert, sometimes I\u0027m an extrovert, depending on the situation. My type labels me as a \"rationalist\" just like Steve Jobs (though not of the money-making variety, apparently), but I am pretty much constantly irrational about everything. I therefore place about as much stock in my personality type as I do about my zodiac sign (Aquarius). Personality types are at least grounded in some reality, unlike horoscopes. But there are real practical limits to dividing all of humanity into just 16 groups, particularly when the borders of those groups are so squishy.Comments (228)David CoatesWorrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsNo matter where each of us stands on the key issues of the day, it is time for all of us to widen the debate on freedom in America. We need to move from a focus on negative freedoms to a focus on positive ones. We need to distinguish sharply between liberty and license.Comments (241)Ton EngbersenTon Engbersen is the Scientific Director of the ASTRON \u0026 IBM Center for Exascale Technology in conjunction with the DOME project.Storing 14 exabytes of data isn\u0027t economically feasible in terms of both material and energy costs. But by using cognitive computing, we can design systems that are smart about how to manage that information.CommentsBelle Beth CooperContent crafter, BufferI would love to be happier, as I\u0027m sure most people would, so I thought it would be interesting to find some ways to become a happier person that are actually backed up by science. Here are ten of the best ones I found.Comments (146)Michael ShawPublisher of the visual politics and media literacy site, BagNewsNotesIt\u0027s hard enough for society to take rape seriously when it happens to a young girl at a party. It\u0027s even harder when it\u0027s surrounded by other atrocities. ... But it\u0027s a part of our history (and present). We need to see it.Comments (45)Micah J. MurrayBlogger at RedemptionPictures.comBecause of feminism, church stages and spotlights are often dominated by women. Men are encouraged to just serve in the nursery or kitchen. Sometimes men are even told to stay silent in church.Comments (235)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Democrats are showing once again they have the backbones of banana slugs. The Affordable Care Act was meant to hold insurers to a higher standards. So it stands to reason that some insurers will have to cancel their lousy sub-standard policies.Comments (282)Brenda Della CasaAuthor, \"Cinderella Was a Liar\"; Owner \u0026 Editor-In-Chief: Staggered Magazine, Editor-In-Chief, Preston Bailey Designs; Founder \u0026 Editor-In-Chief: Life In Style www.bdclifeinstyle.comI am one of those \"welfare\" people so many people callously group into the \"lazy\" section of the room. While I am often told by these same people that I am one of the hardest working people they know, the reality is that there is no way I would be where I am today without the help I received in my past.Comments (200)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027Why is there such strident opposition when the vast majority of the country is now in favor of immigration reform? When I asked a Republican senator this question, he was surprisingly honest: \"Fear,\" he said. Fear of an American future that looks different from the present.CommentsChris WeigantPolitical writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comMost who don\u0027t really understand technology have been speaking of the Obamacare website as if it only had two possible states: \"broken\" and \"working.\" The truth is a little subtler than that. This could be a political disaster in the making -- a separate disaster than the initial rollout.CommentsMark MansonEntrepreneur, author and world travelerIf I ask you, \"What do you want out of life?\" and you say something like, \"I want to be happy and have a great family and a job I like,\" it\u0027s so ubiquitous that it doesn\u0027t even mean anything. What\u0027s more interesting to me is what pain do you want?CommentsMarty KaplanDirector, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolWithout the Benghazi drum to beat, Lindsay Graham, Darrell Issa and the shows that love them have reverted to the Obamacare apocalypse to keep us scared and watching. What\u0027s so strange is that there\u0027s an actual Armageddon in plain sight that\u0027s failing to get the red-siren treatment.Comments (61)Michael KeeganPresident, People For the American WayThe same party that shut down the government in an attempt to nullify a duly-enacted law that it does not like is now trying to prevent a twice-elected president from filling vacancies on an important court -- a duty entrusted to him by the Constitution.Comments (26)Michael RothPresident, Wesleyan UniversityAmerica has long been ambivalent about learning for its own sake, at times investing heavily in free inquiry and lifelong learning, and at other times worrying that we need more specialized training to be economically competitive.Comments (43)Jay HaizlipFounder and senior pastor, The Sanctuary; \u0027Preacher of La\u0027Anyone getting a tattoo really needs to ask themselves, why am I getting this and what is the meaning of this tattoo? Is the tattoo an expression of witchcraft, idolatry or pagan symbolism? If so, as Christians, we need to reconsider...Comments (254)Adam GrantWharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027The script is so deeply ingrained that you don\u0027t even need to think about it. When you do a favor, and someone says \"thank you,\" the automatic response is \"you\u0027re welcome.\" But according to one leading psychologist, this isn\u0027t the best choice of words.CommentsRep. Raúl M. GrijalvaCo-chair, Congressional Progressive CaucusOur recipe for prosperity is simple: protect the safety net, stop the austerity, give the economy room to grow, and don\u0027t pursue further deficit reduction at the expense of national priorities. The question is whether budget negotiators will listen.CommentsCeresEnvironmental progress is not about sacrifice for our children -- it\u0027s about opportunity for both current and future generations.CommentsAmeliaMother, wife, partner and breadwinnerMy middle son was tired, so he was nestled against my chest as I floated on my back. \"Mom,\" he said, breaking the silence, \"I want to be gay.\" This was unexpected. My middle son had never had boy crushes like my older kid, and last year he wanted to marry a female classmate.Comments (57)Wray HerbertAuthor, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027We all want kids to feel good about themselves, and far too many kids get no praise at all from adults. But are the superlatives necessary? More to the point, does lavish praise really boost kids\u0027 self-esteem and help them do well in school -- and in life?CommentsSen. Richard BlumenthalU.S. Senator from ConnecticutThe antiabortion bill introduced just days ago in the Senate -- mirroring the House\u0027s 20 week restrictions -- is a nonsensical, unconstitutional nonstarter. But it is still dangerous -- more for what it reflects in the nation than its chances of passing.CommentsKarl FleischmanKindergarten teacher, Sequoia Elementary School, Oakland, Calif.None of us can know the mind of the kid who lit a flame to Sasha\u0027s skirt, but I have a feeling that if he had seen Sasha\u0027s skirt as an expression of another kid\u0027s unique, beautiful self and had smiled and thought, \"I hella love Oakland,\" I wouldn\u0027t be writing this now.Comments (127)Mark ShriverSenior Vice President for Strategic Initiatives, Save the ChildrenChildren without access to quality early education programs start kindergarten with an 18-month disadvantage, and that gap continues to widen. By the time they are in fourth grade, many cannot do math or read at grade level. And the simple reality is that they are unlikely to catch up.Comments (13)Jordan SchultzThe Huffington Post\u0027s sports columnist, The Schultz ReportWhile the comparisons to Carmelo Anthony may be overplayed, they aren\u0027t exaggerated. Parker doesn\u0027t possess Anthony\u0027s hyper-explosive element in his own game, but he\u0027s so smart, skilled and unselfish that it doesn\u0027t matter. I would argue that he\u0027s already a better passer than Anthony, not to mention a more committed defender.CommentsAmazon Conservation TeamThis remote forest -- ringing with the sounds of frogs, monkeys and parrots --seemed surreal, as did my reason for visiting.CommentsRabbi Shmuley BoteachRabbi and WriterWhile our secular, porn-saturated culture increasingly sees men as sex-obsessed intelligent primates, I see men as intimacy-seekers, searching out a woman who can nurture their hearts, cultivate their humanity, and with whom they can achieve a sense of oneness.Comments (79)Wendell PotterAuthor, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgConsidering his very serious and costly preexisting condition, Robert was nervous as he started looking for a replacement policy. He could barely believe what he heard: he could get better coverage than the policy being discontinued -- and pay less -- thanks to Obamacare.Comments (78)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesToday, with Hawaii on the verge of becoming the 16th state to pass marriage equality, and with gays much more visible, conservative ideologues are having a harder time raising money around the marriage issue. Enter transgender rights, the newest potential cash cow for the extremist right.Comments (75)Mark BosloughPhysicist; Fellow of the Committee for Skeptical InquiryLast week, the first round of papers related to last year\u0027s spectacular asteroid explosion over Chelyabinsk, Russia, appeared. One of the most significant conclusions suggests that we may have underestimated the number of building-sized asteroids by up to a factor of 10.CommentsLauren Van HornStrategic Partnerships at Facebook; Co-founder of BushakanThis week my husband announced that he is leaving Path to start his own company with a close friend and co-worker. In Silicon Valley, an announcement like this is expected, the norm, no big deal. The thing is, it is terrifying to me.CommentsWait But Whywww.waitbutwhy.comIt\u0027s a dictatorship of the most extreme kind, a cult of personality beyond anything Stalin or Mao could have imagined, a country as closed off to the world and as secretive as they come -- a true hermit kingdom. So why would an American tourist ever be allowed into the country?Comments (273)Harris O’MalleyDating coachI did have a few breakups I would qualify with, \"I don\u0027t mean \u0027I can\u0027t be bothered to figure out where things went wrong, I mean that she was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder,\" but for the most part, \"crazy\" meant \"acting in a way I didn\u0027t like.\" I didn\u0027t realize just how damaging this attitude was in the way I related to women.Comments (302)Mike Diamond, 2013.13.11Trooper Sanders, 2013.13.11Bino A.
