So along with evoking the Cuban Missile crisis yesterday, the McCain campaign also rolled out a new round of robocalls designed to convince voters that Obama would be soft on \"sex offenders, drug dealers, and murderers.\" Unfortunately for McCain, playing the Be Afraid game has gotten a lot more complicated.

Actually, it\u0027s worse. Biopsies only take a few days, maybe a week at the most, and if the biopsy comes back positive, there\u0027s still a potential cure. With this, there\u0027s no cure. The result is final. Like death.Read Post | Comments (1658)BIOJohann Hari, 10.23.2008Shahnaz\u0027s husband and his brothers carefully gathered up battery acid, pinned her down, and hurled it into her face.
