{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"The Edmonton Journal recently called Jeff Skoll \"the greatest Canadian you\u0027ve never heard of.\" But, in fact, Skoll, beyond being the first president of eBay, has been a pioneer in the world of cutting edge philanthropy. Today, he is being presented with Canada\u0027s highest civilian honor, the Order of Canada, for his wide-ranging philanthropic work. The Order, which will be presented by Governor-General David Johnston, carries the motto Desiderantes Meliorem Patriam (\"They desire a better country\"). This fits Skoll, but only to a degree. He has gone far beyond merely desiring a better country, and indeed a better world, to empowering people to achieve solutions everywhere in the world. Here is my interview with him -- a man who fits perfectly in our Inspirationals series, combining, as he does, an audacious vision, an innovative mind, and a deeply empathetic heart.Read Post | Comments (34)Mohamed A.

I am. Parenting is a significant part of my life, but it\u0027s not the sum total of my being and not something that\u0027s part of most adult relationships outside my home.Read Post | CommentsMark Kleinschmidt, 05/25/12Mayor, Chapel Hill, N.C.; attorney, Tin Fulton Walker OwenWhile I understand that this is a natural response to the passage of such a discriminatory act, one that targets innocent North Carolinians for the worst of reasons, misunderstanding and bigotry, I\u0027m asking everyone to take a deep breath.Read Post | CommentsBen Patton, 05/25/12Co-Author, \u0027Growing Up Patton: Reflections on Heroes, History and Family Wisdom\u0027Many of the men and women in uniform returning to civilian communities in the next few years will be largely isolated from those they once fought alongside, or other veterans who might understand.
