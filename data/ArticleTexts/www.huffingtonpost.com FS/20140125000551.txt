{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Doug BandowSenior Fellow, the Cato InstituteA new pharaoh is rising in Egypt. Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is preparing to grasp supreme power, most likely as the country\u0027s next president. He is posing as democracy\u0027s savior while his troops are detaining or killing those who oppose him. The arrests and shootings continued during last week\u0027s constitutional referendum. After some time out of the news, Egypt has reemerged as perhaps the administration\u0027s greatest foreign policy failure. Washington has proved impotent in the face of political revolution, Islamist activism, and military repression. Terrorism is accelerating, and Egypt is likely to end up without stability, liberty, democracy, or prosperity. America should disengage from a crisis which it helped create but has no ability to resolve.Comments (17)Richard (RJ) EskowSenior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host, Take Action NewsWhat do you give a Wall Street CEO who supervised a unit that lost $6 billion through incompetent and illegal trading, and whose reign of mismanagement has cost his institution $20 billion in the last year -- a figure that would\u0027ve been much larger in a less morally compromised regulatory environment? If you\u0027re the Board of Directors of JPMorgan Chase, you give him a raise.CommentsTEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"Having \"the talk\" with her 8-year-old daughter was awkward enough. Then they decided to look up cats mating on the Internet, and soon actress and author Julia Sweeney was an inch away from showing her daughter porn. Don\u0027t miss the hilarious (and heartwarming) results.CommentsKate QuickMother, writer, professorI was an adjunct English professor in Alaska with a baby due. If I needed to take maternity leave, it would be unpaid. But the choice that I faced -- either care for my newborn or go broke -- was never really a choice. At 27, I was a college professor on food stamps.Comments (115)Kumi NaidooExecutive Director, Greenpeace InternationalEven faced with weakening demand prospects, outdated investment patterns are driving fossil fuel companies to waste trillions of dollars in developing reserves and infrastructure that will be stranded as the world moves beyond 20th century energy.Comments (34)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundFifty years after President Lyndon Johnson declared a War on Poverty, the United States is still not a fair playing field for millions of children afflicted by preventable poverty, hunger, homelessness, sickness, poor education and violence in the world\u0027s richest economy with a gross domestic product (GDP) of $15.7 trillion.Comments (77)Scarlett JohanssonActressWhile I never intended on being the face of any social or political movement, distinction, separation or stance as part of my affiliation with SodaStream, given the amount of noise surrounding that decision, I\u0027d like to clear the air.CommentsWadah KhanfarJournalist; President, Sharq ForumThe events of the past decades have been a reflection of the interests of the superpowers and the balance of global politics. The past few years have proven that the Middle East\u0027s dependence on international powers is no longer fruitful.Comments (20)Sen. Charles E. SchumerDemocratic U.S. Senator from New YorkIt\u0027s time we deal with the reality that, for the first time in American history, middle-class American incomes have declined for almost a generation. If middle-class incomes continue to decline, we will have a dramatically different America, a less optimistic, more sour America.Comments (29)Frank VoglAuthor, \u0027Waging War on Corruption - Inside the Movement Fighting the Abuse of Power\u0027If Wall Street is deaf to the big fines, then do not expect it to listen to the criticisms and the protests that inevitably will be all over the liberal political media in coming days, replete with tough talk from prominent politicians.CommentsClaire McCarthy, M.D.Pediatrician, Boston Children\u0027s Hospital, Harvard Medical SchoolNobody wants to talk to their kids about sex. Nobody wants to think about their kids having sex--the same way nobody likes to think about their parents having sex. As biologically unlikely as it might be, we\u0027d prefer to think that ours is the only generation that has ever or will ever have sex.CommentsMichael RothPresident, Wesleyan UniversityDespite their many differences, we can see in Jefferson and the Obamas a common commitment to a broad, open-ended education as a vehicle for disrupting entrenched elites. When the best educational resources are dominated by the wealthiest, they become an elite bent on cultivating their pleasures rather than on extending knowledge and cultural vitality.CommentsFelix MarquardtFounder, The Atlantic DinnersTo the contrary, following President Francois Hollande\u0027s historic embrace of social democracy in a major policy speech last week, there is reason to believe that the French have finally found their way.CommentsJoe CirincionePresident, Ploughshares Fund; Author, \u0027Nuclear Nightmares: Securing the World Before It Is Too Late\" (forthcoming, Fall 2013)Perhaps we need 50 or even 100 nuclear weapons. To be safe, perhaps we keep an active stockpile of 450 nuclear weapons, as nuclear experts recommended in a 2012 study. We have 5,000 today.CommentsJohn FefferCo-director, Foreign Policy In FocusThe latest violence in Iraq rivals the levels last seen during wartime. Last year, between 8,000 and 10,000 civilians were killed, the highest number since 2008.CommentsArianna HuffingtonThe launch of The WorldPost comes at a time when the hunger for an expanded global conversation is stronger than ever.Comments (94)Paul PolmanCEO, UnileverPermissible growth in the future has to be based on sustainable and equitable models. Having acquired a license to operate, it\u0027s time for business to earn a license to lead.Comments (19)Walter IsaacsonPresident and CEO, Aspen InstituteInnovation is wonderful, but on its own it\u0027s not the holy grail. Other things matter just as much in creating a great company or product, most notably execution and focus. Apple excels at these things. That\u0027s why I use an iPhone and iPad. Innovation without execution produces footnotes to history, such as the Xerox Alto and Star.Comments (21)J.D. RothmanBlogger, www.TheNeuroticParent.comOnce college applications are completed, high school seniors enter a lull period, an interminable limbo, worsened by the pressure to keep their grades up. These months can be even more terrible for parents, who need to remain cheery even though they can no longer \"make things right\" for their kids.CommentsJohn OnaiyekanCardinal and Roman Catholic Archbishop of AbujaThe question of values in leadership boils down to why people seek leadership positions in the first place.CommentsMichael S. Broder, Ph.D.Psychologist; Author, \u0027Stage Climbing: The Shortest Path to Your Highest Potential\u0027Arguably, the most important thing to remember is what has long-term implications. Trust is a fragile commodity and is easily damaged. Always assume that they will \"fact check\" you in some way. It may not be right away, but inevitably, the topic -- whatever it is -- will come up at some point with their siblings, cousins, friends or teachers.CommentsJeff BogleBlogger, Out With The Kids \u0026 Good Men ProjectDid you spy the wicked grille up there, junior? How \u0027bout them sweet curves on the rear taillights, young whippersnapper? Word. That\u0027s how I roll.CommentsWray HerbertAuthor, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027Making a living kidney donation is not risk-free, which is why it\u0027s called extraordinary altruism. Fewer than one in 10,000 people take such a step, so it\u0027s been almost impossible to study the social and psychological precursors of this action. Until now.CommentsDavid MacMillanEnergy policyI hope Bill Nye doesn\u0027t underestimate creationists. Between their strident religious confidence and the way they painstakingly dumb-down and oversimplify evidence to fit into 6,000 years, people like Ken Ham can be tough nuts to crack.Comments (357)Don TapscottAdvisor to government and business leaders; Author, \u0027Macrowikinomics\u0027In the past we only worried about Big Brother governments assembling detailed dossiers about us. Then came what privacy advocates called Little Brother -- corporations that collect data from their customers. Now there is a new unexpected threat -- ourselves.CommentsBob BurnettBerkeley writer, retired Silicon Valley executiveRepublicans have begun their campaign to regain the Senate in the 2014-midterm elections. So far, they\u0027ve emphasized negative ads about Obamacare. If this tactic falters, the GOP will fall back on the same lies they used in the 2012 presidential election.Comments (36)Susan StiffelmanFamily therapist, Author, Parenting Without Power StrugglesChildhood is brief; as the ubiquitous presence of media exposes our little ones to more and more \"realities\", they are being pushed to grow up at accelerated rates. Despite the arguments one can make about the importance of telling children the true truth, there are times when I believe it is okay to blur the edges of reality, as long as no one is being hurt.CommentsChris KowalAssistant Professor of Consumer Science, Purdue UniversityProcedures were not clear. Classroom doors did not lock. Communication systems were not consistent; students received information sooner in many cases than did the faculty. I believe this lack of preparedness is true across our nation.Comments (72)Laura GottesdienerAuthor, \u0027A Dream Foreclosed\u0027Until recently, I knew almost nothing about the Mexican Zapatista movement except that the excessive number of \"a\"s looked vaguely suspicious to me. It\u0027s also why I felt compelled to travel thousands of miles to a Zapatista \"organizing school\" in the heart of the Lacandon jungle in southeastern Mexico to try to sort out just what I\u0027d been missing all these years.CommentsJason StanfordDemocratic consultant and writerPearson, the testing company that has gotten rich by making American students fill in little bubbles all day long, is advising the White House on how to whip us all into college-ready shape.Comments (17)Marty KaplanUSC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorReviews throw a spotlight on work we might ignore, and they can embed that work in a context and tradition we might only dimly be aware of. The problem is that reviews also function as commodities.CommentsDennis Nally, 2014.24.01Joe Cirincione, 2014.24.01Earl Ofari Hutchinson, 2014.24.01Scarlett Johansson, 2014.24.01Lisa Rinkus, 2014.24.01Woodson Merrell, M.D., 2014.24.01Travel + Leisure, 2014.24.01Marisa Leigh, 2014.24.01Kimberlie I.
