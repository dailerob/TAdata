{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027President Obama has been getting a lot of grief in the last few weeks over his pledge that with the ACA in place, people would be able to keep their insurance if they like it. The media have been filled with stories about people across the country who are having their insurance policies terminated, ostensibly because they did not meet the requirements of the ACA. While this has led many to say that Obama was lying, there is much less here than meets the eye. On closer inspection, the claim that President Obama lied in saying that people could keep their insurance looks like another Fox News special. In the only way that the pledge could be interpreted as being meaningful, the pledge is true. The ACA does not eliminate plans that were in existence at the time the bill was approved.Comments (640)Tony SchwartzPresident of The Energy Project; Author of Be Excellent at Anything: The Four Keys to Transforming the Way We Work and LiveThink about your typical workday. How often do you wake up in the morning, excited to get to work? How much time do you spend fighting traffic to get to the office? Do you run from meeting to meeting, with no time in between, as emails pile up unanswered in your inbox?Comments (32)Zia YusufPresident and CEO, Streetline, Inc.Cities are epicenters of creativity, innovation, adventures, energy, and life. They\u0027re moving, breathing, and living. Cities have a heart, personality, and looks. But a city lacks one thing: a voice. Thanks to the Internet of Things, this is quickly changing.Comments (2)Laura SteppPulitzer Prize-winning journalistIs it too much to hope that one day, using birth control will be like getting a flu shot or taking your vitamins?

Yes, our most heroic general and inspiring president, who warned us in his farewell address \"to guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism.\" It\u0027s an alert that\u0027s been ignored in the nation\u0027s hysterical reaction to the attacks of 9/11.Comments (28)Karyn ThurstonFull-time mama and writer, www.girlofcardigan.comThese are the words I wish I\u0027d read before jumping headlong into the mommyhood with my books and my charts and my ideals and my high horses. They\u0027re flawed, and they aren\u0027t all pretty, but they\u0027re hard-won and honest and as true as I can get \u0027em.Comments (20)Brenda Della CasaAuthor, \"Cinderella Was a Liar\"; Owner \u0026 Editor-In-Chief: Staggered Magazine, Editor-In-Chief, Preston Bailey Designs; Founder \u0026 Editor-In-Chief: Life In Style www.bdclifeinstyle.comI am one of those \"welfare\" people so many people callously group into the \"lazy\" section of the room. While I am often told by these same people that I am one of the hardest working people they know, the reality is that there is no way I would be where I am today without the help I received in my past.CommentsDr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarWould a female president have pushed us into the second Iraq War? Would the stereotypical female drive for collaboration and consensus have tempered the primarily male certainties of American exceptionalism? We won\u0027t know until the next global face-off when there is a female at the helm.Comments (310)Bianca JaggerFounder and Chair, Bianca Jagger Human Rights FoundationI appeal to President Xi Jinping to commit to progressing the recommendations made by UN member states on Tibet. He should immediately agree on dates for a visit from Navi Pillay, so that she may investigate the Tibetan grievances which have contributed to the tragic wave of self-immolations over the last two years.Comments (11)Rabbi Shmuley BoteachRabbi and WriterWhile our secular, porn-saturated culture increasingly sees men as sex-obsessed intelligent primates, I see men as intimacy-seekers, searching out a woman who can nurture their hearts, cultivate their humanity, and with whom they can achieve a sense of oneness.CommentsMark Penn and Don BaerGiven the state of our economy today, we may not have the luxury of a moonshot like the GI Bill or the invention of the Internet to restore Americans\u0027 faith in opportunity. But we must do something, because our young people are internalizing the melancholy as the new normal.Comments (49)Marty KaplanDirector, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolWithout the Benghazi drum to beat, Lindsay Graham, Darrell Issa and the shows that love them have reverted to the Obamacare apocalypse to keep us scared and watching. What\u0027s so strange is that there\u0027s an actual Armageddon in plain sight that\u0027s failing to get the red-siren treatment.CommentsWendell PotterAuthor, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgConsidering his very serious and costly preexisting condition, Robert was nervous as he started looking for a replacement policy. He could barely believe what he heard: he could get better coverage than the policy being discontinued -- and pay less -- thanks to Obamacare.CommentsMichelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesToday, with Hawaii on the verge of becoming the 16th state to pass marriage equality, and with gays much more visible, conservative ideologues are having a harder time raising money around the marriage issue.

In Silicon Valley, an announcement like this is expected, the norm, no big deal. The thing is, it is terrifying to me.CommentsWait But Whywww.waitbutwhy.comIt\u0027s a dictatorship of the most extreme kind, a cult of personality beyond anything Stalin or Mao could have imagined, a country as closed off to the world and as secretive as they come -- a true hermit kingdom. So why would an American tourist ever be allowed into the country?Comments (212)Harris O’MalleyDating coachI did have a few breakups I would qualify with, \"I don\u0027t mean \u0027I can\u0027t be bothered to figure out where things went wrong, I mean that she was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder,\" but for the most part, \"crazy\" meant \"acting in a way I didn\u0027t like.\" I didn\u0027t realize just how damaging this attitude was in the way I related to women.CommentsJonathan Hastings and Ray SawhillMichael Hastings\u0027 older brother Jonathan agreed to talk to about his brother\u0027s life: his ambitions, interests, as well as Jonathan\u0027s own take on the conspiracy theories surrounding Mike\u0027s death.CommentsPatrick MulcaheyCommunity activist and six-time Emmy-winning daytime TV writerCritics have showered Dallas Buyers Club with praise, which is good news for Focus Features and Matthew McConaughey, whose outsized performance swings for the fences. But it\u0027s bad news for LGBT history and the history of AIDS activism.CommentsTom EngelhardtEditor, TomDispatch.comIf the drip-drip-drip of Snowden\u0027s mother of all leaks -- which began in May and clearly won\u0027t stop for months to come -- has taught us anything, however, it should be this: omniscience is not omnipotence. At least on the global political scene today, they may bear remarkably little relation to each other.CommentsArin GreenwoodEditor, HuffPost DCI left a well-paying lawyer job in New York to move to a small tropical island near Guam. I\u0027d like to say it was some sort of insight about the Meaning Of Life. In reality, it was a terrific combination of terrible things in the romance, personal well-being and employment departments.Comments (32)Amitai EtzioniProfessor of international relations, George Washington UniversityTraditionally we lived in small communities, in which people were aware of the behavior of others.

I can appreciate how this ensemble might appear to clash -- the red carpet next to the green-brown fields dotting a country that\u0027s 80 percent rural. But sometimes juxtaposing seemingly incongruous things can reveal an underlying truth.Comments (113)Jon HotchkissCreator, ThisvsThatShow.comFor this new post, I\u0027ve gone back and re-watched the same 5 hours of FOX News as I did last week. You\u0027d be surprised how much blood spilled from my eyes this time, what with the scars from last week still raw and moist. Anyway, this time I didn\u0027t look for scams. I looked for African Americans.Comments (237)Brynn TannehillDirector of Advocacy, SPART*AThe ostensible goal of libertarian theory is a good one: equality of opportunity for everyone. However, when we look at what happens when libertarian ideals are implemented, the results are just the opposite.CommentsEric FriedmanAuthor, Reinventing Philanthropy: A Framework for More Effective GivingAmericans donate over $300 billion annually to nonprofits, averaging about $1,000 per person. We feel good when we give to our favorite charities. At the same time, philanthropy is broken, and almost everyone knows it.CommentsThomas WhiteGlobal Academic Fellow, NYU ShanghaiAmidst economic crises and an embarrassing era of political dysfunction (See: government shutdown), the U.S. remains the world\u0027s only superpower. An upheaval of the international power dynamic, in this century, requires more than economic or military might.CommentsRev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkRenisha McBride\u0027s death is a tragedy that simply didn\u0027t have to take place. It raises many questions about preconceptions, bias, profiling, motive and more -- all of which need to be thoroughly examined and investigated.Comments (95)Allison VesterfeltWriterIf I had it to do over again, I would have given myself some context for how much money $20,000 or $30,000 really was.
