{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Mary BottariThe Progressive/Center for Media and DemocracyA majority of the Senate recently voted to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour recently, yet the bill failed to clear the 60-vote hurdle necessary for passage -- thanks in no small part to the political power of the National Restaurant Association, the restaurant industry\u0027s trade association. For years, the \"Other NRA\" has flexed its political muscle to keep wages low and to freeze the tipped minimum wage at just $2.13 per hour. Plus, thanks to non-stop NRA lobbying, the House last month passed a bill changing the threshold for employer-provided coverage under the Affordable Care Act to deny health care to employees who work 30 hours per week.Despite my intentions, I did nothing, consumed as I was at the time with other stories, and still unconvinced that C. had anything worthwhile to say... That\u0027s how close I came to blowing off one of the largest and most consequential national security leaks in U.S. history.Glenn GreenwaldEditor, The Intercept; Author, \u0027No Place to Hide\u0027Republicans have only one goal -- to turn this tragedy into a scandal. Their relentless campaign to use the events in Benghazi to score cheap political points ahead of the midterm elections is appalling.Sen. Barbara BoxerU.S. Senator from Californa; Senior Member of the Senate Foreign Relations CommitteeBeing a woman (cis, trans or otherwise) means that you grow accustomed to men and sometimes women commenting about your body on a regular basis without provocation.Courtney MeakerMarketing Director, Macha Monkey Productions and Artist Relations and Education Coordinator, UW World SeriesThe United States now ranks 60th out of 180 countries on maternal deaths occurring during pregnancy and childbirth.

If you don\u0027t believe me, just take a look at modern history.Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkMy tummy has housed three babies and my boobs have provided over 4000 meals to my tribe; for that I am proud of my body and no longer ashamed.Taryn BrumfittFounder of Body Image MovementIt\u0027s important to understand that Boko Haram did not emerge in a vacuum. It is almost a direct result of the failed state that is corrupt and unable to provide even a basic level of safety and services to the country\u0027s citizens.Jacob K. OluponaProfessor of African and African American Studies, Harvard University Faculty of Arts and SciencesWhat does it mean when the Grocery Manufacturers Association, which represents the world\u0027s packaged food and drink industry, puts out a defensive press release about a documentary before it is released? I\u0027d say it means they are scared, and, after viewing the new film Fed Up, I can understand why.Nancy HuehnergarthPresident, Nancy F. Huehnergarth ConsultingWe know that a coordinated community response -- one that relies on partnerships with student groups, campus police, community victim services organizations, campus ministries, and school officials -- is what is required to turn the tide on this issue.Tony WestAssociate Attorney General of the United StatesIn polling anti-Semitic attitudes, this survey plays an important role in setting the stage for the broader discussion of anti-Semitism in varying societies, providing important context for offensive and violent expressions of anti-Semitism.Abraham H. FoxmanNational Director, Anti-Defamation LeagueMany of us start running long before we have children. Many also stop running after becoming parents due to the large time commitment both demand. But for those who have found a way to fit both into their lives, it\u0027s often obvious because, well, we get a little weird -- even for a runner.Audra RundleWriter, runner, mom, ultra marathoner, editorThe thing is: It just doesn\u0027t matter, because the students who might be corrupted by these dangerous voices don\u0027t listen anyway. I know. I\u0027ve been there as a graduation speaker and as a recruiter of graduation speakers.Derek ShearerProfessor of Diplomacy at Occidental College and former US ambassadorAs Money Service Business accounts continue to be closed, the ultimate victims are the Somalis who rely on remittances from abroad.Barkhad AbdiOscar-nominated actor, 2014 BAFTA winner, Goodwill Ambassador for AdesoNow that I\u0027m an adult out there in the world with a job and a life and responsibilities, I have had to work incredibly hard to \"keep it together.\"Karen Ann KennedyCertified Health Coach and President \u0026 CEO, The Caring Coaching Center, LLC The Caring Coaching Center, LLCWe must pray for these particular girls and also that this event and moment could draw our attention and our hearts to see how God is using educated and empowered women and girls to change the world. We believe God is doing that, and those who oppose that are indeed the enemies of God.Jim WallisDalia MogahedWhen Marco Rubio tells America that climate change may not be a concern, and that there would be huge costs in doing anything about it, it\u0027s worth asking whether his ties to America\u0027s biggest fossil fuel companies, and the climate denial industry they bankroll, are influencing his views.David HalperinAttorney, advocate, writer at RepublicReport.orgBarbara Walters had a building named after her, but that\u0027s not her legacy. Barbara Walters interviewed every president since Nixon, but it\u0027s the smaller moments she remembers most. And it\u0027s this small moment on this unexpected day in May that I probably will too.Catherine TaibiAssociate Media Editor, The Huffington PostSometimes, external things that have absolutely nothing to do with you personally get in the way of the job offer or completely derail the hiring process. While, other times, the rejection is personal, possibly something you might have avoided.Susan P. JoyceEditor and chief technology writer, Job - Hunt.orgDido Elizabeth Belle was born in 1761 and died in 1804, yet the experiences that this film projects in its illustration of the past bear shocking resemblance to the challenges that black women (and black people) face in the United States today.Olivia ColePoet, author, and activistWhether one chooses to think of them as the dramatic equivalent of dim sum, the theatrical version of tapas, or the documentary field\u0027s offering of donut holes, short plays and films have a dynamic all their own.George HeymontSan Francisco-based arts criticFrom a public health point of view, abortion care, no less than contraception, is an essential measure to prevent the heartbreak of infant mortality, and to prevent another tragedy as well -- maternal death.Terry O\u0027NeillPresident, National Organization for WomenApproximately 35 outfits from the British import are on display at the mansion-turned-museum, along with backstory on the designs and details (you can get close enough to see the frayed ends on one gown; another vintage piece ripped during wearing and had to be carefully mended with matching fabric).Erin RuberryWriter and editor; former managing blog editor, The Huffington PostIt\u0027s okay to do life backwards, or sideways, or weirdly. It is, after all, your life.Beth LeybaCommunity activist, writer, student, momIf you\u0027ve never been clinically obese and walked into a fitness class, then it is hard to describe the courage and fortitude it takes to turn 180 degrees and literally move your titanic self towards health.Betsy MartinStay-at-home-mom, lawyer, cycling instructorHere are my observations on how women approach beauty in four different hemispheres.Napoleon PerdisMakeup artistHis state veered hard to the right on tax policy, and as a result its economy has underperformed the rest of country, and his budget is in shambles.Ian ReifowitzAuthor of \u0027Obama’s America: A Transformative Vision of Our National Identity\u0027Government will never get fixed until humans within it are allowed the flexibility that goes along with taking responsibility.
