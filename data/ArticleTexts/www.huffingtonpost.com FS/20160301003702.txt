{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Right-wing populism, through the candidacy of Donald Trump, is ascendant, and it has notable breaks from mainstream conservatism. Conservatives are intimate allies of Wall Street while populists play on the resentment of Wall Street. Populists tend not to be religious fundamentalists, while right-wing Republicans pander to the religious right. And the Republican right loathes government, while populists are willing to use it. If you think Obama expanded executive power, just wait for President Trump. No wonder Karl Rove, the Koch Brothers, the Bushes and the rest of the Republican elite feel like taking hemlock. Not only does Trump\u0027s populism hose away their power, but his appeal demonstrates that the vaunted Republican base, once the issues are unpacked, is a lot less conservative than they imagined.Hillary Clinton was my Senator in 2002, and as a constituent who possessed unmatched qualifications on the issue of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, I felt I had a duty to brief her; and as her constituent, she had a responsibility to give me a hearing. But she never did.Author, \u0027Dangerous Ground\u0027By squeezing wages and rigging the economic game in your favor, you have invited an unprecedented political backlash -- against trade, immigration, globalization, and even against the establishment itself.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027When supporters of Bernie Sanders question Hillary Clinton\u0027s substantial campaign donations from corporate interests and Wall Street, they have an undeniable point. Yet it\u0027s her byzantine family foundation that creates perhaps the most troubling black hole of accountability.Author, \"Unaccountable\"Everything Black and Brown folks do is excellent because it\u0027s a feat to persist in a country and indeed a world that benefits, profits, and necessitates your oppression, your incarceration.author of [insert] boy and Don’t Call Us DeadI think I speak for many fellow Europeans when I say that I am have now moved on to full-blown panic mode: America, what the hell?Advisor at the Norwegian think tank Agenda, and a frequent contributor on U.S. politics in the Norwegian mediaThis significant decline should send a clear message to the Academy and to movie studio executives that we will not tolerate discriminatory practices whether they impact what we see on screen or what takes place behind the lens.President, National Action NetworkIran can still surprise. Voter turnout has surpassed 60 percent. Victory by candidates aligned with President Rouhani already exceeds expectations. This begs the question: What just happened?Research Director, National Iranian American CouncilWarren doesn\u0027t put it in such harsh terms, but this is a scathing indictment of the Obama administration. If there were any question about why Obama has not been a Progressive, it is answered here.Writer, thinker, musician.Trump\u0027s Mussolini-gate was misused as an opportunity to call the guy stupid or dangerous in a brown-shirt sort of way. The real issue is whether or not the American people can (or should) trust someone in the nation\u0027s highest office who has demonstrated, time and time again, poor impulse control.Author of Swiped. Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Co-founder of Credit.com and IDT911When one group controls powerful cultural platforms, like white heterosexual men in the Hollywood film industry, it elevates and legitimates their worldview over that of other groups and marginalizes the experiences and humanity of the dominated groups in the process.Founder and President of Global Policy Solutions, the Center for Global Policy Solutions, and GlobalPolicy.tvOur \"open science\" research collaboration with Flint residents revealed high levels of lead, Legionella and damage to potable water infrastructure due to a failure to implement corrosion control treatment. Our work, by any measure, succeeded. But at the same time, this experience has forced us to confront broader questions.Independent source of news and analysis, from the academic and research community.The model minority myth is often used as a tool to protect white supremacy, deny institutionalized racism against Black Americans and justify anti-Black racism.Student and campus editor-at-large, San Diego State UniversityWhen Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton took the stage one after another at Colorado\u0027s annual Democratic Party dinner earlier this month, I immediately understood why Bernie has ignited the campaign season - and why Hillary should be president.Swanee Hunt is a philanthropist, a lecturer in public policyat Harvard Kennedy School, and former US Ambassador to Austria in the Clinton Administration.Apple is not above the law. And its managers should note that when the next major terrorist attack takes place -- whether or not it includes a dirty bomb -- we are surely to learn that Apple\u0027s phones facilitated the attack.Professor of international relations, George Washington UniversityThere\u0027s a pretty high likelihood that, at some point in their lives, my daughters will be sexually active. When that day comes, I couldn\u0027t live with myself if I had done anything to increase the risk that they\u0027ll die from it. That may not be the way some parents think of their actions, but that is the reality.Author of \u0027Obama’s America: A Transformative Vision of Our National Identity\u0027Detective stories have been making a splash on European screens for the past decade. Some attract top-notch directors, actors and script writers. They are far superior to anything that appears over here -- whether on TV or from Hollywood.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghMexico isn\u0027t going to pay for the wall, and we\u0027re not going to deport millions of people and break up families. If you think either one is a good idea, you\u0027re not smart and probably not a person I want to hang out with.Author, missionary and business consultantHow the Republican establishment could have settled on Marco Rubio as their champion boggles the mind. Eight years ago, Republicans mocked Democrats for nominating a first term senator whose main claim to fame was his ability to give a good speech.President, Fiscal Strategies GroupWhenever you buy any item from Good Man Brand, $3 will go to a charitable organization that needs it. We will pick a new cause every year. This year, the money will benefit inner-city education.Quarterback, Seattle Seahawks; Co-founder, Good Man BrandI\u0027m not suggesting women vote for Hillary simply because she\u0027s a woman. There are plenty of women I wouldn\u0027t vote for. But I want young women to know what it was like for \"boomer\" girls like me, growing up in the 1950s, before they make their decision.Criminal defense appellate lawyerMusic brought our family together during extraordinarily difficult times. As music filled Micah\u0027s hospital room, the songs nurtured our relationships. We bonded over music because it gave us a shared experience - that wasn\u0027t about the next medical procedure.Founder of the NEC SocietyThe key to political persuasion, much like the key to selling, is to appeal to the audience\u0027s beliefs -- not your own. If Trump\u0027s perceived strength, success and unvarnished candor are animating his acolytes, then that\u0027s the only way to take him down.Author, \u0027The Language of Trust: Selling Ideas in a World of Skeptics\u0027Depression is real. It can\u0027t be swept under the rug. We need to deal with it. Now. Before it\u0027s too late. Doctors should be screening everyone. Not just new moms. Depression can happen at any time. And it needs to be treated. Like the common illness it is.Eileen O’Connor lives life to the fullest. With her unapologetic love for wine and honest humor, she looks at life through rose-colored glasses.A new study confirms what many activists have suspected for a long time: The private courts set up by international \"trade\" deals heavily favor billionaires and giant corporations, and they do so at the expense of governments and people.Writer/Editor, Bernie 2016It\u0027s lights out in Lorain on March 31. The town\u0027s steel mill, site of a new electric arc furnace and $120 million investment, had given 1,200 Ohioans good middle-class jobs this time last year. But by April, a relentless avalanche of underpriced Chinese steel will have shoved all but a few of those workers into the street.International President, United SteelworkersLo and behold the looniest pro-gun group, a.k.a., my friends at Doctors for Responsible Gun Ownership, let fly with yet another attempt to challenge the assumption that physicians align what they say with at least some regard for reality, if not for facts.Mike the Gun GuyThe renewed debate over the merits of single-payer health reform has been marred by misleading claims that such reform is unnecessary and unaffordable. We write to set the record straight. Despite the advances of the Affordable Care Act, the health care financing system continues to inflict needless suffering on our patients. Nearly 30 million Americans remain uninsured.Professor in the CUNY School of Public Health at Hunter College; Lecturer in Medicine, Harvard Medical School; Co-founder, Physicians for a National Health ProgramProfessor of Public Health at CUNY and Lecturer in Medicine at Harvard Medical School; Co-founder, Physicians for a National Health ProgramIf the future health of a political party didn\u0027t in any sense depend on its courtship of independent voters, young voters, new voters, or white males, the size of Clinton\u0027s spread in South Carolina would indeed have been an across-the-board endorsement of her candidacy. Instead, it somehow emphasized Sanders\u0027 vaguely Obama-like qualities in the midst of an election result so horrid for Sanders that we\u0027ve rarely before seen its like in a two-candidate tilt whose national polling is essentially tied.Assistant Professor of English at University of New Hampshire; Series Co-Editor, Best American Experimental WritingBeing vegan certainly doesn\u0027t make my life simple. Every day, I have to do research and make choices, but a lifestyle based on compassion for animals is clearly the right one for me. I have chosen a complicated path, but my conscience is clear.Author of the blog Glam \u0026 ConsciousI\u0027ve voted Democrat all my life because I hold progressive positions on civil rights, health care, foreign policy, criminal justice, and the environment. That gives me plenty of reasons to not vote Republican.Host of The Russ Belville ShowGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
