{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Dan RatherHost, \u0027Dan Rather Reports\u0027In thinking about Nelson Mandela, his life and his legacy, a metaphor comes to mind: that of a great, one-for-the-ages comet -- not unlike the Comet ISON that recently traveled around the sun. Mandela was a great comet of a man; we are not likely to see someone like him again anytime soon. He was a man who made a towering difference in history by the sheer force of his character. This included his steel determination, his dedication to forgiveness of and reconciliation with his enemies, and a willingness to grow, adapt and change for the better, for the betterment of his country and, no exaggeration, the world.Comments (17)Muhammad AliBoxing LegendMandela.
