{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Children\u0027s Defense FundNext week marks the second anniversary of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the federal health reform legislation, which has been a giant national step forward in reaching the goal of ensuring that all children in America receive the healthy start they need and deserve. Although not yet fully implemented, millions of children have already benefited and millions more will be helped as additional benefits take effect in 2014. But these gains and a number of Medicaid protections that millions of Americans rely on could all be erased by challenges to the ACA and Medicaid in the U.S. Supreme Court this month. Together we must speak out against these efforts to turn back the clock of progress.Read Post | Comments (104)Jared Bernstein, 03/16/12Senior Fellow, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesOftentimes in public policy, particularly when national politics is frozen, you have to look to governors and states to see what\u0027s coming.Read Post | Comments (385)Angie Ahmadi, 03/16/12Associate, National Iranian American CouncilShould conservative factions in Iran unite under the auspices of the Supreme Leader, western diplomats will face a less challenging task in advancing nuclear negotiations forward.Read Post | Comments (75)Lisa Belkin, 03/17/12Senior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, Huffington PostThe 21st birthday that seemed impossibly distant back then is now here -- and with its arrival comes my realization that I have been planning for it before you and I had even met.Read Post | Comments (12)James Zogby, 03/17/12President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Arab and Muslim immigrants have become increasingly fearful of law enforcement.
