{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureHillary, of course, is the prohibitive favorite for the nomination. The money and machinery awaits her announcement. But her long experience makes it less likely that she will lay out a bold new direction and demand a mandate for change. Our campaigns don\u0027t feature issue debates. But win or lose, a strong populist run would strengthen the rising movement on the left of the Democratic Party. Their arguments would reach citizens who are struggling to make sense out of a world that seems out of kilter, and a politics that seems more and more dominated by big money and entrenched interests. There is a fertile ground that needs tilling. A primary challenge won\u0027t on its own build a movement, but it can surely help fertilize one.You know you\u0027re a bigot when you can\u0027t take out the word \"Muslim\" from a sentence you stated and replace it with \"Jew\" and still have it be socially acceptable.

All of this sounds an awful lot like ideas embedded in abstinence-only sex ed.Feminist, writer, and satirist (not always in that order)Maybe saying grace feels hokey or forced to you. Perhaps you think your kids would roll their eyes. If you don\u0027t believe in God, the ritual before the meal may feel unnatural: who exactly are you thanking, and why?Author of The Opposite of Spoiled: Raising Kids Who Are Grounded, Generous and Smart About Money, Your Money columnist for the New York Times, contributor to MotherlodeOver the past few days and weeks, we have seen too much evidence that far from being a painful memory of the past, anti-Semitism is still very much alive in Europe.Europe researcher, Human Rights WatchWe need to stop using military force as a solution to everything -- indeed, it is a solution to nothing. We must push for the repeal of the 2001 AUMF and prevent the passage of a new AUMF. We cannot rely on Congress or the president to reverse the course of rampant U.S. militarism. It is up to us to make our voices heard.Professor, Thomas Jefferson School of LawNew bills introduced in state legislatures in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Missouri would outlaw the safest method of second-trimester abortion in America.

When we analyze the fall of major civilizations of the past it was not war but more often environmental and resource implosion which did them in.EntrepreneurAfter the murderous attacks in Paris and Copenhagen, one might wonder whether a newspaper that published the Charlie Hebdo cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad in the United States would be protected by the First Amendment. The government might make two primary arguments in support of a law prohibiting the publication of the cartoons.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoRapid Isolation and Treatment of Ebola (RITE) teams in Liberia are slowing the epidemic, and CDC is working closely with governments and partners in Guinea and Sierra Leone to adopt similar rapid response strategies.Director, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)I was not surprised to learn that the Senate is looking into the Internet of Things. Senators are concerned about safety, privacy and security issues now that the tech industry is focusing on ways to connect devices to the Internet and to each other.Technology journalistBut Lent is a journey, not a pass-fail test. Trust me, if it were at all possible to fail Lent, I would have long ago been expelled from this spiritual school. Fortunately, the goal here is not a perfect score at the end of 40 days. In fact, let\u0027s throw out the word \"goal\" and focus instead on practice -- spiritual practice.Spiritual writer, retreat leader and inspirational speakerTo be the guest of a great lord in his castle was an honor reserved for notable visitors known to the host, but others would arrive with a letter of introduction from the king or queen or a member of their family or friends of the host.Author and Historian; author of the acclaimed Anjou Trilogy and frequent lecturer and historical writer.Why are college students \"children\" when they try to be political, while actual children get clickbaited as political truth-tellers? I\u0027m afraid they\u0027re two sides of the same counterfeit coin.Professor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027Should the federal government task teachers, religious leaders, and mental health professionals with rating and reporting to law enforcement about the strength of a family\u0027s parent-child bond? A child\u0027s involvement in religious activities or his connection to a group identity? Whether there are \"ideologues\" within an American community or what its level of \"cohesiveness\" is?Director, ACLU’s National Security ProjectSo is James really the worst writer ever? Not exactly. We found similar errors in the work of everyone from Nicholas Sparks to Edith Wharton. When it comes to grammar goofs, no writer is immune.Automated ProofreaderActing immediately on climate change is nothing but in our best interest, both in its practicality and its symbolic value worldwide. Besides already being an economic and technological leader worldwide, we could easily lead the charge against global warming.ResearcherSelma is rightfully centered on Dr. King, and has been rightfully criticized for the way it portrays LBJ. But there\u0027s another slight that also distorts history, and that\u0027s the role King\u0027s wife Coretta played in the civil rights movement.Money Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsToo much money in our elections undermines representative democracy. But the FEC can begin to right its wrongs. It should recommit to enforcing the law and safeguarding democracy. And perhaps sometimes soon, the FEC should invite the public back to the podium for some good old-fashioned free speech -- the kind that doesn\u0027t cost a dime.Policy Counsel, Common CauseBy attempting to repeal President Obama\u0027s executive action through both the courts and the Department of Homeland Security funding bill, Republicans are taking the wrong approach to immigration reform.Latino Victory ProjectCongressman Honda\u0027s granddaughter will never have to wonder how her grandfather feels about her.

The choices you choose to make about benefits are up to you. But I figure at least we all ought to know them.PBS NewsHour econ correspondent; professor, Yale and Gateway CC; co-author, Get What\u0027s Yours: The Secrets to Maxing Out Your Social SecurityWhile the story is fiction, Julianne Moore\u0027s gripping portrayal of a person going through the stages of Alzheimer\u0027s disease in Still Alice is an all-too-real story faced every day by more than 5 million Americans and their caregivers. Her performance is a Hollywood reminder of why Alzheimer\u0027s research is so important.Assistant Investigator, Allen Institute for Brain Science.The U.S. now spends far less on essential public health services than virtually all industrialized nations -- and it shows.Dean of Global Public Health at New York University, and Director of the NYU Global Institute of Public HealthDean, City University of New York School of Public HealthThe U.S. Olympic Committee\u0027s decision last month to make Boston its candidate for the right to host the 2024 Summer Games has generated much excitement within the city and its environs.
