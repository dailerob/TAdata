{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUNetanyahu must understand that the eventual normalization of relations between the U.S. and Iran is the best way by which to eliminate the Iranian threat. Therefore, if there is any chance, however small, that such an agreement will stand the test of time, it must be explored. The alternative is leaving Iran free to redouble its effort to reach the nuclear threshold, forcing the U.S. to choose between the lesser of two evils: contain Iran (which is costly, dangerous, and prone to instability) or attack its nuclear facilities, which will further destabilize the region and undermine rather than enhance Israel\u0027s national security. Notwithstanding the accolades Netanyahu may receive from the floor of Congress, he has betrayed what is best for Israel. The Israeli electorate must remember this as they cast their votes come election day.America\u0027s resurgence is real. With a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, and booming energy production, we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth. Now we have to choose what we want that future to look like. Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well?44th President of the United StatesAs Obama and his team muddle toward their finish line, their achievements negligible, we might even express a modicum of gratitude. When they depart the scene, we will forget the lot of them. Yet at least they managed to steer clear of truly epic disasters.Author, \u0027The Limits of Power: The End of American Exceptionalism\u0027I am disheartened by the decision made by Senator John Cornyn, the incoming Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Human Rights, to remove \"Civil Rights\" and \"Human Rights\" from the name of the Subcommittee.Chief Executive Officer, The King CenterPeople across ideologies want our education system to work for America\u0027s children -- and that goes for many of National School Choice Week\u0027s backers as well as its critics. But let\u0027s not allow those whose real goal is the destruction of public education to cloak their agenda under the cheerful banner of \"school choice.\"President, People For the American WayIt is always inspiring to witness a rare act of transformation, especially when it involves someone we\u0027ve come to know and admire. This month, that startling moment of truth is on display in movie theaters across America.Award-winning actress, author and activistIf the invitation was aimed to extract a better deal from Iran and protect our friend and ally Israel, then the speaker miscalculated, for it will do the opposite. If the invitation was aimed at scoring political points by undermining the administration, it\u0027s deeply troubling that the speaker is willing to undercut diplomacy in exchange for theatrics on the House floor.U.S. Representative from OregonAbout six weeks after I have birth, I started a rapid decline into a state of complete misery. I would stare at the blank wall, sometimes for an hour straight, listening to the negative thoughts circulating in my mind.SF-Based Mom and \"New Parent Companion\"It may sound ridiculous at first, but a strategic deployment of the most common and visible form of personally identifiable information--the humble email address--might be enough to send a would-be identity thief packing to an easier mark.Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911Even if you\u0027ve read Lawrence Wright\u0027s book, Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood and the Prison of Belief on which the film is based, Gibney\u0027s adaptation is an eye-opening and transformative experience.It is a national disgrace that so many poor children live in the United States of America -- the world\u0027s richest economy. It doesn\u0027t have to be this way. It\u0027s costly. And it\u0027s the greatest threat to our future national, economic and military security.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundIt\u0027s getting harder to defend our economic and environmental interests against the corrupting influence of campaign cash. The struggle for a fairer economy is inseparable from the struggle to protect the planet -- and both will be more successful once we\u0027ve removed big money from our political process.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourHere\u0027s how a young New York State Assemblyman from Manhattan described his colleagues in Albany: One, he said, was \"entirely unprincipled, and with the same idea of public life and the civil service that a vulture has of a dead sheep.\" Another\u0027s \"intellectual capacity about equals that of an average balloon.\"Urban affairs correspondent for The New York Times; Author of \u0027A History of New York in 101 Objects\u0027As the minority-majority population becomes more of a reality, Hollywood has to go through a metamorphosis. I would guess that most smart executives know this and are looking for the kinds of partnerships that will keep them relevant. We must seize this opportunity and break down the tough walls of segregation in Hollywood.Founder, GlobalGrind.comIt\u0027s hard to believe some senators are still complaining about these cases, claiming the government should instead send them to military commissions at Guantanamo Bay. Meanwhile, due in large part to those complaints, the five alleged September 11 co-conspirators remain stuck in lengthy pretrial hearings at Guantanamo.Senior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstOn the initiative of the Bibliothèque National de France, the review La Règle du Jeu, and two young philosophers, Joseph Cohen and Raphaël Zagury-Orly, a major symposium was held last week on the subject of Heidegger and \"the Jews.\" Over the discussions hung the appearance of Heidegger\u0027s famous \"Black Notebooks,\" in which his anti-Semitism shows its face plainly.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.This is about more than awards deferred; it is about dreams deferred. It is about the lack of racial and gender diversity we find both behind the screen and in front of it. It is about the inevitable way the Academy\u0027s membership roll directly influences who gets nominated and who wins.President and CEO, National Urban LeagueWe\u0027ve done it before. In 1980, the world wiped the devastating disease smallpox off the face of the earth -- making it the only human disease eradicated in history. So what does it take to destroy another human disease again?Associate Editor, HuffPost ScienceI arrogantly assumed that my lack of a criminal record and the small amount of clean time I had accumulated would exonerate me and I would leave with a slap on the wrist. I was sentenced to 12 months in jail, five years probation, more than $3,000 in restitution and 100 hours of community service.Recovering addict, Blogger at ErinsInsideJob.com, freelancer, fitness enthusiastThough we call it \"entertainment\" what we see in movies and on TV drives the broader cultural conversation and has an important place in our society. Now, more than ever, it\u0027s important that women and people of color are a part of that exchange.Executive Director, Council of Urban ProfessionalsMy swim from Cuba to Florida, aside from the personal challenge to make endurance history across a wild, epic ocean, was always meant to also make a statement of hopeful reconnection between our two beautiful nations.Long-distance swimmer, journalist, and broadcasterIt\u0027s one thing for a school to offer private facilities for students who identify as gender-neutral or are not comfortable using male- or female-designated facilities because of their gender identity. But to force all transgender students to do so is, in fact, a definite breach in privacy.Visual Arts Student \u0026 GLSEN AmbassadorEven for students who have overcome statistics, escaped the so-called \"school-to-prison pipeline,\" and ascended into the most elite educational settings, the most basic messaging of this system for enforcing identity still resonates, if only through brief, but highly symbolic encounters.Third-year J.D. candidate at Yale Law SchoolIf you\u0027re going to defy protocol and encroach on the mandate of the president as commander-of-chief, why stop at Netanyahu? There are plenty of other controversial guest stars that Boehner and company could bring in to bat for their confrontational agenda.Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogMuch like NAFTA, the TPP has more to do with big-business protectionism than with genuine free trade. Most of the chapters seek to limit the regulatory powers of governments. Most damaging of all, the TPP would create new incentives for corporations to ship jobs overseas and would forbid governments from using strategies like \"Buy American\" provisions.Dean of the US House of Representatives | Ranking Member, House Judiciary CommitteeThe fact is that modesty, or even self-effacement, can be more effective than bragging in creating a good first impression. Most of us know this from being on the receiving end, yet we still err on the side of self-aggrandizement. But why do we get it wrong so much of the time? Here\u0027s where some new research may be illuminating.Author, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027No matter how far you go in your career, no matter how much you achieve, never stop working on your career. Consider it a work that\u0027s always in progress.President, Aflac U.S.The last-minute decision by Congressional Republicans not to vote on a 20-week abortion ban on the anniversary of Roe v. Wade stemmed from disagreement about rape victims. Missing from the discussion were other women who have abortions later than 20 weeks of pregnancy.Author, Every Third Woman in America: How Legal Abortion Transformed Our Nation;former Chief of the Abortion Surveillance Branch at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)Changing the way you think takes a lot of effort initially, but with practice, you\u0027ll notice big changes -- not just in the way you think, but also in the way you feel and behave. You can make peace with the past, look at the present differently, and think about the future in a way that will support your chances of reaching your goals.Psychotherapist and author of 13 Things Mentally Strong People Don\u0027t DoThe use of terms in the brief such as \"straightforward\" and \"plain meaning\" are those we\u0027ve been pushing for years, and it\u0027s gratifying to see them spoken by the government.Executive Director, Gender Rights MarylandDespite this long-awaited meltdown of U.S. policies that added to the island\u0027s economic woes but never succeeded in tumbling Cuba\u0027s communist government, a portion of the Cold War edifice remains intact: Cuba is still on the U.S. state sponsors of terrorism list.Co-founder, CODEPINK: Women for PeaceGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"FAR-RIGHT FRANCE: LE PEN LEADS IN POLL",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
