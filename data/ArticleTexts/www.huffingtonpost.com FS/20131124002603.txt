{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoSince President Obama took office, Republicans have used the filibuster an average of 14.4 times per year to block his nominations. That is 50 times higher than the 1952-2008 average, and more than 14 times higher than during the administration of President George W. Bush. It is a shame that the Republicans brought things to this pass. The filibuster is a useful tool to prevent a president whose party controls the Senate from pushing through the nomination of an appointee who is incompetent, who lacks integrity or whose views are truly outside the \"mainstream\" of respectable opinion. That we have now lost that important safeguard is deeply unfortunate. But the responsibility for this development rests squarely on the shoulders of the Republican members of the Senate, who have brought this not only upon themselves, but upon the nation. It is a sad day for America.Comments (367)TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"Psychologist Kelly McGonigal shares new research showing that it\u0027s our thinking about stress, rather than stress itself, that affects our health.Comments (172)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundI hope, as we remember a young President who asked us not to ask what our country can do for us but what we can do for our country, that we will renew our commitment to building with urgency and persistence a just America where every child is valued and enabled to achieve their God given potential regardless of the lottery of birth.Comments (36)Linda TiradoNight Cook, Essayist, ActivistWe know that the very act of being poor guarantees that we will never not be poor. It doesn\u0027t give us much reason to improve ourselves.Comments (3,437)Lisa EicherMother, bloggerWhen my husband and I announced to family and friends our decision to adopt our son, a 7-year-old boy with Down Syndrome in Bulgaria, the news was not met with open arms. I knew that there would be a lot of skeptics, but I didn\u0027t anticipate the pushback we were about to receive.Comments (59)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The Republicans have created a tempest out of trivialities. It is incumbent on Democrats -- from the president on down -- to show Americans the larger picture, and so so again and again.Comments (429)Pam RehalPaleo eating, CrossFit addicted, adrenaline junkieYou are probably sitting there going \"Ugh. Is she really going there?\" YUP I AM. I can also pretty much guarantee that at some point while reading this you are going to start nodding your head in agreement... I can\u0027t wait for that part.Comments (66)Matt WalshBlogger, talk radio host, father of twinsThat\u0027s our entire economic system: buy things. Everybody buy. It doesn\u0027t matter what you buy. Just buy. How appropriate, then, that a holiday created by our ancestors as an occasion to give thanks for what they had, now morphs into a frenzied consumerist ritual where we descend upon shopping malls to accumulate more things we don\u0027t need.Comments (623)Trita ParsiPresident, National Iranian American CouncilJust as Iran must accept certain limitations for a period time as a result of their past violations and the breach in trust, the West must accept that once Iran has restored trust, it must enjoy the same benefits that all other NPT states enjoy.Comments (22)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesThe wall-to-wall media coverage of the past few days has jarred my memory in interesting ways. I have no recollection of President Kennedy\u0027s assassination itself. I was only two and half years old. But the event is seared into my brain.CommentsMichael ShawPublisher of the visual politics and media literacy site, BagNewsNotesIf the White House intended even a half-respectful gesture, they would have provided access to the president yesterday. Instead, they offer up a photo, again taken by their own photographer with a caption starting off: \"Photojournalists photograph President Obama...\"CommentsDiane RavitchHistorian, NYU professorI met John Kennedy twice. He came to meet with the political science majors in 1958, and we spent an hour or so talking about the issues facing the nation. He was charming, handsome, funny, well-informed.CommentsPaul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostI worry that because of our rhetoric and poisoned political atmosphere that we have weakened our country; and the fracturing that began 50 years ago has developed into canyons that divide us. Perhaps that is why 9/11, for all its horror and repercussions is my generation\u0027s equivalent of John F. Kennedy\u0027s assassination.Comments (225)Chris GentilvisoSenior Politics Editor, The Huffington PostWith two decades of hindsight in our favor, it\u0027s worth taking a few moments today to think about what the big screen showed us in 1993, and where those issues stand now.Comments (21)Erin RuberryManaging blog editor, The Huffington Post; Contributing editor, HuffPost DCThe sign stopped me in my tracks: \"Since 2004, six people have died falling from the cliffs on this route.\" I promptly texted a photo of the warning to my mom back home in Maryland and continued along the trail.CommentsJamie Lee CurtisActress and children\u0027s book authorThat is the Kennedy I like to think of when everyone asks, \"Where were you when you heard JFK was shot.\" I was at my own birthday party with balloons and a Barbie cake with five glowing candles and presents and games and an understanding that something enormous had shifted in the universe and my happy birthday would never be truly happy again.Comments (67)Doug KendallFounder and President, Constitutional Accountability CenterOur federal government was designed as a republic. Within this system, and over time, elections were to have consequences and enlightened public opinion was to govern.Comments (764)Gary HartPresident, Hart International, Ltd.For those of us powerfully motivated toward public service by the Kennedy challenge to our idealism, one not heard since then, we choose to believe that he had the potential to become that rare political leader beyond politics, certainly beyond partisanship.Comments (36)Edward Jay EpsteinAuthor, \u0027The Annals of Unsolved Crime\u0027The possibility that Lee Harvey Oswald had assistance can never be precluded. But the real question is not how but why Oswald assassinated the president. His death ended the hope of unraveling his motive.Comments (233)Mark ShriverSenior Vice President for Strategic Initiatives, Save the ChildrenToday marks the 50th anniversary of President Kennedy\u0027s death, yet just 10 days ago, Jeanne and I were celebrating with my cousin Caroline Kennedy as she was sworn in as Ambassador to Japan.CommentsLester \u0026 CharliePolitical satiristsWow. We\u0027ve lived in this era of unchecked corporate greed for a while now. So it\u0027s rare that a company\u0027s actions take our breath away. But there you have it. The McDonald\u0027s hotline stopped just short of pointing out how much cheaper it is to kill yourself.Comments (217)Mark R. KennedyProfessor of political management and director of the Graduate School of Political Management, George Washington UniversityCentral to the Kennedy ideal is the idea of self-sacrifice for the greater good. In this day of political intransigence and not only inter-party, but also intra-party strife, blame seems to supplant earnest dialogue, and Kennedy\u0027s call appears long forgotten.CommentsLaurel MillerFood and travel writerMy bordering-on-obsessive hatred of \"foodie\" is really about the culture it\u0027s perpetuating. That said, the word itself is infantile, idiotic, and meaningless, and makes me want to poke my eyes out with a larding needle. Can\u0027t people just say they love food?Comments (24)Joan GageA Rolling CroneEveryone who was older than, say, five, on November 22, 1963 has a story that begins, \u0027On the day that Kennedy was shot, I...\u0027 Those too young to remember it have filed away Kennedy\u0027s murder in their minds along with other national tragedies: the assassination of President Lincoln, the Hindenburg disaster, Pearl Harbor, the sinking of the Titanic, the San Francisco earthquake.CommentsPaul RieckhoffFounder, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of AmericaSenate gridlock and dysfunction has reared its ugly head again -- and this time it\u0027s survivors of military sexual assault who will pay the price.CommentsAnthony LappéNY-based author, television producer and media commentatorJFK WTF? you say. Well, it\u0027s not as crazy as it sounds. Join me in the way-back machine for a thought experiment in JFK alternate history.Comments (26)Reese SchonfeldTelevision journalistAs I write this, it is 50 years and two hours since I heard five bells ring on the UPI wire, turned around and discovered that John F. Kennedy had been shot.CommentsThomas P. DiNapoli and Anne StausbollIf the world burned all of its fossil fuel reserves, would the world as we know it be the same? The International Energy Agency, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and other reputable groups say that the answer is no. It would tip us into a climate catastrophe.CommentsMichael Friedman, L.M.S.W.Adjunct Associate Professor, Columbia University Schools of Social Work and Public HealthStressful events can bring out the best in us, lift us to levels we never thought possible. We can rise to the occasion. But, it\u0027s not quite that simple, is it?CommentsEric BarryComedian, writer and creator of the \u0027Full Disclosure\u0027 sex podcast and blog.Some people will argue that if these women really mattered, a list wouldn\u0027t be necessary. Most of these people couldn\u0027t tell you the phone number of the person they\u0027re dating, or the birth dates of some of their closest friends, because ya know, they have a list that stores that information.Comments (17)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorWe know that the economy\u0027s been growing and that company profits have been high. There\u0027s nothing wrong with profits, but there\u0027s definitely something wrong when they fail to lead to employment and earnings gains for the broad majority.Comments (134)Jason Landry, 2013.23.11Jeff Rivera, 2013.23.11Jackie K.
