{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Mitchell BardWriterThe U.S. House voted Tuesday to raise the debt ceiling, likely allowing the country to avoid defaulting on its bills as soon as Feb. 27. For the first time since Republicans took control of the House in the 2010 elections, the bill was \"clean,\" which is a euphemism for \"extortion-free.\" That is, there were no spending cuts or other GOP-friendly items tacked on to the legislation. What is striking, though, is that while Republican House Speaker John Boehner brought the bill to the floor and voted for it, only 27 other Republicans in the House voted with him. Let\u0027s let that sink in for a second... 201 of 229 Republicans who voted opted not to raise the debt ceiling.Comments (165)Ann BrenoffSenior Writer, The Huffington PostWe are just seven weeks into 2014 and already I am annoyed, verklempt if you will.

KlareAuthor and Professor of Peace and World-Security Studies, Hampshire CollegeIn recent years, largely thanks to the dampening effects of the Great Recession, U.S. carbon emissions were in decline (though they grew by 2 percent in 2013). Still, whatever the president may claim, we\u0027re not heading toward a \"cleaner, safer planet.\" If anything, we\u0027re heading toward a dirtier, more dangerous world.Comments (15)Nora CothrenCo-Chair, Go!

Do we send a card, text, or email? Do we avoid, ignore, and disregard?

Some point-and-counterpoint is fine. Balance is not, however, the same as objectivity or accuracy -- although it makes a nice, easy, inexpensive stand-in for what might otherwise be a real, difficult, comparatively expensive attempt to report what is actually going on.CommentsTavis SmileyPBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorTonight on PBS, I\u0027m joined by Chiwetel Ejiofor, whose commanding performance as Solomon Northup in 12 Years A Slave earned him an Oscar nomination.

And I was made to feel like I was actually from this planet.Comments (15)Adam GrantWharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027According to conventional wisdom, the best way to boost your salary is to get an offer from a competing employer with a higher salary. But if you\u0027ve already decided where you want to work, and you\u0027re not well along the way with other employers, it\u0027s disingenuous to start interviewing elsewhere, not to mention a waste of your time.CommentsStephanie DandanNomadic photographer and writer at www.infinitesatori.orgWe travel at the cost of sacrifices. We\u0027re happy living with just barely enough as long as we\u0027re on the road. This means that we have given up plenty of comforts for the sake of travel.
