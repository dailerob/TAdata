{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week proved Ebola panic spreads much, much faster than the disease itself -- with the former needing only contact with cable news, talk radio, social media, or political ads to proliferate. But with President Obama appointing an Ebola czar on Friday, we can question our preparedness without legitimizing the fear-mongering. As Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, told HuffPost\u0027s Sam Stein, without a \"10-year slide in research support, we probably would have had a vaccine in time for this that would\u0027ve gone through clinical trials and would have been ready.\" What will it take to put an end to the short-sighted gutting of scientific research in the name of deficit reduction?To effectively address emerging disease threats like Ebola today and other illnesses in the years ahead, a global emergency response plan must be developed and deployed with eight critical components that can be rapidly implemented at the beginning of an outbreak.Public Health Editor, The Huffington Post; Former U.S. Assistant Surgeon GeneralEasy talk about \"boots on the ground\" grates on the senses. It seems an awfully cavalier way to talk about the American battle dead buried at Arlington and in cemeteries across the country.Senior Military Correspondent, The Huffington PostIt used to be thought that America\u0027s greatest strength was not its military power, but an economic system that was the envy of the world. But why would others seek to emulate an economic model by which a large proportion -- even a majority -- of the population has seen their income stagnate while incomes at the top have soared?Professor at Columbia University and a Nobel Laureate in EconomicsDuring off-year elections, too many women stay home when their votes are needed. In the last midterm election, 10 million unmarried women who voted in 2008 did not show up! As a result, conservatives swept to power and eviscerated policies aimed at supporting American women, especially in healthcare.Singer; Actress; Director; Composer; ActivistWe need to redefine wealth as the ability to make a decent living from the land and sustain it for the next generation. To grow crops for food and fuel while simultaneously enriching the soil upon which future crops depend. To support a family and a community.President of Farm AidYou can\u0027t just expect any nurse or any doctor or any health care worker or layperson to understand the deconning procedures by way of some kind of pamphlet or 10-minute training video. Not only is it mentally rigorous, but it\u0027s physically exhausting. Healthcare WriterLet me be as honest as I can be: If white Christians in America were more Christian than white, black parents could feel safer about their children. It\u0027s time for us white Christians to repent -- turn around and go in a new direction.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersFor those of you who are determined that we suffer and be held accountable for our mistakes, we can only say that the pain of knowing how deeply we wronged our son and not being able to sit down across from him and ask for his forgiveness is agony beyond all attempt to describe it.Leader, Local HIV/AIDS Outreach Team Leader \u0026 Affirming Hope LifeGroup at Overlake Christian Church in Redmond, WAAmerica goes to the polls in less than 3 weeks, there\u0027s a lot at stake for the majority of voters -- namely women. Unfortunately women also make up another majority -- those working for our pathetic $7.25 an hour minimum wage.Money Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsAs a Colorado citizen who pays more than ordinary attention to American politics generally and to Colorado politics particularly, I am dumbfounded and appalled by The Denver Post\u0027s endorsement of Congressman Cory Gardner.United States Senator (Ret.)At 9 p.m. on that August night, when I arrived for my first shift as a cocktail waitress at Whispers, one of the two strip clubs in downtown Williston, I didn\u0027t expect a 25-year-old man to get beaten to death outside the joint. Then again, I didn\u0027t really expect most of the things I encountered reporting on the oil boom in western North Dakota this past summer.Author, \u0027A Dream Foreclosed\u0027It is important for everyone to become more savvy about abuser\u0027s excuses because many people unwittingly reinforce them in how we respond to the abuser\u0027s \"explanations\" for his/her violence, and to understand what taking real responsibility means.Psychologist, and Co-Founder and Co-Director of Emerge, an abuser education program and national training center on domestic violenceThe reaction of the economic mainstream to the inflationary turmoil of the 1970s was to retreat to an ideological interpretation of their fundamental ideas -- a doctrinaire reinforcement of laissez-faire economics.Author, \u0027Seven Bad Ideas: How Mainstream Economists Have Damaged America and the World\u0027Western governments, those with the power to do something about Palestinian children\u0027s sorrowful predicament, too often only address Israeli fears while downplaying the horrifying realities faced by Palestinian children.Founding member, lyricist, and principal composer of Pink FloydAs a mom of two sons, I know the majority of men out there are appalled by the terrible epidemic of sexual assault on college campus. These young men are speaking out and standing up as leaders on campus and in their community.We\u0027ve seen amazing traction, and we couldn\u0027t be more thrilled to see the young men who are joining in the conversation about sexual assault through the #iAspire for Her Campaign.Philanthropist, Author, EntrepreneurGeorgia Tech\u0027s Judith Curry has authored an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal claiming that \"there is less urgency to phase out greenhouse gas emissions now\" than in the past. This could not be further from the truth.Director of Penn State Earth System Science Center; Author of \u0027Dire Predictions\u0027 and \u0027The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars\u0027If you want to know what the future would look like under an all-GOP Congress, you need only look at what Republicans have said and done in the past. They will take a meat ax to our nation\u0027s top domestic priorities, including the very public health systems that we rely upon to keep us safe. We cannot let that happen.U.S. Senator from CaliforniaMy new venture in consumer tech and wearables gives me a way to demonstrate and justify why kids should take an interest in STEM education, to walk the walk vs. just talk.Musician, technology advocate, and founder of i.am+This \"perfect storm\" of guns and cyber-stalking of women is an example of how Western culture, through both philosophy and Christian theology, works to normalize violence against women, and violence in the general culture.Professor of Theology, Chicago Theological SeminaryAn increasingly divisive debate is raging among politically engaged Latinos right now over how to respond to our political leaders\u0027 incapacity to reform our immigration system. This should worry politicians in general and Democrats in particular.Editor, Latino VoicesThe Ebola outbreak currently devastating West Africa threatens the lives of not just those infected with the virus, but all who require medical care, whether treatment for malaria or prenatal care for a healthy pregnancy.Kolokotrones University Professor and Chair of the Department of Global Health and Social Medicine, Harvard Medical School; Chief of the Division of Global Health Equity, Brigham and Women’s Hospital; co-founder, Partners In HealthOne of the great tales of Hollywood \"censorship\" remains little known today, more than 67 years after it transpired. And who was right at the center of it? None other than President Harry S. Truman.Author, Blogger, Film ProducerWhile at the food bank, I talked with other volunteers as well as those there to collect food -- an experience that opened my eyes to the faces of hunger in our country. The people in line who needed food were often indistinguishable from the volunteers.ActorI really hope family members of victims of the 9/11 attacks weren\u0027t planning on attending the hearings scheduled at Guantanamo Bay this week. It would be completely demoralizing to someone who suffered personally from the heinous mass murders that took place 13 years ago to find that once again, all efforts to bring the five alleged perpetrators to justice had stalled, and once again, no one\u0027s allowed to know why.Senior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstWe should stop obsessing about test scores and start obsessing about the health and well-being of children and their families. The gains would be far more valuable than a few points on a standardized test.Research Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027We shouldn\u0027t require a horrific epidemic like Ebola to remind us why we observe Global Handwashing Day today. But it seems, alas, many in the world can use a reminder about the importance of good hygiene.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia UniversityDirector, Earth Institute at Columbia UniversityEven when you try to keep the spark burning, it\u0027s a whole different ball game when you\u0027re married with kids. Going on a date, for example, only remotely resembles the dates you USED to go on. Let\u0027s break it down.Writer, wife, and mom to four energetic little boys. Lover of zombies, baking, and science. Blogger at FightingFrumpy.com.Yes, oats are loaded with carbs, but the release of those sugars is slowed by the fiber, and because oats also have 10 grams of protein per 1/2-cup serving, they deliver steady, muscle-friendly energy.The New York Times best-selling author of Eat It to Beat It!, Eat This, Not That and The Abs Diet, and the Nutrition and Wellness Editor at ABC NewsIn today\u0027s world, it seems like the only way to ensure that there is a significant public investment in America\u0027s arts and arts education programs is to ensure that both policymakers and the private sector understand the return on an investment in the arts.CEO of The Creative Coalition and Tina Edmundson, Global Officer, Luxury \u0026 Lifestyle Brands, Marriott International, Inc.In truth, there\u0027s a big part of me that feels truly angry that we are still reading/hearing such negativity and misunderstanding towards breastfeeding in 2014... but there is hope. Because the vast majority saw this photograph for exactly what it is: beautiful.Writer, MamaBeanParenting.comGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"MYSTERY: RUSSIAN SUB IN SWEDISH WATERS?",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
