{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonI\u0027ve just returned from the most amazing place. I\u0027m not talking about Hawaii, where I spent the holidays with my daughters, my sister and my ex-husband -- though it was lovely, and all the more so because of the foot of snow that\u0027s greeted my return to New York. I\u0027m talking about the week I spent unplugged, away from email, social media and TV. Occasionally unplugging from all our devices and techno-distractions is one of those seemingly small adjustments that actually have the power to transform the way we see the world, live our lives and interact with the people who matter most to us. The unplugged version of myself was better able to give these things my full attention -- which, as Daniel Goleman says, is \"a form of love.\" And I was able to remember, to paraphrase Louis C.K., that no device or screen can match the HD quality of the actual world.CommentsRobert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027In the case of the Affordable Care Act, private insurers have priced their policies on the premise that a lot of healthy young people will purchase insurance. If the young don\u0027t participate in large numbers, and older and sicker people do, then insurers will have to raise premium charges for everyone. That will be blamed, rightly or wrongly, on Obamacare.Comments (151)Matthew HarringtonMatthew Harrington is Edelman’s global chief operating officer.As 2014 gets underway, something profound is afoot among some of the world\u0027s largest brands. They are doing things differently and challenging the status quo. Rather than being daunted by the prospect of change, they have the courage to embrace it, which I would argue is setting them up for a more successful future.CommentsBarbra StreisandSinger; Actress; Director; Composer; ActivistIf you wonder why Republicans really undermine the ACA daily, maybe they are worried about its eventual success. Remember the GOP also largely opposed Medicare.Comments (176)Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoWe do not hesitate to make phone calls because of the infinitesimal risk that the government might be using a pen register to track our calls. Modern technology has changed this completely. Today, the government can collect and store data on all of our telephone calls.CommentsMohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOI am a believer in the role of incentives in an economy, including how badly-aligned incentives can result in sub-optimal outcomes. But I find it hard to make the case here given the evidence on the extent and duration of long-term unemployment.Comments (49)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, Beyond OutrageOne of the worst epithets that can be leveled at a politician these days is to call him a \"redistributionist.\" Yet 2013 marked one of the biggest redistributions in recent American history. It was a redistribution upward, from average working people to the owners of America.Comments (112)Matt WalshBlogger, talk radio host, father of twinsNow, to speak directly to a certain terrifying subset of this species. These are the lowest, most shameless sorts of customers. Their existence is a constant, chilling reminder that evil exists in the world. They are the non-tippers.Comments (145)Wendy FontaineWriter, MotherTo celebrate my passage into this fourth decade, here\u0027s a list of 40 things I can do now that I couldn\u0027t do then.Comments (133)Nadia TolokonnikovaActivist, Pussy Riot band member\u0027They beat you once, then may come grab your hair, hit your head on the sewing machine or take you into a punishment cell, there they kick you using hands, legs, or remove the belt from a sewing machine and thrash you with it.\u0027Comments (21)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action Networkhen issues like women\u0027s reproductive rights, unemployment benefits, marriage equality, economic fairness, education, immigration reform, a minimum wage increase and affordable health care are on the line, how can anyone think that making promises or a new year\u0027s resolution is enough?CommentsBernard-Henri LévyFrench philosopher and writerA Europe ashamed and disgraced, a Europe discounted, a Europe in name but not in deed, a Europe afraid of its own shadow -- that\u0027s a sure path to decline for all of the nations that make it up. On this point, the outcome of the next elections will be critical.Comments (27)Russell SimmonsFounder, GlobalGrind.comI certainly had my fair share of differences, both publicly and privately, with Mayor Bloomberg. But, through it all, I remained a loyal supporter, because I respected his independence and I knew his heart was in the right place.CommentsEzra PriorWriterReading Letters, a collection of Kurt Vonnegut\u0027s letters, edited by Dan Wakefield, allowed me to connect with my grandfather by pretending that I was their recipient. Though he\u0027s a legend, his image became tattered through reading his words.CommentsRana FloridaCEO, The Creative Class Group \u0026 Author, UpgradeIn this New Year, we need to change our diets and the ways we think about and consume food. But to get there, it has to be a community effort. Here are 10 ways we can all work together to create a fitter, healthier society.CommentsBill MoyersManaging Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyFirst it was Wisconsin. Now it\u0027s North Carolina that is redefining the term \"battleground state.\" On one side: a right wing government enacting laws that are changing the face of the state. On the other: citizen protesters who are fighting back against what they fear is a radical takeover.CommentsDr. Reese HalterBroadcaster, Conservation Biologist, EducatorThe Arctic is warming at least two times faster than the rest of our planet. It\u0027s not just the loss of the white surface, which reflects solar radiation back to space and helps keep Earth at a habitable temperature range for our species that is a concern.Comments (42)Michael BrennerSenior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghThe militarization of American foreign policy is an accomplished fact. \"Security\" is the term used promiscuously to characterize whatever challenges to the nation\u0027s well-being are out there -- or perceived as existing.CommentsWendell PotterAuthor, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgReform advocates have long suggested that getting folks out of the ranks of the uninsured should cut down on visits to the ER for noncritical medical care. An Oregon study, which was published in the journal Science, would seem to disprove that theory.CommentsRoger HickeyCo-Director, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureConservative populism becomes most powerful, as we saw in the last mid-term election in 2010, when liberal politicians ignore the fundamental nature of the economic crisis and leave the field to conservatives on the issue that voters care most about: jobs.Comments (37)James ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027There was another dimension of ABSCAM which \"American Hustle\" doesn\u0027t consider and media reviews have ignored and that is the impact ABSCAM had on Arab Americans.Comments (18)James P. HoffaGeneral President, International Brotherhood of TeamstersCongress will kick off 2014 by likely considering legislation that would allow bum trade deals to speed through Capitol Hill with little debate and no amendments. The Teamsters and others have been vocal on what a bad idea that would be. And it isn\u0027t hard to prove why.CommentsRep. Alan GraysonU.S. Congressman for Florida\u0027s 9th DistrictSo it may seem that the Republicans are doing nothing about nothing. But they\u0027re actually doing nothing about everything. Whatever the problems we face, their infantile solution is always the same: close your eyes, and it will go away.Comments (167)Victor StengerPhysicist, PhD, bestselling authorEven if controlled fusion is still a long way from reaching fruition, nuclear energy remains the best and perhaps the only long-term, large-scale solution to the world\u0027s energy needs.Comments (16)Tom EngelhardtEditor, TomDispatch.comIn bang-for-the-buck practical terms, Washington\u0027s national security state should be viewed as a remarkable failure. And yet, in faith-based terms, it couldn\u0027t be a greater success. Its false gods are largely accepted by acclamation and regularly worshiped in Washington and beyond.CommentsAngelina ChapinBlogs Editor, Huffington Post CanadaSexually fluid is a category more and more women fall under -- there\u0027s a reason Katy Perry\u0027s \"I Kissed A Girl\" was a No. 1 hit for seven weeks. But Justin Timberlake has yet to release \"I Kissed a Boy.\" Why aren\u0027t men as eager to go with the sexual flow?Comments (32)Norm Stamper34-year veteran police officer who retired as Seattle\u0027s chief of police in 2000New York\u0027s new mayor made clear from the beginning that he would put an end to NYPD\u0027s aggressive \"stop and frisk\" policies. So, what does he do? He turns around and appoints a police commissioner who, under Rudy Giuliani, ushered in that very same stop and frisk mentality.CommentsAllison HopePR specialist and journalistI\u0027ll sit here and yell aloud in my living room for any number of celebrities that I\u0027m sure are gay to come out. But as a responsible journalist, I won\u0027t publish evidence that doesn\u0027t fully add up about someone\u0027s personal identity no matter how vile they might be.Comments (79)Paul AbramsLast person on Earth not on FacebookToday, the working poor receive $3-7 Billion in federal assistance. The real number is probably higher than that, but the savings from raising the minimum wage is not likely to be 100 percent. So, let us call it $5 Billion.Comments (29)Debbie MatzChairman of the Board, National Credit Union AdministrationTo see a television advertisement for a business offering payday loans is to see payday loans advertised as a lifeline: a way for a financially strapped family to cover an unexpected expense. But that\u0027s not actually how most payday loans are used.CommentsEdward M. WeinmanWriter, author\u0027Shitwa!\u0027 The word was a polite way to curse so as not to teach her 12 children epithets that they might repeat in school or in a public place, like a grocery store. Yes, my mother had 12 kids.CommentsDr. Lisa YoungNationally-recognized nutritionist; Adjunct professor of nutrition at NYU; Author, \u0027The Portion Teller Plan\u0027What I have found in my private practice is that small action-oriented steps and simple substitutions tend to work a lot better. Here are some smart-and simple food swaps that you can actually implement and incorporate into your everyday routine to help you lead a healthier life.Comments (57)Sen.
