{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Peter S. GoodmanExecutive Business Editor, The Huffington PostThose jobs that President Barack Obama just touted Tuesday afternoon in Chattanooga, Tenn., are literally beyond reach of most of the people who might fill them. The president visited an Amazon warehouse on the city\u0027s industrial periphery to spotlight a hopeful surge in recent hiring, part of his campaign to urge job creation as the fix for middle class decline. But the first part of landing a job is getting to the workplace. Getting to the Amazon warehouse is a formidable challenge for anyone lacking a car: The Chattanooga bus system doesn\u0027t go there. This disconnect between available jobs and the public transit system is a problem across many major American cities. It is a problem normally discussed in isolation, as if public transportation were some sort feel-good, clean air-generating pursuit for endangered species-loving people who eat wheat grass. In reality, our shortage of public transportation represents a full-blown crisis at the center of the explanation for how millions of Americans have found themselves exiled from working life.Comments (334)Arianna HuffingtonWhy are we taking the conversation international? Because, while creation of the faulty definition of success definitely had significant help from the U.S., it\u0027s clear this is now a global phenomenon.Comments (124)Charu AdesnikManager, Economic Empowerment Investment Portfolio, Cisco and Cisco FoundationLet\u0027s put this into perspective: When we talk about underserved populations in developing countries, we are talking about people who are living on less than $3 a day. They may have never had a formal job and most likely have, at most, a high school education. They don\u0027t have a bank account, they may live in a slum, and they may not have enough money to eat three meals a day.CommentsMichael MooreOscar- and Emmy-winning directorToday Bradley Manning was convicted on 20 of 22 counts, including violating the Espionage Act, releasing classified information and disobeying orders. That\u0027s the bad news. The good news is he was found not guilty on the charge of \"aiding the enemy.\" That\u0027s \u0027cause who he was aiding was us, the American people. And we\u0027re not the enemy. Right?CommentsBianca BoskerExecutive Tech Editor, The Huffington PostIn contrast to an earlier generation that experimented with spouse-swapping, group sex and free-love communes in the 1960s and \u002770s, today\u0027s online generation is embracing sex with no one.Comments (26)Zinnia JonesOrlando-based atheist activist, parent, and video bloggerSomewhere, in some other universe, I might have been able to stop all of this -- or I might have ended up in a cell, too.Comments (66)John GlaserEditor at Antiwar.comDid Manning break the law? According to the letter, yes he did. But since when did we presume to hold people in government accountable to the law?CommentsAlan ColmesLiberal political commentator, host of \"The Alan Colmes Show\" on Fox News Radio, publisher of alan.com, author of \"Thank the Liberals … For Saving America\"Seeing liberal bloggers declare victory about how a boycott of these shows\u0027 sponsors led to this makes my hair stand on end for four reasons. First, that\u0027s not at all what happened, as these shows will land elsewhere.Comments (113)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureSure, they still need scapegoats they can indict instead of Wall Street executives. But America doesn\u0027t want to see television\u0027s too-good-to-be-true housewife take the fall anymore -- not when it can get a caricaturishly bad one instead. Enter Teresa and Joe Guidice, our newest celebrity defendants.CommentsJill KnappAdjunct Professor in Psychology, AuthorBefore I was married, I experienced a lot of these signs from many unattainable men. Men that made me think if I just stuck it out, they would end up becoming my boyfriend.CommentsBrian PennyWhistleblower, Anon Supporter, Writer, ConsultantIf Bradley Manning is guilty of espionage, what does that mean for me? Am I guilty of espionage against Bank of America, QBE, and Assurant? Are all whistleblowers spies? What\u0027s the difference between a whistleblower and a spy? What could he have done better?Comments (37)Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOIt is tempting for lawmakers to ignore the seemingly endless flow of economic data releases, especially as they prepare to take their summer recess. But, please, not this week.Comments (49)Norman SolomonAuthor, \u0027War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death\u0027No verdict handed down by the military judge can change the moral verdict that has emerged from people all over the world, reciprocating what Bradley Manning expressed online a few days before his arrest: \"I can\u0027t separate myself from others.\"Comments (120)Scott PaulPresident, Alliance for American ManufacturingThe President will be speaking about rebuilding America\u0027s middle class from the depths of an Amazon warehouse in Tennessee. His message and the site from which he\u0027ll deliver it are dissonant, given Amazon\u0027s prominence as a massive importer and employer of temporary workers.Comments (131)David GalensonProfessor of Economics, University of ChicagoAll art is allusive, connected more or less visibly with earlier works of art. But in the modern era a number of artists have gone beyond earlier uses of allusion, in not only referring to other works, but quoting them precisely, and doing so with a frequency that exceeds earlier practice.CommentsGreta Van SusterenHost, Fox News\u0027 \u0027On the Record With Greta Van Susteren\u0027If someone has something to say about Abedin, that person should have the courage to step up and put his or her name on it.Comments (12)Sarah Koppelkamhopeave.wordpress.comHow to talk to your daughter about her body, step one: Don\u0027t talk to your daughter about her body, except to teach her how it works. Don\u0027t say anything if she\u0027s lost weight. Don\u0027t say anything if she\u0027s gained weight. Here are some things you can say instead.CommentsZaki HasanMedia Scholar and Critic, zakiscorner.comWhat really sticks out to me in all the commentary is the inherent idiocy of Green\u0027s central (read: only) assertion: that Aslan\u0027s \"Muslim-ness\" somehow disqualifies him from writing about Jesus.Comments (238)Anca DumitruFreelance writer, blogger and marketerI\u0027d been ignoring my symptoms for quite a while: I could no longer focus, I was exhausted, demotivated and unproductive. The closer I would get to my office building every morning, the more I\u0027d become nauseous at the thought of having to go through the same routine all over again.Comments (27)Carlos CabreraManufacturer of quality, affordable jokes and sketches since 2004.For comedians, a wrestling persona facilitates this shocking, more entertaining version of yourself, like what Stephen Colbert does every night.CommentsLacey HaynesYoga Teacher | Writer | Founder of www.theyogaemporium.comDare I say it: eating a pork chop is the same as eating your cat. All animals\u0027 lives matter and when someone says, \"I love animals\" while eating a hamburger, there\u0027s just too much disassociation there for me to bear.Comments (246)Joseph A. PalermoProfessor, historian, authorMitch Daniels\u0027s attempt to erase Zinn from the Indiana curriculum unveils him as an anti-intellectual who is clueless about the discipline of History as well as the historical profession.Comments (70)Derek FloodAuthor, \u0027Healing the Gospel\u0027Now, I\u0027m a big fan of Jim Wallis and I appreciate that he moved the conversation away from Maher\u0027s attempted divisiveness and back to caring for the poor and immigration reform in this country. At the same time, I think the question Bill Maher was raising is an important one, too.Comments (18)Jason WhitlockColumnist, FOXSports.comThe uniqueness of the black American experience and the side effects of that experience are not difficult to relate to, convey or understand. It\u0027s just that most pundits and broadcasters are far too lazy, scared and convinced of viewer ignorance to go beyond simple-minded, attention-grabbing sound bites.Comments (575)Geoffrey DunnAuthor, \u0027The Lies of Sarah Palin\u0027Banned from attacking Ayers?

BlumenfeldAssociate Professor, School of Education, Iowa State UniversityWe are \"gravely disordered,\" \"afflicted with evil tendencies,\" our relationships constitute a \"troubling moral and social phenomenon,\" and \"a destruction of God\u0027s work,\" which \"threatens human dignity and the future of humanity itself,\" but the Church somehow deeply respects us?CommentsSec. Kathleen SebeliusSecretary of Health and Human ServicesMedicaid expansion is a critical piece of the puzzle to ensure more Americans get the care they need. Expanding Medicaid also reduces the burden of uncompensated care. It injects significant resources into your local economies and local hospitals.CommentsSara RochfordModeration Manager, The Huffington PostHuffPost Community staff members are being sent into the heart of the community with a mission: to bring you closer to the content creators and decision makers at HuffPost, highlight the best conversations, and engage you in positive and open exchange.Comments (28)Lincee RayTV enthusiastBut it was the final 45 minutes of the show that culminated into what is probably the most drawn out on-camera break up in the history of the world. Instead of an exotic date, her drags Des over to a bench and proceeds to gently tell her that he\u0027s just not that into her.Comments (15)Cameron BlazerAssistant federal public defender, adjunct professorWe can all point to watershed moments in the histories of our countries, of our world--even when huge groups of people joined in shared, raw feeling for a moment in time. It is what we do in those moments--whether we turn that potential energy into kinetic forward progress or let it scatter into reactive chaos--that often defines us for all the moments that follow.Comments (12)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027It may be politically popular to yell about deficits being bad, but political popularity cannot change arithmetic. If President Obama wants to boost the economy, he will need to get more government spending to put people back to work, which will mean larger deficits.Comments (196)Paul Szep, 2013.30.07Richard (RJ) Eskow, 2013.30.07Brad Friedman and Desi Doyen, 2013.30.07Nadia Cho, 2013.30.07Rick Steves, 2013.30.07Warren J.
