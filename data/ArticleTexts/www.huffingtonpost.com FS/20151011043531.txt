{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, as Joe Biden inched closer to jumping into the presidential race, Ben Carson inched closer to forcing us to retire the use of \"brain surgeon\" as a linguistic stand-in for \"brilliant genius,\" with thunderingly dumb comments about guns, the Umpqua Community College shooting, and the Holocaust. Meanwhile, Congressional Republicans took on the trappings of a badly written soap opera, with Kevin McCarthy abruptly withdrawing from contention as the next Speaker due to opposition from Tea Partiers who didn\u0027t find him conservative enough -- or was it really because of those rumors of a steamy extramarital affair with a colleague? Tune in next time for \"As the GOP Turns\"... Is it any surprise that neither John Boehner nor Paul Ryan wants a position that has gone from someone who can get things done to someone who promises to stop all things from getting done? Welcome to today\u0027s Washington.Suppose we arm everyone -- do we really want to live in that kind of country and raise our children there? Or send our children to college on those campuses, as I will do for the first time next fall?Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersTwo weeks ago, America\u0027s first \"honest politician\" Gil Fulbright announced his bid for the White House. Fulbright is a satirical candidate cashing in on the flood of money in politics by doing whatever his donors want.Director, Represent.UsGoing through such a seismic, existential shift in my life? -- ?transitioning in a military prison -- presents real, meaningful, and daily challenges.Former U.S. Army intelligence analyst, military whistleblower and democracy advocateCorporate America is drowning in meetings. To make one thing clear, I am not against communication. Quick one-on-ones can be extremely effective. I am talking about those hour-long recurring meetings, devoid of a clear agenda, and attended by many.CEO of Udacity and a research professor at StanfordFrom my earliest recollections, adults, when first meeting me, would invariably ask the question, \"Do you know who your father is?\" The query came from musicians and fans alike. I didn\u0027t really understand the question at first, because the answer seemed so obvious.Internationally acclaimed jazz drummer, composer, bandleader, and vocalistI would announce that my Attorney General would prosecute HUMANS (meaning corporate executives) for corporate criminal conduct. Humans commit crimes.Host, Fox News\u0027 \u0027On the Record With Greta Van Susteren\u0027The crude nature of the Pentagon\u0027s blatant anti-Russian propaganda campaign following the Russian cruise missile attack inside Syria only underscores the difficult position the Russian missile attacks have placed the United States, both regionally and globally.Author, \u0027Dangerous Ground\u0027In between the lines of the glossy pages touched with the Kardashian spell, the Obamas have been blurred out for a family that has not used their stan-factor to offer any substantial social impact in this country.Graduate student, Columbia University Journalism School and Music and Culture writerMost striking in the presidential campaign right now is the extent to which all of the major Democratic candidates have endorsed populist economic and political reforms. All three leading candidates have plans to raise taxes on the rich, crack down on corporate tax havens and loopholes, and limit capital gains tax breaks for investors.President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureI feel like I\u0027m about to witness a heinous car crash, and even throwing myself on the painted lines in the middle of the road wouldn\u0027t stop it.Author, English teacher and mother of threeWith a stroke of his pen, President Obama can help address one particularly troubling area of dark money spending in elections. He can issue an Executive Order requiring major companies that are awarded federal contracts to disclose all of their political donations.President of the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of LawAll empires fail and eventually devour themselves. The U.S. empire is no different. Not repeatedly doing what has failed is the first step toward correction. How much better and cheaper it would be if years ago we became a humanitarian power -- well-received by the deprived billions in these anguished lands.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorI have no doubt that Dr. Carson is a fantastic surgeon, and I highly encourage him to keep doing what he\u0027s good at, what made him famous, what made him loved and what kept him far too busy--presumably and understandably--to read the United States Constitution.Author, Attorney, Activist, UN Global ExpertInterfaith gatherings occur around the country, often in very simple and beautiful ways, but when we need to mobilize against bigotry, how well equipped are we? Where is our rapid response? Where is the determination to stand up every time someone uses religious identity as an excuse to hate?Executive Editor Of Global Spirituality and Religion, The Huffington PostGiant Wall Street banks continue to threaten the well-being of millions of Americans, but what to do? Bernie Sanders says break them up and resurrect the Glass-Steagall Act that once separated investment from commercial banking. Hillary Clinton says charge them a bit more and oversee them more carefully. Most Republicans say don\u0027t worry.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Jobs that involve people skills but don\u0027t require prolonged educations should rise in status. Perhaps the cafes of the future will feature highly paid waiters serving lattes to impoverished lawyers.Author, The Sceptical Optimist: Why Technology Isn\u0027t the Answer to EverythingChances are you don\u0027t even know that you are holy, or royal or magic, but you are. You are part of an adoptive family going back through every generation of human existence.Founder and Director of QuistThe TPP is also a profoundly anti-democratic agreement which signs away our right to govern our own economy. Despite being nominally a \"trade\" agreement, it contains provisions which interfere with areas well beyond the bounds of trade.Author, \u0027Free Trade Doesn\u0027t Work: What Should Replace It and Why\u0027I can cite facts and figures all day long depicting the disparity in which different communities are policed, who gets stopped, who gets frisked, who gets arrested, who can afford an attorney and what actual crime rates are broken down by various categories including race and ethnicity. Bottom line is, our criminal justice system is unbalanced, broken and in need of immediate repair.President, National Action NetworkYes, we need strict gun control laws, a deeper understanding of the role of media and better mental illness treatment. However, what we really need, central to all of those dimensions, is a public conversation about hegemonic masculinity in the United States.Feminist, writer, and satirist (not always in that order)Once again this year many schools will pause to commemorate Christopher Columbus. Given everything we know about who Columbus was and what he launched in the Americas, this needs to stop.Co-director, Zinn Education Project; Curriculum editor, Rethinking SchoolsThe shame of being divorced twice before 30 drained my will to live.Writer, crafter, sometimes lawyer, aspiring vegetarian, nature lover, hopeful hippie, Progressive, introvert, hiker, anxiety warriorIf you care about the future of education in the U.S. then the Republican Presidential debates have been a massive disappointment. The problem is that the candidates all believe the same thing, so there is nothing to debate. In fact, through two debates, education has only come up once.Political blogger, Detroit NewsI want you to learn at a very early age to be comfortable talking about your anxieties, struggles and fears. Most importantly, I hope these eight things help you live an authentic life with the understanding that you\u0027re never alone.Lifestyle Blog Editor, The Huffington PostThe Supreme Court began its fall term this week. This seems like a good time to pause for a moment and revisit how decisions by Chief Justice John Roberts and four of his Supreme Court colleagues during the past five years have given the nation a system of legalized bribery.President, Democracy 21Ernie Hollander and his family arrived at Auschwitz in 1944. He was seventeen years old and on his coat he wore a large yellow Star of David. His mother had sewn it there for him. Ernie and his family had traveled three days by train without food in a crowded cattle car from Iloshvo, a town in the Carpathian Mountains in what was then Hungary.AuthorThe number of Russians now living below the poverty line is increasing in tandem with the number of Russian air strikes in Syria. Moscow is financing its military buildup and operations through cuts to the already woefully underfunded sectors of education, health care and infrastructure.Russian State Duma deputy from 1993 to 2007; political analystI greet claims that the TPP will boost American growth and jobs with a healthy dose of skepticism. We already trade pretty freely with most of these countries, and tariffs are low enough already that taking them down further will yield marginal, non-measurable gains.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorFamily historians tracing black family ancestries love wills and probate records. Why? Because these seemingly dry and bloodless documents are full of priceless information about our enslaved African American ancestors.Alphonse Fletcher University Professor and Director of the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research at Harvard UniversityGenealogist, Ancestry.comIf I could sum up the era of my life in which I was discovering my sexuality in one word, that word would be: shame. Despite the personal nature of this story, I feel compelled to share it, because I fully believe that no young woman should have to experience such intense shame -- yet the sad truth is, most do.Writer, musician, lover of life.Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
