{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Did you hear the news? Apparently the 2012 election isn\u0027t going to be about the economy after all. Instead, in the words of an AP headline, \"Social Issues Retake U.S. Politics, 2012 Elections.\" The catalyst for this reorientation of the election was the rule announced by the Obama administration that employers must provide free coverage in their health insurance plans for contraception. This, we\u0027re told, provoked a \"firestorm\" across the political landscape, as pundits across the ideological spectrum warned the White House of pending disaster if it continued to pursue such a divisive, controversial and incendiary path. President Obama\u0027s entire reelection effort was now in jeopardy -- if not already hopelessly lost -- due to Birth Contracalypse 2012. To which I say, Seriously? This supposed \"culture war\" may have captured the fevered imagination of the press corps, but not the electorate -- 71 percent of which still says the economy is the most important problem facing America.Read Post | CommentsGlenn W.
