{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week, Karl Rove suggested that Hillary Clinton might have suffered brain damage in 2012 when she was hospitalized after a fall that left her with a concussion. \"Please assure Dr. Rove she\u0027s 100 percent,\" said a Clinton spokesman. Though Rove was obviously warming up his throat for the aria of sleaze that is sure to be sung in 2016, his talk of a candidate\u0027s health will hopefully open a wider debate -- though not the one Rove wants. Washington is a town fueled by burnout and overwork, and we now know from science the negative impact that approach to life has on decision-making -- which is clearly the main skill a president needs. No one seriously doubts Clinton\u0027s brilliance, but the kind of lives we lead govern whether we have access to our wisdom and best judgment. Rove\u0027s provocation aside, the public would be well-served if questions about how candidates plan to avoid burnout become a legitimate part of our political conversation.Since 2003, we have been a country famous for not merely the occasional war, dedicated to the destruction of an enemy by air power (as in Vietnam) or by a proxy army on the ground (as in Nicaragua).David BromwichProfessor of Literature, Yale UniversityThis week I read that over 40 members of congress are trying to weaken the school lunch laws even more.
