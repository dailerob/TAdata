{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersThe facts of the case really don\u0027t matter anymore, just the feelings and beliefs of the defendant. And when you add the race of the victims into the mix, the disparities in how the law is applied are clear. Basically, if a white man feels or believes he is threatened, regardless of the facts of the case, he can be justified in shooting and killing a black man. The reality of Stand Your Ground laws in Florida and 24 more states is that racial fear and hatred is now legally justified. Black men are always at risk -- as every black parent in this country has told their young boys and as the statistics now bear out.Comments (248)Adam GrantWharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027I\u0027ve noticed that despite growing social and professional acceptance, introverts are still wildly misunderstood. People may be more open about being introverts, but they cling to assumptions that don\u0027t stand up to the test of rigorous evidence. It\u0027s time to debunk five myths.Comments (24)Bernard-Henri LévyFrench philosopher and writerPeople of Maidan, you have a dream that unites you. Your dream is Europe. Not the Europe of accountants, but the Europe of values. Not the Europe of bureaucrats, but that of the spirit.CommentsCraig GieseckeChef, writer and former journalistThese days I find myself in my 60th year, living with my in-laws in Southern California as if I am a just-graduated 20-something, leafing through Craigslist and other sites looking for a job. The most frequent word I hear in job interviews is \"overqualified.\" Wait a minute.Comments (101)Valerie AlexanderAuthor, \u0027Happiness as a Second Language\u0027The natural assumption would be that gold medalists are the happiest, followed by silver, then bronze, but it turns out, bronze medalists are significantly happier than silver medalists. Significantly.CommentsRalph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorBoth sides of the aisle are spinning the report, creating a fog around minimum wage policy that may further discourage a Walmart-influenced Congress from taking any action. Given the miserly state of the minimum wage today, such a can\u0027t-do attitude is unacceptable.CommentsJonathan GhellerProduct manager, FacebookI don\u0027t know if the timing or the content of these protests is optimal but I do know that Venezuela is run by thugs and that people should fight to get rule of law and a basic respect for life back.CommentsRichard (RJ) EskowSenior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host, Take Action NewsWhy has our political discourse become a political Theater of the Absurd in which the preternaturally uninformed Marco Rubio can proclaim, without perceptible embarrassment, that the stimulus \"clearly failed\"?Comments (49)Brian ShactmanAnchor and reporter for MSNBCRussian President Vladimir Putin is apparently winning the war: Safe Olympics (so far), leading the medal count and even journalists have stopped complaining about unfinished rooms and brown water. But he\u0027s lost the battle. Big time.CommentsKarolina SzczurDesigner, developer and photographerDuring eight years of my career I have worked at more than ten product-oriented companies or agencies -- and I\u0027ve also had dozens of clients when freelancing. Some of those jobs were terrible, some of them were OK, but almost none made me happy. Up until now.CommentsMohamed Nasheed and José Ramos-HortaFrom small island states to delta settlements, Asia is the climate frontline. Seven of the ten countries most vulnerable to climate change are in Asia and the Pacific. It falls to Asian governments, whose primary responsibility is to protect their citizens, to respond.CommentsJohn KinnearAuthor of AskYourDadBlog.comI will love her AND be mad at her. I will know that this may not be the right thing to do, but it is the best way I know how to do it at that moment.Comments (17)Mike WeisserMike the Gun GuyWe can talk and argue all we want about whether Americans are safer if everyone walks around with a gun. But somehow, don\u0027t ask me how, too many of us just can\u0027t seem to walk away from a fight.Comments (56)Michael BrennerSenior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghA president whose tenure in office is best known for indecision, temporizing and vacillation has been relentless since day one in using the powers of his office to advance the cause.Comments (376)Michael BociurkiwWriter, journalist, aid worker, speakerThere is troubling disarray, a sort of diplomatic paralysis, among western governments\u0027 policies towards the corrupt regime of President Viktor Yanukovych -- the thug from eastern Ukraine who appears ready to stop at nothing to retain power.Comments (14)Andy BellattiRegistered dietitian; Strategic Director of Dietitians For Professional IntegrityThe real danger here is that the food industry knows exactly how to sweet-talk health professionals -- and their respective organizations -- into joining their ranks in order to be \"part of the solution.\"CommentsCarina KolodnySr. Editor for Special Projects, The Huffington PostWould you go without your phone so that somebody else doesn\u0027t have to go without water? UNICEF\u0027s newest fundraising endeavor forces each and every one of us to answer just that.CommentsWray HerbertAuthor, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027Why would those who intentionally but irrationally put things off, who don\u0027t seem pressured by time -- why would these same people also tend to make rash decisions, without thought or planning? Procrastination and impulsivity are the odd couple of the human mind.CommentsMolly FoscoEntertainment BloggerThere are so many things that are making this season amazing, but I\u0027ve recently realized that those same things are also making it my least favorite season of the three. These are a few choice story lines that are simultaneously the best and worst parts of this season so far.CommentsUnveiling Afghanistan“The Unheard Voices of Progress” is a campaign by openasia.org and fidh.orgThe greatest achievement in Afghanistan is the triumph of a free media.CommentsReza MarashiResearch Director, National Iranian American CouncilSo, now the hard part begins. It is fair to point out that the gap between technical solutions and political solutions may be too wide to bridge. However, the likely alternative -- war -- is a stark reminder for both sides that the status quo is neither in their interests nor sustainable.Comments (17)Evelyn LeopoldVeteran journalist reporting from the United NationsMurder, enslavement, torture, rape, and enforced disappearance are just a few of the \"unspeakable atrocities\" cataloged in an unprecedented U.N. report on North Korea. In short, you can control 25 million people if you kill, maim and imprison enough of them. And if your neighbor, in this case China, cuts off escape routes.Comments (21)Scott WooledgeWriter and activistAlthough McDonald\u0027s has abandoned the #CheersToSochi hashtag, the Cheers to Sochi campaign website is still up and functioning and, according to their press and social media updates, still a conduit to talk to Olympic athletes and teams behind Putin\u0027s Lavender Curtain.CommentsLisa WadeProfessor of sociology based in Los AngelesResearch found that Stand Your Ground laws increase the likelihood that a homicide will be considered \"justified,\" but only in cases where a white person is accused of killing a black person.Comments (160)Clara LieuAuthor; visual artist; adjunct professor, Rhode Island School of DesignMany students are pleasantly surprised by the way that these requirements can stimulate creativity and ideas. I give one assignment called \"Routine\", in which students are asked to create a drawing based on one of their routines. Hopelessly addicted to chocolate pudding, one student depicted an exaggerated tower of empty pudding cups while another student visually represented flashbacks of his mother\u0027s death from cancer.CommentsRev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkWhether it is Florida or any of the other 22 states with these ridiculous and incomprehensible laws on the books, we must push back aggressively and immediately.Comments (253)Valerie JarrettSenior Advisor to the President and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsWhat was clear in this meeting was that many of the goals the president set forth in his State of the Union address\u003c will become reality because of the strong partnerships that he and his administration have forged with leaders from the civil rights community who work hard every day to advocate equality and opportunity for all.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThe idea would be to require chips in weapons that would essentially shut the firearm off in say, schools or movie theaters.Comments (47)Alan SingerSocial studies educator, Hofstra UniversityIf enVisionMATH is adopted nationally, how much money does Pearson stand to make? And is this program even effective?CommentsIngrid NewkirkPresident and co-founder, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA)Never preachy, the film simply lays bare the facts and lets viewers interpret them. It\u0027s the same strategy that animal rights organizations have used for years: Give people the information, and let them decide. And it\u0027s working.Comments (33)Steve LangtonAmerican bobsledderI don\u0027t really listen to music while I\u0027m warming up to compete, as I like taking in the sounds and the scenes on race day. I do, however, blast music with my teammates as we\u0027re getting ready to leave for our venue.CommentsMichelle Renee, 2014.19.02David Finkle, 2014.19.02GlassCeiling.com, 2014.19.02Liquor.com, 2014.19.02Liquor.com, 2014.19.02Warren J.
