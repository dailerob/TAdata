What you need to do is talk to someone who is a refugee. You need to understand this problem for yourself.\"Actor and ProducerThe world is in the midst of a new industrial revolution. Fortune\u0027s Geoff Colvin has a fascinating piece that lays out what this means for modern companies. But for the time-pressed, here are my six big takeaways.Editor, Fortune magazineMy oldest son is 16 and his life does not need to be threatened when he takes his date out for dinner.
