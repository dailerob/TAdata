{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Since last week\u0027s launch, HuffPost Live has been lauded as \"courageous,\" \"rocking,\" \"a game changer,\" and \"the future.\" A number of reviews focused on the wide variety of programming on the network. In the words of Fast Company\u0027s Lauren Kirchner, who watched HuffPost Live for 12 hours straight: \"I haven\u0027t seen a single story repeat all day... [HuffPost Live] never stays on one long enough to get boring.\" Among my favorite moments from last week were appearances by Bill Maher and Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and segments on Chicago\u0027s soaring murder rate, sexual assaults in the military, the ascent of jerks, Kanye West\u0027s use of the word \"bitch,\" and one of my favorite subjects -- unplugging and recharging. We\u0027ve been particularly pleased by the way you have embraced our invitation to join the conversation. Over 400 members of the HuffPost community have already appeared as guests. It\u0027s smart, it\u0027s fun, it\u0027s yours.

Let me try to explain to you what that does to the minds, hearts and souls of the millions of women on this planet who experience rape. It is a form of re-rape.Read Post | CommentsRobert Reich, 08/20/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Mitt Romney hasn\u0027t provided details so we should be grateful he\u0027s selected as vice president a man with a detailed plan Romney says is \"marvelous,\" \"bold and exciting,\" \"excellent,\" \"much needed,\" and \"consistent with\" what he\u0027s put out. So let\u0027s look at the five basic features of this \"marvelous\" Ryan plan.Read Post | Comments (22)Howard Fineman, 08/20/12Editorial Director, AOL Huffington Post Media GroupAt the Huffington Post we report minute by minute, but sometimes the best way to cover the news is to get some distance from it. Today we offer another rather less lofty effort at explanatory distance. We\u0027re calling it the HuffPost List.Read Post | CommentsSoraya Chemaly, 08/20/12Feminist, Satirist and Media CriticWhat Todd Akin said and believes doesn\u0027t just play into a media-catchy, election year \"war on women\" narrative. It\u0027s part of a reactionary, fundamentalist backlash to modernity. It\u0027s a war on science. It\u0027s a war on facts. It\u0027s a war on critical thinking.Read Post | Comments (93)Robert Kuttner, 08/19/12Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Do most Americans really want to voucherize Medicare and privatize Social Security? Do we want drastic cuts in what\u0027s left of other social supports in order to give even larger tax cuts to millionaires? Most polls suggest not, and bumper stickers have already been appearing: Save Medicare, vote Democratic.Read Post | Comments (340)Alan Schroeder, 08/18/12Professor of Journalism, Northeastern UniversityWhy must debate moderators always be Washington TV journalists? They\u0027re trained to ask questions and probe evasions, but do they focus on the right topics? The lack of diversity is best measured not by ancestry or gender, but by life experience.Read Post | Comments (147)Deborah Gaines, 08/20/12Inveterate babblerFinding new sexual partners will not be a problem. As it happens, the UPS man is right: sex is easier to come by than ever. Most divorced folks are fleeing relationships that, in later years at least, were sadly lacking in physical activity.Read Post | Comments (51)Michelangelo Signorile, 08/20/12Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesIn my post last week, I stated that no one should be exploiting the tragic FRC shooting for political gain. That\u0027s why I and many others are greatly disappointed by the press conference you held last week, and I\u0027d like to take this opportunity to invite you to have a public discussion with me about hate.Read Post | Comments (22)Sheri Meyers, 08/20/12AUTHOR: “Chatting or Cheating: How to Detect Infidelity, Rebuild Love and Affair-Proof Your Relationship”If you\u0027re suspecting that your partner may be hiding something, if a sinking feeling in your gut is telling you \"something\u0027s off,\" then it\u0027s absolutely time to pay attention.Read Post | Comments (29)Jonathan Weiler, 08/20/12Director of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel HillMissouri Republican Senate candidate Todd Akin has been appropriately pilloried over the past 24 hours for his amazing \"legitimate rape\" comments. But should we any longer be surprised? Isn\u0027t this what the Republican Party has come to?Read Post | CommentsRebecca Solnit, 08/20/12Author, \u0027A Paradise Built in Hell\u0027Most women fight wars on two fronts, one for whatever the putative topic is and one simply for the right to speak, to have ideas, to be acknowledged to be in possession of facts and truths, to have value, to be a human being.Read Post | Comments (28)James Zogby, 08/18/12President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027The American story is not about a country that was born great, but about a country struggling to become better. It is one infused with humility, a recognition of our failings and our continuing efforts to correct injustice and make change.Read Post | Comments (326)Phil Angelides, 08/20/12Chairman, Financial Crisis Inquiry CommissionThese days, the business sections of newspapers read like rap sheets. Money laundering. Price fixing. Bid rigging. Securities fraud. Talking about the mob? No, unfortunately. Wall Street.Read Post | Comments (69)Jordan Bach, 08/20/12Writer, blogger, and speakerIn all the little ways in which we indulge in gossip, snarky talk, and making jokes about other people, we are beaming a clear intention into the ether, and we mustn\u0027t be shocked when that nastiness comes floating back to us.Read Post | CommentsDon McNay, 08/18/12Bestselling author, \u0027What to Do When You Win the Lottery\u0027 and \u0027Wealth Without Wall Street\u0027I wonder if young people understand how to deal with adversity. If young people have been sheltered from overcoming failure, they may not understand that adversity ultimately leads to opportunity.Read Post | Comments (280)Ellen Bravo, 08/20/12Director, Family Values @ WorkWe have no quarrel with executives getting paid sick days. But the workers who clean their office, deal with their customers, and guard their building should have them as well.Read Post | CommentsRichard (RJ) Eskow, 08/20/12Writer; host, \u0027The Breakdown\u0027; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureWhen the story of Duane Reade\u0027s Anthony Cuti is put together with the better-known story of Bain\u0027s relationship with a Medicare-defrauding lab testing company, it becomes a tale of two criminal CEOs -- and of the presidential candidate who was involved in choosing them both.Read Post | Comments (46)Diana Nyad, 08/18/12Long-distance swimmer, journalist, and broadcasterThis Xtreme Dream of mine, the Cuba Swim, has rendered me awake and alive and alert.

The turbulent aftermath has confirmed their worst fears.Read Post | CommentsDavid Paul, 08/19/12President, Fiscal Strategies GroupDavid Stockman was the Paul Ryan of the Reagan era, and the similarities are uncanny. The central question facing the Reagan Revolution was whether Reagan could cut taxes, increase defense spending and balance the budget, all at once.Read Post | Comments (229)Raymond J. Learsy, 08/20/12Author, \u0027Oil and Finance: The Epic Corruption Continues\u0027After nearly four years in office, that the United States is even more dependent on Middle East oil is shocking testimony to the failure of the Obama Administration\u0027s energy policies.Read Post | Comments (51)Carly Cylinder, 08/18/12Owner, Flour LAThere\u0027s no shortage of in-your-face wedding planning on TV right now, but I was curious: What goes on behind the scenes that we don\u0027t know about?
