{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Author, \u0027Dangerous Ground\u0027Veterans are useful for display purposes only, but are readily forgotten when the cost of their service become inconvenient for the non-serving public. It is high time the American public demanded a full debate over veterans issues by their political leaders, especially those who aspire to the highest office in the land. But they are not going to get it when the candidates involved spent a lifetime either avoiding military service, or wrapping themselves in the glory of their own military service. Not every American who wore a military uniform is a hero. But they served, and that alone qualifies them for better treatment at the hands of those they served than they are getting today.As a dyslexic kid, my biggest fear in life was to go in front of the class and read because I just wasn\u0027t very good at it -- and that stays with you through your whole life. I practiced, and practiced, and practiced, and practiced to make sure I\u0027d nail it.Public speaker, activist, OlympianMost Americans struggle to recognize or understand their country\u0027s permanent security state, in which elected politicians seem to run the show, but the CIA and the Pentagon often take the lead -- a state that inherently gravitates toward military, rather than diplomatic, solutions to foreign-policy challenges. Viewed through the lens of history, the main job of U.S. presidents is to be mature and wise enough to stand up to the permanent war machine.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia UniversityAmy Schumer\u0027s Trainwreck introduces us to a new kind of mainstream film heroine: blunt, thoughtless, more interested in being gratified than likable, one whose boundless appetites are played for fun rather than derision.WriterIt\u0027s too soon to know how badly Donald Trump damaged himself by belittling John McCain\u0027s war record in Iowa on July 18. Trump himself has until now been helped, not harmed, by insulting his GOP rivals as losers, clowns, dummies and lightweights.USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorIn his July 17 Facebook post, Franklin Graham, president of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and Samaritan\u0027s Purse, spewed unhinged hatred and bigotry against American Muslims. Writing his response to the Chattanooga shooting. Such language would, and does, radicalize ignorant youth. It fosters terrorism.Lawyer, Speaker, Best-Selling Author of \"EXTREMIST\"We do not live in a post-racial society. And we will never will until this country makes it a national priority to confront the racialized myths upon which this country was built. We must lead the way in facing the complex history of racism in America and the way in which it continues to be a deadly plague upon black bodies.Author of Stand Your Ground: Black Bodies \u0026 the Justice of God, Episcopal priest, Professor and Director Of Religion at Goucher College.Like many people following the negotiations between Greece and its creditors, I was inclined to see Wolfgang Schauble, Germany\u0027s finance minister, as the villain of the story. Schauble did not argue for throwing Greece out of the euro simply as a punitive measure, although he quite obviously disapproved of the way Greece had run its budget and its economy.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027For the Netroots Nation convention, the most notable thing was that two Democratic candidates for president showed up, and three did not. Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u0027Malley were both on hand to court Lefties, but I had to wonder where Hillary Clinton was.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comIf progressives don\u0027t articulate their frustrations and propose real solutions, right wing populists will propose crackpot ones. Token gestures won\u0027t fool anybody.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Disclosure of electoral spending has widespread support among the public, and it still has support among many Republican state lawmakers. ALEC, it seems, is trying to change that.The Center for Media and Democracy/ALEC ExposedTo all those candidates losing their minds and expressing outrage at Donald Trump now - where were you then? Donald Trump\u0027s comments are sickening. But, so is the putrid selective outrage being displayed by his competitors in the primary.Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranThe president and congress should not leave out youth behind bars in efforts to reform criminal justice this year and their actions must focus on reforms at both the federal and state level. Kalief Browder and Andre Sheffield\u0027s deaths are a sobering reminder to the president and the congress of the urgency and the need to ensure youth behind bars are not left behind.President \u0026 CEO of the Youth First! InitiativeA year after the ebola epidemic took hold, we know that stronger, integrated community-based delivery systems are necessary to help prevent such outbreaks and support progress against the top killers of women and children -- especially malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhea.Co-author, \u0027The Generosity Network\u0027Co-author, \u0027The Generosity Network\u0027Disconnecting forces your mind to process an event differently than if you\u0027re simply going to tweet it. It\u0027s hard to experience what\u0027s all around you when you\u0027re spending every moment with your eyes glued to a screen.Writing, Birding, Adventuring, LivingThis comedy is often so deliriously entertaining and so deftly constructed, you won\u0027t realize for a time that one of America\u0027s favorite, new, politically astute comics is having her values derailed.A lecturer at The City College of New York and has written for The Village Voice, indieWire, Soho Style, Flair, New York Daily News, and The Advocate.It appears there is nothing young, white men can do, including killing lots of innocent people at church, that will tarnish the positive bias toward that group, and there is nothing amazing enough that black men can do that will allow them to escape being perceived as the ones to be feared.Author, Speaker, ActivistMany of you are in the entrepreneurial struggle, and trust me, that\u0027s a struggle I know all too well. It can produce great outcomes but it is often brutally hard. There\u0027s a parallel struggle that has been known to produce equally great outcomes.MotherThrough the union, educators are raising our collective voice. Together with parents and students, educators are turning the tide. Teaching is our heart. Our students are our soul. And the union is our spine. When educators raise their voice and their power, we can reclaim the promise of public education.President, American Federation of TeachersTo know Bob Levinson is to know his strength, his determination and his drive -- to know his deep, unwavering love for my mother and for all my family. He will not go silently into the night. My father is as determined to get home as we are to get him home. But we need Iran\u0027s help.Wife, mother, financial services employee, and advocate for her father, Bob Levinson, the longest held hostage in U.S. history.Any foreign agreement, no matter how good it is, should not be allowed to countenance continued aggrandizement of executive power and further subversion the republic\u0027s Constitution.Senior Fellow and Director of the Center on Peace \u0026 Liberty, The Independent InstituteTrump is leading or doing well in several national and early state polls. That\u0027s why the other candidates and all Republican leaders should be denouncing his ignorance and xenophobia more forcefully.Attorney; USA Today Columnist, NBCNews.com ContributorHuman beings find it tough to give and receive feedback. Many of us — let’s be real, all of us — get defensive when we hear it, and we assume nobody wants to hear it from us. So feedback gets chronically buried and put off. But it doesn’t have to.Co-Founder, AsanaIt\u0027s a woman\u0027s prerogative to change her hair. But when body hair changes without our permission? Then it\u0027s our imperative to check it out. Because hair is a signifier -- its presence, its gain, or its loss -- hair is always trying to tell us something.Prevention provides service journalism at its best: news, perspective-shifting features and practical strategies to enhance lives.In the past, he has advocated government health care, an assault weapons ban, and 14.25 percent flat tax on all wealthy Americans.

Sports lover. Whiskey drinker. Mom.Trump\u0027s whole agenda is provocation, which isn\u0027t to say he doesn\u0027t believe what he\u0027s saying. But he\u0027s also so over the top, so almost unbelievably bold, that he\u0027s become something of a parody of himself. And it feels as if he\u0027s fully in on the joke, which he may be. We could use a little provocation.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarIn the weeks following the unspeakable gun violence in Charleston, there was one public voice notably absent, namely, the NRA. This time America\u0027s \"oldest civil rights organization\" kept their collectives mouths shut. Well, almost all of them did.Mike the Gun GuyUltimately, it does not matter whether Pluto is called a planet or not. People get together, exchange arguments, give new names to the things around them. But Pluto is whatever it is, and has not changed a bit since we demoted it into a dwarf planet.Associate professor of physics in the University at Buffalo College of Arts and Sciences.BRISTOL -- Populism appeals to the \"will of people\" but is actually profoundly undemocratic. Democracy is about the negotiation of competing interests and the balancing of different values. Populism, in contrast, is a kind of mob rule. Where there is complexity, it offers simple solutions. Instead of seeking common ground, it looks to exaggerate the differences between them and us.Founding editor, The Philosophers’ MagazineSince President Barack Obama announced in December 2014 that the United States plans to restore full diplomatic relations with Cuba, avid travelers have been preparing to visit the small Caribbean nation.
