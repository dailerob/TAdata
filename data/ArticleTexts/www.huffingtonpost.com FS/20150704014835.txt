Other organizations might sponsor parades and make speeches. ISIS spilled blood. A beheading in France, the murder of 38 tourists at a resort in Tunisia and a bomb blast at a mosque in Kuwait all reminded the world, if it had somehow forgotten, that ISIS isn\u0027t merely interested in securing sovereignty over a particular stretch of territory. It has much grander ambitions. At the moment, it doesn\u0027t have the means to take on the world or take over even a single country. But that could change.
