{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"APKent Harville/BP PhotoA lot of people are angry at John McCain. But I come here not to condemn McCain but to weep for him. Watching a true American hero hang a For Sale sign on his principles is a profoundly sad thing. I find it deeply ironic that, at a time when voters are desperately longing for a political leader with authenticity, a man who defined the authenticity brand has now decided that the only way he can become president is to sell his soul. But it\u0027s worse than a Faustian bargain. At least Faust got what he desired in exchange for his soul. McCain, in giving up the core of who he is -- as a man and as a leader -- may actually be destroying his chances of getting what he so desires. The saddest thing is not how McCain has betrayed us -- it\u0027s how he has betrayed himself.READ POST | comments (78)04.03.2006 Van JonesSharpe James\u0027 hurried exit all but guarantees that Booker will become Newark\u0027s next mayor.
