{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"From crooksandliars.comAPDuring a campaign-style town hall meeting on Wednesday, President Bush continued his PR offensive on Iraq, offering an upbeat assessment of the situation there. According to the president, \"Things are good.\" He also continued to make the case that Iraq is an essential part of the war on terror. Luckily, Rep. Jack Murtha is still on the case, traveling around the country, speaking out, cutting through the fog of the administration\u0027s rosy rhetoric, and making it clear -- again and again -- that, as he puts it, \"Iraq is not about terrorism; it\u0027s about civil war\". And our presence there is only fueling the fire.READ POST | comments (20)01.11.2006 Michael SmerconishIf The Smoking Gun has it right then James Frey is a dirtbag.

It is for this reason I wrote a novel. At least there you\u0027re allowed to make things up.

In so doing, they have ignored the fundamental teachings of Jesus. They have forgotten about justice.READ POST | comments (20)01.11.2006 Cenk UygurThis isn\u0027t your garden variety every day Supreme Court confirmation hearings.

The New York Times business model is selling readers a bundle of hard and soft news and advertising (people do like to browse the ads).
