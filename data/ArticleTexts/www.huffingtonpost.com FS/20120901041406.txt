{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Hart International, Ltd.Partisan politics, so wrapped up in creating an antagonism between capitalism and government, misses the point. If we are to maintain ourselves as a republic, certain foundational principles of a republic must be upheld regardless of our economic structures. They are: popular sovereignty (power to the people, not Wall Street or Washington); resistance to corruption (placing special interests ahead of the common good); a sense of the common good (all those things that we own and hold in common); and most of all civic duty, citizen responsibility, and citizen participation. Mr. Eastwood, being a dramatist, could have made quite a discussion with that chair concerning these qualities and whether we all, not just the president, live up to them. The convention arena would have been even more dumbfounded, doubtless to the point of silence.Read Post | Comments (131)Kevin Maurer, 08/31/12Co-author, \u0027No Easy Day\u0027The public deserves to hear Mark Owen\u0027s account of the Bin Laden raid for many reasons. Chief among them is that though Bin Laden is dead, others will plot to attack the United States. We will need more men like the SEALs who answered the call in Abbottabad last May.Read Post | Comments (168)Arianna Huffington, 08/31/12This week\u0027s double issue of Huffington arrives in the brief lull between the conventions. It\u0027s all about the November election, featuring Ryan Grim and Sam Stein on President Obama\u0027s \"engagement gap,\" Michael Calderone on how Obama biographies reflect our political polarization, and Alice Hines on what the candidates eat on the campaign trail.Read Post | Comments (65)Howard Fineman, 08/31/12Editorial Director, AOL Huffington Post Media GroupMitt Romney did some of what he needed to do, but not everything he needed to do, at the Republican convention that ended Thursday night.Read Post | Comments (587)Jared Bernstein, 08/31/12Senior Fellow, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesBen Bernanke gave a good talk today -- worth reading if you\u0027re up for slogging through such things -- wherein he stressed the benefits and costs of all the stuff the Fed can do to help boost the economy when their main tool -- the federal funds rate -- is stuck at zero.Read Post | Comments (11)Karin Kasdin, 08/31/12Author, \u0027Oh Boy, Oh Boy, Oh Boy: Confronting Motherhood, Womanhood and Selfhood in a Household of Boys\u0027I\u0027m sorry ladies, and I want you to know I\u0027m eating my just desserts. I\u0027ve left my phone or my sunglasses in restaurants and shops all over town. I vividly remember the lasagna I served at my sweet 16 party, but can\u0027t recall what I ate for dinner last night.Read Post | Comments (142)Mohamed A. El-Erian, 08/31/12CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOGreek officials should certainly hope that collective European action will succeed in stabilizing these other two countries\u0027 economies. But they should also realize that too great a success could, ironically, map into a higher probability of a Grexit.Read Post | CommentsRobert L. Borosage, 08/31/12President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureFor all the talk about \"introducing\" Romney to America, Romney has to remain an enigma. He can\u0027t talk honestly about the economic calamity that Obama inherited because he champions the very policies that led to it. He must make us forget it.Read Post | Comments (337)Jay Sterling Silver, 08/31/12Law professor, St. Thomas University School of LawTodd Akin\u0027s vile remarks about \"legitimate rape\" and women\u0027s natural resistance to pregnancy from forcible intercourse disturbingly parallel the views of many in law enforcement and recall the sorry history of the crime of rape in American jurisprudence.Read Post | CommentsPeter Mandel, 08/31/12Washington Post and Boston Globe contributorThe Internet is a nearly infinite universe of things I do not want to know. I can usually ignore the boasts, the shards of opinion, the superfluous stuff that swirls around on my laptop. But there\u0027s one online fact that simply sticks in my craw: There are people out there who have been brazenly using my name.Read Post | CommentsRobert Reich, 08/31/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Republicans claim the rich are job creators. Nothing could be further from the truth. To create jobs, businesses need customers. But the rich spend only a small fraction of what they earn. The real job creators are the vast middle class, whose spending drives the economy and creates jobs.Read Post | Comments (821)Bill Moyers and Michael Winship, 08/31/12Ralph Reed\u0027s was a monstrous lie by one of the monumental hypocrites of our time.

But here is the bottom line: when multiple speakers have to testify how authentic you are -- you\u0027re not.Read Post | Comments (248)Chris Rodda, 08/31/12Senior Research Director, Military Religious Freedom Foundation; Author, \u0027Liars For Jesus\u0027Thanks to the Republicans\u0027 favorite pseudo-historian David Barton, \"American exceptionalism,\" a nineteenth century insult about the undeserved prideful nature of Americans is being proudly touted by Republicans everywhere. The irony is killing me.Read Post | Comments (87)Marian Wright Edelman, 08/31/12President, Children\u0027s Defense FundWe are once again at a critical turning point for our children and nation. Despite all the harsh lessons of the past and all the lofty rhetoric about who we want and need to be as a 21st century multicultural nation in a multiracial and multicultural world, we’re heading in the wrong direction.Read Post | CommentsAri Ratner, 08/31/12Former Obama Appointee at State DepartmentDespite his absence in Tampa, George W. Bush is omnipresent in W. Mitt Romney\u0027s campaign for president. He\u0027s just too big of an elephant to hide.Read Post | Comments (16)Dori Hartley, 08/31/12Author, \u0027Angels and Echoes\u0027I\u0027m so glad that I was part of the spark that ignited this eternal flame. I\u0027m so glad I was there when it all began. It will forever prove to me that we can indeed rise like Phoenixes from the ashes of our own devastating personal events.Read Post | Comments (12)Rep. Brad Miller, 08/31/12U.S. Representative for North Carolina\u0027s 13th Congressional DistrictI have a pretty good idea what legislation in the last decade could have \"corrected\" the housing crisis, and what legislation made it worse. Ryan voted wrong every time.Read Post | CommentsRep. Dennis Kucinich, 08/31/12U.S. Representative from Ohio\u0027s 10th DistrictThere can be no better way to honor the American worker then to support an increase in the minimum wage to a living wage of at least $10 per hour. That would be one Happy Labor Day.Read Post | Comments (53)John R. Talbott, 08/30/12Author, \"Survival Investing: How to Prosper Amid Thieving Banks and Corrupt Governments\"In speaking with my financial advisory clients, I find the most misunderstood concept is the difference between nominal returns and real returns. And Wall Street brokers and bankers are very quick to take advantage of this situation.Read Post | Comments (48)Nathaniel Frank, 08/31/12Author, \u0027Unfriendly Fire: How the Gay Ban Undermines the Military and Weakens America\u0027On Medicare, Ryan thundered, \"We need this debate.\" But on the social values that Republicans claim stand at the core of their being, they want no debate, just underhanded cues to appease the social conservatives in their fragile coalition.Read Post | Comments (123)Gov. Rick Snyder, 08/31/12Governor of MichiganThere are a lot of great stories of success in Michigan, and each of them has the same theme: Michigan is open for business, and together we\u0027re reinventing our state with relentless positive action.Read Post | Comments (38)Terry O\u0027Neill, 08/31/12President, National Organization for WomenConverting Medicare to a privatized voucher system is a key element of the Romney-Ryan scheme: take health care coverage for retirees out of the hands of the U.S. government, where it has worked comparatively well, and shift it to the private market, which has proven to be a high-cost failure.Read Post | Comments (65)Jamin Raskin, 08/31/12American University Law Prof, MD State Senator, People For the American Way Senior FellowWith Robert Bork at the helm, we will see more impunity and more unaccountability in corporate structures that are \"too big to fail\" and \"too big to jail.\"Read Post | CommentsMichael Roth, 08/31/12President, Wesleyan UniversityRick Levin hit the sweet spot of academic leadership more than most over the past 20 years.
