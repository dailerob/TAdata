{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jason LinkinsEditor, Eat the PressOne of the more hotly anticipated events of the annual CPAC conference is, of course, the Straw Poll. First conducted in 1976, the CPAC Straw Poll is a helpful measure of the pulse of the conservative movement, as attendees are encouraged to respond to questions covering a range of issues, such as their preferred policy priorities, their personal beliefs and how they feel about the job the president and Congress are doing. But the thing that basically everyone cares about is who the attendees want to be president. The 2013 CPAC opens at a time when the GOP is still fully in a sort of \"Crisis Interregnum,\" where scars from the 2012 presidential loss are still visible and internecine pressures -- between the activist base and the moneyed establishment, as well as between the future and the past -- are boiling under the surface. The Straw Poll ballot reflects all of these tensions.Comments (171)Stacey KramerFounder, BrandPlayI lost a friend and colleague last spring. His diagnosis was way worse than mine.
