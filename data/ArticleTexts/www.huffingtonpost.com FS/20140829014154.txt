{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Executive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostLong term, ISIS and the lure of other violent extremism in Islam and other religions will only be stopped if we are all invested in reaching out to young people. We have to be available to listen to their concerns, empathize with their sense of alienation, and help them find constructive ways to engage societal injustice. It is all of our responsibility to empower this generation with the knowledge and support they need to find a meaningful life and a positive identity that they can embrace and be proud of. ISIS and other radical groups are deadly serious about reaching out to young people with their skewed version of meaning that leads to death and destruction. Are we just as serious in reaching out to offer meaning that results in affirming life and creating a better world?Instead of joining with Democrats to expand opportunity for all Americans by fighting for equal pay and a raise for millions of Americans, investing in infrastructure and education, and creating jobs, Republicans like Rubio have recommitted to digging in their heels and causing rampant dysfunction that hurts middle class families.Author, \u0027For the Next Generation\u0027; Chair, Democratic National CommitteeThe new ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has immediately raised the same old question: Will it last, or is it merely just another pause, providing the prelude for the next round of fighting à la previous ceasefires? I believe the current ceasefire is different as it was achieved under completely different circumstances and may well last.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUWherever I go around the world, I see the same hunger to live our lives with more meaning and purpose and less unnecessary stress and burnout.I fit the description. I was a black man.Pastor, writer, activistOur conversation about mental illness needs to be a positive, healthy dialogue, not one laden with shame. As soon as that begins to happen, we\u0027ll be able to address these health issues more effectively.Associate Editor, GPS for the Soul, The Huffington PostI usually take great pride in calling myself an alumna of The George Washington University -- but not today. Dr. Stephen Joel Trachtenberg, current president emeritus and a professor of public service at GWU, made comments on the Diane Rehm Show this week about how college women drinking too much is feeding the campus rape crisis, and in doing so perpetuated the dangerous notion that it is a woman\u0027s fault for being sexually assaulted or raped. Change is needed on campus, but it does not need to come from the victim.Middle East correspondent, The WorldPostThose who are sincerely happy with their romantic choices spend more energy working on their own self-development than on appearing a certain way to attract love. Instead of concentrating on playing the game to entice a partner, put your focus on these five principles.Washington, DC Psychologist, Writer, Gender and Relatonship Expert @DrJillWeber; www.drjillweber.comThere\u0027s nothing wrong with a group of people standing against torture and abuse -- there\u0027s nothing wrong with lobbying for humane alternatives -- there\u0027s nothing wrong with strongly, perhaps loudly advocating on behalf of the defenseless animals who exist at the receiving end of our collective selfishness and gluttony.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027We can\u0027t help but be a little grateful that his fame is shining a spotlight on the very real but little discussed aspects of Parkinson\u0027s. Yet it brings into focus that the disease is more than just what we publicly acknowledge: tremors, rigidity, trouble walking and a host of other motor skills problems.Father, husband, attorney, Parkinson\u0027s advocate, marathoner, triathlete, optimistDoing well on tests is not an education, but simply a skill in taking tests. School offers an education that is too precious to be surrendered to those with no understanding of learning\u0027s ultimate meaning and value.Retired high-school teacherSaudi Arabia\u0027s internal discord and tensions over ISIS can only be understood by grasping the inherent (and persisting) duality that lies at the core of the Kingdom\u0027s doctrinal makeup and its historical origins.Fmr. MI-6 agent; Author, \u0027Resistance: The Essence of Islamic Revolution\u0027The power of your elected office, combined with a strong dose of moral courage on your part, can ?be harnessed to trigger a national dialogue. And once people start talking and reflecting, the layers of bigotry will gradually fall away.Social EntrepreneurThese critiques of athletes are not new. They have been articulated for years, in barbershops, bars, social media, various articles and blogs, by the everyday fan to the most celebrated scholars. But many still are misguided and inaccurate.Author, poet, philanthropist, 11-year NBA veteranThe National Rifle Association is in a quandary. The organization\u0027s leadership, which is sullied by a long history of sexism and misogyny, must continue to grow its market for guns in order to protect gun manufacturers\u0027 profits.Founder, Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in AmericaAt what point do mistakes aggregate into something evil? At the very least, do they prevent us from claiming the mantle of good? And, of course, it\u0027s not just the mistakes that are problematic but also the deliberate policies that, for instance, align Washington with dictators and other murderous actors.Director, Foreign Policy In FocusEvery time, in the heat of arguing, it\u0027s in our human nature to do our best to win. But if we\u0027re not focused on solving the problem, we\u0027re wasting time and energy that can be diverted into something more positive.Associate Creative Director, EF Education FirstWhen I started writing about the gender disparity I saw in Silicon Valley, I took intense fire from the boys club. They could get away with this because such frat-boy behavior was considered acceptable in Silicon Valley. But things are changing for the better.Academic, Researcher, Writer, EntrepreneurBuffett used his punch-card analogy in an investment context. It\u0027s consistent with his belief that really profitable investment decisions are few and far between. But I think the punch-card analogy applies equally well to life, and to the decisions that define and shape our lives.CEO, RBC Wealth Management - U.S.It\u0027s important to recognize that the qualities men and women share, or don\u0027t, are fluid and ever-changing, and prone to shifting with time, experience, and relationships.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarLet\u0027s hypothesize a theater of solitude: a single character grappling with his own interminable discourse -- at intervals whispered and shouted; prosaic one moment, poetic or even epic the next. What is the status, in that case, of this voice that speaks nonstop?Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.Fortunately, many of the damaging effects of sleep apnea can be stopped, and even reversed, through diagnosis and treatment.President of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and Board-Certified Sleep PhysicianHighly enlightening new data from the New York City-based Citizens Budget Commission demonstrate the immense importance of walkability and transit in shaping how affordable large US cities are for a range of household types.Special Counsel for Urban Solutions, Natural Resources Defense CouncilThe profound division of American society along racial lines is part of a vicious circle exacerbating a host of social problems, from excessive use of force by the police to mass incarceration and wealth inequality.AuthorWe spend time every day in the company of others, but without explicit communication. Our lives unfold socially but silently, but even in the silence, good experiences get better and bad experiences get worse.Author, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027While well intentioned, products like \"Undercover Colors\" actually perpetuate rape culture by placing the burden of safety back onto women.State Policy \u0026 Partnerships Coordinator, Advocates for YouthFormer Mayor Bloomberg presided over an impressive and significant investment in public space, leveraging the frenzied pace of real estate development to subsidize new parks. Yet, somehow, the new open spaces built in the past decade - free and accessible to all - have come to symbolize, for some, just the opposite: elitism and the inequality of opportunity.Editor, The Architectural League\u0027s Urban OmnibusI wasn\u0027t supposed to walk away from the NFL, but I did. I wasn\u0027t supposed to be writing television, but I am. I\u0027m supposed to be lost after football. I\u0027m not. I\u0027ve reinvented myself. This is my first transformation.6-year NFL veteran, screenwriter, creatorBut if you think you\u0027re protected from losing cash by using a debit card, perhaps you need to rethink your definition of protection. Debit cards get scammed the same as credit cards, but that\u0027s where the similarity ends.Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911I don\u0027t blame the young man for taking the visual cue of my body and neatly categorizing me with the 5k\u0027ers (which is also a very respectable distance, by the way). Why would he believe that my plus-size body is capable of 21 long kilometres when there aren\u0027t any visual cues presented in society to tell us this is possible?Founder, Body ExchangeEven though you have been a part of my life, you are not my life. I am a smart, strong, independent person and I have the power to control where my life takes me. Maybe I can\u0027t do that completely on my own -- I might need the help of a prescription, or the advice of a therapist, or a good cry session every now and then. But I\u0027m stronger than you.Student, writer, football addict, daughter, friendGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"OBAMA: RUSSIA \u0027RESPONSIBLE\u0027",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
