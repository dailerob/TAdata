{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"I\u0027ve always thought that, as a country, we do a lousy job of addressing how we can do divorce differently -- and better. Especially when there are children involved. That\u0027s why I\u0027m so excited about the launch of HuffPost Divorce. Inspired by HuffPost editor-at-large Nora Ephron, who knows a thing or two about the subject (see Heartburn), our newest section will tackle the topic from many angles, providing insight, resources, community, and some comic relief to those impacted by what Nora, in her new book, calls the Big D. Our goal is to produce a fast, fearless, highly interactive guide to the profound changes divorce brings. So whether you are divorced, divorcing, or just curious about how others manage the complexities of divorce, check out HuffPost Divorce. Breaking up is hard to do... but reading about it isn\u0027t. Let us know what you think.Read Post | CommentsNora Ephron, 11.08.2010Author; Editor At Large, Huffington PostThe most important thing about me, for quite a long chunk of my life, was that I was divorced.

It appears to me that Obama is engaged in \"strategic ambiguity.\"Read Post | CommentsTrey Ellis, 11.08.2010Novelist, Screenwriter, and Assistant Professor at Columbia UniversityWhat the White House still seems to have forgotten, even after the recent \"shellacking,\" is that we elected a commander-in-chief, not mediator-in-chief. A mediator rarely offers his own opinions but steers both sides toward civility.Read Post | CommentsSen. Bernie Sanders, 11.08.2010Independent U.S. Senator from VermontIf there is a silver lining in the action of MSNBC against Keith Olbermann, it is that people will now pay more attention to the political role of corporate media in America.Read Post | CommentsStephen Schlesinger, 11.08.2010Author and Fellow at the Century FoundationAmerican advocacy for India\u0027s inclusion on the UN Security Council really is only symbolic.

But marrying a British prince isn\u0027t a dream -- it\u0027s a nightmare!Read Post | CommentsLinda Bergthold, 11.07.2010Health policy consultantDespite promises from Republicans to repeal the health care reform law, they can\u0027t do it. Even if the Senate agreed with the House and passed a repeal bill, President Obama would veto it. But what about death by a thousand cuts?Read Post | CommentsGlenn D. Braunstein, M.D., 11.08.2010Chairman of the Department of Medicine at Cedars-Sinai Medical CenterThe flu is not just a bad cold. If the fever, chills, cough, sore throat, congestion, muscle and body aches, headaches and fatigue weren\u0027t misery-making enough on their own, the illness can spark some nasty complications.Read Post | CommentsRabbi Mordecai Finley, 11.08.2010Spiritual leader, Ohr HaTorah SynagogueAnger is the great toxin; it will make any relationship bad and any divorce worse.
