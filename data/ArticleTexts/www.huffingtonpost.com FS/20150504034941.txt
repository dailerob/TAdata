{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027I am going to periodically suggest ideas that Hillary Clinton might consider -- both to establish that she is a real-deal progressive and to rally political support from voters whom the economy is leaving behind. Clinton might even outflank some leading progressives by going beyond what is considered politically safe in the current environment. Another name for that is leadership. So if Hillary wants to show that she\u0027s a fighter, let her pick some good fights. Trade promotion authority that the White House needs for both the TPP and the TTIP is now hanging by a thread. A well-placed boot by Hillary Clinton would be the coup de grace. It would show gumption, leadership and political nerve -- and gain her immense credit from critics of these bogus deals all across the political spectrum. It\u0027s time. Some Wall Street supporters might get off her bandwagon -- and good riddance. She has plenty to spare.At a time when the supply of information seems unlimited and overwhelming, journalists and journalism are being challenged like never before. It seems contradictory, but it makes a perverse kind of sense. Despots and autocrats and terrorists are threatened by the free flow of information.Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public AffairsSo when I read about Freddie Gray, it brought the fight for change into focus. Yes, I can blog and tweet and march and hashtag -- and I will -- but as a political organizer by heart and habit, I believe my calling is to insist that the candidates I support take action to create jobs and justice.Chair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusIf the Trans-Pacific Partnership is enacted, big corporations, Wall Street, and their top executives and shareholders will make out like bandits. Who will the bandits be stealing from? The rest of us.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The curfew has been lifted in Baltimore. But the poverty remains, and so does the death and injury it brings. Structural violence is the deepest and deadliest form of violence in our country, and it is a byproduct of inequality. Until it is addressed, simmering tensions may continue to erupt into open conflicts like Baltimore\u0027s -- or worse.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourAs we bid a sad but fond farewell to this transformative and ground-breaking television series, I want to share with all my viewers and readers this classic Between the Lines episode.Host and Producer of Between the Lines with Barry Kibrick seen on PBS.Our annual Khalil Gibran \"Spirit of Humanity\" Awards Dinner serves as a reminder of why we do the work we do. It speaks to us of the goals we\u0027ve set for ourselves, the progress we\u0027ve made, and the challenges we continue to face.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Rubio\u0027s meme is \"I\u0027m the future\", but models JFK and Obama didn\u0027t want to go back to \u002720s and \u002750s. Clinton\u0027s is \"I\u0027m your neighbor\u0027s mom\", but will GOP Evita-ize her? Lowry and Vanden Heuvel discuss both as well as whether the bi-partisan agreement on Congress\u0027s role on Iran Deal is win-win for both parties.Host, \u0027Both Sides Now\u0027KIPP Schools, Success Academies, Democracy Prep and any number of other \"no excuses\" schools are not developing true grit and resilience other than the numb grit required to endure humiliation and the resilience necessary to get up and go to school every day.Head of the Calhoun School in ManhattanThe comments came after Walker, an unannounced candidate for president, used an appearance on an Iowa radio show to publicly attack a bipartisan criminal investigation into his campaign as a \"political witch hunt\" with the aim of \"trying to intimidate people.\"The Center for Media and Democracy/ALEC ExposedStrong gun laws are not equivalent to taking guns away from citizens. To the contrary, they consist of transparent rules and procedures designed to manage the possession, storage and carrying of firearms in order to limit access to legitimate users alone.Research Director, Igarapé InstituteWe should not have to take to the streets every time a Black person is killed by police. Demanding accountability for individual injustices is very important. But we also need to use our voices and our power to change the systemic, structural inequality that will continue to result in police violence and abuse against Black people.Executive Director, ColorOfChangeIn fact, we have no clear, complete, scientifically supported picture of what a college ready student looks like, nor any proven way to measure the complex of qualities (that we still can\u0027t name and quantify). Standardized test scores are not a proxy, not even a bad oneTeacher and writer; blogger, curmudgucation.blogspot.comDaniel DiSalvo\u0027s new book paints a dark conspiracy where public sector unions push for ever higher pay and benefits, work rules that allow for endless loafing on the job, and disciplinary policies that prevent even the most incompetent from being fired. It\u0027s a moving story -- the data just don\u0027t quite fit the picture.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Hillary Clinton, please take a moment to thank Rep. Steve King for his tremendously effective effort to assure your election in 2016. When it comes to rapidly ascendant American Latino and Asian-American voters, Steve King and his radical ideas are the equivalent of several, well-funded SuperPacs dumping money in Hillary Clinton\u0027s favor.Univision America Host \u0026 contributor to NPR, The Hill, FoxNews Latino and other mediaSocial media has changed the way we engage with news. After the events of April 27 in Baltimore, however, it appears that the future may already be upon us. Enter the latest tool in journalists\u0027 arsenal: Periscope.Researcher in news, journalism, and #hashtagsIf we are going to discuss the effectiveness of federal policies in our cities -- and we should -- it is time to discuss as well why some states continue to benefit systemically to the disadvantage of others, with little or no benefit to show for it in terms of relative progress as measured by socio-economic indicators.President, Fiscal Strategies GroupWhether you\u0027re still in the midst of the storm or idling in the aftermath, the truth is that you have to reach down and make the decision that although you may have had no control over what happened to you, you do have control over how you respond and move forward.

Mary is the creator of the Boom Bounce Wow Resilience Method.Maryland State Attorney Marilyn Mosby acted swiftly and courageously in indicting the cops who killed Freddie Gray. But as time has shown, it\u0027s one thing to indict and another to convict cops. Let\u0027s hope this go-round it will be different.Author and political analystOver and over again, anti-gay groups have trotted out clergy and chaplains as beleaguered minorities whose rights are being trampled. And over and over again, this line of reasoning intentionally misconstrues the relationship among religion, law and marriage.Historian of American politics, law, and religionDrugs Over Dinner aims to provide a safety net for those secretly crumbling under their own addiction or that of a loved one. We have the opportunity and the tools to change the status quo and fight addiction together.Founder and CEO, Newport AcademyFounder and CEO, Newport AcademyIn the past few days, the world was bombarded with images of enraged Baltimore youth.

Maybe things aren\u0027t as good as they used to be. Perhaps one of you has been unhappy recently and you can\u0027t figure out why. Here are 10 signs that your relationship is over.Matchmaker, dating expert, relationship advisorWe all know what it\u0027s like to be so frustrated that we are tempted to damage something or someone we hold dear. That could be punching a wall, throwing a dish or cell phone, or sadly enough, assaulting a loved one. None of these responses are justified or right. Hence, we need a remedy.Lead Pastor of a mulitcultural megachurch, author on race relations,radio \u0026 television talk show host, and cultural diversity consultant.Computing has become an inextricable part of our lives. While I can\u0027t argue that computer science is more important than calculus or statistics or a physical or natural science course, it\u0027s becoming extremely difficult to argue that it shouldn\u0027t be an equal player in that array of extraordinary human achievement.Professor of Computer Science at Harvey Mudd CollegeMaybe that\u0027s what being middle-aged is all about... reaching the tipping point of self-actualization where you are like, \"Oh, screw it.
