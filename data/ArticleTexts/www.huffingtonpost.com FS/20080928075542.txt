{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOLast night\u0027s debate was a political Rorschach test. Wherever you were at 8:59 pm ET, you were at 10:36 pm. It was a good night for Obama because, when 83 percent of the country believe we are on the wrong track, standing toe-to-toe with McCain on foreign policy is all you need to do. And Obama clearly did that. It was a good night for McCain because, after a week in which he\u0027d been bleeding like a hemophiliac in a barbed wire factory, tonight stanched the bleeding. But it was a bad night for reality. Did both candidates really try to make the case that we are safer today than we were after 9/11?Read Post | CommentsBIONora Ephron, 09.27.2008There was a moment, when the debate ended and the wives came up on stage, where I actually knew, or thought I knew, who had won. I\u0027m sorry to say it, but it was John McCain.Read Post | Comments (505)BIOJohn Farr, 09.27.2008I was lucky enough to meet both Paul and Joanne Woodward several years back at the opening of their new theatre at the Westport Playhouse, where I moderated an evening with them and their daughter Nell.Read Post | CommentsMadeleine Albright, 09.26.2008Tonight was a breakthrough for Obama, who showed himself truly ready to be president. He responded knowledgeably, thoughtfully and confidently to the toughest questions on the economy, Iraq, and terror.Read Post | Comments (469)BIOAdam McKay, 09.27.2008Obama is awfully hard to make look naive. He\u0027s one icy mofo and he\u0027s sharp as hell. He can out-world-leader-reference McCain any day of the week and would thrash him in a game of \"measured but strong\" (who remembers that game?).Read Post | Comments (101)BIOWill.i.am, 09.27.2008I\u0027m glad that Senator Obama brought domestic issues to a foreign policy debate, because fixing \"home\" would alter our foreign relations.Read Post | Comments (53)BIOBryan Young, 09.27.2008It is with a heavy heart that I recommend a few movies for you to watch this weekend in honor of one of the most charitable actors the world has known.Read Post | Comments (41)BIOSherman Yellen, 09.27.2008I worried that the American public had been so seduced over the past eight years by self-serving stories -- rather than practical realities -- that the storyteller would always win the day.Read Post | Comments (16)BIOPaul Reiser, 09.27.2008I have to say, I did want to see more fire from Obama. I did want him to let the anger loose. I did want him to slap back at McCain\u0027s endless patronizing tone.Read Post | Comments (233)BIOGreg Mitchell, 09.27.2008My feeling is that the Couric interview might have done for McCain what the first Nixon-Kennedy debate did for Nixon in 1960 -- a true watershed moment.Read Post | Comments (45)BIORobert Shrum, 09.26.2008Tonight I think we know who the next President will be. McCain kept repeating that Obama doesn\u0027t \"understand.\" But he clearly did. McCain made up no ground.Read Post | Comments (520)BIOSean Penn, 09.26.2008The result tonight was another frustrating piece of American media that is at once far too polite, and at the same time, dismissive of an American public\u0027s need to know anything beyond jingoistic self-aggrandizement.Read Post | Comments (254)Sheryl Crow, 09.26.2008I think I feel the same as most Americans when I say I am beyond tired of hearing John McCain sell this war and passing it off as great leadership. To me, McCain proved himself as the stubborn one.Read Post | Comments (117)Michael Seitzman, 09.27.2008Bob Barr, 09.27.2008Erica Jong, 09.26.2008Chris Durang, 09.26.2008Roseanne Barr, 09.26.2008Jacob Heilbrunn, 09.26.2008Max Bergmann, 09.26.2008Bob Cesca, 09.26.2008Andy Borowitz, 09.26.2008Marian Wright Edelman, 09.26.2008Matt Miller, 09.27.2008Judd Legum, 09.26.2008Linda Bergthold, 09.26.2008George Lakoff, 09.26.2008Bill Press, 09.27.2008Tom Gregory, 09.27.2008Sheila Tendy, 09.27.2008Nancy L.
