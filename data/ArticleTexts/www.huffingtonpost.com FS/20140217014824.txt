{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week was about storms and climate change. First, Missouri football star Michael Sam ignited a storm and changed the climate in the NFL by coming out, making him, when he\u0027s drafted, the league\u0027s first openly gay player. A blizzard of mostly positive -- and a few regrettably negative -- reactions ensued. Climate change was less constructive in Sochi, where thermometers hit the 50s, giving the place a warmer Wednesday than many host cities of Summer Olympics. Along America\u0027s East Coast, however, yet another winter storm descended, which in turn ignited a chilly exchange between New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and Al Roker over school closures. Taking on special interests is one thing, but picking a fight with a beloved weatherman is another. Meanwhile, I was lucky enough to be in balmy San Francisco for the Wisdom 2.0 conference, devoted to spreading mindfulness in a stormy world. Not a moment too soon.CommentsEllen PageActressI\u0027m here today because I am gay. And because... maybe I can make a difference. To help others have an easier and more hopeful time. Regardless, for me, I feel a personal obligation and a social responsibility. I also do it selfishly, because I am tired of hiding and I am tired of lying by omission.Comments (35)Elizabeth DrewJournalistIt\u0027s possible that criminal charges will be brought against Christie or his aides. But much larger questions are before officials of New Jersey and the federal prosecutors investigating the various charges against Christie and his subordinates and allies.Comments (20)Brian ShactmanAnchor and reporter for MSNBCCold War or no Cold War, when Russia plays the United States in hockey, it\u0027s an event. When it\u0027s in the Olympics, it means more. When those Olympics are in Russia and the nation\u0027s president basically pins a nation\u0027s hopes on its hockey team, well, then it\u0027s intense.CommentsMark DannerAuthor, \u0027Torture and the Forever War\u0027For all his experience and sophistication, that grimly blank expression -- calmly unflinching gaze, slightly lopsided frown -- embodied a philosophy of power unapologetically, brutally simple: attack, crush enemies; cause others to fear, submit. Power from time to time must be embodied in vivid violence, like Voltaire\u0027s executions, pour encourager les autres.Comments (131)Arianna HuffingtonEvery day there really are more and more conversations happening about the benefits of mindfulness and sleep and stress reduction. And not just in outlets that write about these topics on a regular basis, but in every part of the media landscape.Comments (22)Jeffrey SachsDirector, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \"To Move the World: JFK\u0027s Quest for Peace\"This violence could be brought to a quick end with a more enlightened policy by the United States and its allies. Yet the U.S. government contributes to the trajectory of escalating violence by demanding that another head of state must leave or else.Comments (27)Bill StiegerWriter from St. Paul, MNWe damn well know the pointlessness of self-pity. But through these recent ordeals we have grown jaundiced about our government and both political parties. Our Congress, with little exception, is solely representative of corporate interests, not people like us.Comments (131)Brian BoitanoOlympic figure skating championThe International Olympic Committee will never again select a host country that is not tolerant and that does not support human rights, and that in itself is a next step.Comments (34)Paul Brandeis RaushenbushExecutive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostThere is a deplorable and tragic common thread that ties together recent, global acts of oppression against LGBT people: Christian complicity.Comments (172)Claire FallonManaging Blog Editor, The Huffington PostWell, here we are. A drippy, chilly, dark February Friday just like any other -- except that we have to watch our coworkers sniff at ponderous towers of roses and baby\u0027s breath that were delivered to their desks throughout the day.Comments (56)Joseph A. PalermoProfessor, historian, authorIt\u0027s amazing how these people can whine in public about how they\u0027re being mistreated by people who change the sheets at the luxury hotels they stay in. But if you spend your life surrounded with sycophants who constantly tell you how brilliant you are it\u0027s possible to exist inside a bubble inside a bubble inside a bubble.Comments (156)Ann BrenoffSenior Writer, The Huffington PostWe are just seven weeks into 2014 and already I am annoyed, verklempt if you will. Here\u0027s a list of the top 7 things pushing me -- and others -- over the top.Comments (62)Jordan K. TurgeonSenior Lifestyle Blog Editor, The Huffington PostWould I be checking because I genuinely wanted to see all those pictures and status updates? Or would I be checking out of some strange obligation now that it was \"allowed\" again? I hadn\u0027t missed social media during my time away, so why go back?CommentsRev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkWhat Michael Sam did took tremendous strength and valor. Not only did he proclaim his truth to the world, but he did so knowing that he could very well lose a lot in the process.Comments (18)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarMicromanaging can show up in many forms, but most typically in bosses who dictate how employees complete tasks, question employees\u0027 judgments, frequently ask for updates and check-in incessantly.CommentsJordan PriceDesigner, artist, and father living in San FranciscoAll I know is that I wanted to work at Apple really bad -- and now not so much. Today at lunch time I wiped the iPad data clean, put the files I had been working on neatly on the server, left all their belongings on my desk, and I got in my car and drove home.Comments (871)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundHunger and malnutrition have devastating consequences for children. Federal nutrition programs continue to be a critical support to ensure children\u0027s daily nutritional needs are met: they put food on children\u0027s plates, help build healthy minds and bodies, and help lift families out of poverty.Comments (117)Noah MichelsonExecutive Editor, HuffPost Gay VoicesI don\u0027t want you to walk away from this letter thinking that I\u0027m not targeting your children. I most certainly am. Here are just a few things I want your kids to know.Comments (219)David MargolickContributing editor, Vanity FairPreserved only on grainy kinescopes (though not by NBC, which had chucked them), Sid Caesar\u0027s creations were never recycled. So millions of viewers today don\u0027t know of his legacy. Or think they don\u0027t. In fact, they see it every night.CommentsJim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027While many may be struggling through aisles of candy hearts and bunches of roses, I invite you to flip this day of mandatory public expressions of love on its head. What if, along with romantic dinners and expensive chocolates, we celebrated those we love by committing ourselves against sexual and domestic violence?Comments (17)TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"Hamburger grease. Frozen wine. Live worms. These are just some of the materials artist Phil Hansen uses to create his stunning artwork. Find out how limits fuel his creativity and see his unbelievable creations for yourself.Comments (19)Kristen Welchwearethatfamily.comI can confirm the temperature because I have known the extremes: a cold marriage, filled with contempt and misery. A lukewarm marriage, perhaps the worst, filled with idle days, stagnant affection and distant intimacy. We have lived every season.Comments (87)Sec. Arne DuncanU.S. Secretary of EducationWhen I take the court tonight for the NBA Celebrity All-Star Game, the number I\u0027ll wear -- 80 -- is rarely seen on a basketball jersey, but represents a record in education. That number -- 80 percent -- is the newly announced high school graduation rate, the highest in American history.Comments (20)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Since we have a Congress that is unwilling to take the steps to increase demand in the labor market, the best way we may have of increasing job openings is by reducing supply.Comments (257)John FefferCo-director, Foreign Policy In FocusIf we look a little closer at the agenda of the extreme right, we get warmer. Parties as diverse as Jobbik in Hungary, the National Front in France, and Golden Dawn in Greece have identified a common enemy -- the Other, the non-European, the foreigner.Comments (21)Nicholas MirielloSenior/International Blog Editor, The Huffington PostThe poet John Hennessy shares a name with a millionaire college president, who was not long ago profiled in the New Yorker, and a cognac everyone knows, but not everyone drinks. His name positions his work in a cruel sort of fame and obscurity.CommentsShadi BartschHelen A Regenstein Distinguished Service Professor of Classics, University of ChicagoAmerican citizens concerned about our military policy abroad might find an interesting mirror in ancient Rome. The Romans were pretty sure they were the good guysComments (165)Bernard-Henri LévyFrench philosopher and writerCopenhagen. Royal Library of Denmark. The paradox of a monarchy, a real one, scrupulously attached to its etiquette and protocol, as I had the chance to observe at a gala last night at the French embassy, but one that is also, and without any contradiction, one of the most egalitarian societies that I can name.CommentsJanice BensonLives and works in New Madrid, MOSome days I am so weary I could sit and cry, if I didn\u0027t have so much to do. Entire networks and politicians make careers out of demonizing women like me as takers. Meanwhile, I just pray and work.Comments (399)Frank AckermanSenior economist at Synapse Energy Economics and a lecturer at MITThe apparent progress on emission reductions in rich countries has occurred at a time of widespread outsourcing of manufacturing to China and other developing countries. In the process, we have effectively outsourced our carbon emissions as well. If consumers are responsible for the emissions from making the consumer goods they buy, then we have not solved the problem.CommentsDr. Reese Halter, 2014.16.02Regina Weinreich, 2014.16.02Steven Strauss, 2014.16.02Fern Siegel, 2014.16.02James Scarborough, 2014.16.02TueNight, 2014.16.02Thrillist, 2014.16.02Bess Rowen, 2014.16.02John Feffer, 2014.16.02David Coates, 2014.16.02Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"\u0027THE WORLD\u0027S MOST FEARSOME WEAPON OF MASS DESTRUCTION\u0027",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
