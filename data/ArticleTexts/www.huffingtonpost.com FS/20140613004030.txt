{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Worrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsLindsey Graham\u0027s recent warning that Republicans might yet push for a presidential impeachment serves to demonstrate, if further demonstration was still required, just how brutal Washington politics could get if his party ends up in control of both Houses of Congress after the mid-term elections in November. In progressive terms, the achievements of the Obama administration have been, at best, only modest: and yet that modesty does not remove the need to defend them -- and to defend them energetically -- in the face of sustained Republican attempts to roll them back.Sometimes fears and concerns can move us to take bold steps. Just as we invest in our health and finances as a safety net for the future, we must not leave our friendships to chance. We wouldn\u0027t let our bank account dry up without taking serious action, would we? It\u0027s time to secure the friendships we want today -- and tomorrow!Authors, \u0027Women I Want to Grow Old With\u0027My father handed these jokes down to me because they were handed down to him by his father -- well, maybe not his father; maybe it was his uncle.Comedian and actorWhat is clear is that global climate change is worsening instability and expanding the frequency of events and number of locales in which we count on our military keep the peace.Veteran Army Officer, Former Obama Admin Official at DOD, Truman National Security Project Fellow. MBA Candidate at UC Berkeley Haas SchoolMy son Blair was an honors student. He was the most important thing in my life. And in 2007 a gang member killed him on his way home from school on a public bus with many of his classmates. But to CNN and other media outlets, murders like my son\u0027s don\u0027t count.Chicago Fire Department Battalion ChiefIf conversation is an art, art takes practice. Today, that practice time is used up screen-to-screen, rather than face-to-face or through composing a well-constructed letter. And yet the reports of the death of eloquent expression may be greatly exaggerated.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarAs fathers of daughters and brothers of a combined 16 sisters, we cannot imagine working in a state where women do not have access to safe and affordable health care or the opportunity to plan for their families -- especially when faced with the horrors of rape or incest.Ohio State RepresentativeOhio State RepresentativeI hope that people won\u0027t view the poses as the purpose of yoga. I think yoga is fundamentally about maintaining a steady breath and alignment of the body in all poses (or asanas) in the pursuit of mindfulness.Vice President, Head of Business Development, The Huffington Post\"There are two kinds of people in the world: those who stop at a traffic accident to see if they can help, and those who just drive by.\"Award-winning actress, author and activistI\u0027ve heard things in the aftermath of the election that indeed have made me sad -- not because people didn\u0027t vote for me, but because of why in many cases people said they didn\u0027t vote for me.AuthorThere are legitimate conclusions to be drawn from Cantor\u0027s defeat. Some are self-evident -- like don\u0027t have incompetent pollsters, don\u0027t be inauthentic, and try not to be personally unlikable. But there are also some useful insights to be gained from David Brat\u0027s upset victory, especially for the left.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourI wonder, George, how it feels to have mocked the story of a woman who was raped by a friend whom she asked not to have sex with her?Senior Class President, University of PennsylvaniaIt\u0027s really as simple as making the defaults in your environment work for you rather than against you. That can be a challenging task when there is a processed-food and junk-food carnival at every corner, but today I\u0027m going to show you how you can set yourself up for success.Practicing physicianJames F. Tomsheck\u0027s removal as the U.S. Customs and Border Protection\u0027s chief of internal affairs has raised more alarms about the agency, which has witnessed a dramatic spike in shootings and violence in recent years.Reporter, Center for Investigative ReportingThere is wisdom that comes when a person faces his or her own mortality. The best way to honor the lives that we have lost is to learn from them and make our own lives even better.Pediatrician, Writer, Photographer, Dog Lover and Student of Life.Before we had a kid we didn\u0027t need date nights to have an adult conversation or a meal that lasted more than five minutes. But now, date nights have become a necessity and suddenly, we are back to the pressure of having to carry on a witty conversation, put on cute underwear and have sex.Writer, MomWhile there have been surveys that tell a different story, with at least one reporting that more than 60 percent of Target shoppers aren\u0027t too worried about their data security, the common wisdom now is that a breach can undo years of brand equity -- and that appears to be the case at Target.Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911Benjamin Franklin once said that \"an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,\" yet 279 years later his words still have not been successfully put into medical practice.Public Health Editor, The Huffington Post; Former U.S. Assistant Surgeon GeneralJournalists and pundits are treating this nationalism-inflected populism as if it were somehow a new phenomenon. In fact, this populism can be traced back to the end of the Cold War.Co-director, Foreign Policy In FocusYou\u0027ve been drafted into the American national security state. That much is evident from Edward Snowden\u0027s revelations. Your smartphone? It\u0027s a perfect tracking device if the government needs to find you. Your computer? Hackable and trackable. Your server? It\u0027s at their service, not yours.Retired lieutenant colonel (USAF)Start a conversation with your family, your friends, your coworkers and set boundaries for your smartphone use.Photographer, blogger, and co-founder of The Happy Family Movement and Phone Monsters, Inc.Lengthening the tenure decision process from two to three or even five years will not change the fact that our schools themselves, and the teachers they can afford to hire, vary wildly from district to district, often even from town to town.Public school teacher and writerWriting the perfect Father\u0027s Day card is easy. Writing what I want to say is not.Associate Editor, Huffington Post TravelAs someone who has now personally experienced a tragic, unnecessary death, I worry that the banner of libertarianism too often drowns out rational, middle-of-the road approaches to genuine harms. It is hard to imagine anyone who has lost a relative or dear friend in such a manner to see such innocent deaths as the price of doing business. Indeed, it is downright chilling to suggest this.Professor of medicine, New York University School of Medicine; Author, \u0027The Good Doctor\u0027To help my friends, and anyone else, I\u0027ve come up with a handful of tips regarding web romance decorum. Is my advice subjective? Sure. But in doing research for a book on sex, I\u0027ve also learned a lot about the mating habits of our species. Another inspiration for these recommendations is the way I was courted by my husband, which was exemplary. Then again, he teaches ethics.Writer, performer, and speakerThough improved in some respects, the revived commissions are still characterized by a startling level of secrecy. In an effort to conceal details of defendants\u0027 torture while in CIA custody, the government has designed the commissions to prevent defense teams from obtaining or publicly discussing information about the torture program.Research Associate, Brennan Center for JusticeNo matter what type of physician you may be, and what type of news you are delivering, you become the single most important person in the world to your patients because you are there at the start of their journey, you are at the helm of their survival.Founder, IHadCancer.comThis is it, I stupidly thought. Finally -- someone is coming forward to speak the truth about the ever-shrinking standards set for women in the media. Wrong! Of course. As jaded and cynical as the media has taught me to be, I still have fleeting moments of blissful ignorance.Health WriterHow can you expect us to get on board with the USMNT when the coach doesn\u0027t even believe in them? If I had a chance to counsel Klinsmann on public relations for his team, I could limit it to three words: \"Know your audience.\"President, David PR Group; Partner, WebFactCheck.comStudents Matter proclaimed early and often that one of the chief goals of Vergara was to position PR firm Griffin Schein, since reborn as We Are Rally, as a leader in the Students Mattering space. So pretty much just like Brown vs. Board of Education if Brown was actually a PR campaign bankrolled by a single wealthy individual.Public education advocate and blogger, EduShysterTo see a candidate taking on an incumbent with an astronomical cash advantage, running on a platform in part opposed to money\u0027s influence in the political system, and win is an amazing thing in this day and age. Maybe this is the beginning of a trend in both parties.Senior Fellow at the Bipartisan Policy CenterGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"IRAQ CRACKS",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
