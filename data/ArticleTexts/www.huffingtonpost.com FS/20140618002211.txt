{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Associate Professor of the Practice, Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University, Director, Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland SecurityWhile the headlines from Iraq over the past week are deeply distressing, we cannot lose sight of the fact that they result from long bottled up and unresolved conflicts between Sunni and Shia Muslims in the Middle East and deep-rooted tribal conflicts that have come to the surface due to the combined impacts of globalization, the Arab uprisings, and the ill-advised U.S. invasion of Iraq. There are very large forces at work. Our response should recognize the complexity of the situation with a clear eye on our long term objectives and humility regarding our ability to influence the course of events. One thing, however, is for sure: basing our policies exclusively through the lens of counter terrorism, with the narrow, short-term objective of reducing the possibility of terrorist incidents against us, is likely to worsen the situation and make us even less safe.The welfare state has been dismantled, leaving a much greater number of Americans without a safety net. And the further the public sector retreats from the provision of social services, the more the finance industry steps in to \"help us\" get what we need to get by.Professor and former dean at Milano School of International Affairs, Management, and Urban Policy at The New SchoolSo many young men and women served and sacrificed in Iraq, but that\u0027s not a reason to double down on a failed strategy. I\u0027m glad we\u0027re out of Iraq, we should stay out.Iraq War veteran; former Arizona state representative; candidate for the U.S. Congress representing Arizona\u0027s seventh congressional districtHis show arrived right at the moment when it seemed like America was coming apart, culturally, spiritually, and politically -- and promised us, in a tone that was relentlessly upbeat yet somehow never smarmy, that we actually could be one nation under a groove, that for three or four hours we could share a common bond.Author, \u0027Tear Down This Myth\u0027At its core, legal reasoning is about trying to find insight, or logic, or common sense by comparing different situations and then striving to identify the most important similarities and differences. Analogies open some doors and close others. They shape and direct the analysis.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoWe all are acutely aware that Washington is in a serious jam because of the mounting threat to the Baghdad regime amidst signs of military and political unraveling. The United States is reaping the whirlwind from its 12 years of reckless \"War On Terror\" in the Middle East.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghI don\u0027t know the extent to which Court decisions necessarily reflect the prevailing mood, but if a new gun control bill comes back to Congress later this year, I\u0027m not quite ready to declare it dead.Mike the Gun GuyI had no choice but to become an advocate for maternal health. Four years ago, if it were not for the skilled professionals by my side when I developed an amniotic fluid embolism, I would have died.Global maternal and newborn health advocateScientists estimate that there are over 100,000 intelligent alien civilizations in our galaxy alone--but we\u0027ve never heard anything from any of them. Here are 13 possible explanations for why.www.waitbutwhy.comWe hope more employers will join us in making an investment in tomorrow\u0027s workforce by increasing access to a college degree. We need a new approach from leaders who will join us in taking up the mantle to do the right thing: for our companies, for our communities, for our country.CEO of Starbucks Coffee CompanyPresident of Arizona State UniversityForty-five percent of Americans believe that torture is \"sometimes necessary and acceptable\" in order to \"gain information that may protect the public.\" Twenty-nine percent of Britons \"strongly or somewhat agreed\" that torture was justified when asked the same question. I wonder if they have ever met a victim of torture?AuthorIt\u0027s a federal crime to communicate a true threat of violence in the United States. Such speech is not protected by the First Amendment\u0027s guarantee of free expression. But what exactly constitutes a true threat of violence in the age of Twitter, YouTube and Facebook?Professor and Brechner Eminent Scholar in Mass Communication, University of Florida in GainesvilleReality is that Iran and the US need each other. And both of them need to recognize the other\u0027s ability to play a stabilizing role. Few things have been as destabilizing for the region than the US-Iran enmity.President, National Iranian American CouncilI love seafood -- from succulent scallops to salty anchovies, seafood is an increasingly popular meal in my own home and across the United States. Yet consumers searching for sustainable seafood will find very little information about the seafood they eat.Actor; board member, OceanaCEO, OceanaThe decision to maintain high rates of unemployment is having a devastating impact on the well-being of millions of low- and moderate-income workers and their children.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Calling the war a \"mistake\" is the language of denial, not contrition: it minimizes the Iraq War\u0027s disastrous consequences, removes blame, and deprives Americans of any chance to learn from our generation\u0027s foreign policy disaster.Fmr. 16-year Member of US Congress; Two-time US Presidential CandidateRosa Parks wasn\u0027t some meek old lady or even the \"quiet seamstress\" that history has held her out to be. She was a strong, fierce fighter. And she always was, ever since she was little.Host, The History Channel\u0027s Brad Meltzer\u0027s Decoded; Author of \u0027I Am Rosa Parks\u0027When my son and daughter were both born with Down syndrome, I knew the likelihood of receiving even one college acceptance letter may not be a reality. But the day John received his letter of acceptance from the Special Olympics I experienced the equivalent.Mother of two children with Down SyndromeWhen John Brooks etched his name into American sports history Monday night with a game-winning header to beat Ghana 2-1, it proved once again why the World Cup matters so much. Because what didn\u0027t matter was the fact that the 21-year-old had virtually no international experience or that his coach, Jurgen Klinsmann, was criticized for even including him on the 30-man roster.The Huffington Post\u0027s sports columnist, The Schultz ReportIn this clip from last night\u0027s Tavis Smiley on PBS, Smiley offers his opinion on the cover art for guest Toni Braxton\u0027s latest book, Unbreak My Heart.PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorThe US Chamber of Commerce is wrong, both ethically and operationally. The Chamber\u0027s ethical position is that the US does not have to care about the damages it causes to the rest of the world. This is a special kind of arrogance certainly not unknown in the US corporate sector.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \"To Move the World: JFK\u0027s Quest for Peace\"We broke Iraq. We paid a huge price in lives, treasure and legitimacy. It is time to stop paying.President, Ploughshares Fund; Author, \u0027Nuclear Nightmares: Securing the World Before It Is Too Late\u0027The dirty little secret of corporate America and the practice of diversity is that 25 years after establishing \"diversity\" offices, most companies have not developed a mature understanding of how diversity can contribute to their bottom lines.John Fitzgerald Gates, Ph.D., a national diversity expert, is Principal and Chief Strategist of Criticality Management Consulting.So if happiness is as important a goal in life as American culture makes it seem, we need to understand how age affects it. Only then can we know how to better treat our families, communities, and citizens of all ages.Social Scientist, Duke UniversityWe expect our proposal to be sliced up and rearranged, looking very different to what it is now by the time we present our final business plan in September to Bill Clinton and Muhammad Yunus. Exciting times await us!Hult Prize finalist, HarambeeA piece in the Washington Post highlights the growing backlog of untested rape test kits that are sitting in police storage units while rapists run free and victims suffer. Missing from the story, however, is one of the biggest contributors to this backlog.Drug Policy Alliance, Director of National AffairsMona Lisa\u0027s life spanned the most tumultuous chapters in the history of Florence, decades of war, rebellion, invasion, siege -- and of the greatest artistic outpouring the world has ever seen.Author of MONA LISA: A Life Discovered and LA BELLA LINGUA and a widely published, award-winning freelance journalistThe media message to Clinton was clear last week: You can\u0027t lose your cool when dealing with the press. You can\u0027t try to intimidate reporters. Who is allowed to do all those things? Chris Christie, for one.Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaRecovery takes many forms and has many causes, but the common denominator is realizing the need for change. It\u0027s the most powerful and human ability... to be aware, to choose, to change, to recover (and repeat). It\u0027s essentially the will to grow every day.HuffPost Blog/Third Metric FellowThe facts on domestic gun violence are harrowing: One in four women will be a victim of domestic violence in her lifetime, and further, more than three times as many women are murdered by guns used by their intimate partners than are murdered by strangers using a gun, knife, or any other weaponed combined.U.S. Senator from ConnecticutYoga is a way of giving back.
