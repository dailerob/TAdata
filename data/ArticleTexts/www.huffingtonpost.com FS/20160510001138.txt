{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghThe legal architecture of Obama’s version of the “war on terror” is as resistant to adjudication as was Bush’s more ramshackle structure. How does a defendant prepare a defense when he is denied accusatory evidence on the grounds that it entails ‘state secrets?’ How does a defendant in a non-terrorist case protect himself from the prosecution’s exploitation of evidence obtained without a court warrant when its source is kept secret because it was the fall-out from a national security surveillance case? How does some American citizen on Obama’s \"kill list\" appeal for redress when required to make a personal appearance in a United States court — transit to which might make him vulnerable to murder by American authorities.Maybe he cares so little about learning about what the GI Bill is, because he cares so little about veterans. Most of the money he raised \"for veterans,\" when he bailed on a Republican debate, still hasn\u0027t been given to veterans\u0027 groups.Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranThere\u0027s an eerie silence about the other major climate change threat, which might lower Earth\u0027s average surface temperature by 7°C: a decade-long mini ice age caused by a U.S.-Russia nuclear war.MIT physicist, author of \"Our Mathematical Universe\"All across this country women are being turned away because hospitals are allowing religion to take precedence over medical standards of care. Today one in six U.S. hospital beds is in a facility that abides by the directives.Staff Attorney, ACLU’s Reproductive Freedom ProjectMake no mistake -- NATO is by far the strongest and most capable military alliance in history. But big challenges loom as a new commander takes the reins in Europe. First, he must improve NATO\u0027s cybersecurity. There are still big, gaping holes in NATO\u0027s readiness in the area of offensive cyber action.Supreme Commander of NATO (2009-2013); Dean, Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts UniversityThe Urban Institute and the Tax Policy Center today released analyses of the costs of Sen. Bernie Sanders\u0027 domestic policy proposals, including single-payer national health insurance. They claim that Sanders\u0027 proposals would raise the federal deficit by $18 trillion over the next decade.Professor of Public Health at CUNY and Lecturer in Medicine at Harvard Medical School; Co-founder, Physicians for a National Health ProgramProfessor in the CUNY School of Public Health at Hunter College; Lecturer in Medicine, Harvard Medical School; Co-founder, Physicians for a National Health ProgramThrough the Apple Music subscription, which I had, Apple now deletes files from its users\u0027 computers.Artist, writer, musician, and believer in serial commas.This is not a crisis of numbers; it is a crisis of solidarity. Almost 90 percent of the world\u0027s refugees are hosted in developing countries. Eight countries host more than half the world\u0027s refugees. Just ten countries provide 75 percent of the UN\u0027s budget to ease and resolve their plight.Secretary-General, United NationsFrancis\u0027s dream is of \"a new European humanism\" in which the church plays its role in the religious community, but also promotes dialogue among Christians and people of different faiths.Professor of History of Christianity, University of St. ThomasIt is unfortunate that we were able to book with ease in the past and a simple profile picture change seems to have caused us much trouble. The situation is tough and institutionalized racism appears to be the obvious cause.Traveler, Model, and Writer for www.Followmeaway.comMost parents are unaware of both how common prescription medicine abuse has become in high schools across America, and how easy it is for young people to acquire pills in their own homes and classrooms.Principal, Clifton Consulting LLC; Executive Director, the Center for Safe Internet PharmaciesNorth Carolina Governor Pat McCrory continues to tie himself in knots trying to explain the indefensible House Bill 2, North Carolina\u0027s notorious bathroom law.Director of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel HillWhen we ask \"Who rules the world?\" we commonly adopt the standard convention that the actors in world affairs are states, primarily the great powers, and we consider their decisions and the relations among them. That is not wrong. But we would do well to keep in mind that this level of abstraction can also be highly misleading.Institute Professor emeritus, MIT Department of Linguistics and Philosophy; Author, \u0027Who Rules the World?\u0027The Secretary-General must be candid with the Security Council about what the UN can and cannot do. Too often, United Nations missions are over-ambitious and under-resourced. Such missions harm staff morale, cost lives and damage the credibility of the United Nations.Candidate for UN Secretary-General, former First Deputy Prime Minister of CroatiaThe last thing we need is to see the UN becoming irrelevant. If elected, my role and the role of the future UN administration will be to invest best efforts to reflect the needs of the ever-changing world. Nothing lasts forever but the certainty of change.Candidate of Montenegro for the Position of UN Secretary-GeneralThe question for many Republicans now is how can they embrace a candidate who is not a true conservative, and whose extensive use of personal attacks has dragged the campaign into the gutter?Hofstra Journalism ProfessorIn the case of opioid pain medication, not only is it often not medically indicated to use these medications, but we also take a significant risk each time we prescribe them. We risk our patient developing a dependence or addiction, we risk the medications being diverted or abused, we risk saddling patients with side effects that can be worse than their primary complaint.Writer, Physician, MomToday, yes today, the United States of America maintains the largest system of immigrant detention camps of any nation on the planet. Not North Korea, not Yemen, not the People\u0027s Republic of China, but us. The People of the United States. Have we not learned our lesson?Former Governor of Maryland and Mayor of BaltimoreJust like NAFTA, just like China\u0027s entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), free traders swore that the Korean deal would shower jobs and economic prosperity down on America. It didn\u0027t happen. Actually, the exact opposite did.International President, United Steelworkershe momentum for such a law has been building since the fall, when the Supreme Court of Canada unanimously struck down a criminal ban on the practice.Biochemistry and Political Science Student at Wellesley CollegeEconomics Major at Wellesley CollegeThe private corporations that today \"own\" our public airwaves and fleece American citizens when we seek to borrow them back for electoral purposes are actually broadcast lease-holders who have bid for the right to use the public airwaves in return for a substantial rent and other conditions.Democratic Theorist; Author, \u0027If Mayors Ruled the World\u0027 (Yale University Press); Founder, Global Parliament of MayorsForeign policy should reflect international realities, which change over time. The Republic of Korea was vulnerable to renewed North Korean aggression at the conclusion of the Korean War in 1953. Today, Seoul could do whatever was necessary to deter and defeat the Democratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea. There\u0027s no need for America to defend that which could be defended otherwise.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteDoes the Biggest Loser study prove that weight loss is futile? I don\u0027t believe it does. But it certainly offers a road map for how not to go about it.Board-certified, licensed nutritionist and a professionally-trained chefWhat recourse do traditional conservatives have if they want to trump Trump? For starters, they could just withhold their support, as the Bush family is doing. Or they could withhold money. The trouble, however, is that this is the year when the usual suspects have been revealed as politically impotent.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Confusion makes my job much harder and less rewarding, but -- far more important -- voter confusion is the enemy of a healthy democracy. The need for public confidence in fair and impartial elections is at the very heart of why I choose to volunteer as a poll worker.Freelance Marketing ProfessionalEnvironmental Defense Fund has long argued that methane, that \"other important greenhouse gas,\" should be part of any serious discussion about national and global climate action. This year, we\u0027re finally having that discussion.President of the Environmental Defense FundCriminal justice reform is one of the few legislative issues that could move forward in this highly partisan election year. But this long-awaited reform is in serious danger because of efforts by big corporations and their allies to include a \"get-out-of-jail-free\" card for white collar offenders.Assistant Democratic Leader, U.S. Senator from IllinoisDemocratic Senator from Rhode IslandCongressman from CaliforniaYou could be very successful or make tons of mistakes, and I\u0027m not going anywhere. There is no mistake or decision that would make me go anywhere -- not one. I couldn\u0027t be prouder or love you more.Humor blogger on parenting and life at Wonderoak.com and regular contributor to @motherly.Despite the fact that more Americans than ever want to help, the U.S. government has drastically cut down the acceptance rates of refugees. If Americans were able to sponsor refugees, the response would have very likely put the government\u0027s limited reaction to shame.Director of Immigration Policy, Niskanen CenterTo all who have known and/or will know someone suffering the death of the life they once knew, and to those who\u0027ve been through it or will (so pretty much everyone unless you live alone under a rock), I impart this primer on what I\u0027ve learned thus far.Social Media Director, Writer, MomIf you thought comparison shopping was hard with traditional travel companies, just try the sharing economy. Lightly regulated companies such as Airbnb and Uber can make it as difficult as traditional travel sites — and sometimes even harder — to determine the final price you’ll pay, let alone compare prices on other forms of transportation or accommodations.Author, How to Be the World\u0027s Smartest Traveler (and Save Time, Money, and Hassle)Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
