{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Hillary Clinton is between a rock and a hard place. She was President Obama\u0027s secretary of state, and she is counting on him to provide tacit support for her candidacy. They share many of the same top advisers and Wall Street supporters. At the same time, Clinton needs to distance herself from Obama, and is under pressure from party activists to demonstrate that her embrace of Elizabeth Warren style populist rhetoric is more than window-dressing. Nothing would make this clearer than strong opposition by Clinton to the trade deals. On trade policy, Clinton now finds herself to the right of Mr. Wall Street Democrat, Chuck Schumer. And this is only the first of countless tests of where Clinton really stands -- tests that will keep coming up between now and primary season. If she is presenting herself as a forceful leader, it ill-becomes Clinton to duck.Unless we understand the powerful cultural forces behind the turn to violent extremism, we will fail to address the threat. When, as now, the focus is on military solutions and police interdiction, matters have already gone way too far. If that focus remains, we lose the coming generation.Anthropologist; Author, \u0027Talking to the Enemy: Faith, Brotherhood, and the (Un)Making of Terrorists\u0027A nation\u0027s refusal to come to grips with its past is more a sign of weakness, than of strength. Making peace with your past makes you stronger and more able to deal with future challenges. The inability to do so, is disturbing, to say the least. Denial and bullying the victim only delays the recognition that must ultimately come.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027If Bruce had told me about his gender issue when we first began getting romantically involved, I would not have married him. Pure and simple. But looking back, I\u0027m so grateful to God, the universe, and Bruce that I didn\u0027t know, and that Bruce played the role in my life that he did.Actress, Songwriter, Television PersonalityCan reasonable people disagree about the issues at hand in the TPP and TTIP? Absolutely. The president is wrong to suggest that his supporters in Congress and beyond are irresponsible when they question these agreements -- particularly given that his administration continues to keep them classified as a \"national security\" matter.Associate Professor of Law, Yale Law SchoolGays and lesbians have been subjected to a long history of invidious discrimination, sexual orientation is not a matter of choice, gays and lesbians have consistently had their interests dismissed and overridden in the political process, and sexual orientation has nothing to do with an individual\u0027s ability to perform in society.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoEnter Scott Walker\u0027s politics of fear. For the party that rhetorically champions self-reliance, the emphasis on creating fear and despair in the electorate is ironic, but effective. Why blame yourself for economic insecurity when you can blame a faceless immigrant plotting to take away your job?Univision America Host \u0026 contributor to NPR, The Hill, FoxNews Latino and other mediaIf America ends up at war, it almost certainly will be on behalf of one ally or another. Washington collects allies like most people collect Facebook \"friends.\" The vast majority of U.S. allies are security liabilities, tripwires for conflict and war. Alliances should be based on interest, not charity.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteThe Greater Europe project, which many politicians, experts and opinion makers from many European countries have been trying to promote since mid-1980s, now looks like a fantasy completely detached from reality. Neither Russia nor Europe can afford a new \"Cold War.\"Poet, Prime Minister of France from 2005-2007Poet, Prime Minister of France from 2005-2007I want to caution that for all the drama, excitement, enthusiasm and analysis sparked by the political dimension of the marriage equality debate, there is also a deeply personal dimension that is easy to overlook. It is the collateral damage of systemic homophobia that accelerates when marriage equality is in the news cycle.Episcopal priest and activist from Pasadena, Calif.Progressives around the country, working on a variety of issues, have embraced the new May Day movement. It isn\u0027t just about workers rights on the job, or immigrant rights, or civil rights, or even about raising the standard of living for all workers. It\u0027s about what kind of country we want to be.E.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeA very large gas pipeline will soon skirt the Indian Point Energy Center (IPEC), an aging nuclear power plant that stands in the town of Cortlandt in Westchester County, New York, 30 miles north of Manhattan. Experts say a disaster as great as or greater than Fukushima could be triggered by a potential gas explosion at the nuclear complex.Boston-based journalistI\u0027m always wary of the argument that all problems can and should be solved at home. I think that takes some of the responsibility off of other institutions that can bring about social change yet drastically need reform. But the role of parents and families is an important one -- particularly in the prevention of racial discrimination.University Chaplain, University of PennsylvaniaAfter realizing last week that, as a woman, I apologize for nearly everything and to nearly everyone, my first instinct was to ask Google why. I typed the words \"why do women,\" but before I could add \"apologize,\" I was amazed at what Google suggested I ask instead.Senior Editor, Los AngelesAt every LGBTQ training I give, people are the most interested in one thing: trans people. So what is transgender? It\u0027s a persistent feeling that your gender does not match the sex you were assigned at birth. Evidence leads us to believe we are about .5 percent of the population, or one in every 200 people.Director of LGBT HealthLinkYou might become a marathoner someday, or you might join the legions of enthusiastic, mud-covered, obstacle course racers. But that\u0027s not why you\u0027re reading this blog. Right now, let\u0027s just focus on getting out the door and into the fresh air.Educational Consultant and RunnerIf you are at all interested in astronomy, chances are you\u0027ve already heard that the Hubble Space Telescope is celebrating its 25th anniversary this week. What some people may not know is that Hubble is one of four siblings, so to speak.Visualization Lead, NASA\u0027s Chandra X-ray ObservatoryI don\u0027t see the contradiction in embracing the good Jenner has done, while respectfully asking \"What the heck?\" on his apparently discordant politics -- not to enforce liberal orthodoxy, but to encourage self-reflection in someone who has a unique public platform.Partner, Kramer Levin Naftalis \u0026 Frankel LLPAt the end of the day, it all comes down to how we handle it. Our ability (or inability) to live in reality and deal with change can say a lot about us and our outlook on life. And unbeknownst to many, it can also be indicative of how successful we will be and how far life will take us.Cy Wakeman is a speaker, New York Times bestselling author and trainer who has cultivated a reality-based approach to work/life challenges.Some of the nation\u0027s most vulnerable families are headed by young parents, many who juggle poverty-level wages and social shaming. From homelessness and housing insecurity to violence and abuse, these young families face hardships that should be at the top of our nation\u0027s agenda.Associate professor and medical anthropologist, UMass AmherstAnthropologist, writer, professorWordsmith, photo nerd, sitcom junkie, dog lover, and Editor at 500px. Everything I ever needed to know I learned from Calvin and Hobbes.If you want something you need to go out and get it, and for me dating is the same as anything else. I love my life, and have lots going on, but would like to share it with someone, and so I\u0027m a prolific dater. However, I\u0027m still looking, and have heard every explanation under the sun.Blogger, Entrepreneur, Columnist.As a young professional, there are things I wish someone would have given me a heads up about during the job search and interview process. Sometimes simple mistakes are putting qualified candidates at the bottom of the barrel.TV Advertising Professional, Avid Cupcake Eater, and Baseball Wife NewbieIn these dire times of unethical decision-making by policy makers, it\u0027s important that teachers remain grounded in moral principles that have proven timeless in preserving the promise of public education. It has been painfully evident that union leadership has settled for political maneuvering rather than unwavering principle.New York City Public School Teacher. The opinions I present are my own.If emojis were designed to save time in digital communication, in addition to releasing more diverse options it would have been nice to see 15 still-missing emojis that are part of many females\u0027 regular texting vocabulary.Publisher at Tidbits Media GroupPretty enough for an Italian pastry shop window, this is one light and creamy cheesecake. Sweet, smooth and oh so delicious. Don\u0027t be intimidated: Anyone can make these creamy creations.Chef, Recipe Developer, Busy MomOn paper, he looked like the ideal hire. Ivy League education. Top-notch work experience. Strong referrals. Rationally, all signs suggested I should hire him. And yet, I felt what can only be described as a \"tap on the shoulder\" -- an intuitive, but impossible-to-pinpoint feeling that something was off.Founder \u0026 CEO of JetBystanders often ask the obvious question: If they knew they shouldn\u0027t, and they wished they hadn\u0027t, then why did they?A community of experts, bloggers and \"divorced moms\"With most vegetables there is always a part we throw away -- from the tops of fennel to the stems of beets. And while sometimes we make use of them in stock, chef Steven Satterfield of Atlanta\u0027s Miller Union believes there\u0027s more to these throwaways than meets the eye.Founder and Host, Potluck VideoTrans visibility might be increasing in everyday society but this trend is not translating to the sports world in the same way it has for LGB players. Out-of-date policies have to be combated, dismantled and replaced with policies that respect transgender identities.Director of Policy \u0026 Campaigns, Athlete AllyI recently reached out to fitness expert Joel Harper to get his take on training for a half-marathon. And you know what? He says you can do it, too.
