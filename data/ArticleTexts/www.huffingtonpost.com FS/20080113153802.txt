{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOThis was the week of the near tear, the hot button iron, and the polls that couldn\u0027t count straight. The tape of Hillary\u0027s choke up was analyzed more closely than the Zapruder film, with the media parsing each quiver of her lip with Talmudic intensity. Waterworks might have cost Ed Muskie New Hampshire in \u002772, and delivered it to Clinton 36 years later. Or maybe it was Hillary\u0027s standing ovation-inducing retort to the \"iron my shirt\" hecklers: \"Oh, the remnants of sexism are alive and well.\" Take that, chauvinist shock jock pigs! As for the pollsters, they were as accurate in their prediction of an Obama cakewalk as the neocons were in predicting one in Iraq. To battle the pollsters\u0027 chronic inaccuracy, HuffPost has launched a Say No to Pollsters petition.

Fox\u0027s Garrett told me he\u0027d \"take it under advisement.\" Take it under advisement?Read Post | Comments (350)BIOGary Hart, 01.09.2008For those who have had power and seek to recapture it, they can claim to be for change but they cannot bring it about because there are too many old arrangements, too many deals, too many old networks.Read Post | Comments (451)BIOChris Kelly, 01.07.2008Romney has the power to reverse- insinuate. Sometimes when he directly says something, it turns out he\u0027s really just hinting. He can unsay things by saying them. Don\u0027t ask me how that\u0027s possible.Read Post | Comments (137)BIOArianna Huffington, 01.07.2008Clinton and her surrogates are attacking from every direction, hoping something will stick. The attacks are as varied as they are contemptible. Let\u0027s take a look at the dirty laundry list.Read Post | Comments (1052)BIOLawrence O\u0027Donnell, 01.11.2008If John Edwards stays in the race, he might, in the end, become nothing other than the Southern white man who stood in the way of the black man. And for that, he would deserve a lifetime of liberal condemnation.Read Post | Comments (872)BIOJane Smiley, 01.11.2008O\u0027Donnell attacks the only candidate with explicitly progressive policy positions, and the only candidate who understands how corporations are poisoning American politics and American life.Read Post | Comments (422)BIOStephen Schlesinger, 01.12.2008Clinton is the only candidate in either party who has come forward with serious remedies for a grave downturn in the American economy. This is policy over pizzazz.Read Post | Comments (167)BIOHarry Shearer, 01.09.2008There are stories of hope and progress, and of delay and betrayal in New Orleans. None of them worthy of a mention as candidates left and right outlined their visions for the future last night.Read Post | Comments (73)BIOJamie Lee Curtis, 01.11.2008Why are we so surprised that Hilary Clinton has a heart? It was a real moment, tears or not, and it seemed to cut through the bullshit that accompanies most answers on the campaign trail.Read Post | Comments (332)BIOAndy Borowitz, 01.08.2008Mr. Clinton\u0027s attacks on Obama have become more scathing in recent days, but few expected his rhetorical attacks to turn into outright vandalism.Read Post | Comments (33)BIOGary Hirshberg, 01.11.2008As businesspeople, we need to strive to be just as efficient in handling waste as nature is.Read Post | CommentsBIOBob Cesca, 01.09.2008Sen.
