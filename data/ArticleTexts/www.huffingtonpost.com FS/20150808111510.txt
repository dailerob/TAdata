{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor of Literature, Yale UniversityChuck Schumer has often said, with an artless self-love, that his name in Hebrew, \"shomer,\" means \"guardian\"; and he takes pride in the fact because he thinks of himself as the appointed guardian of Israel\u0027s interests in the US. How bizarre and unprecedented this is! Think of any other nation in the world. Imagine an Italian-American named Frank Consiglieri assuring his listeners that his name means \"advocate\" in Italian and he is supremely vigilant for the interests of Italy as a lawmaker in the US. Schumer voted for the Iraq war on a rationale similar to the one he now urges as the path of reason and good sense with Iran. He may or may not recognize that he is only assisting the Likud and the neoconservatives with part three of the Middle East \"clean break\" strategy: Iraq, Syria, Iran.I watched the debates last night with two questions in mind: Who would give Hillary Clinton a run for her money? And who would be a good and useful vice-presidential running mate? Both lists are surprisingly short.Davidson-Kahn Distinguished University Professor and Professor of Law at Florida International University; Floershimer Distinguished Visiting Professor of Law at Cardozo Law SchoolWhile I, too, mourn the killing of Cecil the Lion in Zimbabwe, it revives in me an uncomfortable memory. Some 50 years ago, I went on my first (and only) wild-game hunt -- the most stupid thing I\u0027ve ever done.Actor, author of 10 books and a book of poems \"Life Could Be Verse” published by HCI, December 2014Trainwreck is predictable in part because it\u0027s Hollywood, but if you peel away the layers, it sends a message that is not at all untrue. Even--spoiler alert--Amy learns about her own double standards.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarThe best option to stop Iran from building a nuclear bomb and the best option to avoid another war in the Middle East is this deal.Senior Member of the Senate Foreign Relations CommitteeNow that was a debate. Back in 2012 it was the live audience that got rowdy at the presidential primary debates. This time it was the folks onstage, candidates and moderators alike. And somehow it all stemmed from the presence of Donald Trump, the spiritual epicenter of this event, whose outsize persona dominated the proceedings from beginning to end.Professor of Journalism, Northeastern University, BostonIf the Republican circus of presidential candidates manages to persuade -- by the regular repetition of inadequate and ill-informed talking points -- that the route to future U.S. economic prosperity and national security is through ever more military belligerence abroad, then we are on the way to yet more wars.Worrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsNews organizations love anniversary stories, and if for some reason you haven\u0027t heard, it\u0027s the 70th anniversary of when the United States dropped two atomic bombs on Japan. Despite all this coverage, however, I didn\u0027t notice any stories that bothered to mention the fact that the Obama administration wants the U.S. government to spend as much as $1 trillion over the next three decades on a new generation of nuclear weapons.Senior Writer, Union of Concerned ScientistsIn the Republican debate, Americans got a glimpse at what their economic future might hold if one of the Republican candidates becomes president -- and the picture wasn\u0027t pretty.Founding Co-director, Social Security WorksBasic respect and human decency--just plain kindness--can go a long way in building self-esteem in our children and helping a young person in crisis make it to the next step.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundFor every Jewish man in New York in our database, there are 3.5 Jewish women. So think of it as a Shabbat dinner, where there are two single Jewish guys, and seven women vying for their attention.CEO, Dating RingRecent bilateral discussions involving Americans, Russians, Saudis, and others that there may be a renewed push for negotiations to end the conflict in Syria. It should have been clear from the beginning that a negotiated solution is the only way to end this long war.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027We applaud Gov. Cuomo for temporarily instituting a special prosecutor to investigate tragedies like Raynette Turner\u0027s death. But we find it necessary to highlight a glaring question: Is it reasonable to keep a visibly sick mother of eight in jail for two days because she allegedly stole food?Founder of Garner Way Foundation and daughter of Eric GarnerPolitical Director for Garner Way FoundationSome juvenile detention centers may double as holding places for abused children, but they remain juvenile detention centers nonetheless. I am all too familiar with this phenomenon because, like the Tsimhoni children, my sister and I were incarcerated in a juvenile detention center for refusing to see our father at the age of 14.Activist and writerWhat the Fed is about to do will affect your job and your income, and here\u0027s what you can do to make sure the Fed makes the right decision.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027It was hard enough to get the right to vote and own property and make decisions about our own bodies. Now we seriously have to defend the idea that \"women\u0027s health issues\" are important enough to merit 0.0001 percent of the federal budget?Actress, Activist, People For the American Way Foundation Board MemberYou really believed that you were being much more open-minded, much more attuned to the Latino community than Trump could ever be. But see, that\u0027s the thing with microaggresions; you think you\u0027re being helpful, but in reality, you\u0027re not. At. All.Writer and editor.Today\u0027s topics include Chez on Stephanie Miller\u0027s Happy Hour; farewell to Jon Stewart and the end of late night satire; the first GOP debate; the fake story about drinking games; Fox News focus group goes nuts about Trump and much more.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027What will finally defeat Trump is not likely to be the Donald himself, but the combined might of the people who control the Republican party: Mainly the Koch brothers and those, both politicians and other big money players, who trail in their wake.Co-Founder, Democracy PartnersThis is probably the greatest domestic challenge of the coming years, especially for Europe, which is currently failing to respond. It is an absolute shame that many countries in the European Union only want to receive a very small number of refugees, or none at all.Chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, Vice-Chancellor and Federal MinisterThese cakes may look complicated, but they\u0027re surprisingly easy to make.Chef, Recipe Developer and Busy MomNetflix made a giant leap ahead of 99 percent of corporate America this week when it announced an unlimited first year leave policy for new parents. We can only hope other companies hop on this bandwagon. But a bigger question is why access to family leave has to depend on where you work.Money Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsRecently five Republican presidential candidates paraded themselves before a group of mega-donors convened by the billionaire Koch brothers in Dana Point, California. The interests of the big-money donors were reflected in Thursday\u0027s debate - in what we did and didn\u0027t hear.WriterI believe that the willingness to be oneself, one\u0027s true self, openly in public is a scary thing for anyone. Honesty in the face of adversity is a form of moral strength. For transgender people, being \"out\" can be downright dangerous.Judge and Transgender role model.The U.S. is one of only four countries in the world -- along with Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Papua New Guinea -- that does not guarantee the right to paid maternity leave. The Family and Medical Leave Act requires companies with more than 50 employees to give new parents up to 12 weeks off -- but that\u0027s without pay.An OpenTable blog featuring tips, resources and fresh ideas for running a successful restaurant.Bernie Sanders can win--not just the primary, but the general. Democrats should back him, and ignore the arguments made by Barney Frank and others, who say giving Hillary the nod early is the only hope for victory in 2016.Cartoonist and bloggerThe move away from conventional politics doesn\u0027t represent a shift by the electorate towards political extremism, rather a growing frustration at the ruling political class. As Trump said recently, people are tired of \"incompetent politicians.\" The political class may scoff, but it\u0027s Trump leading the polls.Night Editor, The Huffington Post UKBy failing to push back against implacable refusal from the Egyptian side to engage in honest discussion about countering terrorism while protecting human rights, John Kerry handed the Sisi regime the seal of approval from the United States that it was seeking.International Policy Adviser for Human Rights FirstI don\u0027t know how else to say this. Wiccans don\u0027t practice ritual murders. Wiccans don\u0027t practice ritual murders. Wiccans don\u0027t practice ritual murders, okay? How are we in 2015 and still trying to make this clear? I\u0027m scratching my head over here. Okay, I lied. I\u0027m banging it against my desk. Or at least, I was until I stopped to type you this letter.Priestess, writer and activistWhy am I terrified? Because the prospect and potential that this represents means a world without discussion and without ideas. It means a world in which we have to be careful of what we say for fear of not getting that loan, job, or education.Richard Zombeck is a freelance writer for hire and a contributor to www.nowitcounts.comSo many of the people I met and befriended had either never met a Jewish person before in their life, or else there were two Jewish people in their high school/they once dated a Jewish guy and felt they understood the culture.Human Resources and Operations manager at SUM InnovationGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
