READ MOREIntroducing HuffPost Divorce I\u0027ve always thought that, as a country, we do a lousy job of addressing how we can do divorce differently -- and better. Especially when there are children involved. That\u0027s why I\u0027m so excited about the launch of HuffPost Divorce. READ MOREWATCH: Arianna Discusses Debt Commission, Obama\u0027s Overseas Trip on Parker/SpitzerRead Post | CommentsCecile Richards, 11.12.2010President, Planned Parenthood Action FundIt\u0027s pretty clear that the new majority in the House won\u0027t be putting women in leadership positions. If the Democrats are serious about winning in 2012, they need to pay attention to women -- as voters and as leaders.Read Post | CommentsLawrence Lessig, 11.12.2010Professor of Law, Harvard Law SchoolAs a \"free culture warrior,\" I was a bit surprised to learn that, according to David Wallace-Wells in The Nation, I was in the business of \"exhort[ing others] to piracy.\" Was I now, and had I always been, a pirate? There\u0027s a fallacy at the core of this argument.Read Post | CommentsAlec Baldwin, 11.13.2010ActorI want to recommend forgetting to anyone who feels the insatiable need to pick up a pen, or a phone, and attack someone who is now, essentially, just a part of your past. And, maybe, a part that helped to get you where you are today.Read Post | CommentsRichard Grenell, 11.12.2010Longest serving U.S. Spokesman in the history of the United NationsObama has shown that he is all too willing to sacrifice American security for his personal popularity.Read Post | CommentsDavid Katz, M.D., 11.13.2010Dr. Katz is the Director of Yale University\u0027s Prevention Research CenterAn overwhelming body of research shows what dietary patterns do produce lasting good health -- all emphasize wholesome, mostly plant foods direct from nature. None emphasizes Ho Hos.Read Post | CommentsJames Zogby, 11.13.2010President of the Arab American Institute, Author of \"Arab Voices\" (Palgrave Macmillan 10/10)Israel\u0027s announcement, last week, of a radical expansion of Har Homa (an already massive settlement community between Jerusalem and Bethlehem) makes a mockery of the so-called \"peace process.\"Read Post | CommentsCharles Ferguson, 11.12.2010Director of the Wall Street documentary \u0027Inside Job\u0027The United States is now in the grip of a political duopoly in which both parties are thoroughly complicit. The current arrangement all but guarantees the continuing decline of the United States as a nation.Read Post | CommentsRussell Simmons, 11.12.2010Founder of GlobalGrind.comFor centuries, our people have relentlessly tread water as hard as they could to stay afloat, and here we were, literally drowning, and it felt like the president was insensitive. There is no need to apologize, Kanye.Read Post | CommentsMohammed Khaishgi, 11.13.2010CEO of a global technology holding companyDuring his recent visit to India, President Obama made it clear that the United States would not take a pro-active role in mediating the Kashmir issue between India and Pakistan. That would be a grave oversight from a U.S. national security perspective.Read Post | CommentsJane Smiley, 11.12.2010Pulitzer Prize-Winning Novelist and EssayistWhen I asked my older daughter what she thought of my divorce from her father (she is 32), she said, \"Do you really think I wish we had remained in that suffocating little four-person family?\"Read Post | CommentsCenk Uygur, 11.12.2010Host of The Young TurksGlenn Beck has told a lie so grotesque that it goes beyond the pale of even dirty politics. Just when I thought he couldn\u0027t shock my conscience anymore, he has done it. Let me explain.Read Post | CommentsRichard (RJ) Eskow, 11.12.2010Consultant, Writer, Senior Fellow with The Campaign for America\u0027s FutureSo-called \"deficit hawks\" like Kent Conrad, Erskine Bowles, and Alan Simpson aren\u0027t just unserious. They\u0027re radicals. Their positions are an extreme departure from the philosophy of government that\u0027s guided American policy for a century.Read Post | CommentsKatherine Marshall, 11.13.2010Senior Fellow, Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs at Georgetown UniversityI am completely convinced that until women are more than token members of any movement and institution, there will never be peace or action on environment or real action on poverty.Read Post | CommentsRep. Brad Miller, 11.12.2010Representative, North CarolinaSocial Security, and the long-term deficit are completely distinct. Proposing to \"reform\" Social Security because of long-term deficits is like invading Iraq because Afghanistan attacked us.Read Post | CommentsLila Shapiro, 11.12.2010Associate Blog EditorWhere does Ames end and his character begin? He says, \"Jonathan the character is wonderfully more brave and delusional than I am, which enables him to take on things that he shouldn\u0027t.\"Read Post | CommentsRichard T. Hughes, 11.13.2010Author, \u0027Christian America and the Kingdom of God\u0027The Second Great Awakening and the Fundamentalist Movement sought to transform the United States into a distinctly Christian nation and, in that way, paved the way for the Christian Right of our own time.Read Post | CommentsSteve Clemons, 11.11.2010Publisher of \"The Washington Note\"I can\u0027t help wondering whether Cindy McCain misses her straight-talking husband as much as I do -- a McCain that is going to be relevant to our future, not one we have to be ashamed of because he \"delayed\" the normalization of gay rights.Read Post | CommentsRabbi Shmuley Boteach, 11.12.2010Rabbi and writerLost in the debate about the morality of the Tea Party is any discussion about its underpinnings in human nature. The Tea Party is far from perfect, but in emphasizing self-reliance, it taps into the human desire to live a life with self-esteem.Read Post | CommentsSimon Johnson, 11.12.2010MIT Professor and co-author of 13 BankersVikram Pandit heads Citigroup, one of the world\u0027s largest and most powerful banks. He\u0027s a smart individual -- why then does he advance such obviously specious arguments? The answer is straightforward: he can get away with it.Read Post | CommentsAmitai Etzioni, 11.12.2010GWU ProfessorWhen no raindrops follow the rainmakers\u0027 dance, they claim the dance was not properly performed. Our generals are using the same rationale to keep our engagement going in Afghanistan.Read Post | CommentsClaire Gordon, 11.12.2010Yale graduate studentNostalgia is not a reason to resist technology. It\u0027s a feeling with an imaginary object: a simpler time that wasn\u0027t really simpler, family bliss that wasn\u0027t really blissful, community that was really just as frayed as now.Read Post | CommentsLes Leopold, 11.12.2010Author, \"The Looting of America\"The real mystery of our current economic mess is how quiet progressives are. We seem constitutionally incapable of facing the enormity of the employment crisis. Why? Part of the answer lies in our permanent attachment to the Democratic Party.Read Post | CommentsClarence B. Jones, 11.12.2010Scholar in Residence, Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute at Stanford UniversityThe White House is stuck in some parallel universe disconnected from reality. They still think the president\u0027s problem was one of developing a more effective way of communicating his message. The problem is the message, not it\u0027s communication.Read Post | CommentsRob Johnson, 11.12.2010Director of Economic Policy, Roosevelt Institute, NewDeal2.0These are money party recommendations from a Commission appointed by two money parties that survive on money to conjure votes through media expenditure in a money politics distorted framework.Read Post | CommentsDave Zirin, 11.12.2010Sports correspondent for the Nation MagazineLebron has in the past expressed his admiration of Ali. This new ad, though, is like expressing your admiration for Dr. King by launching \"I Have A Dream Cereal\" or a laxative called \"We Shall Not Be Moved.\"Read Post | CommentsMark Joseph, 2010.11.13Virginia M.
