While LGBT obviously oppose these laws, most of the criticism has come from CEOs of the nation\u0027s leading companies. It is encouraging that CEOs have taken an active role in this debate.

Speaking publicly against discrimination is the first step in that process.Rather than fight the matzah, I\u0027m going to lean in to it, as it were.
