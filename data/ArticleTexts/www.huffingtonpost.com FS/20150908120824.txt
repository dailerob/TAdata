{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The mounting catastrophe of Syrian refugees in Europe is one part the same old same old, \"not in my backyard,\" but with several new wrinkles. One is the complete paralysis of the European Union as a government able to take emergency action. The humanitarian crisis is happening right now in real time, but the EU operates by consensus if not unanimity and it operates with agonizing slowness. Several nations don\u0027t want anything to do with refugees. Hungary\u0027s brutal response is more candid and ugly than others, but in this story there are few heroes. One hero is the Prime Minister of Sweden, Stefan Löfven. Sweden has been more generous to refugees and immigrants than most nations, and now faces a backlash.Kentucky Clerk Kim Davis Becomes an Anti-Gay Martyr; Huckabee, Cruz and Eric Erickerick Rush to Davis\u0027 Defense; Rand Paul\u0027s App is Spying on You; Trump Attacks Jeb Bush for Speaking Spanish; and much more.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027Labor Day is a time for honoring the working people of this country. It is a time to celebrate the accomplishments of the activists and organizers who fought for the 40-hour work week, occupational safety protection and other workplace rights. These working people resisted the oligarchs of their day, fought for a more responsive democracy, and built the middle class.U.S. Senator from VermontEvery year I speak to the families of new students at Wesleyan University just before they say goodbye and we start our semester. Having just dropped off my daughter (far from home) as she starts her first year in college, this was particularly poignant for me.President, Wesleyan UniversityThe Republican appropriations bills are stacked with ideological provisions known as \"riders\" that are unrelated to spending levels and weaken basic protections for workers, the backbone of our economy.Director of the Office of Management and BudgetThe sobering truth of the matter is that Canada\u0027s refugee policy is not generous at all, neither compared to other countries today, nor compared to that most famous refugee destination historically, the Canada of the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s.Writer, activist, J.D. candidate at Yale Law School.Anderson writes that Kim Davis didn\u0027t need to go to jail if only we\u0027d made \"accommodations\" for state employees like her in the way that he says North Carolina did earlier this year by passing a law shielding those employees. And he holds that problematic law up as a model.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostEuropeans are facing an extraordinary challenge that inevitably elicits humanitarian, moral and ethical soul-searching, but also poses real political and security questions. I can only sympathize with them as they wrestle with this complex challenge.Former President, East Timor, 1996 Nobel Peace Prize laureateThis widely reported \"official\" number overlooks the millions of people unemployed for more than a year, nor does it count those who are working part-time and looking for full-time work. The Department of Labor monthly report which includes people working part-time and looking for full-time work shows the real rate of unemployment.Law Professor, Loyola University New Orleans, CCR Associate Legal DirectorHere\u0027s the question that must be asked: Why are we questioning Marissa Mayer\u0027s personal decision about how to balance her work and family lives when too few people have this option at all? The last time a male CEO was asked questions about how he would balance having a new baby and with work was never.Executive Director/CEO and Co-Founder of MomsRising.orgLast week, President Obama made the most extensive presidential visit to Alaska ever. He hiked on a glacier, met with Native Alaskans, and became the first president ever to visit the Arctic Circle. Throughout, he was calling attention to the real, on-the-ground effects of climate change.Executive Director, The Sierra ClubInstead of picnicking, Steelworkers in six states will spend this Labor Day picketing the gates of a dozen Allegheny Technologies Inc. (ATI) specialty mills. These 2,200 Steelworkers are not on strike. They never even took a strike vote to threaten a walkout. ATI locked them out of their jobs.International President, United SteelworkersThe closet seems like a vestige from a darker time. Many young LGBT people never experienced the repression, but there is an older generation of men who closed the door decades ago and now find themselves tentatively stepping out into a terrifying world. They often feel alone.Writer and Blogger, \u0027The Authentic Life\u0027Job or not, this Labor Day, I stand with working women -- with Tracy and Raven and Adriana -- who are fighting for the most basic right of all: the right to have a life and make a living.Columnist, Waging Nonviolence; author of \"It Runs in the Family: On Being Raised by Radicals and Growing into Rebellious Motherhood\"The Republican presidential primary spectacle is the beginning of electoral anarchy. The same disruptive conditions and forces that are bedeviling Republicans this primary season are likely to discombobulate future Democratic presidential primaries and to morph inevitably into general election anarchy.Founder, Democracy AllianceSo here you go: The top five things that occurred when I stopped complaining, both the good and the bad.Author. Blogger. Adventurer. And everything in-between.In a country where wages have been held down by powerful corporations for decades, and where 42 percent of working people are now paid less than $15 an hour, a growing desire to raise wages is inevitable.International Executive Vice President, Property Services Division, Service Employees International UnionThe first is a pillar of the \"realist\" camp in the American national security establishment. The second is a rising star in the Democratic Party from a heavily Jewish district in South Florida. Together, they represent key constituencies whose support for the historic accord is critical to isolating right-wing opponents and preventing last-minute sabotage attempts.President, Ploughshares Fund; Author, \u0027Nuclear Nightmares: Securing the World Before It Is Too Late\u0027For Gov. Huckabee to invoke the example of murdered, black Martin Luther King Jr. to rally against a movement that identifies itself as Black Lives Matter is at its simplest thoughtlessness to the point of dangerousness. Do good intentions trump negative impact? Not when the impact is on you.Dismantling racism from the inside outOne could hardly blame liberal Jews for wanting to celebrate AIPAC\u0027s defeat or for some Israeli\u0027s to lament what they called \"Netanyahu\u0027s strategic blunder\". Both views, however, are naïve and shortsighted. On several levels, Netanyahu won.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Now it seems that the GOP right is faced with having to come up with a new formula. There is really little chance that enough of the country (or let alone even Republican voters) will remain entertained, amused, gratified by Trump, or Carson for that matter.Louise Hewlett Nixon Professor, Stanford UniversityWomen are unlikely to ask priests to forgive us for having an abortion. But we should welcome a conversation with Pope Francis about providing relief from the damage Catholics and others suffer as a result the Church\u0027s obstinately backwards position of recent decades.Co-Director, Center for Policy AnalysisHowever, one of the best ways to keep the side effects of aging at bay may be something anyone can do, for free: get better sleep. The more we learn about rest and biology, the clearer it is that sleep plays an important role in keeping skin, bodies and minds young. In fact, it may be one of the most effective things you can do.Entrepreneur, CEO at One Mall GroupThe essence of this special day is about acknowledging the strength, skill, persistence and even artistry demonstrated every time any job is done well. It\u0027s something we too readily forget in a world that seems to be more and more dominated by fame, fortune and reality television.REDF President and CEOClearly not all experts or genetics researchers are inclined to take the low road by participating in such ethically unacceptable activities.Professor of Cell Biology and Anatomy, New York Medical CollegeIt\u0027s not a party without chips and dip. From Chile Con Queso to Roasted Garlic Guacamole, these flavorful recipes are all serious crowd-pleasers.Chef, Recipe Developer and Busy MomGiven the high rate of sexual assault by athletes, colleges have an enhanced duty to ensure that athletes are not given special privileges exempting them from federal legal mandates. It is high time that athletic departments and colleges enforced Title IX, fully.Legal Momentum is a nonprofit legal advocacy organization dedicated to advancing and defending the rights of women and girls since 1970.I don\u0027t get angry about immigration, legal or otherwise, or about women in power, or about people with Asian or Spanish accents trying to make lives for themselves or their families in the United States.This is, old angry people, the future of America. You can rage against it and try to build fences and you may win in the very short run. But in the long run, you will lose.Journalist/ProducerHere\u0027s a tip for all you professional scoffers sneering at Trump\u0027s chances of winning the nomination, and should he pull that off, disparage as laughable the thought of a victory in the general. Just remember... they said the same thing about Ronald Reagan.Political comic, former radio talk show host, syndicated columnist, author, motivational speakerPolitical leaders preaching intolerance express the collective\u0027s shadow by projecting their own grandiosity, moral superiority, paranoia, and retaliatory policies toward those deemed other or not normal.Alan Briskin is an award-winning author, artist, and leadership consultant. His most recent book, the co-authored The Power of Collective Wisdom: And the Trap of Collective Folly, was the winner of the Nautilus Book Award in the category of Conscious Business and Leadership.Israel\u0027s multiple fault lines -- secular vs. religious, Jewish vs. Palestine and controversial calls for a boycott of the Jewish state -- are exploding on the soccer pitch.Senior fellow, S.
