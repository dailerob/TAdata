{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"From img.epochtimes.comFrom zdf.deIn a \"Dear Republican\" e-mail this week (yes, I still get them!), RNC Chair Ken Mehlman suggested I host a State of the Union House Party on January 31, when the president, according to Ken, will be \"laying out his bold agenda for the coming year\". Sounds fun. The only thing missing are some party games, so here are a few suggestions: Beat the Speaker! This game requires fast reflexes, as you see who amongst your partygoers can best anticipate when Speaker of the House Denny Hastert will spring (sort of) to his feet and start one of the many \"spontaneous\" standing ovations that\u0027ll undoubtedly occur during the president\u0027s speech. Every time you beat Denny to his feet, you score a point!READ POST | comments (15)01.13.2006 Harry ShearerThe Times Picayune continues its march towards a Pulitzer, today revealing that independent investigators are troubled about the Corps of Engineers\u0027 work on the rebuilding of failed floodwalls.READ POST | comments01.13.2006 Susie BrightWhy does feminine self-loathing seem to be going over the edge?
