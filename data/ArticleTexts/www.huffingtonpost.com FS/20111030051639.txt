{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Halloween is tomorrow, so this week people in the news were trying on costumes and masks, deciding who they want to be. In sports, the St. Louis Cardinals were the ultimate Cinderella, going from 10.5 games behind in late August to World Series champs. In the GOP race, Rick Perry couldn\u0027t make up his mind. At first he decided to go retro, donning a Steve Forbes-inspired look as Flat Tax Man. But I guess that wasn\u0027t scary enough, so he switched to a more modern -- and much creepier -- mask: Birther Guy. Meanwhile, the Oakland police department apparently has decided to come as Richard Daley\u0027s 1968 Chicago police force, with injured Iraq war vet Scott Olsen left looking like the civil rights protesters bloodied on Selma\u0027s Edmund Pettus Bridge. Lastly, what\u0027s the over/under on how many \"Sodomized Gaddafi\" outfits we\u0027ll see tomorrow night? Boo!Read Post | CommentsDan Kloeffler, 10/28/11Digital Correspondent, ABC NewsSo why did I come out on television?

Governor Rick Perry was telling us how simple it would be to fill out a tax form for those who bought into his plan. And to illustrate his point he pulled out what looked to be a blank 5\"x7\" card.Read Post | Comments (318)Arianna Huffington, 10/24/11Just as solutions to the problems facing Europe and America are not going to be found in traditional political ways, the truth of what\u0027s happening is not going to be found in traditional media coverage either.

READ MORERead Post | Comments (428)Van Jones and Jakada Imani, 10/26/11This kind of crackdown we\u0027re seeing in Oakland is bad for our democracy, and it\u0027s bad for public safety.
