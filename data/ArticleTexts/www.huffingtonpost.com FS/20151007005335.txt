{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Democracy 21In 2007, with the additions of Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito to the Supreme Court, a new 5 to 4 majority emerged on the Court extremely hostile to campaign finance laws. This led to the Citizens United decision and the McCutcheon decision, which together have blown a massive hole in the campaign finance laws big enough for an army to drive through. Citizens United overturned a century of national policy and decades of Supreme Court decisions to hold that corporations could make expenditures in elections as long as they were made independent of the candidates being supported. In other words, today, donors can give and candidates can receive legalized bribes.Jeb Bush\u0027s recent use of \"stuff happens\" perfectly encapsulates the attitude about gun violence that is now prevalent in the Republican Party. The fact that this \"stuff\" happens more in America than anywhere else in the developed world doesn\u0027t seem to change their mind that mass shootings are an inevitable act of nature.President, People For the American WayThis is the month when Latinos are officially celebrated for everything we have achieved and contributed to this country. Yet the celebration of Latino Heritage Month is bittersweet, because we remain the most underrepresented group in politics and government leadership.Eric Garcetti\u0027s Chief of StaffThere is an abundance of research pointing to the effectiveness of early treatment of mental illness in reducing developmental delays and the health damaging complications of these disorders during these critical early years of a child\u0027s life.Public Health Editor, The Huffington Post; Former U.S. Assistant Surgeon GeneralParenting without the weight of the marital failure has been freeing. The feelings of a relationship ended are not neatly secured in a trash bag, disposed in a dump, never to be thought of again. Fragments remain. But they need no longer control us. And what is left is a deep, abiding love.Director of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel HillAssistant Director, Lineberger Cancer Center, UNCOne reason for our shamefully low turnout is America\u0027s ramshackle voter registration system. States have slowly improved the process over the last decade. But this year, a bold new reform has caught on -- automatic voter registration, starting at DMVs.President of the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of LawI look around and I know. None of this -- the municipal complex, the school across the street, the supermarket up the road -- is built for 100 years, especially not this hundred years. It won\u0027t last. And I can\u0027t imagine a better future version of this either.Columnist, Waging Nonviolence; author of \"It Runs in the Family: On Being Raised by Radicals and Growing into Rebellious Motherhood\"The Republican candidates have now entered a winnowing phase where voters are clearly indicating that there are only six viable candidates in the race. From an initial field of 17, two have dropped out, five are on life support (politically), and four are in stable but critical condition.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comWhile everyone -- including me -- loves to indulge on occasion, eating well at least 80 percent of the time is the key to staying healthy. And surrounding ourselves with nutritious foods certainly helps us to make healthy food choices. Here are nine healthy foods I try stock in my kitchen regularly.Internationally-recognized nutritionist; International Speaker; Adjunct professor of nutrition at NYU; Author, \u0027The Portion Teller Plan\u0027Protesters warned about the problems the Pacific Rim trade deal could bring to people around the world. Whether it\u0027s jobs being shipped overseas and wages being driven down in the U.S., medicine prices going through the roof, more pollution or unsafe food and products heading to our shores as a result of this bad trade deal, that wasn\u0027t enough to sway TPP negotiators.General President, International Brotherhood of TeamstersThe weight of everything that\u0027s wrong in the world shouldn\u0027t fall on the generation that didn\u0027t screw things up in the first place. Millennials aren\u0027t dumb, and we\u0027d love to show you how to build social media platforms and crowd-fund world-changing start-ups once we finish taking this selfie.Recent Graduate, Colby CollegeOnce again this year many schools will pause to commemorate Christopher Columbus. Given everything we know about who Columbus was and what he launched in the Americas, this needs to stop.Co-director, Zinn Education Project; Curriculum editor, Rethinking SchoolsUnlike those who\u0027ve taken to social media to express their disgust over Cosmopolitan Magazine\u0027s crowing of the Kardashians as \"America\u0027s First Family,\" I\u0027ve failed to understand the big to-do about the headline on the cover of their November issue. Love or hate them, the Kardashians embody what our country has come to represent to the rest of the world; vanity and excess.Radio host, writer, producerIf I\u0027m judgmental of you, just because of how you breathe and who you are, that anger will consume me and I can\u0027t be myself. When folk hate or reject LGBT people, it affects the person who is doing the hating.Executive Director, NETWORK, A National Catholic Social Justice LobbyGosar defended his outlandish statements by claiming to be a \"proud Catholic\" who attended a Midwestern Jesuit College. He cites his \"excellent education\" that provided an opportunity for him to \"think critically, to welcome debate and discussion and to be held accountable for [his] actions.\"Aspiring Multimedia Journalist/NBC Sports Game Logger/Emerson College GradInstead of giving refugees arriving in Germany a fair chance to settle, allowing them to make a respectable adjustment into work and education, more and more self-declared experts are taking the opportunity to point fingers.Political journalist, HuffPost GermanyI greet claims that the TPP will boost American growth and jobs with a healthy dose of skepticism. We already trade pretty freely with most of these countries, and tariffs are low enough already that taking them down further will yield marginal, non-measurable gains. So if it\u0027s not about growth and jobs, what is it about?Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThe Berenstain Bears volumes are mild jeremiads meant to protect our little ones from the potholes of early development and it\u0027s surprising there isn\u0027t The Berenstain Bears Stick Their Finger in a Wall Socket or The Berenstain Bears Stick Their Knife in the Toaster.WriterAt the height of the Cultural Revolution, Project 523 -- a covert operation launched by the Chinese government and headed by a young Chinese medical researcher by the name of Tu Youyou -- discovered what has been the most powerful and effective anti-malarial drug therapy to date.Independent source of news and analysis, from the academic and research community.When I first saw Demi Lovato\u0027s Vanity Fair cover this weekend, I applauded her. As a woman who has battled body confidence issues for most of her life and has spoken extensively about her eating disorder, Lovato has finally made peace with her appearance, celebrating with a naked, un-retouched photoshoot.Senior Lifestyle Editor of The Huffington Post UKUltimately, this is a decision that Joe Biden has to make. And, by all accounts, it is a hell of an emotional one. I feel for him. There\u0027s always a chance that Biden could run, and win. But the chances are, frankly, slim.Public Relations Consultant, www.winningprogressive.comIt took a coordinated response from the Department of Health and Human Services and partners around the government to fight this epidemic. Those efforts have made us better prepared than we were a year ago.Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, US Department of Health and Human ServicesNow is the time to elevate engineering as key to innovation. While we can\u0027t all be Sally Ride or John Glenn, we can learn enough about engineering to thrive in our complex technological world. Let\u0027s make the Orion spacecraft, designed to take humans into deep space, a real first step toward Mars.President, Museum of Science, Boston; former NASA Advisory Council member; Center for Advancement of Science in Space Board member; engineerIn a rational world, the real needs of the mentally ill would be identified and addressed in an efficient and cost effective way. Those who need care would receive it. Unfortunately, policy in the United States is based mostly on profit, political power, and ideology -- thus producing terrible outcomes that are anything but rational.Professor Emeritus, Duke UniversityPresident Bush is most responsible for the ISIS deluge. The Obama administration has played a malign, but secondary, role. Like its predecessor, it also intervened too much rather than too little. For instance, President Obama continued to back Iraq\u0027s Maliki government despite the latter\u0027s sectarian excesses.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteThe number of Russians now living below the poverty line is increasing in tandem with the number of Russian air strikes in Syria. Moscow is financing its military buildup and operations through cuts to the already woefully underfunded sectors of education, health care and infrastructure.Russian State Duma deputy from 1993 to 2007; political analystLast week, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump released his plan for changing the tax code. Many of the reports on the plan commented on the growth assumption and pointed out that few, if any, economists took it seriously. As a practical matter, we have seen this story before.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Alcoholism is an actual disease, not a joke. Pay attention to what you are saying. You never know the truth behind someone\u0027s drinking habits.H\u0026M has fallen behind schedule on securing life-saving safety upgrades in their Bangladeshi supplier factories. Such delays are risky for a company that saw 21 workers killed in a fire at their supplier, Garib \u0026 Garib, in 2010. H\u0026M is the largest buyer in Bangladesh, and with great power comes great responsibility.Executive Director, International Labor Rights ForumIn the aftermath of the gun massacre in Roseburg, the chorus of gun zealots already can be heard sounding the same cynical refrain they always chant -- more guns save lives and gun-free zones kill people. However, the tragedy\u0027s lasting lament is even louder -- guns don\u0027t belong in the classroom.Bilingual journalist and photographerIf I could sum up the era of my life in which I was discovering my sexuality in one word, that word would be: shame. Despite the personal nature of this story, I feel compelled to share it, because I fully believe that no young woman should have to experience such intense shame -- yet the sad truth is, most do.Writer, musician, lover of life.Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
