{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOLipstick on pigs, sex ed for pre-K, earmarks gone wild -- this presidential campaign is descending to a bridge to nowhere. We cannot let that happen again. This country is up against it: The worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, Gilded Age inequality, Iraq and Afghanistan, catastrophic climate change, the lawless presidency and more.

And every week it throws it away. It seems almost essential that these creative, funny people step up to make people think.Read Post | Comments (51)BIOArianna Huffington, 09.15.2008Sarah Palin may not have known what the Bush Doctrine was, but we\u0027re getting a pretty good idea of what the Palin Doctrine is. And what is it going to look like? Let\u0027s just say, it\u0027s going to seem familiar.Read Post | Comments (1029)BIORobert Creamer, 09.16.2008The American mortgage market now provides us with another clear example of how the fundamental premise of right-wing economic thought is dead wrong.Read Post | Comments (168)BIOJohn Cusack, 09.15.2008Not just more of the same -- worse than the same.
