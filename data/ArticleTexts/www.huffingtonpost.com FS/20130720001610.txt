{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Ahmed Shihab-EldinEmmy-Nominated Producer/Host, @HuffPostLiveThe U.S. can continue to portray itself as not taking sides in Egypt\u0027s political turmoil. American diplomats can continue to speak about Egypt\u0027s \"second chance\" at democracy, confirming that despite calls for inclusivity, America, like Saudi Arabia, was happy to turn the page on the Brotherhood. But instead of wavering and teetering, America should recognize and leverage its influence with Egypt\u0027s military to begin pushing for more transparency and accountability, especially in regards to its brutality and dominance in Egypt\u0027s political roadmap and its economy. The U.S. government has called for \"a transparent political process that is inclusive of all parties and groups,\" but continues to support the same organization that has refused to place a single member of any Islamist parties in any of the 30 key cabinet positions.Comments (22)Camille SeamanPhotographerThe underlying goal of my work is to help trigger an emotional connection, one that I hope will spark a relationship between the viewer and this planet.Comments (60)Bob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowWhat we\u0027re hearing from mostly white purists on the left is that the first African American president is a thuggish crook who should be in prison (or worse), and this faction is willing to align with a white conservative politician with a shaky racial record in order to achieve its prosecutorial goal.CommentsCarl JeffersTelevision political commentator, radio talk show host, lecturer, political analystIf President Obama leaves office without being more assertive in using his bully pulpit to try to engage the country in a more permanent and comprehensive understanding of the issues of race, then I believe historians and history will look back on his administration and assert that he missed a great opportunity.Comments (153)Stan GreenbergCEO, Greenberg Quinlan Rosner; Pollster; Co-head, Democracy Corps; Carville-Greenberg MemoWe would all benefit from listening to the voters who may be trying to tell us something about what is happening in Washington and the U.S. Congress. Maybe there is a price to pay for not trying to help our country meet its challenges.Comments (15)Gary HartPresident, Hart International, Ltd.For those who viscerally hate the Russians, there will always be reasons, however obscure, to justify their resentment.

I believed my dreams were 20 lbs. away from me, and what seemed like a forced, new ideal of beauty on a billboard didn\u0027t seem to change that.Comments (84)Joe PeyronninHofstra Journalism ProfessorWhen future historians write about America\u0027s long struggle for racial equality, they will include the moment when the country\u0027s first African-American president broke his silence about the 2012 death of young Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida.CommentsDavid ViennaScreenwriter, playwright and author of TheDaddyComplex.comYes, using the CTFD method, you\u0027ll find the pressure lifted and realize your child loves you no matter what, even if they\u0027ve yet to master the alphabet.
