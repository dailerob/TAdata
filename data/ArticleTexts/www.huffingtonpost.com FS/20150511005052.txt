{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The nation is far more unequal than in 1990 -- and the economic inequality translates into a political tilt. As wealth becomes more concentrated, so does power. A far-right Supreme Court has compounded the damage by literally defining money as speech and corporations as natural persons. On the other hand, the past 25 years have produced stunning gains for the politics of inclusion. Despite continuing police brutality and persistent glass ceilings, this is a more accepting nation than it was a quarter century ago. We have more women and black CEOs, far more women and non-white professionals, an African American in the White House, who will very likely be succeeded by a woman. Same-sex marriage, once ridiculed, is increasingly seen as normal. All of these gains were the fruits of popular struggle, which has to give one some hope that inequality is at last breaking through as a top-tier political issue.I don\u0027t believe this happened for a reason, but it has given us all a reason to be more present parents, more loving spouses, more supportive friends, and more caring leaders. The overwhelming sentiment from everyone who knew Dave is that he inspired us to be better human beings.Wharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027Mother\u0027s Day is about thanking moms for everything they do for their children. But I\u0027m also thankful for everything Democrats do for moms. As a society, we must be committed to empowering moms to make those tough decisions and to create opportunities for them to succeed.Author, \u0027For the Next Generation\u0027; Chair, Democratic National CommitteeThe AVPE effort is not a substitute for Palestinian independence -- since it recognizes that only with independence can the full potential of the Palestinian economy be realized. At the same time, however, AVPE knows that creating jobs, finding markets and growing the private sector can\u0027t be set aside for another 20 years.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027I don\u0027t know enough to understand what that must be like for a parent or what it means to be a parent, for that matter. But I do know what it\u0027s like to be loved, because my mother showed me what that meant, even when she should have been out of love herself.Comedian, Host, ‘Chelsea Lately’American observers of UK politics would do well to see the U.S. parallels here. The dilemma facing the UK Labour Party is basically the one faced by Democratic presidential candidates as they seek victory in 2016. If either major UK political party fails to find its way, the US stands poised to lose its most reliable European ally.Worrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsIt might surprise you to learn that every year there are 1.5 million women living with HIV giving birth around the world. While every mom is different, we all share one thing: We want our babies to be given the healthy start in life they deserve.Actress, activist and motherWith Matalin interviewing Nader in a surprising love-fest, we air our 200th show. Mary and Ron Reagan ask: a) is Geller a Paul Revere or arsonist hiding behind the 1st Amendment? b) will \"ISIS is Here!\" become the rallying cry of the Right? Then: Oh God, it\u0027s Huckabee!Host, \u0027Both Sides Now\u0027Even if predatory for-profit college companies can hang on for a period, restoring revenues while retaining their abusive practices, the era where they blatantly and arrogantly rip off and students and taxpayers, while Washington politicians and lobbyists do their bidding without apparent shame, is likely near its end.Attorney, advocate, writer at RepublicReport.orgLike Israel\u0027s recent wars in Gaza and Lebanon, Saudi Arabia\u0027s campaign is being widely judged a failure in a military sense. Like Israel in Gaza, Saudi Arabia pretended that warning civilians to flee an area that they intend to bomb absolves them from their obligation under international humanitarian law to avoid civilian casualties.Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicyAs a mother, I felt optimistic 15 years ago that we could stop the horror of burying our children before their time. Yet today it\u0027s easy to despair that nothing will change as few in my legislature even bother to stand up to debate for those who are slaughtered by guns. I cannot accept this.Missouri State RepresentativeScience today has the power to inspire just as much as it always has, and today it is more important than ever that the scientific community capitalize on every opportunity it gets to re-engage, and to take on \"the war on science,\" if that is indeed what we have come to.CERN Director General\"Held captive.\" It was how one 13-year-old described the feeling of growing up poor in our wealthy nation, and for more and more Americans living in poverty, this feeling isn\u0027t just a metaphor.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe study of inequality has been going on forever. To give you an idea, the index used to measure how unequal the distribution of income is -- the \"Gini Coefficient\" -- was invented a century ago. So, why the sudden interest? Why worry now about something that has been the fodder of academics, politicians, and the media for so long?Senior Director of the World Bank\u0027s Global Practice for Macroeconomics and Fiscal Management - Author of \"Economic Development: What Everyone Needs To Know\".We talk a lot about the dangers of poor sleep, the risks to health, mental and physical well being and performance, and to quality of life. One serious consequence of poor sleep that sometimes gets overlooked? The risk it poses to accidental death.Clinical Psychologist; Board Certified Sleep SpecialistIf fast track passes, TPP\u0027s passage is inevitable. The voting environment will be similar to what happened with the \"Citigroup budget\" vote, when the pressure was on members to pass it with provisions that deregulated derivatives or shut down the whole government.Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureToday on Mother\u0027s Day, we need to confront the truth that the United States doesn\u0027t do that well by mothers and consequently by children. It isn\u0027t simply that the PDA isn\u0027t as strong as it should be; mothers face many obstacles in the American workplace from pregnancy to childbirth and beyond.President, American Constitution Society for Law and PolicyIf, Senator Cruz, you believe that the United States military is a political tool of its civilian leadership, you have reached a conclusion unsupported by fact, history and good sense. Even a Princeton and Harvard Law man should know the difference. Also, it makes you the rudest Canadian we\u0027ve ever run across.Democratic consultant and writerWhen someone says they want to \"boost their metabolism,\" what they usually mean is that they want to burn more calories as part of an effort to lose weight. That line of thinking isn\u0027t entirely wrong, but your metabolism actually does a lot more than just burn calories.www.theactivetimes.comThe trade deals negotiated by the last three presidents have lowered U.S. wages, lost jobs and generated a chronic trade deficit. President Obama\u0027s main argument that exports have risen, without mentioning that imports have risen much faster, is now transparently deceitful to anyone who can add and subtract.Jeff Faux, author of The Servant EconomyThe problem with the conservative -- and one reason libertarians should see them as opponents of individual rights and liberty -- is they are incapable of understanding that rights are a two-way street. Conservatives consistently demand rights for themselves, which they then want to deny to others.President, Moorfield Storey InstituteToday, deep into my routine as a single mom of two teenage daughters and an elementary-school-age son, hearing those criticisms has yet to become any easier. I somehow suspect it never will. So I continue to remind my kids (and myself) I\u0027m not infallible. I\u0027m human.Senior Editor, DivorcedMoms.comIn the days since the earthquake, through salty tears and a jolt that has nothing to do with an earthquake, I have realized the depth of my attachment to Nepal. Embarking on my global adventures, I failed to realize until now, how large a part of my heart I had left at home.Chief Executive, WaterAid AmericaThe TPP and other trade agreements create an economic race to the bottom, creating a nation of Walmart shoppers rather than family wage jobs and an economically and environmentally sustainable future.Co-Director, Center for Policy AnalysisSure, safe and easy might feel nice. But new and exciting feels amazing. If you\u0027re meant to be, you\u0027ll be. Trust me.Columnist and author of \u0027Open: Love, Sex, and Life in an Open Marriage\u0027 and \u0027O Wow! Discovering Your Ultimate Orgasm\u0027There are moments in life when we know we need to drastically shift the course of our lives in order to live a life we love and truly be happy. Moments that while sometimes scary, will lead to a change that allows us to grow, evolve, and finally become who we were meant to be. Here are seven sure-fire signs you are ready and open for the big changes ahead.Life Coach, Writer, Connector \u0026 lover of life, helping women around the globe live the life of their dreams.I\u0027ve worn glasses for almost 50 years and I still don\u0027t like wearing my thick lenses in public. At midlife I should be over this already. I mean, I\u0027ve made peace with so many things by now that I think it\u0027s time to put this behind me.Award-winning blogger at \"An Empowered Spirit\"Food hysteria demonizes the pleasure we should all derive from eating good food. Real food is to be enjoyed and shared. If you want to be scared, worry more about food scarcity as we disregard our planet. Otherwise, enjoy your meal.Author, \u0027Getting Things Off My Chest: A Survivor’s Guide to Staying Fearless and Fabulous in the Face of Breast Cancer\u0027I\u0027m going to let you in on a big secret: You are beautiful today. It\u0027s taken me 39.10 years to figure this out, but now that I have, I have to share. Here\u0027s how I figured it out.Caurie Putnam is a mother, columnist with the Democrat and Chronicle and freelance reporter with Reuters. She lives in the Rochester, NY area. @CauriePutnamThree years ago this month, as I ordered an espresso in a small café in Rome, I made the decision to sell 90 percent of my earthly possessions in exchange for a life in Italy. It was a decision that has brought me joy, freedom and adventure; but it came at the price of living very small.Co-founder of Better Way to ItalyBefore tying the knot in 2008, my wife, Kim, and I never discussed money. But I had financial skeletons in my closet. With $18,000 in student loans and another $18,000 from an auto loan, I brought a significant amount of debt into our marriage.LearnVest is a program for your money.Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"JEB: I\u0027D HAVE INVADED IRAQ TOO!",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
