Furman Professor of Law, Harvard Law School.It is way too early, and perhaps even a bit crazy, to see an American Spring in the growing protests on Wall Street. Yet. But there is no doubt that if there is one place in America that these protests should begin, it is there, and it is now.Read Post | Comments (499)Jason Linkins, 10/5/11Editor, Eat the PressOver at Salon, Alex Pareene writes about the struggle that the media is having discerning the \"demands\" of the Occupy Wall Street movement even though it\u0027s easy to discern the larger concerns of the 99% if you just start paying attention.Read Post | Comments (202)Candy Spelling, 10/5/11AuthorIt\u0027s no surprise that the Hero Dog Awards received over 450 nominations representing every state in the country. The eight finalists from the various fields of canine service included law enforcement, search and rescue, guide dogs, the military and therapy dogs.Read Post | CommentsEmma Ruby-Sachs, 10/5/11AttorneyIt\u0027s not enough to study Occupy Wall St. as an American anomaly with a surprising lack of cohesion and a fascinating list of diverse demands. It can\u0027t be splintered off or explained away. This is the next phase of a global push for real democracy.Read Post | Comments (71)Robert Reich, 10/5/11Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Aftershock\u0027If Greece goes down, investors will flee Ireland, Spain, Italy, and Portugal. All of this sends big French and German banks reeling. If one of these banks collapses, or show signs of major strain, Wall Street is in big trouble.Read Post | Comments (164)Rep. Charles Rangel, 10/5/11Representative from the 15th Congressional District in New YorkI visited Liberty Plaza this past Saturday to meet the 99 percent of Americans who are bearing the brunt of the recession. I am very proud to see that they have started to mobilize and speak up.Read Post | CommentsErica Heller, 10/5/11Author, essayistJoseph Heller\u0027s crowd was not, shall we say, exactly Gertrude Stein\u0027s Parisian Salon. Dad\u0027s evenings of recreation and creative amusement ended more as Midnight at the Rickshaw Garage than Midnight in Paris.Read Post | CommentsMatthew Dowd, 10/5/11Political StrategistSometimes it\u0027s tough to find the frequency of this 2012 race. The traditional way we measure what\u0027s important in a campaign no longer really applies.Read Post | CommentsJane Chafin, 10/5/11Director, Offramp Gallery, Pasadena, CAIf you follow the instructions on the screen of this first video, you will experience a brief and very real visual hallucination at the end.Read Post | CommentsDylan Ratigan, 10/5/11Host, MSNBC\u0027s \u0027The Dylan Ratigan Show\u0027; Author, soon to be released \u0027Greedy Bastards\u0027One hundred thousand of us have decided to get money out of politics once and for all. This is a monumental task that we can only achieve with a single shared long-term goal: To force debate and passage of a Constitutional amendment to ban all private money in politics.Read Post | Comments (53)Edward James Olmos, 10/5/11ActorWhile progress has been made and restoration has most certainly begun in the gulf since the BP gusher last year, its clear from a new report that there is a great deal of work to be done.Read Post | CommentsStacia L. Brown, 10/5/11Writer, mother, adjunct professor, and contributor to PostBourgie.com.As of last night Michael B. Jordan ended his riveting, sympathetic arc on NBC\u0027s Parenthood. Now that he\u0027s gone, I can talk about him -- and the way his interracial dating arc was handled.Read Post | CommentsLee Woodruff, 10/5/11WriterAs I gaze at what our future together means, growing old, an empty nest, frailties and potential diagnoses; my mind\u0027s eye views life a bit differently on this side of 50.Read Post | Comments (16)David Paul, 10/5/11President, Fiscal Strategies GroupA decade of borrowing and greed finally culminated in the collapse of Wall Street, and it has taken three years for any visible protests to bubble to the surface.Read Post | CommentsVicky Ward, 10/5/11Contributing editor, Vanity FairIf you want to be really polite, don\u0027t be digital. This might sound like heresy -- but it\u0027s true. When you interact with someone one-on-one, the last thing they want to see is your cell phone, tablet or computer.Read Post | Comments (12)Raymond J. Learsy, 10/5/11Author, \u0027Oil and Finance: The Epic Corruption\u0027In covering the Wall Street protests for CNN, Erin Burnett made her assumption that the demonstrators didn\u0027t really know what they were talking about crystal clear.Read Post | Comments (259)Neil Barofsky, 10/5/11Former Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP)When I stepped down as the Special Inspector General for TARP at the end of March, I warned that HAMP was falling far short of its stated goals and even further short of meeting the urgent needs of American homeowners. Unfortunately, there has been little improvement since then.Read Post | Comments (80)Nathan O. Hatch, 10/5/11President, Wake Forest UniversityA college\u0027s ultimate responsibility is to help students clarify their sense of self. We do them a disservice if we ignore their future working life as they discover their talents, passions and convictions.Read Post | CommentsAbraham H. Foxman, 10/5/11National Director of the Anti-Defamation LeagueFor those of us who have placed great hopes in your leadership to transform the path of the Palestinians, your words and actions, culminating in your speech to the United Nations, have been disillusioning.Read Post | CommentsPooja R. Mottl, 10/5/11Certified in Whole Foods \u0026 Fitness, Food Origins SleuthChocolate, in small amounts, can be good for you. But how do you know you\u0027re really eating pure chocolate? Could you in fact be consuming an adulterated knockoff?Read Post | Comments (28)G. Roger Denson, 10/5/11Cultural critic and essayist published with Parkett and Art in America.When I walked away from two shows comprised of women artists confronting their worst fears about themselves as women, and a third show by a man attempting to humanize the face of 19th-century \"female hysteria,\" I couldn\u0027t shake from my head \"Is That All There Is?\"Read Post | CommentsWill Bunch, 10/5/11Author, \u0027The Backlash\u0027They are The Other 99 Percent who\u0027ve been stripped bare of any real influence in a supposed democracy where both parties compete for the cash of the 1 Percenters, and so taking back their country starts with the simplest of steps -- re-occupying America, physically.Read Post | Comments (97)Rev. Malcolm Boyd, 10/5/11Writer-in-residence, Episcopal diocese of LASince no one is an island, quit acting like one. Reach out for help, ask for it, and humbly admit your need. And when you perceive need in someone else, offer help without feeling superior.Read Post | CommentsJD Samson, 10/5/11Musician, DJ and one third of Le TigreI\u0027m trying to keep up with artists who have had a similar amount of success as I have had, trying my hardest to appear to be making the same amount of money as they are.

This is my coming out.Read Post | Comments (24)Jason McCabe Calacanis, 10/5/11CEO, Mahalo and ThisWeekInIt\u0027s lame to protest for more jobs when you will so easily create them by starting a company. Now get out of your tents, learn to code and make something that changes the world.Read Post | CommentsKaren Talavera, 2011.10.06Deborah Divine, 2011.10.05Syed Yahya Hussainy, 2011.10.05Ryan Kaminski, 2011.10.05Fahad Faruqui, 2011.10.05Jane Chafin, 2011.10.05Dr. Reese Halter, 2011.10.05Rabbi Abraham Cooper, 2011.10.05Matthew Dowd, 2011.10.05Edward J.
