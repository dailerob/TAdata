{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027If Trump is the nominee, the establishment Republicans will very likely mount a third party campaign. Conversely, if Trump has the most delegates and he is denied nomination, he will very likely run as an independent. So expect a three-way race, one way or the other. And if either third party candidate wins some states and none gets an Electoral College majority, under the Constitution the election would be thrown into the (Republican) House to pick the next president. That would probably be House Speaker Paul Ryan. This is a revolutionary year, but revolutions fail more often than they succeed. Wouldn\u0027t it be the height of irony if after all the politicized anger at the shafting of working people -- represented by Sanders on the left and (weirdly) by Trump on the right -- the financial and political establishment managed to keep the lid on, with one of the most conventional rightwing and pro-corporate figures in American politics, Paul Ryan?Although there are liberals who are disappointed that President Obama did not nominate someone more in the spirit of a William Brennan or a Thurgood Marshall, Merrick Garland is an exceptional choice. But Senate Republicans, led by the likes of Mitch McConnell and Charles Grassley, refuse even to consider his nomination.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoFears of being crushed by debt or of falling off the economic ladder are pressuring students to conform, and we must find ways to counteract these pressures or we risk undermining our scientific productivity as well as our broad cultural creativity.President, Wesleyan UniversityAmerica needs a crash course in civics. More importantly, we need to ingrain an understanding about the rights and responsibilities of citizens into our collective experience.President, American Federation of TeachersOn Monday, President Obama will visit Cuba - the first time a U.S. president has traveled there since Calvin Coolidge. It\u0027s an important step toward normalizing relations between the two countries, opening up important economic possibilities for Cuba and the potential for U.S. investment and influence there.Senior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstA book worth revisiting in light of the Trump phenomenon is Sinclair Lewis\u0027s It Can\u0027t Happen Here, published in 1935. It demonstrates the fragility of our nation\u0027s democracy by having a folksy New Englander gain the White House with vague blandishments, and then usher in a dictatorial regime of suppression, terror and totalitarianism to save the nation from welfare cheats, promiscuity, crime and a liberal press.Former SEC CommissionerStuart Stevens illuminates his anti-Trump insights on social media while Ron reminds us about the last contested convention in \u002776. What should GOP elites do now that they can\u0027t live with or without Trump? Also: Will McConnell\u0027s SCOTUS-Senate sit-down strike sink \"the party of hell no!\"?Host, \u0027Both Sides Now\u0027Obama\u0027s critics have argued that the trip is coming too early in the normalization process, that not enough has been achieved to justify a presidential visit. But for Obama\u0027s purposes, the trip is well timed. By going now, he gives his administration ten months to work on turning the momentum of the presidential visit into concrete agreements.Professor at American University in Washington, D.C.Trump\u0027s aim is not to get any substantial support from blacks, since that\u0027s an impossibility, but to sow seeds of doubt, confusion and even a little hostility toward Clinton among just enough blacks to keep them from the polls in the must-win, battleground states.Author and political analystWe know Trump can bring home the bacon -- we\u0027ve heard it a thousand times. He\u0027s made millions and millions of dollars, etc., but is he the true conservative? Or does that mantle belong to Texas\u0027 Ted Cruz, who not only brings home the bacon, but also cooks it for his family on the weekends after church -- using a machine gun.Civil rights lawyer; former state senator, writerIn just a few days, President Obama will head to Havana, Cuba, becoming the first sitting president to do so in nearly 90 years. It\u0027s an historic trip?--?one that gives the President and First Lady a chance to meet with the Cuban government and hear directly from the Cuban people.Assistant to the President and Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications and SpeechwritingSerious people are now using the \"f word\" - fascist - to describe the Donald Trump phenomenon.Author/Professor, Miami University, Oxford, OhioThe process to elect a president is labyrinthine and dreadfully confusing. But must it be? Can we simplify this great quadrennial civic exercise? Make it more straightforward and citizen-friendly? I believe it\u0027s possible to do so -- before 2020.TeacherWhen the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) comes to town this week for their annual policy conference, high on the agenda of issues they\u0027ll be pushing Congress to support are bills designed to \"fight the boycott of Israel.\"President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027The U.S. House of Representatives\u0027 recent resolution urging for the creation of a temporary UN criminal tribunal for Syria is a worrisome departure from American leadership in the field. For a number of reasons, this resolution and underlying strategy is ill-advised and does little to increase the chance that justice will come to the victims of atrocities in Syria.International Criminal Lawyer and Advocate, Washington, DCUnlike black American tourists, President Obama will be entering Cuba as a head of state. Hopefully, rather than using Cuba as photo opportunity or chance to impose U.S. politics on the island, President Obama will see what Afro-Cubans know all-too wellAssistant Professor of History and African American Studies at LSU.
