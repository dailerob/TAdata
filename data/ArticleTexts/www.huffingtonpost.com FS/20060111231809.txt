READ MOREREAD POST | comments01.11.2006 Jeralyn MerrittBloggers and liberal organizations are much harsher in than the MSM in their analysis of Alito\u0027s performance yesterday. Digby calls Alito a \"freeper.\" Armando at Daily Kos calls Alito Say Anything Sammy, while Jane at Firedoglake calls him Strip-Search Sammy.READ POST | comments (11)01.11.2006 David SirotaIf you want to know why many people believe the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC) severely hobbles the Democratic Party and gives cover to the worst right-wing stereotypes, just take a look at a guy they employ named Marshall Wittman.READ POST | comments (25)01.11.2006 Micah SifryWhen will one of those charitable organizations who are now being showered with campaign contributions from Abramoff and his clients tell their would-be benefactors, \"we don\u0027t want your dirty money\"?READ POST | comments01.11.2006 Trey EllisPerhaps the Europeans, have stood by to just watch us sink into this quagmire because they are tired of being pushed around.

If they did, they might understand why so many people hate us.READ POST | comments01.11.2006 Bob BurnettThe Religious Right has restricted their focus to abortion, gay marriage, and judicial activism. In so doing, they have ignored the fundamental teachings of Jesus. They have forgotten about justice.READ POST | comments (15)01.11.2006 Cenk UygurThis isn\u0027t your garden variety every day Supreme Court confirmation hearings.

The New York Times business model is selling readers a bundle of hard and soft news and advertising (people do like to browse the ads). For MSNBC, the model is selling Chris Matthews.READ POST | comments01.11.2006 Andrei ChernyJefferson put forward a radically democratic vision that fit the times. He said, the purpose of government was \"to secure the greatest degree of happiness possible to the general mass of those associated under it.\"READ POST | comments (16)01.11.2006 Robert ScheerWhat irony that those once young Republicans, who hectored their elders about being more vigilant in defending the nation\u0027s taxpayers and security forces, should now end up accused of deeply betraying both.READ POST | comments (20)01.11.2006 Jim LoganIf nothing else, proponents of Intelligent Design are tenacious.
