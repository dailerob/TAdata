{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Next time out, why not have a debate designed to resemble the decision-making process a president would actually go through in office? For starters, the candidates could have access to all the notes and information they want. It\u0027s fun to see how a candidate responds to a zinger, but it\u0027d be much more instructive to see how a candidate goes about seeking information that he doesn\u0027t know. Indeed, very few crises in our history have come about because a president wanted to consider too much outside information. So let’s give them web access, too. We could even have candidates bring their advisors on stage with them. The moderator could throw out a difficult hypothetical; the candidates would consult their respective advisors and come back with an answer. That is, after all, how the presidency actually works.Read Post | Comments (177)Marlo Thomas, 10/16/12Award-winning actress, author, and activistDo you want to know how to lose ten pounds in a hurry?
