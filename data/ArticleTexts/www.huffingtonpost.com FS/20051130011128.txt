{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AP/J. Scott ApplewhiteAs I read Frank Rich\u0027s latest takedown of the administration\u0027s cover up of \"wrongdoing in the executive branch between 9/11 and shock and awe,\" I thought of Bob Woodward. During this time, Woodward was writing two books on the administration and enjoyed unparalleled access to the president, Dick Cheney, and Scooter Libby. So how come Woodward, supposedly the preeminent investigative reporter of our time, missed the biggest story of our time -- a story that was taking place right under his nose? Some would say it\u0027s because he\u0027s carrying water for the Bushies. I disagree. I think it\u0027s because he\u0027s the dumb blonde of American journalism, so awed by his proximity to power that he buys whatever he\u0027s being sold.READ POST | comments (118)11.29.2005 Marty KaplanWhat’s a good patriotic right-winger to do: support the right of Comcast and Viacom to require you to let homos in your house, or support the good folks at the No Nipple Coalition...READ POST | comments (42)11.29.2005 David ReesThank God the Iraq war has been such a BLOODY, MISMANAGED DISASTER, because we now know for sure that Saddamists and fundamentalists are capable of forming alliances!
