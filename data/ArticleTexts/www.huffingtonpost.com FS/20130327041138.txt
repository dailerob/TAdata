{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonIn the 1840s, Benjamin Disraeli, still a long way from being prime minister, wanted to wake people up to the plight of the British working class. The alarm he sounded wasn\u0027t delivered in a speech, a pamphlet, or an article -- but in a novel, Sybil, published in 1845. Ever since I read Sybil when I was at Cambridge, I\u0027ve loved thinkers and writers who use storytelling to reach people and get us to act. And so it was that I found myself moderating a panel discussion last week with the director and two cast members of a movie that uses storytelling to wake us up to one of the biggest problems of our modern age: the effect that being \"connected\" to technology 24/7 is having on our ability to connect with our lives, ourselves, and the people we love. Like so many people, this is something I struggle with on a regular basis. That\u0027s why Disconnect struck a nerve.Comments (14)Jacob CombsEditor, EqualityOnTrial.comI just walked out of oral arguments at the U.S. Supreme Court. It was a whirlwind hearing, and all three lawyers faced tough questions from the justices. Here\u0027s my initial take on the justices\u0027 questions and what they might mean.Comments (192)Jonathan RauchGuest scholar, Brookings InstitutionListening to the Supreme Court\u0027s arguments on the big gay marriage case -- which will decide if California, or for that matter any other state, can forbid same-sex marriage, as California\u0027s Proposition 8 did in 2008 -- I was struck by the baldly political nature of the conversation.Comments (23)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistWhen I went on Phil Donahue\u0027s talk show in 1977, the handsome host knocked me for a loop. In the green room beforehand, he told me he wanted to talk to me about my mother (no one ever wanted to talk about my mother -- just my famous father), so I immediately knew there was something ... different about this guy.Comments (56)Jim WallisChristian leader for social changeWe need to establish a firm principle: the abuse of women by men will no longer be tolerated by other men. The voices of more men need to make that perfectly clear. For boys, for young athletes, and for fathers, Steubenville should become a wake-up call.Comments (188)Zack ExleyVenture AnachronistA bold, practical-and-radical politics is waiting to introduce itself to the American people. Once it does, millions of dollars in small donations, and an army of volunteers, then many respected establishment figures, think tanks, corporations and other organizations will join us.Comments (192)Kate FridkisBlogger, Eat The Damn CakeAnd yet I keep hearing that I\u0027m being selfish.Comments (158)Edward Jay EpsteinAuthor, \u0027The Annals of Unsolved Crime\u0027The absurdity in the Amanda Knox case is that the Italian prosecutors are now getting another chance to perpetuate their original miscarriage of justice.Comments (77)Carol J. CarterAuthor and student success expertPoverty is complex, but one tool that is known to crack the poverty cycle is an education. Although many low-income parents may want their child to go to college, they may not know how to get them there.Comments (28)Jackie Morgan MacDougallExecutive Editor, TheRickiLakeShow.comAfter years letting your marriage run on auto pilot, I wouldn\u0027t be so sure your spouse will be waiting with open arms.Comments (187)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorPutting a bunch more kids in Head Start is not what\u0027s being proposed here. The main proposal is a partnership with states to ensure that all four-year-old kids from moderate and low-income families have access to quality preschool.Comments (51)Elizabeth B. WydraChief Counsel, Constitutional Accountability CenterIt may have taken us 100 years to get it right with respect to race-restrictions on the freedom to marry, but it doesn\u0027t mean those laws weren\u0027t unconstitutional in 1868. The same is true, nearly 150 years after the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, for laws that deny gay and lesbian couples the freedom to marry.Comments (21)Lisa BelkinSenior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, The Huffington PostI would not have \u0027known them anywhere.\u0027 Forty years is a long time, and we, all four of us, are now blurred and softened versions of the ones who\u0027d spent nearly every day together long ago.Comments (34)Will BunchAuthor, \u0027Tear Down This Myth\u0027By any standard, the failure of the America media in 2002-03 was the worst collapse by any press corps anywhere since the 1930s. In a profession where the highest value is on truth telling, false information was presented as fact on front pages night after night.Comments (102)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027What people do in their bedrooms shouldn\u0027t be the public\u0027s business. Women should have rights over their own bodies. Same-sex couples should be allowed to marry. But what powerful people do in their boardrooms is the public\u0027s business.Comments (846)James MooreBest selling author, Director of Progress Texas PACEric Resnick did not want to ask the question. He felt an obligation, though, because other reporters were avoiding the subject. They ought to have long ago confronted Ken Mehlman about the contradictions between his politics and his personal life.Comments (14)Dahr JamailAuthor, \u0027Beyond the Green Zone: Dispatches from an Unembedded Journalist in Occupied IraqToday, not to put too fine a point on it, Iraq is a failed state, teetering on the brink of another sectarian bloodbath, and beset by chronic political deadlock and economic disaster. Its social fabric has been all but shredded.Comments (64)Elizabeth BirchPresident, Elizabeth Birch Company/Global OutIt is my hope that the court will find the courage to rule this year on a constitutional conclusion that is inevitable -- and not wait another 50 years for justice.CommentsAdam Amel RogersProject Specialist, USC Annenberg Norman Lear CenterAs a gay sports fan, I have a simple message for any athlete who is ready to come out: We got you. I hope you are listening, because the LGBT sports-loving community has been waiting for this for a long time and we are ready to battle for you.Comments (14)Mary RobinsonPresident, Mary Robinson Foundation - Climate Justice.A lack of gender equality is limiting our ability to achieve sustainable development, as we consistently underuse and undervalue the contribution of half of the population. Mothers know this.CommentsGregory T. AngeloExecutive Director Log Cabin RepublicansA Roberts ruling in favor of overturning the Defense of Marriage Act would be a victory for federalism, a triumph for the gay equal rights movement, and a historic moment for the Court that could well mark the moment that conservative opposition to same-sex marriage crumbled to dust.CommentsLisa CopelandDating CoachThe problem is when we want an alpha male, we are threatening the ingrained role in men\u0027s DNA from caveman days of needing to be the provider. An alpha male looks at Katie and doesn\u0027t know how to play the provider role of being able to give to Katie in a way that will make her happy.Comments (180)Ray ChambersPhilanthropist; Founder of the Amelior FoundationEnding death from diseases like malaria, AIDS, tuberculosis, pneumonia and diarrhea is now possible and can be accomplished at little cost. Can the global community work together to reach the goal of reducing child mortality?Comments (15)John BeckerLGBT activist, writer and bloggerOur opponents\u0027 hatred for my marriage will never be stronger than my love for my husband Michael. Their disgust and disdain for our families can never surpass the depth of our commitment to our spouses and children.Comments (11)Marissa IonnoStudent, Rutgers UniversityIt\u0027s amazing what clicking a \"share\" button can do. All my life I knew I was going to do animal rescue, but because of the success of my Facebook page, The TAILS Network, my path has been truly altered.CommentsMargaret ChoComedian, actor and recording artistDan needs some paradise right now. He is on trial for contesting and questioning Don\u0027t Ask Don\u0027t Tell, which was later repealed, yet now he has to go to court, and face some possibly harsh consequences, for speaking out against it years ago.Comments (214)Brittany GibbonsBlogger, \"Brittany, Herself\"I\u0027ve never lost friends or boyfriends or husbands over my scale. It also didn\u0027t hold me back from having an amazingly exciting career or chasing all the things I never imagined I could achieve.Comments (101)Paul HogarthManaging Editor, Beyond ChronDespite having strong political and religious feelings about the issue, how are opponents \"harmed\" by same-sex couples getting married -- and having their relationship recognized by the law?Comments (38)John PavleyCTO @ The Huffington Post, BloggerIn the real world, which increasingly is becoming the virtually augmented reality world, a smartphone, a pad, or a laptop are survival tools. Even the Amish have a word processor.Comments (75)Sandy WeinerChief Love Officer, Last First DateThe bottom line is that first impressions matter in dating. If you want a great relationship with someone special, you need to put your best self forward.Comments (579)Mark Brennan RosenbergAuthor, \u0027Blackouts and Breakdowns\u0027, \u0027Eating My Feelings\u0027There\u0027s no doubt that there is something genius about the formula that is the Real Housewives franchise. It\u0027s everything you\u0027ve ever wanted your life to be... but you just can\u0027t afford. There is a special place in my heart for the ladies of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.Comments (13)Gadadhara Pandit Dasa, 2013.27.03Christopher Rosen, 2013.26.03Jonathan Agin, 2013.26.03Liat Kornowski, 2013.26.03Dr. Steve Rosenberg, 2013.26.03Jonathan Lewis, 2013.26.03Maggie Fox, 2013.26.03Stephen Hren, 2013.26.03The Rev.
