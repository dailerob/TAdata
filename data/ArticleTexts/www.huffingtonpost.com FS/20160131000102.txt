{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior writer, BillMoyers.com. Former senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.Pity poor Washington. No doubt breaking the hearts of elected and appointed government officials, their staffs and hangers-on, the Open Secrets blog at the Center for Responsive Politics reports that the \"influence industry appears to be contracting, and the trend continued in 2015.\" But before you shed a single poignant tear, kindly note that the money spent on lobbying merely slipped from $3.24 billion in 2014 to $3.2 billion. That\u0027s still an awful lot of lettuce, more than enough to spread the corporate love around big time, cash on the barrelhead for votes, deregulation, tax breaks, insider information and other assorted favors. Nor is it even counting campaign contributions.Back in 2014, Dunham\u0027s memoir, Not That Kind of Girl, included a list of things that keep her up at night. Meanwhile, a realistic, yet not overly dramatized depiction of OCD gets a good amount of screen time on Girls in the form of Dunham\u0027s character. But is there such a thing as too revealing?Author, research psychologist and gender scholarA bunch of people seem to be saying that it doesn\u0027t matter for policy outcomes if Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton is elected President. The rough claim seems to be: Republicans are going to control the House anyway, if not the Senate, so a Democratic President won\u0027t be able to do anything anyway.Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicyIf and when Bernie Sanders is brought down by the very party he is championing, the millions of Bernie supporters, especially young voters, will have to consider breaking off into a new political party that will make American history.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorGrit is as rare as it is important. The good news is any of us can get grittier with a little extra focus and effort.Author of #1 bestselling book, Emotional Intelligence 2.0, and president of TalentSmart, world\u0027s leading provider of emotional intelligence.Food insecure children are more likely to be behind in social skills and reading performance in kindergarten. By elementary school they are four times more likely to need mental health counseling.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundHow candidates for high office speak about the Middle East should be a critical test of their capacity to lead our nation. I have listened attentively to all of the Republican and Democratic Party debates and have been deeply disturbed. I am most troubled by what I hear on the Republican side.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Advising women living in these countries to delay pregnancy is a whole other matter -- because for most of them, decisions related to family planning and their reproductive health are not in their control.Communications Director, Girls\u0027 GlobeI appreciate the new rhetoric from the many candidates saying that drug use and addiction are a health issue, not a criminal issue. But there\u0027s a huge disconnect between this rhetoric and their actual policy proposals.Director of Media Relations, Drug Policy AllianceWe have serious doubts that we\u0027ll see Trump at any future debates -- after all, if he can blow them off with impunity, why would he subject himself to them in the first place?Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comFrom Maple Muffins to Gingerbread, these easy breakfast breads will brighten even the coldest and darkest winter mornings.Chef, Recipe Developer and Busy MomKenneth Thorpe, an Emory University professor who served in the Clinton administration, claims Sanders\u0027s single-payer plan would break the bank. But his analysis rests on several incorrect, and occasionally outlandish, assumptions.Professor of Public Health at CUNY and Lecturer in Medicine at Harvard Medical SchoolProfessor in the CUNY School of Public Health at Hunter College; Lecturer in Medicine, Harvard Medical SchoolIt occurs to me that Bernie Sanders may not want to be President. Perhaps he knows in his heart that a self-proclaimed Socialist, even a Democratic Socialist, has no chance of winning in a general election outside of a few states with distinctly liberal tilts and a high percentage of college students.Playwright and retired Political Science Professor; former Writing Fellow at Quinnipiac UniversityWe each have an opportunity and responsibility -- as parents, children, friends, neighbors, business owners, employees, tax payers, citizens, and Americans -- to push the government, food industry, media, restaurants, cafes, schools, and workplaces, and everywhere else we eat, away from the bad and ugly and toward the good.Cardiologist, nutrition scientist, public health advocate and Dean, Friedman School of Nutrition Science \u0026 Policy, Tufts UniversityThis dish from David Tanis is absolutely delicious. Although aromatic and full of flavor, these spices marry so well, even the pickiest of eaters will enjoy this mellow curry. For those who like heat, increase the cayenne or add a fresh hot pepper or two while heating your chicken broth.Private chef, culinary school graduate and second-generation foodieThere are men in our communities who are predators and pedophiles. But not all men are like that. You are not like that. So I\u0027m asking you: will you please be our protectors? Would you be a voice of conscience to the men around you?Writer-mama and Jesus-girlHillary may have foreign policy experience, but when push came to shove, she showed an extreme lack of judgment on the most important foreign policy decision in a generation.Entertainment attorney, producer, writer and political activistFederal law has banned pay discrimination since 1963. But more than 50 years later, many in the American workplace -- because of their sex, race or ethnicity -- don\u0027t get equal pay for equal work.U.S. Secretary of LaborSenior Advisor to the President and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsChair of the Equal Employment Opportunity CommissionThey are serving as ambassadors for us in our quest to connect people with homeless animals and to save millions of lives.President and CEO, The Humane Society of the United StatesAllow me to let you in on a little secret: I, like presumably most Americans who support Bernie Sanders, do not expect miracles. But if Bernie Sanders is elected president, then maybe, just maybe, things will change. And that\u0027s worth a vote. That\u0027s worth trying.Radio/Podcast Producer \u0026 Host at WGN Radio, ChicagoThe road to my caucus location in Iowa on Monday will wind along an Iowa River valley littered with the reminders of record flooding and drought since the last election -- and a sea change on voters\u0027 priorities on climate action since 2008.Author of \"Damnatio Memoriae: A Play, Una Commedia,\" www.jeffbiggers.comKrugman is one of the few prominent writers on economic and political issues who has, on a number of occasions, admitted when he was mistaken, and forthrightly changed his position. I hope that he will reconsider his ideas in this case.Co-director, Center for Economic and Policy Research, Washington, D.C.If the U.S. is to be heard in the Muslim world, it will have to downplay all it believes true and blue -- and instead promote moderate, but illiberal Islam.Professor of international relations, George Washington UniversityThe bad news for Cruz was that because Trump wasn\u0027t present to take incoming from all the challengers, Cruz became the target of attacks from most of the other candidates.Hofstra Journalism ProfessorThere is so much beauty in the world. All you have to do is leave your comfort zone to see it.Associate Editor, Blogs \u0026 CommunityI understand that many white men -- and women and people of color as well -- who have been left out of this economy, who can\u0027t make ends meet, who feel that the American dream is not working for them, are very angry about this, and justifiably so. But I cannot countenance the misdirection of their anger.President of the Democracy AllianceIt may be 100 years before history can assess the role that this one human being called Marvin Minsky played in transforming our world. The impact of artificial intelligence -- so pervasive, so woven into the fabric of all that we do and think -- would not be as it is had Marvin not been among us.Creator \u0026 Host, Closer to TruthTrump is a reality star known for his business acumen, his parade of wives, (two of three are immigrants) and finally, his inability to display even the tiniest bit of sophistication, restraint, and civility when it comes to women\u0027s rights.DuPont and Peabody award-winning journalistAfter 10 years as a business owner, I encountered a specific kind of sexism this week that I\u0027ve actually never come across before.Founder, EdgarIn our house we now have many beds, some king-sized, others single, and we swap and change according to weather, mood, snoring level and tolerance.Novelist, obituary writer, cancer survivorVarious expressions of regret and statements acknowledging the role of the Japanese military in operating the \"comfort women\" system have been made, but none have unconditionally acknowledged that Japan as a state was responsible for these violations.President, International Center for Transitional JusticeGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
