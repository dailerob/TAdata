{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundDespite the loud voice of the National Rifle Association (NRA), scholars, experts on school safety, and teachers overwhelmingly disagree with turning schools into armed camps rather than places of nonviolent positive learning. School safety is a non-negotiable priority. The current national debate about how best to achieve school safety is a natural result of the horror we feel when violence happens at a school like the unbearable Newtown, Connecticut massacre of 20 small children and their teachers. We must do all we can to end school and community violence, but we need to make the right choices and make sure the solutions are effective and do not create other dangerous consequences for children.Comments (297)Ben GoldacrePhysician, authorDoctors need the results of clinical trials to make informed choices, with their patients, about which treatment to use. But the best currently available evidence estimates that half of all clinical trials, for the treatments we use today, have never been published.Comments (568)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027We would take the time to sound out each syllable, word, and sentence until they got it right, \"With malice toward none, with charity for all ...\" While they were learning to read, I wanted them to absorb the words of Lincoln.Comments (44)Arianna HuffingtonThis week, several of our reporters consider the past, present and future of gun control measures in the wake of December\u0027s mass shooting in Newtown. Sam Stein takes us back to the political fallout of the 1994 assault weapons ban, Howard Fineman interviews NRA president David Keene, and Christina Wilkie spotlights a non-profit that has backed a flurry of lawsuits designed to expand gun rights.Comments (109)Dylan RatiganNew York Times Best-Selling author and formerly the host of MSNBC\u0027s The Dylan Ratigan ShowAn awakening is happening in America, and it is as simple as creating jobs that solve our actual needs and, in the process, restore the very fabric of our own bodies and our relationship with the very planet we inhabit.Comments (96)Marion JohnsonBlogger, Feed It to My GoldfishIt goes like this: a female character judges the male protagonist\u0027s bad behavior in a completely rational way, and the audience hates her for it.Comments (48)James ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027If Obama\u0027s observations in his Jerusalem speech are correct, then not only the Israeli public needs to heed his injunction \"to see the world through their [Palestinian] eyes.\" U.S. policymakers need to do the same. This is especially important as Secretary of State John Kerry visits the region in a renewed effort at peacemaking.Comments (24)Devon CornealLawyer, MotherYou know what makes our ideas and opinions less important? Pretending that we are so fragile that we can\u0027t handle a healthy and robust debate.Comments (111)Marilyn Wedge, Ph.D.Family Therapist; AuthorMost writers, including myself, present a preferred reality to their readers. It is only natural for a writer to selectively choose or cherry pick outcomes in order to portray a certain image.CommentsEmma JohnsonWealthySingleMommy.comLadies, here\u0027s how your ex feels about you.Comments (156)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorDespite negative public sentiment and the rise of the Occupy movement, the avarice on Wall Street arrogantly continues on. The big banks are now even bigger and more powerful than they were in 2008 when they were bailed out by the U.S. taxpayers.Comments (137)Liquor.comLiquor.comThe one thing \u0027Mad Men\u0027 characters consistently do right? Drink.Comments (11)Leonard MaltinFilm critic and historianThe role of critics has been marginalized by the growth of the Internet and the empowerment of self-made bloggers who are eager to share their opinions. But few, if any, of these wannabes will ever surpass Roger Ebert.Comments (47)Hollee Actman BeckerWriter and author of the blog suburbabble.comIt\u0027s time for us to take our collective blinders off and really pay attention. Because the minute we give our kids an iPhone or iPod or any other gadget that puts technology quite literally in the palms of their hands, we become responsible for whatever happens next.Comments (372)John WendelWriterSince the recent release of my wife Susan Spencer-Wendel\u0027s memoir, Until I Say Good-Bye, people often say to me, \"Your wife is such an inspiration.\" Or: \"This woman changed my outlook on life.\"Comments (13)David Valdes Greenwood\u0027Screen Dad\u0027 and Author, \u0027Homo Domesticus: Notes from a Same-Sex Marriage\u0027You\u0027ll do better with this film if you don\u0027t think about it as offering meaningful messages at all. As entertainment, the film is a rip-snorting barn-burner.CommentsRep. Diana DeGetteChief Deputy WhipThe gun lobby will take every opportunity to intimidate, and to attempt to silence, anyone with the courage of conviction to stand up and fight to keep our families safe.Comments (702)Kellee KhalilFounder and CEO, Lover.lyAs April showers roll in, you don\u0027t need to worry that the rain will ruin your wedding day (or your wedding photos). As these couples prove, a rainy wedding day can actually set the scene for gorgeous, romantic photos.CommentsGov. Martin O\u0027MalleyGovernor of MarylandThe children that were lost in Newtown were our children. The children that are lost to gun violence in neighborhoods throughout America are our children. And the lives that we can save tomorrow are our children\u0027s lives.Comments (577)Gloria GaynorSingerThe \"Queen is dead,\" was the report rumored to be circulating around my record company. Three months of physical therapy fraught with uncertainty about my career and ability to become financially stable again, ended with me approaching despair.Comments (32)Brian Secemsky, M.D.Resident PhysicianWhile I am the first to admit to having pursued past research in this mindset (perhaps too publicly), I know that I am not the last -- so much so that many readers within my field won\u0027t bat an eye when agreeing to have done this at some point in their medical careers.CommentsMichelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesThe sappy media stories paint the Salmons as a loving family where even \"differences\" over gay marriage can\u0027t come between them. But if you\u0027re working against rights for your own child in the name of your religious faith, then you love yourself and your beliefs more than you love your kid.Comments (384)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThis looks to me like a confirmation of the basic truth that policy matters, especially at a time like this. And from the perspective of a labor market that has yet to reliably show consistent signs of solid gains, we\u0027re simply not making the right policy choices.Comments (413)Robert SchraderWriter, photographer and editor of LeaveYourDailyHell.comThe dissonance between the \"traveler\" archetype the public craves and the one we travelers actually embody is a result of today\u0027s traveler being fundamentally different than it has been at any point in even recent history.CommentsMarcelle Pick, OB-GYN N.P.Co-founder, Women to WomenAccording to a recent study, 60 to 80 percent of visits to primary care doctors may be related to stress, yet only 3 percent of patients receive stress management counseling. Why is it that so few people are getting help from their health care practitioners when it comes to stress?Comments (13)Raymond J. LearsyAuthor, \u0027Oil and Finance: The Epic Corruption Continues\u0027Along with this new focus and responsibility, it is also high time that the nation establishes a Strategic Grain Reserve much in keeping with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.Comments (48)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activist\"Stories can conquer fear,\" Nigerian novelist Ben Okri once said. \"They can make the heart bigger.\" There\u0027s a world of truth to that statement. As someone who comes from a long line of storytellers, I\u0027ve always said that our lives are just long and rich stories, knit together over the years, that tell us not only about ourselves, but the human condition, as well.Comments (26)Mike RyanSenior Entertainment Writer, The Huffington PostNo one has successfully launched a film-review television series since Siskel \u0026 Ebert. I think that\u0027s because all who have tried have made the audience feel stupid in one of two ways -- either by being too knowledgable, in a way that\u0027s alienating, or by being not knowledgable enough, in a way that makes you think, Why am I watching this?Comments (100)Annette InsdorfDirector of undergraduate film studies, Columbia University, and author of PHILIP KAUFMANHe knew that his days were numbered, and he filled them with as much intelligent love of film as possible. For those of us who were lucky enough to know Roger, his life was a gift.CommentsAmitai EtzioniProfessor of international relations, George Washington UniversityNPR\u0027s social science maven reported that President Obama may have undermined the success of gun control legislation when he stated that \"We are responsible for each other.\" Americans, Shankar Vendantam stated, care about individual rights and liberty, not the common good.Comments (50)John CorvinoChair of Philosophy, Wayne State UniversityBy spreading lies about the \"homosexual lifestyle,\" and by teaching kids, and especially vulnerable LGBT youth, that there\u0027s something sick, wrong or unnatural about being gay, folks like Rep. Dave Agema increase the suicide risk that they then turn around and use to justify their anti-gay rants.CommentsGeorge Heymont, 2013. 6.04Mark Brennan Rosenberg, 2013. 6.04Catherine McKenzie, 2013. 6.04Lisa Steinberg, 2013. 6.04Kim Siegal, 2013. 6.04Rob Schware, 2013. 6.04Maryka Biaggio, 2013. 6.04Alvin McEwen, 2013. 6.04Robert Julian, 2013. 6.04Jason Apuzzo, 2013. 6.04Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"HILLSTERIA",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
