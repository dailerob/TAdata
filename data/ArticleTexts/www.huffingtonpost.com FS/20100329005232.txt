{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOThe GOP playbook on health care only had two lines: \"scare people\" and \"make stuff up.\" The result was a resounding defeat. Republicans responded to the clanging wakeup call by...offering up more of the same. This week brought the petulant shutting down of Senate committees; a desperate attempt to turn a slip of the tongue by Rep. John Dingell into a totalitarian smoking gun; and Sarah Palin adorning her Facebook page with 20 gun sights, one for each of the Democrats \"targeted\" by her PAC. This craziness has consequences. Witness the threats and vandalism directed at Democratic lawmakers, and the Harris poll finding that 38 percent of Republicans say Obama is doing many things Hitler did, and 24 percent believe Obama might be the Antichrist. However flawed this poll -- even if the numbers are a fraction of these -- this is certifiable. And very troubling. To quote Joe Biden: This is a big effing deal.Read Post | Comments (516)BIOPaul Begala, 03.21.2010CNN political commentatorI have been working for Democratic and progressive causes for 29 years, and I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever been prouder than today.
