{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Now that Herman Cain has \"suspended his campaign,\" the race is down to three people: Newt Gingrich, Mitt Romney, and Newt Gingrich. At this point, the question isn\u0027t so much whether Gingrich can beat Romney (he can), but whether Gingrich will beat Gingrich. This task is complicated by the fact that there isn\u0027t just one Gingrich. He\u0027s a very Walt Whitmanesque candidate -- he celebrates himself, he sings of himself, he is large, and he contains multitudes. And while both men are serial flip-floppers, the differentiating variable between them isn\u0027t consistency; it\u0027s conviction. Whereas Romney tries to reconcile his flip-flops with lawyerly logic, Newt has the ability to seemingly believe each of his contradictory positions with absolute conviction. And for better or worse -- usually worse -- the natural selection of our political process strongly favors that trait.Read Post | Comments (72)Deb Roy, 12/ 5/11Director, MIT Media Lab\u0027s Cognitive Machines groupWe are creating learning systems to interpret the intended meaning of social media comments made \"in the wild.\" We call our television dataset the TV Genome.Read Post | CommentsMarie L.
