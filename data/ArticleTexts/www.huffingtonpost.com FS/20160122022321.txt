{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Director, Represent.UsCommunications Director, Represent.UsOverturning Citizens United is an important and worthy cause, but it is not the panacea so many presidential candidates, pundits, and activists claim. If Citizens United were thrown out tomorrow, it would remain perfectly legal for special interests to fund the political careers of the politicians who regulate them, send public servants on lavish vacations disguised as fundraising junkets, and generally do whatever it takes to keep their lobbyists writing our laws. Just like it was before the Supreme Court\u0027s 2010 decision. A single-minded focus on overturning Citizens United actually hurts our nation\u0027s chances at meaningful anti-corruption reform.Inevitably, any Clinton campaign carries a lot of baggage that simply has to be overcome. But what is plaguing the Clinton campaign are less the sins of the past than the strategic choices of the present -- particularly her decision to be the candidate of big money.President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureCitizens United was bad history, bad logic, bad law. Nobody with any common sense thinks that huge corporate expenditures don\u0027t corrupt politics, but the Court left common sense behind that day.CEO of MAYDAY.US, Associate Law Professor at Fordham, Corruption ScholarAs we watch the Republican primary unfold, it\u0027s easy to forget for most of the candidates, there are two campaigns. There\u0027s only one official campaign, of course, but with one notable exception, every single one of the GOP candidates has a multi-million dollar super PAC supporting them.Candidate for U.S. Senate in WisconsinI was shocked and dismayed at a meeting yesterday of the Environment and Public Works Committee (EPW) to consider S. 659, the so-called \"Bipartisan Sportsmen Act,\" which included an unrelated amendment that weakens our nation\u0027s drinking water protections.Ranking Member, Senate Environment and Public Works CommitteeTraveling from city to city in the U.S. and having the gut wrenching task of asking people to relive their most heartbreaking moments, I began to see through the smoke and mirrors the NRA has so masterfully created.Filmmaker, Brave New FoundationThis week the Human Rights Campaign, the largest LGBT group, endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. It was a bit of a shocker not because HRC endorsed a Democrat but that it occurred before even one vote has been cast in the Democratic primaries.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostThe civic minds of the people are sidelined by the monetized minds of a corrupted commercial media, political consultants, pundits and the purveyors of an ever-more dictatorial corporate state.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorI was anxious to see the movie since I was The Boston Globe reporter who first broke the story about a molesting priest in Massachusetts. Let me say right up front that Spotlight is a riveting movie that gets a lot right. However, there are a few things the film doesn\u0027t get quite right.Award-winning journalist, author and journalism professorThey enter the refugee camps with entitlement, asking people to pose for their self-profiting creations, without even understanding the situation of the individual.Syrian photographer, filmmaker, NGO worker, and volunteerThis week, many of the various factions of the anti-abortion movement will gather in Washington for the March For Life, an annual event that marks the anniversary of the Supreme Court\u0027s decision in Roe v. Wade.Senior Researcher for Special Projects, People For the American WayBecause of increased focus on neuromyelitis optica spectrum disease, there may be up to 250,000 or more NMO patients worldwide. Still, drug companies have less business incentive in finding a treatment for this rare illness.President of The Stem for Life FoundationPolls show that Trump and Texas Senator Ted Cruz are neck and neck in Iowa; so securing just a few additional votes may mean victory. That is where former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin comes in.Hofstra Journalism ProfessorThe fact that so many commentators are focusing on a supposedly cultural dimension to the Cologne violence highlights the growing fear that the moral outrage is guided more by racism against refugees than concern for women.Iranian-American journalist and PhD student of Anthropology at the University of ChicagoNew England Patriots defensive lineman Chandler Jones apologized on Thursday for \"a pretty stupid mistake\" related to his use of \"synthetic marijuana,\" but what was the mistake?Program Associate at the Drug Policy AllianceThe U.S. spent $25 billion on \"training, equipping, and sustaining\" Iraqi security forces. Along the way, Pentagon spokesmen offered up an unending stream of good news about the new Iraqi Army. Yet, that same force collapsed in the face of assaults just two and a half years after U.S. withdrawal.Managing Editor, TomDispatch.comQueer women continue to be disadvantaged in an environment that often doesn\u0027t even let them in the door.Writer and CriticThis kind of unregulated campaign finance system has resulted in massive corruption scandals in the past. It will do so again in the future. Citizens United has brought an onslaught of big money from the Super Rich who are treating federal campaigns as their political playground.President, Democracy 21A new and alarming mash-up of Silicon Valley technology and Wall Street greed is thrusting upon us the latest economic fad: the so-called \"sharing economy.\" In reality, workers at companies like Uber and Airbnb have little choice but to hire themselves out for ever-smaller jobs and wages, with no safety net, while the companies profit.Senior Fellow at New America, author of \"Raw Deal: How the \u0027Uber Economy\u0027 and Runaway Capitalism Are Screwing American Workers\"Being a flight attendant has it\u0027s ups and downs and although it\u0027s usually perceived as being an easy or glamorous job, having an office in the sky offers a unique and stressful working environment.www.catchmeifyoucannie.comOn January 20, 2017, America will begin our next chapter. A new president will stand on the steps of the Capitol, raise one hand, and take the oath of office. From that moment on, he or she will decide whether we defend and build on the progress we\u0027ve made under President Obama -- or tear it all away.Democratic candidate for President; Former Secretary of State, U. S. Senator and First LadyMy beloved, fractious Venezuela offers a cautionary tale to the United States: You don\u0027t want your democracy to end up looking like ours. This has not only polluted the public sphere -- it also invaded the private one, soiling relations among friends, parents, wives, husbands and children.Journalist and authorIt\u0027s now possible to envision a world where our daughters and granddaughters have fewer rights than we did. With Hillary, we can make sure that bad dream never comes true.Actress, ActivistThis is an enormously consequential shift in food and agriculture, and it is a clear signal to everyone concerned that gestation crates and battery cages are soon to be agricultural artifacts like the reaper and the threshing machine.President and CEO, The Humane Society of the United StatesMr. Malone, are you the mailman who wants to help deliver the news that some sanity needs to be injected into our gun culture? Or are you the gunman whose silence helps perpetuate the killing? The shot clock\u0027s running.Freelance writer, communications facilitator using improv comedy techniques, lost a niece to gun violence..We assume that low achievement indicates a poor school when, in fact, it is merely proof of a neglected community. We persistently fail to address the economic and social injustices that created the community and then we blame schools and teachers for the mayhem we have enabled.Head of the Calhoun School in ManhattanIt was not very long ago that information shared with your doctor was sacrosanct, at the same remove from exposure as utterances made under the protection of an attorney-client relationship or pillow talk in a spousal bed. That may no longer be the case -- and the fallout could be life-threatening.Author of Swiped.
