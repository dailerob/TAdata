{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"lincolnmitchell.comThe Bergdahl controversy is almost a caricature of American political discourse in the Obama era, with both sides taking strong and outspoken positions based simply on whether or not they like the president, fighting in the media over something that is not very important, and making sure that the public bickering obscures more significant government decisions and policies. One way to see this is to see how easily each side could take the opposite position. If Obama had refused to make the deal, John McCain, Marco Rubio and others would be climbing over each other to denounce President Obama for violating the sacred trust that the military has with each soldier. Tea Party supporters would be waving signs about how Obama is anti-American and contemptuous of the military and its traditions.To a teenage girl, 50 days can seem like a lifetime. Today marks the 50th day that over 200 schoolgirls, kidnapped from their school in Chibok by Boko Haram, remain in captivity.Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationI don\u0027t think we\u0027ve ever seen a dedicated media campaign to not only undermine a returning prisoner of war, but to also cast doubt onto the soldier\u0027s family; to portray them as un-American even as they prepare for their reunion.Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaAnyone born within the last 50 years would be justified in thinking that Jesus\u0027 teachings and Christian preachings were the exclusive domain of social and fiscal conservatives.Executive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostWhen I read about the resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases like measles, polio or pertussis, I worry -- and wish that there wasn\u0027t so much fear about vaccines.Pediatrician, Boston Children\u0027s Hospital, Harvard Medical SchoolWhat we require is a wholesale mass-decarceration initiative that acknowledges the traumatic generational effects on the communities we\u0027ve failed.Founder and Chief Risk Taker, JustLeadershipUSAOn Wall Street, the debate about wealth inequality is all but over, except for finding ways to make tons of money from it.Chief financial writer, The Huffington PostImmigration judges regularly decide the fate of immigrants -- and their often U.S.-based families -- in less time than it takes to make your way through airport security.Legislative Counsel, ACLUThe dangers from human-induced climate change are real and the climate science is sound. Deniers will probably shriek in the coming days, yet their scientific credibility is now nearly zero and sinking fast.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \"To Move the World: JFK\u0027s Quest for Peace\"At critical periods in our nation\u0027s history, progress becomes inevitable. The momentum is almost palpable, as Americans come together to make a collective decision to right a wrong, or to expand opportunity.Harvard Law School Jesse Climenko Professor of Law; Founding and Executive Director of the Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race and JusticeManaging Director of the Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race and Justice, Harvard Law SchoolDirector of Strategic Planning for the Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race and Justice, Harvard Law SchoolSuccess, achievement, wealth, power, innovation are all things to strive for.

I\u0027d love for those boycotting to be lions that roar at Brunei, not little mice that squeak at a hotel chain.Actress; Director of this year\u0027s Sundance selected short film \u0027Dawn\u0027Shame on China\u0027s regime. But shame on us, as well. Why? Because the United States laid significant groundwork for the formation of the modern, post-Tiananmen Chinese police state. And our culpability can be spelled out in four letters: PNTR (Permanent Normalized Trade Relations)President, Alliance for American ManufacturingWhy has the gluten-free trend taken off like wildfire in the last few years while the FODMAP diet has not really caught on even though it was developed way back in 1999 and shown to have a high success rate for people with IBS and even other gastrointestinal issues?Fitness Expert, Health Coach, Co-Creator/Owner of AbAssist PlusHockey is an emotional game, especially in the playoffs. Nevertheless, there is a right way and a wrong way to handle the emotions. One thing a player can never do, however, is use physical force against an official.Retired NHL Player and NHL Referee, ECAC Director of Hockey Officiating, Chairman KHL Officiating Evaluation and Discipline CommitteesIn the summer of 2009, I worked as an adviser in Kabul, Afghanistan. My team shared a basement with the ISAF\u0027s Public Relations team, and the hottest news story during my stay was the recent capture of U.S. soldier Private Bowe Bergdahl.Professor of Islamic studies, U. Mass Dartmouth; author, \u0027Predators\u0027 and \u0027The Last Warlord\u0027On March 27, the very day we reached 100,000 signatures, another petition on the White House\u0027s We the People website also hit the mark. Sponsored by Budweiser and promoted through a professional ad campaign, \"Declare Major League Baseball Opening Day a National Holiday\" has already been graced with an official White House reply.Co-Founder and Executive Director, Charley’s FundWhat at first seemed very clear-cut almost instantly became clouded in fog. This fog may clear some when the Army makes a formal statement about the circumstances of Bergdahl\u0027s capture by the Taliban, but until that point the speculation is running pretty wild.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comModi campaigned as a leader who can deliver. He should take the initiative to press the police and the criminal justice system to be more responsive to cases of sexual violence.Defending human rights world wideI have, more or less, officially survived 31 days of restricted smartphone use. 31 long days of reaching for my phone while stopped at red lights and waiting for trains, only to realize I wasn\u0027t allowed to do it.TV Editor, HuffPost TVThe central midfielder says he is motivated by a U.S. soccer system that is ever strengthening, and if the national team is to match his ambitions, one has to think that Bradley will play an integral role in making Jürgen Klinsmann\u0027s men tick.The magazine the beautiful game deservesNo matter how much you plan to spend, it is critical to buy a ring from a reliable source with an excellent reputation. Otherwise, you risk overpaying or getting a product with an undisclosed flaw, or a custom design that\u0027s not exactly what you had in mind.President, The Appraisal FoundationPsychological scientists are very interested in the dynamics of future planning, in part because people are so bad at it. There is circumstantial evidence that people who are financially irresponsible also take poor care of themselves. Is it possible that a single underlying trait is shaping behaviors that promote both health and wealth?Author, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027The largest prison education program in California is thriving at Ironwood State Prison, where men are transcribing college textbooks into Braille, learning trade skills and where an astonishing 1200 students have earned college degrees.Executive Producer of The Hangover film franchise, founder of The Anti-Recidivism Coalition (ARC)I have been involved in sports, like track, cross-country and soccer for a long time because I enjoy playing them. But when I was growing up, I never felt like part of any team or group.

Use it in your writing, he said.Narrative Designer at MachineGames StudiosI\u0027m not an economist or a scientist. I can tell you how baking powder and baking soda react. I can warn you not to knead your dough too much. But the fact is, you don\u0027t have to be a scientist to understand that we\u0027re throwing too much bad stuff into the air to expect much good back.Cooking up Pastries and PoliticsFor most of us, it\u0027s time to stop rolling our eyes at non-existent conspiracies, and actually attempt to eat well and be active. It means there is no scapegoat to blame for all our ills, and no silver bullet to save us.Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterIf I started a business and it was clearly failing, I would shut it down.
