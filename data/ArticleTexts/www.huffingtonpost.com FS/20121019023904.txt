{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Executive Arts and Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post Media GroupI have a secret: I can\u0027t wait for this election season to be over. It\u0027s not that I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a lot at stake. There is. It\u0027s just that, as usual, we\u0027re not talking about the real problems facing the country, and real solutions for dealing with them. One candidate has apparently decided that the best strategy is to avoid talking to anyone who isn\u0027t already on his side. When you find out what he\u0027s been saying to the people he does trust, you can understand why. The other candidate, whom we\u0027ve sternly instructed to stop spending so much time running the country so he can look tougher on TV, hasn\u0027t articulated any new ideas. His central argument -- I cleaned up their mess and killed the guy they couldn\u0027t find -- has a certain elemental appeal, but it\u0027s not exactly the stuff Spielberg movies are made of.Read Post | Comments (95)Gary Hart, 10/18/12President, Hart International, Ltd.If George McGovern represents the political losers of the world, then I for one am proud to stand with him.Read Post | Comments (78)Barbara Bush, 10.18.2012CEO and Co-founder, Global Health CorpsGlobal Health Corps is dedicated to the premise that Health is a Human Right.

I think that\u0027s all it should take to make you think differently about bullying, an issue most of us don\u0027t spend a lot of time on, but should.Read Post | Comments (79)Howard Fineman, 10/18/12Editorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupI\u0027ll leave it to others, at least for now, to explain the decline and fall of Newsweek. At this point I would prefer to remember better times.Read Post | Comments (93)Shannon Bradley-Colleary, 10/18/12Aging vaintress, wife dominatrix, mom butler and humble author who is slightly mustachioedI\u0027m willing to whisper sweet nothings to Henry in Spanish so if he closes his eyes he\u0027s making love to Salma Hayek.

Hypocrisy is the glue that holds it all together.Read Post | Comments (116)Aaron Gray, 10/18/12Founder and CEO, The Legacy MovementJob fulfillment can be leveraged to assess the skills mismatch that many employers claim exists in the country. A great start to tackling this problem can be broken down with the following, distinct steps.Read Post | CommentsDaniel Ellsberg, 10/18/12Former American military analyst who sparked a national uproar in 1971.I don\u0027t \u0027support Obama.\u0027 I oppose the current Republican Party. The only way for progressives and Democrats to block Romney from office, at this date, is to persuade enough people in swing states to vote for Obama: not stay home, or vote for someone else.Read Post | Comments (578)Marty Kaplan, 10/18/12Director, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolNo one\u0027s being forced to watch CNN\u0027s campaign swing-o-meter. But it can\u0027t be long before real-time tabulation of the sentiments of various audience segments becomes an expected and common element of all infotainment.Read Post | CommentsMatthew Palevsky and Jeremy Heimans, 10/18/12If you\u0027d like to work at a large corporation that happens to have a bullying CEO at its helm, you\u0027re now expected to conform to the political agenda of that corporation with your vote and perhaps even with your own personal finances.Read Post | Comments (31)Brian D. McLaren, 10/16/12Author of \"A New Kind of Christianity\" and \"Naked Spirituality\" (brianmclaren.net)\"People don\u0027t want to have to side with the church and against their friends who are Buddhist or Muslim or Jewish or agnostic.\"Read Post | Comments (459)Jared Bernstein, 10/17/12Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorRemember, when Bob Dole tried Romney\u0027s argument back in 1996, it was a huge loser for him. The timing isn\u0027t nearly as supportive for the president, but the truth is that things are slowly getting better and Romney\u0027s claims to the contrary may be drowned out by this reality.Read Post | Comments (751)Richard (RJ) Eskow, 10/17/12Writer; host, \u0027The Breakdown\u0027; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureWe heard a lot of discussion about employment and economic recovery. But there wasn\u0027t much talk about why the economy\u0027s in such bad shape. No mention of the bankers whose illegal and unethical behavior triggered the financial crisis.Read Post | Comments (165)Joseph A. Palermo, 10/18/12Associate professor, historian, authorThe hate brigades have taken aim at Ms. Crowley not because she showed \"bias\" or was \"wrong\" about the facts or exceeded the role of moderator, but because she performed a genuine act of journalism in front of 65 million viewers.Read Post | Comments (442)Bob Cesca, 10/17/12Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez Show, Media ProducerThis was arguably one of those historic debate sequences which I believe will be replayed for many years to come. The challenger, riding a wave of solid polls following a strong first debate, literally imploded on the national stage.Read Post | Comments (2,405)Kate White, 10/18/12Former Editor-in-chief of Cosmopolitan and bestselling authorThankfully, those women\u0027s groups in Massachusetts were extremely proactive and it paid off, because Romney did appoint more women than usual to his cabinet. We need more proactivity like that. But individually, we also have to help ourselves lose invisible status.Read Post | Comments (12)Dr. Jonny Bowden, 10/17/12Jonny Bowden, PhD, C.N.S.Drop those two \"foods\" from your diet, and the guardian angels of your health and well-being will be sending you a heartfelt and passionate \"thank you!\"Read Post | Comments (115)Dr. Diana E. Sheets, 10/18/12iFoundry Fellow at the University of Illinois; Political commentator and writerObama\u0027s vision is a postmodern (PoMo), postcolonial (PoCo) America in which truth and lie merge, everything becomes relativistic, rather than based on Christianity, which shaped the beliefs of America\u0027s Founders. Then, there is Mitt Romney\u0027s America. It embraces our historic destiny.Read Post | Comments (435)Dilip Hiro, 10/18/12Author, \u0027Blood of the Earth: The Battle for the World’s Vanishing Oil Resources\u0027While the two governments and their peoples become more suspicious and resentful of each other with every passing month, Washington and Islamabad are still locked in an awkward post-9/11 embrace that, at this juncture, neither can afford to let go of.Read Post | CommentsCraig Kanalley, 10/18/12Senior Editor, Big News \u0026 Live Events, The Huffington PostOK, people in Canada care. Hockey fans care. I care. But is there a critical mass up in arms about the lockout? Not even close.

Currently, genetically engineered (GE) foods are not labeled, so we have no way of knowing if the food we are eating is a product of this artificial process.Read Post | Comments (25)Dan Froomkin, 10/17/12Senior Washington Correspondent, Huffington PostFar from reversing the Bush-Cheney executive power grab, President Obama is taking it to new extremes. More than a decade after it started, we still have no clue how much the government is listening in on us or reading our email. And the government\u0027s response to this unprecedented secrecy is a war on leaks.Read Post | Comments (479)Douglas Anthony Cooper, 10/15/12Novelist, Amnesia (See: Blogger Mortis)I expect most people wouldn\u0027t send donations if they knew what the Humane Society of the United States actually was. It doesn\u0027t run any shelters. It has no veterinary clinics. A good deal of their funding comes from people who don\u0027t have the slightest idea of their real agenda.Read Post | Comments (409)Michele Weiner-Davis, 10/18/12Author, relationship expert, Founder of www.divorcebusting.comEven if two people are not engaged in a physical relationship, the emotional attachment can threaten the very foundation and fabric of the marriage.Read Post | Comments (57)Michael Rosenblum, 10/18/12Video producer, founder of Current TV, and NYU professor of communicationThe Tea Party may love to make references back to the Founding Fathers and the Constitution, but really the culture we have created (and continue to create) is vastly different from what the nation was like 150 years ago. And it\u0027s only going to get worse.Read Post | Comments (21)Lorraine Devon Wilke, 10/18/12Writer of Sass \u0026 SensibilityThis is between you and all your confused, reluctant, fence-sitting voters who still can\u0027t figure out which of you to vote for.
