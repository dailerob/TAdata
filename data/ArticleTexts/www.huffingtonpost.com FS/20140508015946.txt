{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Timothy KarrSenior Director of Strategy, Free PressThe Arab Spring and other protest movements have evolved into a digital game of cat and mouse: Online activists and new media journalists devise ingenious new ways to get around firewalls to connect with others and report from the streets while repressive regimes deploy new technologies to turn the Web into a surveillance and censorship machine. Today, when asked whether the Internet has been a force for good or evil, media scholar Zeynep Tufekci likes to answer \"Yes.\" In other words, it\u0027s both the best of times and the worst of times for the free speech rights the network is supposed to support. To break the cycle of repression we must look more closely at the tools protesters and reporters use and ask whether they further the cause of freedom?--?or just make speakers more vulnerable.We can only get married because millions of people took a stand to defend and protect us. The gay people of Brunei -- and Russia, and Uganda, and many other countries -- need us to take another stand today.Elton JohnDavid FurnishIt seems that the more students, teachers, and families express concern about Common Core and high-stakes testing, the more its proponents rush to defend the indefensible with unsubstantiated claims for their wonderfulness.Alan SingerSocial studies educator, Hofstra UniversityEvery Imam who takes the pulpit this Friday should at the very least pray for our sisters in Nigeria as well as every woman who faces religious persecution and oppression at the hands of those who claim to act on God\u0027s behalf.Imam Khalid LatifExecutive Director and Chaplain, Islamic Center at New York UniversityWe\u0027ve accomplished storytelling on the silver screen and the latest Internet meme, but is the art of storytelling dead when it comes to complicated, politically charged issues like our environment and the need for swift action to combat climate change?Robert RedfordActor, director and environmental activistI\u0027m not just a \"paralyzed bride.\" I\u0027m Rachelle, a regular girl who had everything going for her when it all came crashing down. And my dear friend, who had only innocent intentions, is not just the girl who pushed me.Rachelle FriedmanBlogger; speaker; ambassador for the spinal cord injury communityBeing disillusioned with your life\u0027s path is a symptom, not a sickness. In other words, it\u0027s a sign of something much deeper that you have to address. You can\u0027t just throw money at universities and expect them to cure your life\u0027s woes.Kevin KleitchesEntrepreneur and lifestyle blogger, PeoplePassionate.comMarie is part of the \"college girls\" category, but this is as far as the truth stretches; the picture beside her sex chat persona is a voluptuous, sultry brunette. The reality is a petite and softly-spoken blonde who seems as far removed from an insatiable, risque vixen as you can get.Ella JamesonFreelance writerMore Americans than ever believe the economy is rigged in favor of Wall Street and big business and their enablers in Washington. We\u0027re five years into a so-called recovery that\u0027s been a bonanza for the rich but a bust for the middle class.Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027In order for us to see real progress on climate change, our politicians need be just as embarrassed to stand next to the CEO of ExxonMobil as they would be to stand with the head of Philip Morris.Jamie HennCo-founder and Communications Director, 350.orgWhen you spend four years researching a book on dogs and cats, you learn some surprising things.David GrimmAward-winning journalist, teacher, and book authorI\u0027ve become accustomed to the looks of disbelief from people who didn\u0027t know I was homeless or that I had a mini stroke while homeless.Carey FullerHomeless motherI spent MANY years hating and hiding a body I was ashamed of because it wasn\u0027t society\u0027s ideal of beautiful. Being asked to send a photo of myself with a shirt on made me feel like I again should be ashamed of my body.Brooke BirminghamHealthy lifestyle bloggerWhen I think about my mom, I wonder what a difference these relationships with a variety of other women across the globe might have made in her life. In our lives, too, my brothers\u0027 and sister\u0027s and mine. I know that it\u0027s had an immeasurably positive impact on my life.Meagan FrancisMeagan Francis, TheHappiestHome.comWhen Pensacola, Florida, gets two feet of rain in 26 hours, that is exactly the kind of extreme and destructive event that scientists have long warned will become way more common.Al GoreChairman, Generation Investment Management and The Climate Reality ProjectDon\u0027t say I didn\u0027t warn you what a Supreme Court led by a Chief Justice John Roberts would be like on separation of church and state. In 2005, I was invited to be an expert witness in the Judiciary Committee\u0027s confirmation hearings on John Roberts appointment to be Chief Justice.Rev. Dr. Susan Brooks ThistlethwaiteProfessor of Theology, Chicago Theological SeminaryYet, while its role regionally and globally may never have been greater, recent events -- most notably the abduction of more than 200 schoolgirls by the Islamist armed group Boko -- show that Nigeria faces a serious domestic test of its stability which also threatens regional peace and security.Salil ShettyYour phone\u0027s camera can also be a practical tool. I use my smartphone camera for all sorts of things that no one would ever consider a \"Kodak moment.\"Larry MagidTechnology journalistRewarding Brunei, the first East Asian nation to follow in the footsteps of Taliban-era Afghanistan by stoning gays to death, will send a grotesque message to the world.Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesYes, Secretary Shinseki does owe us an explanation. But he owes it after a thorough investigation of these serious allegations is able to determine exactly what happened. Shinseki has stated that if the investigation substantiates allegations of employee misconduct, swift and appropriate action will be taken.Jon SoltzCo-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranThere are so many gay men who treat other gay men with love and respect. I definitely want to acknowledge that. But we, as individual gay men, can make our lives and lives of other gay men even richer, pleasant, and vibrant by choosing our words wisely and speaking from the heart.Josh HershLife coach and entrepreneurTea Party groups have evolved over time. Initially, they were supposed to be grassroots, libertarian, and spontaneous; but there were many who almost immediately attempted to grab the Tea Party mantle and turn it into their own giant political machine.Chris WeigantPolitical writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comTonight on PBS, I have a conversation with Vermont Governor Peter Shumlin, who tomorrow will make history when he signs a bill that makes his state the first in the nation to require labeling of all genetically modified food.Tavis SmileyPBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorI believe you can change the world through sex. My team and I are working to make sex better for all of us and to provide a healthy, real-world counterpoint to the ubiquitous influence of porn. The world of business and tech is doing everything it possibly can to stop us.Cindy GallopFounder, IfWeRanTheWorld.comWhat do we mean by \"appreciation\" when we talk about our nation\u0027s teachers? How do we appreciate those who give so much of themselves while constantly hearing the fabricated refrain of public school failure?Jason EndacottAssistant Professor of Social Studies, University of Arkansas; Blogger, EduSanityIn theory, U.S. law protects even prisoners. A combination of a \"get-tough\" attitude coupled with ignorance of medical issues can result in tragedy, in which the prisoner has no redress.Rabbi Shmuly YanklowitzEducator, activist and writerIngraham\u0027s idea is a dud all the way around. Not only that, it runs counter to what most Americans want: a solution to our country\u0027s broken immigration solution. Ingraham\u0027s pledge is remarkable only for being pathetic and pointless.Raul A. ReyesAttorney; USA Today Columnist, NBC News ContributorI turn to face the truth -- that my baby girl is gone and it hurts like hell rolled over on me. I open my empty arms, throwing them around the pain, embracing the suffering, and scream out, \"I don\u0027t want to be numb -- I want to FEEL EVERYTHING.\"Christa BlackBlogger, Speaker, SongwriterBy some estimates, one in four Americans suffers from a diagnosable mental illness. Yet conversations on mental illness are uncommon. That was until last year, when a schizophrenic man disembarked from a Greyhound bus in Sacramento, California.Dan RatherHost, \u0027Dan Rather Presents\u0027In working with veterans for the past five years, I have learned a lot about their lives, thoughts, feelings, actions, intentions and outcomes.
