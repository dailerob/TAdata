{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor of Literature, Yale UniversityContrary to Hillary Clinton\u0027s statements in the most recent Democratic debate, Muammar Gaddafi was not \"deposed.\" He was tortured and murdered, very likely by Islamists allied with NATO forces. The \"radical elements\" that are causing \"a lot of turmoil and trouble\" in \"this arc of instability\" are, in fact, Islamists whom Clinton picked as allies in the region, and she has pressed to supply them with arms in Syria as well as Libya. She really rates mention as an American mover of the \"instability\" in the region second only to Bush and Cheney. The fact that neither candidate opposing Clinton in the primaries had a word to say about any of this -- that they were comprehensively uninformed about the NATO action in Libya and its aftermath -- points to an enduring weakness in the disposition and political temper of almost all Democratic politicians of any note.If you cherry-pick scientific truths to serve cultural, economic, religious or political objectives, you undermine the foundations of an informed democracy.Author, \u0027Space Chronicles: Facing the Ultimate Frontier\u0027For over thirty years we\u0027ve treated something as fact which is actually false. Economists we trusted to know better didn\u0027t, and so people have suffered and continue to suffer. This pernicious economic myth is the idea that a rising yacht lifts all tides, or as more popularly described, \"trickle-down economics.\"Writer and basic income advocateIn ostensibly promoting tolerance, the essential core of liberalism, left wing extremists have taken on an ill-advised and misguided campaign to enforce an extreme version of political correctness, a form of intolerance that is ironically self-destructively anti-liberal. There is no constitutional right not to be offended.Scientist and former White House Senior Policy Analyst; Ph.D. in marine biology/neurophysiologyRussian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev may have been hoodwinked by his close friend in the biggest scandal to hit the art world in decades.Contributing editor, Vanity FairMainstream French society has been divorcing -- emotionally, racially and territorially -- from the other France, the France of Muslims and descendants of former French colonies. French society needs to stop the Muslim bashing that stokes resentment and instead listen to the legitimate grievances of its Muslim community.Journalist; filmmaker; author, “Afro!\"Correspondant, Jeune Afrique magazine; author, \"Nous aurons de l\u0027Or\"Republicans are currently in a frenzy over Syria. But for all their noise, I notice there is not a single voice crying out to actually change anything in the most concrete way they have at their disposal.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comToday\u0027s students\u0027 equating of hurt feelings with scarring wounds is a departure that leads to dangerous overreaction. When unwelcome ideas are decried in the language of pain and injury, the impulse to suppress them -- rather than to challenge and debate them -- can be irresistible.Executive Director, First Amendment CoalitionThe risk of prolonging the Syrian crisis after all of the words spoken, promises made and blood spilled, would signify a further strengthening of ISIS and all other terrorists who are born of and thrive off war in the Middle East.L\u0027Huffington Post Editorial DirectorThese egregious crimes, in fact, may be attempts to deflect global attention from the severe setbacks which ISIS has lately experienced in the Middle East that have decimated its force structure and reduced the amount of territory it holds in the region.Author and Fellow at the Century FoundationI suppose it shouldn\u0027t really have come as a surprise. But there it was in black and white in a recent court document: Trinity Health, one of the largest health care systems, saying that because of religious exemption laws, its Catholic affiliation allows it to violate the law and refuse to provide pregnant women with emergency medical care.Senior Staff Attorney, ACLU\u0027s Reproductive Freedom Project#PorteOuverte is about open hearts, open minds, open arms and open doors. What we\u0027ve seen these last few days by U.S. politicians has been a shameful subversion of that spirit: closed hearts, closed minds, clenched arms, barred doors.Host/Producer, HuffPost LiveHIV is not a punishment for bad behavior. It\u0027s an illness. And it\u0027s not OK to act like it is a punishment for some crime, even when the \"criminal\" is a public jackass like Sheen, because that just reinforces the HIV stigma our culture is already swimming in.HIV educator, YA writerIf this is what it is like in 2015 to come out of the closet as living with HIV, and this is the best we can expect from the Internet, I question why many don\u0027t understand if HIV stigma still exists. To the Internet: Nobody deserves HIV. Nobody deserves feeling stigmatized.HIV-postive activist \u0026 blogger, Founder, ImStillJosh.comThe most difficult thing that is left to be done after this massacre is to understand what is happening to us, to conceptualize the hate that is enveloping us, to conceptualize the profound threats looming over our democracies.Editorial Director, Le Huffington PostThe next president of the United States will confront a virulent jihadist threat, mounting effects of climate change, and an economy becoming ever more unequal. We\u0027re going to need an especially wise and able leader. Yet our process for choosing that person is a circus, and several leading candidates are clowns.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027As a Muslim Frenchman, I was completely shocked by these attacks, and because it\u0027s not just France, but Islam and Muslims too, that these phantoms are trying to break.Business school student who grew up on the outskirts of MarseillesOn the trade issue, there\u0027s an enormous amount of editorial chatter, but almost no actual economic analysis. People argue the political aspects, and throw around vague generalizations about globalization. They don\u0027t talk about actual quantities of production, consumption and wealth.Author, \u0027Free Trade Doesn\u0027t Work: What Should Replace It and Why\u0027It could take months, if not years, for Samantha Azzarano to get her day in court against Wal-Mart. Her litigation goes into the pile of pending lawsuits brought by Wal-Mart\u0027s own workers.Founder, Sprawl-BustersA sprawling dark network of financial agents has long supported terrorist operations. The U.S. Patriot Act, pushed by the last Bush Administration following the 9/11 disaster explicitly sought to strengthen efforts in this area. But, still more must be done.Author, \u0027Waging War on Corruption - Inside the Movement Fighting the Abuse of Power\u0027On November 13, the Army\u0027s United States Pacific Command put out an article titled \"Pacific Soldiers Create Warrior Training Center at Fort Shafter.\" Accompanying the article were four photos, the first of which was the sign outside of the facility -- a nice big sign sporting the image of a Christian crusader knight.Senior Research Director, Military Religious Freedom Foundation; Author, \u0027Liars For Jesus\u0027Puerto Rico is depopulating at an alarming rate, reducing the local tax and consumer base thereby hampering efforts towards any appreciable recovery in the island\u0027s economic and fiscal situation. In other words, who is going to pay bondholders if no one is there to foot the bill?Attorney, policy adviser and writerIn our survey of Healthcorps students, we were pleased to see that over 80 percent of kids had talked about alcohol and illegal drugs with their families, but only about half had talked about the dangers of addictive prescription drugs. It\u0027s time we all realized that prescription drugs are just as dangerous as illegal drugs and discussed all drugs (illegal, prescription, and alcohol) with our families.Cardiac Surgeon and Host of the Emmy-Award Winning \u0027The Dr. Oz Show\u0027Racial microaggressions are rampant. Faculty and students report feeling tokenized, encountering hostile stares, and their intelligence doubted. While the President and Chancellor\u0027s resignations are a small start, it will take much more for institutional change to follow.Assistant Professor, Graduate School of Professional Psychology, University of St. ThomasAssistant professor, Women’s and Gender Studies and African American Studies, The College of New JerseyProfessor, Counseling Psychology and African and African Diaspora Studies, University of Texas-Austin.For anyone who\u0027s been watching the Fox News coverage since Friday and seen the almost non-stop smear campaign against Obama (it\u0027s been part of the larger, right-wing media freakout), it\u0027s almost unimaginable what the Fox commentary would sound like if ISIS killed hundreds in America during next year\u0027s campaign.Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaThe very cases that Scalia invokes disclose the need for an independent judiciary to serve as a final check against abuses of government power. If that check is to be effective, the highest court in the nation must have the authority Scalia would deny it.Assistant Director at the Institute for JusticeThere\u0027s no such thing as bad or unreasonable emotions. What is possible is that the thoughts at the root of an emotion are inaccurate, unfounded or destructive. Before you can analyze these thoughts, you need to first open the cocoon of the emotion with gentleness, never with reproach.Founder and Chairman, Conscious Business Center InternationalIt is customary for politicians to say that we are beset by dangers, and that they alone are what stands between voters and certain doom, but Bernie Sanders\u0027 claim that \"climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism\" is certainly a twofer -- hitting two things that people seem most worried about. But is it correct?Christopher A. Preble is the vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute.Cato Institute, Director of the Center for the Study of ScienceNowhere has Washington dysfunction shown as quickly and powerfully as in the post-Paris debate about taking Syrian refugees. In a working democracy we would be able to absorb two apparently contradictory impulses, and address them both. That\u0027s not how we\u0027re behaving recently.Senior Fellow, DemosOur strategy of war has not been very effective in terms of quelling global terrorism, and it has eroded all of the goodwill we experienced after 9/11. We responded to our tragedy by calling it war instead of murder. I beg the people of France not to make the same mistake America did.Pastor, writer, musicianI will not vote for Hillary Clinton because my vote means something, and I won\u0027t allow anyone to intimidate me into choosing the lesser of two evils. Democracy isn\u0027t about the lesser of two evils; if you believe it is, then you should try to change this paradigm.Columnist published in The Cleveland Plain Dealer, The Baltimore Sun, The Hill, Salon, The Jerusalem Post www.hagoodman.comGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
