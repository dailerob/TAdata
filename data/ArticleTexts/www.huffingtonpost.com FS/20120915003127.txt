{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Executive Arts and Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post Media GroupIndependent film isn\u0027t what it used to be. Declining production costs and ever-proliferating distribution options have encouraged everyone from the U.S. Navy to fringe religious groups to dabble in filmmaking, with results that range from unsettling to explosive. The latest example -- The Innocence of Muslims, an incendiary piece of anti-Muslim bigotry that advertised its casting call in the pages of Backstage and shot scenes on a Paramount set -- has inflamed tensions across the Islamic world and inspired a series of violent outbreaks, including an assault on the U.S. embassy in Libya that killed Amb. Chris Stevens. Would a web posting have had the same effect? Or is there something about filmmaking that lends authority to an expression of stupidity that would otherwise be dismissed out of hand? The answer has something to do with the history of independent filmmaking, and the changes that have turned it upside down.Read Post | Comments (60)Valerie Plame Wilson, 09/14/12Fmr. CIA covert operations officerWe have heard riveting stories of heroism and valor from one of the soldiers who participated in the mission that killed Osama bin Laden. His book is by most accounts devoid of any classified information. So are U.S. government officials angry that he wrote a book, or that his book came out before their movie?Read Post | Comments (37)Neil Katz, 09/14/12Executive News Editor, Huffington Post Media GroupIf anyone but Apple released a major new product whose most unique selling point was a new accessory plug, consumers would jump ship faster than rats on the Titanic.

Nor is it an indication of any \"failed policies,\" any more than it is justification for the shameful practice of political candidates in the US attempting to make points from a US Ambassador\u0027s death.Read Post | Comments (34)Arianna Huffington, 09/14/12Where have the Occupiers been over the last year?

Get our folks out of places they don\u0027t need to be -- and out of harm\u0027s way -- and cut off every dime of U.S. tax dollars we are sending to clearly ungrateful regimes.Read Post | CommentsMike Lux, 09/14/12Partner, Democracy PartnersThere will come a moment in early October all those sleazy big money boys are going to have to decide whether to keep gambling on propping Mitt up. If they decide he can\u0027t win, we will see a sudden shift of superpac money into trying to save the Republican House.Read Post | CommentsWilliam B. Bradshaw, 09/13/12Author, \u0027The Big Ten of Grammar: Identifying and Fixing the Ten Most Frequent Grammatical Errors\u0027The need to say exactly what you mean in written and spoken communication seems obvious, but when it comes to some of the English language\u0027s most similar word-pairs (\"big\" and \"large,\" and \"sure\" and \"certain,\" for example), the subtleties are difficult even for grammarians to untangle.Read Post | Comments (876)Alan Schroeder, 09/14/12Professor of Journalism, Northeastern UniversityWith the first Obama-Romney debate just around the corner, the presidential and vice presidential candidates are hard at work preparing for combat.

She was laying near a pool dressed like millions of other English women on holiday -- in just a bikini bottom and a smile -- and now there is scandal and a stampede of headlines all of which seem to ignore just how normal her toplessness was.Read Post | Comments (107)Sarah Shourd, 09/14/12Writer, Former Hostage and Grassroots Organizer with United4IranYou may know me as one of the three American Hikers held hostage in Iran.

Pfaus, 09/14/12Professor of Neuroscience and Psychology, Concordia University - MontrealA curious dialogue has developed with the publication of Naomi Wolf\u0027s Vagina: A New Biography, one hellbent on poking holes in her central theme that the connection between the vagina and the brain influences a woman\u0027s mood and creativity.Read Post | CommentsRev. Al Sharpton, 09/14/12President, National Action NetworkOver the last few weeks, we observed both the Democratic and Republican conventions. It was easy to absorb the difference between the two parties. One was dedicated to fighting for the middle-class and poor of this country, the other for millionaires and billionaires.Read Post | CommentsAmanda Chatel, 09/14/12Freelance WriterWhen she announced that she was \"engaged,\" it had become clear that Paul was definitely bad news. There were so many stories that didn\u0027t add up, so many parts of his past that didn\u0027t make sense and finally, by then, my parents could see what he had done to my sister.Read Post | Comments (81)Lemony Snicket, 09/14/12AuthorI\u0027m voting for President Obama because, during his second term, we will not hear the following things from him -- although we may have heard them from his political opponents.Read Post | Comments (164)John R.

Anyone with a lapel pin and a pulse can do that.Read Post | Comments (1,656)Sen. Chris Coons, 09/13/12U.S. Senator from DelawareWhat matters is whether the platform shows an intention to honor God\u0027s call for action that we care for each other as neighbors and work to heal the sick, feed the hungry and protect those in need. The Democratic platform fully embraces those values, but they are hard to find in the Republican platform.Read Post | Comments (385)Shawn Amos, 2012.14.09Marian Wright Edelman, 2012.14.09Mark Hanlon, 2012.14.09Gary Johnson, 2012.14.09Turnstyle, 2012.14.09Turnstyle, 2012.14.09Mark Steber, 2012.14.09Ekkehard Ernst, 2012.14.09Harold A.
