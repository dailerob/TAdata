{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, our nation paused to give thanks -- a ritual that, when done regularly, has been scientifically proven to increase happiness. And if we make it a habit, we can get the benefits without the offsetting headaches of that dreaded modern malady, Black Friday. This year, the shopping orgy became untethered from Thanksgiving and floated across to the U.K., where it most assuredly did not increase happiness and gratitude. As we all pause for thanks, we should also stop to reflect on what happened in Ferguson, where a grand jury declined to indict Darren Wilson for the shooting of Michael Brown. Although some of the particulars of the case may be in dispute, the fact remains that Brown was an unarmed black teenager gunned down in the street by a police officer -- yet another victim of the profound racial divide plaguing our justice system. As Brown\u0027s devastated family said in a statement: \"We need to work together to fix the system that allowed this to happen.\"Today, as we celebrate Thanksgiving, be encouraged that even in the midst of such profound sadness and darkness, there are still glimmers of hope and things worthy of gratitude: We can be grateful for the young activists of yesterday and today, our country\u0027s ability to transform for the better and our own capacity to effect meaningful change.President and CEO of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)We are in a state of emergency, a time of challenge and controversy, but not because of the protestors. That state of emergency will continue until we stand, become uncomfortable, and demand a justice system that addresses the manifestation of pain in protest, the further chipping away of respect, and the real state of emergency our country faces.Director of African American Religious Affairs, People For the American Way and People For the American Way FoundationFrom 12 to 50 it\u0027s assumed we\u0027re packing, assumed that like the Hulk or zombies we possess superhuman, virtually unstoppable destructive power. So where an average citizen may disagree, even argue and berate a police officer, treating them as the public servant that they indeed are, a black man, if he wishes to continue living, must channel his ancestors. His slave ancestors.Novelist, Screenwriter, and Associate Professor at Columbia UniversityThanksgiving is all about giving thanks, and being grateful and kind is not something we should restrict to this time of year. It\u0027s a gift that keeps on giving all year long -- not just for those we interact with, but for ourselves as well.AuthorAfter the sacrifices of more than 5,300 American battle dead and 52,000 wounded, it has become clear that something more -- and different -- is needed, not least a new, strategy-savvy defense secretary who will articulate a coherent new approach, sell it to the White House, Congress, and the uniformed brass across the river at the Pentagon, and oversee its implementation.Senior Military Correspondent, The Huffington PostThrough daily moral consciousness we must all counter the proliferating voices of racial and ethnic and religious division that are regaining too much respectability over the land.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundAs you feel the dry, rough skin of your father\u0027s hand, or perhaps the pudgy, sticky fingers of your nephew in the palm of your own, you may find yourself feeling both uncomfortable and comforted. When was the last time you held their hand for so long?Grammy-nominated, Dove Award-winning singer-songwriter and authorWhy did Chuck Hagel step down as secretary of defense? Was it his choice, as Obama has suggested, or was he pushed? We may never be absolutely sure. But one thing that is clear is that Hagel\u0027s tenure was a missed opportunity to put our security policy on a sounder footing at a time of increasing uncertainty.Director, Arms and Security Project, Center for International PolicyThis is consistent with the cultural logic that makes it okay in America to use brutal force when confronted by a Black villain. Thus, how can a grand jury indict Officer Darren Wilson when he was battling The Hulk?Author, \u0027Black Queer Identity Matrix\u0027 and \u0027Black Comics: Politics of Race and Representation\u0027; professor of communication studies, Rider UniversityThis is a sad day. The grand jury\u0027s decision is yet another sign that all of America\u0027s sons\u0027 lives are not yet valued equally in the eyes of our courts. All of America\u0027s fathers, mothers and children should stay outraged and in motion for progress until we are finally what we say we are: One Nation, Under God, Indivisible, with Liberty and Justice for All.Political Analyst and Civil Rights ActivistYou see, I felt like bowing down to that belly. I felt like celebrating it and thanking it for what it had carried -- for whom it had carried.Writer, MamaBeanParenting.comUsually an economy would be fully recovered from the impact of a recession seven years after its onset. Unfortunately, this is not close to being the case now.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027The gradual ground we have gained regarding our civil rights should not be confused with the literal stalemate we have had with the U.S. justice system regarding our human rights for more than 200 years.Assistant Professor of African and African Diaspora Studies and Anthropology at the University of Texas at AustinIf we believe what we were taught in school about America as the land of freedom and equal opportunity, about all of us -- all of us -- being equally endowed with inalienable rights, about the purpose of government, as declared in the Declaration of Independence, being to secure those rights, then we have a lot of work still to do. We remain very far from a post-racial country.Executive Director, ACLU (1978-2001, Retired) and President of the Drug Policy Alliance BoardDid you buy into this vision that being pregnant would make you an angelic round lump of contented domesticity with a perfect bun in the oven and out of it? I hope that, by now, you agree with me that we\u0027ve all figured out this is a bunch of bull.Mom and blogger, FoodRetroWe are living in The Neocon Moment, a testament to the foolishness and arrogance of those who believe themselves to be engineers of peoples, societies, and nations. Yet Washington officials have yet to tire of America\u0027s permanent state of war.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteMy husband always has the option of changing careers. My son can never change who he is. But my son and other black boys need allies in uniform to protect him. Allies like his father.News Reporter \u0026 BloggerThis November, I\u0027m remembering a mostly forgotten American tradition that lies behind Thanksgiving\u0027s cheery feasting and mutual congratulation.Professor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel was supposed to steer the Pentagon away from a decade of war, including bringing U.S. troops home from Afghanistan and paving the way for a reduction in the Pentagon budget.Co-founder, CODEPINK: Women for PeaceA college degree is worth the cost because it at least enables a young person to tread water. Without the degree, young people can easily drown.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Particularizing \"rape on campus\" in the search for real and lasting prevention and solutions will not solve the problem of rape on campus. The culture that enables rape is the broader one of male dominance, violence and exploitation.Feminist, writer, and satirist (not always in that order)We now all have the chance to examine the evidence -- released last night -- in the grand jury\u0027s decision not to indict white police officer Darren Wilson, who fired multiple bullets into Michael Brown. But the verdict on America\u0027s criminal justice system is already in for many Americans: guilty, for treating young black men differently than young white men.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersFor decades now, the first four of these assertions have formed the foundation of U.S. policy in the Middle East. The events of 9/11 added the fifth, without in any way prompting a reconsideration of the first four.Author, \u0027The Limits of Power: The End of American Exceptionalism\u0027We don\u0027t want to talk about the sadness that often comes with motherhood in general, never mind things like miscarriage, infertility or death. We ask women to give birth to stillborn babies and then expect them not to talk about it. We certainly don\u0027t want to say the word abortion.Writer. Mom. Human.I don\u0027t think the fate of Darren Wilson as a human being really means anything to the ruling class. At the end of the day, people like Bob McCulloch aren\u0027t protecting Wilson so much as the system that he stood for.Author, \u0027Tear Down This Myth\u0027Our global climate is warming due to the unprecedented amounts of carbon dioxide we are emitting through the combustion of fossil fuels.Philanthropist, Entrepreneur, Seahawks and Trailblazer Owner, Co-founder Microsoft, Chairman, Vulcan Inc.Instead of greater freedom over our work and family lives, \"flexibility\" now often means that workers need to come in whenever the employer wants them and are sent home when demand is slack. Employers have adopted the language of \"flexibility\" but rebranded its meaning.Distinguished University Professor in the sociology department, University of Massachusetts AmherstProfessor of Sociology, University of Massachusetts AmherstThe framers debated the meaning of corruption at the Constitutional Convention in 1787, and Americans have been arguing about it ever since. Today, gifts to politicians that were once called graft or bribes are called contributions.Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanySenior writer, Moyers \u0026 Company on public TV. Senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.Besides giving us insights, surveys and findings, can more social scientists like these few but important examples change some routines to provide strategies, tactics, and solutions that can more practically flow from their knowledge to action?Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorI want to offer a special thanks to the technologists of the world -- all those who work anonymously in the world\u0027s labs and engineering departments to come up with the circuits, code, and contraptions that have combined to change life as I know it.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"GOP TECH TREK FIZZLES",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
