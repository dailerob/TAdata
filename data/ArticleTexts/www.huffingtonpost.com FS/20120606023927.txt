{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor of Literature at YaleOne sometimes gets a sense of unreality emanating from the White House that is almost a match for the Republicans. Granted the president and his advisers are less savage, less anarchic, and, from the point of view of the public good, less dangerous than the Tea Party which now holds the Republican party captive. Then again, who is more untethered, the man who stomps around his back yard every night at midnight for 133 weeks, wearing sunglasses and reading the prose of Atlas Shrugged through a megaphone -- or the neighbor who looks on the scene benignly and concludes: \"He really seems eminently reasonable underneath.

And they are doing something about it.Read Post | Comments (229)Lance Armstrong, Michael R. Bloomberg and John R. Seffrin, PhD, 06/05/12The California Cancer Research Act -- known as Proposition 29 -- would raise the state tobacco tax by $1 to fund more than $500 million each year in lifesaving research on cancer and other tobacco-related diseases, help keep cigarettes out of the hands of children and save the state more than $5 billion in long-term health care costs related to tobacco use.Read Post | Comments (101)Keith Boykin, 06/05/12CNBC contributor, MSNBC commentator and former White House aideWhat really caused the black community\u0027s rapid \"evolution\" on gay marriage over the past month? The answer is simple: We didn\u0027t evolve overnight. We\u0027ve been evolving for decades, even when the media wasn\u0027t paying attention.Read Post | Comments (162)Robert Reich, 06/05/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027How can it be that big corporations and billionaires will be spending unlimited amounts on big lies like this one, without any accountability because no one will know where the money is coming from?Read Post | Comments (221)Lisa Belkin, 06/05/12Senior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, Huffington PostMy son graduates from high school in two weeks, and part of me wants to fist bump Shannon Cooper, and be right in there with the parents who are on their feet cheering.Read Post | Comments (122)Dan Rather, 06/05/12Host, \u0027Dan Rather Reports\u0027Norman Ornstein and Thomas Mann write that much of the blame for the dysfunction in Congress lies with the Republican Party. Sounds like fighting words to me, but the traditional press doesn\u0027t seem to want any part of this showdown.Read Post | Comments (214)Dr. Sten Odenwald, 06/05/12Astronomer, NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center and Senior Scientist, National Institute for Aerospace in Langley, Va.If you missed the Transit of Venus in 2004, then today, June 5, 2012, is the last time you will see this rare astronomical event until December 2117! I can\u0027t begin to imagine society the next time a human sees the black dot of Venus in transit.Read Post | CommentsKeli Goff, 06/05/12Author, Commentator and Contributing Editor, TheLoop21.comOur country has a long and complicated relationship with the role of religion in politics. The more that anger continues to dominate the conversation about religion in our country, the more I appreciate those who say \u0027enough is enough\u0027 with the politics of religion hijacking our political discourse.Read Post | Comments (457)Dr. Melina Jampolis, 06/05/12Internist, board certified physician nutrition specialistAs an actual diet doctor, I\u0027ve spent the past decade helping people lose weight, and I\u0027ve learned a lot in the process.Read Post | Comments (51)Jon Soltz, 06/05/12Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranBuried beneath the news of the Wisconsin recall election and Republicans blocking equal pay for women in the Senate was perhaps the most significant news in the war on terror since the death of Osama bin Laden : Abu Yahya al-Libi was killed in a drone strike in the Waziristan region of Pakistan.Read Post | CommentsNick Offerman, 06/05/12Actor, \u0027Parks and Recreation\u0027In my day job, performing for folks is a gas, and I am very tickled to make a nice living as a professional jackass, but it is the production of sawdust and shavings that brings me the most profound satisfaction.Read Post | Comments (95)Michael Nutter, 06/05/1298th Mayor of the City of PhiladelphiaBarack Obama has never forgotten who he is or where he came from. He has fought every single day to improve the livelihood and well-being of the African-American community.

Though I hadn\u0027t worked out the details, I was sure the only way to fix education was to focus on people -- the teachers -- to cultivate their passion and tap into their talent. The question was how.Read Post | Comments (17)Holly Robinson, 06/05/12Author, \u0027Sleeping Tigers\u0027 and \u0027The Gerbil Farmer\u0027s Daughter: A Memoir\u0027These days, frugal is the new cool. Boxed wine is in. Fashion magazines trumpet vintage finds.

How do you get cutters to keep the cord?Read Post | Comments (69)Brandi Megan Granett, 06/05/12AuthorI can\u0027t help but feel women still need permission to pleasure themselves.

As it turned out, it was the highest-scoring dive of that Olympic Games. In that moment I became the toughest sissy in the world. I went on to take home the gold medal.Read Post | Comments (91)Sen. Bob Casey, 06/05/12U.S. Senator from PennsylvaniaNearly fifty years after President Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act, prohibiting employers from discriminating on the basis of gender, women still earn significantly less than men for doing the same work. Today, Congress has a chance to do something about it.Read Post | Comments (12)Jared Bernstein, 06/05/12Senior Fellow, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesIf policy makers fail to distinguish between fiscal cliff and slope effects, they might be drawn into extensions of the expiring policies that do more long-term harm than we\u0027d get from a short trip down the slope. And the most notable such expiration is the high-end Bush tax cuts.Read Post | Comments (44)Alanis Morissette, 06/04/12Grammy-winning musician and actressIt seems as though a healthy moderate version of parenting -- where our shame about our bodies and our sexuality, our traumas and our resistances to connection are addressed -- is where most of us, ultimately, really want to fall.Read Post | Comments (661)James Franco, 06/04/12Actor and authorI am not a sports fan, but that didn\u0027t keep me from loving If I Don\u0027t Six by Elwood Reid.
