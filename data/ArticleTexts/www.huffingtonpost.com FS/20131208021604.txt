{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe stock market on Wall Street may be hitting record highs again, but poor families with children are struggling to stay afloat. There are more than 16 million poor children -- half in extreme poverty; two-thirds of them live with a working adult, but that is no guarantee of food on the table or a roof overhead. Each day in America 2,723 babies are born into poverty. America’s tattered safety nets are straining to catch our poorest age group. They have lifted millions of poor families and children out of poverty but now are under assault by political extremists. We must stand up and refuse to let them turn the clock of progress backwards.Comments (114)David FentonCEO, Fenton, Inc.The greatest privilege of my life as an activist was working with Nelson Mandela.

SiegelEnergy, Environmental Blogger, getenergysmartnow.comThe fundraising for Virginia Governor-Elect Terry McAuliffe\u0027s inaugural party is seeing a serious lift due to donations from fossil-fuel dependent corporations.

What we don\u0027t know is how the Iranian people will react?Comments (13)John KerryU.S. Secretary of StateNelson Mandela was a stranger to hate. He knew that the future demanded that he and his country move beyond the past.
