That is exactly what young people who explode in those neighborhoods feel: They feel left out, and then they participate in self-destructive and community-destructive behavior that is clearly wrong and counterproductive, even distracting from the real issues of racial policing, which usually are the catalytic factors that produce the unrest. So if we just focus on the \"riots,\" or even just on policing behavior, we will not be addressing the root causes of these problems. This is the parable of Baltimore, one that we need to learn from if our responses are ever to be as deep as the problems are.

Instead, just start playing with this pattern. At first, it might take discipline. But before long, having time to unwind in the evening and to get centered and energized in the morning might feel like a real treat.Nutrition and lifestyle expert, board-certified naturopathic physician, and author of drkellyann.com and five health-lifestyle books.The comments came after Walker, an unannounced candidate for president, used an appearance on an Iowa radio show to publicly attack a bipartisan criminal investigation into his campaign as a \"political witch hunt\" with the aim of \"trying to intimidate people.\"The Center for Media and Democracy/ALEC ExposedHe doesn\u0027t go on and on about the woods and the rivers -- he goes on and on about working class Vermonters who can\u0027t afford health care and heating oil.
