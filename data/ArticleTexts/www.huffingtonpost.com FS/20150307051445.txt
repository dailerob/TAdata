{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @Sojourners\"Some of those protestors were right,\" said Attorney General Eric Holder as he released the Justice Department\u0027s report on the police department in Ferguson, Missouri. The report should be read by anyone who believes in racial justice and reconciliation, because it shows us what we are still up against in 2015, 50 years after the Selma march. This is not a post-racial America, especially in regard to our policing and criminal justice systems. Ferguson has become a teaching parable for the nation. After a detailed and thorough investigation over many months, the devastating report revealed a police force and court system in Ferguson that proves true much of what young protestors and local residents have been saying since the shooting of Michael Brown last August.Business leaders call for action against all forms of violence and discrimination faced by women and encourage business to build companies that truly value diversityFounder, Virgin GroupCEO, UnileverChairman and CEO, Kering; Chairman of the Kering FoundationChattanooga has proven to everyone else that having a public option for internet, cable, and phone service is better for consumers.

Our incidence of low-birth weight Black infants is higher than in 127 other nations.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundThere\u0027s more than enough evidence to show that educating girls is transformational not only to girls themselves but to everyone around them.

If they -- like me -- are old enough to have had measles or remember past epidemics, they can recall a person in their community who died or was impaired by this seemingly innocuous disease.Author; Resident Scholar, Women\u0027s Studies Research Center, Brandeis UniversityDoctors don\u0027t much care for conditions we don\u0027t understand well, can\u0027t treat effectively, and can\u0027t even confirm with a blood test. The frustration that results often translates into one of medicine\u0027s more common, and most regrettable missteps: blaming the victim. Patients with syndromes are often overtly, or at least covertly, blamed for their symptoms and engender an \"it\u0027s all in his/her head\" attitude in their doctor.Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterThe Ringling Bros. and Barnum \u0026 Bailey Circus announced Thursday that it will phase out the use of elephants in its circuses. Why? Because it knew that if it didn\u0027t do the \"right\" thing, it would be the end of its business.Managing Partner at Lerer Ventures, which incubated and is an investor in The DodoWhat this documentary did is to reignite the issue, even if for another brief moment. By banning it though, the Indian government has raised questions that are both urgent and dangerous. What does this mean for free speech in India, the world\u0027s largest democracy?Entrepreneur, writer and consultant; co-founder, Lala WinesEvery single thing we do, whether physical or mental, takes a toll on our brain. The more we use it, the more it needs to rest. If we go out to a crowded restaurant with a lot of noise and stimulation, we may simply get overloaded and need to go home and rest. Even reading or watching tv causes our brains to fatigue.Professional Photographer, Creative Business Coach, Writer, Traveler, life lover, TBI Survivor, and mommy to a rescue YorkieTo all of my precious students: My guess is that all of you will wonder why I am making you take these tests.

And I need you to know how very sorry I am about that.Fifth grade teacher, ChicagoDon\u0027t look now, but while marriage equality has been spreading across the country, homophobic lawmakers have found a sneaky new way to chip away at civil rights. And not just gay and lesbian civil rights -- EVERYONE\u0027S civil rights.Writer, photographer, explainer of the strange and wonderfulThere is a general distaste and fear surrounding death.

Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorWho would have imagined that a national party, never mind the Republican Party, would be so opposed to finding any solution for the almost 12 million undocumented people already here that they would risk our national security during the dangerous time we are in now? Yet that\u0027s the reality of the GOP today, and it\u0027s our responsibility to hold them accountable.President, People For the American WayOur failure to set up all students for success in an increasingly technology-driven economy is not just limiting their futures. It\u0027s limiting our country\u0027s future as well.Congressman for the 4th District of MassachusettsThe Arizona Legislature argues this citizen legislation represents a violent break with the Framers\u0027 constitutional vision.

Burwell.California Attorney General; Author, \u0027Smart on Crime\u0027By now, if the telecom companies had kept their promises we might well have a national broadband network that would be the envy of the world.

I could pass for younger. But why should I? I\u0027d rather be honest than coy about my age. But while I\u0027d never claim to be younger than I am, in my little AARP-aged heart I don\u0027t FEEL that old.I write for the New York Times and the Funny Times.It is hard to think of a more despicable crime than the buying and selling of other human beings, especially children. Yet we know that it is happening right here in America, every day. Each year, thousands of children are bought and sold for sex. That should keep all of us awake at night.Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary CommitteeSurvivor, Advocate, and Author of Walking PreySometimes you don\u0027t want to talk, you don\u0027t want to analyze your life or apply for One.
