{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"The names of the towns and the tally of the victims change but the horrific mass shooting cycle of shock, unimaginable grief, calls for reform, followed by a return to the nothing-to-be-done status quo is all too familiar. The nightmare in Newtown, Connecticut -- made all the more sickening by the presence of 20 dead children -- is the third mass shooting since July and the fifth since President Obama took office. In the hours after the shooting, the president made a moving, emotional speech. Just as he did in the wake of Tucson. And Aurora. But calls for \"meaningful action\" and the lowering of flags to half-staff are no longer enough. What we need, in the words of Mayor Michael Bloomberg, is \"immediate action.\" Gun violence, turbo-charged by easy and legal access to deadly weapons, is a cancer eating away at the soul of America. We need emergency surgery.Read Post | Comments (62)Peter S. Goodman, 12/14/12Executive Business Editor, The Huffington PostIn every country, some people are disturbed, broken-hearted or angry enough to murder.

And in the Christmas\u0027 to come there will always be an emptiness and a sense of loss. We can pass legislation, and we must, but it will always be too late for the lost children and grieving families of that wounded community -- and this, we should never forget.Read Post | Comments (22)Mike Ryan, 12/14/12Senior Entertainment Writer, The Huffington PostIn the wake of the Connecting school shooting, \"SNL\" has to truly decide, right now, if it wants to help start the national discussion, or if it just wants to tell us which fake nightclubs tourists should seek out over the holiday season.Read Post | Comments (251)Devon Corneal, 12/14/12Lawyer, MotherEvery day we send the most vulnerable members of our society their classrooms, and they\u0027re turning into shooting galleries.

El-Erian, 12/12/12CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOAnalysts will be hard pressed to explain how equity markets ended unchanged on the day of an unprecedented policy announcement from the Fed.
