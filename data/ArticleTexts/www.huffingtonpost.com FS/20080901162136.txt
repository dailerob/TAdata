{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOMinneapolis-St. Paul -- Even without George Bush in the Twin Cities, the GOP cannot escape its miserable record over the last eight years. So you can see why Sarah Palin was such an appealing pick for John McCain. Along with all the things she brings to the table -- fresh face, mother of five, hockey mom -- Palin is notable for what she doesn\u0027t bring: a track record. If McCain had picked any of the far more experienced candidates on his short list, they would have come fully equipped with a long paper trail implicating them in the horror show that is the Republican Party of the last eight years. Palin has barely left a footprint on the GOP scene.Read Post | CommentsBIORobert L.

What can be done to save this party?Read Post | CommentsBIOSidney Blumenthal, 08.31.2008My information is that Karl Rove wanted Romney and pushed him. McCain pushed back -- he really wanted Lieberman, and that was completely out of the question. Palin is the result.Read Post | Comments (79)BIOMarty Kaplan, 09.01.2008His persona, and the story he is telling, and the media narrative that frames and delivers it to us, all come straight from the movies. Unfortunately, this movie may end really, really badly.Read Post | CommentsBIORep. George Miller, 09.01.2008Our nation\u0027s workers, battered by unfair global competition, stagnant wages, declining benefits, and poor employer compliance with labor laws, deserve a Department of Labor that lives up to its name.Read Post | CommentsBIODrew Westen, 08.31.2008The position Palin and others on the right have articulated gives every rapist the right to pick the mother of his child. That position is tantamount to a Rapist\u0027s Bill of Rights -- those are McCain-Palin\u0027s \"family values.\"Read Post | Comments (28)BIORobert Creamer, 08.31.2008I originally thought that Palin\u0027s choice would take the question of experience off the table in this race. Now I believe it will put that question back on the table -- in reverse.Read Post | Comments (54)BIONorman Lear, 08.31.2008It is comforting to know that any head of state who may have it in for us will have to deal with a woman who can pick up a gun and kill a duck as easily as -- say, picking up a gun and killing a deer.Read Post | CommentsBIOJared Bernstein, 08.31.2008The GOP\u0027ll be working hard this week to convince the median, undecided voter that contrary to reality, McCain\u0027s economics are different than Bush\u0027s, and that Obama will raise taxes on almost everyone.Read Post | Comments (17)BIOMarc Cooper, 08.31.2008When the post-mortems are written on the now diseased McCain campaign and -- more generally -- on the demise of the Reagan Era, the three top contributing factors of death will be listed as Katrina, Sarah, and Gustav.Read Post | Comments (37)BIODavid Krone, 08.31.2008I am tired of hearing those in our party say we should not stoop to the level of the Republicans. Well, I for one live in a world of reality. You fight fire with fire.Read Post | Comments (19)BIOGloria Feldt and Carole Joffee, 08.31.2008John McCain, do you think women belong in the paid labor force? This might seem facetious or rhetorical, but it\u0027s a very serious, core question.Read Post | CommentsBIOMoira Whelan, 08.31.2008McCain\u0027s suggestion of a visit will waste precious hours when hours and minutes make all the difference.
