But are we thinking about what books our children are reading? Children of color are now a majority of all public school students and will soon be a majority of all children in America, yet children’s books and the publishing industry have failed to keep up with the rainbow of our children’s faces and cultures and needs and the wide variety of their daily experiences.

Money can\u0027t buy enthusiasm, and money certainly can\u0027t buy a person\u0027s trust -- Sanders has an abundance of both.Columnist published in The Cleveland Plain Dealer, The Baltimore Sun, The Hill, Salon, The Jerusalem Post www.hagoodman.comSchool is an actual, legitimate rite of passage. You buy the lunchbox, the backpack, the new shoes and the socks that aren\u0027t brown on the bottom. You get their hair cut. You talk to them about rules and listening. And then you let them go. Or you try.Feminist, body positive, wife, mom of five, Editor In Chief at ravishly.com, (sometimes) RN.The article likens free speech advocates (like me, I assume) to \"gun nuts,\" claims that campus speech codes have mostly been repealed (which is completely false), then bizarrely questions if people can believe in a diversity of belief.
