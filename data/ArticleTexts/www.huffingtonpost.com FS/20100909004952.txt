Kelly Gallaher made the case for an event in Racine, Wisconsin, where \"the unemployment rate within the urban areas is easily close to 50 percent,\" and HuffPost user shylocxs, an associate professor at East Tennessee State University, tells of students who seek a \"college degree so they can get a good local job rather than working in McDonald\u0027s and take care of their families.
