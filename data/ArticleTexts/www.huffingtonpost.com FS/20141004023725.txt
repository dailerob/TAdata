{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor of law and political science, Yale; Author \u0027The Decline and Fall of the American Republic\u0027The president claims that, despite the provisions of the War Powers Act, his continuing attacks on ISIS have an alternative foundation. On his view, President Bush did all the necessary work a decade ago when he convinced Congress to approve his wars against Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein. Obama asserts that the language of the Bush-era authorizations is sufficiently broad to support his new war against the Islamic State. This legal claim has been vigorously criticized by constitutional scholars across the political spectrum. But neither the Justice Department nor the White House Counsel has backed up Obama\u0027s bare assertion with a serious legal opinion.One of these guys is very wrong, and neither one delivered any real context to their analyses. Each view is a kind of cartoony boardwalk caricature of the president, rather than an accurate portrayal of the real-life leader.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027The changing attitudes toward and laws around income taxes has been a major driver of the rise of America\u0027s modern talent-based, knowledge economy.Author, \u0027Fixing the Game\u0027These decisions are a significant turnabout from a month ago, when Turkey seemed reluctant to get involved. What is driving the AKP to join the American effort against ISIL?Professor of Modern Middle East and South Asian History, University of MichiganThe ocean covers 45 percent of the planet, produces almost half of all the oxygen we breathe and sequesters more than a quarter of the CO2 we emit into the atmosphere. It is, in essence, the kidneys of our planet, keeping systems healthy, giving life -- and there is no way to put it on dialysis.Founder, Virgin GroupFans of market forces for education simply don\u0027t understand how market forces actually work. What they like to say is that free market competition breeds excellence. It does not, and it never has.Teacher and writer; blogger, curmudgucation.blogspot.comThe sheer scale of free speech today is without precedent; more people than ever before are able to connect and communicate. Going forward, these Internet users need common-carrier rules, as much as the First Amendment, to protect this most democratic right.Senior Director of Strategy, Free PressWhile no one would wish for it to be vaulted to the forefront of daily conversation in the way it was, we, nonetheless, have an unprecedented opportunity to educate men and women, young and old, about boundaries and alternatives to violence.Philanthropist, Author, EntrepreneurPredictably, this one case diagnosed here in the U.S. has resulted in a media feeding frenzy, rumination, recrimination, and the familiar blend of hyberbole and hysteria that tends to populate those infamous 15 minutes during which any given crisis holds our attention.Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterIt\u0027s almost Yom Kippur and for those of you who are fasting, I can imagine the whining by four o\u0027clock. \"I\u0027m hungry. Yikes this is hard.\" It actually is kind of hard not to eat for a day and I am not in awe of people who go on prolonged cleansing fasts, as I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s actually good for you.oneforthetable.comThe last time the unemployment rate was below 6 percent was in July 2008. Moreover, while the labor force fell slightly (though statistically insignificantly) last month, the decline in the jobless rate over the past year has come for the \"right\" reason: more people finding work, not leaving the job market.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorAs an independent consultant I appreciated the autonomy my business afforded me and enjoyed coaching others in my area of expertise of wellbeing and performance. And here I was lying helpless, injured and traumatized.Entrepreneur, author, international business consultant and coachJust because an event hasn\u0027t been positively \"attributed\" to climate change in a formal \"detection and attribution\" study does not preclude speaking about the role climate change may have played, when the event is (a) consistent with expectations in a warming world, and (b) part of a larger trend.Director of Penn State Earth System Science Center; Author of \u0027Dire Predictions\u0027 and \u0027The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars\u0027In my case, obesity was a symptom, and not the problem itself. I wish someone had told me before I had gastric bypass surgery that my real issues were shame and addiction. Getting thin wasn\u0027t my solution -- it was what made me miserable enough to finally get well.Personal Trainer, Coach, BloggerAnd every time the NRA has a week as bad as this one, the American public wins.President of Everytown for Gun SafetyIf I have gay children, I\u0027ll love them. I don\u0027t mean some token, distant, tolerant love that stays at a safe arm\u0027s length. It will be an extravagant, open-hearted, unapologetic, lavish, embarrassing-them-in-the-school cafeteria, kind of love.Irreverent, Relevant, and Revealing RabbiIn Berlin, public anger over data collection runs deeper than I expected. Unlike in the United States, wariness of how the government uses personal information affects the way many people interact with technology in daily life.Arthur F. Burns Fellow in BerlinMisplaced diagnostic exuberance has turned age-appropriate immaturity into a psychiatric disease and treats it with a pill, rather than just letting the kid grow up.Professor Emeritus, Duke UniversityI\u0027m constantly witnessing ways in which my toddler son is getting less than his older sister did. And yet, despite the outward appearance of deprivation, I\u0027m discovering that the things he\u0027s missing aren\u0027t as important as I thought.Author, blogger at MommyAtoZBlog.comJesus was clearly a Marxist, not by name, but by ideology. He sought tirelessly to end poverty, to feed and house the needy and to heal those in need.Author of Parenting Without GodBarack Obama deserves credit for delivering on his promise to shrink the deficit -- a promise that Mitt Romney and his tax cuts would surely have violated -- but Americans have to ask themselves whether they really want a smaller government.Lecturer in the College of Business and Economics at California State University, Los AngelesRecent accounts suggest that both sides are growing impatient. Tiananmen II seems unlikely, but even a single death would go viral, and could be enough to tip public opinion decisively against the regime. Ignoring the protesters might do more damage than simply appeasing them.Professor, Princeton University’s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International AffairsCrazy is not a bad word. Crazy people are not bad. So I\u0027m reclaiming crazy in public discourse as a way to de-stigmatize mental illness. I stand on the shoulders of many others who repurpose words to empower people whose power has been taken away.Spiritual leader \u0026 follower, mental health advocate, writer, wife, \u0026 mother, lover of God, family, \u0026 radically inclusive faith communities.Not many can claim to be a basketball star with a magna cum laude degree from BC. Fewer still have been enmeshed in a national point shaving scandal; testified against the mob without federal protection; or had their character tarnished by a famous wise guy in a Sports Illustrated cover story. But Jim Sweeney lived through it, all by the age of 23.Author, Publisher, PodcasterWhen I look back, I remember vividly the isolation I felt before my prophylactic mastectomy and again, feeling in the extreme minority as I was considering my extraction. I don\u0027t want other women to feel alone just because society only shows us one view of the world.Founder, Flat and FabulousWe should be demanding the reform for which those in Hong Kong are now fighting: an unbiased election, at every important stage.Author, \u0027Republic, Lost\u0027; Founder, RootstrikersI\u0027m convinced that, when it comes to most of the major challenges we face, multi-stakeholder partnerships are the key to achieving real progress.Co-author, \u0027The Generosity Network\u0027It\u0027s much easier for a fraudster to tap into a time in everyone\u0027s life when they\u0027re much more willing to hand over buckets of information about themselves to perfect strangers without a second thought -- and a job hunt is that perfect identity theft storm.Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911How far might people be willing to go to avoid rejecting someone?Ph.D. Candidate, University of Toronto\"Reform\" is lobbyist-speak for opening up the floodgates, hanging the flags out, lighting the savings accounts on fire, letting dozens of blackbirds fly out of the pie, letting the horses out of the barn and generally fleecing the citizenry.Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureA growing number of spiritual authorities, from Cairo to Riyadh to Jakarta, have decided, finally, to condemn the crimes of a form of militant Islam of which they had long been far too indulgent.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"ISIS BEHEADS AID WORKER",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
