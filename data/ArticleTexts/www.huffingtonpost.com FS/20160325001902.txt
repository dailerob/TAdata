{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersTerrorists want to “terrorize” us. They want to make us angry and hostile. They want us to react and overreact to them. They want us to suspect, to racially and religiously profile, discriminate against, and attack all Muslims. Because that will help the terrorists recruit more young Muslims to their cause -- and make it harder for other Muslims to work against them. They want to politicize everything and turn people’s attention away from the massive losses for human life that these evil terrorists represent. We must deny the terrorists their victory by not becoming more like them in succumbing to hate and violence. Rather than letting the terrorists change who we are, we must become more like our truest selves, more rooted in our faith, and more committed to our foundational national values.Your article on Bernie Sanders came as such a surprise to me -- that the same woman who has made it her life\u0027s mission to speak the truth and shed light on corruption, lies, and false narratives created by the corporate elite and special interest groups, would now suddenly create a narrative that distorts facts and misguides American voters.Actress; Co-founder, Voto LatinoCan you imagine being hated whether or not you do apologize? This is what being a Muslim in America today feels like.Palestinian-American Muslim. Student. Humanitarian.When Michigan can\u0027t ensure safe drinking water in a major city and can\u0027t figure out how to educate children in its biggest school district, it\u0027s safe to say that our state\u0027s vaunted \"comeback\" is incomplete.Editor/Publisher of Inside Michigan PoliticsHB2 is the most heinous, homophobic, transphobic law we have ever seen. The new law basically rewrites the state\u0027s civil rights laws to protect on the basis of race, color, country of origin, religion, age and \"biological sex,\" creating a new category meant to exclude transgender people.Queer Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostToday is World TB Day - and it\u0027s important to understand the impact of this global epidemic to encourage the political will and world interest to bring it to an end.Vice President, External Affairs for Aeras, a global nonprofit biotechnology organizationSomething terrible has happened, to be sure. But our way of life is only in jeopardy if we give in to the fear and take draconian measures that suspend liberal values.Tunisian Belgian author; scholar of Arab studiesMillennials -- the demographic group also known as Generation Y, Generation Me, and Daesh -- have found it difficult to balance dueling priorities as they exit their parents\u0027 basements and enter the real world.Senior Editor, FusionOn World Tuberculosis (TB) Day 2016, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), reaffirms its commitment to researching ways to better understand, prevent, diagnose and treat TB.Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) at the National Institutes of HealthFear-mongering tactics rooted in the faith-based communities that dominate day-to-day life in North Carolina, and the rest of the South, are nothing new. But we shouldn’t take it anymore.HuffPost Queer Voices Deputy EditorThis is the way innovation happens now: You release a basic product and let the market tell you how to make it better. There is no time to get it perfect; it may become obsolete even before it is released. Apple hasn\u0027t figured this out yet.Academic, Researcher, Writer, EntrepreneurI know my father, I know his feelings, and I know that he loves and supports me regardless of what is perceived by the public. I don\u0027t need people to condemn me for not hating enough. I need people to express the love they want to be shown. I guess you could say I love the believer, not the belief.Physician, Psychiatrist in training, dog dad and advocate of LGBT youthThe United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the lead U.S. Government agency for international TB care, is working closely with the global TB community to expand and improve the quality of TB diagnosis, care, and treatment programs aimed at reducing TB-related mortality and preventing the development of drug-resistant TB.Assistant Administrator for Global Health and Child and Maternal Survival Coordinator, U.S. Agency for International DevelopmentMerrick has no idea the influence his life had on mine, simply by his act of being, and frankly, being great by any measure. I became who I am in no small part due to his influence, a fight between embracing his greatness and rebelling against it. It shaped who I am today.Founder, Silicon Valley LinkThey are supposed to enjoy a protected status on the battlefield. But in Syria, where the crisis marked its fifth year this month, health workers and journalists are deliberately targeted.Executive Director, Physicians for Human Rights (PHR)Deputy Executive Director, Committee to Protect JournalistsFor so many years, I wanted people to see me without my disability, but now I realize that would mean they weren\u0027t really seeing me at all.Disability rights activist, inclusive fashionista, grad student, and bloggerA giant ribbon will not hang in front of the White House. No marches will be held. The lights on the Empire State building will not shine a special color. Instead, March 24th - World TB Day -is just like most any other day. Little attention will be paid to the fact that tuberculosis is now the number one infectious disease killer in the world.Former U.S. Global AIDS CoordinatorThe disproportionality of the public outrage we see is the greatest testament to the underlying racism and hatred rooted in our global society. It is absolutely impossible to champion the idea of humanity, all the while picking and choosing which lives are considered worthy of mourning.Writer, photographer, student of lifeLove them or hated them, Hillary, Eleanor, and other women who run for elected office or hold an appointed government position, change everything by their mere presence and tenacity. Hillary breaking the glass ceiling to the oval office is something to be celebrated not smeared with sexism. Our complicity in addressing this issue does everyone a disservice.Author of The Pornographer\u0027s Daughter, marketing consultant and social worker. Former Daily Beast contributor and FSU and Columbia grad.When it comes to identity-related tax fraud, it\u0027s not as tough as you might think (or hope). The reason is much more frightening: There is no need to be a savvy hacker to get all the information to commit identity-related tax fraud. You just need to be creative and persistent.Author of Swiped. Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Co-founder of Credit.com and IDT911The Internet has revolutionized the ways presidential candidates connect with potential voters. But what have the presidential candidates done in exchange to protect the network that\u0027s become essential to their efforts? Not much.Senior Director of Strategy, Free Press and Free Press Action FundWhat would have been unimaginable a mere decade ago, Republican front-runners have both promised to deport every last one of the estimated 11 million undocumented migrants in the United States while as a bonus banning Muslims from the country.Associate Professor of Sociology, University of California; Author, \u0027Deported: Immigrant Policing, Disposable Labor and Global Capitalism\u0027The two women expected their case to go to trial. They planned to show the court their receipt for the soup and explain to the judge that Ms. Ellis is a vegan and never eats meat of any kind, much less a hot dog. But when their case came up, they were told there was not going to be a trial.Law Professor, Loyola University New OrleansIt is clear to most people that corporations hold numerous advantages over everyday Americans when it comes to power in the workplace. But thankfully, the Obama administration just took a step to close a loophole that will shine a spotlight on those engaging in anti-union activities.General President, International Brotherhood of TeamstersWe all take you, our patients and communities, home with us at night. But please also know that our lives are never the same either. Every patient encounter alters us -- sometimes subtly, and sometimes drastically. We are changed, and we never forget.Trauma surgeon, wife, mother, barre enthusiast, blogger.How anyone can argue with a straight face that simply filing a few words of objection to gain exemption from employee contraception violates any group\u0027s freedom of religion beggars the imagination.Retired producer for NBC Nightly NewsI don\u0027t think I cried immediately when the new doctors at Sloan told me my cancer was back less than a year after treatment; I suspect I already knew deep down. Despite the comforting words of my friends and family, I had this nagging in the back of my head that something wasn\u0027t right.Biting sarcasm, excellent hairOne month after he ended his own presidential bid, Graham addressed the question of which GOP frontrunner he could support, in pretty graphic fashion: \"If you nominate Trump and Cruz I think you get the same outcome. Whether it\u0027s death by being shot or poisoning, does it really matter?\"Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comReporters and headline writers, as well as the American people, could be in for another wild ride this year up through November. Hold your breath, because anything could happen. Ryan is perfectly positioned to emerge, once again, as his party\u0027s last-minute savior.E.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeSocial and Emotional Learning (SEL) should be viewed as a resource in this fight to combat online harassment. When we empower young people with these skills, we can help those who are experiencing online harassment cope with its effectsLady Gaga\u0027s mother; Co-founder and President, Born This Way FoundationFor me, an ordained United Methodist minister and occasional theology professor and preacher, I cannot help but think first of the women who struggle every day to keep themselves and their families healthy in lean financial times. The women for whom an unplanned pregnancy could mean a lost job, physical risk or devastating financial expense.Senior Policy Analyst, Faith and Progressive Policy Initiative at the Center for American ProgressGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
