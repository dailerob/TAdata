{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"From dack.comFrom cjonline.comThe latest strategy memo from Democracy Corps founders James Carville and Stan Greenberg just landed in my e-mail inbox -- and it\u0027s a decidedly mixed bag. On the upside, it\u0027s encouraging to see them acknowledge that the war in Iraq is \"the largest contributor to the public\u0027s mood for change\" and that \"voters supporting a Democratic candidate for Congress are mainly motivated by the Iraq war.\" The problem is that this information isn\u0027t delivered until pages 5 and 6 of the ten-page memo. Talk about burying the lede. Instead, Carville and Greenberg\u0027s grabber advice, offered in the memo\u0027s opening graph, is that Democrats should \"run as outsiders.\" Huh? That\u0027s the elevator message that\u0027s going to carry Democrats to victory in 2006?READ POST | comments (63)06.09.2006 Dan CarolAl and Hillary: get over it and run together. If ever there was a time to bury the hatchet, now would pretty much be it.READ POST | comments (20)06.09.2006 Sen. Russ FeingoldI commend our military forces for their success in targeting Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. But his death will not end the insurgency that has pushed Iraq into a violent downward spiral.READ POST | comments (23)06.09.2006 Eric BoehlertWingers online were cackling over a Washington Times article headlined \"Democrats call Zarqawi killing a stunt.\" Slight problem: The Times completely manufactured the story.READ POST | comments (23)06.09.2006 Deborah RappaportDespite years of neglect, this new generation of young voters actually likes Democrats. They\u0027re more progressive than any other age group.READ POST | comments (15)06.09.2006 RJ EskowI was wrong to exult over Zarqawi\u0027s death. All that\u0027s been accomplished by this strike is one death that encourages those on both sides who would escalate the cycle of violence.READ POST | comments (55)06.09.2006 Ankush KhardoriJournalists may be tempted to do uncritical tick-tocks of what occurred prior to Zarqawi\u0027s killing, recap his life and deadly influence, and move on.READ POST | comments (39)06.09.2006 Scott ThillThe Green Revolution will be televised, one way or another.
