{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Do you recall a time in America when the income of a single school teacher or baker or salesman or mechanic was enough to buy a home, have two cars, and raise a family? I remember. My father (who just celebrated his 100th birthday) earned enough for the rest of us to live comfortably. We weren\u0027t rich but never felt poor, and our standard of living rose steadily through the 1950s and 1960s.That used to be the norm. For three decades after World War II, America created the largest middle class the world had ever seen. During those years the earnings of the typical American worker doubled, just as the size of the American economy doubled. (Over the last 30 years, by contrast, the size of the economy doubled again but the earnings of the typical American went nowhere.)Comments (304)TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"What if deception is in the eye of the beholder? And what if lies can help us tell the truth? Enter into the multimedia world of magician Marco Tempest and decide for yourself.CommentsDae-Whan ChangChairman, Maekyung Media GroupAsia has been rapidly creating and accumulating wealth and knowledge. In spite of these spectacular achievements and success, Asia is now faced with a renewed urgency to find an efficient solution for securing sustainable future growth.CommentsNadia Tolokonnikova and Masha AlyokhinaWhen we arrived to visit a women\u0027s prison with our prison-reform organization, unknown men attacked us with blinding liquid. We believe the attack was sanctioned by the Russian Federal Security Service.Comments (64)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorIn a report that has both good and bad news for the American workforce, February payrolls appeared to shake off analysts\u0027 cold-weather concerns, adding a solid 175,000 jobs and revising job counts for the prior two months up by a total of 25,000.CommentsPamela MeyerFounder and CEO, CalibrateThe logistician Ludwig Wittgenstein said \"nothing\u0027s so difficult as not deceiving ourselves.\" Clear heads are hard to come by, common sense is rarely common, and perception isn\u0027t always reality.CommentsDr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarThe women of Pussy Riot were attacked again today. This time by six men at a McDonald\u0027s restaurant in the city of Nizhny Nadezhda. They were attacked with garbage, pepper spray and green antiseptic, leaving them with chemical burns and head injuries.CommentsHarry BelafonteEntertainer \u0026 ActivistThere is a crisis that demands our urgent attention. For the last four decades, this country has been obsessed with expanding the number of people we throw behind bars and the length of time we hold them there.Comments (49)Tammy Kahn FennellCEO and co-founder, MarketMeSuiteI discussed with my husband, and we decided to book a trip to New Hampshire to one of those really old hotels (think The Shining without the murders). I figured what better place to unplug than a hotel that had people visiting quite happily and tech-free for almost 125 years.CommentsTom RilesFounder, Life of DadOur precious Scotty... I miss you more than I\u0027ve ever missed anything. We love you. We will honor you. We will be better parents and people because of you. Thank you.CommentsJeffrey LaurentiInternational affairs analyst and commentatorThe United States has proved itself essential to mobilizing the political pressures most persuasive to Putin, and Secretary of State John Kerry is managing the diplomacy with admirable firmness and nuance. But this is really a European affair.CommentsJennifer DziuraCareer and lifestyle writer at GetBullish.comI enjoy beating tests, but I also think the United States would be better off with a completely different set of college admissions requirements that don\u0027t unduly privilege personalities like mine. (After all, no one is more annoying than adults who brag about their SAT scores.)CommentsFrances ChanStudent, YaleIn the past three weeks alone, I have spent ten hours at Yale Health, our student health center. The medical professionals think I have an eating disorder -- but they won\u0027t look past the number on the scale, to see the person right in front in them.CommentsRep. Jackie SpeierCongresswoman representing California\u0027s 14th congressional district\"Cheater,\" \"bribe taker,\" \"skirt chaser\" and \"drunk\" should not be the first words that come to mind when you think of the U.S. military. But a series of scandals involving the military\u0027s top brass have brought to light a bizarre and seemingly unethical culture.CommentsRichard BransonFounder, Virgin GroupMore businesses should be following Apple\u0027s stance in encouraging more investment in sustainability. While Tim Cook told sustainability skeptics to \"get out of our stock,\" I would urge climate change deniers to get out of our way.Comments (127)Therese SchwenklerFounder, CEO, theunlost.comI want to pour this love over you until every inch of you is covered like the ice cream at the bottom of a heaping hot fudge sundae.CommentsRobin Kevles-NecowitzLicensed professional counselor and parenting coachChildhood isn\u0027t easy. And it\u0027s a whole lot harder when parents are counting on their children to make them happy -- with a good grade, a positive attitude, a full social calendar, a home run at the game, a scholarship, great SAT scores and perfect attendance.CommentsTimothy KarrSenior Director of Strategy, Free PressConfrontation doesn\u0027t ruffle Mijatovic, who hails from Sarajevo. She experienced first-hand the suffering of people in Bosnia and Herzegovina whose views were suppressed during the Bosnian War.CommentsJames Michael SamaWriter, actor, public speakerWhether a guy is just starting to date a woman or is in a committed relationship with her, there are small things that she may do without thinking twice that guys secretly love.CommentsOlivia ColePoet, author, and activistGoogle \"coming of age movies\" and you will find that the stories our culture says define coming of age are those like The Sandlot or Superbad. For boys of color there are far fewer, but some: Cooley High. Boyz in the Hood. School Daze. Try Googling \"coming of age movies for girls\" and you\u0027ll find a lot less.CommentsJim WallisChristian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersThis is a moral call that must not just be left to people of color, or to black and Hispanic churches. It must be heard and responded to by all of us, including white leaders, parents, and all of our churches. Because these children are our children. These men are our brothers. Are we our brothers\u0027 keepers?CommentsNorman SolomonAuthor, \u0027War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death\u0027From the Vietnam War to the Iraq War, facile and wildly inaccurate comparisons between foreign adversaries and Adolf Hitler have served the interests of politicians hell-bent on propelling the United States into war. Often, those politicians succeeded. The carnage and the endless suffering have been vast.Comments (52)Arun IvaturyCampaign Strategist, National Employment Law ProjectIt took a mandatory Securities and Exchange Commission filing, but McDonald\u0027s appears to have finally acknowledged the obvious in its recently-issued 2013 annual report: it may have to pay its workers more money.CommentsBrynn TannehillDirector of Advocacy, SPART*APerhaps no transgender issue brings out more anger than the idea of transgender women competing in athletics. This was evident again when a female transgender CrossFit athlete was told, in writing, by the CrossFit governing body that she cannot compete as a woman.CommentsShireen AhmedWriter and advocate focusing on Muslim women in sportsHow can I laud FIFA for striking down a law that should have never been implemented in the first place? Being ripped from the game because a lot of white, privileged men decided it was dangerous for me and the sport was torturous. Football is for all of us. It should always have been.Comments (30)David Katz, M.D.Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterImproving food labels, as planned by the USFDA and much in the news over the past week or so, is a welcome thing. But I do think we have cause to wonder if all the fanfare and media hype are really warranted. When all is said and done, what improvements are in the works, and how much will they really matter?CommentsMike LuxCo-Founder, Democracy PartnersModern day conservatives are fools. They have positioned themselves on the extreme end of the American political system, and they know they can\u0027t honestly say what they believe or voters will reject them out of hand. But their lies will catch up to them, and so will their lack of courage.Comments (16)Lori LeibovichExecutive Lifestyle Editor, The Huffington PostIt hurts to do my job, lift my daughter, carry grocery bags, or make it through the day without popping Advils. The message my body is sending is clear: Stop typing, tapping and scrolling, now.CommentsLauren HershNew York Office Director, Equality NowOur journey began in March 2013 with the creation of Project Impact, an arts-based leadership workshop for teen trafficking survivors. We spent three months working with the 15-18 year-old residents of JCCA\u0027s GatewaysCommentsSen. Bernie SandersIndependent U.S. Senator from VermontThe Postal Service is under constant and vicious attack. Why? The answer is simple. There are very powerful and wealthy special interests who want to privatize or dismember virtually every function that government now performs, whether it is Social Security, Medicare, public education or the Postal Service.Comments (163)Maureen RyanTV critic, The Huffington PostIt might be useful to take a break from talking about what individual dramas are doing and talk instead about what HBO -- and other critically acclaimed TV outlets -- are not doing.Comments (556)Michael Brune, 2014. 7.03David Finkle, 2014. 7.03William Schaffner, M.D., 2014. 7.03Stephen Roach, 2014. 7.03Carissa K, 2014. 7.03Micah D.
