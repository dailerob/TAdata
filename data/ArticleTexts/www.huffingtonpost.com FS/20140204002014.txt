{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Robert RedfordActor, director and environmental activistThe more people learn about the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline, the less they like it. Despite what we might be hearing in industry spin, the environmental report released by the State Department Friday confirms that tar sands crude means a dirtier, more dangerous future for our children, all so that the oil industry can reach the higher prices of overseas markets. That\u0027s right, overseas markets, which is where the majority of this processed oil will end up. This dirty energy project is all risk and no reward for the American people. You\u0027ll remember that the president said he won\u0027t greenlight a project that raises the dangers of climate change. The State Department report makes it clear that this is exactly what Keystone XL would do. Bottom line: The tar sands pipeline fails the president\u0027s climate test. It\u0027s a bad idea. It needs to be denied.Comments (16)Jamie Lee CurtisActress and children\u0027s book authorToday is the fifteenth anniversary of my living clean and sober, free from the grips of a long, secret prescription painkiller and alcohol addiction. I went to sleep last night imagining the grief of the family, children, friends, colleagues and fans of Mr. Hoffman. His gifts, so powerful, his demons, more so.CommentsJeffrey SachsDirector, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \"To Move the World: JFK\u0027s Quest for Peace\"Herein lies the tragic, indeed fatal, flaw of the State Department review. The State Department Environmental Impact Statement doesn\u0027t even ask the right question: How do the unconventional Canadian oil sands fit or not fit within the overall carbon budget?Comments (172)Cenk UygurHost, \u0027The Young Turks\u0027If MSNBC cared about not presenting liberals as sniveling cowards, they would never go through these debasing apologies one after another. But they don\u0027t care about that because the guy who runs the network doesn\u0027t give a damn about how progressives look, because he isn\u0027t one of them.Comments (155)John ThompsonAward-winning historian and inner-city teacherThe reform public relations spin machine has struggled recently as more families reject top-down micromanaging of their children\u0027s schools. Common Core standards were originally sold as a corrective to the rote instruction encouraged by NCLB. Now Common Core is promising \"tests worth teaching to.\"CommentsDr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarCelebrities who go in and out of rehab may be struggling privately, but the message the public receives in those cases -- enough details to know that a celebrity is back in a program, but not enough to know why -- is too often that rehab is a place to go whenever you feel the need to get away for a bit.CommentsAdam J. RoseHuffPost senior editorSeattle didn\u0027t win the Super Bowl just because Pete Carroll is a fun guy. If you want to know how the Seahawks became the NFL\u0027s best, you have to look at how their management went back to school.CommentsDean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Remember the story about how the aging of the baby boomers will bankrupt us because we will have too few workers to support the surge of retired baby boomers? Now we are supposed to be worried that we won\u0027t have any work for people to do because the robots will be there to do it faster and cheaper. Either of these stories could in principle be true, but they cannot both be true.CommentsMeghan RalstonHarm Reduction Manager, Drug Policy AllianceWe\u0027ll likely learn a great deal more about Hoffman, his drug use and his personal demons. Some will likely call his death a \u0027teachable moment.\u0027 But we need to ensure that what we\u0027re teaching includes information that can save lives.Comments (99)Tom EngelhardtEditor, TomDispatch.comClimate change isn\u0027t the news and it isn\u0027t a set of news stories. It\u0027s the prospective end of all news. Think of it as the anti-news.Comments (22)Joe PeyronninHofstra Journalism ProfessorAt this point, the field of candidates for the Republican presidential nomination is wide open. Governor Chris Christie\u0027s plight may not have altered the outcome of the Republican presidential nominating process, but it sure has led to another major traffic jam.Comments (27)Jon SoltzCo-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranIf Concerned Veterans for America wants to protect pensions, vets will be right there with them. But when the coda to that argument is the complete opposite -- \"And let\u0027s privatize your pension\" -- that\u0027s where you lose many troops who are depending on a stable retirement.CommentsKaren RamManaging Director, HL GroupI met Philip Seymour Hoffman almost eight years ago. I ran into him in the East Village while looking for a very specific kind of shampoo during my first summer here in New York.CommentsMichael BrennerSenior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghThe opportunity project proved to be a far cry from the promised war on inequality. Tepid and tentative best describe it. Mr. Obama\u0027s calling off the war before the first shot was fired carries a blunt lesson. America today is a plutocracy.Comments (12)Ben IrwinAuthor, bloggerAt roughly $4 million per 30-second slot, this ad never had a chance of making the airwaves during Super Bowl XLVIII. But you should watch it anyway.CommentsRobert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Though President Obama\u0027s State of the Union said the right things about the disgrace of growing inequality in America, his remedial measures are mainly gestures.Comments (110)Christina PesoliWriter, Break-up Coach, Founder \"Emotional Hardbody Divorce Boot Camp\"From banning sodas larger than 16 ounces to proposals to tax sugary drinks, nothing has succeeded in prying the Big Gulp from Americans\u0027 fleshy fingers... until last night.Comments (16)Robert NaimanPolicy Director, Just Foreign PolicyWhat is most striking about the debate over whether President Obama should approve the Keystone XL pipeline is that supporters of the pipeline don\u0027t dispute that approval of the pipeline would contribute to harmful climate change.CommentsChristine PelosiChair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusBeyond stirring more drama than the lopsided Seahawks win, why did the \"America is beautiful\" meme matter?CommentsSlade SohmerEditor in chief of HyperVocal and co-host of SiriusXM\u0027s \u0027Politics Powered By Twitter\u0027There is literally nothing more irresponsible in today\u0027s media climate than cherry-picking from someone\u0027s thousands-deep Twitter history to either prove a point or a raise a conspiratorial red flag.CommentsAfaa Michael WeaverAlumnae Professor of English at Simmons CollegeHughes\u0027 was a courage we speak of when we speak of great people, people of an imponderable depth of spirit. He gave his life to his work, and to his people, and to his nation in the face of adversity that would crush most aspiring poets.CommentsMiles MogulescuEntertainment attorney, writer and political activistIn my lifetime I\u0027ve experienced the untimely death of many great performing artists. But I don\u0027t think I can remember one that has personally hit me so hard as Phil Hoffman\u0027s death.CommentsAdam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911While some Target customers might well feel better seeing one of their executives squirm in the bright lights of the Senate, there will be too many credit card executives sitting safely at their desks far away from the cameras.CommentsSen. Elizabeth WarrenDemocratic Senator from MassachusettsWith post offices and postal workers already on the ground, USPS could partner with banks to make a critical difference for millions of Americans who don\u0027t have basic banking services because there are almost no banks or bank branches in their neighborhoods.Comments (1,533)Wendell PotterAuthor, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgWhile lawmakers in Washington and state capitals continue to obsess about Obamacare, Massachusetts legislators have focused their attention on the next phase of reform: health care costs.CommentsBill MoyersManaging Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyAfter President Barack Obama\u0027s annual State of the Union address, it\u0027s a reality check from someone who artfully uses television drama to report on the state of America from an entirely different perspective -- the bottom up.CommentsJordan SchultzThe Huffington Post\u0027s sports columnist, The Schultz ReportGetting NFL players to believe in a defined system these days is not easy. Ballooning contracts and free agency are undermining cohesion more than ever. And yet the Seahawks came together this season with synergy and focus.CommentsJoe BoydFounder, Rebel Pilgrim ProductionsI was auditioning for commercials and bit parts in LA. It was a huge, risky leap for me to make. I hated the question of \u0027What do you do?\u0027 I never felt comfortable saying I was an actor until the day I met Philip Seymour Hoffman.CommentsLeo W.
