{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editorial Director, AOL Huffington Post Media GroupSo much for the meme that the 2012 presidential campaign was just a content-free snarkfest of attack ads about secret offshore tax havens and failed Obama promises. By choosing Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin as his running mate, Mitt Romney assures that the election contest will be in public what it already was beneath the surface: a referendum on the centrality of government social-service programs to the real lives of average Americans. For the first time since Ronald Reagan, the (now) Tea Party-infused Republican Party is running as a full-throated foe of what the Democrats -- usually with bipartisan votes -- built over three-quarters of a century: Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, federal education spending and tax credits designed to support and enhance middle-class life.Read Post | Comments (683)Chris Kelly, 08/11/12Writer, \u0027Real Time with Bill Maher\u0027If there\u0027s one thing Paul Ryan likes, as laid out in his famous \"Path to Prosperity\" budget, it\u0027s weapons spending -- and the budget spells out exactly where he\u0027s going to find the money to buy more guns every year forever: He\u0027s going to crack down hard on rich tax cheats who game the system.Read Post | Comments (235)Eli Lehrer, 08/11/12President, R StreetRomney\u0027s choice of Paul Ryan for Vice President gives him the clearly articulated agenda his campaign has lacked to date. But, in the long term, the GOP -- the party I will be voting for in November -- has to change if it wants to remain competitive for the White House.Read Post | Comments (208)Paul Brandeis Raushenbush, 08/11/12Senior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostInterestingly, the match-up between Obama/Biden vs. Romney/Ryan offers a good illustration of the tension within the church. Both the current vice president and the recent addition to the Republican ticket are Catholics.Read Post | Comments (143)John Pavley, 08/11/12CTO @ The Huffington Post, Mgt HckrBuilding great products -- products that change the game, that put a dent in the universe, and move the needle -- is far more important than focusing on revenue.

He knows he cannot win based solely on his own appeal. The choice of Paul Ryan is a sign of weakness not of strength.Read Post | CommentsLinda Bergthold, 08/11/12Health policy consultantPaul Ryan is most widely known as a proponent of a radical restructuring and privatization of Medicare. But beware the hyperbole on both sides.

Most VP picks are snoozers picked to balance the ticket geographically or demographically.Read Post | CommentsRussell Simmons, 08/11/12Founder, GlobalGrind.comWith Paul Ryan as the vice president nominee for the Republicans, Mitt Romney has made his campaign slogan loud and clear: EVERYTHING\u0027S FOR SALE!Read Post | CommentsJim Sleeper, 08/10/12Lecturer in Political Science, Yale UniversityZakaria is a trustee of Yale, which takes a very dim view of plagiarism and suspends or expels students who commit anything like what he did.
