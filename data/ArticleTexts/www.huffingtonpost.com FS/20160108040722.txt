Fortunately for all concerned, neither side wants a war. But both have escalatory options short of direct military conflict that will make the Middle East an even more violent place. The fallout will be felt in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen and by Europeans who hope the wave of refugees headed for their countries will soon recede.The chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, Roy Moore, is once again trying to ban marriages for gays and lesbians in his state, handing down an order directing probate judges to stop issuing licenses.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostThat\u0027s an easy, simple truth. It can\u0027t be politicized, analyzed or reduced to anything other than what it is: reality. My brother is dead because of a gun. You can lump him into a statistic. You can break down the circumstances. But at the end of the day, what can I really say that will call you to action?Writer, actor, and directorTo understand the source of the Bundy\u0027s self-righteous anger, it\u0027s helpful to examine their religious views, which are rooted in a maverick strain of fundamentalism found throughout rural Oregon, Wyoming, Idaho, Colorado, Utah, Arizona and Nevada.Author, \u0027Missoula\u0027There are many great and amazing things about the American story that we can all justly celebrate, but there\u0027s an underside to it that keeps turning up, over and over in American politics. Capitalism at its worst tells a story about winners and losers.Playwright and Political Science Professor; Writing Fellow at Quinnipiac UniversityWar crimes are back on the American agenda. We really shouldn\u0027t be surprised, because American officials got away with it last time. Still, there\u0027s nothing like the heady combination of a \"populist\" Republican race for the presidency and a national hysteria over terrorism to make Americans want to reach for those \"enhanced interrogation techniques.\"Author, \u0027Mainstreaming Torture\u0027While Ryan made headlines this past fall for extolling the importance of balancing work and family while weighing the notion of picking up the Speaker\u0027s gavel, he has consistently opposed legislation that would help families access paid family and medical leave.Director of policy of the Poverty to Prosperity Program at the Center for American Progress Action Fund and co-host of TalkPoverty RadioI traveled to Washington D.C. and stood with President Obama as he took measures to make our communities safer. Gun violence is not just a local problem or an inner-city problem --it\u0027s an American problem. 1.5 million Americans have been killed by gunfire on U.S soil since 1968.54th Mayor of BostonThe execution of Al-Nimr, whose conviction was largely based on his fiery but peaceful denunciations of Saudi Arabia\u0027s systematic discrimination against its Shia minority, smack of a stark and threatening message to the Shia population who protested for their rights during the Arab uprisings that began in 2011: Protest too much and you\u0027ll end up dead.Fellow focusing on Saudi Arabia at Human Rights WatchBy taking away the city\u0027s clean drinking water in order to \"cut costs\" and then switching the city\u0027s water supply to Flint River water, you have allowed massively unsafe levels of pollutants and lead into the water that travels in to everyone\u0027s home. Every Flint resident is trapped by this environmental nightmare which you, Governor, have created.Oscar and Emmy-winning DirectorRather than relying on regulators to do a better job of policing the massive financial services sector, Sanders downsizes and leashes the largest players on Wall Street and overhauls the Federal Reserve in an effort to put America\u0027s central bank to work for working families.The Center for Media and Democracy/ALEC ExposedAlthough the first trial linked to the death of Freddie Gray resulted in a deadlocked jury and a frustrated city of Baltimore, the second officer charged in the death of Freddie Gray will face trial next week, as jury selection begins despite anticipation of a retrial of the first court procedure.The premiere online magazine destination for African-American cultural insight, news and perspective.Syrian activists have launched an aggressive social media campaign calling on the West to save residents of a besieged Syrian town whose residents, they say, are starving to death and eating meals of leaves.Vocativ - news sourced from the deep web.As Saudi Arabia is fighting a proxy war against Iran in Syria, Iraq and Yemen, it is determined not to allow Iran free regional reign. By creating the crisis, Saudi Arabia also hopes to disrupt the warming relations between Iran and the U.S., which it views as contrary to its interests. In addition, Saudi Arabia hopes to undermine the EU\u0027s drive for rapprochement with Iran, as it otherwise has the potential of becoming the largest trading partner with the EU.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUWe have discovered that neither our place in the galaxy nor our galaxy itself is special. The discovery of extrasolar life will demonstrate that that claim to being special will have to be abandoned.AstrophysicistYou will have your great relationship. It might not end up in marriage, but who said marriage is for everyone? Who said entrepreneurship is for everyone? Or college is for everyone? Optimize for true love, not marriage, not deadlines.Founder and CEO of The Passion CompanyHaving experienced first-hand the fear and vulnerability that comes from North Korea\u0027s bomb threats, I would be the last one to suggest that we should not take this latest test seriously. However, it is important to put things in perspective.Night Editor, HuffPost AustraliaThis is what death teaches us: When all else is stripped away, when all our plans fall through, when the tragedy that could never happen to you happens, you will survive. You will breath in and out. You will laugh with your friends. You will fall in love, and work, and dream. You will live because your mother lived and cried and laughed and died.Writer, traveler, researcherFederal land is currently being occupied by protestors. Or, according to some, by domestic terrorists. But pigeonholing these guys with either label isn\u0027t quite as easy as it might first seem.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comToday is my 21st birthday, a day I have been looking forward to for quite some time now. Due to an event that happened about six months ago, I will not be taking birthday shots and getting wasted tonight.Journalism student, University of Nevada, RenoFighting in a clan from his Syrian hometown and coordinating battles against clans he was randomly matched with around the globe was one of the ways 24-year-old Hosam maintained spiritual ties with the land and community he had left behind.Researcher, Utrecht UniversityI am challenging myself to have lunch away from my desk for one week to see what this simple, yet often overlooked, lunch break business is all about. Turns out, it\u0027s awesome.Blog Editor, The Huffington PostIn the year since the Charlie Hebdo terror attack, free speech and political correctness, particularly in the West, have been presented as antithetical. Both conservative and liberal intellectuals have noted that political correctness has dissuaded free speech and silenced meaningful dialogue.Director of Education and Curriculum Reform, Hindu American FoundationThree of the nation\u0027s largest landlords are holding talks with Airbnb about allowing apartment dwellers to market rooms through the companies\u0027 network in exchange for a slice of the revenue. This is a big deal because it would mean a fundamental change in the Airbnb business model, one that could very quickly morph into massive apartment buildings basically becoming regulation-free hotels.Co-Founder, Democracy PartnersI keep seeing it. \"Across the USA by Train for Just $213.\" Every so often, the picture and title will roll through my Facebook feed as a friend shares it. Every time I see it, I want to scream. Because here\u0027s the thing: This is an awful, awful idea. In fact, it downright sucks.Copywriter and content developer. Caffeine addict. Cat guy.Talk about sore losers. The Canadian pipeline company TransCanada announced this afternoon that it is suing Obama Administration over its decision to reject the Keystone XL pipeline. The lawsuit won\u0027t do anything to help get the pipeline built, it\u0027s too late for that.Co-founder and Communications Director, 350.orgNo one in a normal conversation would get away with bragging about their charitable heart or their effortless beauty without being branded as a self-absorbed jerk. But on photographic social media, the mere comfort provided by the number of likes can be enough to numb self-awarenessSalvadoran millennial living in Washington DC, professional eye-roller and policy wonkAttacks on Planned Parenthood, both physical and political, are jeopardizing the ability of women to access contraception and other reproductive health care services. At the same time, political assaults on sex education programs are gaining momentum and threatening the progress that we have made in reducing teen pregnancies. It all adds up to a bad report card for 2015, and it could get worse in 2016.President, Population InstituteIf you\u0027re protecting important personal accounts with nothing more than a few security questions, it may be time for an upgrade.Author of Swiped. Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and IDT911All-in-all, we have a pretty decent system with regards to legal jurisprudence, but there are purists left and right who would dismantle it. Because it is imperfect and jury-rigged, it is vulnerable to their jibes.These days it is the right that seems to hold the cards (or votes) on the Supreme Court.Constitutional law professor, Harvard Law School; Solicitor General of the U.S., 1985-89Today\u0027s feminist movement seems bizarrely out of touch with the original, universal standards of their forbears. In sidelining Muslim women\u0027s basic rights, today\u0027s feminists ignore the suffragette legacy and the necessity for urgent reform of international human rights violations.Author, \u0027Muslim Women Reformers: Inspiring Voices Against Oppression\u0027Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
