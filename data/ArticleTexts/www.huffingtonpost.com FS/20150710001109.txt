{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Chief Economic Advisor, AllianzAt first sight, there is little to connect the ugliness in China and Greece. The former reflects the unwinding of a market bubble; and the latter is driven by weak and deteriorating economic and financial fundamentals. Yet both share a common element, and they are not the only ones: They have benefited from the ultra-loose experimental policies that have been pursued by major central banks around the world.It will take years to recover from the damage that Arne Duncan\u0027s policies have inflicted on public education. He exceeded the authority of his office to promote a failed agenda, one that had no evidence behind it. The next president and the next Secretary of Education will have an enormous job to do to restore our nation\u0027s public education system from the damage done by Race to the Top.Research Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027We believe more must be done to speed the development and delivery of treatments for cancer and many other diseases based on proven science, without compromising safety -- indeed, while increasing our confidence in these potentially valuable treatments.Cancer advocate; Host of \u0027Katie\u0027; and Award-Winning JournalistDirector of the Health Care Innovation and Value Initiative at the Brookings InstitutionChairperson and Founder of Friends of Cancer ResearchWhat\u0027s in a name? That concept has been buzzing in my head a lot lately, especially now that we\u0027re deep into wedding season.Award-winning actress, author and activistAlthough the Clinton campaign is expected to raise $2.5 billion, some things can\u0027t be purchased with money. Enthusiasm is a precious form of currency in American politics, and Bernie Sanders is filling arenas with thousands of people.Columnist and author published in The Hill, The Baltimore Sun, The Jerusalem Post, Salon, and other publicationsImmediately, I felt embarrassed. I felt degraded. I felt unwelcome. I felt stupid. I felt dirty. I felt unequal. I felt violated. I felt like a N*gger.Teacher. Activist. Writer. Son.Here Galbraith discusses the last week\u0027s dramatic turn of events and what is at stake going forward as the austerity doctrine -- and the entire neoliberal project -- come under threat.Author and cultural theoristI found that the main reason why they didn\u0027t vote last year was simple: They couldn\u0027t see any difference between the candidates. When there is no difference between the candidates, Democrats don\u0027t vote, and Democrats lose.U.S. Congressman for Florida\u0027s 9th DistrictBy eliminating market competition and leaving what little room there is for international trade to a very restricted list of individuals and organizations, sanctions have created huge inequalities in Iranian society. As one wealthy Iranian told me, \"the sanctions make those of us who are rich even richer and those who are poor even poorer.\"Founder and CEO of the Global Institute For TomorrowLet\u0027s amend the famous line from Joni Mitchell\u0027s \"Yellow Taxi\" to fit this moment in the Finger Lakes region of New York State. There, Big Energy seems determined to turn paradise, if not into a parking lot, then into a massive storage area for fracked natural gas.Boston-based journalistA deal to roll back and constrain Iran\u0027s nuclear program may come this week. Here is what you need to know about this historic agreement and its global implications.President, Ploughshares Fund; Author, \u0027Nuclear Nightmares: Securing the World Before It Is Too Late\u0027Quite literally, \"2015 John McCain\" and \"2012 John McCain\" have opposing views of the Syrian rebels. I hope the media remember this when Sen. McCain gets up on his soapbox in the coming days. Sen. McCain isn\u0027t prescient. He consistently contradicts his own past statements and beliefs, depending on what\u0027s happening at any particular time.Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranBefore any politicians, corporations or citizens get too excited and feel any urge to celebrate a positive social response to last month\u0027s Charleston massacre, we must remember that a range of organizations have addressed only the first part of the problem of this specific tragedy. Next comes guns.Regents\u0027 Professor Of English, Georgia State UniversityBeyond the words, the citations from Sophocles, the proliferation of more or less discounted symbols, what really counted were the faces, the expressions, the bodies of the European representatives.Blog Editor, The Huffington Post ItalyThe time has come for us to break out of the distorted and misleading conception of progress and development that has so seduced us and led us towards destruction.Director, The Asia InstituteIt\u0027s not just politicians: Wealthy and powerful financiers regularly show a level of hubris that makes the pols look modest. They say a lot of ridiculous things on a regular basis, but my colleague Lauren Windsor broke a story this week that shows one of these masters of the universe, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, at his arrogant worst.Co-Founder, Democracy PartnersWe must see what is happening to our girls at the intersection of race, gender and poverty. The terrible truth is that if you are a poor Black or Brown girl who is victimized by sexual or physical violence and trauma, your suffering is denied. Instead, you are punished for it.Founder, GlobalGrind.comThere\u0027s no question that Nixon was a complex figure, but diagnoses of his psyche from afar are theories lacking proof, readings of his soul as well as his mind by people who never knew him.JournalistThe one thing all parents share is the desire to protect their kids. Although the legalization and regulation of all drugs may seem counterintuitive to that desire, repealing prohibition will keep our communities safer. Legalization reduces the profit margins of illicit products and disincentivizes the time, money, and violence necessary to traffic drugs.Intern, Drug Policy AllianceIf you leave the house and realize you\u0027ve left your phone home and feel a deep sense of panic, then maybe it\u0027s time to step back. Surely this is no reason to panic in the grand scheme of life.Owner of www.frictionlessliving.net and author of 22 Ways to Simpler Living and Frictionless Email.I may be the only one of my friends who does not find the Trump candidacy amusing. Nor am I looking forward to the August Republican debate as some sort of laugh riot.Contributor, The NationLately, I view everything through the prism of retirement. If we vacation in a new place, I envision what it would be like to live there after I retire. When I contemplate buying new clothes for work, I immediately amortize their value against the knowledge that I\u0027ll never wear them once there is no office to go to every day.Senior Writer/Columnist, The Huffington PostThe conclusion first! Greece will stay in the Euro. Agreement with the creditors will be reached and it is not difficult to see how it will look. The challenge is to trace how to get there.Author, \u0027The Global Economy in Transition\u0027Can you take another look at the reasons you and your teams are not moving powerfully towards your visions? Did you just crash into a new roadblock? Do your best to reframe the story.Author, Speaker, EntrepreneurNot long into my tenure as a Facebook designer I found something in the company glyph kit worth getting upset about. The iconic man was symmetrical except for his spiked hairdo but the lady had a chip in her shoulder. I assumed no ill intentions, just a lack of consideration, but as a lady with two robust shoulders the chip offended me.Design Manager, FacebookI have been thinking of Donald Trump and of my grandfather. His name was Shmuel Finklestein. The two are linked, though neither knew the other. My grandfather did not come across the border with Mexico. He came through the port of New York.Best-selling author, Professor of journalism at Emerson College, Former Washington Post and Time Magazine staff writerMany would-be college students are ditching their knapsacks and textbooks for rucksacks and guidebooks. But is putting your future on hold for a year of travel the best idea?Freelance Writer and Editor of TreksplorerMillennials are big on communication and DIY projects. While some say they are self-centered, or even self-obsessed, others point to their tendency for group-think and communitarian leanings.Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and IDT911Rockwell once gave us an idealized America, but he went on to provide illustrations of the difficult aspects of our nation, as well: racial conflict, civil rights, violence, poverty. Rockwell\u0027s America was complex and rich in its diversity. Kim Davis\u0027 America is an illusion.Professor of Theater, Ursinus CollegeEven though the for-profit college industry is now publicly discredited and on the ropes, facing collapsing enrollments, plummeting share prices, and growing federal and state law enforcement investigations, some GOP White House candidates are now brazenly competing for cash in the 2016 for-profit college primary.Attorney, advocate, writer at RepublicReport.orgNo one really wants to diet. It\u0027s all about what NOT to eat -- denial and deprivation. To compound the difficulty, how can you even know WHAT not to eat when advice keeps changing? No carbs, low carbs, no fat, yes fat, loads of meat, vegan. Here is an easier strategy.Author, health and wellness coachGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
