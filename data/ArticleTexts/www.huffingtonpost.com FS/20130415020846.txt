{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonWhen I heard that Margaret Thatcher had died, I immediately flashed back to the afternoon of February 11, 1975 when, on my car radio in London, I first heard the news that Thatcher had been elected leader of the Tory Party. What had been almost universally assumed to be impossible -- the election of a woman from a modest background to the highest position of power within the conservative establishment -- now suddenly seemed to have had been inevitable. And love her or loathe her (the Trafalgar Square \"party\" to celebrate her death reminds us how many did the latter), Margaret Thatcher was the kind of conviction-driven leader who can bridge the chasm between the impossible and the inevitable. In a week when even an anemic gun control bill had to fight off a filibuster -- and still faces a long, uphill road -- those working for its passage should ask themselves: what would Maggie do?Comments (119)Russell SimmonsFounder, GlobalGrind.comFor 42 years, we have waged war against our own people that we have disguised as the \"War on Drugs.\" All of this can be challenged and changed. Yet it is with a renewed sense of urgency that we must speak out and build an effective movement.Comments (930)Russell BrandActor and comedianWhen I was a kid, Thatcher was the headmistress of our country. Her voice, a bellicose yawn, somehow both boring and boring -- I could ignore the content but the intent drilled its way in. I am, safe to say, one of Thatcher\u0027s children. How then do I feel on this day of matriarchal mourning?Comments (891)Arianna HuffingtonLast week, President Obama proposed an initiative to map the complete structure and activity of the brain. I\u0027m all in favor of the effort, especially if it can unlock one particular mystery of those three pounds that was very much in evidence in the days following the president\u0027s proposal.Comments (1,368)Jeff CohenAuthor and media criticI spent years as a political pundit on mainstream TV -- at CNN, Fox News and MSNBC. I was outnumbered, outshouted, red-baited and finally terminated.Comments (859)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundIt\u0027s time for Congress to lead for children and for all of us in every state -- not just some -- to demand action not obstruction and to put protection of child and citizen safety ahead of guns -- especially deadly assault weapons and high capacity ammunition magazines that should not be in civilian hands.Comments (337)Jennifer 8. LeeReporter, AuthorWhen I was researching my book, on Chinese food in America, The Fortune Cookie Chronicles, it puzzled me why Korean cuisine (unlike many of its Asian brethren) had not gone mainstream yet.Comments (328)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027Today, on the National Mall, I stood with fellow faith leaders, including clergy from Newtown, to remember lives lost at Sandy Hook elementary school and the 3,364 gun deaths that have happened since.Comments (539)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistTime magazine reported that more than a third of American women are now the family breadwinner, yet they still \"lag behind men in actions crucial to building wealth and security, such as investing and having a long-term money plan.\" It is vital that we empower ourselves to take advantage of every opportunity to make our money work for us.Comments (63)Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOWe are now watching the second botching of a Cyprus rescue in less than a month. The implications cannot be good for Cyprus... and for Europe as a whole.Comments (65)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarWhere is the accommodation and adjustment taking the world of men? If the old model of masculinity has outlived its shelf life, what will the new one look like?Comments (513)Randy TurnerEnglish teacherYoung teachers from across the United States have told me they no longer have the ability to properly manage classrooms not because of lack of desire, but because of upper administration decisions to reduce statistics on classroom referrals and in-school and out-of-school suspensions.Comments (1,507)Shelley EmlingEditor, Post 50Even long-time, happily married couples sometimes need to watch what they say -- and how they say it. Just because you\u0027re extremely comfortable with someone doesn\u0027t mean you never have to watch your mouth.Comments (988)Norman LearFounder, People for the American WayA new law that is being proposed says the buyer has to wait three days if he wants to buy a gun that when you point it at a human being and pull the trigger you can kill him. Or her. Or that child there.Comments (535)Sen. Bernie SandersIndependent U.S. Senator from VermontDo we agree with Senator Inhofe that global warming is a \"hoax\" and that we do not want the federal government to address that issue? Or do we agree with the overwhelming majority of scientists who tell us that that we must act boldly and aggressively to protect the future of this planet?Comments (1,109)Anna Deavere SmithActress and playwrightNo matter how broken the system is, no matter how many broken moments our individual lives might survive, we all have a chance to make real the basic human drive to heal. We can do that, whatever our position in life is.Comments (26)Clayton KershawPitcher, Los Angeles DodgersSomething remarkable started the moment my wife, Ellen, and I first met Hope on a ministry trip to Zambia four years ago.CommentsPhaedra Ellis-LamkinsCEO, Green for AllNow I have a daughter. And I realize that I am carrying more than the extra weight I gained during my pregnancy. I am carrying shame -- shame that I cannot pass on to my little girl. I do not want her to share the legacy of self-hate that so many women feel.CommentsBill McKibbenAuthor of a dozen books, including \u0027The End of Nature\u0027 and \u0027Deep Economy\u0027It was certainly joyful to see marriage equality being considered by our top judicial body. In some ways, however, the most depressing spectacle of the week was watching Democratic leaders decide that, in 2013, it was finally safe to proclaim gay people actual human beings.Comments (301)James FrancoActor and authorLucky Guy is a tribute to the late Nora Ephron. The performers say at least 50 percent of their lines directly to the audience, so it becomes a case of telling rather than showing. I didn\u0027t find this to be a fault as much as a device that altered the theatrical form.Comments (16)Christina HuffingtonThe Andover girls\u0027 perspective begs the question of what exactly we consider to be \u0027leadership qualities\u0027?Comments (23)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesO\u0027Reilly surely is quite cognizant of keeping his ratings high as he sees support for gay marriage rise rapidly in the polls. But if the debate over marriage equality now needs to move into the Fox News audience, it\u0027s certainly not a bad thing to have O\u0027Reilly taking on the anti-equality crowd.Comments (181)Frances BeineckePresident, Natural Resources Defense CouncilGina McCarthy has been tapped to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, and given her track record of protecting America\u0027s families from toxic pollution, her confirmation will help us all breathe easier.Comments (32)Allen FrancesProfessor Emeritus, Duke UniversityThis well-meaning program is a serious mistake for two reasons. First, it is no more than a politically correct, cosmetic solution that distracts attention from what really needs to be done. Second, it will likely wind up doing much more harm than good.Comments (152)Ernest OwensCommunication \u0026 Public Service major, University of PennsylvaniaAs a man who grew up in an urban environment that is now attending college at a fine Ivy League institution, I would like to let you know that I am not aspiring to become the controlling, manipulative and reckless psychopath that you continue to depict such men of color in your films.Comments (393)Natalia Brzezinskiwriter, mother, wife of U.S. Ambassador to Sweden, women\u0027s empowerment activistFocus on finding something you love and work really hard at it. If you love what you do, you\u0027re probably good at it. This is the secret to Stina Honkamaa\u0027s success, according to the humble and effervescent Country Director of Google Sweden.CommentsDylan RatiganNew York Times Best-Selling author, entrepreneur and formerly the host of MSNBC\u0027s The Dylan Ratigan ShowBeyond jobs, food and our vets, few things keep me up more than the disastrous functionality of our prison system. It is, after all, no secret that the U.S. houses 25 percent of the world\u0027s inmates, while representing a mere 5 percent of the world\u0027s population.Comments (109)Bill GatesCo-chair of the Bill \u0026 Melinda Gates FoundationThe Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria announced today that it will need $15 billion to continue its life-saving work. If the world comes together to meet this replenishment goal, it will build on one of its greatest achievements of the past decade by saving millions more lives.Comments (31)Annette InsdorfDirector of undergraduate film studies, Columbia University, and author of PHILIP KAUFMANIf you are reading this sentence, you are probably part of the online universe into which the new film Disconnect is wired. Moving, smart and troubling, this ensemble piece is directed by Henry-Alex Rubin from a script by Andrew Stern.CommentsSen. Patty MurrayU.S. Senator from WashingtonParents, seniors, business owners, and workers are already sharing experiences with their elected leaders that make it clear sequestration must be replaced. And these stories are changing the one that\u0027s being told in Washington, D.C.Comments (121)Robert RedfordActor, director and environmental activistTar sands expansion rewards the oil industry while putting us all at risk of oil spills and climate change. That\u0027s a raw deal by any calculation.Comments (235)HuffPost Radio, 2013.14.04Michael Hogan, 2013.14.04Mary Ellen Harte, 2013.14.04Steven Strauss, 2013.14.04Ariel Wengroff, 2013.14.04Christopher Lamb, 2013.14.04Joanne Spataro, 2013.14.04Barbara Bruno, 2013.14.04Shawn Amos, 2013.14.04Rajan Menon, 2013.14.04Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"GUN SUICIDE AT NRA RACE",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
