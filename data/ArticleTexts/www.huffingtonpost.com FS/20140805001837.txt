{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghThe consequence of two nominally Democratic presidencies, aided and abetted by timid Congressional leadership, has been to sap the Democratic Party of conviction, of political savvy, and of fighting spirit. It is now dominated by those who have sold themselves to the established interests, by careerists whose sole commitment is to the next appointment or next elected office, and by trendy \"liberal\" intellectuals who derive some odd sense of superiority by attacking those who still feel for the common man; believe in public education and the Bill of Rights; question \"globalized\" trade deals that cut the ground from under American workers; and see through the deceit that is the Global War On Terror. Barack Obama is the personification of these trendy liberals; and they are his die-hard apologists and protectors.What someone is paid has little or no relationship to what their work is worth to society. Does anyone seriously believe hedge-fund mogul Steven A. Cohen is worth the $2.3 billion he raked in last year, despite being slapped with a $1.8 billion fine after his firm pleaded guilty to insider trading?Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027With the exception of a few courageous journalists, the American view of Gaza -- the posture of looking away with pity and calling it \"heartbreaking\" as if the wild disparity of deaths did not exist -- has been an abortion of moral responsibility. It testifies to a poverty of leadership almost as desperate as that of the Israelis and the Palestinians half a world away.Professor of Literature, Yale UniversityThe corporate under-written Common Core standards and tests are at best a distraction and at worse add grievous insult to injury for children of color.Co-Founder, Network for Public EducationYou will never stop worrying, or doubting yourself, but you will have more proof that you are doing it right. Each day that passes is another day that you get to take credit for.Mother, Wife, Blogger, mamabythebay.comThere is certainly no basis for either fear of, or opposition to, the on-going treatment of an infected American doctor in Atlanta. We may instead all be thankful that in return for the courageous service he was providing in Liberia, Dr. Brantly is now receiving an American standard of medical care himselfDirector, Yale Prevention Research Centerust as Peter Drucker was \"the father of management,\" Warren Bennis will be remembered as \"the father of leadership.\" It was Warren who first said leadership is not a set of genetic characteristics, but rather the result of the lifelong process of self-discovery.Professor of Management Practice, Harvard Business SchoolDating a vegan isn\u0027t any more difficult than dating anyone else -- all it takes is an open mind, an open heart, and maybe a box or two of vegan condoms.Co-author, The Lusty VeganLast week Woody Allen finally \"broke his silence\" regarding his casting of or, lack of African-Americans. Why the world felt it necessary to hold the director of \"Scoop\" and \"Cassandra\u0027s Dream\" accountable for the lack of African-Americans in cinema is a little beyond me.Host, HuffPost LiveTrans-Exclusionary Radical Feminism, or TERF, is a loosely-organized collective with a message of hate and exclusion against transgender women in particular. They have attached themselves to radical feminism as a means to attempt to deny trans women basic access to health care, women\u0027s groups, restroom facilities, and more.Musician, writer, social justice activist, social media guruThe economy grew at an impressive rate of four percent in the second quarter of this year, according to a government report released on Wednesday. But the stock market promptly tanked. The Dow lost more than 317 points Thursday and another 70 points Friday. What gives?Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The NRA has a lock on communicating with the gun-owning community, but a majority of Americans don\u0027t own guns. So how do you engage this usually-silent majority to counteract the power and influence of the NRA?Mike the Gun GuyWhether it\u0027s James Brown or Eric Garner, police shouldn\u0027t be trained or allowed to go above the law in the name of enforcing the law.President, National Action NetworkThese two bills do not represent a coherent response to our border crisis. They reflect Speaker Boehner\u0027s failed leadership as well as the triumph of immigration extremists. While these bills will have zero policy impact, the GOP will likely feel their political impact for years to come -- and not in a good way.Attorney; USA Today Columnist, NBC News ContributorI have had this infliction all my life for as along as I can remember. Can you imagine what is is like growing up in school with a stutter? It sucks. I was teased, mocked, mimicked and laughed at.BloggerGenerally speaking, its powers and prerogatives remain beyond constraint by that third branch of government, the non-secret judiciary. It is deferred to with remarkable frequency by the executive branch and, with the rarest of exceptions, it has been supported handsomely with much obeisance and few doubts by Congress.Editor, TomDispatch.comLet\u0027s be clear: This shameful record is not an example of \"government failure.\" It is a demonstration of what happens when people who are opposed to government, for reasons of both ideology and self-interest, are given positions of power within it and do not face a sufficiently eloquent and well-organized opposition.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourMoving toward a SportsWorld of equality is unfortunately a slow, painful process. Not everyone wants to go along for the ride. They have to be pushed and pulled, kicking and screaming. Making people face what makes them uncomfortable is part of the process; part of the march to equality on our playing fields and in our locker rooms.Sports Policy Director, League of FansPerfectly reasonable humans turn into walking rom-com tropes when it comes to the future of their relationships.Essayist, dramaturg, and playwrightOur last place ranking on the KIDS COUNT list is no accident. Nor are our nationally low literacy, employment and high school graduation rates. Rather, they are the consistent result of a political mindset that insists upon punishment for people at the bottom of the economic ladder.President and CEO, Mississippi Center for JusticeSenate Republicans last week prevented repair of a law that 99.99 percent of Americans hate and condemn and would vote 50 times to repeal, given the chance. The GOP blocked a bill that would have ended tax breaks bestowed on corporations for offshoring factories and jobs.International President, United SteelworkersLike so many young girls, I spent much of my childhood playing with my Barbie. While my friends\u0027 Barbies were making wedding plans with Ken or decorating their Barbie homes, my Barbie was studying to be a lawyer. Though she was happy dating Ken, she was in no rush to marry him. She never sat in the passenger\u0027s seat of her convertible. She drove.Wife, mother and blogger, ImperfectMommy.comOur efforts aren\u0027t about shutting down debate. Quite the opposite. We\u0027re asking for a more robust debate that begins with an accurate accounting of the facts and greater accountability when things go wrong.Communications Director at CEL\u0027s Climate LabWhy are we so drawn these days to the tale of Lear and his dysfunctional family? John Lithgow, the award-winning actor and writer, is playing him right now in The Public Theater\u0027s Free Shakespeare in the Park production. This week he talks to Bill.Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyOn the geopolitical side, things are not so black and white. It\u0027s tempting to cast this conflict as a battle between Muslim Arabs and Jews, but it is also inaccurate. This latest battle is really a struggle between a new Middle East and the old one.Author and commentatorWe have heard again and again that we are losing \"the global competition\" to nations like South Korea where students and parents take tests very seriously. But are test scores worth it?Research Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027President Obama recently designated July 27 as \"Korean War Veteran\u0027s Armistice Day.\" In the days since, I have found myself reflecting on the meaning of the Armistice and on the effect it has had on my country in the intervening 60 years. Three key words emerge in my reflection.Ambassador of the Republic of Korea to the United StatesReligious organizations receiving federal contracts can no longer discriminate against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender employees. Some question whether President Obama has gone too far. Others question whether he has gone far enough.Legal Researcher and WriterThis past week the Arab American Institute (AAI) released its third biannual poll of American attitudes toward Arabs and Muslims. Conducted by Zogby Analytics, 1100 likely voters were surveyed nationwide. The results were deeply troubling.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Sometimes it\u0027s the luck of the draw, but sometimes the request is made ineffectively, wasting the time of someone who doesn\u0027t have much to waste. Here are some tips for successfully reaching busy people.Dept. Chair of East-West Psychology, California Institute of Integral StudiesAthletes have a unique role to play in triggering attitudinal change regarding violence against women. When they are instigators of this behavior, it sends a message that it is somehow acceptable because our heroes are involved.Sports and Entertainment AgentGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"168 MILLION CHILD LABORERS WORLDWIDE",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
