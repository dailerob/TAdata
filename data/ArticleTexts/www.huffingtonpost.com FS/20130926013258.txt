{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jon SoltzCo-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranObamacare is, as Joe Biden called it, a \"B.F.D.\" for veterans and their families. That brings us back to Ted Cruz, and his Tea Party allies in the House. They\u0027re now trying to block veterans and their families from getting affordable health insurance. And if they don\u0027t get their way? They\u0027ll shut down the government. That would be an unmitigated disaster, in terms of health care for those troops and veterans who actually do have it right now through the Department of Defense or VA. In short, the two options being offered up by Ted Cruz and the Tea Party -- defunding Obamacare or shutting down the government -- only serves to hurt the health of troops and veterans, and their families.Comments (294)Peter S.

Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorSince we\u0027ve never defaulted, we don\u0027t know how much it will cost, with \"cost\" here meaning spending that would be avoided if we didn\u0027t screw around with the debt ceiling.Comments (222)Kimberly BrooksArtist www.kimberlybrooks.comDon\u0027t get me wrong, I love food. I love nothing more than the beauty of a well-plated meal. But believe me when I tell you that no matter how hungry or excited you are about what you\u0027re about to post on Instagram and Facebook, it NEVER looks as good to anyone else as it does to you.Comments (122)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Comments (339)Barbara Hannah GruffermanAuthor, \"The Best of Everything After 50,\" Host, AARP YouTube Channel; Positive Living ExpertShortly after turning 50, I had dinner with a group of girlfriends.

His main goal is to get sanctions lifted. But his speech to the UN was a bit heavy-handed, except for the outreach for talks with the West.CommentsDean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027There are serious complaints about the inadequacy of Obamacare that will have to be addressed in the years ahead.

Are these errant dreams as the world barrels toward more confusion, conflict and climate change, or is there something substantial in the recent wave of high-level interest in the idea?Comments (17)Ryan Costello and Jamal AbdiIf Rouhani fails to deliver results in the form of sanctions relief, hardliners within Iran who distrust his conciliatory approach will move to block chances for a nuclear deal.

Lois CappsU.S. Representative for California\u0027s 24th DistrictWhile we debate over how to appropriately respond to the actions of the Syrian government, there should be no doubt that the United States needs to assist in ensuring the welfare, protection and safety of refugees, particularly women and children.CommentsLewis LaphamEditor of Lapham\u0027s QuarterlyI count it a lucky break to have been born in a day and age when answers to the question \"Why do I have to die?\" were still looked for in the experimental laboratories of art and literature as well as in the teachings of religion.
