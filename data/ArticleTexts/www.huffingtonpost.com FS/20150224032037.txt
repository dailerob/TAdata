{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Managing Director, IMFLeveling the legal playing field for women holds real promise for the world -- in both human and economic terms. Unfortunately, that promise remains largely ignored and its potential untapped. Despite some progress over the past few years, gender-based legal restrictions remain significant. Almost 90 percent of countries have at least one important restriction in the books, and some have many. These range from the requirement for women to seek their husband\u0027s permission to work, to laws that restrict women\u0027s participation in specific professions. Others constrain the ability of women to own property, or to inherit, or to obtain a loan. What can be done to remove these barriers? A new study done by IMF economists seeks to answer that question.It now amusing for Democrats to watch the \"Ted Cruz wing\" of the GOP try to defend their big DHS bill, just as it will be amusing to watch them howl later this week when it gets split in two. All a Democrat will have to do to really rub it in will be to say, \"But you\u0027ve been saying all along that immigration reform can only be done one tiny step at a time!\"Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comLike it or not, the 2016 presidential election will be about national security. And most Americans and most voters will be very fearful of the threat that the Islamic State represents and confused about how we should respond. The Islamic State is a true threat, and one that presents difficult if not impossible choices.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027For the third time in four years, the Oscar for Best Picture has gone to a film about film -- a \"meta-film\" if you will. If we wanted to, we could take this observation and ask the question: What does this say about the Academy? But instead, why don\u0027t we take this Academy bias and ask a harder question.Social Scientist, Duke UniversitySo many war correspondents are similar to the many men and women in uniform, who work hard, do their jobs, and even perform acts of heroism, that you\u0027ll never hear about, and who never go around bragging, seeking recognition. Then, we have Bill O\u0027Reilly.Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranKYIV -- What happens in Ukraine -- not the financial standoff with Greece -- will be the ultimate test of whether European and transatlantic unity endure. The fault lines extending from Ukraine are undermining the fundamental values that have underpinned Europe\u0027s postwar peace and prosperity. Failure to defend those values in Ukraine will cause them to unravel far beyond our borders.Fmr. prime minister of Ukraine; Current leader of All-Ukrainian Union \"Fatherland\" (\"Batkivshchyna\")The rise of \"independent contractors\" is the most significant legal trend in the American workforce -- contributing directly to low pay, irregular hours and job insecurity. It\u0027s become a race to the bottom.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027From President Obama\u0027s calls for equal pay to the House Democrats\u0027 Women Succeed agenda to the nonpartisan National Women\u0027s Law Center to now Oscar night itself, this issue is gaining traction.Chair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusWhen the political establishment wants to pass major trade agreements, we see respectable Washington types making pronouncements bearing so little relationship to reality that they would cause Sarah Palin to cringe. The Washington Post gave us one such gem last week when it took issue with those saying currency rules should be part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Last week the nation was treated to the sad and embarrassing spectacle of Jeb Bush, mollycoddled scion to an empire of failure, proclaiming that \"I\u0027m my own man.\" Here\u0027s a simple rule of thumb: Anyone who has to say he\u0027s his own man, or woman, isn\u0027t.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourIs this what we want, to make people nervous about engaging in dialogue? I hate to think about all the teachable moments that never happened because someone was afraid to ask me -- or any of us -- a question.Producer, HuffPost LiveAs controversy surrounding Bill O\u0027Reilly and his previous claims of harrowing \"combat\" journalism escalates, this would be the moment when most news organizations would step in and announce that an internal review was underway to ascertain the truth. But not Fox News.Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaIran\u0027s youth are eager to play an assertive role but through peaceful behaviors that would force the regime to comply.Author, The Lonely War: One Woman’s Account of the Struggle for Modern IranAs a country, Haiti has faced and continues to face enormous difficulties, but it has also proven remarkably resilient.Director, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)One of the more depressing political attacks in recent history was launched by the former Mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, against President Obama. With strong implications of racism, Giuliani claimed that Obama did not love his country.Playwright, director, actor, educator, theater founderPenn\u0027s unwarranted remark is as obscene as questioning, \"who gave blacks the right to vote?\" or \"who gave women the right to pursue an education?\"Student and campus-editor-at-large, Florida State UniversityDo we need annual testing to tell us that poverty in childhood has lifelong consequences in health, education, and economic opportunity? Do we need annual testing to tell us that communities with high concentrations of minority students from impoverished households struggle on test-based measures?Director of Secondary Education and Secondary Special Education Teacher Preparation, Seton Hall UniversityEven for Pakistan-watchers who privilige nuance over sensation, the question of why our country continues to grapple with a disease that has been preventable for over half a century, certainly begs an answer.Health activist for Pakistan and Global CitizenLet\u0027s be clear about who Giuliani is: a faded, irrelevant Republican leader who seeks attention and will say and do ridiculous things in order to achieve that. Though I myself have been accused of seeking attention, I seek attention around issues, causes and cases.President, National Action NetworkThe host of the awards has no place contradicting the view of a documentary filmmaker who has just spoken eloquently of the subject of her film.Paul J. Tillich Professor of Theology and Culture, Emeritus Union Theological Seminary; Author; TheologianFried chicken just might be the world\u0027s most versatile food.Everything worth caring about in food, drink, and travelWe have a big problem: the Israeli Prime Minister wants to drag the US into a proxy war for Israel against Iran, and Jews are likely to get the blame when that war turns out be an even bigger disaster than the US war in Iraq.Editor, Tikkun MagazineGraeme Wood\u0027s article in The Atlantic last week charging that ISIL is the natural expression of Islam has created quite a stir. Overwrought and poorly informed in its claim that the roots of violent extremism are in Mohammed and the Koran, and that Bakr al-Baghdadi is a theologian-prophet, it has given a boost to the Islamophobes.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghJust weeks ago, the Washington Post described Scott Walker as the first \"it\" candidate of the 2016 presidential races, but after stumbling over \"truth,\" evolution, and whether or not the President is a Christian or loves America, Walker is getting ready to change the topic.The Center for Media and Democracy/ALEC ExposedThe U.S. media has a China fever, which results in typically feverish reports that don\u0027t take the pulse of the country or its leader. In the process, so much is missed.Roving correspondent for the Asia TimesIt makes little sense to continue with the same tactic of perpetual war, without any assurance of a better strategic outcome. To assume that another Iraq war will keep us \"safe\" doesn\u0027t address the nature of terrorism or the nature of failed wars.Columnist, journalist, and author published in The Hill\u0027s Congress Blog, The Jerusalem Post, Salon.com, and other publicationsThe Academy Awards were created to recognize cinematic achievements in film. However, when the voters are primarily white men, it is not surprising that people of color are not given the recognition they deserve.Founder and managing director, Keating AdvisorsNever did I ever expect Lady Gaga to do a medley of songs from The Sound of Music. Then when she introduced and embraced Dame Julie Andrews, I kept thinking \"Pop royalty meets actual royalty.\"Lawyer; writer; film, TV, and pop-culture aficionado; social media expert and correspondent; awards show enthusiast; and big dreamer.Vaccinations protect the human species against diseases for which there is no cure once the infection occurs. In this respect, vaccines become the cure for certain diseases through prevention, whereas we usually think of being cured as what doctors do to us after we get sick.Mike the Gun GuyWe were untamed, raw and daring. We used words like f*ck and sh*t proudly and loudly at stupid boys and into thin air. We didn\u0027t worry about what others thought about us, because we were happy with who we are.Published writer, advocate and mother.We cubicle dwellers have our own subculture. We are among the working class who don\u0027t get to go outside and blow stuff up. We can identify each other by the hollow looks in our eyes and the standard defeated shoulder slump.
