{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Thanks to a last-minute deal last Thursday between President Obama and the Republican leadership in Congress, the fast-track bill is still alive. Its passage depends on whether a handful of Senate Democrats can be persuaded to go along. If there is a grand bargain to be had on a trade deal, it should go something like this: Globalization should be used to increase, not depress, labor and environmental standards. For starters, one key nation that fails to enforce the right of its workers to organize or join unions should be compelled to do so. That would be the United States of America. Before Democrats entertain any more corporate wish lists, let\u0027s see what corporate America is offering in return. Trade adjustment assistance doesn\u0027t do it. A few Democrats may vote for the deal because they naively think TAA is a defensible trade-off. Most who hide behind this scanty fig leaf know exactly what they are doing.People often ask me whether being President has made it more difficult to spend time with Michelle and our girls. But the surprising truth is that being in the White House has made our family life more \"normal\" than it\u0027s ever been.44th President of the United StatesMost of us are silent as one more senseless mass shooting traumatizes a community, this time in South Carolina. I am sick and tired of silence. Silence is killing us. Who is ultimately responsible for dozens of gun lobby sponsored bills advancing each year in conservative legislatures? We are.Missouri State RepresentativeWhen real people plead guilty to felonies, they go to jail. But big banks aren\u0027t people despite what the five Republican appointees to the Supreme Court say.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027I\u0027m proud to be a Senator, but I\u0027m even prouder to be a dad. This Father\u0027s Day, let\u0027s embrace true family values and push for fair, inclusive family leave that will make our economy work better for everyone.US Senator from OregonWhat happened to our family is part of a larger attack on Black and Brown bodies. To impact change, we must recognize the connection between racism, hate crimes and racialized policing. While the focus for this specific attack was on African-Americans, we all have a responsibility to seek not only justice for the victims, but an end to racial injustice.Minister for Youth Advocacy and Leadership Formation, United Church of Christ; Cousin of Rev. Depayne MiddletonNo matter how much their fathers may have disappointed or hurt them, all the women I met felt a measure of loyalty and gratitude to them. Fathers matter a great deal not only in childhood but well into adulthood -- and yet few women are truly aware of the ways in which their fathers impact them.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarWhy are people willing to pay for the right to put their message on a license plate, rather than just put it on a bumper sticker? Justice Breyer suggests that it is because they want the state\u0027s endorsement of their message. The problem, though, is that this is about the state discriminating among private speakers based on whether it approves or disapproves of the message. This, the First Amendment does not permit.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoAs we fight our way back from the recession, it\u0027s clear that our economy isn\u0027t working for everyone. Too many don\u0027t have the skills they need for the jobs available. As a union, the AFT takes on these issues. This work isn\u0027t loud or provocative, but it\u0027s vital for our communities and our nation.President, American Federation of TeachersWhen the U.S.\u0027 murder rate and mass shooting rates are stacked up against the rest of the world, it becomes clear that we not only have a problem -- we have a sickness -- and it is killing us, literally. And yet we go from mass killing to mass killing, numb for a day, and then we move on.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027The Pope\u0027s future is different, but we want to move in the same direction out of this particular dark patch of time. And, although the disagreements concern \"philosophical\" questions, they will not have theoretical answers, only historical ones. Time will tell.Professor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027If one does what one can do to make the world a better place, that\u0027s all God will ask... it is a job that can make your life worth living, no matter what else happens.Former Governor of New YorkWhen states fail to pass laws that effectively restrict access to illegal guns, and instead enact laws to make it easier to buy and carry guns, they fail to sufficiently value Black lives and the lives of other Americans adversely affected by gun crime and violence.Professor of Law at The George Washington University Law School; Senior Fellow at DemosProgram Director, Joyce FoundationIn honor of those nine souls and of the countless others who preceded them, we will continue to exist, to protest, to remain open, to stand, and to pray. The doors of the church are open.The right to abortion is grounded in the Fourteenth Amendment, which protects all of us from undue government interference with our liberty interests. More than 20 years ago, the Supreme Court made this clear when it reaffirmed the constitutional right to abortion in Planned Parenthood v. Casey.Executive Vice President for University Life, Columbia University, and Herbert and Doris Wechsler Clinical Professor of Law, Columbia Law SchoolIt\u0027s really funny that Tucker Max is telling you this, isn\u0027t it? To not focus on yourself? Because you\u0027re probably thinking, \"Didn\u0027t you sell millions of books that were just talking about yourself?\" Actually, no.CEO of Book In A Box, #1 New York Times Best Selling authorFor a brief moment yesterday, Times Square stood still. Even the world\u0027s most famous cluster of dazzling super signs, towering over Broadway, could not compete with the simple message that on this day, we all stand for elephants.President and CEO, Wildlife Conservation SocietyI am still in love with the person I married back in 1984. A person who today is a she. I have witnessed true joy in the person I\u0027ve grown a life with -- a person whose blue eyes shine because she feels right in her own skin.An ordinary woman in an extraordinary marriage. An ordinary writer musing over extraordinary thoughts.What is around us that would tacitly or implicitly give permission to someone to pick up a gun and kill nine people? All the signs, all the permission he ever needed was in a flag, in a sentence, in a supposedly harmless joke, in the privacy of a car, in a home late at night, in a status update. All of it, was always just there.South African poet, creator of I Wrote This For YouOver a decade ago, writer Dan Buettner teamed up with National Geographic and a team of scientists to explore these areas, now called the \"Blue Zones.\" His latest book, The Blue Zones Solution, takes a closer look at their healthy lifestyle habits -- particularly how they\u0027re eating. Here\u0027s a look at each region\u0027s key secret to long life that you can practice daily.As fathers, it is our duty to explain even the most difficult issues to our children. This Father\u0027s Day, let\u0027s focus on HIV.Nigerian singer and UNICEF Goodwill AmbassadorI know my father died a hero. Even after being shot multiple times, he courageously fought off the gunman, saving many, including my mother, at the expense of his own life. He defended the temple he founded, and this house of worship is the gift he left to us and his grandchildren. Just like Felicia Sanders. She sacrificed her body to cover and shield her young granddaughter, as her son, Tywanza, tried to talk down the gunman.Community Organizer, Filmmaker, ActivistIt is funny how if we accomplish the little things, everything else in life seems to run smoother. We feel better about ourselves, we have more stability in our relationships, our homes are more pleasant to be in, we are healthier, and we are under less stress generally.Writer, attorney and co-founder of the blog, LadieswithOpinions.com.It turns out that our unique tapestry of emotional responses -- whether joy, anger, curiosity, disgust, surprise, sadness, fear, shame or guilt -- all serve a distinctive purpose. Even though we might like to eliminate unfavorable emotions, they serve an important role.Behavioral Therapist and Author of Reset: Make the Most of Your StressEleanor Roosevelt deserves to be a gay icon -- even if she was 100 percent straight. Homosexuality may have been stigmatized, even criminalized, during her lifetime, but that didn\u0027t stop her from befriending gay women regardless of what people thought of them or her.Co-author of \u0027Hissing Cousins: The Untold Story of Eleanor Roosevelt and Alice Longworth\u0027Retiring early -- or leaving the work force for the golf course, if you like -- might sound like an unattainable goal. That\u0027s especially true if you look at the challenge from a pure cash paradigm. But there are many ways to make it, so long as you take numerous approaches into account.Leading personal finance and consumer banking website\u0027Mummy\u0027s home!\u0027 is what I say when I return. When the cat hears that she assumes reason has been restored to her life because she is the Queen and I am the Prime Minister. But when the dog hears this, he knows that the lady who dispenses food is back where she needs to be to feed him. And all is right in the world.Architect, attorney, badass mother writer and the author of an irreverent novel, Thin Rich Bitches.Tired of your boneless skinless chicken breasts coming off the grill dry, tough and chewy?

They can assess if there are underlying conditions to resolve and prescribe the right treatments and medications when applicable.Writer, Content Manager at AmerisleepI\u0027m grateful that I no longer look to other people to give me answers. I learned this the hard way, when I woke up at 50 realizing that I\u0027d been living someone else\u0027s life, and it hadn\u0027t worked out well.Blogger, A Sexy Woman of A Certain AgeWhat\u0027s the secret to actually making time for meditation?Health and fitness articles to help you live a healthier, happier and more active lifestyle.
