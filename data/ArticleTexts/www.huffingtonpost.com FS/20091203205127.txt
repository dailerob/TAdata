The initial idea for HuffPost was hatched in LA, five years ago this month. And LA has been my home base since 1997. So LA is definitely part of HuffPost\u0027s DNA. It\u0027s also one of the most dynamic and diverse cities in the world. As with our other locals, HuffPost LA will feature up-to-the-minute local news and a vibrant group of bloggers offering their takes on all aspects of life in LA, from the glamour of the entertainment business to the human hardships caused by the budget cuts at the state and local level -- and everything in between.
