{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week was a tumultuous one around the world. U.S. officials condemned a \"deplorable\" video showing Marines urinating on the corpses of suspected Taliban fighters in Afghanistan -- and categorically denied any U.S. involvement in the car bomb killing of an Iranian nuclear scientist in Tehran. In Europe, Standard \u0026 Poor\u0027s stripped France of its AAA credit rating (sacre bleu!) and downgraded eight other countries. In China, Apple halted sales of the iPhone 4S after a near-riot outside the company\u0027s flagship store in Beijing (what does Siri have to say about that?). Meanwhile, here at home, Rick Perry condemned \"vulture capitalism,\" a Gingrich-aligned super PAC released a long Romney-as-rapacious-capitalist video that looked like it had been produced by Occupy, and John McCain called Citizens United \"one of the worst decisions I have ever seen.\" Welcome to 2012\u0027s beyond left and right politics.Read Post | Comments (40)Mohamed A.

They are half right.Read Post | Comments (60)Roderick Spencer, 1/15/12Screenwriter, producer, comedian, teacher and social activistAlbert Nobbs should\u0027ve been called The Tedious Little Man Who Is Actually a Tedious Little Woman. Yet, despite its many, many flaws, it is a prototypical award season movie.Read Post | CommentsMaria Bello, 1/12/12ActressHaiti is not just \"rebuilding\" with cement and muscle. Haiti is \"reimagining\" a nation, with a bold vision and collective dream.Read Post | Comments (65)Gary Hart, 1/12/12President, Hart International, Ltd.The shift from traditional capitalism to money culture is pretty well-known. What is surprising is that it is now being discovered and strongly criticized by Republican leaders who, up to now, have been silent on this transformation of American capitalism.Read Post | Comments (584)Arianna Huffington, 1/10/12Perhaps the profound disconnect between what people are really concerned about and what the 2012 candidates are talking about is why only 17 percent of Americans are satisfied with the way things are going.Read Post | Comments (557)Dylan Ratigan, 1/9/12Host, MSNBC\u0027s \u0027The Dylan Ratigan Show\u0027; Author, \u0027Greedy Bastards\u0027; Founder, Get Money Out FoundationMost people think of this as an election, where voters go to the polls and select their preferred candidate. But I believe, and an increasing number of viewers believe, that our political system has become an auction in which the highest bidder wins.Read Post | Comments (414)Robert F. Kennedy Jr., 1/9/12President, Waterkeeper Alliance; Professor, Pace UniversityWill Romney lead the GOP with the brand of decency that is his heritage, or will he choose instead to outsource indecency and mudslinging to surrogates and Super PACs?Read Post | Comments (565)Lee Woodruff, 1/14/12Co-Author, \u0027In an Instant\u0027I\u0027m drowning. Drowning in emails. Each day a new tsunami of sometimes meaningful, mostly useless, trivial, occasionally important and often spammy correspondence washes ashore on my laptop like ocean detritus, and it\u0027s my job to pick through it.Read Post | Comments (44)Harvey Weinstein, 1/13/12Film ProducerIn today\u0027s world of tightly controlled public relations, is there any way to be other than safe? I always find myself rooting for people who stand up for what they believe in, and it always gives me a great charge to see it happen.Read Post | Comments (92)Desmond Tutu, 1/12/121984 Nobel Peace Prize winnerOur own stories, experiences and gifts are the incubators of good news. When we allow our imagination to be engaged with the needs of the world around us, we actively participate in expanding love and compassion. When we do so, God is tickled pink!Read Post | Comments (57)Tressie McMillan Cottom, 1/13/12PhD student, Department of Sociology, Emory UniversityKaplan\u0027s assertion that students\u0027 fears and pain should be used to motivate them insinuates what many of us suspect to be true of the people who end up at for-profit colleges: they are lazy and stupid. But the students I worked with were not lazy, unmotivated, or stupid.Read Post | Comments (238)Jon Soltz, 1/12/12Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranThere are no words to express my disgust at the video making the rounds today, of U.S. Marines apparently urinating on the dead bodies of the Taliban.Read Post | Comments (405)Christopher Hitchens, 1/12/12The late journalist, author, essayistIn this lost essay by the late Christopher Hitchens, he reveals his penchant for right-wing women.

But this timing is not optimal and the ancestry guesswork is often wrong. Consumers should have the choice to test before conception.Read Post | Comments (13)Van Jones, 1/12/12President, RebuildtheDream.com; Author of NY Times bestseller, \u0027The Green-Collar Economy\u0027MLK day is a chance to look back and look ahead -- let\u0027s reflect on one of the most important movements of our past as a springboard for the ongoing fight for justice.Read Post | Comments (26)Donna Karan, 1/11/12Fashion designer; HumanitarianIt\u0027s hard to believe it\u0027s been two years.
