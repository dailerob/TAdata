{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-Director of the Center for Economic and Policy ResearchMany of us have long advocated a green economy where jobs were generated in sectors like alternative energy and recycling. It was our hope that this economy could be both environmentally friendly and offer opportunities for rising living standards. Well, we\u0027ve now got a green economy and there\u0027s plenty of recycling, but it\u0027s not exactly what most of us had in mind.

Bernie Sanders, 12.06.2010Independent U.S. Senator from VermontFar from meeting FCC\u0027s standards, the takeover of NBC by Comcast would create a monolithic media superpower and cause irreparable damage to the American media landscape and society as a whole.Read Post | CommentsMarty Kaplan, 12.06.2010Director, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolI used to imagine the president was playing 11-dimensional political chess with Republicans, a strategy I was too dim to grasp.

Fortunately, we have a six-step program designed to heal Dimon\u0027s Inner Banker.Read Post | CommentsEric Hippeau, 12.06.2010CEO, The Huffington PostBy providing seasoned mentors to growing companies and start-ups, the NYC Economic Development Corporation Venture Fellows program gives innovative entrepreneurs a pivotal leg up.Read Post | CommentsMichael Shaw, 12.06.2010Publisher of the visual politics and photojournalism site, BagNewsNotesMale politicians are typically lampooned for their private parts, but the punchlines always play off something the politician did. This Hillary lampoon, in contrast, targets something she is.Read Post | CommentsBob Saget, 12.06.2010Comedian and actorAs crazy as the world has been, and continues to be, I personally went through a very strange and life-changing 2010.

That\u0027s no coincidence; job creation and deficit reduction are inextricably linked.Read Post | CommentsRobert Naiman, 12.06.2010Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicyThe Guardian article should not have used the present tense to describe US policy based on the leaked cables while ignoring its own reporting, subsequent to the dates of the leaked cables, that the US said its policy had changed.Read Post | CommentsAmitai Etzioni, 12.06.2010GWU ProfessorThe crux of the deficit issue is political, not mathematical. And speaking politically, whatever the Democrats do about cutting the deficit, the Republicans will claim it is too little.Read Post | CommentsJeff Jarvis, 12.05.2010Author: \u0027Public Parts\u0027, \u0027What Would Google Do?\u0027Let us use this latest WikiLeaks episode to examine as citizens just how secret and how transparent our governments should be. For today, in the internet age, power shifts from those who hold secrets to those who create openness. That is our emerging reality.Read Post | CommentsRobert Kuttner, 12.05.2010Co-founder and co-editor of The American ProspectIf we are to be spared an awful decade, both economically and politically, Obama needs to grow a backbone and the progressive community needs to stop crying in our beer and get out and organize.Read Post | CommentsAlan B.

But, regrettably, I believe that the time has come to do this.Read Post | CommentsPaul Stoller, 12.06.2010Professor of Anthropology, West Chester UniversityThose who seek power have understood the political punch of myth and ritual. They have always manipulated these central components of social life to further their interests -- and none of this changes during the Holidays.Read Post | CommentsJonathan Askin, 12.06.2010Professor, Brooklyn Law SchoolIn 1971, the government might have considered Daniel Ellsberg\u0027s release of the Pentagon Papers the greatest threat to national security.

McCoy, 12.06.2010Professor of History at the University of Wisconsin-MadisonInstead of the bloodshed that marked the end of so many past empires, this 21st-century imperial collapse could come relatively quietly through the invisible tendrils of economic collapse or cyberwarfare.Read Post | CommentsJames K. Galbraith, 12.06.2010Economist, AuthorWhat we have in Obama is George W. Bush\u0027s policies without Bush\u0027s toughness, without his in-your-face refusal to compromise prematurely.
