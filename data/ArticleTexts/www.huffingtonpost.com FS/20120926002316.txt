{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Ciao from Rome, where I\u0027m delighted to announce the launch of L\u0027Huffington Post, bringing HuffPost\u0027s signature mix of news, blogging, community, and social engagement to Italy. I\u0027ve always had a great fondness for the boot-shaped country and as a Greek, I feel a kinship with a fellow Mediterranean land where someone is always trying to get you to eat something and nothing starts on time. L\u0027HuffPost will celebrate Italy\u0027s vibrant culture, from its cuisine, operas, and art to its traditions, ancient history and legendary cities. Please join me in welcoming Italia to the HuffPost family. And as always, let us know what you think!Read Post | Comments (443)Alec Baldwin, 09/24/12ActorAmerica will never be great again under a Romney administration. It will be great for rich people, while everyone else will be asked to dial down their expectations of what it means to be an American, again.Read Post | Comments (1,329)Lucia Annunziata, 09/25/12Editorial Director, L\u0027Huffington PostHuffington Post Italia signifies the creation of a new civic space. In this era of endangered enthusiasms and fresh longings, we aim to challenge received wisdom and initiate passionate debate. This is our promise.Read Post | Comments (22)Marlo Thomas, 09/25/12Award-winning actress, author, and activistEarlier this summer, my brother Tony heard \"Hey Jude\" on the radio and suddenly had an epiphany: Why not lend the eternal spirit and infectious melody of that memorable Beatles anthem to that other Jude we care so much about?Read Post | Comments (37)Robert Reich, 09/25/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Mitt Romney\u0027s failing isn\u0027t that he\u0027s a bad candidate. To the contrary, he\u0027s giving this GOP exactly what it wants in a candidate. And that\u0027s exactly the problem for Romney.Read Post | CommentsRussell Simmons, 09/25/12Founder, GlobalGrind.comOn this day of reflection and introspection, are we really OK to turn our heads and look the other way when our Muslim brothers and sisters are held up for contempt in such a public way?Read Post | Comments (36)Jon Soltz, 09/25/12Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranIt\u0027s a provocative headline from Politico: \"Veterans Retreating from President Obama.\" Provocative, but not exactly true.Read Post | Comments (12)David Wild, 09/25/12TV Writer; Contributing Editor, Rolling Stone; Co-Author, \u0027Diary of a Player\"\u0027This was truly the NFL\u0027s Night of Shame, and it had better be the last. Last night\u0027s misadventure in Seattle is bigger than one football game. It\u0027s about the stunning arrogance of Roger Goodell and the NFL in thinking fans will not care if the game they love is officiated in a remotely professional and fair manner.Read Post | Comments (78)Stuart Whatley, 09/25/12Senior Blog Editor, Huffington Post Media Group; Senior Voices Editor, Huffington magazineNever was a word that you\u0027re not supposed to say naturalized in such a way.Read Post | Comments (20)Nils Pickert, 09/25/12WriterIt is not OK for anybody to mess with my son about his outfit. Hence I wear dresses and skirts so that any person who has a problem with that and feels the necessity to express his or her resentments can mess with me.Read Post | Comments (184)Evelyn Leopold, 09/25/12Veteran journalist reporting from the United NationsThe civil war in Syria and its 26,000 dead are dominating this week\u0027s U.N. General Assembly session but no solution is expected to emerge. The same goes for the Islamic uprisings against the United States and Iran\u0027s nuclear program.Read Post | Comments (28)Jane Czyzselska and Alena Dierickx, 09/25/12Since Naomi Wolf released Vagina: A New Biography, we\u0027ve seen an endless number of personal attacks masquerading as critique and a denigration of the author\u0027s work, mental health and intelligence -- critiques no man would dare to make, lest he be accused of misogyny.Read Post | CommentsPaul Stoller, 09/25/12Professor of Anthropology, West Chester University; Author, \u0027The Power of the Between\u0027In America there seems to be an increasingly widespread aversion to the act of reading. In support of that aversion voters have elected public officials whose profound ignorance and boundless stupidity threaten our society.Read Post | CommentsTracy Christoph, 09/25/12JetBlue Flight AttendantJoin me as I take you on a virtual tour of the east coast from the south to the north, to check out my favorite fall foliage spots along the way!Read Post | CommentsJordan Schultz, 09/25/12The Huffington Post\u0027s sports columnist, The Schultz Report\"Protect the shield.\" -- That\u0027s what the NFL and its stone-faced commissioner Roger Goodell tell its players. After Monday night\u0027s debacle between Green Bay and Seattle, the NFL should be embarrassed by the product it put on the field.Read Post | Comments (24)Richard (RJ) Eskow, 09/24/12Writer; host, \u0027The Breakdown\u0027; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureMitt Romney\u0027s secret video showed that he shares the delusionally sheltered and narcissistic worldview of his ultra-wealthy peer group. Paul Ryan\u0027s recording reveals his radical hostility toward the nation\u0027s most popular social programs.Read Post | Comments (287)William D. Green, 09/25/12Executive Chairman, AccentureCharlie Kramer taught me when I was 19-years-old. His subject was economics -- and that is an incredibly hard subject to teach a 19-year-old. To teach a 59-year-old would still be hard!Read Post | CommentsPaul Loeb, 09/25/12Author, \u0027Soul of a Citizen\u0027 and \u0027The Impossible Will Take a Little While\u0027You\u0027ve heard it again and again. \"My vote doesn\u0027t matter,\" students too often say. Others complain that politicians are \"all the same and all corrupt.\" How do we overcome this cynical resignation and encourage students to register and vote despite their conviction that the game is fundamentally rigged?Read Post | Comments (20)Brian Frederick, 09/25/12Executive Director, SportsFans.orgJust how big is the fraud the NFL has been trying to sell the American public? So big that even its loyal business partner ESPN (and other media establishments) can no longer sit idly by without feeling compelled to point out the obvious.Read Post | CommentsTerry O\u0027Neill, 09/25/12President, National Organization for WomenIt\u0027s this kind of thinking that allows Romney and Ryan to initiate such a reckless attack on Medicaid. If the people you\u0027re hurting with your policies are blameworthy -- irresponsible loafers and swindlers who think they\u0027re entitled to health care, food, housing -- then it\u0027s ok to punish them, right?Read Post | Comments (202)Paul Brandeis Raushenbush, 09/25/12Senior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostWe need to leave off the \"savage\" language and the mindset that is behind it. Instead Americans need to double down on the strength of our country which is our commitment to pluralism and respect of the other.Read Post | Comments (237)Andrew Bacevich, 09/25/12Author, \u0027The Limits of Power: The End of American Exceptionalism\u0027The debate over who actually represents God\u0027s will is one that the both Bush and Obama have studiously sought to avoid. The U.S. is not at war with Islam per se, U.S. officials insist. Still, among Muslims abroad, suspicion persists and not without reason.Read Post | Comments (19)Rep. Maxine Waters, 09/25/12Congresswoman from California\u0027s 35th DistrictActions by the Fed can never offset the damage done by an obstructionist Congress. But by engaging in this next round of quantitative easing, the Fed anticipates that it can help shore up the housing market and improve business conditions for investment.Read Post | CommentsPeter S. Goodman, 09/24/12Business Editor, The Huffington PostAn emerging global elite is increasingly intent on amassing more than ever while writing the rules to ensure they hang on to as much as they can. This is the fundamental takeaway from Chrystia Freeland\u0027s important new book, Plutocrats: The Rise of the New Global Super-Rich and the Fall of Everyone Else.Read Post | Comments (497)Peter McGraw and Joel Warner, 09/25/12The Humor CodeWe traveled to Denmark to investigate the only cartoons ever to be called a human rights violation by the United Nations. We discovered a tale far more complex and surreal than we\u0027d ever imagined.Read Post | CommentsOscar Farinetti, 09/25/12President, EatalyLast week in Rome, we launched Vino Libero (free wine). But while we were developing our business plan for the project, we came to realize that it\u0027s not only wine that needs to be liberated.Read Post | CommentsCoco Khan, 2012.25.09Mike Collins, 2012.25.09Andy Robertson, 2012.25.09Dr Raj Persaud, 2012.25.09Sheila Hageman, 2012.25.09Ambi Sitham, 2012.25.09Mark Holweger, 2012.25.09Vincent Brogan, 2012.25.09Rupert Parker, 2012.25.09Larry Jaffee, 2012.25.09","h1":"N-F-aiLHuffpost Live",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in StyleYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalAOLConnect with your friendsMost Popular on HuffPostDon\u0027t Miss HuffPost Bloggers","h2":"Using a mobile device?
