{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"TED and HuffPost are planning an exciting experiment in the weeks ahead. We want to highlight some of today\u0027s most intriguing ideas. But to do so in a way that sees those ideas morph and develop in real time, in response to input from thousands of contributors, perhaps including you. Every weekend for the next year, we\u0027ll introduce a theme, anchored to a TEDTalk we think has at its core a powerful and timely concept. But rather than simply offering it up as is, we\u0027re opening it up to you to write your own post about it, leave a comment behind, and help refine it. Because that\u0027s the thing about ideas. They\u0027re not set in stone. When exposed to thoughtful people, each of whom may bring an additional insight, they\u0027re capable of adaptation until they find their most potent form. A form that can truly go viral and perhaps impact millions of minds.Read Post | Comments (16)Will.i.am, 11/02/12Musician, technology advocate, and creator/executive producer of i.am FIRST: ScienceI made a new song that\u0027s a reminder of what this election is all about... we are all fighting for a better life... we are all wanting greater opportunities... we are all looking for solutions... we are all hurting wishing and praying for \"Great Times.\"Read Post | CommentsBrian Goldman, MD, 10/15/12Author, \u0027The Night Shift\u0027Since January of this year, more than half a million people have seen my talk. A small number of people have (rightly) taken me to task for not doing better. But most have been incredibly supportive of my call for health professionals to talk openly about their mistakes.Read Post | Comments (191)Dr. Dean Ornish, 11/02/12Medical Editor, The Huffington Post; Founder and President, Preventive Medicine Research InstituteThe need for love and intimacy is a fundamental human need, as primal as the need for food, water, and air. Yet because of the breakdown of social networks in the past 25 years, this need often goes unfulfilled.Read Post | Comments (28)Dr. Patricia Fitzgerald, 11/02/12Wellness Editor, The Huffington Post; Doctor of acupuncture and Oriental medicine; Nutritionist; AuthorWe sometimes forget that those great minds in medicine live in a body -- a human body. Those bodies need restorative sleep, nourishing food, stable blood sugar, exercise, and time for connection, reflection, and community.Read Post | CommentsArianna Huffington, 11/02/12In the election issue of Huffington magazine this week, Dan Froomkin revisits some of the idealists who supported Barack Obama in 2008 and finds them \"chastened by the reality that Obama is a politician, not an activist.\" Elsewhere in the issue, Ben Hallman drills down on the foreclosure crisis, and Jon Ward puts the spotlight on the debate that gave new life to the floundering Romney campaign.Read Post | Comments (52)Robert Redford, 11/02/12Actor, director, and environmental activistIt will take resourcefulness and grit to reduce the carbon pollution that\u0027s fueling these storms, but Hurricane Sandy proves once again we have it. The question is: Will we use it?Read Post | CommentsJared Bernstein, 11/02/12Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorGiven the acceleration in payroll growth, the upward revisions to prior months payroll gains, the trend decline in unemployment, and the pick-up in labor force participation, today\u0027s report is generally pointing to job market that\u0027s showing signs of improvement.Read Post | Comments (165)Keith Thomson, 11/02/12Reporter and authorIn 2010, computer scientists from the University of Michigan and Princeton hacked a touch-screen voting machine, installing the video game Pac-Man. Could comparable voting systems in Ohio be subverted to alter the presidential vote tally?Read Post | CommentsNorman Lear, 11/02/12Founder, People for the American WayWhat will get me to my polling place this year, more than anything else, is this: I believe Barack Obama will nominate Supreme Court Justices who will vote to overturn Citizens United, which wiped out reasonable limits on campaign funding. And Mitt Romney would appoint Supreme Court Justices who would uphold it.Read Post | Comments (21)Nick Penniman, 11/02/12President, Fund for the RepublicIsn\u0027t there a moral obligation at a company like Fox News to use its primetime hours to cover a massive, tragic, still-breaking news story?Read Post | Comments (340)Oprah Winfrey, 11/01/12Chairman and CEO, Oprah Winfrey NetworkUnderstanding that we are all more powerful than we know -- that we are all connected to something bigger than ourselves -- is the real conversation I want to have in the new OWN section on HuffPost. In many ways, it is the only conversation, I believe, truly worth having.Read Post | Comments (322)Radley Balko, 11/02/12Senior Writer and Investigative Reporter, The Huffington PostThe Fourth Amendment is supposed to protect us from searches of our persons, residences, and property based on no more than the hunches, suspicions, or biases of a police officer. But drug dogs have become little more than a way of converting those hunches into probable cause.Read Post | Comments (121)Michael Roth, 11/02/12President, Wesleyan UniversityWhy are both candidates today so reluctant to call for service? Why do they continually appeal to our desire to have our country do something for us, but rarely ask that we make personal sacrifices to improve our collective future?Read Post | CommentsKathleen Turner, 11/02/12ActressIf we have Todd Akin and Richard Mourdock making laws about who can access contraception, and a Romney Supreme Court deciding what rights women are entitled to, we can all forget about the DeLorean. We\u0027re stuck.Read Post | Comments (82)Robert Scheer, 11/02/12Editor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027If Romney would just commit to granting all of us the same deal that he gets from his hedge fund and capital gains tax breaks and offshore accounts, I might be tempted to join the ranks of terminally shortsighted white males who seemed poised to vote him into office.Read Post | CommentsElliott Negin, 11/02/12Director of News \u0026 Commentary, Union of Concerned ScientistsThe biggest long-term threat to the U.S. economy isn\u0027t government over-regulation, high taxes, the deficit or even China--the issues candidates routinely cite. It\u0027s climate change.Read Post | CommentsDavid Jensen, 11/02/12Author, CEO of The Hiring AcademyA great deal can be said for the oft-repeated motto of the Boy Scouts of America: Be Prepared. Every area of life benefits from meticulous preparation, the quest for landing a good job included.Read Post | CommentsTom Zeller Jr., 11/01/12Senior Writer, The Huffington PostSome stakeholders view the disaster as evidence of climate change, while others say such storms might happen randomly anyway. At this stage of scientific understanding, it cannot be denied that the latter camp has a fair point. But with millions of Americans still lacking power, some climate experts suggest an equally fair retort would be, so what?Read Post | Comments (2,975)Marian Wright Edelman, 11/02/12President, Children\u0027s Defense Fund\"Something that I\u0027ve learned from my mentor is always pay things forward, not necessarily with money, but with actions and deeds. You\u0027re not alone. You\u0027re not the only one out there in a bad situation. Beat the odds and you\u0027ll succeed.\"Read Post | CommentsLizz Winstead, 11/02/12Co-creator, \u0027The Daily Show\u0027; Co-founder, Air America RadioIt is no one\u0027s business what reason a woman chooses to have an abortion, no woman should be defined by having one, or have her character called into question because she has had one, and under no circumstances, should she ever be asked why she had one.Read Post | Comments (601)Onkar Ghate, 11/02/12Senior fellow and vice president of intellectual leadership, The Ayn Rand InstituteInstead of liberals dismissing Rand\u0027s appeal to the American spirit of individualism and independence, as President Obama recently did in his Rolling Stone interview, why don\u0027t liberals make Rand part of a new canon? Why let conservatives monopolize her?Read Post | Comments (25)Richard (RJ) Eskow, 11/02/12Writer; host, \u0027The Breakdown\u0027; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureBehind Romney\u0027s sweet-sounding words is an ugly, ugly threat: elect me or we\u0027ll paralyze the government and shatter the economy. \"You know that if the president is reelected,\" Romney said, \"he will still be unable to work with the people in Congress.\"Read Post | CommentsJacob Soboroff, 11/02/12Host/Producer, HuffPost LiveThe United States is the world\u0027s most famous democracy, yet we rank near the bottom of all nations in voter turnout. So why, when U.S. Census data says most Americans don\u0027t vote because it\u0027s inconvenient, do we vote on Tuesday smack in the middle of the week?Read Post | Comments (61)Will Durst, 11/02/12Political comic, former radio talk show host, syndicated columnist, author, motivational speakerLooking for the dead solid skinny on the upcoming presidential election?
