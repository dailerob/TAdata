{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jason LinkinsEditor, Eat the PressIt is 2014 at the moment, but since there isn\u0027t any kind of massive unemployment problem and it\u0027s totally safe for pregnant women to drink the water, water, everywhere, the media are filling the hole in their lives with only the hottest speculation about the 2016 presidential election. For example, this week Time magazine is tackling the phenomenon that is Hillary Clinton\u0027s shadow campaign for president, noting that the mere threat of her candidacy is keeping other Democrats out of the race. This is less a \"news story\" than it is a fun and bouncy ball that is being passed from news organization to news organization. Time all but announced the unoriginality of the idea with its cover, which was created by going to a clip art archive and doing a global search for \"women\" and \"clichés.\" As with the story\u0027s trope itself, it\u0027s best examined in the gray light of the afterglow of an afterthought.Comments (58)TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"Forget broken bones in doctor\u0027s offices and suitcases at the airport. Artist Nick Veasey turns his x-ray machine on the whole world, and these pictures will make you see it in an entirely new way.CommentsMerton BernsteinColes Professor of Law Emeritus, Washington UniversityPresident Obama\u0027s proposal that Congress authorize \"outside government\" public advocates is doubly useless: (1) Congress legislates almost nothing; and (2) such advocates would be too slow and limited to provide balance between intelligence needs and constitutional protections. The FISA Court can provide the rules.CommentsDr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarCongratulations. Elvis didn\u0027t make it this far. Here is a random list of personal thoughts in the measure and meaning of a half century on the planet.CommentsDirk HughesCollege registrar in Western MichiganMy story is not unique. It may be surprising, but it is not unique. I have a doctorate. I have been employed full-time for 35 years with only a week or so between jobs. I have worked my butt off my entire adult life. I do not have a drinking or gambling problem. And I still live paycheck to paycheck.Comments (541)Laura CarrollNonfiction Author \u0026 Communications ConsultantIt\u0027s time to stop going round and round with the \"who\u0027s happier\" question when it comes to those with and without kids. It\u0027s not one group versus the other. It boils down to how we define happiness in the first place for ourselves.CommentsKia MakarechiSenior Editor for Mobile and Innovations, The Huffington PostThe thing is, people have actually always been upset about the issues that are enraging them now. The only difference is that the person making the above statement is now interacting with perspectives outside their immediate community and is being exposed to what are almost always longstanding grievances of minority communities.CommentsRobert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, Beyond OutrageFor years political scientists have wondered why so many working class and poor citizens of so-called \"red\" states vote against their economic self-interest. The usual explanation is that, for these voters, economic issues are trumped by social and cultural issues like guns, abortion, and race. I\u0027m not so sure.Comments (506)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027As I have followed the reports coming from Central African Republic, I am heartbroken over the suffering of a people the world seems to have forgotten. Since the Seleka, or alliance, rebellion overturned the government in March 2013, there has been widespread insecurity and chaos. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has called the situation a \"mega-crisis.\"CommentsJack MirkinsonMedia Editor, The Huffington PostIronically, it was a scene with no men in it that reminded me how bored I am with movies about men.Comments (26)Inae OhAssociate Editor, HuffPost NYJust because Dunham is a young feminist who speaks confidently about her \"real body\" does not mean we get to qualify her statements with an inappropriate cash prize.Comments (34)Geoffrey DunnAuthor, \u0027The Lies of Sarah Palin\u0027Sometimes all you can do is shake your head in disgust at the insipid tendencies of the Christian Science Monitor\u0027s national political coverage.Comments (29)Clive DavisRecord producerRather than shrug it off as another expected Streep tour de force, marvel at the ability of this remarkable actress to touch you and affect your emotions like no one else.CommentsGary MayProfessor of History, University of DelawareNearly 50 years after his death it is King\u0027s words and deeds that live on in the American memory -- not that of the racists who hated him or the Black Power advocates who scorned him.CommentsMichael KimmelAuthorWe need to help men reduce the power of that gender policing -- the fear that other men will see us as less than manly if we listen to the voices in our own hearts about how we want to live our lives.CommentsRebecca SmithDeputy Director, National Employment Law ProjectThe recent story of an Indian diplomat in New York arrested for labor abuses garnered national headlines, but the mistreatment suffered by her domestic worker employee barely received a mention.CommentsBob CescaManaging Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowThere will only be more Curtis Reeves cases and more George Zimmerman cases. All because we\u0027ve been conditioned to believe that the law and the Constitution is on the side of the well-armed, heroic shooter, and very seldom on the side of the victim.Comments (735)Adam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; co-founder of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911How would you cope if the tax refund you were counting on, and were counting the days until you received, just never showed up? How freaked out would you be if you found that it was sent to another address instead?CommentsSen. Richard Blumenthal and Sen. Dick DurbinProposed laws that would regulate e-cigarettes are met with opposition from those who dismiss e-cigarettes as products that present little or no risk. They claim e-cigarettes are a great way for smokers to quit smoking without exposing innocent bystanders to hazardous vapor. What they don\u0027t tell you is the impact that e-cigarettes are having on people who have never smoked before.CommentsMichael RosenblumVideo producer, Founder of Current TVVeasey has taken a very high-tech field, in which he is an expert, radiography, and turned it into an artform in its own right. What makes it so compelling is that through the use of what was designed as a \u0027functional technology\u0027, he alters the way that we see the world.CommentsJoseph A. PalermoProfessor, historian, authorFrom the time he was first elected New Jersey governor in 2010, the corporate media gave mad love to Chris Christie. He was a \"new\" kind of Republican and possibly the next president of the United States. And then: Poof!Comments (39)William AstoreWriter, Professor, Retired Lt. Colonel, Air ForceChristie wants authority without personal responsibility. He\u0027s quick to hold others responsible but not himself. He equivocates when he should be unequivocal.Comments (11)Timothy KarrCampaign Director, Free Press and SavetheInternet.comTuesday\u0027s court decision stripped the agency of any ability to protect Net Neutrality and stop companies from blocking websites and degrading Internet access. In the few days since a consensus has begun to emerge: To protect the open Internet, the agency must reclassify broadband access as a telecommunications service.CommentsFaisal HoqueEntrepreneur | AuthorI believe our minds have an enormous capacity to connect the invisible dots to guide us to strive for the impossible. This ability to connect the dots comes from mindfully visualizing our path.CommentsCherno JobateyEditorial Director, HuffPost DeutschlandJanet Yellen is a professional politician in every sense. She is definitely not your old university kind of economist who can speak only in numbers and statistics.CommentsSteve CichonWriter, historian and \"retired\" radio newsman in Buffalo, NYThere are 15 electronic gimzo type items on the page, being sold from America\u0027s Technology Store. 13 of the 15 you now always have in your pocket.Comments (113)Earl Ofari HutchinsonAuthor and political analystThe blind eye, indifference or even out right disrespect of the King holiday 28 years after the first was officially observed shouldn\u0027t really surprise. It took decades and hard battles to get the King federal holiday bill enacted in the first place.CommentsSir Michael BarberChief education officer, PearsonWhile America\u0027s preeminence in both elite and mass institutions of higher learning fueled its economic leadership in the last century, that preeminence (and the rising generation\u0027s standard of living) is at risk unless the sector overhauls its traditional practices to lower costs while lifting quality.CommentsGov. Jack MarkellGovernor of DelawareOur at-risk students need our support and we need them to make it as far as they can go. The country\u0027s economic competitiveness, and our promise of economic opportunity for all Americans, depends on it.CommentsArin GreenwoodEditor, HuffPost DCWhat if our lives get boring without kids? What if we have no one to hang out with once everyone we love has little ones, then bigger ones, to look after? What if one day I\u0027m in the hospital recovering from cancer surgery and I don\u0027t have anyone to make sure the nurses are taking good care of me?CommentsDouglas Anthony CooperNovelist, AmnesiaTo have it suggested that you are in favor of puppy mills is about as ugly an accusation as you encounter in the world of animal rights or welfare: it is saying that you are in favor of the criminal abuse of animals.Comments (13)Mark Morford, 2014.17.01D.
