{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jason LinkinsEditor, Eat the PressAs the 2014 midterms approach, the billionaire industrialists and politically conservative uber-donors known as the Koch Brothers continue to loom large in our political discourse. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has famously targeted Charles and David Koch with his ire, and prominent Democrats have labored to cast the pair as the King Bad Boogeymen of the post-Citizens United era. And while this effort has birthed some unintended consequences, it\u0027s not been a purposeless endeavor: As Dave Weigel reported back in March, Democratic fundraising emails that mention the Kochs tend to yield a good deal more loot than those that don\u0027t. So, for better or for worse, Koch Industries will continue to be a flashpoint for all manner of political rows. But if it\u0027s not too much to ask, can we all make sure that we\u0027re talking about the right Koch Industries?Now, I\u0027m not a Brian Williams hater. I think he\u0027s a fine news anchor. But his interview with Ed Snowden was yet another in a long, long line of deferential, uninformed, unchallenging genuflections before a guy whose story and motivations are more than a little specious.Bob CescaManaging Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowChinese artist Liu Bolin can disappear into everything from famous landmarks to the rows of instant noodles at the supermarket. The question is: Why? By going invisible, what does he help you see?TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"The main message coming from my book, Capital in the Twenty-first Century, is not that there should always be a deterministic trend toward ever rising inequality (I do not believe in this); the main message is that we need more democratic transparency about wealth dynamics, so that we are able to adjust our institutions and policies to whatever we observe.Thomas PikettyAuthor, \u0027Capital in the Twenty-First Century\u0027To know that there is finally a light at the end of the tunnel, and it\u0027s not an oncoming train -- it becomes a refilling of hope, a refilling of belief in our justice system.Raymond SantanaYusef SalaamWhat you\u0027re about to read is a terrible story that I feel conflicted about telling. I\u0027m sharing it now, in part, because I think it has something to add to the ongoing conversation about sex, violence and entitlement, and also because I hope it will help someone else make better choices than I did.Carol HartsellSenior Comedy Editor, The Huffington PostNetanyahu can be seen as a maneuverer, but in reality, he is an ideologue, relentless in his efforts to maintain control of what he refers to as Judea and Samaria. He will feint to the left or right, as need be, but the key to understanding him is to judge him by his actions, not his words.James ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027This is a most troubling event for speech, the web and Europe. The court has trampled the free-speech rights not only of Google but of the sites -- and speakers -- to which it links.Jeff JarvisAuthor, \u0027Public Parts\u0027 and \u0027What Would Google Do?\u0027Someday, maybe 12 years from now, they think, all children will be college-ready, even if they live in squalor or have no home, even if they attend overcrowded classes with inexperienced teachers. Are they gullible? Or do they believe the public can be easily deceived?Diane RavitchResearch Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027Diet-Soda sales are in free fall. The beverage industry sees the writing on the wall. It\u0027s not hard to find a credible-sounding research institution that\u0027s short on funding. That\u0027s most of them.Laurie DavidStephanie SoechtigOne story risks being buried among all this other newsworthy stuff, and that is the vote which happened late last night in the House of Representatives.Chris WeigantPolitical writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comThere will be bad bosses -- male and female. There will also be good bosses -- male and female. College graduates considering choosing a boss based on perception only serves to reinforce certain stereotypes.Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarDon\u0027t march alone. Join the procession. Find yourself a Maya to march behind and then Be a Maya for a woman marching behind you. That\u0027s how this mighty, sacred sisterhood keeps marching on.Glennon MeltonBestselling Author, Carry On, Warrior and Founder of MomasteryTwo-thirds of the people sensibly think the economy is on the wrong track. And Republican prospects to capture the majority of the Senate and consolidate their hold on the House look increasingly bright. But Americans are dealing with stagnant pay, lousy jobs, and young people moving back home because they can\u0027t afford anything else.Robert L. BorosagePresident, Institute for America\u0027s FutureWe are citizens of a country that does not yet exist, but it is up to us to finally create and make it a just and hopeful land for all.Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundObama spoke of defending the homeland and the American way of life (who could disagree with that?) and waxed eloquently about the virtues of democracy. But he offered no compelling interpretation of what we should be doing in the world, how, where, why, for how long, and at what cost.Rajan MenonSpitzer Professor of Political Science, Colin Powell School, City College of New York/City University of New York; Non Resident Senior Fellow, The Atlantic CouncilCan President Obama seize the opportunity to initiate and catalyze real change -- meaning transforming the systemic incompetence and corruption at VA and creating a culture that supports the many employees whose dedicated, skillful and innovative efforts have gone unsupported or undermined, and, most importantly, a culture that remembers every day and is responsive in word and deed to the veterans it serves?Joseph BobrowFounder and president, Coming Home ProjectOn Monday, Obama will announce new rules to reduce carbon pollution from power plants. One might be tempted to think this is just a boring old regulatory matter. But the ramifications are huge, and not just for the climate. This announcement portends a whopping new jobs opportunity for the countryGov. Jennifer M. GranholmFormer Governor of Michigan, Senior Research Fellow at UC Berkeley\u0027s Energy and Climate Institute, and Co-chair of Priorities USA ActionI see the ACA\u0027s positive impact first-hand in my home state, a place whose collective poor health has long been jeopardizing the lives and financial security of hard-working families who can\u0027t seem to get ahead.Gov. Steve BeshearGovernor of KentuckyYou should beware of those pundits today who disparage creating greater access to a college education. Under the guise of practicality, this is old-fashioned, elitist condescension combined with a desire to protect the status quo of inequality.Michael RothPresident, Wesleyan UniversityInstead of realizing her complexity, I fear that the things that made her great are being lost through softened eulogies. In order to really understand who Maya Angelou was, you would have to understand the tenets of her imperfections and the nuances of her limitations and how that, in turn, influenced her convictions.Steven-Emmanuel MartinezPrograms assistant, AVAC: Global Advocacy for HIV Prevention; Proud alumnus of Hampshire CollegeAre you ever discouraged when friends or loved ones say disparaging things about immigrants? You know that if you could just get them to hear the stories of hardworking people who love God, their communities, and their families that you just might be able to get them to change their mind?Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersIt\u0027s tempting to spend most of your time hanging out with friends and family. But if you use the next three months wisely, they can make a big difference in getting your undergraduate career off to a strong start.Marvin KrislovPresident, Oberlin CollegeAs America becomes more multicultural, many corporations have begun taking a total market approach when trying to reach consumers, rather than looking at distinct cultural attributes of multicultural segments. This, according to my guests, is leading to the decline of long-standing black agencies.Tavis SmileyPBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorIt\u0027s as if fossil fuel companies are looking young people in the eye and saying: \"We don\u0027t care if you have a better future. We want to keep polluting the air and destabilizing the climate.\"Frances BeineckePresident, NRDCSpeaking as a Christian pastor, I attest that following Jesus is difficult enough without having to live down the advanced billing from folks like Franklin Graham, who are convinced that God has nothing better to do than to figure out new categories of people to despise.Derek PenwellAuthor; Editor; Speaker; ActivistIt\u0027s interesting to see how some have foolishly engaged in a debate about why Snowden has not \"come home to face the music.\" What does that mean? he should come home and go to jail? Are we romanticizing and putting nobility on being locked up? Really?Davey DOakland resident, social justice avocate, adjunct professor, host of \u0027Hard Knock Radio\u0027 94.1 FMSpecies are going extinct at a pace not seen in tens of millions of years, and unlike past extinction events, the cause is us.Noah GreenwaldEndangered species program director, Center for Biological DiversityGoogle just revealed that 17 percent of its technology staff is female. That is impressive compared with the rest of Silicon Valley, but not once you put it in the context of the available pool of female computer scientists.Vivek WadhwaAcademic, Researcher, Writer, EntrepreneurThe death of American poet Maya Angelou has been greeted with both grief and accolades for her contributions to the American literary canon. But it also has stirred memories of her early support for a controversial man, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.Phillip MartinSr. Investigative Reporter WGBH Radio Boston; Sr. Fellow Schuster Institute for Investigative Journalism, Executive Editor Lifted Veils ProductionsCrossFit seems to think that the more pain you are in, whether on that day or the days following the workout, the better.
