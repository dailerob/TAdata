{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This was the week of the Big Snub. In Hollywood, Oscar voters turned their backs on Ben Affleck and Kathryn Bigelow, long considered locks for a Best Director nomination for their work on Argo and Zero Dark Thirty respectively. In Cooperstown, steroid era superstars Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens and Sammy Sosa were snubbed for the Baseball Hall of Fame -- along with the entire rest of the eligible field. The question now is, will snub fever make its way to Washington? Will Chuck Hagel, and the fresh ideas he\u0027d bring to the Pentagon, be snubbed? How about the gun proposals Joe Biden will be announcing on Tuesday? And will Jack Lew, President Obama\u0027s pick for Treasury Secretary, continue that department\u0027s long tradition of snubbing Main Street in favor of Wall Street? It\u0027s a reminder that what is rejected is often more important than what it selected. Especially in Hollywood and D.C.Read Post | CommentsOprah Winfrey, 01/05/13Chairman and CEO, Oprah Winfrey NetworkNo matter what you\u0027re struggling through -- no matter the pain or anguish -- you can go inside behind your mind and observe it happening to you. Whatever it is, it isn\u0027t you. You are the observer. When you come to know this, you realize that even though the canvas of your life is painted with daily experiences, behaviors, reactions, and emotions, you\u0027re the one controlling the brush.Read Post | Comments (104)Geoffrey R. Stone, 01/09/13Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoIt is time for opponents of gun control to stop mindlessly shouting \"The Second Amendment!!\" as if that ends the discussion. It does not. Just as there is no First Amendment right to falsely yell fire in a crowded theatre, there is no Second Amendment right to carry an AK-47 there.Read Post | Comments (4,833)Arianna Huffington, 01/07/13The main elements of this perfect storm are disruptive technology, our dysfunctional health care system, and the growing desire people have to take control of their own health and well-being. And it\u0027s powered by our growing awareness of the destructive power and tremendous cost of stress in our lives.Read Post | Comments (73)Sen. Bernie Sanders, 01/09/13Independent U.S. Senator from VermontDespite such terminology as \"fiscal cliff\" and \"debt ceiling,\" the great debate taking place in Washington now has relatively little to do with financial issues. It is all about ideology. It is all about economic winners and losers in American society.Read Post | Comments (879)Amy Cuddy, 01/11/13Professor, Harvard Business SchoolIt\u0027s not uncommon for people to overvalue the importance of demonstrating their competence and power, often at the expense of demonstrating their warmth. People judge trustworthiness before competence.Read Post | Comments (174)Robert Redford, 01/08/13Actor, director and environmental activistA long-awaited study by the Environmental Protection Agency has confirmed that the Pebble Mine -- along with its estimated 10 billion tons of mining waste -- would spell disaster for Bristol Bay, its legendary salmon runs, its pristine environment and its people.Read Post | Comments (211)Marian Wright Edelman, 01/11/13President, Children\u0027s Defense FundNow is the time to free ourselves from the plague of gun violence which has taken over 1.3 million American lives since Dr. King and Robert Kennedy\u0027s assassinations in 1968. This is twice the loss of life than all American battle casualties in all the major wars we have fought since our nation began.Read Post | Comments (1,228)Dan Froomkin, 01/09/13Contributing editor, Nieman ReportsDo yourself a favor, and don\u0027t go see Zero Dark Thirty. Don\u0027t encourage film-making that at best offers ambiguity about torture, and at worst endorses it. Spend the two and a half hours and the $10 on something more valuable, and moral.Read Post | Comments (1,074)Marlo Thomas, 01/11/13Award-winning actress, author and activistI love Tina Fey and Amy Poehler and I love watching the Golden Globes -- by far the most fun of all awards shows.

We\u0027re talking about a fight between human beings and physics. And physics is entirely uninterested in human timetables.Read Post | Comments (527)Valerie Jarrett, 01/07/13Senior Advisor and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsChuck Hagel is uniquely qualified to be Secretary of Defense. He is a decorated war hero who earned two purple hearts for his heroism in Vietnam. He knows the sacrifices that we ask our brave service members to make because he has made them himself.Read Post | Comments (120)Glenn D. Braunstein, M.D., 01/11/13Vice President of Clinical Innovation, at Cedars-SinaiThis time of colds, ear and sinus infections and influenza can provide a reason for each of us, as individuals, to look at our own health and healthcare and see how our small choices play a role in contributing to the burgeoning, unsustainable costs of U.S. medicine.Read Post | Comments (13)Lisa Belkin, 01/11/13Senior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, The Huffington PostI\u0027ve spent decades trying to live the balanced message that I want my children to hear.

The message: It\u0027s fine if boys want to go around wearing sparkly nail polish as kids, as long as they grow up to be big and strong and macho.Read Post | Comments (163)Melinda Gates, 01/09/13Co-chair, the Bill and Melinda Gates FoundationThe focus of our education strategy in recent years has centered on helping teachers do their best work. We\u0027re working on this challenge from many angles and with many partners, including teachers themselves.

Louie Giglio, the Atlanta pastor who was going to pray at President Barack Obama\u0027s inauguration but came under fire for an anti-gay sermon, has bowed out, conservative Christians and evangelicals ask: are they welcome in the public square?Read Post | Comments (2,935)Lesli Johnson, 01/11/13Marriage and Family Therapist specializing in adoption-related issuesI was adopted as an infant, during a time when adoption was still shrouded in secrecy.

NFL players frequently turn in positive drug tests and the sports media doesn\u0027t so much as flinch.Read Post | Comments (54)Bob Cesca, 01/09/13Political Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowYes, Chris Christie is a moderate on marriage equality. In a hardlined Republican crowd, that\u0027s rare. He\u0027s also acknowledged the man-made causes of the climate crisis. Good for him, but how screwy is it that we have to give credit to people who simply acknowledge scientific facts?Read Post | Comments (466)Jermaine Spradley, 01/11/13Multicultural Editor, The Huffington PostOne of the more interesting, though hardly unexpected developments to accompany Django Unchained\u0027s release has been the peculiar predicament it has created for blacks who like to think of themselves as progressive or forward-thinking.Read Post | Comments (95)William K. Black, 01/10/13Assoc. Professor, Univ. of Missouri, Kansas City; Sr. regulator during S\u0026L debacleObama likes to surround himself with failures. Geithner set the pattern. He was supposed to be the principal regulator of most of the largest U.S. bank holding companies. He was an abject failure. Lew has gone from failure to failure. He was one of the architects of both of the Clinton administration\u0027s disastrous statutory deregulatory actions that helped produce the epidemic of accounting control fraud that drove the Great Recession.Read Post | Comments (531)Bernard-Henri Lévy, 01/08/13French philosopher and writerThe gay marriage debate has taken an odd and worrisome turn. The truth is that the opponents of gay marriage are finding it increasingly difficult to conceal the homophobia that skews their views.Read Post | Comments (286)James Zogby, 01/12/13President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027What is at stake for Republicans is far more than just Israel and Iran. It is the entire neo-conservative enterprise that led the U.S. into two failed wars in Afghanistan and Iraq (which they cannot admit were failures) and has them still advocating for more aggressive military engagements in Syria and Iran.Read Post | Comments (97)Arianna Huffington, 2013.13.01Jordan Schultz, 2013.12.01Carla Buzasi, 2013.12.01Nancy K.
