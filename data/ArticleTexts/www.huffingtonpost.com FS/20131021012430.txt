{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week saw disaster averted when, at the last possible moment, Congress voted to reopen the government and extend the debt ceiling. Of course, we actually only avoided extreme disaster -- allowing us to return to the ordinary, run-of-the-mill disaster that is the current sequester-hobbled budget. It\u0027s like living in a house that\u0027s falling apart and celebrating because you convinced the repairman not to burn it down. But even avoided catastrophes can be pricey: since 2010, these politically-manufactured crises have cost us 3 percent of GDP, 900,000 jobs and $700 billion in lost economic activity -- not including the $24 billion this latest circus cost. And now we get to see if Congress, so eager to pat itself on the back for not driving the world economy over the cliff, can at long last get its act together -- or if we\u0027ll have to go through the exasperating brink-of-disaster routine all over again in three months.Comments (109)Ron CebikPsychotherapist and TeacherThe breakdown of government is not due to the failure of public policy or the conflicting policies of partisan factions in the body politic. It is due, to a great extent, to factors under the radar of both popular media and sophisticated or academic thinking.CommentsMohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOWhat emerged from Congress on Wednesday speaks to stop-gap measures born of exhaustion and political miscalculations, and prompted by national (and global) outrage.Comments (187)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundMontgomery County achieved many of its successful outcomes for its graduating seniors by deciding from the beginning where they wanted their students to end up as they entered adulthood, and working backwards to build the right path from their earliest years.Comments (37)Dylan RatiganNew York Times Best-Selling author, entrepreneur and formerly the host of MSNBC\u0027s The Dylan Ratigan ShowPower, whether in an electoral system or a corporate boardroom, originates with the people who control the nomination of candidates -- not with those who \"vote\" after this process is complete. The more nominees voters can choose from, the more diverse the actual choices become.Comments (101)Arianna HuffingtonIn this week\u0027s issue, we look at youth unemployment on an international scale, putting the spotlight on a problem that threatens economic growth and social stability in dozens of countries.Comments (125)Eric IdleEnglish comedian, Monty PythonCurrently you appear to be almost in a state of civil war. If one party can shut down the government, then the social compact to rule is broken. In most other democracies this simply could not happen.Comments (1,308)Adam OckelfordProfessor of Music, University of RoehamptonDerek\u0027s capacity to reason and to use language is in the bottom 0.05 percent of the population. Yet his capacity to process musical sound is in the top 99.99 percent: actually, the best I\u0027ve ever encountered, even among advanced performers.Comments (112)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarThe conversation quickly moved off of weight and healthy eating and the \"awareness of obesity\" Kang says she was trying to raise. Instead, many women -- moms in particular -- used the photo as evidence of Kang\u0027s shoddy dedication as a mother, as if tight abs leads to neglected children.Comments (92)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027Watching the dysfunction in Washington over the past two weeks has been painful. But after the storm comes the promise -- the hope of lessons learned and new ways forward togetherComments (14)Roseanne BarrPresidential Candidate, Peace and Freedom PartyIt took a lot of courage for me to stand almost completely alone in the face of corporate witch-burning terrorism, class attack, and voracious sexist censorship waged against me, from which I have never, and will never fully recover.Comments (129)Lemony SnicketAuthorFrom time to time people say to me, \"Lemony Snicket, you write dreadful and shocking books. What sort of writing do you find dreadful and shocking yourself?\"Comments (438)Rep. Debbie Wasserman SchultzAuthor, \u0027For the Next Generation\u0027; Chair, Democratic National CommitteeNearly all of the Tea Party lawmakers elected in 2010 had signed a document in which the signer forsakes one of the most sacrosanct responsibilities of his office: their independence to use their judgment to make the best decision to ensure the welfare of the American people.Comments (253)April McCormickFreelance Writer, Author and Blogger.\"First Time Mom \u0026 Dad\"After observing my toddler, and talking with other parents of toddlers, I am convinced that toddlers have the following Code of Conduct hardwired into their DNA.Comments (66)Niels Gerson LohmanWriter, designer, musicianI have been cursed at a Chinese border. In Dubai, my passport was studied by three veiled women for over an hour and my suitcase completely dismembered. In the Philippines I had to bribe someone in order to get my visa extended for a few days. But never, ever, will I return to the United States of America.Comments (4,929)Petra CollinsArtist, photographer, writerRecently I had my Instagram account deleted. I did nothing that violated the terms of use. No nudity, violence, pornography, unlawful, hateful, or infringing imagery.

But the fight will continue. He mustn\u0027t relinquish ground during the upcoming cease-fire.Comments (726)Rielle HunterAuthor, \u0027In Hindsight, What Really Happened: The Revised Edition: John Edwards, Our Daughter and Me\u0027I behaved badly. That may seem obvious to you but it\u0027s taken me a long time to admit that, even to myself. For years I was so viciously attacked by the media and the world that I felt like a victim. I now realize that the attacks are actually beside the point. The point is: I behaved badly.Comments (313)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkYes, a man waved a Confederate flag in front of the home of an African-American family. And the elected officials who organized, spoke, marched or promoted this rally are just as responsible as that man for this ugly display of bigotry.Comments (607)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistI have always prided myself on being the optimistic sort, confident that there is no challenge that can\u0027t be met in some way. I\u0027ve always felt that nothing is impossible. But I have to confess that it is hard to feel hopeful about the bullying epidemic in this nation, not when it continues to take kids\u0027 lives.Comments (26)Norman LearFounder, People for the American WayTo your knowledge has anyone ever exploded, you know, burst apart, like if we humans had seams, and once in a great while someone just bursts open and guts and sh*t shoot out in every direction? Has that ever happened to anyone you have ever known or heard of?Comments (364)Jennifer MeerMother and writer at my-jenneration.blogspot.comWe live in an age where we are constantly fed messages that we should try to do as much as we can as fast as we can; to live at maximum efficiency. Except when we shouldn\u0027t. Sometimes I feel like we are multi-tasking ourselves right past the point of it all anyway.Comments (143)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorThere is another story about how all this gridlock came to be, fronted by the question: \"Why didn\u0027t the Democrats landslide the cruelest, most ignorant, big-business-indentured Republican Party in its history during the 2010 and 2012 Congressional elections?Comments (341)Claire FallonDeputy Blog Editor, The Huffington PostOur national preoccupation with the concept is somewhat odd -- no other country seems to share this need to score ambitious new novels by whether it\u0027s a \"Great _____ Novel contender.\"Comments (36)Bob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowWhen tea party lawmakers stand on National Park Service land and exploit a NPS monument as a backdrop in their strategy to undermine the U.S. economy, it tends to ring hollow knowing how the GOP has been at war against funding for the NPS.Comments (1,060)Alex PalomboOnline Strategist, Democracy PartnersRight after Wendy Davis declared that she was running for governor, Texas Republicans set out to disenfranchise women from voting, 19th Amendment be damned.
