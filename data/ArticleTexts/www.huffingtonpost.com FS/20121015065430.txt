Professor, Univ. of Missouri, Kansas City; Sr. regulator during S\u0026L debacleIt\u0027s a good thing that Ryan doesn\u0027t really have a secret plan to reduce the budget deficit, because it would cost millions of Americans their jobs by throwing us into a recession or depression.Read Post | Comments (32)Shura Lopez-Beale, 10/14/12College student and advocate for minority issuesI was filling out an application the other day.
