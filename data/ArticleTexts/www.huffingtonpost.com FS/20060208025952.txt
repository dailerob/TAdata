{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"From news.yahoo.comFor further evidence of why Democrats should be falling in behind Jack Murtha and making him the point man for nationalizing the \u002706 elections, look no further than the editorial page of the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. After steadfastly deriding Murtha\u0027s call for immediately withdrawal, the conservative daily, fast on the heels of Murtha\u0027s appearance on \"60 Minutes,\" did an abrupt 180 and offered a ringing endorsement of his plan. What makes this so significant is not the Tribune-Review\u0027s reach (circulation 102,000) but its provenance. It\u0027s part of a seven-paper chain that is published -- and controlled -- by Richard Mellon Scaife, the arch-conservative icon who has donated so much money to conservative causes and institutions that the Washington Post dubbed him the \"Funding Father of the Right.\"Spying and Lying: A Winning Issue for Dems... If They Stay StrongREAD POST | comments (34)02.07.2006 Seth GreenlandI never thought I would see the words \"deadly\" and \"cartoon\" juxtaposed in a sentence that didn\u0027t also have the words \"Monty Python\" in it. Truly, when you think the world can get no nuttier, suddenly it does.READ POST | comments (14)02.07.2006 Patt MorrisonIt\u0027s wonderful that Attorney General Alberto Gonzales has a lively imagination, and more wonderful still that he shared it with United States Senators.READ POST | comments (20)02.07.2006 RJ EskowWhich politicians are not \"loyal to the troops in Iraq\"? And if \"[Hillary] is now regarded\" as appropriately loyal, who\u0027s doing the regarding - and keeping score on politicians and their loyalty?READ POST | comments (14)02.07.2006 Katrina vanden HeuvelPerhaps, Mr. Mehlman, Hillary Clinton is onto something. I think there are a lot of citizens who are mad as hell about what\u0027s happening to a nation they love.READ POST | comments (39)02.07.2006 Harry ShearerLouisiana State Sen.

Crude satires that they were, the right to create them should be defended.READ POST | comments (27)02.07.2006 Trey EllisThe nation is a gas-guzzling Hummer that Bush has driven off the road into a muddy ditch. It\u0027s not enough to sit in the backseat and carp about his bad driving.READ POST | comments (13)02.07.2006 Jonah PerettiThe Contagious Festival is in full swing but it is still far from clear who will win the People\u0027s Choice Award. Right now a rapping ostrich is in the lead, and a spoof on wire tapping is a strong second.READ POST | comments02.07.2006 Bob CescaYou should know that electronic communication didn\u0027t exist during Washington\u0027s presidency. Neither did electric power. Or a war. Thought I\u0027d save you the embarrassment. Especially you IT professionals.READ POST | comments (61)02.07.2006 Robert SchlesingerBy citing the terrorist reaction, Alberto Gonzales implicitly validates it. The al Qaeda operatives are shaking their little evil-doer heads, he\u0027s saying, and they\u0027re right -- this display is weakening us.READ POST | comments (23)02.07.2006 Susan SmalleyWe suffer from a blindness of sorts, a blindness perhaps best described by \u0027blinders\u0027, blinders that narrow our view of ourselves and the world around us.
