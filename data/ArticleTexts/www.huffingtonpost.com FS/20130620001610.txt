{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThe biggest movie of the summer isn\u0027t Man of Steel, or The Lone Ranger, or Fast \u0026 Furious 6. It\u0027s a new documentary called How to Make Money Selling Drugs, and it exposes the hypocrisy, insanity, and destructiveness of America\u0027s drug war. Now, when I say \"biggest,\" I\u0027m not talking about budget size or box office receipts -- I\u0027m talking impact and importance. Of course, the problem with saying a movie is \"important\" is that it can leave the impression that it isn\u0027t entertaining. That\u0027s certainly not the case with this film. But the reason the film truly feels like a blockbuster is that you can\u0027t leave the theater without being shocked and outraged by what you\u0027ve seen. Even if you go in feeling like you\u0027re well-versed in the insanity of the drug war, you\u0027ll walk out stunned -- by the cowardice and hypocrisy of our elected leaders, and by the staggering consequences in lives and money.CommentsRobert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027It\u0027s as if they didn\u0027t learn a thing from 2012. Republicans are on the same suicide mission as before -- trying to block immigration reform, roll back the clock on abortion rights, and stop gay marriage wherever possible.Comments (764)Katharine FraseCTO, IBM Global Public SectorPeople say they\u0027d like to influence or actively participate in their local government. In fact, according to a Civic Plus Digital Citizen Engagement survey, nearly half of those polled want to provide input in their municipal government. But turning this interest into action is one of the biggest roadblocks to implementing local community ideas. How can local municipalities tap into the increasing power of social and mobile technologies to create a community of active influencers?CommentsWill BunchAuthor, \u0027Tear Down This Myth\u0027In both Turkey and Brazil, it has been the reckless brutality of the security forces -- captured on smartphones and broadcast to a whole world that\u0027s watching -- that has caused the protests to grow. Will the United States go down the same road?Comments (253)Melissa SherWriter and blogger, Mammalingo.comJust like famous folks have to put up with their share of difficulties (Gwyneth Paltrow told USA Today the Met Ball was soooo hot and crowded this year), pregnant women have to put up with some common annoyances too. Ours come in the form of people.Comments (57)Fred RichAuthor, \u0027Christian Nation\u0027A fanatical fundamentalist minority is a dangerous thing in any culture, and even the strongest democracy can become vulnerable when buffeted by economic distress and external shocks, such as major terrorist attacks.Comments (295)Nina BahadurAssistant Editor, HuffPost WomenI feel for Miss Utah. I can\u0027t imagine what it\u0027s like to have millions of people on the Internet discussing what an idiot you are and saying it\u0027s a good thing you\u0027re pretty since your brains won\u0027t get you far. Here are four reasons we should just leave her alone.Comments (54)Martha BurkMoney Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsHouse Speaker John Boehner told reporters the GOP\u0027s abortion ban that passed the House 228-196 on Tuesday won\u0027t change the party\u0027s relationship with women. He\u0027s half right. It won\u0027t change the party\u0027s relationship with women, because women already hate the GOP.Comments (438)FoodbeastGone are the days of dirtying piles of cups, crying over spilled milk, and failed attempts to fit your cookie into an uncooperative glass.CommentsMelinda GatesCo-chair, the Bill and Melinda Gates FoundationWhen Germany and other wealthy nations came together to create the Global Fund a decade ago, AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria were leading causes of death in developing countries. But world leaders recognized that they could make dramatic gains against these three diseases.CommentsEric BoehlertSenior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaThere\u0027s been surprisingly little media discussion about whether Chicago\u0027s strict gun laws, routinely ridiculed by the right-wing, might actually be working. While it\u0027s difficult to determine why crime rises and falls, to blame a policy when rates rise and ignore it when they drop doesn\u0027t make sense.CommentsLiftopiaWho you should be following on Instagram for breathtaking pictures from the slopes to the surf.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorOpponents who wanted to make the case that comprehensive reform of our current \"system\" would be a net cost just got some pretty bad news.Comments (140)Susan CamposBeautyundercover.comLast week, my ex-husband and his wife took residence in a shiny new split-level some 15 short steps from the Los Angeles home I share with my teen-aged son. When I informed my friends and family they thought we were crazy. But isn\u0027t it better to make an ex an ally rather than an enemy?CommentsHoward FinemanEditorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupIt\u0027s a crucial statistic, and it animates the ferocious debate about immigration now consuming Congress: Of the 12 million Hispanic Americans who voted in 2012, only some 4 million voted for the Republican presidential candidate.Comments (462)Rep. Steve IsraelCongressman from New York\u0027s 3rd Congressional DistrictI\u0027m proud to represent an area of Long Island that has been the location for many famous movies and TV shows. Shamefully, it\u0027s also now the location for a show whose characters are disgraceful, misleading, and fuel anti-Semitic stereotypes: Princesses: Long Island.Comments (25)Sharyn BiresPublisher, \u0027San Francisco Brides\u0027While you\u0027re saving yourself for your crush, he\u0027s out there living his life -- and you\u0027re wasting your time.Comments (162)Nell MinowCo-founder, GMI Ratings; Movie criticWhat\u0027s the very first thing you do when you wake up? If your answer is \"check my email,\" \"curse my alarm clock,\" or \"start making a to-do list,\" you are missing the chance to begin your day with the sense of peace and purpose that will give you focus.CommentsJoyce McFaddenPsychoanalyst, author of \u0027Your Daughter\u0027s Bedroom: Insights for Raising Confident Women\u0027As her father, you have the power to make certain she knows your love is steadfast, and that she won\u0027t have to choose between your love and her maturation.Comments (115)Chelsea ClintonBoard member, Clinton FoundationThe astounding number of disconnected youth also creates long-term risks for our country. To address the significant challenges posed by youth disconnection, we must develop and implement effective solutions targeting specific needs of specific populations.Comments (20)Mike HoganExecutive Arts and Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post Media GroupDon Draper doesn\u0027t kill people. He doesn\u0027t cook or deal drugs. He doesn\u0027t oversee an organized-crime syndicate. Hell, he doesn\u0027t even use the F-word. But there\u0027s no question he\u0027s a bastard. He lies. He cheats. He undermines his colleagues in ways both overt and underhanded. And yet, in spite of it all, there has always been something about Don that makes us love him anyway. We know what a scoundrel he is, but we just can\u0027t quit him.Comments (97)Julie JensenWife, mother, digital media veteran, stroke survivorI\u0027m sure I\u0027d still be searching for fulfillment if I didn\u0027t receive a wake-up call on September 30, 2004. I was 26 when I was wheeled into the ER and a nurse asked if I knew what was happening. \"I think I had a stroke,\" I muttered. \"Ma\u0027am, you are HAVING a stroke.\"Comments (50)William AstoreWriter, Professor, Retired Lt. Colonel, Air ForceHow about some truly fresh thinking on national security? Here are five ideas that are more visionary than anything our sclerotic and self-absorbed bureaucracy will ever produce.Comments (34)Bonnie FullerPresident \u0026 Editor-in-Chief, HollywoodLife.comMiley Cyrus, you may take heat for your adventurous new video that boldly celebrates the joys of being young, female and sexy. But ignore the dissers -- \"We Can\u0027t Stop\" is an anthem you deserve to be proud of!CommentsJanus AdamsEmmy Award-winning journalist, historian and producerThis Freedom Day reminds us that only by confronting what is wrong can we make things right. To see ourselves as part of the struggle is to empower ourselves as part of the solution.Comments (73)Elia SaikalyAdventure Filmmaker/Social entrepreneur, Founder of FindingLifeMy goal was to bring to life the majestic beauty of the Himalayas and draw attention away from the negativity that has surrounded Everest in the past years. I wanted to remind people of the infinite possibility that the tallest mountain on Earth symbolizes in each of us.CommentsTimothy Greenfield-SandersPhotographer and filmmakerIt was California Proposition 8 that pushed us to make -- perhaps angered us to make -- The Out List in the first place. It airs on HBO, June 27th, the 44th anniversary of the Stonewall riots.CommentsBarbara LeePresident, Barbara Lee Political Office and Barbara Lee Family FoundationAsking if men -- for whom societal structures have been working pretty favorably forever -- can \"have it all\" strikes a nerve with some women. Rightfully so. Perhaps it is because women are what\u0027s missing from this budding Daddy Wars conversation.CommentsMarcus ByrneU.S. Army officerI\u0027ve survived 30 months of deployment, jumping out of airplanes, field time in Germany in the winter. Anxiety is something that happens to other people, to weaker people, not me.Comments (14)Jordan SchultzThe Huffington Post\u0027s sports columnist, The Schultz ReportHeading into Game 7, we are faced with a litany of questions -- namely, why Popovich subbed out Duncan and Parker late in Game 6; how in the world the league\u0027s most consistent team and well-run organization choked away a surefire win; and whether either one of these teams has anything left in the tank. Maybe, though, the question we should be asking is what will Dwyane Wade provide for the Heat, because lightning won\u0027t strike the same place twice.CommentsDJ Louie XIVDJLike the majority of our generation, knowing that we feed into our own misery by engaging in the grown-up high school cafeteria known as Twitter and emptying our increasingly scant bank-accounts on a smorgasbord of Apple products, this man has an uncanny comfort with being a complete and total hypocrite, a quality that my mom, admirably if aberrantly, does not possess. So yes, Kanye West is perhaps morally reprehensible. But he is also the most perfectly polished mirror we have.Comments (23)Tira HarpazFounder and President, CollegeBound AdviceI\u0027ve lost 50 pounds in the past year, and it\u0027s just plain hard. I\u0027m not on any special diet, I don\u0027t have a personal trainer, and I\u0027m terrified every minute that I\u0027ll backslide like I have in the past.Comments (21)Jason Howe, 2013.19.06Murray Lipp, 2013.19.06Mandy Jackson-Beverly, 2013.19.06Arianna Huffington, 2013.19.06Sam Liccardo, 2013.19.06Oyster, 2013.19.06Eric Boehlert, 2013.19.06Charlene Obernauer, 2013.19.06Greg Archer, 2013.19.06Dave Helfert, 2013.19.06Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"\u0027SOPRANO\u0027 DEAD",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
