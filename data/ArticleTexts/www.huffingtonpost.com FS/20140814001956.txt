Well, HuffPost Live, which turns 2 years old today, has been defiantly independent since it launched. If you haven\u0027t made HuffPost Live a regular part of your HuffPost experience, don\u0027t wait any longer! Each weekday features a vibrant, ever-changing mix of smart, compelling conversations with newsmakers, politicians, celebrities and, just as important, members of the HuffPost community, sharing their personal experiences and discussing the issues that most impact their lives. Click here to watch some examples of why HuffPost Live was recently awarded the Webby for Best News and Information Channel for the second year in a row. Happy 2nd birthday, HuffPost Live!Here lies a racial disparity that\u0027s difficult for honest people to ignore. How can black people openly carry a real gun when we can\u0027t even pick up a BB gun in a store without arousing suspicion? The answer in America is that the Second Amendment doesn\u0027t really apply to black people.CNBC contributor, MSNBC commentator and former White House aideIt\u0027s said that the best defense is a good offense. This strategy probably lies behind Hillary Clinton\u0027s recent takedown of President Barack Obama\u0027s foreign policy. After all, Clinton was a lead architect of that policy as Secretary of State, and the policies that she espoused until recently now lie in shambles.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \"To Move the World: JFK\u0027s Quest for Peace\"The disturbing nature of the frequency of recent news reports in which unarmed Black men have been killed by law enforcement officers is only exceeded by this fact: the act itself is deeply embedded into the racial fabric of our nation.Author, \u0027FREESTYLE: Reflections on Faith, Family, Justice, and Pop Culture\u0027; Founding Pastor, Joy Tabernacle A.M.E. Church, Dallas, TexasWe should care a great deal about the Ebola outbreak, but not for the reasons propagated by cable news. We should care about Ebola for what it says about the current state of the health care system in resource-limited settings around the globe.Assistant Professor of Emergency Medicine, Brown Medical SchoolI served as a crew commander in the Israeli artillery corps at the beginning of the Second Intifada, and I feel compelled to counter this claim from Israel.Former Crew Commander, Israeli Artillery CorpsIf comic brilliance could be converted to nuclear energy, Robin Williams would have qualified as a one-man power plant. Lightning-quick, wildly unpredictable, and possessed by a endless cast of characters and voices -- on stage and off -- Robin couldn\u0027t help but be funny. That\u0027s what drew us to him, of course. He gave us joy.Award-winning actress, author and activistWhite Americans like me have to stop channel surfing all the outrageously bad news from around the world and focus on the death that is happening in our own cities to our fellow Americans.Executive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostNothing has as much impact as the moving image. It stirs our passions, our outrage. The written words or the talking heads that could perhaps explain the overall situation can\u0027t change the narrative... the most potent images will win the day.Academy Award-winning director, screenwriter and producerThe possibility of being imperfect -- of making mistakes -- without dire consequences is in some respects the very definition of privilege. For only some groups need to fear that they may trip the wire of state-sanctioned violence at any moment.Associate Professor of Law, University of Miami School of LawThe call for change was loud. But, it was lost on me because I had heard this all before. I had seen online and heard in conversations the focus shift away from Michael Brown to the ills of black St. Louis. I wanted to know about Michael Brown.Doctoral candidate in American studies, Saint Louis UniversitySince the dawn of the 20th century, Australia and the US have stood together with a shared vision for a free, peaceful and prosperous world. Today we reaffirm our confidence that the relationship will continue to be a force for good in the Asia-Pacific and Indian Ocean regions, and the world.U.S. Secretary of StateUnited States Secretary of DefenseEven though I didn\u0027t know Robin Williams, I\u0027m affected by his suicide. It feels like we all are. We all feel so goddamn sad. And so I say this: If in your life you feel down or lost or in pain... I beg you to call someone.ComedianIf Travyon Martin, Eric Garner and Michael Brown were white, Harvard research shows that they might have fared better without the \"fears of criminality\" and \"the criminal face\" associated with being black.Author and Journalist published in Salon.com, the Jerusalem Post, Chicago Tribune, The Hill\u0027s Congress Blog, and other publications. www.hagoodman.comAfter unexpectedly deciding to split the 9/11 case into two trials last month, a military commission judge reversed himself and decided on Wednesday to put the severed case back together again. At least for now.Senior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstU.S. women still wait -- we do not have equal rights in our Constitution. Oh sure, we have some statutes outlawing discrimination, but they\u0027ve already been weakened by the courts and can be overturned outright at any time by an increasingly hostile Congress.Money Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsJ Dilla was a musical genius. His contribution both as a producer and rapper pioneered the musical platform that so many current artists have built on.Emmy nominated Eco-beauty advocate. Supports sustainable lifestyles, culture and music.From here on in, you can assume that, in the Israeli media\u0027s view, violence against Israel is the result of American fumbling.\u0027Author; New Yorker contributorThe nutritional fable goes something like this: Rather than criticize industry for its questionable practices, health organizations should \"sit at the table\" with industry leaders and see what compromises can be reached. This all sounds wonderfully cooperative and democratic, but it also ignores some stark realities.Registered dietitian; Strategic Director of Dietitians For Professional IntegrityAdvocates of atheism continue to appear, each new wave of thinkers reshaping what has come before. What Philip Kitcher has to say is ultimately neither new nor convincing. He makes the same mistakes that most others make who argue the case for atheism or secular humanism.Lecturer, writer, and President Emeritus, Union for Reform JudaismThere still needs to be debate about depression as an illness, because there is still a lack of understanding that illness is exactly what it is.Author and former head of communications to Tony BlairCoffee of any variety is usually a welcome sign in the morning, but for some tea drinkers the classic beverage is a bit too overpowering. But it doesn\u0027t have to be the case!Founder and Host, Potluck VideoAfter thirteen years of war, after all the violence, all the theft, all the lies, are we so naïve and so closeted to be surprised at this death?Senior Fellow, Center for International Policy; Board of Directors, Council for a Livable World; MatthewHoh.comThe battle to establish the truth of what happened in Cairo on 14 August last year has only just begun. Although Sisi\u0027s road to perdition may be a long one, the HRW report will ensure that the Egyptian leader will be haunted by the ghosts of his victims at Rabaa. Editor, Middle East EyeHis blend of tactics has subjected him to withering criticism from Republicans in Congress, but his tactical caution, so far, has left the US hovering just out of range of a series of potentially dangerous confrontations.Author and Fellow at the Century FoundationHas America\u0027s moral arc bent toward justice over the last half century? By some measures, it appears not.Actor, \u0027M*A*S*H\u0027 and \u0027Providence\u0027Mr. Williams\u0027s electric presence, comic genius and comforting fallibility made him not only a great actor, but, perhaps, an emotional bridge from which the Millennials and their parents, the Boomers, could come together, better aware of their collective imperfections and differences.Senior/International Blog Editor, The Huffington PostThough this shortcut instantly satisfies our cravings, it wastes a fair amount of valuable fruit. With a practiced hand and a few more seconds, though, you can remove the green cap and the hard white flesh underneath, leaving an intact, beautiful berry.food52.comYou would think that having taught meditation for 13 years and worked with these people I would be a pro at this whole \"take care of yourself\" thing. I have never publicly admitted this, but given the stigma around mental health issues and suicide I feel that I need to now: two years ago I was suicidal.Author of \u0027The Buddha Walks into a Bar\u0027 and \u0027The Buddha Walks into the Office\u0027Botched executions are in danger of becoming the new normal in America. But unlike the other top execution nations, where people have no control over their government actions, the citizens of the United States have a choice. As soon as we say that it is not acceptable for our government to kill our fellow citizens in our name, then the death penalty will die.Executive Director, Death Penalty FocusThe negative perceptions of blacks, especially black males, by much of the public are not the only problem in effecting effective legal measures against police violence. There is no ironclad standard of what is or isn\u0027t an acceptable use of force in police misconduct cases.Author and political analystGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"WITNESS: COP SHOUTED \u0027SHOOT HIM\u0027",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
