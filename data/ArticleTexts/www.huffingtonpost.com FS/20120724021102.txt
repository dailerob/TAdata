{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027The real problem in our economy today is not a lack of productivity. The problem is that the gains from productivity growth have not been broadly shared. The wealthy have used their power to rig the deck so that most of the benefits of growth have gone those at the top. They have used their control of trade policy, the Federal Reserve Board, and more recently the Wall Street bailout, to ensure that those at the top have gained at the expense of everyone else. A higher minimum wage is an important step toward reversing this rigging. It should not be too much to expect that workers today should get at least as much as they did 45 years ago, and perhaps some dividend to allow them to share in the benefits of economic growth over this period. A minimum wage of $10 an hour would be a big step in the right direction.Read Post | Comments (183)Lisa Belkin, 07/23/12Senior columnist for life/work/family, The Huffington PostWhile there are (thank God) few parents who have watched their children branded as serial killers, there are (tragically) too many who can identify with another kind of parenting hell -- watching your child spiral toward insanity.Read Post | Comments (46)Elizabeth Warren, 07/23/12Democratic Candidate for U.S. Senate in MassachusettsA working market needs rules, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is starting to level the playing field.
