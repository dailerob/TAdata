{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Associate Dean, Harvard School of Public HealthIn a head-to-head race against time, the laborious pace at which public policy evolves is no match for the Usain Bolt-like speed of technological change: For example, would a ban on handheld devices be applicable to the new Apple Watch? To remain relevant, our public policies on distracted driving may need to sidestep the specific technologies and focus instead on such measures as eyes-on-the-road. Over time, new technology will solve the distracted driving problem that technology created. Eye-tracking devices mounted on the dash or rearview mirror will monitor the driver\u0027s mental state for signs of distraction, and will sound an alarm. Eventually -- 10 to 20 years from now -- self-driving cars will enable us to text to our heart\u0027s content. But, until technology provides the ultimate fix, the carnage on our roads will continue, and may even grow worse before it gets better. But it doesn\u0027t have to.It\u0027s been 31 days since the release of the White House Task Force on 21st Century Policing report, but the number of fatal police encounters is already over 100 and counting.

Today though, roughly nine months after last year\u0027s initial June 30 announcement, ISIS is claiming responsibility for attacks outside of its \"caliphate.\"Lawyer, Speaker, Best-Selling Author of \"EXTREMIST\"What I do doubt is that, with a few exceptions, women will beat men at their own game. They should be hell bent on changing the playground, not worried about competing on the same over trodden ground.Founder, Living in Digital TimesFor far-right activists and legislators concerned about marriage equality and other LGBT rights, Hobby Lobby provided the perfect opportunity: Pass state Religious Freedom Restoration Acts and effectively grant a religious-exemption claim from LGBT anti-discrimination laws, based on the Supreme Court\u0027s rewriting of the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993.Senior Fellow, People For the American Way and People For the American Way FoundationWhy isn\u0027t financial literacy education working?

The answer is, we shouldn\u0027t.President of The Black Institute \u0026 Former CEO of ACORNYep, the hawks\u0027 vision for Iran sure sounds ludicrous. But their vision of Americans being greeted as liberators by cheering Iraqis with sweets and flowers was equally ludicrous. A decade later we\u0027re still dealing with the tragic fall-out of chasing after that particular pipe-dream.Executive Director, Peace Action WestThe time has come for the international community to end torture as a cheap form of investigative tool by the authorities -- and it is possible. In the words of the historical Rabbi Hillel: \"If not now, when?\"Founder, International Bridges to JusticeI am a 27-year-old Jew living in Pakistan. It\u0027s a statement that has elicited shock, warnings, threats and intense curiosity ever since I moved from Morocco to Karachi, the country\u0027s largest city in the homeland of my parents.Humble yet loudmouth micro blogger who doesn\u0027t shy away to be politically incorrect.Interested in geopolitics,society \u0026 culture of PakistanBoth the Republicans and the Democrats began April by issuing major announcements about the structure of each party\u0027s upcoming debate calendar.

Mike Pence signing the pro-discrimination SB101 \"Religious Freedom Restoration Act\" into law last week, it\u0027s this: the bigots, homophobes and neo-segregationists have been coaxed out of the woodwork, exposing themselves for what they really believe.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027We knew the logic. What we didn\u0027t know was if people with no experience using computers -- and with mediocre, if any, high school qualifications -- could quickly learn to code. Sihle was our guinea pig.

I am not braver or more courageous than others who choose to keep their status a secret.Student, Harvard UniversityNanotechnology has the potential to revolutionize our world for the better in fields like energy, medicine and aerospace.
