{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Writer and FilmmakerOne of the most lauded speeches at the Democratic convention was given by Bill Clinton, and the bulk of it found the former president debunking the assertions made by Mitt Romney, Paul Ryan and others at the Republican convention. It\u0027s no wonder then that the undecided voters in key swing states who will determine the winner in November are not ready to trust Romney and Ryan enough to buy into a policy that doesn\u0027t help them initially, but only will based on the promises of those who would benefit immediately. They don\u0027t trust Romney and Ryan to deliver. Throw in the GOP\u0027s shift to the extreme right on social issues, which is scaring away some women voters, and the president\u0027s ability to hold a lead in the polls despite the economic conditions starts to make clear sense.Read Post | Comments (347)Dean Baker, 09/10/12Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027The Clinton-era policies sent the U.S. economy on a seriously wrong path. They created an absurd obsession with budget deficits, a pattern of bubble-driven growth, an incredibly bloated financial sector and an unsustainable trade deficit.Read Post | Comments (82)Christopher Conradi, 08.28.2012IT Specialist, Business AnalyticsWhy wait until something is broken to fix it?

We all know why: because the poor aren\u0027t \"likely voters\" and the poor aren\u0027t big campaign donors. It\u0027s really that simple. And that\u0027s sickening.Read Post | Comments (306)Steve Rosenbaum, 09/10/12CEO, Magnify.net; author, \u0027Curation Nation\u0027; NYC entrepreneur at largeThe National 9/11 Memorial Museum deserves to be back on track with a firm opening date. It\u0027s importance overshadows a petty political squabble, and standing in its way puts the Nation\u0027s needs behind political objectives.Read Post | Comments (14)Michelangelo Signorile, 09/10/12Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesI tried to find the homophobes in Charlotte. Really, I did. But such voices were missing or muted at the convention. The memo went out this year to fully include gays.Read Post | Comments (56)Rana Florida, 09/10/12CEO, The Creative Class GroupI\u0027ve talked with successful CEO\u0027s, authors, chefs, politicians, designers, artists, philanthropists, doctors and entrepreneurs, but I\u0027ve yet to interview a sports star for advice on business.

I haven\u0027t seen a razor in a few months, a barber in a year or a date in two. I am a football player by choice, but an offensive lineman by the grace of God.Read Post | CommentsPaul Douglas, 09/10/12Chief Meteorologist, \"WeatherNation TV\"; Star Tribune\u0027s \"On Weather with Paul Douglas\"Will the GOP rise to the occasion, or bet the farm on carbon, and ask our grandkids to deal with the mess? It\u0027s time for bold leadership. Climate change is a threat, but it is also an opportunity to transition to a cleaner, greener, more sustainable economy.Read Post | Comments (216)Jeremiah Goulka, 09/10/12WriterI used to be a serious Republican, moderate and business-oriented, who planned for a public-service career in Republican politics.

He\u0027s right. And the U.S. economy won\u0027t return to normal until that basic bargain is remade.Read Post | Comments (198)James Franco, 09/09/12Actor and authorIt\u0027s funny that Newsies was your favorite thing you\u0027ve seen on Broadway. Of all the things we\u0027ve seen. I admit it was entertaining, but also funny -- you kept wondering why I was laughing when all the cute little newsboys in their Depression-era outfits started doing cartwheels and back flips.Read Post | Comments (24)Michael Kaiser, 09/10/12President, John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing ArtsSome believe that donor fatigue is an inevitable consequence of long-term involvement with an arts organization, or other not-for-profit venture, and that these organizations must be prepared to replace their major donors regularly. I do not agree. I do not believe donor fatigue is inevitable.Read Post | CommentsLeo W. Gerard, 09/10/12International President, United SteelworkersFour years ago was September 2008. George W. Bush was president and Wall Street giant Lehman Brothers was collapsing. It was a time of fear. It was a time of panic about the future. Recalling that anxiety is unsettling. But it\u0027s important for comparison sake.Read Post | Comments (77)Maureen Ryan, 09/10/12TV critic, The Huffington Post\"Guys with Kids\" fails to find any of the humor in parenting, and rests most of its humor on a very tired and ill-conceived hook: Men taking care of small children is hilarious because it\u0027s so unexpected!Read Post | Comments (11)Jared Bernstein, 09/10/12Senior Fellow, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesReading Matt Bai\u0027s piece in the New York Times Magazine about the Ohio economy, and reflecting on many recent discussions and debates, I found myself pondering the question posed above.

Learsy, 09/10/12Author, \u0027Oil and Finance: The Epic Corruption Continues\u0027Is the Obama administration as pathetically submissive to OPEC and oil industry pressures as the Bush administration?

Morhaim, M.D. and Neill Franklin, 09/09/12Drug use will never be completely eradicated, but that doesn\u0027t mean we should throw up our hands and do nothing.
