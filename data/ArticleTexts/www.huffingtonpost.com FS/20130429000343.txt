{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonWith the question of how to respond to the Syrian government\u0027s use of chemical weapons looming over him, I wonder if President Obama, at the opening of the new Bush Library, stepped into its \"Decision Points Theater.\" The interactive exhibit allows viewers to be the decider-in-chief on a number of key situations from the Bush years, including the invasion of Iraq, after hearing advice from actors playing political and military leaders. Of course, to make Obama\u0027s experience mirror Bush\u0027s, he\u0027d be offered cherry-picked \"facts\" backing up a pre-determined decision. Knowing what to do about Syria would be a \"slam dunk.\" A more useful exhibit would be one explaining why so many from the Bush administration who got Iraq so wrong are still being listened to. The disastrous and tragic consequences of the terrible decision-making on Iraq are still very much with us (here is one powerful and moving example), and the unintended consequences of strengthening Iran will be with us for a very long time.Comments (99)Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOExpect next week\u0027s policy meetings to signal that central bank stand ready to step in, once again, to maintain the disconnect between buoyant equity markets and sluggish economic conditions -- not as an end in itself but, given Congressional dysfunction, as virtually the only way today to support economic activity.Comments (123)Menachem RosensaftProfessor of law and son of Holocaust survivorsSixty-eight years after the liberation of Bergen-Belsen, 68 years after the end of the Holocaust, we may not ignore a disturbing resurgence of racist and neo-fascist political groups in at least three countries that belong to both the European Union and NATO.Comments (228)Arianna HuffingtonA lot of the who, what, where, and how of the Boston bombing and what led up to it have already been answered and, no doubt, more details will eventually be filled in. The why, however, is the more elusive question. But it\u0027s also a crucial one.Comments (881)Mick EbelingFounder, Not Impossible FoundationThe EyeWriter has been a journey, and due to the nature of ALS it\u0027s a never-ending one. It started in 2008, and it continues on today. I am often asked, \"Why did you do it?\"Comments (140)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundHow many millions of children who were hurt or neglected themselves grow up hopeless, hate-filled, and continue the cycle of hurting others? All children deserve to be allowed and encouraged to dream by the adults around them in their homes, schools, and communities.Comments (49)Adrian GrenierActorI can\u0027t entirely escape stress. No one can. Our collective experience requires that we endure at least a certain amount of anxiety, especially when we strive for bigger goals that take us outside our comfort zone.Comments (55)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistWhen it comes to physical fitness, I\u0027ve always opted for the tried, true and traditional. I\u0027m perfectly happy with my light weight-training and a good jog in the park. But apparently I\u0027ve been missing out on a whole new wave of inventive, fun and sometimes hilarious workout routines -- from \"aerial yoga\" to \"booty ballet!\"Comments (115)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorIs this bipartisan support to mitigate one of the noxious effects of sequestration? Or is it papering over the high-visibility stuff that affects the affluent while lots of other budget bleeding goes on beneath the radar?Comments (389)Yoko OnoArtistFor me, it started when gas companies visited my town in upstate New York to pitch a natural gas pipeline that would provide infrastructure for future fracking. I did not want to see my land destroyed.Comments (36)Brian StelterMedia reporter, The New York Times; Author, \u0027Top of the Morning\u0027The Today show\u0027s biggest problem could have simply been that Good Morning America (GMA) lusted more fiercely after victory. That GMA was hungrier.Comments (42)Clemantine WamariyaWriter, AdvocateLike many American millennials, an 8th grade field trip first brought me into contact with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Unlike most of my peers, however -- then and now -- visiting the Museum was not my first up-close and personal encounter with genocide.Comments (66)Marcus SamuelssonAward-Winning Chef, Restaurateur \u0026 AuthorHow do I combat getting my weight out of control? By thinking about balance throughout the day.Comments (12)Alicia KeysSinger, songwriter, AIDS activist, philanthropistWe know that HIV is both preventable and treatable, yet because of stigma women don\u0027t talk about it openly, we don\u0027t use protection, we don\u0027t get tested, and we don\u0027t stay on treatment. In addition to stigma, there are still far too many misconceptions when we think and talk about HIV.Comments (31)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027What is Washington doing? Worse than nothing. It has now adopted the same kind of austerity economics that\u0027s doomed Europe -- cutting federal spending and reducing total demand.Comments (748)Kareem Abdul-JabbarNBA Legend, Pop Culture columnistThe focus on wealth makes the show play out like a classic Shakespearean tragedy. The fabulous homes, clothes, and opulent parties at first make the viewers admire the housewife and wish to be like her. But soon we see the \"real\" person, whose hubris reveals a deep unhappiness that they, being unreliable narrators, deny.Comments (192)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarWhile discipline is crucial during all stages of raising a child, discipline is not about getting even, inducing guilt, or even punishing -- all of which are forms of shaming a child. Instead, disciplining, at any age, is about correcting and guiding him toward more appropriate behavior.Comments (281)Lori FradkinSenior Lifestyle EditorThroughout my 20s, I bounced back and forth between feeling like Mommy and Daddy\u0027s Not-So-Little Girl and an adult who was out there in the world on her own. I wondered if that in-between feeling would ever go away. It did.Comments (67)Bob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowIt\u0027s all yet another case study in how the Republicans too often comport themselves in the wake of a disaster -- these self-proclaimed \"patriots\" are merely selective, fair-weather patriots, only willing to lend their unified support when the president is from their own party.Comments (1,879)George TakeiSocial media starI was just five years old, and would spend much of my childhood behind barbed wire in that camp and, later, another in California called Tule Lake. One hundred twenty thousand other Japanese Americans from the West Coast suffered a similar fate.Comments (394)Seth ShostakSenior Astronomer, SETI InstituteIt seems that the frequency of planets able to support life is roughly one percent. In other words, a billion or more such worlds exist in our galaxy alone. That\u0027s a lot of acreage, and it takes industrial-strength credulity to believe it\u0027s all bleakly barren.Comments (117)Randi ZuckerbergFounder and CEO, Zuckerberg Media; Editor-In-Chief, Dot ComplicatedToday, I wanted to highlight seven women whom I admire for reaching towards their career dreams, supporting worthwhile causes and raising beautiful families.CommentsChez PazienzaCo-host, \u0027The Bubble Genius Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027; writer, Deus Ex MalcontentBy now there\u0027s a pretty good chance you know A.J. so well that it feels like he\u0027d get an invitation to your next family reunion -- all because he did something stupid in front of a camera and consequently became our country\u0027s latest instant pop culture fascination.Comments (110)Shaquille O\u0027Neal and Ray ChambersMalaria is a disease that is not on the top of mind of the general public, and it\u0027s important that we change this, the more people know about it, the better chance we have to make it a disease of the past. We can\u0027t let a mosquito win.Comments (39)Cherie BlairFounder, Cherie Blair Foundation for WomenFinancial independence brings real autonomy, and the power to say no. That\u0027s the great prize for women. The benefit doesn\u0027t end there -- supporting women entrepreneurs has a great knock-on effect.Comments (14)Hunter BidenChairman of the Board, World Food Program USALive Below the Line is a national campaign to help alleviate extreme poverty by challenging Americans to eat and drink for less than the global poverty line -- $1.50 a day -- as 1.4 billion people on our planet must do every day.Comments (50)Ronnie WoodMember of iconic rock band, the Rolling Stones; guitarist, artist, writerI think people are \u0027just creative\u0027 and this can be expressed in a number of ways. Bob Dylan and David Bowie create both music and art. Michelangelo could paint and sculpt. For me, it\u0027s just another way of expressing myself.Comments (22)Christy Turlington BurnsFounder, Every Mother Counts, Director/Producer, NO WOMAN, NO CRY, global maternal health advocate, mom, modelOn this visit to Haiti, I feel optimistic about the future Haitians can achieve, and proud of the work being done to create that future.Comments (30)Duane \u0027Dog\u0027 ChapmanStar, \u0027Dog and Beth: On the Hunt\u0027Today we have developed automatic and all kinds of crazy guns that our forefathers, if they were still alive, would not be okay with. Personally, I prefer to use non-lethal weapons. A gun is fine, but let\u0027s talk about the bullet.Comments (913)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorThe Boston Marathon bombings killed three and injured more than 180. The West, Texas industrial explosion killed at least 14 and injured more than 180. Guess which one drew the greater media and law enforcement response?Comments (266)Eric E. Schmidt and Jared CohenIn the coming decades, five billion people -- the majority of humanity -- will come online for the first time, mostly in parts of the world ridden with conflict, instability and repression. We\u0027ve spent much of the last year traveling to those parts of the world to witness the new digital age firsthand.Comments (45)Alicia Jessop, 2013.28.04Jason Silverstein, 2013.28.04Ruth Neubauer, 2013.28.04Honey Seltzer, 2013.28.04Rev.
