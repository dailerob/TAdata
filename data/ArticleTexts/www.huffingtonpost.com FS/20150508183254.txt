{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"It\u0027s been 10 years since The Huffington Post was born, on May 9, 2005. We\u0027ve done a lot of reminiscing during our anniversary week, but our real focus is on looking ahead. That\u0027s why the theme for our 10-year anniversary is \"The Next 10.\" To celebrate this milestone, we\u0027re rolling out a range of special projects, launches and events -- the high and the low, the serious and the playful -- and all of them have something to say about where we\u0027re coming from and especially where we\u0027re going. I\u0027m grateful to everyone who has been a part of HuffPost from Day 1. And I\u0027m especially grateful to everyone who has read, viewed and shared what we\u0027re doing on HuffPost. We are here because of you.In this era of truce, the US and Iran can dialogue about regional problems rather than seeing the absence of diplomacy exacerbate existing conflicts. Yet, in spite of this pending historic achievement, dark years await the Middle East.President, National Iranian American CouncilIf prevention were a national priority, how would our lives change? That question is followed by another one, which is: What will happen 10 years from now in terms of the health of Americans? Will the year 2025 find Americans stronger, healthier and living longer?Board-certified radiologist; Board member, Lesscancer; Author, \u0027A World Without Cancer\u0027No one should have to choose between providing for your family and being a good parent. Yet \"family-friendly\" work is still a pipe dream.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027This dark vision for the future will be our own fault if we allow the attack on journalism around the world to go unchecked for another decade, if we continue to look the other way and ignore how killing the messenger erodes democracy and threatens a free, open society.Founder and Executive Director of The GroundTruth Project, Co-founder of GlobalPostOf the many things that have touched me about the response to my memoir Wild, the fact that so many people who\u0027ve had and survived lung cancer or loved someone who died of the disease see themselves in my story is among the most meaningful.Author, \"Wild\"\"As the oldest in my family, I had the privilege of watching my mom raise my four brothers and sisters, work full-time as a teacher,and earn a graduate degree. Her tireless example taught me the value of hard work.\"CoFounder and President of PowerToFly.comBOGOTÁ -- Our human habitat today is not just a little bit wrong. It is very wrong. Hopefully, future cities will be more effective in making all citizens feel equal and included.Former mayor, BogotáWe need to move beyond the \"flags and footprints\" missions and travel to space with the intent to stay, and Mars is our best bet. The good news is that the majority of the obstacles are economic, rather than engineering. The bad news is that it\u0027s a tough business case to close.Business Development Specialist for Masten Space Systems, Media Specialist for the Commercial Spaceflight FederationThe future of Islam depends on Muslims deciding whether we will be fueled by examples of hope or examples of hatred.Executive Director and Chaplain, Islamic Center at New York UniversityTen years from now, the world will be smack in the middle of a historic transition in the relationship between car and driver, as robotic operating systems increasingly take charge of monitoring the roadway, executing lane changes, controlling steering and braking, sharing data with nearby vehicles and surrounding infrastructure, and -- above all -- avoiding crashes.Associate Dean, Harvard School of Public HealthIf all goes as planned, sometime today the World Health Organization will officially declare Liberia to be free at last of the deadly Ebola virus, having passed through the requisite 42-day window without a single new case of the disease.Assistant Professor of Emergency Medicine, Brown Medical SchoolFor all of us over here in Europe, this seems like our weakest, loneliest moment. But it is high time for Europe to grow up, and as everybody knows, there\u0027s no better way to force someone to grow than to inflict a little suffering on them.L\u0027Huffington Post Editorial DirectorWe\u0027re too focused on questions at the margins -- death versus abortion, rape, and incest or abortion under all circumstances or no circumstances. These questions do little to illuminate the reality of most women\u0027s lives and the range of feelings people have about abortions that happen in the real world.Director of the ACLU’s Reproductive Freedom Project.Wall Street cannot be an island onto itself and we need to break up those largest banks to put the focus back on working class Americans.Independent U.S. Senator from VermontSome 12.2 million people, more than half of the population, are estimated to need humanitarian assistance. A similar number have been displaced -- between 6.5 million and 7.8 million -- within Syria, and three to four million have been displaced on to neighboring states.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteNEW YORK -- A decade from now, the hearts of some of our largest cities will no longer be defined by gleaming skyscrapers surrounded by well-manicured corporate plazas. The city will regain its human scale and emerge once again as a series of communities -- completing a fascinating journey back to the future.Milstein Professor of Urban Development, Columbia UniversityThe next decade is decisive because trajectory counts for so much; if we bend it now, we may slide the car to a halt with just the front tires hanging off the cliff. But if we sail on for a few more years, it\u0027s pretty clear we\u0027re fast and furiously going airborne -- that\u0027s what happens when, say, Arctic permafrost starts to melt in earnest, releasing clouds of methane.Author of a dozen books, including \u0027The End of Nature\u0027 and \u0027Deep Economy\u0027I want my children, Max and Summer, to always appreciate what they have, but also to understand they have a role in helping our fellow citizens around the world to the basic need of food. I\u0027d love for them to stumble upon this article and other hunger relief stories a decade from now and see that there is an end to world hunger.Performer, mom and global hunger relief advocateHow about we pause, put down our devices, look up and listen to our hearts and our consciences? Not so much \u0027connectivity\u0027 as just connecting with each other. And if that moral progress could keep pace with technological progress then that would be, well, real progress.Hashemite Kingdom of JordanThe state of race, culture and religion in America is a key metric for how we are evolving as a society. The question for the church in 2025 is do we have enough elasticity and self-awareness to accommodate other customs, and views different from our own?Senior Pastor, Potter\u0027s House, TexasToday, following decades of environmental action, I\u0027m proud to advocate for federal climate legislation and support President Obama\u0027s efforts to act on climate knowing that the evidence is in: Smart environmental standards boost innovation and strengthen our economy.Dean of the US House of Representatives | Ranking Member, House Judiciary CommitteeThis new movement for free higher education is therefore a very welcome, and very American, development. But it raises an uncomfortable question: What do we do about the 41 million Americans who are burdened with student debt today?Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourSenior Fellow, Advanced Leadership Initiative, Harvard University. Co-founder, National Student Debt Jubilee ProjectSenior Fellow, Advanced Leadership Initiative, Harvard University. Co-Founder and President Emeritus, Presidio Graduate SchoolWith a music career spanning five decades, Boz Scaggs has produced a rich catalog of songs that stretches across multiple genres. His 1976 breakthrough album, Silk Degrees, went multi-platinum and spawned a number of hits, including \"Lido Shuffle\" and the GRAMMY-winning \"Lowdown.\"PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorIt\u0027s unnerving how teams can make business and sport decisions on your body while you\u0027re not given the same grace to make the best choices for your own career. Maybe in 10 years the business of football will be equally regarded on all sides.6-year NFL veteran, screenwriter, creatorOn Monday night we celebrated HuffPost\u0027s 10-year anniversary with a party at the Gramercy Park Hotel in New York City. And since HuffPost and Goldman Sachs have partnered for nearly three years to spotlight solutions around the world, we had a conversation about what we\u0027ve learned and what\u0027s in store for the next 10 years. Here is a lightly edited transcription of our conversation.Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.We have a saying at Save the Children: \"All kids are born ready to learn, but not all are given the same opportunities to learn.\" The same goes for moms. It\u0027s up to all of us to break this cycle and help create brighter, bolder futures for families.Actress; Save the Children Artist AmbassadorCEOs and other business leaders have to stand up for all of their stakeholders -- employees, customers, partners, shareholders and local communities -- and recognize that they are part of a larger ecosystem. Issues ranging from climate change and global health to food production and education impact every business.Chairman and CEO of SalesforceIf there is a silver lining to be found in the devastating California drought, it\u0027s that many more Americans are finally thinking about where and how their food is grown.Food Program Director, GRACE Communications FoundationDirector, Water and Energy Programs, GRACE Communications FoundationIn the next 10 years, we believe that computers will move beyond their current role as our assistants, and become our advisors. With their help, we\u0027ll grapple with and solve some of the toughest issues facing the world today.Executive chairman of GoogleDirector of Google Ideas \u0026 Advisor to the Executive Chairman of GoogleYes, Nike, a company that grew to be worth billions by outsourcing jobs to overseas sweatshops, a company that sets up P.O.-box subsidiaries in tax havens to avoid paying U.S. taxes, a company that uses threats to extort tax breaks from its \"home\" state. Is this really the sort of company Obama wants to use as the face of what the TPP will bring?Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"LEFT BEHIND",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
