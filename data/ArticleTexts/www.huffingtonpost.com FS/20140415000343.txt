{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"David CoatesWorrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsThe greatest danger currently facing all of us in America, and particularly progressives, is one of drift. As an economy, the United States is drifting along a low-growth path that is acclimatizing all of us to levels of unemployment which only a decade ago would have been treated as an outrage. As a society, the United States is drifting towards levels of income and wealth inequality so large that, if left unchallenged, will soon become irreversible. And as a political system, the United States is drifting towards a Republican sweep of both the House and the Senate in November unless the democratic left acts now to reverse what is in truth a carefully orchestrated and heavily funded great moving right show. Those of us of a progressive predisposition are drifting towards a political defeat of historic proportions -- one underpinned by an economic and social settlement of a highly conservative kind -- and we are doing so with what would appear to be only the slightest sense of alarm.Frazier Glenn Cross, 73, the alleged triple murderer who defiantly yelled \"Heil Hitler\" from the back of a rain spattered patrol car in Overland Park, KS on Sunday afternoon is a notorious, though exiled, hate group leader with a criminal record that dates back decades.Brian Levin, J.D.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityThe single most important step the US government can take to reverse discouraging economic trends is to mount a concerted, large-scale program directed at renewing our national infrastructure.Lawrence H.

I couldn\u0027t believe what was happening. It all felt like a nightmare, but one that I could never wake up from.Jonathan FlemingWrongfully convictedThe hedge fund managers\u0027 tax break is different from other tax breaks in that it has no economic rationale. With most other tax breaks, there\u0027s at least an argument as to how it serves some socially useful purpose. This is simply a case where the rich don\u0027t feel like paying taxes and are saying to the rest of us, \"what are you going to do about it?\"Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027We assign a cultural significance to sex; it is for procreation and the preservation of the family unit. We are told it is to be cherished and not commodified, but meanwhile sex screams at us from every billboard and TV channel. It seems sex can be used to sell everything except for sex itself.Belle KnoxDuke porn star; sex-positive feminist; activist for sex-worker rightsYour college choice isn\u0027t just about \"fit\" and \"comfort\"; it isn\u0027t just about the prestige of the school or the amenities it offers. Your college choice should reflect your aspirations, where you can imagine yourself discovering more about the world and your capacities to interact with it.Michael RothPresident, Wesleyan UniversityEgged on by well meaning (and not so well meaning) experts and by greedy drug companies, we are fast approaching this dystopic wonderland of universal childhood mental illness.Allen FrancesProfessor Emeritus, Duke UniversityThe commons is not just an Internet phenomenon or a matter of economics. The commons lies at the heart of a major cultural and social shift now underway.David BollierAuthor, \u0027Think Like a Commoner: A Short Introduction to the Life of the Commons\u0027Republicans want to make it harder to vote, Democrats want to make it easier. It\u0027s a simple concept, and it\u0027s one that strikes at a foundational belief most Americans share: Things always get better throughout American history, never worse.Chris WeigantPolitical writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comHe confesses that he suffers from a \"mild arachnophobia\" -- so much so that he was unable to cope with and preserve a large and colorful orb spider that he had acquired with some difficulty, and instead simply opened the plastic bag and released it back into the wild.David Edmund MoodyAuthor, \u0027The Unconditioned Mind: J. Krishnamurti and the Oak Grove School\u0027; science and math teacher, Laurel Springs SchoolAs so much of the current gun debate is generated by fear -- fear of crime, fear of violence, fear of government -- physicians should bring their clinical experiences in managing fear to this debate and thus provide patients with sound and effective alternatives to picking up a gun.Mike WeisserMike the Gun GuyWhile most students assigned to parent chaperones happily go along with the field trip flow, the following list of archetypical personalities keep chaperones on their toes.Claire WapoleWith the passage of the Affordable Care Act, Congress has provided us with a historic opportunity to reduce the demand for illegal drugs. The law requires health insurance companies, Medicaid and Medicare, to cover treatment for substance abuse disorders.Howard JosepherDrama and noise are a good thing and I do not mind being called a road bump especially if we can stop destructive educational policies that enrich publishers while masquerading as reform.Alan SingerSocial studies educator, Hofstra UniversityYour body is in a constant state of transformation and regeneration, and your experiences, no matter how seemingly inconsequential, from bullies to crushes to sloppy joes, have all left an indelible mark within you -- and more importantly, within your genome.Sharon MoalemAuthor, \u0027Inheritance: How Our Genes Change Our Lives -- and Our Lives Change Our Genes\u0027The thing is, these aren\u0027t accidental flaws in Facebook.

Steven HorsfordThe 300-acre landslide in Oso, Washington, which killed at least 30 people and destroyed the local community on March 22, 2014, reveals a consequence of a relatively unregulated and unseen industry: logging.Ellen Moyer, Ph.D.Independent environmental consultantAs I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve already read, Facebook recently acquired Oculus Virtual Reality for $2 billion. This is a huge deal... and here\u0027s why.Peter DiamandisChairman/CEO, XPRIZEEven years later, a woman\u0027s risk of hypertension, depression, obesity, migraines, heart disease, chronic pelvic pain, gastrointestinal disorders, substance abuse and many other chronic health problems are increased.Nancy C. LeeDeputy Assistant Secretary for Health-Women\u0027s Health, Director of the Office on Women\u0027s Health; Office of the Secretary, Department of Health and Human ServicesThe confusion of motion with action directed at a concrete policy objective is best exemplified by John Kerry.
