{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Peter SchuckLaw Professor, Yale; Author, \u0027Why Government Fails So Often, and How It Can Do Better\u0027The White House\u0027s decision to suspend enforcement of Obamacare\u0027s health insurance standards because of the website debacle was politically wise. But the main lesson we should draw from this incident is not that government can quickly change course in the face of failure. Rather, it teaches just the opposite: once Washington commits to a policy, it reverses direction only when waves of opposition engulf it. President Obama\u0027s sudden about-face is most unusual. The closest analogy is George H.W. Bush\u0027s abandonment of his dramatic \"no new taxes\" pledge. When Bill Clinton, now more popular than ever, urged him to honor his unequivocal proclamations that we could keep our insurance policies and doctors if we liked, many congressional Democrats immediately jumped ship. But in the vast majority of cases, failed policies endure.Comments (84)Grant Freeland and Deborah LovichIt wasn\u0027t until Harvard Business School professor Leslie Perlow approached us with an interesting proposal eight years ago that we really grasped what was driving top talent away -- and began a radical experiment to improve our work-life balance.CommentsDave EvansChief Futurist, CiscoWhat will the future be like? As depicted in today\u0027s popular movies and books, the future is either one of bright promise or it\u0027s a dystopian world where today\u0027s problems have only gotten worse. It\u0027s my job to think about what the world will look like in a few years, and how our actions today will impact that future.Comments (2)Ashley HesseltineWriter, media personality, occasional standup comedian, and founder/editor of Witty + PrettyI imagine it\u0027s a pretty great feeling when someone you want to marry actually asks you to marry him. And I\u0027m truly happy for my friends who are entering into a lifetime of monogamy with the ones they love. But some of these statuses have to be addressed.Comments (359)Bob CescaManaging Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowI\u0027m not talking about the myths and propaganda -- the \"death panel\" nonsense and the like. This is serious business: the well-financed, broadly implemented sabotage campaign designed to rig the law for failure, while also making it more difficult for Americans to receive insurance.Comments (150)Bernice A. KingChief Executive Officer, The King CenterWe mark the 50th anniversary of the assassination of JFK with sadness and wonder at what might have been if this extraordinarily charming and visionary president had lived to complete two terms. Yet we know that his luminous example of hope and courage continues to set the standard.CommentsEugenia ChandrisVice President, Chandris HotelsMacbeth murdered it with dire consequences; most people are deprived of it and while animals summon it with ease; it can be so evasive as to drive many to sickness and despair. Sleep has become more precious than any financial parameter, surpassing the intrinsic value of time itself... considered the ultimate equation with money.CommentsBelle Beth CooperContent crafter, BufferOne of the things that surprises me time and time again is how we think our brains work and how they actually work. For example, I always found it understandable that we can multitask, but according to the research, it\u0027s impossible for our brains to handle two tasks at the same time.Comments (12)Adam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; co-founder of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911It is virtually impossible to see the devastation after Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines or last weekend\u0027s tornadoes in the Midwest and not feel a tug on your heartstrings. But charity scam artists use that near-universal empathy to steal from survivors of these terrible events the help that they need.CommentsAnn VoskampNYTimes Bestselling Author, \u0027One Thousand Gifts: A Dare to Live Fully Right Where You Are\u0027Because get this, kids -- how a man proposes isn\u0027t what makes him romantic. It\u0027s how a man purposes to lay down his life that makes him romantic.Comments (106)Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOThe minutes suggest that this is a Fed that is contemplating not only what could go right if it continues on the current policy path but also what could go badly wrong.CommentsGeorge Stevens, Jr.Award-winning writer, director, producer and founder of the American Film InstituteWe made Years of Lightning, Day of Drums so the world might see and remember what we knew in those days. And now the larger reward is that the film survives so this and future generations may hear the soaring voice and view the vibrant likeness of the man who offered such singular inspiration half a century ago.Comments (25)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027We\u0027ve been left with a law that leaves us far short of universal coverage and requires people to get private insurance or pay a fine. That\u0027s not a pretty sight, but we shouldn\u0027t let this prevent us from recognizing the extent to which the ACA still presents an enormous step forward.Comments (841)Paul SchradeFriend to Robert F. KennedyRobert Kennedy shook hands with busboy Juan Romero in the hotel\u0027s pantry and then we walked directly into gunfire. He knew I was hit first because he asked \"Is everybody OK? Is Paul all right?\" as he lay fatally wounded -- always more concerned about others than himself.Comments (38)Nathan J. WinogradDirector, No Kill Advocacy CenterEnding the routine and casual killing of animals will not only save the lives of four million animals every year, but it will bring decency and compassion to our nation\u0027s shelters where these virtues are in tragically short supply.CommentsMicah J. MurrayBlogger at RedemptionPictures.comI was the least likely person to ever become a feminist. The world I grew up in was pure, concentrated patriarchy. Though I would have resented the suggestion, I was simply narrow-minded -- convinced that what I was believed was right though I had never honestly examined it.CommentsKaryn ThurstonFull-time mama and writer, www.girlofcardigan.comThese are the words I wish I\u0027d read before jumping headlong into the mommyhood with my books and my charts and my ideals and my high horses. They\u0027re flawed, and they aren\u0027t all pretty, but they\u0027re hard-won and honest and as true as I can get \u0027em.Comments (55)Peter GreenbergTravel Editor for CBS NewsIf you want a real deal on Black Friday, stay away from the mall. Black Friday and Cyber Monday are all part of Cyber Week, the one time of year, where you\u0027re guaranteed to find hotel deals all across the travel industry.CommentsCecile RichardsPresident of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, \u0026 Planned Parenthood VotesAccess to reproductive health care should never depend on your zip code -- and from statehouses to courthouses to the ballot box, we are going to continue the fight to make sure it doesn\u0027t.Comments (15)Matt WalshBlogger, talk radio host, father of twinsThat\u0027s our entire economic system: buy things. Everybody buy. It doesn\u0027t matter what you buy. Just buy. How appropriate, then, that a holiday created by our ancestors as an occasion to give thanks for what they had, now morphs into a frenzied consumerist ritual where we descend upon shopping malls to accumulate more things we don\u0027t need.Comments (80)Bernard-Henri LévyFrench philosopher and writerLet\u0027s pray for taxation. Without it we would have no way to protect the most vulnerable among us, to assist the most needy, and, most important of all, to enshrine in law the principle of responsibility for others.Comments (40)Adam GrantWharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027Bad people are more likely to opt into bad situations. When they band together, all too often, evil is the result.Comments (24)David J. EicherEditor-in-Chief, Astronomy magazineIn late November, Comet ISON moves its fastest as it flies from Virgo, through Libra and Scorpius, and then heads north into Ophiuchus.CommentsMike LuxCo-Founder, Democracy PartnersFor those of us who come out of the ranks of middle class or poor, and whose families and friends still live there, Social Security is a life or death issue. Every dollar matters to them.Comments (19)Josh SugarmannExecutive director, Violence Policy CenterLee Harvey Oswald buys his rifle through the NRA\u0027s American Rifleman magazine. Fifty years later, the magazine marks the anniversary by offering a \"Historic NRA Exclusive Offer\" hawking silver JFK half dollars issued after his assassination.Comments (20)Elise FrameStudent, blogger, and cancer survivorOne of my favorite movies is (500) Days of Summer. As I\u0027ve been reflecting on my own past 500 days, it\u0027s amazing to think of all that has transpired since Day One. November 24th will be Day 500 in my own ongoing relationship... with cancer.CommentsPeter H. GleickPresident, Pacific InstituteCalifornia precipitation has, on average, been declining, from an average of around 23 inches per year to around 21 inches per year -- a nearly 10 percent decline in the past 117 years.CommentsJohn FullertonFounder and President, Capital InstituteAt a time when institutions of business and government continue to fail society, two of our leading academic institutions missed the opportunity to provide essential moral leadership on the most pressing challenge ever faced in the history of human civilization.Comments (17)Bethany ThiesThat lady with the screaming kids is me. Nice to meet you.Everything is broken. My favorite plate, my favorite pair of heels, my favorite suede boots, my favorite holiday.CommentsBuilding MarketsAll around the developing world, every single day, entrepreneurs do business against all odds.CommentsOlivia ColePoet, author, and activistEvery day we are bombarded with movies and television shows in which white families are plugged as the \"default\" experience... and no one would say that these films are about race. What USAToday\u0027s tweet reveals is that white audiences are unable to see black people as beings separate from their blackness.Comments (363)David TrumbleAward-winning artist, cartoonist and illustratorComments (128)GAYOT.com, 2013.20.11Jerry Kremer, 2013.20.11Richard (RJ) Eskow, 2013.20.11Maggie Quale, 2013.20.11Marten Weber, 2013.20.11Keith Gaby, 2013.20.11Justin Marceau, 2013.20.11Jeff Rose, 2013.20.11Ryan Scott, 2013.20.11Steve Siebold, 2013.20.11Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"ALL FRACKED UP",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BizYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
