{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Children\u0027s Defense FundEach year at Halloween, our neighborhoods are bustling as children go door to door dressed as zombies, vampires, skeletons or something else fantastic and scary. For many children Halloween is the rare occasion to indulge in a fun time of ghost stories and goblins and trick or treats. But at the end of the night they put away their costumes and make-believe in their closets and return to their normal lives. Sadly, too many children do not have normal or safe or protected lives and their monsters are real. They do not have closets in many homeless shelters or on the streets or church steps where they sometimes live with homeless parents. They are not safe in drug- and violence-infested neighborhoods and suffer chronic hunger, especially on weekends and during long summer months when school is out.This is a crisis that is so vast, with needs so great, with potential consequences so dire, that no country can afford to stand on the sidelines. A few are doing a lot. But a lot are doing very little, or nothing at all. It is well past time to join what is a historic, groundbreaking, lifesaving mission -- a noble mission.U.S. Ambassador to the United NationsThe \"conventional wisdom\", as projected by some former U.S. officials and pro-Israel groups, is that Israelis will only make peace when they are given everything they want and feel secure. In fact, the opposite is true. It is only external pressure -- especially from the U.S. -- that historically has forced Israelis to make the right choice.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027We need to make teachers feel respected and trusted. Articles like the recent Time Magazine cover story do just the opposite. It is an attack on the profession as a whole and thus makes all teachers defensive, which does not lead to the kind of education we want in our schools.Journalism/English teacherEven if you believe that your single vote does not matter, and this happens for various reasons, you still are obliged to cast a vote on very important grounds.Host and Producer of Between the Lines with Barry Kibrick seen on PBS.Empire builders appear to be back in style. They are with us today both in reality and in fantasy. They present the world with the same dilemma that has troubled victims in the past -- how does the rest of the planet deal with them.Author and Fellow at the Century FoundationWe overwhelmingly believe these things -- from our CEOs to our local leaders to our elected representatives. And yet, the actual policies on our books as a nation don\u0027t reflect those values.Member of President Obama\u0027s Council of Economic AdvisersWelcome to our annual frightfest! Every year, we provide two tales of shrieking horror -- one for Democrats and one for Republicans -- so sit back and prepare to be terrified right out of your cheap cardboard costume.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comThe President is not running. The Vice President is not running. But the third and fourth most important positions in America are up for grabs on November 4 ... and these two leaders, and their own philosophies and policies will control Congress, Washington, DC and The United States for the next two years!Communication Strategist, Author of \"Words That Shook The World\"The part of Cook\u0027s essay that actually had me tearing up as I walked to work this morning was this string of 12 simple words: \"I consider being gay among the greatest gifts God has given me.\"Executive Editor, HuffPost Gay VoicesUnfortunately, many voters will head to the polls on November 4th and simply vote down the party line. Far too many won\u0027t spend a little time to research the various candidates\u0027 actual records beyond their party affiliation.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorI have to live, my babies need me, my husband needs me. I am fighting this disease with everything I can.Mother, Wife, Stage IV SurvivingFar too many of us spend our time paddling around in the shallow things of life instead of heading straight for the deeps. We get tangled up on the sandbars of the shallow waters of life, dissipating our energies on the trivial. This is especially relevant now as people prepare to vote in the election of this coming Tuesday, November 4.AuthorBecause of their lesser interest in foreign policy, the American people are not isolationists. They are simply open-minded, subject to persuasion by their political leaders.Associate Professor of Law at George Washington University School of Law in Washington, D.C.This is a good week to unpack Mandela\u0027s succinct description of what his jail cell allowed him to do and of what true leadership really is. Let\u0027s examine ourselves by these simple words. And let\u0027s ask these questions of both ourselves and of our political leaders -- especially as we go to vote.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersI am a millennial, a staunch believer in science and I think it is a shame that this man will be given an opportunity to chair a committee whose central jurisdiction is that of science.Former Coordinator, Value Chain Outreach and Responsible Care for the American Chemistry Council (ACC)In her latest blog at the A.V. Club, Cameron Esposito says that little gay kids push the boundaries of gender on Halloween out of a necessity and a sense of survival. While I may not have recognized it at the time, or at least attached a label to it, I was one of those little gay kids who, as she says, felt something \"off about heteronormative culture\" and used the holiday to protest it.Associate Entertainment EditorIf the incumbents in Washington haven\u0027t been representing corporate interests effectively, it\u0027s hard to imagine who could. Both corporate profits and the personal wealth of the 1 percent soared in the aftermath of a financial crisis which left most Americans worse off than ever before.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourI can\u0027t help thinking about all those Halloween nights I missed because of what my parents believed about God.Associate Religion EditorThe brutal reality is that a GOP controlled Congress, a GOP White House, a lock down Supreme Court and a majority of GOP controlled state legislatures and governorships would pose something that America hasn\u0027t seen in decades.Author and political analystIt\u0027s a look at how our unemployment insurance system has failed to protect out-of-work Americans, how vast sectors of our economy fail to offer employees health coverage, and how wages have failed to keep up with the cost of living.Senior Policy Analyst at DemosNot long ago, success in business came from hoarding knowledge. Whether in departments, in groups, or in individual experts, the motivations were to keep information confidential and use it to gain an edge. Today, it is all about sharing.Academic, Researcher, Writer, EntrepreneurI can safely say Obama is only president in U.S. history whose approval rating dropped a single digit over a 10-month stretch and it was described as having \"plummeted.\"Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaFifty years ago this month, the school became the vanguard of the free speech movement when left leaning Mario Savio led a movement to challenge campus restrictions on free expression. This week\u0027s attempted revocation of HBO Real Time host Bill Maher\u0027s invitation to deliver the fall commencement threatened the institution\u0027s proud legacy.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityVoters in many communities continue to be subjected to wave after wave of negative political ads. The obvious solution is to take big money out of politics, but another tactic would be to promote bipartisanship, to somehow dispel the rancor between Democrats and Republicans. Is bipartisanship possible? Or is the U.S. too polarized?Berkeley writer, retired Silicon Valley executiveShe\u0027s now co-starring with Jake Gyllenhaal in a new movie titled Nightcrawler, which was written and directed by her husband, Dan Gilroy. The film deals with the underbelly of local news where morality is murky at best and anything that draws ratings is okay to air.PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorYou know, my parents serve our community too. My mother was a school guidance counselor in Charles County and my dad is a physician in Southern Maryland. I\u0027m sure if you got to know them, you\u0027d realize how wrong you are about your own people. And yeah, I say your own people, because whether you like it or not, we\u0027re just as American as you are.Reporter. Motivational speaker. A fire bender who focuses on battling human trafficking, fighting against injustice and seeking truth.Apparently it sucks to be a black gay guy. At least that is what \"Stevie\" over at gayguys.com claims in his post \"20 Reasons It Sucks To Be A Gay Black Man.\" I am over articles like this one, which measures our worth as gay men by white men\u0027s standards.Doctoral candidate in American studies, Saint Louis UniversityOne of the hardest parts of the writing process is getting honest feedback. Close friends and family think nothing of lying in order to spare your feelings about as little as a poem. So they\u0027ll sooner tell you that your baby is ugly than that they didn\u0027t like the manuscript you\u0027ve agonized over for two years.WriterI was unemployed and attending college. My husband was working full-time at just a few cents above minimum wage. We could barely afford ourselves.A break from the standard Halloween fare of mad slashers and paranormal infestations, the new film Horns brings a decidedly hometown slant to an examination of the good and evil that lives in all of us.Film journalistGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"REID\u0027S FINAL PUSH",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
