{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributor\u0027Tis the season to attack the Affordable Care Act, no matter if this one is a greatest hit from 2010. At issue is the president\u0027s claim when selling health care reform that if you like your current health plan, you can keep it. That point in turn was based on the provision that grandfathered existing plans in the individual market (neither employer-based or government provided) by granting exemptions from various standards and consumer protections that came into effect when the law was signed in 2010.

It offers the president not just a choice of policies, but a choice of friends, worldviews, styles.Comments (154)Jeremy ScahillJournalist; Author, \u0027Dirty Wars: The World Is A Battlefield\u0027No one can scientifically predict the future consequences of drone strikes, cruise missile attacks, and night raids. But from my experience in several undeclared war zones across the globe, it seems clear that the United States is helping to breed a new generation of enemies.Comments (38)The Daily MealTheDailyMeal.comSome of these drinks don\u0027t seem that difficult to make but when you\u0027re 20 customers deep on a busy Monday morning, we can imagine the baristas are pretty overwhelmed when it comes to the hidden menu. That didn\u0027t stop us from trying to find more drinks on the secret menu though.Comments (116)Dan GolemanAuthor, \u0027Focus: The Hidden Driver of Excellence\u0027At a time when the news offers a steady stream of ways people battle because of the differences between them, there\u0027s an antidote sorely needed: the understanding of the ways someone else shares our common human condition. Call it \"just like me.\"CommentsDouglas Anthony CooperNovelist, AmnesiaDays of lurid headlines have focused on the stolen child.
