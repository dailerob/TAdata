{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Executive Director of the American Civil Liberties UnionFear is toxic to a democracy. Fear divides. Fear overreacts. Fear discriminates. It\u0027s a lesson we\u0027ve learned throughout our history, from the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 to the imprisonment of Japanese Americans during World War II to the post-9/11 Patriot Act. And now in the aftermath of the Paris terrorist attacks, we\u0027re relearning that lesson again as some of our leaders put forth proposals that would undermine our commitment to a free, pluralistic, compassionate, and open society. But we don\u0027t have to give in to hate and fear. We don\u0027t have to compromise our beliefs in freedom and equality. Principle can defeat prejudice if we don\u0027t lose sight of what matters most: protecting the very values and rights that make us Americans, especially in the most trying of times.I\u0027m disappointed in you, Governor Snyder, for your heartless and un-Christian actions, and for joining in with at least 25 other governors who\u0027ve decided to block legal Syrian refugees from coming into their states. What you\u0027ve done is anti-American. This is not who we are supposed to be.Oscar and Emmy-winning DirectorI am sharing my secret in order to give Americans a face to place with the label \"illegal immigrant.\" You never hear our stories because we live in fear of getting thrown out of our homes. We are not numbers or aliens. We are your friends and your neighbors.Fitness industry professionalIf you\u0027re thinking about adopting a child, remember that it\u0027s a gift you\u0027re getting and it comes with just as much responsibility as if you had your child biologically. On top of that, it\u0027s a beautiful blessing that you were chosen to take care of this child and become his or her parent.Emmy and Tony Award-winning actress and singerThe best way to defeat bad religion is with good religion, and the better way to defeat religious fundamentalism is from within rather than trying to smash it from without.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersOn the day after the ISIS rampage in Paris I visited that tiny island, a stone\u0027s throw from the defunct Twin Towers, for solace, solidarity, and reflection. I was not alone. Here is a boy at the feet of Liberty, his youth a source of her vigor. He reads aloud a civic prayer so famous it ranks with \"we hold these truths...\" and \"I have a dream.\"Political theorist - Founding Director \"Civic Inquirer\" - author of \"Civic War and the Corruption of the Citizen\" \u0026 \"Abandoned To Ourselves\"Taking in Syrian refugees, all ten thousand of them, is a must if we are going to maintain our sensitivity to the needs of those who are depending on us, even if we are afraid to do it. Fear is necessary, but peddling it, as many politicians and military industrialists are, is not.Actress and authorTrump\u0027s outrageous idea of creating a Muslim database, Carson\u0027s ridiculous comparison between Muslims and dogs, Bush\u0027s Christian litmus test for Syrian refugees, and Cruz\u0027s politicization of the issue are all empowering ISIS. The terrorist attacks in France were horrific. But Americans should not react out of fear.Hofstra Journalism ProfessorOur previous national focus on economic inequality is being drowned out, at least temporarily, by incessant calls for boots on the ground, no-fly zones, embargoing Syrian refugees and demands for increased surveillance -- the stuff of which the right thrives upon. Will the Sanders campaign also become a casualty of the ISIS assaults?Author, \"Runaway Inequality: An Activist\u0027s Guide to Economic Justice\"The portraits of black professors, the ones that bring me and so many other black students feelings of pride and promise, were defaced. Their faces were covered with a single piece of black tape, crossing them out of Harvard Law School\u0027s legacy of legal scholarship.2L at Harvard Law SchoolCandidates for public office, especially at the state and national levels, are never asked this central question of politics: \"Since the people are sovereign under our Constitution, how do you specifically propose to restore power to the people in their various roles as voters, taxpayers, workers and consumers?\"Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorIn 2014, 35 transgender children were murdered. Today, on Trans Day of Remembrance, they are among those we mourn and remember -- people around the world should refuse to forget the young lives lost to prejudice and brutality.Professor of psychology at Curtin University in Perth, AustraliaHuman Rights Watch LGBT rights researcherThe narrative in the mainstream media is that ISIS are against us because they are Muslims, they hate us, they hate our way of life and so on, all against the West. Very rarely does the media talk about the suffering of the people in the Middle East at the hand of these terrorists.Author Sardar: From Afghanistan’s Golden Age to Carnage, Return to Kabul: An Afghan American\u0027s Odyssey in Afghanistan and Kandahar: Provincial Handbook. Former diplomat served in Afghanistan.Unions are one of the few groups advocating for the interest of working people. If we make it harder for unions to do their job, working people will lose a major ally in the fight to build an economy that works for everyone, not just the richest 1 percent.National President, American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIOThe Koch network\u0027s secret bank, \"Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce,\" spent big during the 2014 midterm elections, including bankrolling efforts to roll back Wall Street reform. The Center for Media and Democracy (CMD) has been digging into some of the Freedom Partner funding streams.The Center for Media and Democracy/ALEC ExposedIf we let fear guide us, then we have already lost. The United States of America was not founded on the principles of fear and fright. Our ideals should not be to enclose ourselves, shutter mosques, reject Arabs and Muslims or let the world fend for itself.Freelance WriterNihilism is the wrong word for ISIS. Extremist jihadism is a consequence of faith, not a consequence of losing faith.USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorIt would be easy to assume, given the ways Buddhist practice has been presented to its target market, that it revolves entirely around meditation: Health and well-being books, magazines and websites are lousy with images of smiling young women sitting blissfully on cushionsThe dharma teacher at DharmapunxNYC since 2005; visiting teacher at Zen Care \u0026 Against the Stream. Josh\u0027s talks: dharmapunxnyc.podbean.comThe meaning of Robert Kennedy\u0027s public life will continue to be contested. But on this day that would have been his 90th birthday, his legacy will remain strongly identified with the rejuvenating spirit of grassroots activism.Professor, historian, author\"Let\u0027s Change\" is an appealing slogan, but the question is \"change to what?\" It seems likely from the interests that Mauricio Macri represents, and his political orientation, that Argentina\u0027s poor and working people will bear the brunt of any economic adjustment.Co-director, Center for Economic and Policy Research, Washington, D.C.Readers -- and taxpayers -- should take these corporate connections into account when assessing the objectivity of pro-bomber pieces like the Mitchell Institute report. Of course, even interested parties can be right some of the time. But that is not the case with respect to the new bomber.Director, Arms and Security Project, Center for International PolicyWhile so much has changed for me and for our community, the world is still not a kind place for someone like me: an HIV positive, indigenous, immigrant and trans woman of color. What has gotten me this far and what inspires me to keep going is the resilience, creativity and tenacity of the trans and genderqueer community.Executive Director, Casa RubyCongress has taken numerous stabs at retreating from the premise that the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II was constitutional. However, the Supreme Court case that justified it, Korematsu v. United States, has never been overruled.Cincinnati attorney, officer in the US Army Reserve, and partner with the Truman National Security ProjectYou have the power to reverse the damage your predecessor\u0027s actions have caused for women like me who seek services from Planned Parenthood. I know I am not alone, Mr. Foley. There are thousands of us with an actual need for Planned Parenthood\u0027s services in mid-Missouri.Linguist, animal lover, civil rights activistAfter a horrific tragedy like the one in Paris, your work should not scream, \"Look at meeeee!\" You, as a journalist, are not the story.JournalistWhile states cannot refuse to admit refugees, they may make resettlement more onerous by denying resources, including housing assistance, to the federal government. If governors tried to block certain categories of refugees, they would be vulnerable to discrimination lawsuits.Professor, Thomas Jefferson School of LawPublic education should not mean that, if you are wealthy, you have greater access to our public schools.Community psychologist and educatorIf we had these 365 days flash before our eyes, those that would remain in our memories would not be the days that burned up in political fever, but those that gave a platform to everyday heroes.Editor-At-Large, HuffPost GreeceOf the four doctors who worked on me, not one had mental health screenings in place for their patients, except for asking if I had a history of depression, which I said I did, and that was that. None of the doctors suggested I consult a psychologist for what was clearly a psychological issue.Actor, StudentDespite the fact that much of Trumbo\u0027s work was plainly patriotic, his brief association with the American Communist Party prompted years of persecution. In the clip below, Cranston justifies how a person like Trumbo could simultaneously be both a communist and a patriot.PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorAmerica has already witnessed Hillary Clinton as Senator and Secretary of State; few can name any major foreign policy accomplishments. We can, however, name mistakes. Bernie Sanders is far more qualified to be president than Clinton or Trump, especially since he\u0027s foreshadowed the consequences of perpetual wars, and doesn\u0027t focus only upon the need to destroy our enemies.Columnist published in The Cleveland Plain Dealer, The Baltimore Sun, The Hill, Salon, The Jerusalem Post www.hagoodman.comGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
