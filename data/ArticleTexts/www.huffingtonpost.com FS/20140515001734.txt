{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Joseph C. WilsonCEO, JC Wilson International VenturesWhen Karl Rove decided that he would question whether the fall and concussion Hillary Clinton suffered in 2012 to try to disqualify her from consideration for the presidency, it was only his latest cynical move. That Rove is up to his old dirty tricks should come as no surprise. After all, his history of cheap shots, divisive wedge issues, and slanderous personal attacks has been well documented over the years beginning with the Watergate Report. My family knows what it is like to be dragged through Rove\u0027s sewer. In 2003, he was part of the cabal that betrayed my wife Valerie Plame\u0027s identity as a covert CIA officer, in order to distract attention from the George W. Bush administration\u0027s lies about weapons of mass destruction as justification for war with Iraq.Over the past seven years, I\u0027ve been allowed to observe and document the process of conceiving, curating, building, and now opening to the public the National 9/11 Memorial Museum.

It\u0027s not the first or last city to have heart-wrenching inequality tear at its fabric, challenge its values, test its support structures. But what\u0027s jaw-dropping to me is how openly, defensively, and critically technology folks demean those who are struggling.danah boydSenior researcher, Microsoft Research; Research Assistant Professor, New York UniversityAs commencement seasons go, 2014 has hosted an unusually high number of protests against accomplished individuals and government leaders invited to speak. Who\u0027s really at fault here?Tyler KingkadeAssociate Editor, The Huffington PostThere\u0027s not one Internet for deep-pocketed corporations and a separate Internet for everyone else -- there\u0027s the Internet, and it belongs to all of us.

And that\u0027s the way it should continue to be.Al FrankenU.S. Senator from MinnesotaAlthough he enjoyed a brief period of celebrity and notoriety in the 1960s and 1970s after his banned books were finally published in the US, today, more than thirty years after his death, Henry Miller remains a marginalized and largely forgotten American writer.Arthur HoyleAuthor of \u0027The Unknown Henry Miller: A Seeker in Big Sur\u0027The public\u0027s mood, despite years of attempts by most Republicans and many Democrats to placate them, is distinctly populist. And much of that populist sentiment is directed toward the financial institutions which have so badly damaged our economy.Richard (RJ) EskowSenior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourThe image of black masculinity as criminal and terrifying, remarkably uniform across video games and news media, led to me questioning and resenting my own blackness.Sidney FussellWriter, talker, thinker.By the time you read this, I will have changed my Facebook profile picture.

While, other times, the rejection is personal, possibly something you might have avoided.Susan P. JoyceEditor and chief technology writer, Job - Hunt.orgIn a voucher system, disabled students are not always given true choice, as no choice exists if private schools refuse disabled students\u0027 needed services.Shayna A.

I\u0027d say it means they are scared, and, after viewing the new film Fed Up, I can understand why.Nancy HuehnergarthPresident, Nancy F. Huehnergarth ConsultingAs many people exchange their well-worn student IDs for brand new alumni discount cards, they are being bombarded with information -- from credit card offers, to (hopefully) job offers, to advice from authority figures -- irrespective of their actual authority or right to dispense worldly wisdom.Ben Michaelis, Ph.D.Clinical psychologist; Author, \u0027Your Next Big Thing: 10 Small Steps to Get Moving and Get Happy\u0027; Co-founder, Downtown Clinicians CollectiveIf the recent uproar over the Clippers\u0027 Donald Sterling, Mozilla\u0027s Brendan Eich and RadiumOne\u0027s Gurbaksh Chahal has taught us anything, it\u0027s that, in this age of social media, the world sees the CEO as a key element of the brand, with the associated advantage and liability.Penny HerscherPresident and CEO, FirstRainDid you hear the one about Google being dead, walking dead, on life support, in a coma, finished, going away, and kaput?Matthew RappaportHuffington Post Fellow, Google+We know that a coordinated community response -- one that relies on partnerships with student groups, campus police, community victim services organizations, campus ministries, and school officials -- is what is required to turn the tide on this issue.Tony WestAssociate Attorney General of the United StatesMany of us start running long before we have children. Many also stop running after becoming parents due to the large time commitment both demand. But for those who have found a way to fit both into their lives, it\u0027s often obvious because, well, we get a little weird -- even for a runner.Audra RundleWriter, runner, mom, ultra marathoner, editorNo team in sports talks more about their history than the New York Yankees and that is why the decision to honor Tino Martinez and Paul O\u0027Neill with plaques in Yankee Stadium is so puzzling.
