{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"\"Sleep, grades, social life: pick two.\" This motto, or some version of it, can be heard on college campuses across the country -- it\u0027s yet more evidence, as if we needed any, that college students today feel as if they\u0027re in a no-win situation, forced to choose between sleep and life. That\u0027s a choice nobody should ever have to make. And that\u0027s why I\u0027m thrilled to announce The Huffington Post\u0027s Sleep Revolution College Tour, coming this spring to 50 campuses across the country, drawing on the latest science to raise awareness and spark a national conversation about the importance of sleep and the dangers of sleep deprivation.I know one visit, and one president, cannot erase the decades of history that have left so many Cubans in poverty or exile. But sometimes the most important changes begin with the smallest step.44th President of the United StatesChanneling Michel de Montaigne, when Trump says, \"I think you\u0027d have riots,\" he can claim (and does claim) that he is merely making a prediction, but his target audiences -- his detractors and his supporters -- will hear the prediction as a threat and an invitation respectively.Davidson-Kahn Distinguished University Professor and Professor of Law at Florida International University; Floershimer Distinguished Visiting Professor of Law at Cardozo Law SchoolIf Trump is the nominee, the establishment Republicans will very likely mount a third party campaign. Conversely, if Trump has the most delegates and he is denied nomination, he will very likely run as an independent. So expect a three-way race, one way or the other.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Once again, the contraception benefit in the ACA is before the Supreme Court on Wednesday. What\u0027s at stake this time is every bit as critical as what was at stake in Hobby Lobby.Deputy Legal Director of the ACLU and the Director of its Center for LibertyThird parties have rarely taken over from the dominant two in American history. So how did the People\u0027s Party win the U.S. presidency and a majority of both houses of Congress in 2020? It started four years before, with the election of 2016.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027For all of his bravado, obnoxiousness, hatred, and vitriol, the scariest thing about Trump to me is his unique combination of ignorance about the world, convolved with ignorance about himself.Director of the Origins Project at Arizona State University; Author, \u0027A Universe From Nothing\u0027It\u0027s stunning that so many who are charged with the responsibility of leaving behind a better world for their children and grandchildren, are so complicit in the rise of a man whose political legacy in America will be one of hate, anger and violence.President and CEO, Endeavor Strategic CommunicationsSaudi Arabia\u0027s pathetic effort to convince the American public that it is a force for tolerance and stability in the world continued in a laughable op-ed published on this site just over a week ago.9/11 ActivistAdvisory Board Member, National Air Disaster Alliance/Foundation; Board Member and Founder, Housing Our Nation’s Outstanding Returning ServicemenProfessor in Department of Molecular Pharmacology, Albert Einstein College of MedicineThere are plenty of high-minded reasons to follow campaign news. It informs us about the issues. It educates us about the candidates. It makes our choices meaningful. It makes us a polity, not puppets. But does that describe the campaign news you\u0027re consuming?USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorAmericans have gotten themselves worked into a lather about immigration. Cynical politicians have stirred emotions with telling effect. Perspective and proportion are the casualties. Let\u0027s face the uncomfortable truth: immigration is a problem for which there is really no satisfactory solution.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghNearly a year ago, the eyes of the world turned to Baltimore City. People caught a glimpse of how poverty can ravage a community. Baltimore may have brought these struggles to the fore. But no older American city can escape the wrenching effects of inter-generational poverty.Candidate for Mayor and Former Mayor of BaltimoreWill this trip help push Cuba toward becoming a more open and democratic society? Again, I believe it will. America is always at its best when we lead by our example as the world\u0027s most successful democracy.U.S. Representative for Minnesota\u0027s 8th congressional districtIt has become typical of Europe to proceed one step at a time -- often with delays and without a long-term plan.Editor-At-Large, HuffPost GreeceNeither President Obama nor President Castro will hold office in two years. Thus, the rapprochement between the two nations is part of their presidential legacies. And they intend their policies to last.Associate Professor of Business at Dalhousie University in Halifax, CanadaThe deal calls up memories of Europe\u0027s checkered history of deal-making with Turkey. The parallels are unsettling, to say the least.Polonsky Fellow, Van Leer Jerusalem InstituteEach year, more than 600,000 individuals return to our neighborhoods after serving time in federal and state prisons, and another 11.4 million individuals cycle through local jails.83rd Attorney General of the United StatesAs President Barack Obama landed in Havana yesterday, the first sitting U.S. president in nearly 90 years to visit Cuba, he did so with his work cut out for him.Political Director, #CubaNowAt the Alliance for Workers Against Repression Everywhere (AWARE), we are working to expose U.S. trade relations with companies like Qatar Airways and countries like its namesake that abuse their workers and deny their human rights. That\u0027s why we\u0027re calling for a boycott.Co-Founder, Democracy PartnersWhy are we at such a loss for words when it comes to women touching themselves, but for men there are literally thousands of terms at their fingertips?Writer. Seeker. Smart-ass. Blogger at Sum of My Pieces.The situation in Flint is largely about what happened between state and local leaders. And when it comes to the question of government trust, trust has effectively been destroyed there.Associate Director, Poverty to Prosperity Program at the Center for American ProgressEvery time I reflect on my experience with TB I, without hesitation, think about the wonderful people in my life and feel a great sense of gratitude. My loved ones have relentlessly supported me and have always, always tried to shield and comfort me from struggle and sufferingTibetan American graduate student living with TBIs it just me, or has the term \"housewife\" taken on a less-than-desirable meaning in the modern world?Passionate ponderings from a curious mind...The best sports weekend of the year is officially in the books and just like every previous first weekend of the NCAA Tournament, this one was perfect. As per usual we had drama that couldn\u0027t be scripted and one wild finish after another.Traveler - Utrip.com, Body Double - Magic MikeFears of being crushed by debt or of falling off the economic ladder are pressuring students to conform, and we must find ways to counteract these pressures or we risk undermining our scientific productivity as well as our broad cultural creativity.President, Wesleyan UniversityPresident Roosevelt maintained a studied neutrality toward the Spanish Civil War that he would later regret. Texaco, on the other hand, went to war.Author, \u0027Spain in Our Hearts: Americans in the Spanish Civil War, 1936-1939\u0027Our elite class loves to explain to laid-off workers why their woes are their own fault. They don\u0027t have a college degree. They should have started their own companies. They\u0027re on drugs. They\u0027re too fat or lazy or dim to quickly adapt. Trump beckons... \"There will be so many jobs.\" \"It will be beautiful.\"Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureContemporary economics is often criticized for being too mathematical. How can we really capture the complex dynamics of what\u0027s happening in people\u0027s economic lives with a bunch of formulas?Fmr.
