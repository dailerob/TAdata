{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorI just read two sweeping reports on the state of income inequality in the U.S. and other advanced economies. Perhaps it\u0027s because I\u0027ve been so ensconced in fiscal cliff discussions, but I was struck by how much more alarmed policy makers are by the budget deficit than by the inequality situation. There are reasons for that tilt -- some good, some bad -- but based on magnitudes of the problem, it\u0027s far from clear that our current sole policy focus is warranted. Of course, many deficit scolds are motivated by anti-tax, anti-social insurance, and anti-government ideology, so they\u0027ve got a vested interest in the status quo. But we\u0027re not going to make much progress if policy makers continue to obsess so exclusively on budget deficits instead of the income deficits experienced by the poor and middle class.Read Post | Comments (709)Eric Whitacre, 11/23/12ComposerOur virtual family celebrates together, we mourn together, but through it all we are singing, connecting with each other in a way that only singing allows.

It appears that he has never surrendered the Revisionist Zionist goal of a Greater Israel, with an autonomous and pacified Palestinian population that submits to Israel\u0027s diktat.
