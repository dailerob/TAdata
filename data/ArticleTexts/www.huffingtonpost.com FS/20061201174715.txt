{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"APAPAPAPDuring his joint press conference with Maliki, President Bush\u0027s main theme was democracy -- he returned to it again and again. Well, if Bush is all about the Tenacious D(emocracy), why not have the Iraqi people hold a plebiscite on the most pressing question facing the country: Should the United States withdraw its troops from Iraq -- Yes or No? (Talk about your Pick of Destiny). It\u0027s been nearly a year since Iraqis last went to the polls. Twelve very long months in which a lot has happened.
