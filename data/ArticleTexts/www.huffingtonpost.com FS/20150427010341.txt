{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, the White House revealed it really does care about civilians being killed by drones -- at least when they\u0027re Americans or Westerners. On Thursday, President Obama expressed \"profound regrets,\" and described as \"uniquely tragic,\" a January drone strike in Pakistan that killed two al Qaeda-held hostages -- one American, one Italian. But while certainly tragic, it\u0027s far from unique. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism estimates that, under Obama, drones in Pakistan alone have killed between 256 and 630 civilians, with at least 66 of them children. In fact, the first drone strike of his presidency reportedly killed at least nine civilians. In the wake of this week\u0027s announcement, the president ordered a review of what lessons can be learned from these latest deaths. One we already know: Some innocent lives are apparently more valuable than others.If Bruce had told me about his gender issue when we first began getting romantically involved, I would not have married him. Pure and simple. But looking back, I\u0027m so grateful to God, the universe, and Bruce that I didn\u0027t know, and that Bruce played the role in my life that he did.Actress, Songwriter, Television PersonalityThe most important thing to note about Diane Sawyer’s Bruce Jenner interview is that his story is only one of many, and that those of us in the media have a duty to highlight the diversity of the trans experience.Senior Media Editor, The Huffington PostWhen we launched our What\u0027s Working editorial initiative, we knew we wanted to tell solutions-oriented stories using all the tools at our disposal on a global scale. So in addition to our original reporting and the robust conversations we\u0027re starting on the blog, we\u0027ve now launched the What\u0027s Working Honor Roll, a daily morning roundup of the best solutions journalism around the world.Can reasonable people disagree about the issues at hand in the TPP and TTIP? Absolutely. The president is wrong to suggest that his supporters in Congress and beyond are irresponsible when they question these agreements -- particularly given that his administration continues to keep them classified as a \"national security\" matter.Associate Professor of Law, Yale Law SchoolThe current sunset debate is our first opportunity as a society to grapple with the mass-surveillance programs revealed by Edward Snowden, and we can\u0027t afford to let this opportunity pass us by.Executive Director of the American Civil Liberties UnionChanging family dynamics, a shifting economic landscape, the surge of women into the workforce and public life are all adding pieces to the kaleidoscopic picture of what it means to be a man in America today. Begging the question: Just who is the 21st Century Man?Award-winning journalist, bestselling author and activistAuthor, All In: How Our Work-First Culture Fails Dads, Families, and Businesses -- And How We Can Fix It Together (see joshlevs.com)Unless we understand the powerful cultural forces behind the turn to violent extremism, we will fail to address the threat. When, as now, the focus is on military solutions and police interdiction, matters have already gone way too far. If that focus remains, we lose the coming generation.Anthropologist; Author, \u0027Talking to the Enemy: Faith, Brotherhood, and the (Un)Making of Terrorists\u0027How can cities rise to meet big new challenges -- and serve more and more people -- with resources that are always stretched thin? By finding smart ways to use a resource that is always growing: Data. And more and more cities are doing exactly that.Fmr. three-term mayor of New York City; Founder of Bloomberg Philanthropies and Bloomberg LPI am a free speech absolutist. Perhaps the biggest tragedy in the West today is the fact that freedom of speech is no longer a right that we can take for granted. It is now a privilege available only to those with armed security.Author, Heretic: Why Islam Needs a Reformation NowWhile many policies will be needed to improve the situation of the poor and middle class, there are three simple ones that could make a big difference: a more competitive dollar, a Federal Reserve Board committed to full employment and a financial transactions tax to rein in Wall Street.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027I have no idea what the Benghazi House Committee will find or conclude, but delaying their findings and conclusion until 2016 is wrong.Host, Fox News\u0027 \u0027On the Record With Greta Van Susteren\u0027East Coast citizens are crying out against the oil industry coming to their coast, but it seems that neither this -- nor the devastating impacts of the BP disaster -- are enough to protect them from offshore drilling activity.Actor; board member, OceanaCEO, OceanaThe contrast between the haves and have-nots might be especially stark at that New York building, but millions of families across the country are finding themselves on the wrong side of the poor door.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe Republican claims are laughable -- but the GOP budget cuts seeking to decimate the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy are deadly serious.Chair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusThe sad reality is that the United States government remains the country\u0027s largest low wage job creator. All those Senators tromping through New Hampshire promising to rebuild the middle class are part of a Congress that doesn\u0027t pay the workers who serve them enough to lift a family out of poverty.President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureTraditionally, fathers and daughters have struggled to regain the connection they shared when the girl was very young: the time of shoulder rides and tickle attacks. But fathers are learning to be role models for their daughters throughout adolescence and into adulthood.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarToday, on Earth Day, let\u0027s continue to protect ourselves, and ask our politicians to vote for policies that protect us. Included in that is a campaign to defeat the newest sponsor of terrorism -- climate change.Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranIncidents of child abuse are reported every 10 seconds, and each day five children die from child abuse. Around 3 million reports of child abuse are made each year, involving 6 million children. It\u0027s an epidemic that we must do more to confront.U.S. Senator from CaliforniaOn April 24, the arc of the moral universe will intersect with the 100th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide. Many will bear witness to that intersection, but official recognition of the genocide by the United States government will be sadly and conspicuously absent.U.S. Representative, Maryland\u0027s 3rd Congressional DistrictWe must continue to fight for the rights of workers everywhere by ensuring that no one should be coerced or forced into unsafe work - especially not children - because that is all that is available to them. The children of the Rana Plaza disaster should be managing the factories of the future and their children should have options that those brave men and women never dreamed of. We will not get there until we ensure that all children everywhere have access to an education.Co-Founder, A World at School; Executive Chair, Global Business Coalition for EducationConfession time. Yes, LGBT people are absolutely making a choice. They are choosing to be the most honest, authentic versions of themselves. The only relevant choice for straight Christians is whether we are willing to examine both our personal opinions and our theology accordingly. The choice is ours.Rogue Pastor and WriterThis day, when girls were seen and heard, changed many lives, as I\u0027ve come to know through the years. The program also brought about an amazing bond between fathers and daughters who spent the day in the place where those dads spent most of their waking lives.Founder, Take Our Daughters to Work Day; Honorary Founder and President Emerita, Ms. Foundation for WomenWe are at a crossroads. The Republican budget seeks to destroy the legislative legacy of 1965 that made great differences in the lives of so many ordinary people. Democrats must defend our proud legacy and fight against the efforts of those who seek to devalue the worth of hardworking Americans.Representing South Carolina’s 6th Congressional DistrictPresident Obama is willing to commit military resources to back up the Saudi war on Yemeni rebels. But when it comes to their war on women, like every U.S. president before him, the Supreme Commander is missing in action.Money Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsFor the past 70 years, the World Bank has strived to foster worldwide economic development, all while taking care not to cause undue harm in its wake. It has had some great successes and some humbling defeats. Now, in 2015, it\u0027s time the Bank makes good on its promise to ensure women are not harmed by but rather can contribute to and benefit equally from Bank investments.Executive Director, Oxfam InternationalConcealing potentially job-killing trade schemes from the American public thwarts democracy. Rushing unpopular legislation through Congress before American citizens have an opportunity to review it and tell their elected representatives how they feel about it obstructs democracy.International President, United SteelworkersI\u0027ve been thinking about the unsung birth heroes. I\u0027ve been thinking about the birth stories that don\u0027t necessarily receive all the thumbs up and high fives and Facebook shares. I\u0027m thinking about the cesarean section stories and the brave women who birth their children with such strength and beauty.Monet Moutrie is a writer and birth photographer based in Colorado. She co-founded cord, a birth and pregnancy blog.Appreciate him while you can.Senior Sports EditorWomen, frustrated by the gender discrimination, harassment and absurd beauty standards channel their anger toward other women. It\u0027s easier to judge a colleague than to fight against patriarchy. But feminism cannot evolve unless we stop seeing our differences as points of conflict.Blogs Editor, Huffington Post CanadaThe problem with using crime as a rationale for owning guns is that violent crime in the United States keeps going down. For that matter, so does the percentage of older, white men, who just happen to be the demographic that buys and owns most of the guns.Mike the Gun GuyGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"RACE AGAINST TIME",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
