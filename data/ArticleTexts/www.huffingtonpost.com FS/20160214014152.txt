{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"CEO, William Morris Endeavor EntertainmentWhatever our opinions of the candidates -- whatever we think of Trump or Cruz or Sanders -- whatever we think is wrong about our political system, we should all at least feel good that there is very little apathy in this campaign, and that it\u0027s bringing even young adolescents into the political conversation.Bernie Sanders has been unfairly criticized for being a \"Johnny One Note\" on foreign policy because he continually reminds voters of his early opposition to the Iraq War. To explain why he continues to emphasize the importance of his decision to oppose that war, Sanders has pointed to the speech he gave back in October 2002 in which he laid out five important reasons why he feared the Bush Administration\u0027s march to war. Critics and cynics have flippantly dismissed his understanding in foreign affairs and have, therefore, ignored that important speech. Because it was so prescient, it deserves attention, not scorn. Here, in short, were the five reasons he gave in 2002 for opposing the Iraq War.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Transforming movements towards social justice depend on the work of a core group of committed and persistent and not always frontline soldiers -- women and men who seize the moment and choose to stand up for what is right.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundIt may be true that, as Hillary Clinton stated, \"One vote in 2002 is not a plan to defeat ISIS.\" But the real issue is whether or not Americans should entrust someone who helped facilitate the rise of ISIS with a plan to counter that threat.Author, \u0027Dangerous Ground\u0027Journalists and pundits had been waiting for it for months: a win for Sanders and Trump in the same primary. Then they could finally rehash their \"rise of populism\" articles. And we were not disappointed after the New Hampshire primariesAssociate Professor in the School of Public and International Affairs at the University of GeorgiaIt is simply not enough to proclaim that all black lives matter when clearly not all black bodies matter in our collective conception and articulation of black liberation. Our conception and articulation of black liberation currently suffers from a profound failure to engage disability as a site of struggle, resistance and transformation.Head of Amnesty International\u0027s Youth Engagement Work for AfricaWe love you both for very different reasons - and it\u0027s causing us conflict. We don\u0027t want to have to choose between you, but only one of you will end up actually becoming the Democratic nominee. So why not combine forces and truly make this a win-win for the Democrats, the country - and yourselves?Entrepreneur, Strategist, LawyerInspired by the film maker\u0027s own struggles overcoming bipolar disorder, Paul Dalio wrote, directed, edited and scored his feature film debut which also includes performances by Griffin Dunne, Christine Lahti and Bruce Altman.Filmmaker, \u0027Touched with Fire\u0027Besides winning the New Hampshire Democratic Primary by a wider than expected margin, Bernie Sanders just made history.Former Executive Producer at TechCrunch TV.You may remember the Clinton campaign circulating a photograph of Barack Obama wearing a turban in an effort to portray him as a Muslim sympathizer. It was a little push to stoke the xenophobia and paranoia. The Clinton campaign recently tried the same tactic with Bernie Sanders.Richard Zombeck is a freelance writer and a podcaster at TandZTalk.com.What if Biden had run? What if Trump had won Iowa, especially by a wide margin? What if Bloomberg were to run? The biggest \"what if\" is almost unmentionable.Chair of the Board at Refugees InternationalWhere to Invade Next is Michael Moore\u0027s most disturbing film yet. Contrasting the progressive public policies practiced abroad with those here at home, Moore starkly drives home just how inhumane American society has truly become.Professor, historian, authorI fear that the new voters who see Bernie Sanders as their savior are coming to view the rest of the Democratic party and those of us who have long worked to achieve it\u0027s goals as the enemy.Actress, founding member of MOMENTUMSome decisions have repercussions that can last a lifetime. Most of these decisions are made daily, and they require focus and perspective to keep them from haunting you.Author of #1 bestselling book, Emotional Intelligence 2.0, and president of TalentSmart, world\u0027s leading provider of emotional intelligence.Syrians are waiting. Everywhere. Waiting for the next airstrike. Waiting to cross another border. Waiting for a smuggler to call back to to say if there is room on the rubber dinghy, or worse, if they will have to sail it. Waiting to be rescued in the middle of the sea. Waiting to die ... of starvation.VICE Correspondent \u0026 Emmy-nominated JournalistWith the primary season now finally and officially underway, and with Senator Bernie Sanders\u0027 stunning victory in New Hampshire still registering on the political seismograph, I\u0027ve been wondering what Bayard Rustin would make of it all.Author/Professor, Miami University, Oxford, OhioThe Clintons are insiders now, their personal wealth of over $50 million derived nearly entirely from the wealthy and powerful. And it shows. Hillary\u0027s gradualism in health care carefully protects health-related industries. Her proposals for financial regulation do not include putting executives in jail, or confiscating the wealth they obtained by theft.It saddens me that progressives now have to put pen to paper to defend Alan Grayson; a man who has not only proved himself the most effective Liberal in the House - having passed more legislation promoting progressive causes than anyone else - but the most effective Congressman, period, having passed more legislation than any member of Congress from either party.Attorney, writerThere have been many scientific highlights of physics and astronomy in recent years: the Higgs Boson, landing a probe on a comet, and an amazing fly-by of Pluto. But all this is dwarfed by what has been announced this week. A new era of science has begun.Astronomer; Director of the Dunlap Institute for Astronomy and AstrophysicsWhat\u0027s better than a box of chocolates on Valentine\u0027s Day? A homemade chocolate dessert, of course. From Chocolate Bread Pudding to Chocolate Cupcakes to Chocolate Cream Pie, these desserts are sure to make your sweetheart swoon.Chef, Recipe Developer and Busy MomDoughmamma is celebrating it\u0027s one year anniversary this Valentine\u0027s Day at Doughmamma.com and on the wonderful Huffington Post! As a thank you to Doughmamma readers, we will be giving away an organic baking box to one lucky winner announced March 1st, 2016.Private chef, culinary school graduate and second-generation foodieThe latest round of trash talking between GOP contenders Donald Trump and Jeb Bush has particularly focused on the other\u0027s mental health, if in an entirely juvenile sort of way. This, unfortunately, is the most common format in which mental health is referenced.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarWhile the United States has been distracted by Russia and the Middle East, China is quietly considering putting its nuclear arsenal on high alert. That could spell trouble.Senior Writer, Union of Concerned ScientistsAll mothers who have lost their beloved children share the same pain and no matter what image or label the media, politicians or the powers that be assign, their lives will never be the sameSpokesperson, Parents Circle - Families Forum (PCFF)Celebration and distraction are not the same thing. Taking time to step back from our difficult realities to rejoice, heal and love together is crucial. Investing in corporate fantasies and confusing them with our movements is detrimental.Activist, artist, and youth workerBernie Sanders is far too easy on Hillary Clinton in their debates. Clinton flaunts her record and experience in ways that Sanders could use to expose her serious vulnerabilities and disqualifications for becoming president.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorThe secret for our national future in this troubled world is to be the west in the east and the east in the west. Comfortable and conversant with the multiple cultures of our region, and respectful of their diversity. Just as we are comfortable and engaged with the multicultural society we have become at home.Prime Minister of Australia (2007-2010)What I keep hearing is that more than outright hostility, a huge piece of the white church\u0027s complicity in America\u0027s original sin comes down to indifference to others. Indifference to the experience and sufferings of their black neighbors and even black brothers and sisters in churches -- including indifference to those \"prophets who cry out.\"Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersThis week\u0027s KCRW podcast \"Scheer Intelligence\" features Truthdig editor and host Robert Scheer in conversation with Nomi Prins, author, journalist and former investment banker, who explains the culture of Wall Street and its influence on government.Editor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027They Know Everything About You\u0027He\u0027s said to be a brilliant orator with a sharp legal mind. But his expression unsettles me. I realize my reaction is visceral and automatic, but as a neurologist it is my business to notice things out of the ordinary and probe them.NeurologistYesterday Charles Blow wrote a column in the Times headlined, \"Stop Bernie-Splaining to Black Voters,\" and it made me think about how the same arrogance is coming from straight supporters of both candidates to LGBT voters.Queer Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
