{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"On behalf of The Huffington Post and TED, we are delighted to invite you on a year-end journey of ideas that can help shape the world in 2012. Starting today, we will be counting down 18 of 2011\u0027s most impactful TEDTalks -- and combining them with new blog posts written by the people who delivered them. TED stands for technology, entertainment and design, but the content has become much broader than that. The talks you\u0027ll be seeing touch on science, business, global issues, education, and much more. Picking the 18 wasn\u0027t easy. For the TED team, it was like being asked to name their favorite child. And this year, they had over 300 kids to pick from. But they finally managed to come up with their selections. Watch them, comment on them, and pass them along. An idea is one gift that you can hang onto even after you\u0027ve given it away.Read Post | Comments (32)Kevin Slavin, 11/30/11Founder, Area/CodeIn staring down a Genetic Algorithm, you are staring down the larger questions of what happens when no one is driving, no one is editing, a world without supervision. A world in which darlings die because they fail a fitness test. Not because anyone killed them.Read Post | CommentsJason Linkins, 12/ 1/11Editor, Eat the PressI wish our senators all the best in their attempt to manufacture Christmas cheer, but what I\u0027d really like to know is how I can get hooked up with the Federal Reserve\u0027s \"Secret Santa\" exchange, which seems much, much cooler.Read Post | CommentsElton John, 12/ 1/11Singer/songwriterIt\u0027s a time to reflect on the fact that we all have a role to play in ending the AIDS epidemic.

Wedel, 12/ 1/11Author, \"Shadow Elite\"This technology-driven, partly outsourced, too-big-to-fail bureaucracies of today are more difficult to maneuver than that of yesteryear.
