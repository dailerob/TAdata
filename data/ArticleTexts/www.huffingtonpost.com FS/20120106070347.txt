{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"I\u0027m delighted to announce the launch of our newest section, HuffPost Science, a one-stop shop for the latest scientific news and opinion. From the farthest reaches of space to the tiniest cells inside our bodies, HuffPost Science will report on the world\u0027s greatest mysteries, most cutting-edge discoveries, and most thought-provoking ideas. The section will also be home to a robust debate on issues great and small -- from the Big Questions of our time (are we alone in the universe?), to quirky, fun ones (will they ever create a pill that will let me eat all the pistachio ice cream I want and not gain weight?). At its core, HuffPost Science will be a place for all of us, no matter our beliefs or leanings, to zero in on traits we have in common -- especially our thirst for knowledge, and our boundless curiosity. Check it out and let us know what you think.Read Post | Comments (159)Richard Branson, 1/5/12Founder, Virgin GroupSpace tourism may seem like an excuse for joy rides for the rich, but in reality it\u0027s the start of a new and vital private sector industry that will help develop safer, cheaper and cleaner space travel and result in technology that will lead to broader innovation and discovery.Read Post | Comments (158)Jason Linkins, 1/5/12Editor, Eat the PressThe close second-place Iowa finish has given Rick Santorum\u0027s candidacy new life, but he is now playing catch-up with the new top tier.
