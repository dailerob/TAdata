{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonRobert Greenwald\u0027s Brave New Foundation\u0027s recent video on the U.S. \"signature\" drone attacks gives us a glimpse, even if the White House won\u0027t, of what\u0027s being done in our name. \"We are working,\" Greenwald told me, \"to use the video to get Congress to introduce legislation to ban signature strikes.\" So watch it, and then start the debate the president claims to want. The missiles from the drones might be exploding in Pakistan and Afghanistan and Yemen, but the fallout will impact us here at home for years to come.Comments (91)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Harry Reid may now be able to summon 51 votes to abolish the filibuster, at least for cabinet officials and other high-level policy makers. But that shouldn\u0027t be considered a victory. It\u0027s a sad commentary on where we\u0027ve come to.Comments (149)Martha BurkMoney Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsThe Lone Star State attack on women was just the latest in what is looking more and more like the new McCarthyism. It\u0027s a simple formula. If women speak up for their rights, label them nazis and terrorists -- and if you can get other women to do it, so much the better.Comments (320)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesSo if Perry is stepping down to focus on a presidential run, as some observers contend, what will that mean for GOP political gay-bashing in 2016 race? Judging from Perry\u0027s most recent rants, 2016 will be 2012 redux, no matter what any autopsy of the 2012 election by the RNC or GOP strategists might reveal.Comments (134)Betty Sue FlowersScenario WriterProperty is a thing. Happiness is an ideal, a story of the future created by the imagination. The American Dream, even when it takes material form, is a wish the heart makes in its pursuit of happiness.CommentsAdam GrantWharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027Think about the last time you waited for 45 minutes at a restaurant, and there was no sign that your table would be ready in the near future. You should have probably headed to another restaurant, but you\u0027d already waited 45 minutes, so how could you leave?Comments (62)Russell SimmonsFounder, GlobalGrind.comIf George Zimmerman had rights, so did Trayvon Martin. And that is why Mr. Zimmerman was properly arrested and charged with murder in the second degree. He will soon be judged by a jury of his peers, and that is the best we can do.Comments (4,370)Jonathan WeilerDirector of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel HillFor a clear sense of what the Republican Party has in store for the entire country, were it able to get its clutches on all the levers of power, North Carolina is becoming an increasingly illuminating place to look. In six short months, the party has cut a swathe of destruction through the state.Comments (74)Nikolas KozloffAuthor, \u0027Revolution! South America and the Rise of the New Left\u0027It seems that the Snowden saga may exert a profound impact upon diplomatic relations at the global level. In yet another bombshell, Snowden disclosed sensitive NSA files relating to Brazil. Despite outrage, however, reaction within the Rousseff administration has been decidedly muted.CommentsFoodbeastGrowing up Asian-American, it was always hard not to feel just a little bit different from your peers, especially at lunchtime. While your classmates were knocking back Capri Suns and Dunkaroos, you\u0027d be stuck drinking probiotic Yakult and eating Hello Panda crackers.CommentsGeorge WentworthSenior Staff Attorney, National Employment Law ProjectIn an increasing number of states, the perceived \"problem\" is no longer \"unemployment\" -- it\u0027s the \"unemployed.\" And the most convenient and politically facile way to attack the unemployed is to attack unemployment insurance.Comments (106)SmarterTravelSmartertravel.comFrom terrifying tales about airplane bathrooms to mid-flight door-opening fears, there are a lot of myths about air travel flying around out there. Here are 10 urban legends that just aren\u0027t true.Comments (173)Sen. Dianne FeinsteinU.S. Senator from CaliforniaWhy does the cultivation of poppy -- the plant used to produce heroin -- in a faraway land matter? Simply put, the illicit drug trade in Afghanistan finances terrorist activities of the Taliban.Comments (53)Jeffrey SachsDirector, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \"To Move the World: JFK\u0027s Quest for Peace\"American politicians and pundits know almost nothing about Egypt but were quick to endorse the military coup against Morsi. The reason is Islamophobia: the biased U.S. presumption that Morsi\u0027s fall is simply the result of Islamist authoritarianism. The truth is a little more complicated.Comments (106)Robin O\u0027BryantBlogger, Robin\u0027s ChicksI am over trying to look cute at the pool. I am no longer worried about having raccoon eyes from ridiculously large sunglasses. If it will help to slow the hands of time and the inevitable arrival of my crow\u0027s feet, then sign me up.Comments (33)Chris WeigantPolitical writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comAs coups go it was a fairly restrained one, but celebrating a populist/military overthrow of a democratically-elected leader is an unusual stance for Americans to take, for obvious reasons. Even if we do like the new guy. Which brings us to a few lessons Americans find very hard to accept.CommentsChris EyreDirector, \u0027Smoke Signals\u0027Since the beginning of the moving image, Hollywood has created and appropriated its very own image of Native America that was always made by non-Native Americans for their own political point of view towards the masses. Well, how do Native people feel about the new The Lone Ranger, you ask?Comments (37)Dawn TurnbooMilitary wife, sales associateEven though I sent him pictures of my changing body, I was still really nervous to see him in person again. What would his reaction be? Would he like my new body? He came home in December 2012, just before Gage\u0027s first birthday, and at 142 pounds, I weighed less than I did on the day we met.CommentsSusan Rebecca WhiteAuthor, \u0027A Place at the Table,\u0027 \u0027A Soft Place to Land\u0027 and \u0027Bound South\u0027If we really want to turn this public scandal into an opportunity for growth, we should take the spotlight off Ms. Deen. Turn away from the tearful confessionals and interviews. There are better southern cooks, like Edna Lewis, more deserving of our attention. Look toward them.Comments (34)Ian DoescherAuthorWriting William Shakespeare\u0027s Star Wars was a fun exercise in mixing just the right amount of the Bard with just the right amount of everyone\u0027s favorite galaxy far, far away.CommentsDr. Judson BrewerAssistant Professor of Psychiatry, Yale School of MedicineSo, if fear helps motivate us, what\u0027s wrong with injecting a bit of fear into our lives, so that we improve them? First, we can examine how well fear works as a motivator, and then see how it trips us up.CommentsGalip DalayPolitical researcher, SETA Foundation in TurkeyThe Islamist identity of Morsy and his party seems to be the major reason for the reticence of the international community and media in defining this coup a coup.Comments (636)Sarah BrownFounder, A World at SchoolEducation is relatively inexpensive in the developing world, and fosters citizens who can contribute to their local economy, raise healthy families and ensure a safer, less militant society.Comments (12)Steph GuthrieFeminist advocate and community managerDid you know that women are people who sometimes make and/or produce music?

Like people everywhere, the workers of Bangladesh need jobs and a safe place to work.CommentsKenny Neal ShultsStand-up comedian and principal, Connected Health SolutionsIf there\u0027s any place that can offer gay people a voice and an opportunity to make fun of ourselves instead of everyone else doing it for us, it\u0027s The Daily Show. The introduction of a \"senior gay correspondent\" is not only belated but a perfect way to herald in this seeming Gay Spring.Comments (12)Robert ScheerEditor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027Embarrassingly, our law professor president refuses to label the arrest of Egypt\u0027s freely elected president by the military a coup because that would trigger an end to the $1.5 billion in U.S. aid as a matter of law.Comments (401)Elissa StraussBlogger and essayistBasically every person a pregnant women meets has some idea or tip about what you should and shouldn\u0027t do with your baby. When I was pregnant, I got advice from cab-drivers, relatives and the tower of books I read, in horror, late into the night the month before I gave birth.Comments (115)Barbara Ross MillerVice President of Consumer Marketing Solutions, Sony Electronics Inc.I\u0027ve found my inspiration in other women. Some of them have passed through and others have become a part of my life, either professionally or personally.CommentsHarvey WeinsteinFilm ProducerIf we run ads with The Butler, the MPAA is imposing $25,000 a day in penalties. We have to pull 5,000 trailers from the theaters, we have to pull our website down, all of which we complied with. What the hell do they need the title for?Comments (96)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027It is widely recognized that economists are not very good at economics.
