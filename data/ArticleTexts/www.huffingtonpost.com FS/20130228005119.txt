{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This past weekend I went to Disneyland. Not the actual Disneyland, but my version of Disneyland. It was a conference called \"Wisdom, 2.0,\" which is designed to address \"the great challenge of our age: to not only live connected to one another through technology, but to do so in ways that are beneficial to our own well-being, effective in our work, and useful to the world.\" We all know that technology is taking over practically every aspect of our lives -- mostly for the better. But there is also a growing awareness that our increasing dependence on technology puts us at risk of becoming disconnected from ourselves. As Wisdom 2.0\u0027s founder and host Soren Gordhamer put it, \"We\u0027re done with this honeymoon phase and now we\u0027re in this phase that says, \u0027Wow, what have we done?\u0027 It doesn\u0027t mean what we\u0027ve done is bad. There\u0027s no blame. But there is a turning of the page.\"Read Post | CommentsSugata Mitra, 02/27/132013 TED Prize winnerWe need a curriculum of big questions, examinations where children can talk, share and use the Internet, and new, peer assessment systems.

Keith M.D., 02.12.2013Gastroenterologist, AGA, ASGE, ASPENLactose intolerance -- it\u0027s a term we hear used often, especially when discussed among issues like stomach aches and food intolerances such as Celiac disease. But what does it really mean? Who and how many of us are actually affected by it? And does it mean you need to eliminate any foods from your diet?Read Post | Comments (3)Mark Ridley-Thomas, 02/27/13Supervisor for the Second District in Los Angeles CountyThe era of segregationist governors standing publicly against integration may be long past. But as recent court cases show, less violent and more subtle efforts to thwart the will of voters are alive and well today and constitute a fundamental threat to democracy.Read Post | Comments (138)Howard Fineman, 02/27/13Editorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupIf the GOP is dragged to the negotiating table, will that lead to a so-called Grand Bargain? Will any resulting deal short-circuit the other pending disruptions or ease the gridlock that has turned Washington into a never-ending standoff? Or will it just make the atmosphere all the more toxic, resentful and angry?Read Post | Comments (1,486)Melani Robinson, 02/27/13Award-winning blogger, named one of the \"Ten Best Online Dating Experts,\" chronic smart ass.With over 100 dates under my belt, I recently concluded a year of online dating.
