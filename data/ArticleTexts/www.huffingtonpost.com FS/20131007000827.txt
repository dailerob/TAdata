{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week was dominated by the shutdown. It\u0027s as much a shutdown of the executive functions of the brain as it is of the government. A monument to monumental stupidity, it\u0027s also a shutdown of possibility, and of whatever residual trust the public still has in the American political system. Even those doing the right thing by fighting it were reduced by the sheer absurdity of the situation. All to try to reinstate a sequester-level budget that is itself horrifically self-destructive (note to media: the Affordable Care Act and sequester are the compromises, and bad ones, at that). That\u0027s right -- we\u0027ve now sunk to a level in which the merely horribly self-destructive is a goal that seems out of reach. So our leaders play games instead of even attempting to address the real problems, like the roughly 20 million unemployed or underemployed Americans. That\u0027s for August. The September numbers weren\u0027t released on Friday -- because of the shutdown.Comments (111)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027The Bible speaks clearly about the role of government, and that is what really is being challenged here. It\u0027s time for those people of faith who want to shut down the government to read their Bibles.Comments (614)Lisa BelkinSenior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, The Huffington PostThe events are all examples of what should be the fundamental responsibility of society -- supporting and protecting its most fragile citizens -- and how we are failing miserably at the job.Comments (416)Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoThe behavior of the House Republicans is nothing short of reprehensible. They are not only harming innocent government employees and damaging the nation, but they are also dishonoring the very spirit of their oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States.Comments (2,463)Arianna HuffingtonTo paraphrase Einstein, you can\u0027t solve a problem using the same type of thinking that created it. When you consider this bit of wisdom alongside the scale of the problems we\u0027re facing around the world, it\u0027s clear that our current model of leadership sorely needs a refresh.Comments (275)Kirk DouglasActorWhen you get to be 96 years of age the road ahead is short, so you look back at the road you have traveled for almost 100 years. The first thing you come up against is technology.Comments (421)Gary HartPresident, Hart International, Ltd.If you live in a vacuum-packed world of talk radio, right-wing dominated town halls, and campaigns financed by anti-government billionaires, and if that\u0027s the only Kool-Aid you drink, it must be a shock when you confront the real world. \"Why is this park closed?\" \"Because you closed it, Congressman.\"Comments (394)Esther PerelPsychologistAt the heart of sustaining desire lies a challenge. It demands that we learn to reconcile our fundamental need for safety and security with our equally strong need for adventure and novelty.Comments (464)Charles FergusonDirector, Wall Street documentary \u0027Inside Job\u0027; Author, \u0027Predator Nation\u0027I\u0027m cancelling my documentary about Hillary Clinton. It\u0027s a victory for the Clintons, and for the money machines that both political parties have now become. But I don\u0027t think that it\u0027s a victory for the media, or for the American people.Comments (1,259)Michelle ObamaFirst Lady of The United StatesThere\u0027s nothing more important than knowing that our families are healthy and happy. And after spending so much time with military families and hearing your stories of service and sacrifice for our country, I know that that\u0027s your priority as well.Comments (95)Sally SteenlandDirector, the Faith and Progressive Policy Initiative, Center for American ProgressModern Republicans\u0027 callousness and willingness to overburden the poor evokes another act of state villainy -- one that is especially pertinent because Republican leaders so often invoke the Bible.Comments (1,358)Norman LearFounder, People for the American WayI\u0027m a WWII veteran myself. I like that the men and women who served alongside me can visit the monument in their honor. But maybe a better tribute from our Tea Party politicians would be to step away from the cameras and end this shutdown that they themselves created.Comments (798)Diane RavitchHistorian, NYU professorWhen women speak plainly and mince no words, they are abrasive, harsh, and just plain -- well -- rude. The same people who object to my tone waste no time denouncing me in abusive language.CommentsDr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarWhile the media and many women\u0027s organizations focus on what is wrong with the lives of women executives (\"When you\u0027re a hammer, everything looks like a nail.\"), a new generation of women leaders are focusing on what is right.Comments (60)Donna HenesUrban shaman, eco-ceremonialist, ritual expert and consultantIt is our job to know what we want and what we like, and it is completely up to us to articulate our needs in such a way as to give them every chance of being met.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorI\u0027ve long stopped asking Congress to do anything to help the economy; I just want them to stop hurting it. It seems crazy to admit, but apparently that\u0027s too much to ask.Comments (38)Michele RedmonWriter, Military Wife, MotherAll relationships go through phases of attraction but when all is said and done who wouldn\u0027t want a good bagel?CommentsClaire FallonDeputy Blog Editor, The Huffington PostMany male protagonists seem palatable enough at first glance -- unless we hold them to the more exacting friendship standard.Comments (103)Abolhassan Bani-SadrFormer president, IranThe current attempt to shift Iran\u0027s nuclear policy is the latest desperate move by a regime seeking to ensure that any path toward normalization will be accompanied by a U.S. guarantee not to follow a policy of regime change.Comments (46)Jennifer GarnerActress; Save the Children Artist AmbassadorHaving a close network of fellow parents to lean on and learn from, not to mention a supportive family, has made parenting easier for me. Meanwhile, in isolated, poverty-stricken communities across America, too many moms and dads face parenthood all alone.CommentsMarian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundThis week there is some good news from D.C. in the midst of all the dismal Congressional news on the shutdown. Over the last several years, D.C. has made a series of decisions that have made the city a model of best practices for its youngest children.Comments (87)Sen. Bernie SandersIndependent U.S. Senator from VermontIt is unconscionable that in one of the most advanced nations in the world, there are nearly 50 million people who lack health insurance and millions more who have burdensome copayments and deductibles.Comments (1,356)Brittany GibbonsBlogger, \"Brittany, Herself\"Six hours later, I peeled the moist scuba suit from my body and collapsed on the floor. Filling my lungs to capacity for the first time since being seated on the groom\u0027s side. It burns. It burns so good.Comments (129)Russell SimmonsFounder, GlobalGrind.comIf the Republicans, specifically the members of the Tea Party, want to play games with our economy, he shouldn\u0027t give them an inch. Tell the Tea Party that they can\u0027t hijack our government and to take a seat. Stand strong, Mr. President, we got your back.Comments (421)Cecile RichardsPresident of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, \u0026 Planned Parenthood VotesThrough her historic, 11-hour filibuster, State Senator Wendy Davis gave a voice to the millions of people who have felt shut out of the political process. The fact is, women in Texas are suffering. Texas women deserve better -- and Texas can do better.Comments (319)Eduardo PaesMayor, Rio de Janeiro, BrazilThe digital revolution is allowing democracy to recall its foundations and evolution is modernizing and reinforcing our fundamental values. And we are only at the beginning of that journey.CommentsMichelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesThese candidates are promoted as progressives and sold as such to LGBT and progressive donors, disingenuously using their queerness during Democratic primaries as a way to give them street cred with progressives while their records and intentions are otherwise.Comments (92)Ann BrenoffSenior Writer, The Huffington Post\u0027It takes all kinds.\u0027 That\u0027s what my mother used to say with a shrug every time she encountered someone who behaved in a way she found offensive. I\u0027m a bit less tolerant than Mom was. For the occasions when forgiveness eludes me, I have created a few new Circles of Hell that Dante may have missed. Please add your own contributions in the comments below; here\u0027s my list.Comments (426)Alan ColmesLiberal political commentator, host of \"The Alan Colmes Show\" on Fox News Radio, publisher of alan.com, author of \"Thank the Liberals … For Saving America\"As childish and petulant as House Republicans are behaving, the actions of Republican state legislators with regards to Obamacare is even worse, as they have the power to immediately improve millions of lives, but are stuck in their ideology and hatred.Comments (400)J.D. RothmanBlogger, www.TheNeuroticParent.comSo, you\u0027re saying that most parents of new college students are spending all their time screening full seasons of missed TV shows at a time when they\u0027re supposed to be rekindling romance and traveling the world?Comments (19)David ArquetteActor, Mentor, \"Dream School\"In a world full of self-appointed and uncertified judges who wildly swing gavels while pointing their proverbial fingers at anyone that doesn\u0027t fit in, sentencing them to humiliation and ridicule regardless of the fact that their only crime is that of individuality.Comments (19)Michael Smerconish, 2013. 6.10David Wild, 2013. 6.10Hal Donahue, 2013. 6.10Kristen Houghton, 2013. 6.10Ernest Owens, 2013. 6.10Steven Conn, 2013. 6.10Bizzy Emerson, 2013. 6.10Frida Berrigan, 2013. 6.10Allison Tate, 2013. 6.10The Knot, 2013. 6.10Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"\u0027WE\u0027RE ON PATH\u0027 TO DEFAULT Boehner Threatens To Shoot The Hostage...
