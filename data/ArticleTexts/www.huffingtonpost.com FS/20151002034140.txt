{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Director of the Center for Peace and Spirituality and University Chaplain at Pacific UniversityIt has happened again. Mass shootings like the one today at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg happen too often and Oregon has not been immune. Today, we offer our prayers for those killed and injured. We also lift up the families of those impacted. Still, we must also work to take steps that reduce gun violence this day so that there are no more days like this. But we know there will be another day like this. Hope is not lost, however. The road forward might be difficult, but it is a road the American people must walk together to reclaim our safety from the NRA and manufactures of weapons and bullets that profit off the sin of mass murder.Until politicians in the U.S. are prepared to risk their own political scalp, stand up to the powerful gun lobby and even anger their own voting base to limit the general public\u0027s access to certain types of weapons, America will continue to drown in gun blood.Writer and Director of Public Affairs at the NSW Minerals CouncilIt is strange to watch the Republican Presidential debates or hear the candidates describe our country.

I wanted to be there for her as much as possible.ActressWhen I was growing up I had an unlikely pen pal in E.B. White, who passed away 30 years ago today.

But some had much better views than others.Senior writer, Moyers \u0026 Company on public TV. Senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.Though you might not know it from the incessant media coverage of his candidacy or his P.T. Barnum-ish self-glorification, there are plenty of pieces missing from his financial story that call into question both his skill as a dealmaker and his business acumen.Distinguished Senior Fellow, DemosFor Democrats, the sight of Biden in a crowd conjures a warmth the vice president clearly returns. But the central question is this: what, at its core, is the rationale for choosing Biden over Hillary Clinton?Novelist and contributing opinion writerIn corporate America, 88 percent of men think women have at least as many opportunities to advance as men. Yet when you look at the actual data, women\u0027s odds of advancement are 15 percent lower than men\u0027s. Why don\u0027t men see it?Wharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027Today, you can do your bit for 3 of the 17 Global Goals for Sustainable Development.

This struggle is much larger than me. We have seen our voting rights stripped right along with our humanity. And it is time that we join together to say, \"Enough is enough. We want justice -- or else!\"Founder of Garner Way Foundation and daughter of Eric GarnerPolitical Director for Garner Way FoundationExpect Twitter, Facebook, political blogs, editorial pages and our TV and radio talk shows to demand gun control. That happens every time there\u0027s a tragedy like this new one, and the talk always fades.Author, reviewer, and bloggerIn late 2014, I was working as a hotel manager at a popular Manhattan property. It was a job highly regarded by many. But I hated it. I hated what I had given up in order to have that secure salary.

Our market is valued at $1 billion a year. Now that legalization is happening, more of the marijuana sales are likely to occur on the legal market and the opportunity for growth is enormous.State representative, business attorney, and co-chair of Oregon Legislature\u0027s Marijuana Legalization CommitteeThe alarming thing - for those who live the church and know its social and institutional fabric - is the cynical and unscrupulous attempt to exploit the person of the pope in order to score a point in favor of the ideological opponents of the popeProfessor of History of Christianity, University of St. ThomasSince the American press largely ignored or downplayed the Pope\u0027s January 2015 Vatican visit with a transgender man from Spain, many Americans have nothing to counterbalance off the Pope\u0027s Kim Davis visit to understand that the pontiff\u0027s message is truly about the compassionate inclusion of all people.Cultural critic, essayist and novelist published with Parkett, Art in America and Bijutsu TechoJason Chaffetz Gets Owned by Cecile Richards; Carly Fiorina Caught Lying Again; Ted Cruz Makes Crazy Yalping Noises; Trevor Noah on The Daily Show; Bob\u0027s Russian Movers; and much more.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027The Bernie Sanders campaign has received a grand total of eight minutes of coverage -- one-fifth of Bush\u0027s time, or one-tenth of Clinton\u0027s time (one-twentieth, if you count the scandal coverage). Bernie got roughly the same amount of time as Chris Christie (polling below four percent).Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comReports say that there are more than 70,000 untested rape kits warehoused by 1,000 law enforcement agencies across the United States. The cause of the backlog must be addressed. There are innocents without defense. Victims without justice. Public safety at risk. It is a travesty.Criminal Defense AttorneyI\u0027ve realized that as our memory fades, photos become anchors to life events.

Religion and ethnicity play a significant role in the displacement. But ideology also has a hand in it.Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogWhat if Edward Snowden is correct to believe that it\u0027s \"completely ridiculous\" to think Clinton\u0027s emails were safe? It\u0027s logical to assume that national security was jeopardized if Snowden and others feel Clinton was reckless with her intelligence protocol.
