{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOWall Street is melting down, and McCain and the GOP have no credible response. Indeed, McCain is so clearly clueless on this issue, the current battle over who is best suited to deal with the financial crisis should be a rout. And, so far, Obama has shown not just an incomparably greater grasp of the situation and substantive policies to deal with it, but a real fire in the belly in going after McCain\u0027s vulnerable flank. But for Obama to show the kind of transformational leadership the crisis demands, he needs to do what so many of his critics have chided him for not doing: take a stand that puts him at odds with the establishment of his own party. He did it in 2002 with the war in Iraq. He can do it in 2008 with the economy.Read Post | CommentsBIOHarry Shearer, 09.18.2008Governor Jindal has noticed a disparity between the federal government\u0027s willingness to lift a recovery burden off the state of Texas and its refusal to do the same for Louisiana.Read Post | Comments (12)BIOHale \"Bonddad\" Stewart, 09.18.2008In other words, the CRA isn\u0027t even an issue. But that won\u0027t stop the the likes of Rush and his progeny from saying it over and over again until all sorts of people believe it.Read Post | CommentsBIODan Froomkin, 09.18.2008If the surge has worked, that must mean victory is just around the corner, right? That\u0027s certainly the impression that the Bush White House is trying to give -- without exactly coming out and saying so.Read Post | CommentsBIOJames P. Rubin, 09.18.2008What would happen if Palin were to ask for a briefing from former Republican Secretaries of State to prepare for her foray into foreign policy? She would learn that the McCain foreign policy has an extremist approach to Iran.Read Post | Comments (67)BIODavid Goldstein, 09.18.2008McCain surely knows that Zapatero is the president of Spain, and that Spain is part of Europe... that is, when he\u0027s lucid.Read Post | Comments (30)BIORep. Rush Holt, 09.18.2008It is no exaggeration to say that bolstering foreign language education for ensuing generations is vital to our nation\u0027s economic and national security.Read Post | Comments (39)BIOMax Bergmann, 09.18.2008This gaffe would seem to have very significant implications. Not knowing who the leader of Spain was or thinking Spain was in Latin America would not really be shocking coming from his running mate, but McCain has run on his foreign policy expertise.Read Post | Comments (198)BIOMax and the Marginalized, 09.18.2008It\u0027s often asked how Bush ran as an outsider in 2000 with better connections to classic Washington power structures than anyone and watching Sarah Palin, I finally see that he really was one.Read Post | CommentsBIORabbi Michael Lerner, 09.19.2008If Obama understood how to answer these blue-staters and their all-too-ready-contempt for the Americans who don\u0027t agree with them, he\u0027d have a far greater chance of winning this election.Read Post | CommentsBIOChris Kelly, 09.18.2008McCain will not only take on special interests and Washington insiders, he\u0027ll fundamentally alter human nature. And without raising taxes, either. He\u0027ll lead us to a sort of martial nirvana.Read Post | Comments (636)BIOJames Moore, 09.18.2008Don\u0027t let them tell you this economic meltdown is a complicated mess. It\u0027s not. Our national financial crisis is readily understood by anyone who has seen greed and hypocrisy.Read Post | Comments (514)BIORichard Gizbert, 09.17.2008Because Obama hasn\u0027t agreed to McCain\u0027s unprecedented town hall proposal, McCain is telling us Obama deserves what he\u0027s getting. John McCain\u0027s argument isn\u0027t just nonsensical. It\u0027s petulant.Read Post | Comments (304)Jim Wallis, 09.18.2008Bob Cesca, 09.17.2008Peggy Drexler, 09.18.2008Robert Kuttner, 09.18.2008Marty Kaplan, 09.17.2008Michael Weingartner and Lee Camp, 09.18.2008Steve Clemons, 09.18.2008Rocky Delgadillo, 09.18.2008David Donnelly, 09.18.2008Alexis C.
