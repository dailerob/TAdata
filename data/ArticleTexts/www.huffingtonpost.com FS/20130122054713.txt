{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupAs President Barack Obama sets off on his second-term journey, we wish him well. In the weeklong \"Road Forward\" series that ends today on Inauguration Day, we\u0027ve laid out the many challenges he faces to fulfill the promise of his presidency. We reminded him -- and ourselves -- that too much poverty and economic inequality remains; that too little progress on education, the environment and immigration has been made; that too many middle-class Americans are falling farther behind; that new laws are needed to translate into better health care and sound business regulation; that common sense is missing from our national budget; and that too much confusion plagues our ever-evolving foreign and defense policies. But today we stand back, sit quietly (in the cold, if you are on the National Mall) and appreciate this president and the country he and his office represent.Read Post | Comments (158)Mehmet Oz, M.D., 01/21/13Host, The Dr. Oz Show and Vice-Chair of Surgery at New York Presbyterian Hospital at ColumbiaMental illness can no longer be stigmatized as we hide our heads in the sand.

I don\u0027t understand why he needed to lie (and tweet) with such conviction that I believed in him. I understand why Manti Te\u0027o needed to build a great \"brand.\" I don\u0027t understand why he needed a fake social media girlfriend to do it.Read Post | Comments (17)Joe Peyronnin, 01/21/13Hofstra Journalism Professor\"As times change, so must we,\" President Barack Obama said in his eloquent and inspiring inaugural address. In many ways, President Obama\u0027s speech was a continuation of his campaign to engage women, gays, immigrants and the middle class.Read Post | CommentsMichael Roth, 01/21/13President, Wesleyan University\"The Last Supper\" seemed to many to be a miraculous work of art because its revolutionary combination of realism, dramatic power and attention to detail was unlike anything before. By casting light on the historical context of the work, King has enabled us to see the painting anew.Read Post | CommentsDavid Bromwich, 01/19/13Professor of Literature at YaleThe answers given by Bigelow and Boal to justify the normalizing of torture in Zero Dark Thirty have been vain, wheedling, and dodgy. They are a clever pair of filmmakers, without political or moral depth, but here, perhaps more than they realized, they were playing with fire.Read Post | Comments (702)Amb. Andrew J. Young, 01/21/13Chairman, WhyTuesday.orgMay God be with you Mr. President and Mrs. Obama as you continue to fulfill my dear friend Martin\u0027s dream, a dream he shared with two of the greatest presidents in history, a dream that must be made an enduring reality once and for all.Read Post | Comments (106)Michael Hogan, 01/20/13Executive Arts and Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post Media GroupIt was only last week that we saw Edith writhing in bed, wondering how on Earth she\u0027d survive without the slithering presence of Sir Anthony in her life, but here she is making herself useful, or at least trying to.Read Post | Comments (140)Grover Norquist, 01/21/13President, Americans for Tax ReformFrack Nation is not heavy handed, self-congratulatory, or \"full of itself.\" It breaks all the rules, or at least traditions, of the modern documentary. It has already changed the debate about our energy future for the better.Read Post | Comments (13)Dr. Mark Dybul, 01/21/13Executive Director, Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and MalariaEvery era offers something special. I think the most special thing about our current time is the incredible opportunity that scientific advances have provided in the field of global health, giving us the ability to completely control highly dangerous infectious diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.Read Post | Comments (55)Gary Hart, 01/20/13President, Hart International, Ltd.Until the government haters get specific, name the programs they want to get rid of, and find a majority of Americans who agree with them, things will remain pretty much the same.Read Post | Comments (343)Danielle Crittenden, 01/21/13International Blog Editor, Huffington PostIt was that kind of weekend -- for the permanent residents of the capital a combination of celebration and hassle. Flocks of circling helicopters thwack, thwack, thwacked overhead like noisy mechanical geese.

After all, many of his signature achievements derive not from successful bipartisanship but from having large and loyal Democratic majorities in both chambers in 2009-10.Read Post | Comments (14)Accion and Opportunity Fund, 01/21/13In communities throughout the U.S., there are 10.8 million stories of small business owners who are on the brink of success and primed to create jobs for themselves and others. Yet, they cannot access the loan that would put them over the edge.Read Post | CommentsArshad Hasan, 01/21/13Executive Director, Democracy for AmericaIn taking on health care reform Obama made a very clear statement that community is an American value. It is how he chooses to defend and expand Obamacare that will dictate whether he is remembered for his commitment to community or to the special interests of Washington.Read Post | Comments (23)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 01/19/13Author, research psychologist and gender scholarBoys in particular often look to sports heroes as role models, and it can be easy to see why: they excel in a way that most boys are familiar with and can understand. But it\u0027s key to encourage boys to look to other, perhaps less conventional role models for examples of how they might want to live and grow.Read Post | Comments (258)Rep. Ed Markey, 01/20/13U.S. Representative, 5th Congressional District of Massachusetts; Ranking Member, House Natural Resources CommitteeIn 1996 Republicans in Congress imposed a ban on federal funding to support research into the underlying causes and prevention of gun violence, which kills more than 30,000 Americans a year.Read Post | Comments (344)Jared Bernstein, 01/21/13Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorAs long as inequality is blocking opportunity, keeping working families from benefiting from the growth they themselves are helping to create, and violating the social contract and the basic American value that hard work should pay off, it\u0027s a huge freakin\u0027 problem.Read Post | Comments (185)Venture For America, 01/21/13Our culture of achievement has grown to emphasize visions of success that are, for the most part, fairly predictable.Read Post | CommentsAnn Brenoff, 01/20/13Senior Writer, The Huffington PostI told my daughter that 15-year-olds, like 63-year-olds, come in lots of different shapes and sizes.

Mary sees a swaggering demagogue while Arianna likes his trajectory.Read Post | CommentsJames Zogby, 01/19/13President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027No, our problem is neither that our guns are too sophisticated for our own good or that we don\u0027t have enough of them. Our problem is simpler and deeper. It is our \"gun culture\" and guns, period.Read Post | Comments (802)Lee Pelton, 01/20/13President, Emerson CollegeWho in America has not heard, read, or even memorized parts of the famous King speeches? These are powerful words. It is important, however, that we not be lulled by their familiarity into reducing King\u0027s life to bite-sized aphorisms. His legacy deserves more from us as thinking human beings.Read Post | CommentsCreate Jobs for USA, 01/21/13Today, nearly 12 million of our fellow Americans are unemployed.
