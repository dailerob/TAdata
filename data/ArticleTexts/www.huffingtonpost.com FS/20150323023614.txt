If anything, the right keeps gaining and the wealthy keep pulling away. How can this possibly be? In the face of all these assaults on the working and middle class, there are many movements but no Movement. The Occupy movement, which gave us the phrase, \"The One Percent,\" was too hung up on its own procedural purity to create a broad movement for economic justice.

The way he won his election has weakened Israel, destroyed its credibility and made it far less secure.Last person on Earth not on FacebookCritical thinking is NOT starting with the conclusion that you want to reach and then constructing a bridge of arguments specifically designed to get you there, and yet this is perilously close to the kind of thinking a standardized test requires.Teacher and writer; blogger, curmudgucation.blogspot.comDespite past voting obstacles, there are compelling reasons for blacks in Ferguson to rush to barricades this time to vote. One is the prospect of a regime change. Another is they could move to dump the racket that city officials have run for years that criminalizes virtually the city entire black population. Another is there\u0027s no excuse.Author and political analystAchieving affordable access to safe water and sanitation for all has been one of humanity\u0027s most intractable problems.
