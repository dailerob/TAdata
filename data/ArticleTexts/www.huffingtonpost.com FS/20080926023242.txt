{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOIf Barack Obama goes along with the latest bailout bill it in the name of post-partisan comity, he\u0027s making a big mistake. Washington is not lacking political leaders willing to go along with the flow. It\u0027s lacking political leaders willing to lead. \"This is our moment,\" Obama keeps saying in his speeches. And this is his moment to lead, rather than to appear as one of the Bailout Bipartisan Musketeers (\"One for all, and all for Goldman Sachs\"). Instead of siding with Bush and Paulson on far too many deal points, Obama should draw a line in the sand and refuse to cross it. Or has he surrounded himself with so many advisors who are looking at the bailout from a Wall Street perspective, he now sees it that way too?Read Post | CommentsBIOCarl Bernstein, 09.25.2008It is time to confront an awkward but profound question: whether in picking Palin as his running mate, McCain has committed -- by his own professed standards of duty and honor -- a singularly unpatriotic act.Read Post | Comments (238)BIONorman Lear, 09.25.2008It\u0027s a good bet that if Goldman Sachs makes it through, Mr. Buffett\u0027s involvement will prove to have been a smart one as well as a bailout. Why not call in Mr. Buffett as the people\u0027s representative?Read Post | Comments (66)BIOSeth Greenland, 09.25.2008Feel pretty good about calling off the old debate. Still got my surrogates firing away, still got the negative ads running in the swing states, and this old Airman\u0027s taking the high road!Read Post | CommentsBIOHooman Majd, 09.25.2008Iranians have in the last few weeks been as engrossed with the US presidential elections as Americans are, and hopeful that US policy towards Iran will be in for a change.Read Post | Comments (26)BIOBilly Kimball, 09.25.2008The other side made a good play (or ploy, if you insist.) Maybe McCain is lying about his motives for making the dramatic return to Capitol Hill but he isn\u0027t lying about any facts.Read Post | Comments (65)BIOMona Gable, 09.25.2008I\u0027m not the only female reporter who\u0027s irate about the treatment our Republican VP nominee has been suffering at the hands of boorish male politicians.Read Post | Comments (31)BIORicky Van Veen, 09.25.2008After hearing Matt Damon\u0027s brilliant comparison of a Palin presidency to a bad Disney movie, I said \"Let\u0027s make a trailer for what that movie would look like.\"Read Post | Comments (31)BIOEugene Jarecki, 09.25.2008I encourage McCain and, for that matter, anyone in Washington who\u0027s drunk the Gipper\u0027s free-market fundamentalist and gun-toting expansionist Kool-Aid, to spend a bit more time reading Eisenhower.Read Post | Comments (108)BIOMax and the Marginalized, 09.25.2008Our new song is about the financial crisis as the latest in a series of validations of progressive ideals that have unfortunately long-stopped being fun to get smug about.Read Post | CommentsBIODavid Bromwich, 09.25.2008The banking crisis, in the manner of its management, now looks like the October surprise one week early and with one week longer to turn it to advantage.Read Post | Comments (143)BIOBob Barr, 09.25.2008The bailout allows the Secretary of the Treasury to become an economic dictator, empowered to re-engineer the economy as he sees fit. These powers fit Kim Jong-il\u0027s North Korea, not the American republic.Read Post | Comments (17)BIODaniel Radosh, 09.25.2008The Iraq war has already cost taxpayers about $700 billion. If we hadn\u0027t gone to war, we could have gotten the bailout free and had some left over for a party.Read Post | CommentsPete Cenedella, 09.25.2008Louann Brizendine, M.D., 09.25.2008Joseph Romm, 09.25.2008Michael Shaw, 09.25.2008Bob Cesca, 09.24.2008Gavin Newsom, 09.24.2008Steven Weber, 09.24.2008Cenk Uygur, 09.24.2008Fortune\u0027s Stanley Bing, 09.25.2008Jon Soltz, 09.24.2008Steve Clemons, 09.24.2008Sean Carman, 09.25.2008Christine Pelosi, 09.24.2008Nico Pitney, 09.24.2008Daniel Levy, 09.25.2008Paul Abrams, 09.25.2008Nathaniel Frank, 09.25.2008Earl Ofari Hutchinson, 09.25.2008Dr. Tian Dayton, 09.25.2008David Sloan Wilson, 09.25.2008","h1":"Using a mobile device?
