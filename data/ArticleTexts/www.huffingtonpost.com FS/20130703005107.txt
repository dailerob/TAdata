{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOThose who don\u0027t pay much attention to Egypt would be forgiven for thinking that the images dominating their television sets these days are simply a replay of the popular revolution that overthrew President Mubarak two and a half years ago. They are not. What we are watching today is an attempt by a majority of normal Egyptians to reclaim a revolution that has stalled. They are out on the street in order to reset the conditions for success, and to place the country on a more promising and prosperous path. Make no mistake, these are messy, noisy, uncertain and unpredictable days for Egypt.CommentsDavid MednicoffDirector, Middle Eastern Studies, UMass-AmherstFollowing perhaps the largest national protest in global history, an enormous, diverse group of Egyptians awaits the political results of the rapid erosion of legitimacy of the government of Mohammed Morsi whom they elected very narrowly one year ago.Comments (21)Kirk DouglasActorI\u0027ve lived a long time. Almost 97 years. I\u0027ve seen a lot of fear-mongering, bigotry and discrimination. But now I\u0027m also seeing a modern generation of children who view the world very differently than their parents and grandparents.Comments (749)Alex ZhavoronkovDirector, Biogerontology Research FoundationThere are several megatrends and specific technology trends already in the making, and they will undoubtedly make us live significantly longer than our parents and grandparents.Comments (45)Amy EphronAuthorDear Edward Snowden, I\u0027m not sure what your end-game is or who appointed you to be a one-man band.CommentsAbdelhadi FarajPrisoner number 329 at Guantanamo BayThis is my call to the outside world from behind these rusty bars, in this monstrous cell. The past few months have been among the harshest lived by the prisoners here. Does the world know what is happening in this prison?Comments (73)Linda RobertsonLeader, Local HIV/AIDS Outreach Team, Overlake Christian Church, Redmond, Was.; CareTeam member and volunteer, RoseHedge MultiFaith Works, Seattle, Wash.We told our son that he had to choose between Jesus and his sexuality. Choosing God, practically, meant living a lifetime condemned to being alone. So, just before his 18th birthday, Ryan, depressed, suicidal and disillusioned, made a new choice.Comments (1,969)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027The European speculation tax will lead to a more efficient and stable financial sector, more revenue for governments, and less inequality. And the only losers are the big rollers in the financial industry. Naturally Wall Street would do everything in its power to stop the spread of such taxes.Comments (205)Sarah KayFounder, Project V.O.I.C.E.Women don\u0027t have to be defined by others. We have the power to define ourselves: by telling our own stories, in our own words, with our own voices.CommentsRobert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Supreme Court justices are appointed for life in order to ensure their independence from politics. But when it comes to the core political strategy of the Republican Party, the five Republican appointees are, in effect, an extension of the GOP.Comments (1,560)Rep. Charles RangelRepresentative from the 13th Congressional District in New YorkMake no mistake: voting rights in this country are still under assault. In the 1960s, voter suppression was carried out with attack dogs, water hoses, and physical beatings Today, those who seek to disenfranchise minorities use more discreet tactics.CommentsAmitai EtzioniProfessor of international relations, George Washington UniversityAlthough Air-Sea Battle is often criticized as being a plan without a strategy, it actually reflects a major strategic shift, namely, to defeat China rather than accommodate its rise as a regional power. Air-Sea Battle goes way beyond the containment strategy employed against the USSR.Comments (80)Vivian Diller, Ph.D.Psychologist and author, \u0027Face It\u0027The \u0027midlife crisis\u0027 has served as fodder for many a Judd Apatow movie, but the reality of the experience is anything but funny.CommentsConnie PillichMember of the Ohio House of RepresentativesSome politicians in Ohio have explicitly said their goal is to make our state more like Texas. So there\u0027s a great irony that, just as one brave woman in Austin was standing up to protect reproductive health choices for women, men here in Columbus were plotting ways to take them away.CommentsMuqtedar KhanAssociate Professor of Islam and Global Affairs, the University of DelawareSecularists in both Cairo and Istanbul are afraid that their governments are pandering to right wing Islamic extremist ideas to advance an Islamic project that will curtail individual freedoms. They protest because they feel democracy is undermining freedom.Comments (13)Scott BlakemanPolitical comedianAndrew Pochter is the 21-year-old Kenyon College student who was stabbed to death during a violent demonstration in Alexandria, Egypt on Friday.CommentsRobert RedfordActor, director and environmental activistWithout question, we\u0027re facing a climate crisis. And it is taxpayers who are bearing the high costs.Comments (308)Travel + LeisureTravelandLeisure.comTo determine which city has the biggest nose in the air, we factored in some traditional staples of snobbery: a reputation for aloof and smarty-pants residents, along with high-end shopping and highbrow cultural offerings like classical music and theater.Comments (1,082)Joseph A. PalermoProfessor, historian, authorRonald Reagan did the nation a lasting disservice by bringing into our politics in a huge way the Jerry Falwells and Pat Robertsons of this world. Thirty years later this Reagan coalition is still going strong.Comments (27)Hulu.comWatchers of Good TVThen there\u0027s \"poor old\" Edith who loses her cousin-boyfriend on the Titanic in episode one. It\u0027s all downhill at Downton from there. She follows men around like a puppy, only to get rejected. Dumped by a burn victim, ditched at the alter, and crushing on a married man, Edith is sad sack.CommentsJacqueline BhabhaDirector of Research, François-Xavier Bagnoud Center for Health and Human Rights, Harvard UniversityWithout access to education, impoverished young women from patriarchal backgrounds are destined to be passive spectators to rapid economic development while their better educated peers benefit from rapidly expanding opportunities.CommentsMatthew DeBordWrites on economics, infotainment, finance, and cars.Due to smartphones and the envelope-pushing of technologies such as Google Glass, we\u0027ve been collectively indoctrinated into an omnipresent cult of irresistible consumer Web evolution.CommentsMichael P. McDonaldAssociate Professor, George Mason UniversityRepublicans are at it again, making it harder to vote. It is no coincidence that these major voting changes are being considered a week after the Supreme Court struck down the coverage formula in Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act.CommentsMike RyanSenior Entertainment Writer, The Huffington PostFor the life of me, I just can\u0027t figure out whom this movie is for, which is why I find it so fascinating. Before I saw the movie, I just assumed it would be for kids. It is not for kids. (At my screening, I witnessed wary adults lead a mass exodus of children after the villain slices out the heart of a still living human being, then takes a bite.)Comments (672)P.G. SittenfeldCincinnati City CouncilmanAnd the hopes for a Republican revival in 2016 rest upon... ? The answer to that question, according to a featured article that Politico ran at the end of last week, just might be Ohio Governor John Kasich.Comments (100)Ann BrenoffSenior Writer, The Huffington PostWe had left California and wound up in the state of Relaxation, a place that we hadn\u0027t visited in a very long time, like maybe never.CommentsRobert ScheerEditor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027Was Snowden a \"traitor,\" as both California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein and former Vice President Dick Cheney have insisted, or a genuine whistleblower, as some of our allies are beginning to grasp for letting folks around the world in on the dirty secrets of U.S. intelligence?Comments (193)Father Jim O\u0027Shea, C.P.Passionist Roman Catholic priestPaula Deen is an easy target. Temporarily destroying her career is a soothing balm for a national soul tortured by what to do about the current scourge of racism and inequality that is not a remnant of the past but a policy of the present.Comments (598)Drew Ramsey, M.D.Assistant Clinical Professor of Psychiatry, Columbia University and New York State Psychiatric InstituteMy ultimate measure of a food is its power to support brain health, and it is clear that more kale in your diet means a happier, healthier, sexier you -- all the basic signs that your brain is running well.Comments (102)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesThe marriage equality movement has been a success for a lot of reasons. One of them, no doubt, is branding and framing. And it\u0027s time to learn from that and apply it to other battles, like the battle against employment discrimination, which has been a dismal failure.Comments (29)Renee JainLeading childhood happiness and resilience expertMother Nature would rather have us perceive something as more dangerous than it is so we react promptly. Rationally dissecting every instance in which we feel threatened isn\u0027t always realistic, but it is possible to neutralize this cognitive distortion.Comments (21)Hulu.com, 2013. 2.07VisualNews.com, 2013. 2.07Mark Steber, 2013. 2.07Mohamed A.
