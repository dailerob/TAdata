{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jason LinkinsEditor, Eat the PressLast night, the exemplar of politesse that is the Anthony Weiner mayoral campaign took a turn that we should have perhaps expected, when his communications director, Barbara Morgan, blasted one-time Weiner intern-turned-scoop purveyor Olivia Nuzzi with a litany of eye-popping obscenities. Morgan made these remarks to TPM reporter Hunter Walker, after Nuzzi\u0027s insider-look at the Weiner campaign made the cover of the New York Daily News. As often is the case when a string of newsmaking vulgarities come stumbling into our lives, newspapers covering the story were faced with the challenge of presenting the remarks to their readerships of ostensible adults. Some of the terms deployed by Morgan were words whose usage in print have long been governed by the vagaries of internal style guides. But Morgan, momentarily confusing the person under whom she works with a person she supervised, also referred to Nuzzi as a \"slutbag.\"Comments (144)Robert ScheerEditor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027The idea that Barack Obama would still consider appointing Lawrence Summers to head the Federal Reserve rather than order an investigation into this former White House official\u0027s Wall Street payments mocks the president\u0027s claimed concern for the disappearing middle class.Comments (142)Social SmurfSocial Media Blogger, SmurfEveryone\u0027s got favorite users they follow on Facebook, Instgram, and Twitter!

That\u0027s the bad news. The good news is he was found not guilty on the charge of \"aiding the enemy.\" That\u0027s \u0027cause who he was aiding was us, the American people. And we\u0027re not the enemy.

No miracles will be needed this season. \"SNL\" is in good shape -- great shape, even.

GoodmanExecutive Business Editor, The Huffington PostThe president visited an Amazon warehouse on the city\u0027s industrial periphery to spotlight a hopeful surge in recent hiring, part of his campaign to urge job creation as the fix for middle class decline.

Why shouldn\u0027t all ladies want a man who will just listen and go shopping but isn\u0027t a total betch like their girlfriends are can be? The thing is that grouping all gay men into this \"gay best friend\" bundle counts as stereotyping.CommentsBernard-Henri LévyFrench philosopher and writerWhat about the plan for a moderate Islamist government, the idea of an Islamist succession that would not become just another form of despotism? Whatever happens next in Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood has buried that idea.Comments (77)Sonal ShahSenior Fellow, Case FoundationAs I sit here at this gathering, I see that we each in our own ways are doing BIG things to move small mountains. Yet, I can\u0027t seem to get over the nagging feeling that there must be more. Sure we can have 1000 successes, but is that enough? Will each of these individual efforts be enough to create the tipping point?CommentsRichard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureSure, they still need scapegoats they can indict instead of Wall Street executives.
