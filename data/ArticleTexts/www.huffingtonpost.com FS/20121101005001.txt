{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Writer and FilmmakerSometimes, in the heat of an election, it is easy for voters to forget about the bigger picture. With three debates, endless soundbites, and, if you live in a swing state, a ceaseless barrage of television ads, it is hard for some to remember the context and history of the candidates\u0027 claims. It is this hectic environment that allows Mitt Romney to, suddenly, turn his back on two years of campaigning (all caught on video) on far-right positions and shake the Etch-A-Sketch and call himself a moderate. But sometimes, an event happens that shakes the electorate up and forces it to concentrate on who the candidates really are and what they stand for. It happened when the financial crisis hit in September 2008, and it is happening again in 2012 with Hurricane Sandy.Read Post | Comments (486)Cheryl Saban Ph.D., 10/31/12Author and advocate for women and childrenI observed the best in people during this storm. And now, as I look up at the sky, and see the clouds parting, and patches of blue sky, I am grateful I was here to witness this.Read Post | Comments (12)Robert Creamer, 10/30/12Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersNatural disasters make people remember why it is so important that we have a society where we have each other\u0027s back. They make us remember that government is the name we give to the things we choose to do together.Read Post | Comments (706)Arianna Huffington, 10/30/12The collective effort, the we\u0027re-all-in-this-together spirit, has been great to see after Sandy. But it shouldn\u0027t take a natural disaster to make us tap into our natural humanity.Read Post | Comments (264)Errol Morris, 10/31/12Award-Winning filmmakerIn the 2008 presidential election, roughly half of eligible voters from age 18 to 24 voted. An even smaller share of young voters is expected in 2012. I wanted to find out why. So I called more than 50 people under the age of 40 into a studio, and asked them.Read Post | Comments (231)Michael Moore, 10/31/12Oscar and Emmy-winning directorI have a personal favor I\u0027d like to ask each of you.

Granholm, 10/30/12Former governor of Michigan; Host, \u0027The War Room\u0027 on Current TV; columnist, Politico; faculty member, UC BerkeleyMitt Romney must realize that he has lost the industrial Midwest because he\u0027s completely lost a grip on reality. He\u0027s decided to throw a Hail Mary pass that will cause his already-struggling campaign to implode in Ohio.Read Post | Comments (616)Ari Melber, 10/31/12Attorney \u0026 Correspondent for The Nation magazineAn attack without an alternative isn\u0027t policy -- it\u0027s commentary. And no one can seriously argue that our firefighters and first responders will do a better job if we cut their funding, as congressional Republicans have proposed.Read Post | Comments (30)Peter H. Gleick, 10/31/12President, Pacific InstituteWe may disagree among ourselves about matters of values, opinion, and policy, but we and our elected representatives must not misuse, hide, or misrepresent science and fact in service of our political wars.Read Post | Comments (24)Alexandra Gross, 10/31/12Investigative Researcher, National Registry of ExonerationsI don\u0027t remember the first letter I got from Paris.

El-Erian, 10/30/12CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOIf history is a guide, and notwithstanding the significant devastation created by Hurricane Sandy, there should be limited expectation that even this stark situation will prompt Congress to take concerted and meaningful action.Read Post | Comments (12)Peter McGraw and Joel Warner, 10/31/12The Humor CodeHowever you slice and dice the presidential candidates\u0027 performances at the three debates, there\u0027s little question that Barack Obama won on the comedy front.Read Post | Comments (18)Richard (RJ) Eskow, 10/31/12Writer; host, \u0027The Breakdown\u0027; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureHurricane Sandy was the stimulus nobody wanted. It took a terrible toll in lives, homes, and dreams. For the families who lost loved ones the tragedy will never end. And yet, in a bitter irony, this terrible storm will spur the kind of spending we should have been seeing all along.Read Post | Comments (74)Adam Levin, 10/31/12Founder, Credit.com and former director NJ Division of Consumer AffairsOn both the financial catastrophe and the storm, Governor Romney got it completely wrong.

Nobody really wants to talk about it, but it is as critical as it is constructive that we have that conversation now.Read Post | Comments (16)Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, 10/31/12Rabbi and WriterWhat was G-d thinking when he sent Hurricane Sandy and what could have been its purpose? In truth, I don\u0027t much care, because our role as humans is not to understand G-d\u0027s plan in the face of horror and tragedy, but to challenge God and demand that human life always be protected and preserved.Read Post | Comments (151)Harvey Karp, 10/31/12Pediatrician.
