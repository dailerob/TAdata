{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027On Monday the Supreme Court struck down a key part of the Affordable Care Act, ruling that privately-owned corporations don\u0027t have to offer their employees contraceptive coverage that conflicts with the corporate owners\u0027 religious beliefs. The owners of Hobby Lobby, the plaintiffs in the case, were always free to practice their religion. The Court bestowed religious freedom on their corporation as well -- a leap of logic as absurd as giving corporations freedom of speech. Corporations aren\u0027t people. The deeper problem is the Court\u0027s obliviousness to the growing imbalance of economic power between corporations and real people. By giving companies the right to not offer employees contraceptive services otherwise mandated by law, the Court ignored the rights of employees to receive those services.The days when Big Business can have it both ways -- as an artificial, power-concentrating entity with special privileges and immunities, on the one hand, and all the constitutional human rights of real people on the other hand, are coming to an end.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorCommon Core testing will turn out to be the money pit that consumed American education. The sooner it dies, the sooner schools and teachers will be freed of the Giant Federal Accountability Plan hatched in secret and foisted upon our nation\u0027s schools.Research Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027On this July 4 we should dedicate ourselves to recovering the American promise that education should increase our independence. Gearing education only to meeting current economic conditions is a ticket to conformity -- and also to economic and cultural mediocrity.President, Wesleyan UniversityThe 2-degree limit is the last guardrail for a safe global climate. If temperatures shoot beyond 2 degrees, it\u0027s quite possible that natural feedbacks -- melting ice sheets, drying rainforests, release of greenhouse gases from the melting tundra -- could carry the world to runaway climate change.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \"To Move the World: JFK\u0027s Quest for Peace\"What we discovered is that people feel better and perform better and more sustainably when four basic needs are met: renewal (physical); value (emotional), focus (mental) and purpose (spiritual).President of The Energy Project; Author of Be Excellent at Anything: The Four Keys to Transforming the Way We Work and LiveBringing a Glock into Starbucks doesn\u0027t make you a freedom fighter. If you want to carry a weapon and wear tactical clothing, here\u0027s an idea: Go see a recruiter.Novelist, journalist, Iraq and Afghanistan veteran, retired Air National Guard senior master sergeantShould we -- teachers, that is -- be fighting to maintain job protections for our colleagues whose incompetence is at best negligent and at worst abusive? How about we concede a baseline of quality in each classroom?Veteran high school teacher and basketball coach, author of Students First and Other LiesThe notion that public space is safer if people don\u0027t walk around with guns seems to be spreading -- and it\u0027s interesting that the NRA\u0027s response so far to Target\u0027s new policy has been no response at all.Mike the Gun GuySince corporations are people now, I thought this corporation deserved a human breakup letter. Here it goes.Writer, Netflix enthusiast and pug momThe 4th of July might commemorate the independence of our country -- but it also serves as a bitter reminder that in 1776, the country that I love had no place for me in it.Sr. Editor for Special Projects, The Huffington PostThe ultimate folly is the belief that people are infinitely malleable, that Americans have been anointed to shape and mold humanity against its will, and that there is nothing which cannot be achieved through a few bombing runs, an occasional invasion, and a thorough military occupation.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteThis month California is celebrating the 10th anniversary of its first-in-the-nation Paid Family Leave (PFL) program, which has helped more than 1.5 million parents. But despite the track record, too few parents are taking advantage of the program, and those parents who may need it most are least likely to sign up.Award-winning journalist, bestselling author and activistBowe Bergdahl is far from unique. Wars of choice are an awfully hard sell, particularly when a naïve young soldier finds that instead of defending freedom he is actually punishing local people for reasons that neither he nor the natives can comprehend.Listener bias results in most people thinking that women are hogging the floor when men are actually dominating.Feminist, Writer, Satirist... not always in that orderAs we ready ourselves to enjoy the colorful symbolism in the evening skies of Independence Day celebrations across the nation, it\u0027s crucial that you not allow a little something like document shredding stand between you and the truth.Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911Everything about our wedding was perfect to me. It was a beautiful, magical day -- and I never, ever, ever want to do it again.Lifestyle Blog Editor, The Huffington PostJudge Ginsburg certainly got it right when she said that the Supreme Court\u0027s Hobby Lobby decision is going to create \"havoc.\" And as the repercussions mount, so do the questions, in areas that range from economics and taxation to theology and philosophy.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourRace and ethnicity are important but largely unacknowledged aspects of the immigration debates in France. The term \"immigrant\" has become a shorthand reference to ethnic minorities who are harshly criticized for failing to embrace French values and traditions.Professor of LawLaughing was the moral equivalent of mocking someone for their stutter. Or telling a gay kid that he should never find love because you find that kind of sex icky. Or cheering on the police as they take a homeless veteran\u0027s shopping cart away, because you just want them to disappear. It. Was. Punching. Down.Director of Advocacy, SPART*AMost commitments in life come with an escape clause. You can join a group and later decide to leave. You can accept a job and then quit. Deep friendships can slowly fade -- even marriages. But to be asked by someone to participate in the act of creating a child... this was truly sacred.Artist, activist, community organizer, writer and Creative Director, PigeonHat IndustriesFor the first time in history, we face the possibility of destroying the prospects for decent existence -- and not in the distant future. For this reason alone, it is imperative to sweep away the ideological clouds and face honestly and realistically the question of how policy decisions are made, and what we can do to alter them before it is too late.Institute Professor emeritus, MIT Department of Linguistics and PhilosophyMichael Patrick MacDonald is a storyteller. Michael recently encouraged the crowd of young leaders at the Children\u0027s Defense Fund Freedom Schools\u0027 National Training to understand the power of storytelling to create change.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundFree the body, mind and spirit with these simple yoga poses! Below explore some tried and true yoga poses with a little different spin for extra opening, release, and freedom!Co-Founder \u0026 CEO, Health Yoga Life, www.healthyogalife.comA hundred years ago, child birth was risky and infant mortality rates were horrific. How would you feel if 30 percent of infants died? Or if 900 expectant mothers out of every 100,000 died giving birth? But thanks to technology, the reality today is far different.Chairman/CEO, XPRIZEComing from someone who spent the better part of my 21 years trying to be someone I wasn\u0027t, I can without a doubt say that the day I stopped caring was the day that everything began to fall into place. Here are the beautiful things that happen when you stop apologizing for who you are.Writer of the blog, Champagne \u0026 Sass; Senior at Ole MissThese three young men were killed by hateful people who had no regard for humanity or the values of life treasured by most. Until the world truly understands this evil and acts to combat it, cultures of hate like those responsible for taking the lives of Naftali, Eyal and Gilad will sadly continue to flourish.National Director, Anti-Defamation LeagueLike the NBA\u0027s San Antonio Spurs revealed in the NBA finals, diversity in sports represents the welcome face of globalization. For World Cup fans, that diversity has been nowhere greater than in the composition of the Latin American teams.Professor of Sociology at Princeton UniversityLast week, at the invitation of my friend Muhammad Yunus, I traveled to Bangladesh, a truly humbling and inspiring experience. I met so many incredible people struggling to improve their country and their lives.President, Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human RightsThe fact that there\u0027s finally a rom-com about abortion is wonderful. \"Obvious Child\", starring comedian Jenny Slate, depicts a world where an abortion is more like a trip to the dentist than a life-ruiner. For many upper-middle class women such as me, the undramatic portrayal is a welcome reality. Our lives are much improved since motherhood has morphed from a straitjacket into a spandex that accommodates 21st-century ambitions. But not all groups of women have benefited from more flexible notions of maternity.Blogs Editor, Huffington Post CanadaWhen the George W. Bush administration commenced its global sales pitch to invade Iraq in 2002, misplaced fear and overly rosy projections for its success helped make it happen. If only they had heeded the prescient warnings of these nine individuals.Canadian writer and bloggerGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"WOW DOW: 17,000+",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
