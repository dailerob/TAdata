{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week saw the first conservative government reelected to a second term in the U.K. since Margaret Thatcher\u0027s. Returns showed David Cameron winning easily, with Labour and the Liberal Democrats losing big. But the other clear losers were the pollsters, along with anyone who believed their predictions of a virtual tie. Pollsters are not exactly on a roll. In March, polls wrongly showed a dead-heat in Israel between the Zionist Union party and Benjamin Netanyahu\u0027s Likud, which, in fact, won handily. And here at home, polls in the 2014 midterms overestimated Democrats in Senate races by four percent. As three new candidates -- Mike Huckabee, Carly Fiorina and Ben Carson -- tossed their hats into the crowded presidential ring this week, it\u0027s a good time to remind ourselves about the folly of breathless poll-obsessed political coverage. It\u0027s the people, not the polls, that matter. And focusing on the horse race at the expense of debating real issues makes losers of us all.In the next 10 years, we believe that computers will move beyond their current role as our assistants, and become our advisors. With their help, we\u0027ll grapple with and solve some of the toughest issues facing the world today.Executive chairman of GoogleDirector of Google Ideas \u0026 Advisor to the Executive Chairman of GoogleI want my children, Max and Summer, to always appreciate what they have, but also to understand they have a role in helping our fellow citizens around the world to the basic need of food. I\u0027d love for them to stumble upon this article and other hunger relief stories a decade from now and see that there is an end to world hunger.Performer, mom and global hunger relief advocateIt\u0027s been 10 years since The Huffington Post was born, on May 9, 2005. We\u0027ve done a lot of reminiscing during our anniversary week, but our real focus is on looking ahead. That\u0027s why the theme for our 10-year anniversary is \"The Next 10.\" To celebrate this milestone, we\u0027re rolling out a range of special projects, launches and events -- the high and the low, the serious and the playful -- and all of them have something to say about where we\u0027re coming from and especially where we\u0027re going. I\u0027m grateful to everyone who has been a part of HuffPost from Day 1. And I\u0027m especially grateful to everyone who has read, viewed and shared what we\u0027re doing on HuffPost. We are here because of you.In the next 10 years, the middle class\u0027s share of the total economic pie will continue to shrink, while the share going to the very top will continue to grow. But the current trend is not preordained to last, and only the most rigid technological determinist would assume this to be our inevitable fate.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027I don\u0027t know enough to understand what that must be like for a parent or what it means to be a parent, for that matter. But I do know what it\u0027s like to be loved, because my mother showed me what that meant, even when she should have been out of love herself.Comedian, Host, ‘Chelsea Lately’The next decade is decisive because trajectory counts for so much; if we bend it now, we may slide the car to a halt with just the front tires hanging off the cliff. But if we sail on for a few more years, it\u0027s pretty clear we\u0027re fast and furiously going airborne -- that\u0027s what happens when, say, Arctic permafrost starts to melt in earnest, releasing clouds of methane.Author of a dozen books, including \u0027The End of Nature\u0027 and \u0027Deep Economy\u0027How about we pause, put down our devices, look up and listen to our hearts and our consciences? Not so much \u0027connectivity\u0027 as just connecting with each other. And if that moral progress could keep pace with technological progress then that would be, well, real progress.Hashemite Kingdom of JordanIt\u0027s unnerving how teams can make business and sport decisions on your body while you\u0027re not given the same grace to make the best choices for your own career. Maybe in 10 years the business of football will be equally regarded on all sides.6-year NFL veteran, screenwriter, creatorAs one of Dave Goldberg\u0027s friends put it, \"Don\u0027t go back to life as it was. Pack more loving and more giving into it as Dave did and don\u0027t sweat the small stuff.\" And that is the truth we are left with at the end of this heartbreaking, yet soul-stirring day.The media of the future is nimble, fit, and intimate. It has no respect for its elders. It doesn\u0027t care how it was done before. There is a very real power in realizing this. Those who cling on to power are most likely to lose it.Founder and owner, TheBlazeWall Street cannot be an island unto itself and we need to break up those largest banks to put the focus back on working class Americans.Independent U.S. Senator from VermontEmilie\u0027s birth and Mother\u0027s Day are emotionally so connected for me. They are one and the same. I was truly blessed to have been given such a sweet angel, and since her death at Sandy Hook, I have missed her every moment of every day.Blogger, TheParkerFive and co-founder, safeandsoundschools.org and The Emilie Parker Art ConnectionIn this era of truce, the US and Iran can dialogue about regional problems rather than seeing the absence of diplomacy exacerbate existing conflicts. Yet, in spite of this pending historic achievement, dark years await the Middle East.President, National Iranian American CouncilNEW YORK -- A decade from now, the hearts of some of our largest cities will no longer be defined by gleaming skyscrapers surrounded by well-manicured corporate plazas. The city will regain its human scale and emerge once again as a series of communities -- completing a fascinating journey back to the future.Milstein Professor of Urban Development, Columbia UniversityCEOs and other business leaders have to stand up for all of their stakeholders -- employees, customers, partners, shareholders and local communities -- and recognize that they are part of a larger ecosystem. Issues ranging from climate change and global health to food production and education impact every business.Chairman and CEO of SalesforceIf prevention were a national priority, how would our lives change? That question is followed by another one, which is: What will happen 10 years from now in terms of the health of Americans? Will the year 2025 find Americans stronger, healthier and living longer?Board-certified radiologist; Board member, Lesscancer; Author, \u0027A World Without Cancer\u0027Technology affords us a new hope. With the advent of the iPhone we\u0027re in a national state of shock regarding the incredibly destructive \"shoot first\" culture of many police departments. This shock could lead to major reform that could uplift and save so many lives.Writer-Director, How To Make Money Selling DrugsProducer, How To Make Money Selling DrugsAll editors, unburdened of the Sisyphean task of maintaining newsstand sales, could try more interesting, less available people -- a commodity as scarce as actual covers themselves.Chief creative officer, co-president of Entertainment Group, Guggenheim MediaWhere you work is no longer the major source of meaning. And in the next decade, employers will fade even further into the background.Wharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027The question before the court of appeals was whether the collection of this enormous database is \"relevant\" to an \"authorized investigation.\" The problem is that the word \"relevant\" is ambiguous. In the section 215 telephone metadata program, however, the massive amount of information collected is not, at the time it is collected, \"relevant\" to any particular suspected terrorist or suspected terrorist plot.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoWe need to move beyond the \"flags and footprints\" missions and travel to space with the intent to stay, and Mars is our best bet. The good news is that the majority of the obstacles are economic, rather than engineering. The bad news is that it\u0027s a tough business case to close.Business Development Specialist for Masten Space Systems, Media Specialist for the Commercial Spaceflight FederationIn 2025, in accordance with Moore\u0027s law, we will see an acceleration in the rate of change as we move closer to a world of true abundance. Here are eight areas where we\u0027ll see extraordinary transformation in the next decade.Chairman/CEO, XPRIZEIt\u0027s hard for me to celebrate on Mother\u0027s Day. I feel the absence of my 23-year-old son, Sean Elijah Bell, who was killed on November 25, 2006. He was out celebrating at his own bachelor party with his friends in New York City. It was only a matter of a hours before his wedding, and I was so thrilled.Founder, Mothers of Never AgainI firmly believe that without Lisa, the negative education statistics that plague Latino communities would have become my sobering reality. Instead, Lisa was one of the first people who recognized my potential and instilled in me a passion for learning.Associate Editor to Arianna HuffingtonThe state of race, culture and religion in America is a key metric for how we are evolving as a society. The question for the church in 2025 is do we have enough elasticity and self-awareness to accommodate other customs, and views different from our own?Senior Pastor, Potter\u0027s House, TexasThis dark vision for the future will be our own fault if we allow the attack on journalism around the world to go unchecked for another decade, if we continue to look the other way and ignore how killing the messenger erodes democracy and threatens a free, open society.Founder and Executive Director of The GroundTruth Project, Co-founder of GlobalPostTop talent -- at all levels -- remains the scarcest resource in corporate America. Over the next 10 years, we will see leaders invest far more thought and effort into developing their human capital.Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of AetnaOf the many things that have touched me about the response to my memoir Wild, the fact that so many people who\u0027ve had and survived lung cancer or loved someone who died of the disease see themselves in my story is among the most meaningful.Author, \"Wild\"I remain optimistic that one day we will see a world where leaders look beyond the next electoral cycle or the next shareholder meeting. Where we collectively realize that we do not live in a zero-sum world where someone\u0027s gain automatically comes at another\u0027s expense.Chair of the Kofi Annan Foundation and The EldersYes, this isn\u0027t easy, since a fake news outlet could claim to be trustworthy.
