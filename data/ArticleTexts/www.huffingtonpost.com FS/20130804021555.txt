{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundEvery gun in our country should be childproof. One-third of all households with children have at least one gun in the home, and it’s estimated that nearly two million children live in homes with an unlocked and loaded gun. But federal law is silent on gun-related consumer safety standards and child access prevention, and for nearly 40 years the CPSC’s hands have been tied even as potentially lifesaving technology has been innovated. As a result, many handguns don’t contain easily installed life-saving safety features. Many gun tragedies could have been prevented by the use of simple technologies that exist today. Authorized-user identification, or personalized, gun technology encompasses a broad range of manufacturing designs that allow guns to recognize an authorized user and become inoperable when handled by anyone else.Comments (405)Dan DennettCognitive scientist and philosopherIt is a mistake to think that first there was sweetness, sexiness, and cuteness, and then we evolved to love these properties. That\u0027s just about backwardsComments (388)Elizabeth LicorishFreelance Writer and AuthorAt Lululemon, everything about you is inventoried and measured in terms of \"authenticity\" and \"integrity.\" Which sounds reasonable, until you realize your yoga mat\u0027s on a sweaty, slippery slope. In fact, according to Lululemon\u0027s standards, almost everyone is a lazy, sociopathic scumbag.Comments (499)Carla BuzasiCarla Buzasi is editor-in-chief of The Huffington Post UKOn Tuesday evening at Bafta in London, nearly 300 women - and a \u0027few good men\u0027 - gathered to discuss how we redefine success in the 21st Century.CommentsDavid BromwichProfessor of Literature, Yale UniversityThe contemporary notion of a \"trade-off\" between liberty and security assumes that life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are separable goods. They are separate in our experience, so the argument runs, and therefore they must be separate in our political calculations.Comments (364)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarWhile there\u0027s no longer a question of whether a woman can succeed in \"a man\u0027s world,\" statistics indicate that either the glass ceiling is thicker and lower than we imagined, or that younger women on the way up are finding a way out. Or, quite possibly, both.Comments (180)Ram DassSpiritual teacher and best-selling authorWorking with the dying is like being a midwife for this great rite of passage of death.Comments (102)Mark GongloffChief financial writer, The Huffington PostIn answer to the question, \"Why on earth should Larry Summers be chairman of the Federal Reserve?\" his supporters usually allege that he is great in a crisis. Whether you believe that depends on your definition of \"great.\" In fact, there is plenty of evidence that Larry Summers is actually kind of terrible in a crisis.Comments (126)Joy GabrielWriter and momIs my body supposed to pretend it didn\u0027t rearrange all my organs and open my rib cage and my hips and grow a new human person and then proceed to feed and nourish that person from the very same body that delivered him, whole and perfect, into the world?Comments (189)Andrew ZimbalistRobert A. Woods Professor of Economics, Smith CollegeAlthough it is a favorite pastime among sportswriters to pick sides and make black-and-white arguments, it is sensible here to recognize that the issue of controlling artificial stimulants is and will continue to be enormously complex.Comments (12)Saul Landau and Philip BrennerAs dozens of Guantánamo detainees continue their hunger strike, and a ruling about force-feeding them remains in limbo between different federal courts, the moment is ripe for President Obama to act with courage and decisiveness.CommentsTrita ParsiPresident, National Iranian American CouncilThe Ahmadinejad era has officially come to an end. Rest assure, few in Iran are mourning this occasion. But questions still remain as to whether the new President, Hassan Rouhani can usher in a new era. Here are a few thoughts on the subject.Comments (19)Russell SimmonsFounder, GlobalGrind.comThe lucky ones, like you and me, owe a real explanation of the problems in our community to the ones who are still living in struggle, not some old, conservative talking points left in the garbage from Mitt Romney\u0027s campaign.Comments (651)Kim SimonMother, Wife, Blogger, mamabythebay.comI am a formula mom. I am a breastfeeding mom. I know what it feels like when your breasts \"let-down,\" and I know what it feels like when your heart \"lets-down.\" The beauty of our stories is that we are all feeding with love.Comments (200)Jordan K. TurgeonLifestyle Blog Editor, The Huffington PostFor me, health means strength. Health means trying each day to treat my body well. That kind of health goes beyond just diet and exercise. It comes in a variety of sizes. And if you don\u0027t carry that size in your store, I\u0027m happy to take my money elsewhere.Comments (69)Doug BandowSenior Fellow, the Cato InstituteWashington\u0027s best hope is to disengage, leaving Egyptians to decide their own future. The administration should simply point to the law. A coup has occurred and the democratic process has been overthrown by the military, so aid must be halted.Comments (252)Dr Raj Persaud and Adrian FurnhamWhat\u0027s chic, what\u0027s in and what\u0027s out, should be predicted by evolutionary theory. Otherwise it will be judged by history as just a passing phase. Eventually as outmoded as shoulder pads from the 1980s.Comments (150)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorAll told, today\u0027s jobs report is quite consistent with both recent job reports and the underlying pace of real GDP growth. We\u0027re growing, but at a pace that is only very slowly absorbing the slack that remains in the job market even as we\u0027re four years into the expansion that began in the second quarter of 2009.Comments (173)Sarah Koppelkamhopeave.wordpress.comHow to talk to your daughter about her body, step one: Don\u0027t talk to your daughter about her body, except to teach her how it works. Don\u0027t say anything if she\u0027s lost weight. Don\u0027t say anything if she\u0027s gained weight. Here are some things you can say instead.Comments (668)James ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027There are plenty of reasons to be cynical about U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry\u0027s relaunch of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. The personalities and the politics involved do not immediately inspire confidence. Nevertheless, I choose not to be negative.Comments (122)Bob BurnettBerkeley writer, retired Silicon Valley executiveIt would seem that Republicans would want to adopt strategies that would strengthen their appeal to women -- particularly young women, a group they lost overwhelmingly. But instead they\u0027ve pursued their war on abortion rights with undiminished vigor.Comments (551)Matthew HurleyTheoretical cognitive scientistHow does innately liking sweetness translate into thinking about and seeking out the dessert menu, when there is no ongoing experience of sweetness right there on our tongues to inform us of our enjoyment?CommentsJim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027The battles over immigration reform and race have weighed heavily on me this summer. They have each become a symbol and a test, for me, of whether we can resurrect \"the common good\" in this nation.Comments (45)Paul SzepTwo-time Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonistComments (187)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorMitt Romney famously said during his most recent bid for the presidency: \"Corporations are people, my friend.\" Perhaps nothing else better surmises the state of our country than a prominent politician running for the presidency openly advancing such a flawed opinion.Comments (137)Kiki Von GlinowSenior Editor, HuffPost CelebrityWhile it may not be entirely legal for Americans to travel to Cuba, the \"green crocodile with eyes of stone and water\" (as Cuban poet Nicolás Guillén calls the island) could make the non-traditional customs experience a tempting one.Comments (79)Adam GrantWharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027The jury is still out on whether narcissism has in fact grown from one generation to the next. Frankly, it\u0027s hard to make any valid, reliable statements about what millions of people who happened to born in the same two decades have in common.Comments (48)Lauren HershNew York Office Director, Equality NowYou see, we\u0027ve always dreamed that one day, when we left our high school hallways, we\u0027d be free of certain painful things like standardized tests, Chaucer, and...slut-shaming. You brought us back to a heartbreaking, frustrating reality.CommentsAndy McDonaldFellow, The Huffington PostOkay, how about we compromise? I\u0027ll still throw out some disturbing statistics about the welfare of American children, but I\u0027ll punctuate them with some sweet ass alley-ooping pool dunks! Gooooooooo TEAM!CommentsSusanna QuinnWriterI\u0027m not suggesting for a moment that women are less capable than men of wrongdoing. But it is rather evident that women in politics seem vastly less inclined actually to fall victim to the temptations of sin.Comments (106)Shaker AamerPrisonnier britannique à GuantanamoMy name is Shaker. I am also known as Sawad Al-Madany because I was born in the Holy City of Medina. Please can you remember these names for me, because I hardly can anymore. Here, they call me 239. In fact, I call myself 239.Comments (646)Imam Khalid Latif, 2013. 3.08Michael Sigman, 2013. 3.08Mary Ellen Harte, 2013. 3.08Trita Parsi, 2013. 3.08Antwaun Sargent, 2013. 3.08Jackie K.
