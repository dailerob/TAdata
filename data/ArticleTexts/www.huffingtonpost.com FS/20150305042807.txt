{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Taking on the moneyed interests is risky, especially when those interests have more economic and political power than at any time since the first Gilded Age. These interests are, after all, the main sources of campaign funding. But a failure to take them on prevents any real change in the prospects of the bottom 90 percent of Americans. It also robs the Democratic candidate of a potential public mandate to change the prevailing allocation of economic and political power -- no less dramatically than it was changed by Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson a century ago, marking the end of that Gilded Age. And a failure to take on the moneyed interests sacrifices the potential enthusiasm of millions of voters -- Democrats and Republicans alike -- who know the game is rigged, and who yearn for a leader with the strength and courage to un-rig it, and thereby give them and their children a fair chance.To allow an Israeli politician to use the venue of the United States Congress as a platform for political grandstanding in support of his re-election bid is equally demeaning to Americans and Israelis alike.Author, \u0027Dangerous Ground\u0027This year, whether by design or coincidence, CPAC successfully covered all its bases by featuring dumbstupids spanning three generations. Who were these multi-generational representatives of the increasingly marginalized far-right brand?Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027If you want to join us in building a world of respect and connectedness, then your directive is clear and simple: be good to people with intellectual disabilities.Co-founder, Spread the Word to End the WordCo-founder, Spread the Word to End the WordDeclassified high-level documents from Britain, France, Russia and the United States reveal that Egypt, Syria, and Jordan were not going to attack Israel and Israel knew it. In fact, they did not attack Israel. Instead, Israel mounted the first attack in order to decimate the Egyptian army and take the West Bank.Professor, Thomas Jefferson School of Law5. This argument makes clear how important it is to have the right Justices on the Supreme Court. It\u0027s not just for the big-forest constitutional questions but for the in-the-trees statutory questions where a lot of our law is made, and where all of us have a very important stake.American University Law Prof, MD State Senator, People For the American Way Senior FellowSo CPAC happened, at which various GOP future candidates try to see if they can win a little conservative love. And that means that Common Core had to be trotted out for ceremonial abuse, like a disgraced former party officer in Communist China.Teacher and writer; blogger, curmudgucation.blogspot.comInsofar as the prospective candidates for President of the United States pay attention to public opinion research, they should be careful about interpreting the polls on global climate change. They might get the mistaken impression that voters don\u0027t care.Executive Director, Presidential Climate Action ProjectEven after having Pip, close people in my life still use the word without thinking. And while I\u0027m not normally an \"R-Word Crusader,\" I do have to honestly admit I cringe inside each and every time I hear it said.Mother and writerOne of the tiredest clichés in all of American politics -- and a favorite of D.C. \"centrists\" -- is that economic populism is all about beating up on the rich and redistributing income instead of pursuing economic growth. But Elizabeth Warren and her fellow progressives are not, either in rhetoric or policy, anti-growth or anti-business or out to \"soak\" the rich.Co-Founder, Democracy PartnersNetanyahu\u0027s speech to Congress was brilliantly deceitful because it played to the fantasies that Israeli propaganda and right wing militarists in the US have been popularizing for the past thirty years.Editor, Tikkun MagazineFrom now on, American criticism of Israeli policies will be much more visible that it has been. Not just on Iran, but on settlement policy, citizenship issues and the role of the observant religious community.Senior Fellow, DemosIt\u0027s not fair. Everybody deserves the right to express him or herself, without the fear that someone will treat you differently because of it.Freshman at George Mason UniversityIt worries me that boys are told that showing emotion is a weakness. And don\u0027t get me started on their notion of invincibility and willingness to jump off sheer cliff faces just for the hell of it. So, with all of this in mind, I\u0027ve done a lot of thinking about how I can raise my boys to be good men.Writer, mum, wife, feminist, northern expat, PND survivor. In no particular order.The thought of kids failing in school because they lacked such a simple thing - breakfast - makes me crazy. But we can do something about it.We know there is a sensible bipartisan majority that is willing to compromise and do what has to be done to keep the basic functions of government operating; they voted yesterday. And the leadership should find a way to let that sensible majority govern despite those who take every opportunity to make governing next to impossible in this body.Congressman Representing Illinois\u0027 4th District in ChicagoThe asset boom combined with wage stagnation have only intensified our nation\u0027s disparity disorder, the prime metaphor for which is Walmart and its heirs, the Waltons.Author/artist, The Greyhound Diaries -- a 100,000-mile odyssey in song, story, and imageDerick Dillard, husband of 19 Kids and Counting daughter Jill Duggard, has something of a PR cat-astrophy on his hands.Animal Welfare Editor, The Huffington PostViolence against women and girls is an epidemic of global proportions. Transcending geographic borders, economic and social class, religion and ethnicity, violence impacts women of all ages, in all communities around the world.Vice Chair, Clinton FoundationThe art of making appetizing cocktails is not something you\u0027re just born with.Liquor.comMy daughter Alexandra \"Alex\" Scott, the creator of Alex\u0027s Lemonade Stand Foundation, would be 19 years old now, and I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a shock to learn that I often wonder what she would be like today.Co-Executive Director, Alex’s Lemonade Stand FoundationMay you always be so proud of your body -- pointing out your beautiful belly and happy to see your reflection in the mirror. You only get one body, so continue to love it.Mom, blogger, health coach and fitness instructorIf the following life lessons don\u0027t immediately apply to you, just know that a life lived on the most isolated landmass in the world -- Hawaii -- will start to, well, isolate you from some things after a while.James Cave is an associate editor at HuffPost Hawaii.After many years of neglecting sleep\u0027s importance in our lives, we\u0027ve entered a golden age of sleep studies. Christian Benedict, a neuroscientist at Uppsala University in Sweden, is helping lead this scientific movement, with a particular emphasis on how sleep is connected to performance in school.I\u0027m sympathetic to the notion that since we already have lower tariffs than our trading partners, there are gains to be made on this front. But if the negotiators are truly saying we simply cannot have a trade deal that blocks currency managers, then maybe we shouldn\u0027t have a trade deal.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorAs the trial recreates the crime and its repercussions in devastating detail, one concern is the likelihood that Boston will be traumatized all over again and that deep emotional wounds that victims have worked hard to heal will inevitably be torn back open.Host of the public radio series “Humankind”Here are a few of the most blatant ways that your lack of familiarity with local culture in Europe can bring you public shame and humiliation, plus advice on keeping it cool while abroad.Smartertravel.comA simple $5 trigger lock can save a life.

And then I\u0027m at a restaurant and spy a cheese plate on the menu and it even includes Gruyere. Oh Gruyere, you are my weakness.Executive editor, The DodoSome don\u0027t believe they are worthy of love, so they bully others into being with them, or they give themselves away so people won\u0027t leave them. They hope another person will heal them.Zen Parenting Radio Host, Author, Self-Awareness TeacherGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"THE WILD CARDS Capricious Kennedy...
