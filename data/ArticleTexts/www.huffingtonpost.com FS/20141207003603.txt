{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Executive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostMy casual faith in America is the part of me -- thoroughly grounded in white privilege -- that has believed without overmuch reflection that our country values equality of all races at its core; that our laws and policing are color blind in their practice; that the efforts of politicians, business leaders and clergy are sincerely geared towards serving all the people; and that America is steadily progressing on the path towards a \u0027more perfect union,\u0027 to quote our president. My \u0027faith\u0027 in America was based on things hoped for but as yet unseen (to borrow from Hebrews 11:1). But more importantly, it was based on things hoped for, but not worked for -- at least not very hard.When voters pass minimum wage hikes in four of the reddest states--Alaska, South Dakota, Nebraska, Arkansas--but still reject Democrats nationally and, perhaps more troublesome, even locally, that should tell you something. It also provides more clarity in terms of the lessons of this election.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027One can only hope that Ashton Carter has moved past his glib endorsements of Donald Rumsfeld\u0027s disingenuous \"group think\" and Neil McElroy\u0027s outright distortion of the truth and on to a personal code of conduct where speaking truth to power is not seen as a vice, but rather a virtue.Author, \u0027Dangerous Ground\u0027Yet scientists are discovering that what society says about men\u0027s (and boys\u0027) social and emotional abilities is simply not true, and that cultivating their natural capacity for emotional attunement and relationships is critical to their overall well-being. But we need to start when they\u0027re young.Education Director, Greater Good Science Center (GGSC)The tragedy of Ferguson has certainly generated a national conversation about race, about the over-militarization of local police departments, about the excessive use of force and about the prosecutor\u0027s abuse of the notoriously unfair Grand Jury system.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027For all the debate about the specifics of each case, and the need for body cameras, reformed grand jury procedures, training, diverse police forces and alike, the Garner case brings another critical macro issue to the surface about the intensity of policing in a time of low crime rates.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityMany headlines and statistics cited throughout the media regarding female sexuality, I\u0027ve learned, derive from myths or studies that are outdated, misinterpreted or blown way out of proportion.Health and sexuality writer, radio personality and activistI\u0027m not the type of person who likes to keep secrets. I grew up in a house where secrets floated in the air at all times, and I never liked to keep track of who knew what. But when I realized at the age of sixteen that I was a lesbian, I suddenly had my own secret to keep track of.Writer of essays, fiction, and poetry at the intersections of food, fertility, and cultureSometimes childhood experiences motivate a lifetime of extraordinary work. That is certainly true for Georgetown University Law School professor and bioethicist Patricia King, a brilliant scholar and one of the most effective leaders you may not know.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe lawyer\u0027s work and that of the detective\u0027s long hours is how many mysteries have been solved -- or not. And then DNA entered criminology to add to the writer\u0027s magical box of solutions. Here is an example in my own case.Author and Historian; author of the acclaimed Anjou Trilogy and frequent lecturer and historical writer.We need a bold inter-racial movement to demand social justice for all of America\u0027s sons and daughters. That movement is already underway.E.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeHomemade treats make wonderful holiday gifts -- and wouldn\u0027t you rather spend time in your kitchen than brave the crowds at the mall?Once Upon a ChefI held my boyfriend\u0027s hand the other day. I caught it and held it until we reached the main gates of University College Cork, as I usually do on campus, only this time I didn\u0027t let go after we\u0027d passed through. We moved along the Western Road, toward Washington Street, and as we reached the innards of Cork City, something strange lingered over me.Philosopher, philanthropist, student, writer.It\u0027s almost impossible to stop yourself from procrastinating or wasting time if you are not engaging in activities that matter to you. And organizing your time around yourself is no easy task. You must take time, each and every day, to check in with yourself. Are you on track?Chairman and CEO of S. Graham \u0026 AssociatesIt shouldn\u0027t be difficult for Democrats to remember what they stand for. These four messages support populist values. They also serve to differentiate the likely Democratic presidential candidate from any Republican.Berkeley writer, retired Silicon Valley executiveThe surest way to avoid ever having your most private photos shared publicly is to not take them in the first place. This is the philosophy behind the most common advice given to teens, among whom the rates of \"sexting\" continue to rise. Trust no one. Share nothing. Even better: Take nothing. It\u0027s ridiculous logic.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarThe first year, I didn\u0027t cook Thanksgiving dinner or shop for Christmas presents. I had other children, sure. But I didn\u0027t have Emma, and that defined meAuthor, mother, and talent consultant for a major financial institution.The easiest way to shorthand Margaret and Walter Keane\u0027s story is to call it \"stranger than fiction.\" Perhaps we fought for ten years to make a film about them, because this was truly one of the most insane real-life tales we\u0027d ever encountered.Writers/producers on Tim Burton\u0027s \u0027BIG EYES\u0027There is overt violence, and there is structural violence. The video of Eric Garner\u0027s death shows us an act of overt violence. The larger events which led to his death were acts of structural violence.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourThe bottom line is that anti-vaccine sentiment and associated conspiracy theories are a luxury accessible only to societies largely spared the historical toll of dreadful, vaccine-preventable diseases. If our children were still prone to polio, any anti-vaccine evangelists would be trampled by the mob rushing to the immunization clinicDirector, Yale Prevention Research CenterThe review of CIA interrogation methods during George W. Bush\u0027s presidency has been the subject of a contentious back-and-forth, with U.S. intelligence agencies and the White House on one side pushing for mass redactions in the name of national security and committee staffers on the other arguing that the proposed redactions render the report unintelligible.Senior Writer, The InterceptAnderson is the embodiment of hate and makes the late Fred Phelps of the Westboro Baptist Church look like Ghandi.Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesThe program is a winner. Congress should support the loan program or, even better, create a long-term, self-sustaining, energy infrastructure bank modeled on the very program some once mistakenly attacked.CEO, Greenbanc Global, clean energy investment/consulting firm. Headed federal government\u0027s $50 billion clean energy investment fund.It\u0027s past time to fix it, and the church must stand alongside a new generation of young leaders and help the nation find the way forward.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersThe role of the prosecutor in America is a powerful one perhaps unequaled in both power and envy. They execute their duties with almost unbridled discretion and their decisions to charge or not are exercised with virtually no immediate accountability save the ballot box.President and General Counsel, LatinoJustice PRLDEFMastering the standing posture is the first step in being able to incorporate meditation into our daily lives. Like everything worthwhile in life, it requires practice, but once we get used to it, we can do it almost anywhere -- standing on line, at the crosswalk, and in elevators.Disciple and attendant of Seon Master SongdamI\u0027ve been working on this piece for over a year and it\u0027s gone through many incarnations. Throughout the process, I\u0027ve learned that silence doesn\u0027t make things better, but knowing that silence isn\u0027t the answer wasn\u0027t enough to get me to speak out. Rather, it was you.Writer, Speaker, and Entrepreneur. www.pippabiddle.comWe are all left wondering what will have to happen before there is accountability and an honest recognition of the enormous problem we face as a country, as the bitter taste of despair fills our mouths.Director, ACLU National Office\u0027s Racial Justice ProgramIf you\u0027re going to be an alternative to Hillary, you have to be an alternative to Hillary all the way around, not just on corporate power and the economy.Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicyHow much have you considered the purpose of your dreams, and the influence they might have over your waking life? Two recent studies explore dreaming from different angles, in search of deeper understanding of the purpose of this fascinating -- and relatively little understood -- aspect of our lives.Clinical Psychologist; Board Certified Sleep SpecialistWe are both sobered and saddened by this steady drumbeat of horrific news about our colleagues trying to do their jobs. We realize that the rules of field reporting, particularly in places such as Iraq and Syria, have radically changed.Training a new generation of international correspondents in the digital ageGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"PHILIPPINES HIT AGAIN",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
