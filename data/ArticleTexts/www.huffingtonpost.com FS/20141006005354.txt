{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week included the holiest day on the Jewish calendar, Yom Kippur -- The Day of Atonement. This ritual of self-examination and seeking forgiveness is one we could all benefit from. And as this week\u0027s headlines demonstrate, there is certainly no shortage of opportunities for public figures to do so. The day after the head of the Secret Service resigned, it was revealed that, just last week, a man impersonating a Congressman had gotten backstage at an event attended by President Obama. In Texas, health officials disclosed that the doctors who saw the first Ebola patient diagnosed in the U.S. initially sent him home, thinking he had a low-level infection. And while Friday\u0027s jobs numbers delivered the lowest unemployment rate since 2008, participation in the labor force is at its lowest level in 36 years. No matter which religious traditions you embrace, there\u0027s never a bad time for sober reflection on how we, as individuals and as a country, could be doing better.Hong Kong\u0027s students have started that struggle -- for them, there. But their ideals are ours too, as is the flaw in the system they attack. We should be demanding the reform for which they are now fighting: an unbiased election, at every important stage.Author, \u0027Republic, Lost\u0027; Founder, RootstrikersI went back to Target today with my daughter after my discussion with them. I wanted to take pictures to document the current state of the clothes in their children\u0027s and juniors\u0027 departments so that I can look back in a few months and see how much of a difference our voices have made. Hopefully we will see a lot of change very soon. This is what I found today.Blogger, Binkies and BriefcasesAs with all theoretical revolutions, supply-side economics revealed its shortcomings when put to use and its star has now faded. But it held sway in the halls of power in the early days of the talent revolution -- a decade whose seismic shift is still sending out aftershocks.Author, \u0027Fixing the Game\u0027A few weeks ago, as Ebola slipped down the world\u0027s list of priorities, I woke up in the middle of the night knowing I had to do something, in whatever way I could, to help fight the spread of this virus.Actor, musician and producerIf this bothers you -- as it should -- look. Think. Research. Donate if you can. Spread the word. Share. I don\u0027t want any other parent to know firsthand what pediatric cancer looks like.Blogger, Kissing The FrogThe ocean covers 45 percent of the planet, produces almost half of all the oxygen we breathe and sequesters more than a quarter of the CO2 we emit into the atmosphere.Founder, Virgin GroupIn my first marriage, which lasted 18 years, I had a hard time being seen naked. Especially in my child-bearing years, when my only purpose was to serve my children, to be their sustenance. My sexuality went right out the window.Dating Guru, Mom Butler, Wife Dominatrix, Slightly MustachioedThe president claims that, despite the provisions of the War Powers Act, his continuing attacks on ISIS have an alternative foundation. On his view, President Bush did all the necessary work a decade ago when he convinced Congress to approve his wars against Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein.Professor of law and political science, Yale; Author \u0027The Decline and Fall of the American Republic\u0027The answer lies in human psychology. And probably like the old observation about history, people who refuse to understand human psychology are doomed to be victims of psychological manipulation.Former FBI Special AgentAnimal agriculture is responsible for producing more climate change gases than every car, boat, bus, truck, motorcycle and airplane on the planet. Combined.DJ, singer-songwriter and musicianHow would you like to help give away $100,000? It\u0027s not often that an opportunity like this comes your way. But thanks to the extraordinary generosity of the Learning By Giving Foundation, we have one.Founder of Stanford Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society; Founder of Silicon Valley Social Venture Fund (SV2); Author, \u0027Giving 2.0: Transform Your Giving and Our World\u0027What must this past season have been like for a man with still so much life before him, hearing all those eulogies to his youth? \"Ballplayer\" is the only identity Jeter has ever known, and now, at an age when many are only getting started, he will have to redefine his life.Host, \u0027Dan Rather Presents\u0027The framers of the U.S. Constitution could not have foreseen a time in which technology allowed more than 2.7 billion people to communicate via interconnected digital platforms. Nor could they have envisioned a world in which companies like AT\u0026T, Comcast and Verizon wield more authority over free speech than a British monarch.Senior Director of Strategy, Free PressTo continue the national conversation about how we can put an end to domestic violence, my foundation, When Georgia Smiled, has partnered with Verizon to lead the second annual National Summit for a Dialogue on Domestic Violence: A Day to Connect, Inspire and Heal on Friday, Oct. 3.

Whether Congress debates it or not.Senior Military Correspondent, The Huffington PostWe wanted to show that we are still in peril, but more, we have the means to solve our problems in the present. There are many reasons to be optimistic and hopeful.Co-founder, Environmental Media AssociationIf there\u0027s one thing we should have learned over the past 13 years of war, it\u0027s that war is good business for those in the business of war. Unfortunately, while profits for the Pentagon\u0027s contractors increase, so does the cost to taxpayers in billions in waste, fraud, and abuse.Director, Arms and Security Project, Center for International PolicyAdvocacy Director, Win Without WarThe tempo already has quickened as the could-be candidates skittishly begin to flex and caper in preparation for the big race: the run for the White House. This is a field day for the touts who are ever claiming the inside scoop about this one\u0027s strategy and that one\u0027s form. The smallest signs are seized upon as omens of what is to come.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghFueled by our fury over the responses we were getting because we weren\u0027t BALD, a lot of us wrote TODAY back to explain how gutted we by the fact that a lot of women are getting left out of the conversation, by the media perpetuation that you must LOOK sick in order to BE sick.Blogger, mother, Stage 4 cancer fighterThese decisions are a significant turnabout from a month ago, when Turkey seemed reluctant to get involved. What is driving the AKP to join the American effort against ISIL?Professor of Modern Middle East and South Asian History, University of MichiganIf I have gay children, I\u0027ll love them. I don\u0027t mean some token, distant, tolerant love that stays at a safe arm\u0027s length. It will be an extravagant, open-hearted, unapologetic, lavish, embarrassing-them-in-the-school cafeteria, kind of love.Irreverent, Relevant, and Revealing RabbiBelieve us when we tell you that there are many other parents out there with kids waaaay more f\u0027ed up than yours.

Here are 17 anonymous submissions from parents who gladly wrote down \"The Most F-Ed Up Thing My Kid Has Done.\"Hosts of The Pump and Dump Show: A Parentally Incorrect Comedy Show and Night Out, For OnceGDP growth is less and less relevant to the wellbeing of most Americans.

We\u0027ve lost many patients since opening the ETU almost two weeks ago, but tonight -- my very last night here -- it doesn\u0027t look like anyone\u0027s going to die.Assistant Professor of Emergency Medicine, Brown Medical SchoolPlease join us in urging Congress to take action now in 2014 when they return to Washington for the lame duck legislative session. Ask Congress to extend funding now for Children\u0027s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for four more years. We must not allow children to lose ground.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundUndoubtedly there are positives to Holder\u0027s tenure as attorney general, but one really big minus is his decision not to prosecute any of the Wall Street crew whose actions helped to prop up the housing bubble.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027The Good Lie is the story of some of the \"Lost Boys\" of Sudan. It stars Reese Witherspoon. She helps the Lost Boys, but as is so often the case when we respond to God\u0027s call to care for our neighbor, they probably help her more.
