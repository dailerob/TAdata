{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Absent gross mischief to hold down or dilute minority voting, key southern states are on track to shift from red to purple, (Texas, Georgia) and from purple to blue (Florida, North Carolina, Virginia). Other states that used to be reliably Republican such as Colorado are becoming more heavily Democratic thanks both to shifting demographics and changing views on social issues. So we have quite simply a race between demographic and ideological change and flat-out voter suppression. In the 1960s, thanks to the civil rights movement, the liberal wing of a still moderate Republican Party, and Lyndon Johnson\u0027s legendary arm-twisting, the great civil rights acts of 1964, 1965 and 1968 passed Congress with a lot of Republican support. It was the Democrats who were split between northern progressives and diehard segregationist Dixiecrats. Today, however, the obstructionists and vote suppressors are all Republicans. Ultimately, this will not be lost on a changing electorate. The forces of anti-democracy have won this round, but if the progressive movement gets itself organized, this victory for Republicans will be Pyrrhic.CommentsJedediah PurdyProfessor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027Reading Walden through Anthropocene eyes, insight and appreciation of nature seem to emerge from, even require, rupture and profanation. Maybe these are unavoidable parts of an appreciative relation to the world. Maybe the imperfect has always been our only paradise.CommentsDr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarIf a workplace is becoming more emotion-friendly, women certainly have at least something to do with it. It\u0027s with the greatest caution that I commit to print the idea that women are more emotional than men. Back away from that Tweet. Science is on my side.Comments (72)John PavleyCTO @ The Huffington Post, BloggerRichard Bartle, one of the original coders of the whole MUD (multi-user dungeons) and gaming industry, has written an easy to comprehend and richly detailed look at the history, design, development, and marketing of virtual worlds.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorWhat I find striking is a pervasive denial of the reality that economies are always fraught with uncertainty, as is much else in life, of course. So how is it that in recent years, this has become a major complaint?CommentsMohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOIf you still have room on your summer reading list, here are three books that will familiarize you with concepts and tools that I think you might find very useful in both your personal and professional lives. Together they provide theoretical and practical approaches to deal with today\u0027s fluid and complex world.CommentsBeth HopkinsWriter, Advocate, HumoristMy devotion to my Faith and its teachings about marriage does not mean I have the right to make anyone else\u0027s faith or marriage illegal. And it doesn\u0027t mean I should be unkind, rude, or unloving toward anyone, whether my theology agrees with their lifestyle choices or not.CommentsSubhankar BanerjeeFounder, ClimateStoryTellers.orgSnowden didn\u0027t \"betray\" his country, but his courageous act and Greenwald\u0027s journalism is certainly \"inciting people to rebel against the authority of [the] state.\" Viewed in this way, their act could be considered as seditious, and they are in good company -- with none other than Mahatma Gandhi.CommentsHuffPost RadioRon Reagan and Erick Erickson debate judicial matters after the DOMA and VRA decisions. But there\u0027s a larger subtext -- is Obama\u0027s center-left country and Roberts\u0027s hard-right Court moving toward a collision? Then, Obama tries to cool off the planet and the frenzy over Snowden.CommentsKristin Kirkpatrick, M.S., R.D., L.D.Manager of Wellness Nutrition Services at Cleveland Clinic Wellness InstituteFor those that have not yet embraced a tea-drinking habit, it\u0027s never too late to start brewing a batch! Explore the various types, flavors, and brands to find your tea-mate.CommentsAmanda KingBlogger, Last Mom On EarthI totally get the impulse to want to shun the topic, because the topic brings a lot of people a lot of pain. But, not talking about it doesn\u0027t prepare our girls for reality.CommentsAnson CarterHockey Analyst and Former NHL PlayerBergeron playing with a punctured lung, Hossa\u0027s wonky back, or Campbell finishing his shift on a broken leg -- none of it was anything special to watch for me as a former hockey player. That is just what hockey players do because we love the game and more importantly we love to compete.CommentsDavid CoatesWorrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsOn July 4th, we will celebrate the 18th century birth of a new nation, conceived in liberty and committed to justice for all. But there can be no genuine liberty for those without the economic and social capacity to enjoy it.Comments (21)Sam FiorellaPartner, Sensei Marketing; Author, Influence MarketingIf the public is going to hold celebrities to such high standards, should we not also hold the businesses that endorse them to similar standards?Comments (15)Dr. Dohee Kim-AppelAssociate Professor of Art Therapy and Counseling, Ursuline CollegeIf one is a prisoner, are we not all in some way, a prisoner also? Hyeonseo Lee fought for her family and their lives. One may not know what they are capable of until tested.CommentsTerry NewellFounder, Leadership for a Responsible SocietyAmericans routinely decry the inefficiency of government. Why, they ask, can\u0027t it be run more like a private sector company? To road-test this idea, let\u0027s think about one of the best run, most admired private sector companies in America: Google.Comments (65)Jessica AshleyWriter at SassafrassPeople who don\u0027t hold a belief in spirit or higher power or religion or faith may bristle here.

Let me share the silver linings of divorce.CommentsJohn BrownAdjunct Professor of Liberal Studies, Georgetown UniversityYes, let\u0027s read, write, and use the Internet, but let\u0027s not abandon the miraculous pleasure of speaking in the real world with identifiable persons other than ourselves.CommentsMelanie StoneJournalism major, University of IllinoisI withdrew from the University of Illinois in September 2012. The ceiling fan in my bedroom whirred softly as I lay beneath it that morning, crying, then sleeping, then crying some more. I was miles away from my life in Champaign, surrendering to an eating disorder that had been holding me captive for one long year.CommentsAshley CardenasMother, children\u0027s health care advocateAs a parent you never want to think that you can\u0027t afford any or all medical necessities that your child might need to stay alive.

It\u0027s something that will probably follow her for the rest of her career but it isn\u0027t something that she thinks about. Lane is always looking ahead, never back.CommentsCraig S. KeenerProfessor, Asbury Theological Seminary, and author of many books\"I don\u0027t know whether I\u0027m going to live or die,\" she lamented frantically.
