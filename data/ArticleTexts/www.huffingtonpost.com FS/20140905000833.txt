{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor of Political Science, UCLAThe Bush administration erred grievously in allowing Hamas to run candidates in the 2006 Palestinian elections, even though it continued to maintain arms of its own and refused to recognize the existence of Israel, renounce violence, and accept previous agreements with Israel reached by the PLO and the Palestinian Authority. The Obama administration continued the error when it abided by the status quo. The outcome is that the world has all but forgotten the extremist Islamist nature of Hamas, its rejection of the two-state solution, and its building rockets and tunnels rather than houses and factories. With an indefinite ceasefire now agreed upon, there is an urgent need for a new strategy that will be aimed at ending the Hamas stranglehold on Gaza, substantially increase the role of the Palestinian Authority there, and enhance the prospects for progress in Israeli-Palestinian relations.Thank you on behalf of all comedians working today who know that you always fought the enemies of comedy. You controlled the room always, in the most professional way. You leveled the playing ground for all comedians. You\u0027ll be missed, but not forgotten. Copied but never matched. Never bested.Presidential Candidate, Peace and Freedom PartyWe have a global warming president presiding over a massive expansion of fossil fuel production. Think of this as a form of collective mental compartmentalization that should frighten us all -- and yet from the president on down, it\u0027s remarkable how few seem disturbed by it.Author and Professor of Peace and World-Security Studies, Hampshire CollegeIf the Walton family is truly interested in helping every child achieve a high-quality education, they could begin by committing to pay their own workers a decent wage instead of spending their billions to wipe out our nation\u0027s public school system.President, American Federation of TeachersInternational President, United Food and Commercial Workers UnionWhile Libya may not make the front page on a daily basis, it stands as the latest example of blowback, the adverse consequences of our reflexive military intervention.Former 16-year member of the U.S. Congress and two-time U.S. presidential candidateFive dogs. 12 weeks. Increased compassion. Better sleep. More patience. Peace of mind. Improved relationships. Smiles. Opened hearts. Expressed emotions. More unconditional love. At a maximum security prison. And the dogs didn\u0027t charge for their services.Wellness Editor, The Huffington Post; Doctor of acupuncture and Oriental medicine; Nutritionist; Animal Welfare AdvocateAs surely -- if not as enthusiastically -- as his predecessor, Obama has succumbed to the powerful systemic pressures that serve the needs of the military-intelligence-industrial complex. Secrecy is rampant. Politics drives policy. There is no accountability.Senior Writer, The InterceptOver two nights, our conversation covered many things -- her devotion to her family, her legendary work ethic, her delight in making people laugh -- and then it took on what turned out to be a prescient dimension.PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorThere\u0027s no doubt college can be a wonderful experience. But for some, it will be a nightmare. Specifically the nightmare of sexual assault for one in five female coeds. You read that right -- one in five.Money Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsIn our rush to return to war in Iraq we are playing into the Islamic State\u0027s hands, just as we played into the hands of al Qaeda in Iraq in 2004 and into Osama bin Laden\u0027s larger strategy with our morally disastrous Global War on Terror.Senior Fellow, Center for International Policy; Board of Directors, Council for a Livable World; MatthewHoh.comRussia\u0027s invasion of the Ukraine is following a time-honored pattern of Putin\u0027s foreign policy: foment dissent with separatists, destabilize your neighbor\u0027s regimes, and invade to conquer part of that country.Political science professor, LaGrange College in GeorgiaThe NFL should recognize that the degrees of separation between overt bigotry and unconscious biases may be few, and the effects equally harmful. If a team failed to draft Sam based on his sexual orientation, the team discriminated against him and should consider the rightness of its actions.National Diversity Expert; Principal and Chief Strategist of Criticality Management Consulting; Former Associate Dean of Harvard CollegeI left that sucker in the shower for my husband to see. The look on his face was priceless: \"Did you just...?\" \"Oh, shoot. Did I leave that in there?\" As I sashayed off to make breakfast.Blogger, \"Hot Flashes of Inspiration\"After more than a decade of vigorous research into the deadly Ebola virus, a handful of potential treatment therapies appear to finally be on the horizon.Joan Rivers had a barbed tongue but she also had a soft spot for animals. Despite her penchant for wearing fur, Joan always appreciated PETA\u0027s efforts.Senior vice president, PETA; Author, Committed: A Rabble Rouser\u0027s MemoirPlaying a sport like football teaches you how to \"summon the beast.\" But growing up means learning what to do with those passions after the end of the fourth quarter. Edmundson\u0027s \"education in the game\" has been so potent because he hasn\u0027t left its lessons on the field.President, Wesleyan UniversityBlack and brown people are not so much strangers in a strange land, you see. Far worse, we are strangers in our own homeland.Director, ACLU National Office\u0027s Racial Justice ProgramMy favorite part of being an author is writing. A close second is finding new books in my mailbox. This fall, there\u0027s an unusually exciting crop of big idea and business books about human behavior, innovation and entrepreneurship, and the fundamental questions of success, meaning, and happiness in work and life.Wharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027These indescribably horrid beheadings were meant to send a message to President Obama, however the reverberations hit especially hard with journalists and news gathering operations everywhere.Host, \u0027Dan Rather Presents\u0027Confidence in institutions, particularly government, is dipping dangerously low. If it goes much further we may end up in an unbreakable spiral whereby America becomes a helpless, passive entity in the world. Rather than wallow in our pessimism or aim for small, incremental solutions, we need to do things that captivate people\u0027s minds.Senior Fellow at the Bipartisan Policy CenterIt\u0027s probably our most versatile word. It can be a noun, a verb, or an involuntary shriek of agony if you hit your thumb with a hammer. It can be used in love, in lust, in hate or in any other emotional situation you can imagine.Author, \u0027F**k: An Irreverent History of the F-word\u0027We will all mourn Michael Brown\u0027s death and wait to know more about what happened that night. What is clear, however, is that platitudes about \"starting a conversation\" will not do.Professor of Law at Cardozo School of LawThe anger at Amber Rose comes from a place of fear -- all hate is fear, at its root -- fear of a woman who exists outside of patriarchal parameters. How else can she be controlled? But for women, I also hear the anger coming from a place of envy.Poet, author, and activistWho Is Arthur Chu? Arthur Chu is nobody special. Just another loser. A loser who\u0027s had a run of good luck and is trying to leverage that into doing better. And being better.\u0027Jeopardy!\u0027 champion, voice-over artist, actor, comedianSoon, all that will be left for human beings will be the non-routine, creative work.Futurist, researcher and writerWomen who look at J Law\u0027s nude photos may do so in order to compare their own bodies to hers. It\u0027s not so much about sexually wanting her (though that may be true, too) as it is about wanting to sexually be her.practical dreamer. hopeful realist. ravishly.com co-editor.The Netanyahu-led government\u0027s announcement of its decision to annex nearly 1,000 acres of Palestinian land in the West Bank between the Etzion settlement block and Jerusalem amounts to nothing less than a reckless and offensive act that only further undermines Israel\u0027s moral international standing and has dire future consequences.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUWith a press that regards itself as having fulfilled its responsibilities when it treats the truth and the lie evenhandedly, is it any wonder that we are in an era where the lie so often defeats the truth?Award-winning author, political commentator, and talk radio philosopher; Democratic nominee for Congress in VA-06 in 2012.There really can be no losers in a competition to out-love someone, can there? Everybody participating wins.Blogger, A Morning GrouchAs the world burns, our political class whoops it up with the plutocracy, whether in Martha\u0027s Vineyard or at the Kochs\u0027 posh retreat in southern California.Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanySenior writer, Moyers \u0026 Company on public TV.
