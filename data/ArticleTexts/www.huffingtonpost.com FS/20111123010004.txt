{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This weekend, while listening to an NPR story about police using tear gas and rubber bullets to break up a demonstration, I was actually surprised when it turned out the newscaster was talking about Tahrir Square -- I had assumed it was about another brutal response to a peaceful protest here at home. All across the country -- most recently on the campus of UC Davis -- a war is being waged. But this isn\u0027t a battle over parks and tents and sleeping bags. This is a battle about our leaders\u0027 credibility. Indeed, the Occupy movement has been a test -- a national MRI -- that has allowed us to check-in on the health of our democracy by allowing us to see what\u0027s going on underneath the surface of America\u0027s power structures. And the results are dire. What the movement, and the response to it, has shown is a government almost completely disconnected from those it purports to represent.Read Post | Comments (938)Marlo Thomas and Jennifer Aniston, 11/22/11For a few years, we had a great time playing mother and daughter on Friends. But far from a Hollywood TV studio, we forged a bond that was even more lasting for us -- by joining together to help families who are fighting for the lives of their children.Read Post | Comments (22)Robert Reich, 11/22/11Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Aftershock\u0027The First Amendment is being stood on its head. Money speaks, and an unlimited amount of it can now be spent bribing and cajoling politicians. Yet peaceful assembly is viewed as a public nuisance and removed by force.Read Post | Comments (316)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 11/22/11Author, \u0027Our Fathers Ourselves. Daughters, Fathers, And The Changing American Family\u0027It\u0027s wonderful what dogs do for us.

But then she discovered Fox News and Rush Limbaugh, and I could not have anticipated the devastating way this would change our relationship.Read Post | Comments (330)Simon Curtis, 11/22/11Director, \u0027My Week With Marilyn\u0027Watching Michelle Williams\u0027 performance as Marilyn evolve on set each day ranks as the most thrilling experience of my career.Read Post | CommentsJesse Tyler Ferguson, 11/22/11Actor, \u0027Modern Family\u0027I was taught how to cook a turkey dinner by none other than Martha Stewart. Not through the help of her website or cookbooks. Oh no!

The lighting of the tree at Rockefeller Center. The Macy\u0027s parade. Another desperate ploy for publicity by Donald Trump.Read Post | CommentsBill McKibben and Van Jones, 11/22/11Since climate change is the first truly global problem, those people have to figure out how to raise a common message, one that crosses the boundaries of language. The best method -- proven in countless social movements -- may be music.Read Post | Comments (16)John Stoehr, 11/22/11Editor, New Haven Advocate; Lecturer, Yale UniversityThese are not conflicts between rivals of equal proportion, as \"clash\" connotes. These are incidents of police violence and media should start calling it for what it is. With so much amateur video, the media has little choice but to set aside convention and report what\u0027s happening.Read Post | Comments (13)Elliott Negin, 11/22/11Director of News \u0026 Commentary, Union of Concerned ScientistsGiven what scientists now know about the link between climate change and heat waves, floods, droughts and heavy downpours, the time for a national climate service is now. But unfortunately Congress is moving in the opposite direction.Read Post | CommentsPaula Daniels, 11/22/11Founding Chair, Los Angeles Food Policy CouncilThis big price of cheap is a paradox that is familiar to many, but in this season, the nested ironies are worth remembering.Read Post | CommentsJames Peron, 11/22/11President, Moorfield Storey InstituteIt is the legal consent of the two partners, not the ceremony, that makes a marriage valid. If you take the contractual view of marriage, you immediately see the absurdity of the concerns of people such as Tamara Scott.Read Post | Comments (30)Ed Feulner, 11/22/11President, The Heritage FoundationThe Federal Government\u0027s responsibility to provide for the common defense is listed right in the preamble of the U.S. Constitution. That is the way we can secure the blessings of liberty. That is the subject of this evening\u0027s debate.Read Post | Comments (20)Matthew Noah Smith, 11/22/11Associate professor of Philosophy, Yale UniversityWe hoped that even as politicians and municipal police violently responded to the Occupy movement, college and university campuses would remain safe locations for non-violent political dissent. But that has not been the case.Read Post | Comments (14)Peter Biro, 11/22/11Senior Communications Officer for the International Rescue CommitteeRead Post | CommentsMatthew Modine, 11/22/11Actor, Activist, Filmmaker, HumanistIt\u0027s hard to see the forest for the trees. And it\u0027s hard to see a movement when it is happening. That\u0027s where we are with Occupy Wall Street. So it\u0027s time to look back in time and read about successful campaigns by individuals that changed the course of human history.Read Post | Comments (106)Richard Simmons, 11/22/11America\u0027s most revered fitness expertYes, we should be thankful this Thursday. (And everyday, really.) But it\u0027s not about counting how many calories we can pile into our stomachs. Oh, no!
