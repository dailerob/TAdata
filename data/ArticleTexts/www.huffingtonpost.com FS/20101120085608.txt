{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Author; Editor At Large, Huffington PostThanksgiving. Its the most amazing holiday. Just think about it -- it\u0027s a miracle that once a year so many millions of Americans sit down to exactly the same meal as one another, exactly the same meal they grew up eating, and exactly the same meal they ate a year earlier. But just to stay fresh, every year HuffPost runs its annual Thanksgiving contest: Tell Us What You\u0027re Cooking For Thanksgiving This Year That You Didn\u0027t Cook Last Year. So send in those recipes and we\u0027ll pick ten winners.Read Post | CommentsSen. Bernie Sanders, 11.19.2010Independent U.S. Senator from VermontThe very richest among us want more, and they are prepared to dismantle the existing political and social order to get it. The time is late. The stakes are extraordinary. Now is the time to roll back this orgy of greed.Read Post | CommentsGeorge Clooney and John Prendergast, 11.19.2010Renewed war in Sudan is not inevitable. A complex but workable peace can be brokered if all interested parties become more deeply involved. The current moment requires robust diplomacy.Read Post | CommentsMichael Moore, 11.19.2010Oscar and Emmy-winning directorAPCO, the health insurance industry\u0027s PR firm who said it wants to push me off a cliff, has now taken on its biggest challenge yet: leading a giant, multimillion dollar effort to help Wall Street \"earn back the trust of the American people.\"Read Post | CommentsChris Rodda, 11.19.2010Senior Research Director, Military Religious Freedom Foundation; author, \"Liars For Jesus\"Glenn Beck recently promoted an idea straight out of the Paris Commune of 1871, an idea considered by the Commune to be a necessary stepping stone in the transition from capitalism to socialism to communism.Read Post | CommentsNiall O\u0027Dowd, 11.19.2010Founder, IrishCentral.comChris Christie is now a candidate for the Republicans in the way Obama was for Democrats last time, unencumbered by baggage, liked at all levels of the party so far, but still somewhat of a mystery.Read Post | CommentsAlexander Stille, 11.19.2010San Paolo Professor of International Journalism, Columbia UniversityIf the Democrats cave in to Republican demands to extend the Bush tax cuts permanently for all income groups, President Barack Obama and the Democrats will lose in 2012. And, arguably, they will deserve to lose.Read Post | CommentsLorelei Kelly, 11.19.2010Director, New Strategic Security InitiativeNow that Republicans in the House are the object of their own campaign ire (they\u0027re now \"the government\"), they need to reject the malevolent commentators on the sidelines and stand up for our institutions of civil governance.Read Post | CommentsSen. Dianne Feinstein, 11.19.2010U.S. Senator from California.We should not use our kids as guinea pigs by taking chances on a chemical that can seriously harm their immediate and long-term health. No chemical should be used in food products until it is proven to be safe.Read Post | CommentsAnders Fogh Rasmussen, 11.19.2010NATO Secretary GeneralIf NATO did not exist, it would have to be invented, because countries with shared values and a shared history of close cooperation can best address global problems like cyber-attacks and terrorism together.Read Post | CommentsTory Burch, 11.19.2010Chairman, Tory BurchThere are certain people who perfectly reflect the cultural zeitgeist. In Oprah Winfrey\u0027s case, she has consistently defined it over the last 24 years with her women-empowering talk show, magazine and incredible philanthropy.Read Post | CommentsWilliam Hartung, 11.19.2010Director of the Arms and Security Initiative at the New America FoundationIf Kyl really believes that the nuclear weapons complex needs a fresh infusion of cash, he should jump at the deal being offered by the Obama administration.Read Post | CommentsKitty Kelley, 11.19.2010America’s bestselling investigative biographerThere is no one comprehensive law that protects whistleblowers from suffering repercussions for telling the truth, even though their claims may be valid and their disclosures spare the public a great deal of pain and expense.Read Post | CommentsMichael W. Hudson, 11.19.2010Author, \"The Monster: How Predatory Lenders and Wall Street Bankers Fleeced America\"As I\u0027ve tried to make sense of the Robo-Signing, Document-Backdating Foreclosure Scandal That Never Ends, a couple of things have popped in my head: Animal House and Alan Greenspan. Stay with me here.Read Post | CommentsRabbi Shmuley Boteach, 11.19.2010Rabbi and writerMarital sex has become so pathetic that one out of three American couples are entirely platonic, while the remaining seventy percent have sex once a week for seven minutes at a time. This includes the time he spends begging.Read Post | CommentsDr. Andrew Weil, 11.19.2010Founder and director of the Arizona Center for Integrative MedicineFor four decades, I\u0027ve been skeptical of a prevailing belief in Western medicine: that when a plant shows bioactivity in humans, we must attribute that effect to a single, predominant compound in the plant.Read Post | CommentsRobert Naiman, 11.19.2010Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicyIf the demands by Haitian protesters for UN forces to leave are not just, shouldn\u0027t someone have to explain why?

Granholm, 11.19.2010Governor of MichiganIf economically-challenged Michigan can create 89,000 clean energy manufacturing jobs in three years with the right energy policies, just think what could happen for the entire country if Congress committed to clean energy.Read Post | CommentsDavid Wild, 11.18.2010TV Writer, Rolling Stone Contributing Editor and author of \"He Is . . . I Say\"Musically, Kid Rock has always been his own man.
