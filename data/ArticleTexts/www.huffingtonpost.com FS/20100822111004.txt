I was in the Ionian Islands when I read Paul Krugman\u0027s column about how we\u0027re engaging \"in human sacrifices to appease the anger of invisible gods\" -- allowing the obsession with deficit reduction to trump job creation. Surrounded by the monuments my ancestors built to appease the Greek gods, I found Krugman\u0027s analogy particularly chilling. The perverse priorities of \"the apostles of austerity\" were on display with the news that the U.S. is planning to turn much of the ongoing security work in Iraq over to private contractors -- a transition that will cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.
