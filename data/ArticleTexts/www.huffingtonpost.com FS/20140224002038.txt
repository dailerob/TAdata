{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonTonight\u0027s closing ceremony marks the end of the 2014 Winter Olympics. From Bode Miller\u0027s tears to Kate Hansen\u0027s dance moves; from America\u0027s first Ice Dancing gold to Bob Costas\u0027s gold medal in freestyle pink eye; from Adelina Sotnikova\u0027s stunning win to Shaun White\u0027s even more stunning failure; from Olympic rings that failed to light to abandoned speed skating suits, the Sochi Games delivered a host of indelible memories and their fair share of controversial decisions. There was also controversy beyond the competition, including members of Pussy Riot being whipped by angry Cossacks and protests over Russia\u0027s anti-gay laws. Of course, from Jesse Owens foiling Hitler in 1936, to the Munich massacre in 1972, to dueling boycotts in 1980 and 1984, the Olympics have never been devoid of politics. Indeed, it\u0027s the collective attention they bring to both the best and worst of humanity that captures the public imagination.CommentsMarian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundJurors agreed Michael Dunn faced no threat after he was annoyed by loud music -- coming from a car he had deliberately chosen to park next to -- and then started an argument, pulled a gun on the car\u0027s black teens, and fired three shots at the young men inside the car as they tried to drive away from him.Comments (570)Mark RuffaloActor/DirectorWhen I tell you that one in five people around the world lacks access to safe drinking water, you\u0027re likely to find that unfortunate, but you\u0027re not likely to assume that this statistic affects you. So, perhaps I should start over.Comments (60)Chelsea HandlerComedian, Host, ‘Chelsea Lately’This isn\u0027t about Bill Carter. This is about being noted as a parenthetical, reaffirming what I feel has been an underlying, yet consistent inconsistency with how I am handled as the only woman in a traditionally male field.Comments (185)Arianna HuffingtonIn this week\u0027s issue, Kate Sheppard explores the fate of one of America\u0027s most iconic species -- the grizzly bear.CommentsGeoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoHow should the University of Mississippi respond? What does it mean to say that these \"ideas have no place here\"? Assuming the individuals who did this were students, should the university expel or otherwise discipline them? Are there \"ideas\" that \"have no place\" on a university campus?Comments (106)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersBasically, if a white man feels or believes he is threatened, regardless of the facts of the case, he can be justified in shooting and killing a black man. The reality of Stand Your Ground laws in Florida and 24 more states is that racial fear and hatred is now legally justified.Comments (772)TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"It\u0027s amazing what a rigged game of Monopoly can reveal. Psychologist Paul Piff shares research showing that people who feel wealthy tend to behave badly. Why is that? And what does it mean for America?Comments (230)David BeckhamUNICEF Goodwill AmbassadorIn the Philippines 1.7 million children were forced from their homes when the Typhoon swept through their communities. I saw myself how children\u0027s lives have been destroyed and how they are slowly recovering with the help of UNICEF. As a father, it was a moving experience and the memories of the children I met will stay with me for the rest of my life.CommentsDavid Katz, M.D.Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterA new study of mammography, showing lack of survival benefit, has once again muddied these waters and muddled the relevant messaging.Comments (43)Paul Brandeis RaushenbushExecutive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostThere is a deplorable and tragic common thread that ties together recent, global acts of oppression against LGBT people: Christian complicity.Comments (926)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarStudies have long challenged the idea that nice guys finish first. So is Fallon an anomaly? Or does he represent a shift in the balance of power between the tyrants and the team players?Comments (34)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Excessive CEO pay matters not only because it takes away money that rightfully belongs to shareholders, which include pension funds and individuals with 401(k) retirement accounts. Excessive CEO pay is important because it sets a pattern for pay packages throughout the economy.Comments (216)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkWhether it is Florida or any of the other 22 states with these ridiculous and incomprehensible laws on the books, we must push back aggressively and immediately.Comments (273)James ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027The story is clearly not over. Having weathered the harsh winter, the young demonstrators in Maidan do not trust their government and are not ready to go home until they see results. The government has changed its position so many times in the past, they may do so again.CommentsSen. Claire McCaskillU.S. Senator from MissouriI was proud to work to require insurance plans under the ACA to cover services vital to new mothers, which include access to breast pumps, as well as lactation support and counseling. Unfortunately, TRICARE, the health insurance provided to members of the military and their families, does not cover some of these same critical services.CommentsCraig GieseckeChef, writer and former journalistThese days I find myself in my 60th year, living with my in-laws in Southern California as if I am a just-graduated 20-something, leafing through Craigslist and other sites looking for a job. The most frequent word I hear in job interviews is \"overqualified.\" Wait a minute.Comments (277)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorBoth sides of the aisle are spinning the report, creating a fog around minimum wage policy that may further discourage a Walmart-influenced Congress from taking any action. Given the miserly state of the minimum wage today, such a can\u0027t-do attitude is unacceptable.Comments (72)Valerie JarrettSenior Advisor to the President and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsWhat was clear in this meeting was that many of the goals the president set forth in his State of the Union address\u003c will become reality because of the strong partnerships that he and his administration have forged with leaders from the civil rights community who work hard every day to advocate equality and opportunity for all.CommentsRobert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, Beyond OutrageThe winners here are truly big winners. WhatsApp\u0027s fifty-five employees are now enormously rich. Its two founders are now billionaires. And the partners of the venture capital firm that financed it have also reaped a fortune. And the rest of us?Comments (504)Martha BurkMoney Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsThis year on President\u0027s Day I want to honor our female presidents. Oh, I forgot. There aren\u0027t any. You\u0027d think it was against the law or something. It probably would have been if the founding fathers had thought of it.Comments (87)Bernard-Henri LévyFrench philosopher and writerPeople of Maidan, you have a dream that unites you. Your dream is Europe. Not the Europe of accountants, but the Europe of values. Not the Europe of bureaucrats, but that of the spirit.Comments (22)Ingrid NewkirkPresident and co-founder, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA)Never preachy, the film simply lays bare the facts and lets viewers interpret them. It\u0027s the same strategy that animal rights organizations have used for years: Give people the information, and let them decide. And it\u0027s working.Comments (37)Leo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersA study released last month shows what each state will lose in federal funding by rejecting the Medicaid expansion. No state that refused to expand Medicaid will save money, the researchers found.Comments (182)Emma KellyFounder and Editor of Ginger Parrot (www.gingerparrot.co.uk), a website for redheadsHaving pale skin may mean that redheads burn more easily when exposed to UV rays, but their paleness can serve as an advantage. Redheads can\u0027t absorb sufficient Vitamin D due to low concentrations of eumelanin in their body.Comments (196)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistWhen we hear the words \"healthy eating,\" we immediately match up certain foods with different parts of our bodies: milk and soy for strong bones; Brussels sprouts and bok choy for the lungs; ginger for the stomach; even egg yolks and yellow corn for the eyes.But what about our hearts? Surely there\u0027s a special menu for that, right?CommentsGeorge LakoffAuthor, The Political Mind, Moral Politics and Don\u0027t Think of an Elephant!Charles J. Fillmore, one of the world\u0027s greatest linguists -- ever -- died last Thursday, February 13, at the age of 84 in San Francisco. He was the discoverer of frame semantics, who did the essential research on the nature of framing in thought and language.CommentsThe Daily MealTheDailyMeal.comWe have always believed that good food is good food.Comments (21)Bianca BoskerExecutive Tech Editor, The Huffington PostWe\u0027ve thought of Facebook\u0027s growing ecosystem of services as revolving around and expanding the core Facebook experience. We\u0027re thinking too small. Zuckerberg is dreaming of an even larger universe of services that aren\u0027t tied to Facebooking, but communicating -- full stop.Comments (14)SmarterTravelSmartertravel.comWhether you\u0027re on the prowl for a perfect beach or a city bursting with culture, these cities and countries deliver big but cost little.Comments (23)Allison TateWriter, mother of fourWe all need to be ready to throw ropes to other moms when we see them struggling; we are, after all, the ones who know how long the rope needs to be to reach them, because we have been there.Comments (48)Michael Conniff, 2014.23.02Stephen Schlesinger, 2014.23.02Carmen Zella, 2014.23.02David Macaray, 2014.23.02Norman Lear, 2014.23.02Mark J.
