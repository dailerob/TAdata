{"htmlTagMap":{"p":" See all posts »BIOOn Monday, I\u0027m going to be videotaping an exclusive HuffPost interview with Nancy Pelosi. And I\u0027d love your input on what questions I should ask. This will be an informal conversation with the Speaker, an opportunity to delve into the personal as well as the political. Of course, we\u0027ll talk about Iraq, SCHIP, FISA, and the other critical issues facing Congress as she heads into the home stretch of her first year as Speaker. But I also want to find out how she balances all her different roles, how she recharges herself, how she manages to get enough -- any -- sleep, and whether she really prays for George Bush. Let me know what questions you\u0027d like me to ask by posting them in the comments section of this post.Read Post | Comments (479)BIOBill Maher, 10.11.2007Have too many Americans become gullible, ill-informed idiots who have elevated feelings over facts and replaced critical thinking with a blind sense of trust for authority?Read Post | Comments (527)BIOLaurie David, 10.12.2007After this Nobel Prize, will it still be possible for the United States government to continue to do nothing to address the urgent crisis of global warming?Read Post | Comments (27)BIORichard Belzer, 10.12.2007The use of the term \"values voters\" to describe the so-called base of the Republicans\u0027 so-called party mainly refers to an extremist, ultra-conservative, strain of so-called Christian conservatives.Read Post | Comments (138)BIOArlene M.
