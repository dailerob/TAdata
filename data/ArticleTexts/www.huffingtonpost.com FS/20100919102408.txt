{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, Meg Whitman, running for governor of California, broke the record for personal spending on a campaign -- so far, she\u0027s donated to herself $119 million. I wonder if she regrets not using the Buy It Now option on eBay -- she probably could have gotten her campaign for a lot less. In Delaware, Christine O\u0027Donnell\u0027s upset victory was a big boost to the Tea Party movement, Sarah Palin\u0027s clout as an endorser, and comedy writers everywhere. Karl Rove wasn\u0027t happy, so O\u0027Donnell has to be doing something right. But, with all the problems we\u0027re facing, I\u0027m not sure masturbation is as big an issue for most Americans as it seems to be for O\u0027Donnell. And with unemployment so high, there are a lot of people sitting at home with time on their hands, looking for no-cost entertainment. Budget hawks rejoice: self-pleasure is deficit neutral.Read Post | CommentsElizabeth Warren, 09.17.2010Assistant to the President and Special Advisor to the Secretary of the Treasury on the Consumer Financial Protection BureauI enthusiastically agreed to serve as an Assistant to the President and Special Advisor to the Secretary of the Treasury on the CFPB.
