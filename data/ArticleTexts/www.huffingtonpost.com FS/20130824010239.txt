{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Paul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostThe anniversary of the March on Washington comes at a time when it is hard to feel that the universe is continuing to bend towards justice -- especially for African Americans. Prison populations offer a stark reminder of racial inequity, Trayvon Martin\u0027s killing went unpunished, stop and frisk targeting of African Americans has reached a boiling point, North Carolina has enacted voter suppression law, and the Supreme Court recently gutted the Voting Rights Act (VRA) that was one of the most important achievements of the civil rights movement. Right now, it seems like a combination of false satisfaction and organized attacks have the potential to flatline the arc and reverse the hard fought gains made by those who seek justice for the African American community.Comments (282)Bob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowEvery publication makes mistakes. Every major publication has, at some point, botched a story. But the way things are going with The Guardian as it publishes this series of Edward Snowden \"bombshells,\" we\u0027re well beyond isolated glitches.CommentsEleanor LongdenResearch psychologistOver the years, my voices have changed, multiplied, terrorized, inspired, and encouraged. Today they are an intrinsic, valued part of my identity, but there was also a time when their presence drove me to delirious extremes of misery, desperation, and despairComments (64)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundAs the nation celebrates the fiftieth anniversary of the March on Washington, many are discussing what Dr. King would say to the nation and world today and tell us to do. But his message to us today is as clear as it was fifty years ago if only we could hear, heed, and follow his warnings about what we need to do to make America America.CommentsMohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOThe real question today for long-term investors has less to do with the quasi-inevitably of short-term volatility that comes from expectation of monetary policy shifts in the U.S., and more with whether these short-term bad technicals will contaminate longer-term economic fundamentals.Comments (26)Lisa BelkinSenior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, The Huffington PostShe talked to him the way you talk to a child. She talked to him the way you talk to YOUR child. She saw him as a human being, not a monster, and she tried to help him.Comments (411)Bob BurnettBerkeley writer, retired Silicon Valley executiveHypnotized by a toxic blend of Reaganomics and Objectivism, Republicans don\u0027t understand how the economy works or the concerns of middle-class families.Comments (703)Arianna HuffingtonOne of the primary things keeping many businesses from adopting more sustainable metrics of success is the stubborn -- and dangerously wrongheaded -- myth that prioritizing health and well-being is incompatible with a healthy bottom line; and that there is a trade-off between high performance and taking care of ourselves. As countless studies show, this couldn\u0027t be less true.Comments (560)Devon CornealMother, writer, lawyerTo prepare him for the next chapter of his life, there are some things my littlest guy ought to know. If I could get him to sit still long enough to listen, this is what I\u0027d tell him.Comments (45)Will BunchAuthor, \u0027Tear Down This Myth\u0027While no one can reasonably claim that this Oklahoma tragedy has been ignored, there\u0027s one aspect of the killing that jumps off the page, and yet -- but for a couple of isolated exceptions -- has been all but banned as a topic for discussion.Comments (516)Katy GrayCreator, \u0027Still Here\u0027 magazineBeing sectioned and locked in a hospital ward wasn\u0027t on my bucket list, but it\u0027s something that has happened to me twice. The first time, I was 20 and in the middle of my studies at university. I had been hearing a voice for two years, a voice I believed was the devil.CommentsBill GeorgeProfessor of Management Practice, Harvard Business SchoolTo his credit, Ballmer invested heavily in R\u0026D, but Microsoft has little to show for it. Like many of its high tech counterparts, Microsoft has been unable to overcome the dominance of its core business.CommentsAndy BellattiRegistered dietitian; Creator of Small BitesWhile these healthful groups of people may appear to have widely different diets, there is one common thread: Their intake of processed foods, added sugars, trans fats, and artificial ingredients is minimal, if at all existent.Comments (73)Brittany GibbonsBlogger, \"Brittany, Herself\"The fact is, I am horrible at intimacy. I come from a family of non-huggers and I sometimes hate my body, so yeah, recipe for Temple Grandin hug machine. My husband is gorgeous and very, very sexy, but the issues we were having in the sack were all me.Comments (1,204)Doug BandowSenior Fellow, the Cato InstituteInstead of acting as the regime\u0027s enabler, the Obama administration should \"reset\" relations with Cairo. The U.S. should cut off all aid and withdraw America\u0027s ambassador. If Washington has any influence to exercise, it should do so quietly and informallyCommentsEllen HuertaEntrepreneur and Dream ChaserWasn\u0027t Google supposed to be the best place to work? Wasn\u0027t I supposed to cherish my six figure salary, free meals, massages, etc.? I did feel incredibly thankful, but I also felt like a jerk. The truth was I felt unfulfilled and I was scared to tell anyone.Comments (73)Carl PopeFormer executive director and chairman, Sierra ClubWe have been warned. The warnings are coming true. The costs are rising. Yet still we dither. What\u0027s going on?CommentsMatt WalshBlogger, talk radio host, father of twinsSome folks seem to get into a customer service Battle Royale every time they step outside their house. Maybe it\u0027s because the universe is against you guys. Or maybe -- just maybe -- it\u0027s because you behave like selfish obnoxious bullies.Comments (875)Ken ReedSports Policy Director, League of FansSitting around an outside table at a restaurant near our home, we were sharing news our youngest child didn\u0027t want to hear: Mom and Dad were not going to let her play soccer anymore.Comments (279)Laura BatesFounder of the Everyday Sexism Project\"I once worked in a company where I was the only female on a floor of men. They would look me up and down, laughing. They would bring in The Sun, put it on my desk open at Page 3 and ask if I looked like the topless woman pictured.\"Comments (47)Todd KestinLCSW, Life Skills MentorThere\u0027s more to preparing for adulthood than academic education. I believe if kids spent their summers in camp, they\u0027d be better prepared for later decisions like whether to go to college, and how to make the best life for who they are.Comments (28)Bill JanovitzSinger, Guitarist, SongwriterMany people have asked me how I decided to choose the 50 songs that make up my new book, Rocks Off: 50 Tracks That Tell the Story of the Rolling Stones.Comments (21)Jeffrey Rubin, Ph.D.Author, PsychotherapistThe willingness to explore with patience and empathy the actual experience of what people undergo, no matter how horrific, is indispensable in healing the emotional afflictions that haunt human beings.CommentsMichael KeeganPresident, People For the American Way and People For the American Way FoundationSo it is a reflection of social progress that so many conservative Republican lawmakers and right-wing leaders try to wrap themselves in the moral authority of the civil rights movement. But it\u0027s also a reflection of cynical political posturing.Comments (33)Jennipher WaltersCEO and co-founder, FitBottomedGirls.comAt the end of the day, the thing we\u0027re all searching for is to feel good. To feel empowered. For some, that feeling is bolstered by having muscles to flex. For others, that might mean just walking with her head high, knowing that she\u0027s taking care of herself in a way that feels good for her.Comments (97)Stephen SchlesingerAuthor and Fellow at the Century FoundationWith the Middle East descending into chaos in recent weeks, the last thing Washington needs to do is to insert American troops into this boiling cauldron.Comments (66)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistAs the child of a performer who was always on the go, I grew up on the road. My family would travel with my father from city to city, always staying in the best room of the hotel because he was the star performer. I was eight years old before I realized that every hotel room didn\u0027t come with a piano!CommentsRep. Marcia L. FudgeU.S. Representative from Ohio\u0027s 11th DistrictCongress should strengthen and protect vital anti-hunger programs like SNAP instead of making struggling families worry about where they will get their next meal.Comments (71)Larry StraussVeteran high school teacher and coach, writerMeasuring student learning isn\u0027t like measuring the vacancy rate of a motel -- or the gross sales of a retailer or productivity in a factory. In education, the infatuation with data tends to produce expedient and pedantic solutions to often complex challenges.Comments (16)Patric K. StantonProfessor of Cell Biology, Anatomy, and Neurology, New York Medical CollegeWhen should society (namely us) view this form of internal experience as a disease, instead of a rare, but acceptable, part of life?CommentsDaniel ClementMatrimonial LawyerSince a litigated divorce is mentally overwhelming, you could unwittingly fall victim to these behaviors which would ensure that you would only view your divorce with regrets. By simply being aware of what not to do, you can steer clear of these mistakes.Comments (61)Huff TV, 2013.23.08MutualArt, 2013.23.08Idealist, 2013.23.08Bob Cesca, 2013.23.08Chris Weigant, 2013.23.08Lorraine Devon Wilke, 2013.23.08Marian Wright Edelman, 2013.23.08Sally McGraw, 2013.23.08Tom Frieden, MD, MPH, 2013.23.08James Ehnes, 2013.23.08Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"EARLY INTEL POINTS TO ASSAD CHEMICAL WEAPONS USE",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
