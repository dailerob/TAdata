{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AriannaWhat to make of an agreement that preserves the filibuster while guaranteeing that it can only be used “under extraordinary circumstances”? Isn’t that like being told by the police that you can keep your car -- on the condition that you only drive it to get away from an erupting volcano? And you live in Nebraska. The real question is what will the Democrats do now? Social Security isn’t going private; the Senate isn’t going nuclear. Could it be that they can no longer avert their eyes from Iraq? As the Greek poet Cavafy famously asked: “What are we going to do without the barbarians? They were, after all, some kind of a solution.”05.24.2005 Christopher HitchensI still feel an affectionate interest in a young scribe at whose bar-mitzvah I danced. And I still, always, sue anyone who accuses me of bigotry or Holocaust-denial. Young master Blumenthal can relax: his attempted association was too lax and too cowardly. Anyone thinking of running with it, however, can check my website and view the correspondence with the lawyers of the last person who tried this: Mr Henry Kissinger.read whole post | permalink05.24.2005 Seth GreenlandLike President Clinton, Bill Maher is lucky in his enemies. Rep. Spencer Bachus (R. Ala.) has accused him of treason for pointing out in a colorful way (I loved the low-lying fruitpicking metaphor) that the armed forces are not meeting their recruiting goals. The frothing-at-the-mouth behavior of people like Rep. Bob Barr only made Clinton seem statemanlike in contrast. Similiarly, the fulminations of Spencer Bachus nudge Maher in the direction of Will Rogers.read whole post | permalink05.24.2005 Dal LaMagnaTwo stem cell bills may come up for a vote today in the House. One would create a national umbilical cord bank and provide federal funding for ongoing research into stem cell therapy; the other (HR 810) would allow federally funded researchers to use discarded embryos from fertility clinics to explore new stem cell lines. President Bush has said he would veto the latter.read whole post | permalink05.24.2005 Hilary RosenToday\u0027s victory doesn\u0027t belong to the Democrats, it belongs to the group of six - not seven (does Lindsay Graham get to be on every side of EVERY issue?)-- Republicans who led the deal on judges. It is a defeat for Leader Frist, but more important it is a defeat for Focus on the Family, the Family Research Council and every other self righteous, religious bully who has tried to own the Congress, the White House and our lives.read whole post | permalink05.24.2005 Sean DanielThe best interests of the Republic, the power of filmed entertainment and the ability of the Democrats to fight a better battle in the future all came together Monday evening in Washington DC. Sen. John McCain, under pressure to get to the premiere of his bio-pic Faith of My Fathers seems to have used his need to get to the screening on time to knock heads and get \"the gang of 14\" to hammer out their compromise.read whole post | permalink05.24.2005 Bruce FerberClick here to watch the video, \"The Misadventures of Lil Arnie, Part One\"read whole post | permalink05.24.2005 Tim RobbinsNow, after almost 1,600 Americans and 100,000 Iraqi civilians have died, after our actions have increased recruitment for terrorist groups worldwide and alienated our most trusted allies, now that our press finally reports what I and others read three years ago in the alternative press and British newspapers, now is the time for American artists to tell truth to power.read whole post | permalink05.24.2005 Geoffrey R.

Who won?read whole post | permalink05.24.2005 Andrei ChernyThis a clear victory for Democrats -- perhaps the party\u0027s most significant victory in the entire Bush era. At the 11th hour, the Republican leadership simply did not have the votes in the face of an American public that had seen through their power-hungry abuse of basic principles.read whole post | permalink05.24.2005 Paul FeigI was watching Dr. Frist\u0027s speech on the Senate floor regarding the compromise over judicial filibusters and had decided to create my own drinking game based around his usage of the term \"up or down vote.\" I am currently in the emergency room of St. Joseph\u0027s hospital in Burbank with alcohol poisoning. Please ask those on the Christian right to pray for me.permalink05.23.2005 Lizz WinsteadThe only science that may work to prevent kids from having sex may be reverse psychology. Maybe if you sit your kids down and say, “When I grab your mothers’ firm buttocks and mount her like a stallion, she screams for the whip and God do I make her beg for it!” After they’ve stopped throwing up, maybe they’ll vow never to have sex.read whole post | permalink05.24.2005 Paul RieckhoffPat Tillman was not character in a video game. He was not a piece on a chess board. He was a real person. And a damn good one. Just like every single one of our troops who has died. Even if you weren\u0027t a sports fan, you know his name now. Honor him by finding out the names of some others.read whole post | permalink05.23.2005 Richard CarlsonNatan Sharansky came by my office for lunch last week.

How come it’s always big corporations or the owners of gas-guzzling SUVs -- or impotent rapists -- who seem to catch a break?read whole post | permalink05.23.2005 Sandy FrankThe other day when British MP and alleged Oil-For-Food bribee George Galloway testified to a senate committee and generally cut our guys to ribbons, I was reminded of a question I’ve wondered about before: Are United States Senators as slow-witted as they appear?read whole post | permalink05.23.2005 Patt MorrisonThe news of advances in stem cell research in South Korea prompted immediate \"view with alarm\" remarks from the White House. \"I worry,\" quoth George W.

Perhaps we can agree on that, eh? Condi Rice, even better. By Washington standards they are gifted truth-spinners. But by Hollywood standards these guys are pikers.
