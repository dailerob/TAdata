{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Your dog\u0027s best friendWe\u0027ve now arrived at the era of \"feeding the base,\" telling the most likely voters what they\u0027ve told consultants they most want to hear -- the clanging echo chamber that passes for modern American political discourse. Just as advertisers\u0027 wishes have merged with (if not driven) technological change in the media universe, so in politics: speaking to the larger mass audience is a rare event, limited to special ceremonial occasions like inaugurations. The rest of the messaging is targeted, if not dog-whistled, to specific tranches of the desired constituency, sliced as finely as the mortgages (pre-2008) or the auto loans in modern financial \"securities.\"The Democratic Party has core values that are very much in sync with most Americans. But this year, too many Democratic candidates lost sight of those core principles -- opting instead to clip their progressive wings in deference to a conventional wisdom that says bold ideas aren\u0027t politically practical.109th Mayor of New York CityThe coalition that ran the Prop. 47 campaign shows that bipartisan partnership can work. The voters that passed it into law shows that the public is more than ready to finally end the prison crisis in our country by dramatically reducing incarceration and investing in the smart safety strategies our communities need.Executive Director of Californians for Safety and Justice and was Chair of the Proposition 47 ballot committeeFounder and Chairman of Serving California and was a major donor to the Prop. 47 campaignWhatever you call it, Race to the Top has hurt children, demoralized teachers, closed community schools, fragmented communities, increased privatization, and doubled down on testing. But I have an idea for a new accountability system that relies on different metrics.Research Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027We do not choose the work we were brought into this lifetime to do. That work is your soul signature -- your unique expression. Your spiritual DNA.Contemporary thought leader and spiritual teacherToday\u0027s an achievement for everyone who\u0027s held a banner, signed a petition, and gone to jail -- and a call for many more to join us going forward!Author of a dozen books, including \u0027The End of Nature\u0027 and \u0027Deep Economy\u0027The costs to cities, coastlines and crops, as well as to the health and livelihoods of thousands, are mounting. China and the United States show the necessary determination to build a future based on low emissions through clean energy and livable cities because it makes sense for the environment and economies.President, World Bank GroupAnti-imperialism has survived as a pillar of ideology, as has Sinocentrism and Russocentrism, which focus overwhelmingly on resistance to the United States and its allies.Professor of Sociology, Princeton University and editor of The Asan ForumI follow the Sikh faith, which requires that I keep my hair long and wear a turban and beard. The ROTC recruiters said I would not be able to enlist unless I complied with all Army grooming and uniform rules.Student, Hofstra UniversitySo much has changed in recent decades -- the influx of women into the workforce, modernizing gender roles, new family structures -- and it makes no sense that our laws haven\u0027t kept up with social and economic change. In the second decade of the 21st century, why are we still living by Leave it to Beaver rules?U.S. Secretary of LaborDemocrats have historically been the party of Social Security and the champion of the middle class -- so what happened?Founding Co-director, Social Security WorksProfessor of Social Work, Syracuse UniversityRalph, for whatever reason, your vicious, personal caricature of Hillary Clinton has trashed a great friend of the consumer movement. Don\u0027t compound the error you made in 2000.Chairman of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety CommissionThe real problem in Ferguson is the fact that the residents are stuck with a police department that seemingly lacks ethnic diversity, appears racially insensitive and is unwilling to admit changes within are necessary. The problems of the Ferguson Police Department are cultural and systemic.Speaker, Police Expert \u0026 Community AdvocateThe goal of making Election Day a national holiday is not only to make it easier for people to vote, but to increase attention on the need for us to move toward a vibrant democracy.Independent U.S. Senator from VermontNow is the time to continue to take swift, commonsense action to protect the public from Ebola and other infectious diseases. But first we must address another contagion spreading across the country. We must confront the epidemic of fear.35th president of the American Nurses Association (ANA), which represents the nation’s 3.1 million registered nurses.Obama needs to strongly show that no election instantly changes what the two parties believe, and that all this talk of waving red flags cuts both ways.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comWhen one party has made explicit that its primary goal is to block nearly anything proposed by a sitting president and, further, to undo substantive achievements to date -- when revenge requires all Republican senators and representatives to adhere to that primary goal -- then seeking agreement is seen as a contradiction.Professor Emerita, USC Marshall School; Author, \u0027The Secret Handshake\u0027 and \u0027Shadow Campus\u0027The question is whether President Obama can advance his foreign policy aims -- expanding trade, increasing military cooperation, keeping China at bay -- and honor the rest of that 2009 inaugural address?Former speechwriter at the U.S. Department of StateJune 21, 1964, went from a day of hope to a night of terror and fear as three civil rights workers from CORE were shot dead by a mob of Klansmen and law enforcement on the narrow Rock Cut Road outside Philadelphia, Mississippi, in sparsely populated Neshoba County.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityIronically, many if not most of the issues rural and urban folks care about are the same: good jobs, economic growth, a sound environment, and access to decent and affordable health care. But the urban/rural divide has become a steep one over the past two decades and it is often overlooked.Senior Fellow at the Bipartisan Policy CenterI am a Democrat. My small \"d\" democratic bent encourages me to try to see the best in people, even politicians from the opposing party. But I have rarely witnessed the kind of bare-knuckled politicking that occurred during these mid-term elections.Freelance writerTrying to attach meaning to depression and anxiety is like trying to attach a tail to an invisible donkey.Daddy blogger at \"No Idea What I\u0027m Doing: A Daddy Blog\"We have moved towards an economy that can simultaneously benefit some enormously and destroy unusually large numbers of others.Professor, Columbia University; Author, \u0027Expulsions: Brutality and Complexity in the Global Economy\u0027No one strategy can combat climate change and divestment is no exception. But as the U.S. and China just demonstrated, the possibility of failure isn\u0027t an excuse for inaction.Co-founder and Communications Director, 350.orgI have had the privilege and pleasure of representing some amazing people over the last 21 years who just could not make it work. Some really hardworking, big-hearted, intelligent, successful and beautiful people (inside and out) have been my clients.AttorneySometimes the lies are to our patients. Sometimes, the lies are to our families. And sometimes the lies are to ourselves. But, nonetheless, we lie. A lot. Often daily. Want an inside scoop on the lies to look out for from your doctor?Surgeon. Author. Speaker. Coach. Creator of lovemedicineagain.com. On a path to remind us why we chose medicine in the first place.You\u0027ve got two choices: You can advocate for the rich or for the poor. But if you happen to be Christian, it important to factor Jesus into your answer.Author; Editor; Speaker; ActivistThere are two ironclad requisites for a federal prosecution of a police officer for the criminal use of deadly force. One is that there has to be solid proof that the officer acted either with racial animus or with reckless intent to cause malice to an individual. The other requisite is there has to be a compelling interest.Author and political analystUnlike the crystal-clear mobile connection in the famous Verizon ad, it seems the phone line between politicians and the American public is broken. As Election Day exit polls showed, voters are more frustrated, more disappointed, and more discouraged than ever.Political strategistTo spend more of our time trying to push people back to buying records is an exercise in futility. The smart ones will find a different way. Spotify could be that way, and if it isn\u0027t, it can definitely help transition us into a world where streaming is key, and CDs are just plastic circles.Brooklyn-based, indie-pop artistThe operations may well be in violation of federal statutes prohibiting deceptive marketing and unwanted telephone sales calls, as well as DOE laws and regulations barring payment of sales commissions to college recruiters. At the very least, they are guilty of using sleazy tactics to sell poor-quality products.Attorney, advocate, writer at RepublicReport.orgGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"NEXT WEEK?",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
