{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Happy 4th of July weekend! The week leading up to the holiday gave us much to celebrate -- and much not to celebrate. We can certainly rejoice that Hurricane Arthur failed to do much damage before weakening and heading out to sea. But there can only be consternation at the Supreme Court\u0027s decision to allow some corporations to withhold birth control coverage -- damage reports to follow in the years to come. We can also celebrate that the latest jobs numbers showed the economy added 288,000 jobs in June. Far less worthy of fireworks is the fact that wage growth still lags in this unequal recovery. And though there were ugly anti-immigration protests in Southern California, we can celebrate that most Americans realize it\u0027s our shared history as a nation of immigrants that defines us.So while a business corporation can\u0027t go to church, fast on Yom Kippur, or travel to Mecca for Ramadan, it can still go to court and, on the basis of religious freedom, demand to be exempted from the law that applies to everyone else. Today, women are the victim. Tomorrow, it could be LGBT people. Indeed, after Hobby Lobby, every person is at risk. Everyone, that is, except the corporate person, my friend.Professor of Law, UCLAAs we are all surely aware, we now face the most ominous decisions in human history. There are many problems that must be addressed, but two are overwhelming in their significance: environmental destruction and nuclear war.Institute Professor emeritus, MIT Department of Linguistics and PhilosophyCommon Core testing will turn out to be the money pit that consumed American education. The sooner it dies, the sooner schools and teachers will be freed of the Giant Federal Accountability Plan hatched in secret and foisted upon our nation\u0027s schools.Research Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u00272014 has been the year when the discussion of well-being has migrated from health and wellness magazines to business magazines. Wellness, and how to integrate it into our work lives, has become the hottest topic in the business pages. And that should come as no surprise.You would think by listening to some on Capitol Hill that doing anything about climate change, will end life, as we know it. In fact, it\u0027s precisely the opposite. All of this has become a big fat political football where self-preservation is the priority over the national good.Actor, director and environmental activistIgnored by our current education policies are the facts that one in four American children lives below the poverty line and a growing number are homeless, without regular access to food or health care, and stressed by violence and drug abuse around them. Educators now spend a great deal of their time trying to help children and families in their care manage these issues, while they also seek to close skill gaps and promote learning.Charles E. Ducommun Professor of Education at Stanford UniversityTwo things are absolutely clear about this Supreme Court term. One, it\u0027s once again been a very good term for the Chamber of Commerce. And, two, it\u0027s been an even better one for the business community writ large.Founder and President, Constitutional Accountability CenterReal leadership means being prepared not to get involved. Real leadership means not being flattered into war by other states proclaiming America\u0027s indispensability in solving their problems. Real leadership means allowing, indeed, expecting, others to take control of their own destinies. Foreign policy is a difficult business.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteOn this final day of the term, the Supreme Court will be handing down a decision with potentially broad implications not only for the rights of women and workers, but also for corporate personhood and religious liberty.Chief Counsel, Constitutional Accountability CenterOn this July 4 we should dedicate ourselves to recovering the American promise that education should increase our independence. Since the founding of this country, education has been closely tied to self-reliance, to declaring one\u0027s independence through one\u0027s ability to think for oneself and creatively contribute to society.President, Wesleyan UniversityThis month California is celebrating the 10th anniversary of its first-in-the-nation Paid Family Leave (PFL) program, which has helped more than 1.5 million parents. But despite the track record, too few parents are taking advantage of the program, and those parents who may need it most are least likely to sign up.Award-winning journalist, bestselling author and activistThe days when Big Business can have it both ways -- as an artificial, power-concentrating entity with special privileges and immunities, on the one hand, and all the constitutional human rights of real people on the other hand, are coming to an end.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorOur constant rhetoric -- particularly from Washington -- asserts that we have made progress since the colonialism of King Leopold in the Congo. International criminal justice and human rights are pursued with relish, are they not? Not according to the example of Richard Bruce Cheney.Colonel, U.S. Army (Retired)Last week, at the invitation of my friend Muhammad Yunus, I traveled to Bangladesh, a truly humbling and inspiring experience. I met so many incredible people struggling to improve their country and their lives.President, Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human RightsMillions of years ago, our brains became wired to remember about 150 people as \"close friends\". This is probably because early hominid tribes gathered in communities of that size. Today, this explains why an infantry company organizes around that size, and why smaller companies do better per-person than larger ones.Chairman/CEO, XPRIZEListener bias results in most people thinking that women are hogging the floor when men are actually dominating.Feminist, Writer, Satirist... not always in that orderConservatives who claim to be on the side of freedom while ignoring the growing imbalance of economic and political power in America are not in fact on the side of freedom. They are on the side of those with the power.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Two or three decades from now, the twentysomethings of Tahrir Square or the Casbah in Tunis or Martyrs\u0027 Square in Tripoli will, like the Havels of the Middle East, come to power as politicians. In the meantime, here are three of their achievements that seem likely to be lasting, whatever the upheaval in the region.Professor of Modern Middle East and South Asian History, University of MichiganWhat we need this Independence Day is to take aim at that \"long train of abuses and usurpations\" visited on us by monied interests. Parade, picket and protest wherever figures of power and authority gather to plan new devices of enrichment for the few at the expense of the many.Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyManaging Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyHistory is divided on whether adding sex discrimination to the list of no-nos in the 1964 Civil Rights Act was meant to be a joke or a death knell for the bill. Either way, with women still making 77 cents on the dollar compared to men and the courts now firmly on the side of corporations, the joke is on women now.Money Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsWouldn\u0027t it be useful if public investment could provide decent jobs for people who\u0027d rather not work in mines, and reclaim ruined landscapes and rivers along the way?Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027I believe that by moving culture, you create space for politicians to enact policy; sometimes good and sometimes not so good. In this case, we know that the work of these artists will only uplift this nation for the better.Founder, GlobalGrind.comMichael Patrick MacDonald is a storyteller. Michael recently encouraged the crowd of young leaders at the Children\u0027s Defense Fund Freedom Schools\u0027 National Training to understand the power of storytelling to create change.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundJust when we thought the rights of women, workers and minorities faced enough setbacks, it appears the nation\u0027s highest court has done it once again. The Supreme Court\u0027s majority has very clearly shown where its interests are -- and they are not with the people.President, National Action NetworkEverything about our wedding was perfect to me. It was a beautiful, magical day -- and I never, ever, ever want to do it again.Lifestyle Blog Editor, The Huffington PostMany conservative Republicans have more or less admitted that those feelings are very present in the constituencies they represent. And the Republican leadership is unwilling to stand up to their fear of a more diverse American future.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersThe violence we experience throughout culture exists because we are literally crashing against boundaries of our own creation. An inept form of education, a complete lack of equality in nearly every sector of society, literal and figurative wars against ... terror, cancer, drugs, poverty.Leader of Change Our Story, composer, authorSo you\u0027ve decided to breastfeed. Fantastic! Breastfeeding is a wonderful way to nourish your baby while establishing early bonding. Unfortunately, breast milk comes out of breasts so there are a few ground rules that we need to cover.Author, The Honest Toddler: A Child\u0027s Guide to LifeAre people who do physically demanding, not-afraid-to-get-dirty jobs like farming, mining and sheep castration (yes, you read that right) the happiest people on earth? So says Mike Rowe, host of the Discovery Channel\u0027s \"Dirty Jobs.\" See if he changes your mind about what it means to be happy at work.\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"Presumably I, as a fat woman, would not know how to properly operate the complicated piece of equipment known as a bikini. What if I became distracted by the complexity of spandex, a substance heretofore unknown to me, and wandered blindly into traffic? What if I ate it?Writer, bloggerGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"NEW FRONT IN VOTING RIGHTS FIGHT",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
