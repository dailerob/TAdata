{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOMust have been quite the holiday party at the vice president\u0027s house this week: old chums Dick Cheney and Karl Rove tossing back a few eggnogs and talking about the possibility of a preemptive presidential pardon. Or evaluating the first steps of the Bush Legacy Project. No doubt there was a lot of backslapping when Fox\u0027s Chris Wallace stopped by. Earlier in the week, Wallace had vociferously defended Bush against criticisms leveled by Frost/Nixon filmmaker Ron Howard at a screening of the film. At the VP\u0027s party, a \"genuinely grateful\" Cheney thanked Wallace for standing up for the president and promised him \"a special exit interview\" in a couple of weeks. Should be very fair and balanced. In other holiday party news: the Treasury Department holiday bash will be held in the department\u0027s \"Cash Room.\" Emptiest room in the place, I suppose.Read Post | CommentsBIOQueen Noor of Jordan, 12.04.2008I observed first hand her commitment to peace and justice, when my late husband and I worked closely with the Clintons in an attempt to achieve a Middle East peace.

Is this not news?Read Post | Comments (148)BIODeepak Chopra, 12.03.2008To trivialize my views on a topic as vast of of terrorism with \"Deepak Blames America,\" as Ms. Rabinowitz has done, not only suggests how abysmally uninformed she is, but also speaks to the ever-sinking journalistic standards of her newspaper.Read Post | Comments (222)BIOArianna Huffington, 12.04.2008Did I think Ed Rendell\u0027s comment was sexist? I didn\u0027t. But I do think it is emblematic of a pervasive misperception in America: the idea that to be a success you have to drive yourself into the ground.Read Post | Comments (170)BIOBonnie Fuller, 12.05.2008It\u0027s time to hold another pity party for poor , sad Jen.
