{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Michael VlahosWriter and National Security expertWhy do the photos, video, and tweets out of Kiev have such mythic power? Why do demonstrations, and barricades, and people shot down, young and old, men and women alike, wring such enduring emotion (like Les Miserables)? Why do citizen risings in big, capital cities have such a hold on us? For a start, citizen-risings in cities are not war. Even when there is lots of fighting, it is never a fair fight, and we are rooting for the underdog, where the force against them is always unfairly superior, professional, and heavily armed. Plus a group of poorly armed citizens are unlike an army in almost every way. But especially this way -- Together, they are the whole community: Men, women, and children fighting together. Their backs are against the family hearth itself. Nothing could be more existential, or more motivating.CommentsLinda StoneWriter, speaker and consultantWhat if I told you that the way we are talking about attention is part of the problem? Our conversation about distraction, multitasking, and the stern command to focus, actually creates a level of stress, anxiety, and shame.CommentsRev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkIt\u0027s sometimes hard to believe that the year is 2014. For all of our advances, tech developments, innovations, achievements and progress, we are watching elected officials enact laws and propose others that are simply unbelievable.CommentsNoah MichelsonExecutive Editor, HuffPost Gay VoicesAfter reading your stunningly bratty \"as told to\" New York Magazine tirade where you threatened to leave behind public life because you\u0027ve been so maligned by the queer community, there are a few things I want you to know.Comments (62)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027While CBO didn\u0027t explore this issue, other things equal, a reduction in the supply of labor would be expected to lead to a rise in its price. In other words, wages would rise. That would be good news for workers who have seen their wages stagnate for more than three decades.CommentsKristin Kirkpatrick, M.S., R.D., L.D.Manager of Wellness Nutrition Services at Cleveland Clinic Wellness InstituteI\u0027m happy to keep my \"non-fun\" mom status if that means that I can help my son be a healthy eater and maintain a normal weight throughout his life. One day he\u0027ll pass the same habits down to his kids and perhaps then he\u0027ll realize just how \"fun\" being healthy, staying fit and avoiding sickness can really be.CommentsWill BunchAuthor, \u0027Tear Down This Myth\u0027The minimum wage is just one of many policy debates in America in which policy initiatives that would help large numbers of citizens -- at the expense of the few -- are casually dismissed as simply not worth it.Comments (70)Chris KluweNFL player, Minnesota VikingsWhat have I learned about the guiding principle of politically free sport, bringing nations together in peace and harmony under the benevolent hand of the IOC? I\u0027ve learned there is a problem with Sochi.CommentsBill MoyersManaging Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyEveryone knows about the military-industrial complex, which, in his farewell address, President Eisenhower warned had the potential to \"endanger our liberties or democratic process\" but have you heard of the \"Deep State?\"CommentsMattan GriffelCEO at One Month Rails, growth hacker, online learning expertNothing drives people crazier than an email where someone sends over a lot of information but doesn\u0027t say what they\u0027d like you to do. I often respond to those immediately by asking: What do you want me to do?CommentsSigmund Freud and Michael RothAn event at New York\u0027s Jewish Museum has been cancelled because Judith Butler\u0027s politics are just too controversial. What a sad commentary on the Jewish community\u0027s tolerance for debate these days!CommentsTamara Shayne KagelWriter, Lawyer, Dancer, BloggerMost of us want to be appreciated and loved and valued for more than how we look, but are unable to completely expunge all interest in our outward image. If this is where most of us live, shouldn\u0027t we be asking for acceptance to be in this middle space?CommentsRobert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The agenda of global finance, carried out via \"trade\" deals, has diverted attention from the real economic issues -- rising inequality and insecurity for ordinary people, the use of globalization as a battering ram to empower capital and weaken labor, and to prevent government interventions from averting financial speculation and collapse.Comments (43)Marty KaplanUSC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorThese coming 15 years of negotiation and enforcement are arguably the most important 15 years in human history. If we want to have a meaningful agreement in place for 2020, a plan that the U.S., Russia, China, India and the rest of the developed and developing world will commit to, and that will actually move us back from the brink, we better move our global ass.CommentsMary BottariCenter for Media and Democracy, ALECexposed.org and PRWatch.orgWalker has said repeatedly that while he was Milwaukee County Executive he had a clear policy against doing campaign work on the public dime, something that had repeatedly landed other state leaders in jail.Comments (42)Daphne EviatarSenior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstPresident Obama was right when he said \"democracy demands\" that all wars must end. Last month, he reaffirmed he wants to move America \"off a permanent war footing\" in his State of the Union address. Now is the time for senior Pentagon officials to explain the steps they\u0027ll take to get us there.CommentsPaul Brandeis RaushenbushExecutive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostBills that encourage communities to rip apart the fabric of America should be seen for what they are: discriminatory and deeply un-American. That is my sincerely held religious belief.Comments (79)Dean SluyterMeditation teacher, authorHarold Ramis, the wonderful comic writer-director, has died at age 69. He made us laugh, which is gift enough in this world. That his films, like Caddyshack and Ghostbusters, usually succeeded in being funny while maintaining a gentle and generous spirit made the gift even richer.CommentsIdris ElbaActorTo be a Mandela is to understand the longings of the South African people. That is the first thing I learned when I set out to portray Nelson Mandela, the new nation\u0027s founding leader and inspirational visionary, in Mandela: Long Walk To Freedom.CommentsReza MarashiResearch Director, National Iranian American CouncilUnlike the fast-paced, edge-of-your seat diplomacy that secured an interim deal in Geneva, slow and steady will win the race to a final deal in Vienna. With a Gordian knot of technical problems and political differences to cut through, both sides are ready for the long haul.CommentsAdam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911Just remember that it all comes down to money: yours (that the criminals want), and the cold hard cash that some corporations and institutions haven\u0027t spent to keep your information secure.CommentsCara PaiukAuthor, mother, and entrepreneurWhen thinking about having a child, buying a home or going on a dream vacation, it will never seem like it\u0027s the right time or you have enough money. You just have to take the leap and do it!Comments (16)Rainn WilsonActorThis year my wife and I have started a new nonprofit venture. It\u0027s called LIDE, and it\u0027s an educational initiative in Haiti using the arts to empower adolescent girls and create community. Let me tell you a little bit about it.CommentsWray HerbertAuthor, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027Psychological theory supports the idea that conservatives, if threatened, will circle the ideological wagons, embracing rather than moving away from conservative values. Craig and Richeson decided to see if the likelihood of an increasingly diverse racial landscape influences the politics of white Americans, and if so, how.CommentsMichael BrennerSenior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghThere are more reasons for Americans to feel aggrieved today than at any time since the Vietnam War ended nearly 40 years ago. At no time before or since has there been so little effort to remedy those conditions. That contradiction should be our main grievance.CommentsThomas Wilner and Thomas P. SullivanDuring his first year in office, the president formed an interagency panel of top security and law enforcement experts to review every detainee at Guantanamo and cleared more than half of the detainees for release. Yet, most remain imprisoned.CommentsMarianne Szegedy-MaszakJournalist; Author, \"I Kiss Your Hands Many Times: Hearts, Souls, and Wars in Hungary\"In the 1920s, when my mother was still a child, the family, like many members of the Hungarian Jewish aristocracy, converted to Christianity, some out of conviction, others out of an eagerness to demonstrate their nationalistic loyalties..CommentsDoug BandowSenior Fellow, the Cato InstituteThe mass killing of elephants is tragic. But demand for new ivory, not items legally imported decades or centuries ago, fuels the trade. Governments should penalize poachers and their seller allies -- not responsible collectors and dealers who have followed the rules.CommentsEvelyn LeopoldVeteran journalist reporting from the United NationsBad publicity during the Sochi games was not the sole reason Russia, Syria\u0027s main ally, supported the resolution, diplomats said. Some speculated that Moscow was not pleased with the Damascus\u0027 government\u0027s stalling in the collapsed Geneva peace talks.CommentsWendell PotterAuthor, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgA new study in Massachusetts is providing evidence that the reform law passed in that state in 2006, and which served as the model for the Affordable Care Act, is indeed making a significant dent in bankruptcy filings.CommentsLaura W. MurphyDirector, ACLU Washington Legislative OfficeYou\u0027ve spoken against the humiliating practice of racial profiling many times since then. So why does your administration continue to discriminate against Americans because of the color of their skin or the way they dress?CommentsDean Baker, 2014.24.02Paul Abrams, 2014.24.02Scott Anderson, 2014.24.02Gur Tsabar, 2014.24.02Zaki Hasan, 2014.24.02Turnstyle, 2014.24.02Jason Wahler, 2014.24.02Jackie K.
