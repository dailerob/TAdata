{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor of international relations, George Washington UniversityIn recent days, the commentariat has made much out of the fact that news about Hillary Clinton\u0027s use of a private email server has drowned out the policy proposals she has unveiled. These proposals indeed deserve public attention. However, they also reveal one of her campaign\u0027s great weaknesses: its tendency to treat the public as if it were a conglomerate of special interest groups. To be fair, Americans have interests and tend to favor elected officials who promise to address their particular concerns. However, we do not live by bread alone. We are also citizens of a country that most of us sense is increasingly headed in the wrong direction. We seek a leader who will share with us a vision of an America of which we can be proud, a narrative of what went wrong, and how we can make America whole again. Democrats need their own version of Reagan: someone with simple, straightforward, and compelling vision.Petteri Lahtela is the CEO and co-founder of OURA, a wearable device -- in the form of a waterproof ring -- that measures our well-being as we sleep. In answer to my questions, he shared his insights on the restorative power of sleep, the future of sleep technology, and how wearable devices can enhance the body-mind connection.Data breaches have become the third certainty in life, right behind death and taxes. Up to now, the kind of information most often exposed in a breach was of concern because it could be used to harm our financial lives and even our well being (like medical identity theft). What differentiates the ALM hack is that it has moral ramifications.Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and IDT911While Kasich and Bush certainly took a more measured tone in the first Republican debate compared to, say, Donald Trump, their policy positions and records as governor in Ohio and Florida show that they\u0027re just as extreme and far-right as the rest of the Republican field.Political Director, People For the American WayIt\u0027s possible that billions of years ago, tiny bits of biology quit the Red Planet and infected ours. If so, your family tree -- and that of every other terrestrial life form -- has its deepest roots not in the ancient oceans of Earth, but in the vanished seas of Mars.Senior Astronomer, SETI InstituteStay-at-home mom is not a real job. At most places of employment, when you take lunch, you\u0027re actually allowed to feed yourself, not spend lunchtime preparing a meal for your boss, cutting it into painstakingly small pieces, while he screams at you for not moving faster.Wife, mom, avid sports fanFar from offering a bold new immigration reform plan that would \"make America great again,\" Trump\u0027s plan recycles anti-immigrant ideas that were resoundingly defeated 150 years ago.Chief Counsel, Constitutional Accountability CenterOur policies toward prescription drugs not only violate Mill\u0027s freedom principle, they are also absurdly irrational. Pharmaceutical companies are permitted to advertise their prescription drugs to clients who are not legally permitted to freely purchase them.Professor of Economics at American University in Washington, DC.After a dozen years as administrator of the Pulitzer Prizes and many years as a journalist and professor, I retired last August into a life of creative dabbling on the Upper West Side. Then, the renowned American Museum of Natural History began to misbehave.Retired administrator of the Pulitzer PrizesMy socioeconomic background (and the teen mom status and high school level of education that came with it) was always lingering in the back of my mind, making me feel very inadequate. But it also made me work even harder to keep up and grow as much as I possibly could.Hyper, busy mom and runnerThe Black Lives Matter protest was disruptive, loud, tense and passionate. The first thing that came to my mind was ACT UP, a group I was a part of, which engaged in similar kinds of protest and disruption, including against Democratic presidential candidates. The urgency of the protest was similar as well: People are dying, and no one in power seems to be doing anything to stop it.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostAmerica would, for once, get two candidates who refused to put on their party\u0027s usual muzzle.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comI\u0027m not arguing that what the Fat Jew has been accused of doing isn\u0027t wrong. Plagiarism is never okay. However, to those who say he is a talentless hack, you\u0027re only half right. So if you\u0027re looking to go after someone who is solely profiting off the ideas of others, take your pitchforks elsewhere.Associate Social Media Editor, The Huffington PostPresidential candidate Donald Trump announced this week that he wants to abolish \"Birthright Citizenship.\" Naturally, the other lemmings in the race -- who seem anxious to follow him over the cliff -- promptly announced their agreement with the idea.Author, Attorney, and BooksellerThis liberal infighting isn\u0027t only about competing allegiances. It\u0027s about values, communication style, regulating Wall Street, a debate over Clinton\u0027s aggressive foreign policy and Bernie\u0027s recent Congressional Award from the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the future of the Democratic Party.Columnist published in The Cleveland Plain Dealer, The Baltimore Sun, The Hill, Salon, The Jerusalem Post www.hagoodman.comIt\u0027s a term I\u0027ve always loathed, and one that\u0027s dogged just about every working mother I know, for decades. The stunningly naïve belief that once we women had The Vote, The Pill, No-Fault Divorce and Equal Pay, that we could now go about the business of having The Job, The Marriage, The Kids, The Home we wanted, and -- some sanity.Editor-at-large, HuffPost Australia, and host of TodayMarco Rubio Decks a Kid with a Football; Lindsey Graham Wants to Pound Iraq; Ex-Gay Porn Star Says Demons Come Out of the Butt; Duggars Pitch a New Show; Hillary versus Black Lives Matter; and much more.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027If two people\u0027s actions cause someone to revoke their support of the #BlackLivesMatter movement, it begs the question of whether their support was ever there to begin with. Black lives matter all the time. They don\u0027t just matter when it\u0027s convenient, easy, or popular.President, Alaska, Oregon, Washington State Area Conference of the NAACP; President, Seattle King County NAACPCommunications Chair, Seattle King County NAACPI don\u0027t know if I broke a law of computing or committed heresy. But I installed Windows 10 on my Macbook Pro. I had feared that this would condemn me to purgatory in the gates of computing hell. But it has been an incredibly positive experience.Academic, Researcher, Writer, EntrepreneurThe word pandemic brings to mind an infectious disease that spreads through the world\u0027s population causing a global health crisis. So I found it interesting to see that many scientists are now using the term to describe obesity.Data guyAbove all, we must recognize the people who took the largest risks -- those who applied medical science, demonstrated safe health practices, and engaged in community outreach all while losing close relatives and friends to the disease.Vice President for Humanitarian Policy and Practice, InterActionInterestingly enough, social science research shows that the gaps between scientists and the general public cannot be spanned by logic and rational thought alone. While necessary, they are not sufficient by themselves.Adjunct Professor, UC BerkeleyNearly every other consumer product sold in America has passed basic safety regulations well in advance of reaching store shelves, so why don\u0027t business owners deserve the same protection when looking for a loan?Head of Policy \u0026 Advocacy at Fundera.com, Former Senior Economic Policy Advisor in the Obama White House and Small Business AdministrationAmong the U.S. lobbyists for Turkey, perhaps the most questionable is Porter Goss, CIA Director from 2004 to 2006, who has agreed to sell his soul and possibly U.S. national secrets for a fistful of Turkish Liras.Publisher of The California CourierThe European Union looks impressive but remains hollow. It exalts process over substance. Three presidents struggle for authority and attention. The European Commission has no popular legitimacy. The European Parliament is elected but most people use their vote as a protest against their home government.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteIf he was pro-life, wouldn\u0027t he oppose corporate polluters who release toxins into the air that annually sicken or kill hundreds of thousands of people in this country, including a disproportionate number of children and the elderly?Professor of Journalism, University of Indiana-IndianapolisWe\u0027ve all been in that situation where you just want to light up the dance floor with a domestic beer in hand, but end up lurking in the shadows because you aren\u0027t quite sure (or drunk enough to know) how to dance to \"Sherry\" by the Four Seasons.Author, IllustratorOur world is becoming a more dangerous place. Crises are intensifying. And the people who are most poor and vulnerable are always left suffering the consequences. That is what we must remember as we mark World Humanitarian Day this year.Executive Director, Oxfam InternationalSinking the agreement would not mean a return to the status quo, but the collapse of the international sanctions regime UANI has done so much to build, and which has induced Iran to make these historic concessions.Author, \u0027Gates of Injustice: The Crisis in America’s Prisons\u0027Our beliefs condition how we select data from reality, and can lead us to ignore \"inconvenient\" facts altogether. Soon we are using self-sealing reasoning, closing ourselves up to any challenge and adopting the arrogant attitude of the knower.Founder and Chairman, Conscious Business Center InternationalGiven Coke\u0027s own standards, it is appropriate to ask: Are the company\u0027s actions that have prompted such sharp public criticism in line with its strong commitment to integrity? More specifically, are they consistent with Coke\u0027s imperative of \"acting honestly\"?Day Family Senior Lecturer of Business Ethics, Johnson at Cornell; Adjunct Professor, Syracuse UniversityGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
