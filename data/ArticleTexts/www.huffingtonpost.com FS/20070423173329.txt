{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"APAsked by Charlie Rose his thoughts on the tragedy at Virginia Tech, Tom DeLay offered a jaw-dropping solution to avoiding future campus carnage: allow students to bring concealed weapons to class with them. Yep, the answer to gun violence is... more guns! For DeLay and his fellow gun lovers, the Second Amendment guarantees not only a well-regulated militia, but a well-armed student body. It brings a whole new dimension to school supplies. Ruler? Check. Protractor? Check? Glock 9? Check. Target practice will be a freshman prerequisite. It\u0027s Mutually Assured Destruction Goes to College. Animal House meets Death Wish. Shootout at the O.K. Dorm. Do we really want our institutions of higher learning to become ivy-covered versions of the Wild West? Haven\u0027t DeLay and company ever watched Deadwood?READ POST | comments (278)04.22.2007 Norman LearI called the barber in question, who has been my barber for 40 years.

We filmed in Vegas, had a blast, but my thoughts are concerned with poker and not cinema. Television has ruined the home game.READ POST04.22.2007 Laurie David and Sheryl CrowDrama aside, you would expect as an American citizen to be able to engage in a civil discussion with a public official. Instead, Mr. Rove was dismissive, condescending, and quite frankly a bully.READ POST | comments (531)04.23.2007 Joan Z.
