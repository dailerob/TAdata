{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor of Law, UCLAThe fatal shooting of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old African American, by a white police officer has sparked protests and outrage in the small town of Ferguson, Missouri. It has also touched off debates throughout the United States on racial harassment by the police and the increasing militarization of ordinary law enforcement after 9/11. Those conversations are important ones for Americans to have. Lost in the discussion, however, has been the role guns played in creating the environment of hostility between police and communities like Ferguson.Missouri is America, and like the nation itself, both racial strife and promise, are part of its enduring legacy. Long before black teenager Michael Brown, died tragically in a hail of police bullets, the dramatic epicenter of America\u0027s racial fault lines often emerged in Missouri.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityAs responsible citizens we must demand that our government exercise all influence to bring the Israeli government to honest, productive negotiations with the Palestinian unity government, to achieve lasting justice upon which an enduring peace, security, and prosperity can be achieved by all.Actor, producer and humanitarianNo wonder Americans feel powerless. No surprise we\u0027re sick of politics, and many of us aren\u0027t even voting. But if we give up on politics, we\u0027re done for. Powerlessness is a self-fulfilling prophesy.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027What is happening that so many people make this irrevocable choice? What are we missing in our culture? How can we open up the conversation on this issue to make other choices seem more realistic and appealing?Both explicit and implicit biases lead far too often to the killing of black men in police-civilian encounters. And they undergird the daily indignity and humiliation experienced by blacks who are stopped, questioned, and searched by police when they have done nothing wrong.Staff attorney for the ACLU’s Racial Justice ProgramWith the nation\u0027s outrage in full view, I believe that this case gives an outlet to a rising sense of power felt by parents and youth alike to call into question the behavior exhibited by those who are sworn to protect and serve all citizens.Senior Pastor, Potter\u0027s House, TexasHow, in the modern age, can a state put on such sham proceedings, open to the world, and get away with it?Lawyer, activist and authorIt\u0027s bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb bomb if not (yet) Iran... then Iraq, or Pakistan, or Libya, or Yemen, or (insert intransigent foreign country/peoples here). And like cults everywhere, it\u0027s best not to question the core belief and practices of its leaders -- after all, bombs bursting in air is now as American as the \"Star Spangled Banner.\"Writer, Professor, Retired Lt. Colonel, Air ForceAs I watched with a sickening sense of deja vu the images coming out of Ferguson, MO this week, I couldn\u0027t help but come to this conclusion: we have allowed a pernicious historical revisionism to undermine the legacy of the civil rights movement.Host, \u0027Dan Rather Presents\u0027The number of times that Sen. McCain hasn\u0027t just been wrong, but deadly wrong, on matters of our security is nearly impossible to count. Maybe the DC fishbowl has convinced itself that McCain has been prescient. Well, I\u0027m here to give them a quick education, because many of us who have served in the these conflicts are less convinced.Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranWhen a black person is killed in America, trolls come out of the woodwork in an attempt to justify or distract from the taking of that life.Poet, author, and activistThere is one arena in which misleading the public not only is abided but is the norm: politics. In fact, much of what constitutes political discourse in this country is now built on a foundation of dishonesty.Author, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgThe death of two parents spread over such a chasm of time reassures me that I have grown up. had feared the brutal spectacle and harsh rattle of death. I had feared being alone with her at the final judgmental moment of leaving, feared I would abandon her and not offer a last comfort, that split second of reassurance as she left. Yet none of those fears came true.Vice President, Chandris HotelsWhile our health planning mechanisms are likely to keep Ebola from our shores, we cannot avoid our role in the larger, global fight.Director, Center on Congress at Indiana UniversityDespite significant progress allowing tens of millions of children to enroll into school at the start of the millennium, a recent estimate suggested that at the current rate we must wait until 2086 for the last girl to have a primary education in Africa.Co-Founder, A World at School; Executive Chair, Global Business Coalition for EducationSure, it\u0027s great that Paul Singer has helped pass marriage equality in states and raised money for four Republicans who voted for equality with the vast majority of Democrats in New York. But, meanwhile, he is undermining LGBT rights -- and all progressive causes -- by helping opponents of equality win more House races and helping Republicans win control of the Senate.Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesI challenge you to discover your trigger. Don\u0027t let it pass you by though. To the naked eye, your trigger may at first seem like a reason to eat a pint of Ben \u0026 Jerry\u0027s and binge-watch OITNB, but if you look closely, it could be your moment to shed some skin (and possibly, a few pounds).Blog editor, Huffington PostAnother US and British intervention in Iraq may halt the IS advance, but it will not address the major task of dealing with the Sunni political grievance. However monstrous the Islamic State has become, it is a monster Western intervention has created.Editor, Middle East EyeI am American. Some of my ancestors were born here and knew no other land, some of my ancestors journeyed here from Europe, and some of my ancestors were brought here from Africa. I don\u0027t know the complete stories of any of their lives, but I know their stories merge to create mine. One that is very specifically American.If the type of telescope described here can be built, then the tyranny of distance is vanquished. You can forget deep space probes and their long travel times. We could explore alien worlds in the comfort of our own homes, as our laptops scroll and zoom through data sets collected by a mammoth, space-based telescope array.Senior Astronomer, SETI InstituteThere you have it: two extremely prominent political figures who got rich off the housing bubble, now taking time from their busy schedule to call on the Fed to raise interest rates and destroy millions of jobs. In the \"show no shame\" contest, this looks like a real winner.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027I\u0027ve been using e-mail since 1981 (yikes!), so I\u0027ve probably made or received every e-mail mistake possible. It has definitely given me some insight into e-mail etiquette.Online job search expert, Job-Hunt.org writerThere is something deep in the American psyche which resents and resists military-style force in our neighborhoods.Former 16-year member of the U.S. Congress and two-time U.S. presidential candidateACA dead-enders will stay at it, fighting Medicaid expansion and filing creative, hopeless lawsuits. They\u0027ll stop Medicaid expansion in some states, denying coverage to millions of the most needy. But the ACA will survive. In health care policy, the arc of history has taken a decisive turn toward human decency.Author, \"The Hippocratic Myth,\" Professor of Law, Georgetown University \u0026 Co-Director, Center for Transnational Legal Studies, LondonCongress and the Obama administration cannot wait any longer to come to agreement on reforming our corporate tax code to remove the loophole that creates this perverse incentive for sending job overseas and, instead, incentivize job growth at home.Governor of DelawareThere\u0027s not a handbook for cancer caregiving; you learn as you go. I\u0027m not yet a mother, but I anticipate it\u0027s a similar feeling, being thrown into the unknown and getting really frickin\u0027 good at it.Television development, NBC UniversalThis year on World Humanitarian Day, we are calling on all governments to live up to their commitments to protect humanitarian staff and hold accountable those who attack them.United Nations Under-Secretary-General and the Emergency Relief Coordinator (USG/ERC)I revisit a 1988 documentary in which Angelou and I attended a conference on \"Facing Evil,\" held in the Hill Country of central Texas. Evil was a topic about which Angelou, the victim of childhood rape and virulent racism, had a lot to say.Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyI wish I had known then that a lot of us, in fact nearly every freshman, feels that insecurity in some way or another -- wondering whether they will succeed, whether people will like them, whether they can do the work.University Chaplain, University of PennsylvaniaI distinctly remember thinking that if a few more minutes had gone by, he wouldn\u0027t have been holding a camera.Registered nurse behind the blog Adventures of a Labor Nurse: the Highs and Lows of Labor and DeliveryGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"THE UNTOLD STORY Random Acts Of Kindness In Ferguson...
