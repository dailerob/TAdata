{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Has Yellen herself become more of an inflation hawk -- or is she just trying to reassure money markets and mollify her own colleagues at the Fed, most of whom are more hawkish than she is? A careful reading of the speech suggests that Yellen doesn\u0027t entirely believe her own posture. What\u0027s much more likely is that the strong vote on September 17, in which the Fed\u0027s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted 9 to 1 against raising rates now, was part of a tacit agreement to raise them after a decent interval. The story told by the inflation hawks makes no sense, and Yellen has argued against it in other speeches and testimony. Low interest rates in a weak economy have not triggered inflation, and there are no signs that inflation will break out any time soon. The idea, promoted in some circles, that we need to raise rates now in case we need to cut them later, is equally silly.Intellectual property rights -- patents, trademarks, and copyrights -- have been enlarged and extended, for example, creating windfalls for pharmaceutical companies. At the same time, antitrust laws have been relaxed for corporations with significant market power, such as big food companies, cable companies facing little or no broadband competition, big airlines, and the largest Wall Street banks.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The 92-year-old Kissinger has a long history of involvement in Iran and his recent opposition to Barack Obama\u0027s Iran nuclear deal, while relatively subdued by present Washington standards, matters. In it lies a certain irony, given his own largely unexamined record in the region.Professor of History, New York UniversityThe systemic exclusion of women from equality before God in the priestly leadership of the Catholic Church is a scandal, and it needs to be rectified with the same passionate compassion Pope Francis has applied to others who are excluded.Professor of Theology, Chicago Theological SeminaryFor our own sake as well as their party\u0027s, Ted Cruz\u0027s colleagues need to seal off his path to power, inflicting on Cruz the public ostracism which befell McCarthy, sent skulking to the political margins with Joseph Welch\u0027s famed admonition still ringing in his ears.Author, political commentatorAs an old Arab saying goes, \"The enemy of my enemy is my friend.\" But even though the U.S. and its allies, Russia, Iran, Iraq, the Kurds and Syria all have an urgent need to defeat ISIS, their competing interests make a solution difficult to achieve.Hofstra Journalism ProfessorWhile the media remains obsessed with Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton\u0027s emails, a revitalized progressive movement is forging a new economic agenda that is energizing and mobilizing activists all over the country.Co-Founder, Democracy PartnersThe last few days have also often left me feeling uncomfortable. There was a mood of self-congratulation in New York. Governments and business suggested in their speeches that all is under control, that we are already on track to solve the big issues and that all are united in doing the right thing. I wish that was true, but I know it is not.Executive Director, Greenpeace InternationalCandidates for president, most especially on the right, demonstrate a meanness of spirit, a disrespect for propriety, and a preference for polarizing invective that poisons the social cohesion so essential to progress.Founder, Leadership for a Responsible SocietyIranian officials\u0027 rhetoric and tone on the Yemen crisis has slightly changed. This change was initiated because of the shift in Iran\u0027s foreign policy regarding how to use \"diplomacy\" and the appropriate wording in order to achieve Tehran\u0027s ideological, geopolitical and economic objectives.President of the International American CouncilThe small band of Tea Party radicals wields its power because most other Republican members of Congress are cowed by the primary threats if they do not adhere strictly to Tea Party dictates. Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) has had his life as speaker made miserable by this dynamic.Last person on Earth not on FacebookThere are some political problems that defy easy solutions -- the rise of extreme partisanship, or our broken campaign finance system, for instance. But it should not be difficult to rally our elected leaders to remedy an eminently fixable problem threatening our democracy.Deputy Director, Brennan Center for Justice Democracy ProgramVoting rights researcher, Brennan Center for JusticeConsidering that we are faced with a situation which is totally unprecedented since the Second World War, We call on the states of the European Union to come to an agreement and take action. An adequate response is urgent if we want to prevent a dangerous rise in racism and xenophobia.Under-Secretary General of the United Nations; Chair, UNITAIDI had been talking about how to get more sleep for a long time -- but really I was just complaining about being tired.

It has been stirring within the consciousness of Americans for years, as we\u0027ve slowly awakened to the chronic and systematic diminishment of the democratic foundations without which we are no longer anything even approaching who we say we are.AuthorTrump, Sanders and the other outsiders will probably not win their party\u0027s presidential nominations. But the rage they are articulating is not going away. In all likelihood these Occupy issues will be co-opted by more establishment and semi-establishment figures like Rubio, Bush, Clinton, and Biden.Former reporter for the New York Times and Daily News; taught Political Science at NYUThe last several weeks has seen some extraordinary developments in Russia\u0027s role in the Syrian Civil War. Russia has deployed 28 Suhkoi jet fighters, roughly two squadrons, in Syria.

However, I don\u0027t think ANYONE should see Stonewall. Not because of its politics or revisionism, but because Stonewall is a terrible movie. Like really, really terrible.Gentleman farmer, film critic for ReThink ReviewsImagine a South Asia without borders. People, industries, goods and services flow freely in the most profitable way for all. Imagine that necessities sorely needed in one area are freely available from areas where there is plenty. South Asia\u0027s story of poverty amidst plenty would begin to change. These are some of the possibilities that most of the commerce ministers from South Asia, together with leaders of business and industry, media and the arts, will be discussing for three days in Delhi at the first South Asia Economic Conclave.Vice President for the South Asia Region, World Bank GroupI\u0027ve been straddling the worlds of business and philanthropy.
