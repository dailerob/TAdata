{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This was a week of winning, losing, and sometimes winning by losing. On Wednesday, the Obama administration finally won the wide-ranging consensus it\u0027s always wanted by losing to a unanimous Supreme Court, which ruled decisively that police must get a warrant to search a cell phone during an arrest. On Thursday we all lost, as former Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker passed away. Known as \"the Great Conciliator,\" he was a symbol of a more moderate -- and more effective -- Republican Party. In the World Cup, Uruguayan star Luis Suarez avoided using his hands, but not his teeth. For his toddler-worthy meltdown he was banned nine matches and given a four-month time-out. Meanwhile, the U.S. won by losing, advancing to the knockout stage of the tournament even while losing to Germany, thanks to Portugal beating Ghana. The U.S. fell only one goal short of remaining unbeaten, but, unlike Italy, they at least remained unbitten.President Barack Obama blogs for HuffPost.44th President of the United StatesWhether finding new ways to open unserved markets or putting people to work modernizing our nation\u0027s infrastructure, there are many ways to create good jobs by solving some of the biggest problems facing our communities. The key is seeing the opportunities beyond the obstacles.42nd President of the United States; Founder, Clinton FoundationDangerous sectarian tensions, massive movements of refugees, daily atrocities and spreading instability make the civil war in Syria a global threat. All the values for which we stand, and all the reasons for which the United Nations exists, are at stake across the devastated landscape that is Syria today.Secretary-General, United NationsIn a very general sense, in evaluating the constitutionality of law restricting speech, the Court has drawn an important distinction between laws that restrict speech because of its message (\"content-based\" laws) and laws that restrict speech without regard to its message (\"content-neutral\" laws).Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoThis month has brought ample evidence of the power of sleep to affect us in both positive and negative ways, and demonstrated why we need to start treating sleep as the vital health, safety and social issue that it is.Carrying loaded -- or even unloaded -- military-style weapons that are intentionally designed to look like props from a Michael Bay movie goes light years beyond peaceably protesting -- and merges into being ominous, sneering intimidation of innocent people.Managing Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowToday only 20 percent of U.S. families have a working father and a stay-at-home mother. Instead, two thirds of families depend either partly or wholly on the wages of working women, and many of those families are barely making it. Fully 42 million women in this country and the 28 million kids who depend on them are teetering on or over the brink of poverty.Award-winning journalist, bestselling author and activistFounder and CEO, Tipping Point CommunityWhile this particular column of Will\u0027s was offensive and inaccurate, that doesn\u0027t mean the St. Louis Dispatch was right, or even wise, to discontinue running his column in general. Debate and discussion are what have helped bring much of the long and ongoing mistreatment of victims by school administrations to light.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarOur war in Iraq was fundamentally a war of choice, and it was the wrong choice -- a war fought on false pretenses and for false purposes. But this \"cake-walk\" became an occupation, with years of vicious and deadly street warfare, sectarian violence, constant terrorist bombings, and finally no real political solutions to unite the country.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersPeople may assume that with a last name like \"Warrior,\" the baton of victory must have been handed to me. The truth is far from it.Chief Technology and Strategy Officer, CiscoThe IRS simply does not have the budget to do its lawful job effectively, which is to collect revenue for the U.S. government. What does that mean for taxpayers?Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorSeven years later, Clinton is considering another run at the presidency. Once again, she is the dominant brand in the marketplace, the one to beat.Co-director, Foreign Policy In FocusWith a record number of female candidates running and with women making up 53 percent of the vote, we were able to elect a record number of women to Congress. My hope is that we can do this once again in 2014. Because this isn\u0027t just about numbers -- it\u0027s also about policies.U.S. Senator from New YorkHaiti is affected by the worst deforestation any country has experienced, which is currently at 98.5 percent. As it is, people in Haiti are affected by severe poverty, which forces them to cut down trees for fuel for cooking.Nobel Peace Prize winner; founder, Grameen Bank; Chairman, Yunus CentreCo-founder and CEO, Yunus Social BusinessOver the years, I have witnessed the steady decline of the dolphins that used to chase our boat, the fish that I could land, and the plentiful shellfish I took for granted. The oceans of my childhood have been overfished, polluted, and strewn with plastic waste.Academy Award nominated actressThe important thing is that a film doesn\u0027t obliterate a book. The movie is here now. But the book hasn\u0027t gone away. It has simply grown up, grown larger, and begun to glisten in a new way.Author, \u0027The Giver\u0027When it comes to appearance, our bodies are considered guilty until proven innocent. The areas for judgement, from space between thighs to brow ridge prominence, are so numerous that it feels safer to just settle on one and own it.News Editor, HuffPost WomenWhile the world promised that by the end of next year every single child would be at school, the total figure for children who are being deprived not just of an education but of the oxygen of opportunity was 57 million last year.Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationOne of the most important goals of any parent is to keep their baby healthy and safe. But what if there\u0027s something parents didn\u0027t know they should be doing? What if it could mean the difference between life and death?National Sounds of Pertussis® Campaign Ambassador, actress and mother of twoThis plays into the conspiratorial mindset of many conservative Americans who fatuously believe that the European nations, with their mixed economies and socialised medicine, are Bolshevik enclaves, while bemoaning \"Communist fifth columnist\" Barack Obama for attempting to bring down the American way of life by reforming the beleaguered US healthcare system in the form of the Affordable Care Act.US Editor, The Huffington Post UKFifty years later it\u0027s time for another movement to demand a fairer and more just Mississippi and America and end the violence of poverty and illiteracy. Repeat after me: We, the people.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundIt turns out that many physicians don\u0027t trust themselves to make competency decisions about whether people should own or carry guns.Mike the Gun GuyI want to watch a show that criticizes our reliance on incarceration, not one that depicts a jumpsuit as an item every woman needs in her closet. That helps viewers see how an unequal social playing field can set women up for failure, not one that highlights women\u0027s faulty individual choices.Assistant Professor of Applied Psychology, NYU’s Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human DevelopmentHow can we build a 21st century workplace that supports thriving employees, growing businesses, and healthy economies all at once? At the heart of this conversation is workplace flexibility. In other words, how do we create a flexible and inclusive work environment that enables employees to meet their responsibilities both at work and at home?President, Center for American ProgressGlobal Chairman and CEO, Ernst \u0026 YoungIn two cases from both coasts, consolidated into a single opinion the Court held that the privacy interests in protecting the tremendous amount of personal information stored on cell phones outweighs the government\u0027s interest to its immediate access by police, even after a suspect is lawfully arrested.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityMany today are calling for us to create a much more vocational style of teaching.
