{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week brought powerful reminders of what happens when a government fails its citizens. On Wednesday, as the nation continued to mark the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina\u0027s unnecessarily tragic destruction of a uniquely American city, the nation woke to yet another uniquely American tragedy, as two Roanoke-based news staffers -- reporter Alison Parker, and cameraman Adam Ward -- were gunned down on live television. It was the beginning of a news cycle we know all too well: shock, outrage, calls for sensible guns laws, and then, if past is prologue, nothing. Since the Newtown shootings in 2012, nearly 85,000 Americans have been killed by guns -- yet common sense gun legislation proposed at the time by President Obama continues to languish. On Thursday, the president called Katrina \"a man-made disaster, a failure of government to look out for its own citizens.\" The same could be said of Roanoke.\"We\u0027re going to push and push until some larger force makes us stop.\" David Addington, the legal adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney, made that declaration to Jack Goldsmith of the Office of Legal Counsel in the months after September 11, 2001.Professor of Literature, Yale UniversityMy gold medal is my most-prized possession -- I\u0027m so proud of it. However, I never wanted my kids to feel like they had to have a gold medal in order to be considered a success... so I haven\u0027t displayed my medal. Here\u0027s where it currently lives...Public speaker, activist, OlympianI get the appeal in blaming Republicans. I understand the attraction in good vs. evil stories. I see the strength in the partisan rally. I get it\u0027s a great strategy for winning elections. But it is not a strategy for governing. We won\u0027t have a functioning government until we create a functioning democracy.Law professor, activist, possible candidate in the Democratic Primary for PresidentFashion Week: for a young woman recovering from anorexia, attending fashion week, surrounded by beautiful people, skinny models, and a society which is centered around appearances, is similar to sending a recovering alcoholic to a bar that serves free drinks all night. Basically, a huge trigger.ViolinistEmphasizing that you are campaigning with the people, not on stage before the people, is what helps build the movement that will continue after the election -- win or lose.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorI\u0027ve always talked about getting out of my comfort zone as an artist. Well, this is as outside of my comfort zone as I\u0027ve ever been. For the first time, I\u0027ll be singing and speaking on the stage, as well as dancing. And I\u0027ve only had two weeks to prepare my lines, take vocal lessons, and learn new choreography.Principal Dancer, American Ballet TheatreTrump\u0027s tropes recycle these themes, in more nationalist, bawdy and bigoted rants. And in indicting our failed trade policies, defending Social Security and Medicare, questioning mindless interventions, he strays from the Republican gospel to appeal to the concerns of working Americans. He\u0027s calling out the phonies and offering himself as a true man on the horse to make America great again. The Republican establishment may just find themselves reaping what they have sown.President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureIs it really such a huge inconvenience to responsible gun owners to have to undergo a background check? Wouldn\u0027t gun owners put up with a little inconvenience if it meant that Alison Parker could talk to her father every day and Adam Ward could walk down the aisle with his beloved, Melissa? Maybe, maybe if it was harder to get a gun, Vester Flanagan wouldn\u0027t have ended up with one in his hands.President \u0026 Editor-in-Chief, HollywoodLife.comOne day, you realize how absurd your current mindset is, that this shit doesn\u0027t matter. You let your demons go, knowing that, perhaps, sharing your story can help some other chubby, goofy, socially-isolated, sensitive kid getting bulled in America who feels like no one in the world cares about him.Former NFL playerHe kept mumbling the same thing over and over again. I leaned in further to hear him more clearly, \"forever and ever, forever and ever, forever and ever...\"Campaigns and Communications Manager for LGBT Progress, Center for American ProgressReading the paper is all too often a jarring experience, but it was especially so on Monday. It\u0027s impossible to ignore the disconnect between the well-deserved recognition of Julian Bond\u0027s life, and the stark evidence that we have so far to go in order to secure the ideals he championed.Founder, People for the American WayThe Treasury Department\u0027s exciting announcement that U.S. paper currency will soon feature the image of a historical American female was a long time coming.Treasurer of the United StatesWhat William F. Buckley and Gore Vidal did for discourse in America was unprecedented. They proved there was a time not so long ago we relished hearing both sides of political arguments. And there is a time -- call it the present -- when a hunger for authenticity seems to be driving both parties in unexpected directions.CEO, Professional Investor and Chairman, Intelligence Squared U.S. DebatesThe Missouri House hearing was a disaster. No agenda was given to us committee members except for a jumble of abortion statute links. The hearing began with the joint chairs asking what we all wanted to address. It was then that I wanted to stand up and scream.Missouri State RepresentativeThe failure to implement even the most general or common sense reforms in the light of 800 mass shootings is an absolute refusal to lead on the part of Congress. It\u0027s a flat out disregard for the safety of American citizens. It\u0027s shameful political cowardice.Navy veteran and Co-Director of the Truman National Security Project San Diego ChapterAn unprecedented group of Iranian human rights defenders and pro-democracy activists have come out in a massive wave in support of Iran nuclear agreement.President, National Iranian American CouncilCarly Fiorina recognizes the danger that a technology-dominated classroom -- a classroom focused on programmable skills rather than on messy and ever-changing ideas -- will become the location of job training rather than intellectual exploration.Davidson-Kahn Distinguished University Professor and Professor of Law at Florida International University; Floershimer Distinguished Visiting Professor of Law at Cardozo Law SchoolWhen you\u0027re a teenager and life feels like a big confusing mess, there are certain things you can usually count on -- like, where your home is. But after Katrina, I didn\u0027t even have that anymore. All I knew was that we wouldn\u0027t be going back to New Orleans. At least not for awhile.Associate Editor, The Huffington PostMost professors in this situation would have patted themselves on the back for having managed to get the article back online and then turned their attention back to their usual work of teaching and scholarship. But Dreger has made a career out of defending academic freedom.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoPit bulls are dogs. Just dogs. Gloriously, dogs. Like all dogs, they need love, socialization, supervision -- the whole usual shebang. And as with dogs generally, most of them are smooshy lovebugs. Unfortunately, the few who aren\u0027t get the lion\u0027s share of attention.Animal Welfare Editor, The Huffington PostIt is important that the public have a clear idea of what is at stake in the Fed\u0027s decisions on interest rates. While many politicians and policy experts are grappling with ways to try to lower the poverty rate, the Fed will be directly preventing people from seeing pay increases.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027On August 7, the Senate left town for its month-long summer recess, a pretty long break for lawmakers who have accomplished so little. When the Senate returns on September 8, it needs to start doing the people\u0027s business. Surely, the American people, and our federal judicial system, deserve better than this.Vice President, Constitutional Accountability Center (CAC).Davis is going down as a martyr to cause, having galvanized bigots and religious extremists across Kentucky and across the country, claiming that their religious freedom has been infringed upon by the Supreme Court\u0027s ruling.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington Post\"No more anchor babies!\" \"We\u0027ll make the illegals build the wall!\" \"Repeal the 14th Amendment!\" Whatever leads us to our next president, I fear there will be nothing inspirational, sublime, or hopeful about it.

This, after abducting several Christians, in what has become the group\u0027s long scourge on humanity. Contrary to ISIS\u0027s ignorance and propaganda, Prophet Muhammad sought to protect the rights of Christians.Visiting Fellow, Harvard University\u0027s Prince Alwaleed bin Talal School of Islamic StudiesPlease, pit bull lovers, stop saying \"it\u0027s all how they\u0027re raised.\" I know you mean well. But if you truly believe \"it\u0027s all how they\u0027re raised,\" no stray shelter dog or abused dog would be safe to place in a home.Dog trainer. Canine, feline and equine behavior counselor. Animal behavior nerd.If someone really thinks the great \"email\" story -- or the Benghazi investigation -- are going to sink her candidacy, I\u0027ve got a bridge to sell them.Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersYes, I know, and I agree: Motherhood is precious. Babies are miracles. Time goes too fast. The days are long, but the years are short. But here\u0027s what people don\u0027t get: I can enjoy my baby and still wish he would sleep.Blogger at Raves \u0026 Revelations, writer, digital content guru, marketer, social media maven, wife and momRead, or better yet, talk to a political reporter or Republican operative about the Donald and you find a pattern. Left, Middle and most of the Right there is contempt, head-shaking and bad, predictable jokes.Senior Fellow, DemosGov. Kasich thinks the problem with teachers is the teachers\u0027 lounge. The problem with teachers is this: We are having to deal with laws that are being passed by people who have not one single clue as to what our job entails. Go ahead, good sir!
