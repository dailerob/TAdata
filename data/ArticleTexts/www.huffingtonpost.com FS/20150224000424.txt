{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027You may recall a campus slogan from another era, \"Hey, hey. Ho, ho. Western civ. has got to go.\" That was at Stanford University in 1987, part of a wave of demands to limit traditional courses featuring dead while males, in favor of cultural pluralism. Sure enough, many colleges a generation later have more varied courses. Today, however, there are people out there who feel that western civilization really does have to go -- not the courses but the thing itself. And they seem to be gaining. Call me sentimental, call me privileged, but I have a certain fondness for western civilization. Let me count the ways. I like the rule of law. I like the Enlightenment sensibility that a wide variety of religions and viewpoints must be accommodated. I like the connection of free speech and free inquiry to the scientific method -- giving reason, logic and evidence priority over faith.From President Obama\u0027s calls for equal pay to the House Democrats\u0027 Women Succeed agenda to the nonpartisan National Women\u0027s Law Center to now Oscar night itself, this issue is gaining traction.Chair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusDespite some progress over the past few years, gender-based legal restrictions remain significant. Almost 90 percent of countries have at least one important restriction in the books, and some have many.Managing Director, IMFThe rise of \"independent contractors\" is the most significant legal trend in the American workforce -- contributing directly to low pay, irregular hours and job insecurity. It\u0027s become a race to the bottom.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027For the third time in four years, the Oscar for Best Picture has gone to a film about film -- a \"meta-film\" if you will. If we wanted to, we could take this observation and ask the question: What does this say about the Academy? But instead, why don\u0027t we take this Academy bias and ask a harder question.Social Scientist, Duke UniversitySo many war correspondents are similar to the many men and women in uniform, who work hard, do their jobs, and even perform acts of heroism, that you\u0027ll never hear about, and who never go around bragging, seeking recognition. Then, we have Bill O\u0027Reilly.Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranKYIV -- What happens in Ukraine -- not the financial standoff with Greece -- will be the ultimate test of whether European and transatlantic unity endure. The fault lines extending from Ukraine are undermining the fundamental values that have underpinned Europe\u0027s postwar peace and prosperity. Failure to defend those values in Ukraine will cause them to unravel far beyond our borders.Fmr. prime minister of Ukraine; Current leader of All-Ukrainian Union \"Fatherland\" (\"Batkivshchyna\")Last week the nation was treated to the sad and embarrassing spectacle of Jeb Bush, mollycoddled scion to an empire of failure, proclaiming that \"I\u0027m my own man.\" Here\u0027s a simple rule of thumb: Anyone who has to say he\u0027s his own man, or woman, isn\u0027t.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourPenn\u0027s unwarranted remark is as obscene as questioning, \"who gave blacks the right to vote?\" or \"who gave women the right to pursue an education?\"Student and campus-editor-at-large, Florida State UniversityAs controversy surrounding Bill O\u0027Reilly and his previous claims of harrowing \"combat\" journalism escalates, this would be the moment when most news organizations would step in and announce that an internal review was underway to ascertain the truth. But not Fox News.Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaIran\u0027s youth are eager to play an assertive role but through peaceful behaviors that would force the regime to comply.Author, The Lonely War: One Woman’s Account of the Struggle for Modern IranThe point is sexual orientation varies amongst almost everyone. It\u0027s fine if you\u0027ve known that you are straight for your entire life. But it\u0027s also fine for people who aren\u0027t straight to know that for just as long. Or to have just realized it the other day.Student, University of Michigan-Ann ArborOne of the more depressing political attacks in recent history was launched by the former Mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, against President Obama. With strong implications of racism, Giuliani claimed that Obama did not love his country.Playwright, director, actor, educator, theater founderDo we need annual testing to tell us that poverty in childhood has lifelong consequences in health, education, and economic opportunity? Do we need annual testing to tell us that communities with high concentrations of minority students from impoverished households struggle on test-based measures?Director of Secondary Education and Secondary Special Education Teacher Preparation, Seton Hall UniversityEven for Pakistan-watchers who privilige nuance over sensation, the question of why our country continues to grapple with a disease that has been preventable for over half a century, certainly begs an answer.Health activist for Pakistan and Global CitizenChildren actively shape their sense of self, not just mentally, but with their hands, elbows and knees, their bellies and mouths, inside the frequency, textures and intensities of this constant, rich field of contact.Because Kindness Changes Everything...As a country, Haiti has faced and continues to face enormous difficulties, but it has also proven remarkably resilient.Director, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)Fried chicken just might be the world\u0027s most versatile food.Everything worth caring about in food, drink, and travelLet\u0027s be clear about who Giuliani is: a faded, irrelevant Republican leader who seeks attention and will say and do ridiculous things in order to achieve that. Though I myself have been accused of seeking attention, I seek attention around issues, causes and cases.President, National Action NetworkThe Academy Awards were created to recognize cinematic achievements in film. However, when the voters are primarily white men, it is not surprising that people of color are not given the recognition they deserve.Founder and managing director, Keating AdvisorsGraeme Wood\u0027s article in The Atlantic last week charging that ISIL is the natural expression of Islam has created quite a stir. Overwrought and poorly informed in its claim that the roots of violent extremism are in Mohammed and the Koran, and that Bakr al-Baghdadi is a theologian-prophet, it has given a boost to the Islamophobes.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghJust weeks ago, the Washington Post described Scott Walker as the first \"it\" candidate of the 2016 presidential races, but after stumbling over \"truth,\" evolution, and whether or not the President is a Christian or loves America, Walker is getting ready to change the topic.The Center for Media and Democracy/ALEC ExposedThe U.S. media has a China fever, which results in typically feverish reports that don\u0027t take the pulse of the country or its leader. In the process, so much is missed.Roving correspondent for the Asia TimesThe host of the awards has no place contradicting the view of a documentary filmmaker who has just spoken eloquently of the subject of her film.Paul J. Tillich Professor of Theology and Culture, Emeritus Union Theological Seminary; Author; TheologianIt makes little sense to continue with the same tactic of perpetual war, without any assurance of a better strategic outcome. To assume that another Iraq war will keep us \"safe\" doesn\u0027t address the nature of terrorism or the nature of failed wars.Columnist, journalist, and author published in The Hill\u0027s Congress Blog, The Jerusalem Post, Salon.com, and other publicationsNever did I ever expect Lady Gaga to do a medley of songs from The Sound of Music. Then when she introduced and embraced Dame Julie Andrews, I kept thinking \"Pop royalty meets actual royalty.\"Lawyer; writer; film, TV, and pop-culture aficionado; social media expert and correspondent; awards show enthusiast; and big dreamer.Vaccinations protect the human species against diseases for which there is no cure once the infection occurs. In this respect, vaccines become the cure for certain diseases through prevention, whereas we usually think of being cured as what doctors do to us after we get sick.Mike the Gun GuyWe were untamed, raw and daring. We used words like f*ck and sh*t proudly and loudly at stupid boys and into thin air. We didn\u0027t worry about what others thought about us, because we were happy with who we are.Published writer, advocate and mother.If \"Black lives\" REALLY MATTER, then we must acquire and exercise the right to vote to insure that we elect officials who will impartially administer the laws and manage those State and Municipal Agencies having jurisdiction over our children and our own daily lives.Diversity Visiting Professor, University of San Francisco; and Scholar Writer in Residence, MLK, Jr. Institute, Stanford UniversityWe cubicle dwellers have our own subculture. We are among the working class who don\u0027t get to go outside and blow stuff up. We can identify each other by the hollow looks in our eyes and the standard defeated shoulder slump. I am here to help you, my cubicle dwelling brothers and sisters.Blogger, mother, wife, drinker of tequilaThe billionaire Republican Governor of Illinois, Bruce Rauner, injected himself into ceremonies in Chicago last week presided over by the city\u0027s Democratic mayor and the nation\u0027s Democratic president.International President, United SteelworkersGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"BIBI\u0027S BOMB BOMBSHELL BUSTED",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
