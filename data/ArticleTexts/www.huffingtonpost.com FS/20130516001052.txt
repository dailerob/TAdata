{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Peter S. GoodmanExecutive Business Editor, The Huffington PostLost in the latest political scandal is a simple fact: The Internal Revenue Service was acting in the public interest when it opted to train its auditing power on the Tea Party and affiliated groups. In castigating government as the root of all evil while portraying taxation as a form of tyranny, the Tea Party is no less than a mass celebration of the evasion of the basic responsibilities of American citizenship. Common sense alone tells you that people drawn to its ranks may feel extra temptation to find ways to limit what they surrender to the rogue federal bureaucrats who have supposedly seized the nation. The cover-up is the bad part here, as in nearly all Washington scandals. It\u0027s not the act itself that delivered the real trouble.Comments (1,820)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; host, \u0027The Breakdown\u0027; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureApparently leaks which keep the public informed require \"very aggressive action\" -- but crimes which shatter the economy, leaving millions without homes and millions more without jobs aren\u0027t worth lifting a finger to investigate.Comments (290)David WestinAuthor, \u0027Exit Interview\u0027; Former President, ABC NewsThe Associated Press is outraged that the Justice Department has been secretly rummaging through its telephone records, and who can blame it? But what really matters is what it means for all the rest of us.Comments (42)Elliott NeginDirector of News \u0026 Commentary, Union of Concerned ScientistsPart 2: To understand just how the fossil fuel industry has been laundering climate disinformation, there are few better places to start than with the Washington, D.C.-based Competitive Enterprise Institute.Comments (37)Adam GrantWharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027What if searching for happiness actually prevents us from finding it? There\u0027s reason to believe that the quest for happiness might be a recipe for misery.Comments (16)Bonnie FullerPresident \u0026 Editor-in-Chief, HollywoodLife.comAngelina Jolie, you could have decided to be totally private about undergoing a double mastectomy and breast reconstruction surgeries. But that is not the woman you are.Comments (24)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Wall Street excesses brought the economy to the brink of collapse. But now the Wall Street behemoths are bigger than ever and President Obama is looking to cut the Social Security benefits of retirees. That will teach the Wall Street boys to be more responsible in the future.CommentsiJustineTechie, Gamer, Vlogger, Personality, she is the #3 most subscribed female personality on YouTubeEverything you\u0027re seeing in upcoming films like After Earth is not far off from our new future. In the first Fitness Tech episode, I tried out the miCoach Supernova Glide Bra by Adidas with heart monitoring capabilities.CommentsGavin ShulmanWriter, ProducerThe point isn\u0027t to have one, it\u0027s to make it quickly and efficiently and then pin it on the president. To exploit a scandal for scandal\u0027s sake. Because scandals are the only way to shrink our deficit, improve our financial outlook, and allow the Dow to set all sorts of records.Comments (14)Danielle TumminioAuthor, \u0027God and Harry Potter at Yale\u0027I met two Mormon missionaries on a chilly spring evening when my husband and I attended the musical \"The Book of Mormon.\" They were handing out copies of the LDS Scriptures -- aka the original Book of Mormon -- near the theatre entrance, and I couldn\u0027t resist talking with them.Comments (291)Barbra StreisandSinger; Actress; Director; Composer; ActivistSometimes in the face of national tragedy, politics should take a backseat. The hypocrisy of turning Benghazi into a deliberate cover-up scandal is preposterous at a time when the nation faces so many serious problems.Comments (806)David KarpfAssistant professor of media and public affairs, George Washington UniversityThe IRS \"scandal\" continues to unfold in Washington. The whole thing is, frankly, pretty stupid. Fundamentally, the howls of conservative outrage are nothing more than demands for more \"politically correctness\" from government.CommentsKevin McDonoughSyndicated columnist and television criticFolks at the ACLU should remember the gales of ridicule that met Dan Quayle when he criticized a plot point on \"Murphy Brown.\" He was talking about a serious issue. But singling out the decisions of a sitcom character made the conversation seem slightly absurd.CommentsSheryl KraftFreelance WriterAngelina Jolie was not the only one to choose a prophylactic mastectomy. I did, too -- but for different reasons.. (Thank you, Angelina, for making it public. You\u0027ve given me the courage to write about it for the very first time).CommentsThe Center for Public IntegrityOriginal investigative journalismDuring the past two decades, individual employees of the agency have collectively increased their political giving, which has overwhelming benefited Democrats and liberal-leaning organizations.Comments (102)Spencer CritchleyMedia consultant, founder of Boots Road Group LLCGiven that any reasonable person can plainly see that our president is in fact trying to lead us to ruin, here\u0027s the good news: he\u0027s really, really bad at it.Comments (114)David TrumbleAward-winning artist, cartoonist and illustratorI have met more than my share of inspiring, incredible women over the last year, the majority of whom have been very young indeed, and they all seem to have a very definite idea of who their role models are. And when I listed a few of them in my head today, I found myself asking the question: How many of these women would be improved by a few extra sparkles?Comments (52)Daraja AcademySecondary boarding school for Kenyan girlsWithout a secondary school education, even the most modest dreams of improving one\u0027s station in life become just that: a dream.CommentsLarry WomackFounder, 1450 Media; former Associate News Editor, The Huffington PostThe J.J. Abrams Kirk is the Kirk of parody: Kirk the womanizer, Kirk the rule-flouting powder keg, Kirk the prideful egomaniac. Kirk the caricature. It works in a broad sense because that\u0027s the idea of Kirk that people who\u0027ve never actually seen Star Trek have imprinted in their minds.Comments (77)FoodbeastCooking a fresh ear of corn on the cob can be cumbersome... if you don\u0027t know what you\u0027re doing.Comments (253)Christina TeaniSpecial education teacherI was born with a profound hearing loss and have worn hearing aids for as long as I can remember. Growing up in a large \"hearing family,\" I had to learn to speak and read lips, but I always felt like something was missing.CommentsMichael BurnsVice Chairman of LionsgateTo paraphrase former President Ronald Reagan, anyone who doesn\u0027t recognize that our financial community still has heroes, even in this troubled and cynical era, isn\u0027t looking in the right place, and Jamie Dimon at the helm of JPMorgan is foremost among them.Comments (202)Kate ScharffPsychotherapist, Divorce Expert, Author, Founder of Collaborative Practice Center of Greater WashingtonIt\u0027s hard to imagine, but even if you never fully forgive your cheating spouse, your feelings of anger will likely soften over time. It would be tragic if you sent a destructive message now that you couldn\u0027t take back later.Comments (98)Naomi AngelWriterAngelina Jolie has just gone public with the news that she had a preventative double mastectomy. As a BRCA1 gene mutation carrier, she had an 87% higher risk of breast cancer. In January, I also found out that I have the BRCA1 gene mutation. But for me, the test came late, after I had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer that had already spread to my lymph nodes.Comments (13)Will BunchAuthor, \u0027Tear Down This Myth\u0027Let\u0027s be clear -- this is about Obama... and it is about much, much more than Obama. It is yet another example of how the national security state that has dominated our political life since World War II has corrupted the American soul.Comments (1,067)Jason AlexanderActorGood men and women in the Middle East are struggling for their futures, their dignities, and their security. We have a role to play, no matter how small. I have taken a part, but this cast is large. And the players need you. It is a great story. You really shouldn\u0027t miss it.Comments (227)Jamie Lee CurtisActress and children\u0027s book authorAngelina Jolie\u0027s revelation today, done with eloquence and dignity and grace, is remarkable both in its message and its import to the world of women. Pro-action.Comments (135)Maeve DunneHalf The Sky Movement campus ambassadorIn India, education is not a civil right but rather a privilege that young children dream and wish to be a part of.CommentsLeighton WoodhouseCo-founder, DogParkMedia.comMark Zuckerberg\u0027s widely reviled, rapidly dissolving DC lobby group heralds itself as the bringer of \"different and innovative tactics\" to the usual Beltway brand of back room politicking. How did so many smart, powerful people so thoroughly screw up such a simple and straightforward task?CommentsDr. Judith RodinPresident of the Rockefeller FoundationWe can\u0027t know for sure when or where the next crisis will hit -- only that it will. But despite these certainties, most cities are woefully unprepared to manage these shocks. Now is the time to help cities build resilience.Comments (40)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Many of you soon-to-be college graduates are determined to make the world a better place. But many of you are cynical about politics. You see the system as inherently corrupt. You doubt real progress is possible. Let me remind you: Cynicism is a self-fulfilling prophesy.Comments (254)Charlotte Robinson, 2013.15.05Richard (RJ) Eskow, 2013.15.05Verelyn Gibbs Watson, 2013.15.05Bianca Bosker, 2013.15.05Chris Weigant, 2013.15.05Rich Rubino, 2013.15.05Lisa Lori, 2013.15.05Turnstyle, 2013.15.05Brendan DeMelle, 2013.15.05David Karpf, 2013.15.05Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"FALL, GUY",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
