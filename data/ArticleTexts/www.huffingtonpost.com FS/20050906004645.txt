{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AP/Rick BowmerAP/Lawrence JacksonTo those who say this isn\u0027t the time to assess blame and point fingers over the Katrina tragedy, I say now is precisely the time. If we\u0027ve learned anything from watching shows like CSI, Law \u0026 Order, and their endless progeny, it\u0027s that you can\u0027t let a crime scene grow cold. You\u0027ve got to start collecting and analyzing the evidence while the DNA is still fresh and let David Caruso or Vincent D\u0027Onofrio start sweating the perps while the passions are still running high. And make no mistake, what we saw go down -- and not go down -- in New Orleans was definitely a crime, a crime that is in many ways still in progress... So let a thousand pointed fingers bloom!READ POST | comments (39)09.06.2005 David CornBill Kristol, the neocon prince, sounds as if he\u0027s making excuses for an irresponsible teenager.READ POST | comments (20)09.06.2005 Bob CescaEvery deadly error, every mispoken word, every smirk, every petulant remark, every misstep we\u0027ve observed spread out over five years has been condensed into a single week and underscored by thousands of dead bodies.READ POST | comments (31)09.06.2005 Harry ShearerIn Sunday\u0027s Los Angeles Times, Joel Kotkin prescribes the medicine New Orleans needs: be more like Houston.

Bush is a disaster. It\u0027s the nation\u0027s bad luck that FEMA is too busy to tend to the real cause of our federal emergency.READ POST09.06.2005 Robert SchlesingerAn H5N1 influenza outbreak could mimic the 1918 pandemic. That could mean 1.7 million deaths in the United States and 360 million dead worldwide, perhaps more.READ POST09.06.2005 Deepak ChopraSometime during the 2004 presidential election, I saw a Republican right-wing fundamentalist on TV -- I don\u0027t remember his home state, but it was a red one -- saying, \"As long as you godless liberals despise us, we will never go away.\"READ POST | comments09.06.2005 Toby BarlowIt\u0027s the infrastructure, stupid. Many people who opposed going to war did so not out of any weak passivism, but because they knew that important priorities were being left behind. Priorities like say, oh, repairing the levees.READ POST09.06.2005 John FundAs plans to rebuild New Orleans are made, a top priority must be to remake the city\u0027s police force from top to bottom.READ POST | comments (22)09.06.2005 Marty KaplanThis kind of manipulation is consensual; it’s what happens when a bizarre postmodern journalistic convention (liars deserve equal time) meets the power that Rove wields so ruthlessly.READ POST | comments (42)09.06.2005 Stephen FryBritish reporters I know who have been to New Orleans speak of one thing above all others. The dreadful, vomit-inducing stench. Not just the stench of death, which heaven knows is dreadful enough, but the stench of life.READ POST | comments (21)09.06.2005 Eric BoehlertSome Bush supporters seem oddly giddy over the results of a post-Katrina poll which finds Americans split over the president\u0027s handling of the calamity.READ POST | comments (15)09.06.2005 Jaron LanierMichael Brown ought to not only be fired but be in jail.
