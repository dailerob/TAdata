{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOA new poll this week showed Sarah Palin\u0027s approval ratings nosediving -- especially among women. It\u0027s as if she had been the new guest at a long-running dinner party: at first we were grateful for the new blood and, after oft-repeated tales of fighter pilot heroism and Harvard Law achievement, delighted to hear fresh stories about moose burgers, government jets sold on eBay, boondoggle bridges rejected, and lipsticked pit bulls. But suddenly we couldn\u0027t help but notice that the house was on fire. And as amused as they were by all the new stories and new characters, the American people knew that the \"Welcome Sarah\" party was over. It\u0027s time to get serious.Read Post | CommentsBIORobert L. Borosage, 09.21.2008These demands will be met with howls of outrage, a renting of pinstripes. It will require a Congress, lathered with Wall Street contributions, to insist on a deal that makes sense.Read Post | Comments (30)BIORobert F. Kennedy Jr., 09.15.2008Fascist writer Westbrook Pegler, an avowed racist who Sarah Palin approvingly quoted in her acceptance speech, expressed a fervent hope about my father, Robert F. Kennedy.Read Post | Comments (1388)BIORobert Kuttner, 09.21.2008Paulson spent the past two weeks playing a game of chicken with firms like Lehman Brothers and A.I.G. Now he is playing even higher-stakes chicken with Congress and the economy.Read Post | Comments (135)BIOJames Moore, 09.18.2008Don\u0027t let them tell you this economic meltdown is a complicated mess. It\u0027s not. Our national financial crisis is readily understood by anyone who has seen greed and hypocrisy.Read Post | Comments (836)BIOSen. Bernie Sanders, 09.21.2008This proposal is an unacceptable attempt to force middle income families to pick up the cost of fixing the horrendous economic mess that is the product of the Bush administration\u0027s deregulatory fever and Wall Street\u0027s insatiable greed.Read Post | Comments (185)BIOBarbra Streisand, 09.19.2008The last eight years have led to this disastrous unraveling of the U.S. economy. We can\u0027t continue with four more years of the irresponsible practices and policies of Bush. We can\u0027t afford John McCain.Read Post | Comments (560)BIOJohn Cusack, 09.15.2008Not just more of the same -- worse than the same. The Republicans have been ruinous and most of it stems from an ideology that leaves the government in ruins. McCain has been on board hook, line and sinker.Read Post | Comments (606)BIOGreg Zehner, 09.19.2008What this really signals is the beginning of the end of the United States as the financial capital of the world. Should you worry? Yes.Read Post | Comments (307)BIOSean Penn, 09.16.2008The victory for this country begins with a unified refusal to accept, not only the McCain/Palin ticket, but also the static and shallow conscience of the Republican base.Read Post | Comments (531)BIOArianna Huffington, 09.15.2008Sarah Palin may not have known what the Bush Doctrine was, but we\u0027re getting a pretty good idea of what the Palin Doctrine is. And what is it going to look like? Let\u0027s just say, it\u0027s going to seem familiar.Read Post | Comments (1228)BIOChris Kelly, 09.18.2008McCain will not only take on special interests and Washington insiders, he\u0027ll fundamentally alter human nature. And without raising taxes, either. He\u0027ll lead us to a sort of martial nirvana.Read Post | Comments (799)BIOLes Gara, 09.17.2008Since Monday the McCain camp has stepped up its personal attacks against Alaskans. They\u0027ve continued their D.C.-style tactics against neighbors in this small state.Read Post | Comments (400)Michael Weingartner and Lee Camp, 09.18.2008Mary Mapes, 09.15.2008David Rees, 09.17.2008Bernard-Henri Lévy, 09.14.2008Andy Borowitz, 09.19.2008James P.
