{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOMinneapolis-St. Paul -- Even without George Bush in the Twin Cities, the GOP cannot escape its miserable record over the last eight years. So you can see why Sarah Palin was such an appealing pick for John McCain. Along with all the things she brings to the table -- fresh face, mother of five, hockey mom -- Palin is notable for what she doesn\u0027t bring: a track record. If McCain had picked any of the far more experienced candidates on his short list, they would have come fully equipped with a long paper trail implicating them in the horror show that is the Republican Party of the last eight years. Palin has barely left a footprint on the GOP scene.Read Post | CommentsBIOA. Brooks, 09.01.2008I am now hearing from the Karl Roves of the world that having a 17-year-old daughter get pregnant out of wedlock will sympathize Palin to millions who know the pain of that situation. But my question is, where was the advice?Read Post | Comments (118)Bryan Gordon, 09.01.2008I have executive experience having overseen my neighborhood\u0027s annual block party for the past 16 years -- dealing in areas where some of my neighbors have been unruly and uncooperative.Read Post | Comments (29)BIOGeorge Lakoff, 09.01.2008The Palin nomination is not about external realities and what Democrats call \"issues,\" but about the symbolic mechanisms of the political mind -- the worldviews, frames, metaphors, cultural narratives, and stereotypes.Read Post | Comments (51)BIORuth Hochberger, 09.01.2008We in the press need to be absolutely sure that when we strip subjects of their privacy over matters they do not want disclosed, we have some higher ethical justification. In this case, there was none.Read Post | Comments (52)BIORichard Gizbert, 09.01.2008I\u0027m going to break a self imposed rule that says always allow breaking news to settle before deciding what it means and predict Sarah Palin will withdraw from the Republican ticket.Read Post | Comments (141)BIOSidney Blumenthal, 08.31.2008My information is that Karl Rove wanted Romney and pushed him. McCain pushed back -- he really wanted Lieberman, and that was completely out of the question. Palin is the result.Read Post | Comments (211)BIORJ Eskow, 09.01.2008The debate we should be having is getting lost in the noise of a salacious gossipfest at a young girl\u0027s expense. It\u0027s tactically wrong for the left to push this scandal - but more importantly it\u0027s morally wrong.Read Post | Comments (27)BIOHoward A. Rodman, 08.31.2008Apparently, the St. Paul police and FBI are doing just what the Constitution (and the Courts) say you cannot do -- put people in jail for no reason because you think they might make a fuss.Read Post | Comments (24)BIOAndy Borowitz, 09.01.2008It has become common for candidates to lash out against the news media, but Gov. Palin\u0027s attack was the first known example of a politician blaming the media for her daughter\u0027s pregnancy.Read Post | CommentsBIOMarty Kaplan, 09.01.2008His persona, and the story he is telling, and the media narrative that frames and delivers it to us, all come straight from the movies. Unfortunately, this movie may end really, really badly.Read Post | Comments (49)BIORichard Walden, 09.01.2008It\u0027s really too bad that Hurricanes Gustav and Hannah are striking before all of the helpful structural changes the Red Cross says it is making are firmly in place.Read Post | CommentsBIOSteve Clemons, 09.01.2008Many women do like Palin -- there will be a lot who will be drawn to her gutsy, take on Washington\u0027s vested interests style as well as to her womanhood.Read Post | Comments (31)Paul Loeb, 09.01.2008Robert L.
