{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Author, \u0027Our Fathers Ourselves. Daughters, Fathers, And The Changing American Family\u0027There\u0027s an increasingly sensitive tripwire between faith and policy these days. To question the latter is to incite charges you\u0027re denigrating the former. It\u0027s especially difficult when you\u0027re talking about the Catholic Church -- which, yes, has failed miserably in its handling of abuse, but has done so much over the years for so many. So let me put this out there right at the beginning: I love the power of faith. I respect those who embrace it. I applaud those who feel its comfort. But policy based on a narrow interpretation of faith -- that\u0027s a whole other issue, especially when policy with roots in Biblical times is wedged into modern realities.Read Post | Comments (235)Steve Clemons, 03/02/12Publisher, \u0027The Washington Note\u0027Israel, under Netanyahu\u0027s leadership, seems to want to drive a dynamic in which it demonstrates its power by compelling the President to attack Iran on its behalf. This is neither in Israel\u0027s real interests -- nor America\u0027s.Read Post | Comments (11)Chris Anderson, 03/02/12Curator of TEDRead Post | Comments (182)Simon Johnson, 03/02/12MIT professor; Co-author, \u002713 Bankers\u0027; Columnist on fiscal affairsIf you cut taxes, revenues will fall and deficits will increase. If you change the CBO\u0027s scoring process to hide this fact -- as is under consideration by leading Republicans -- you are engaging in exactly the same sort of deception that brought down Greece.Read Post | CommentsMatthew Dowd, 03/02/12Political strategistThe economy is still by far the dominant issue with voters concerned about jobs, finances, and the federal deficit\u0027s impact on economic growth. So why, in the Republican presidential primary, are candidates talking more and more about social and cultural issues like contraception?Read Post | Comments (15)Emmanuelle Chriqui, 03/02/12Actress and activistIt is time to bridge the gap between the suffering in Congo, and American consumers. We have the power to pressure companies to clean up their supply chains and not source from mines controlled by armed groups. We can demand that our products be conflict-free.Read Post | CommentsDavid Wild, 03/02/12TV Writer; Contributing Editor, Rolling Stone; Co-Author, \u0027Diary of a Player\"\u0027I say boycott Rush and The Rush Limbaugh Show -- at least until he apologizes openly to Sandra Fluke.Read Post | Comments (64)Gov. Martin O\u0027Malley, 03/02/12Governor of MarylandYesterday was a day for Maryland\u0027s children. It was a day for human dignity. After years of hard work, we signed a bill into law that protects individual civil marriage rights and religious freedom equally.Read Post | Comments (434)Morra Aarons-Mele, 03/02/12CEO, Women OnlineHow much further right from the center are we pushing political dialogue in this country when we\u0027re debating whether or insurance companies should cover birth control? How many more women\u0027s voices will we remove from the debate?Read Post | Comments (28)Michael B. Keegan, 03/02/12President, People For the American WayThe story is about more than one judge doing something wildly inappropriate. It\u0027s about a conservative movement in which the bile and animosity directed at the president are so poisonous that even someone who should know better confuses political criticism and sick personal attack.Read Post | Comments (25)Jayanti Tamm, 03/02/12Author, \u0027Cartwheels in a Sari: A Memoir of Growing Up Cult\u0027An uncomfortable silence filled the classroom. No one had started writing a response to the question I had written.

Gray, Ph.D., 03/02/12Senior Researcher, Microsoft Research New England; Associate Professor of Communication and Culture, Indiana UniversityRallying to punish Dharun Ravi does not do justice to Tyler Clementi\u0027s life, nor does it move us one step closer to preventing another young person from turning to suicide. The politics of blame are a dead end. Instead, we need to build out an ethos of shared responsibility.Read Post | CommentsJames Kwak, 03/02/12Associate professor, University of Connecticut School of Law, and co-author, White House BurningIf the tax cuts were bad a decade ago, what has changed since then (for now, leaving aside cyclical issues)? We have had one more decade of aging and health care inflation (and war), so the long-term budget outlook looks considerably worse.Read Post | CommentsLarry Doyle, 03/02/12Author, \u0027I Love You, Beth Cooper,\u0027 \u0027Go Mutants!\u0027 and \u0027Deliriously Happy\u0027Once upon a time, the lessons propagated by Dr. Seuss, then called conservation, anti-totalitarianism, equality, spirituality and trying new foods, were universal virtues we all wanted to teach our children. But now the right has exposed them as socialist scams.Read Post | Comments (32)Dr. Josef Olmert, 03/02/12Adjunct Professor, University of South CarolinaThe build-up to the Obama-Netanyahu summit on Monday, March 5 is in full force. Words like \"crucial\", \"fatal\", \"last-ditch effort\" are in ample supply. Still, I venture to predict that a lot of the drama, whether real or manufactured, is overblown and premature.Read Post | CommentsHeather Higgins, 03/02/12President of the Independent Women\u0027s Voice, serves on various non-profit boards, businesswoman and media commentatorSoup kitchens over art and music programs? Social justice over inner city education? Homeless shelters over medical research? ACORN over the environment? With the thousands of charitable organizations in existence, do we really want these decisions politicized and manipulated?Read Post | CommentsSuzanna de Baca, 03/02/12Vice President, Wealth Strategies, Ameriprise FinancialIn light of Women\u0027s History Month, I took a look back to reflect on the progress women have made on the financial front. We\u0027ve come a long way since my grandmother\u0027s time -- and that is something to celebrate.Read Post | CommentsRobert Reich, 03/02/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Aftershock\u0027Here\u0027s the good news. The economic pie is growing again. Growth in the 4th quarter last year hit 3 percent on an annualized rate. That\u0027s respectable. But here\u0027s the bad news: The share of that growth going to American workers is at a record low.Read Post | Comments (287)Mike Lux, 03/02/12Co-founder and CEO, Progressive StrategiesIf all or even most of this class of women senators were to win in 2012, it would be historic, easily the highest quality group of new women senators ever. Progressives should do everything we can to rally behind them and help carry them to victory.Read Post | CommentsMelani Robinson, 03/02/12Writer, mother, dog-lover, widow, yoga-doer, recent New YorkerThe tone of his texts changed.

That\u0027s the problem with running around 12 different home states, eventually you\u0027re bound to trip and stumble up some familiar front steps.Read Post | CommentsJared Bernstein, 03/02/12Senior Fellow, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesWe may well be unwilling to raise the revenue we need to fight poverty, invest in poor kids, fix up our infrastructure, push back on climate change, and ensure secure retirements for our elderly. But it won\u0027t be because we\u0027re broke.Read Post | Comments (329)Arianna Huffington, 03/01/12I\u0027m delighted to announce the launch of HuffPost Money, a section dedicated to looking at the big financial stories of our time, with an eye on answering the question: how do the day\u0027s headlines affect you and your finances?
