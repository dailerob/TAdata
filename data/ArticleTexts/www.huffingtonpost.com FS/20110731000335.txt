{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"ActorAmericans are caring. And what those who are opposed to raising the debt ceiling are essentially attempting to do is insist that we stop caring. That we stop doing one of the primary things that make this country what it is. That makes us who we are. This bill was coming and you knew it. And if you didn\u0027t see it coming, then you should be very worried. Because you have a real problem. Wake up. We gotta suck it up. Pay this bill. And have a loooooong talk about how we never get here again, while still maintaining our identity as a great country made up of great, caring people.Read Post | CommentsDoug Bandow, 7/30/11Senior Fellow at the Cato InstituteSen.

Our polling demonstrates that while that might have been true in 2006 and 2008, by 2011 this is no longer the case.Read Post | CommentsPaul Brandeis Raushenbush, 7/30/11Senior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostAt first look, His Holiness is intimidating. Well built, self possessed, and with a keen glance, he walks more like a middle weight boxer than one of the most venerated religious figures in Tibetan Buddhism.Read Post | CommentsMartha Infante, 7/30/11History Teacher in Los Angeles, Former Teacher of the YearAs a teacher, I know what good education looks like.

Part of the answer lies with the president -- and his inability or unwillingness to use the bully pulpit to tell Americans the truth, and mobilize them for what must be done.Read Post | CommentsDr. Caroline Cicero, 7/30/11Director, Southern California Health and Aging Public Policy Institute and the Center for Visual GerontologyAs younger person, I never dreamed I would get cancer.

Bernie Sanders, 7/29/11Independent U.S. Senator from VermontThe rich are getting richer. Their effective tax rate, in recent years, has been reduced to the lowest in modern history. Nurses, teachers and firemen actually pay a higher tax rate than some billionaires. It\u0027s no wonder the American people are angry.Read Post | CommentsJesse Kornbluth, 7/30/11Editor of HeadButler.comLife is filled with suffering, but it is also filled with many wonders, like the blue sky, the sunshine, the eyes of a baby.

It also grows because folks at the middle and bottom do worse.Read Post | CommentsDavid Coates, 7/29/11Worrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsIf the general American public is left with the view that this debt ceiling crisis was and is a product of Washington \"politics-as-usual\", as opposed to an unprecedented exception, then the right will already have won, no matter the detail of any compromise that is struck.Read Post | CommentsJoanna Dolgoff, M.D., 7/29/11Pediatrician, Child Obesity Specialist, and Author of Red Light, Green Light, Eat Right!If you are one of the many people in the battle to fight the bulge, you will be pleased to learn that there are actually foods that may help you burn fat.Read Post | CommentsNeal Barnard, M.D., 7/29/11President, Physicians Committee for Responsible MedicineWhile Congress debates how to cure America\u0027s massive debt problem, let me offer a doctor\u0027s prescription: five smart cuts could save taxpayers $383 billion and make Americans healthier at the same time.Read Post | CommentsJohn R.
