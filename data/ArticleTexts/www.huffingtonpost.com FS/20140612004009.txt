{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersIt isn\u0027t often that I give advice that I think is good for the Republican Party. But there is little question that House Majority Leader Eric Cantor\u0027s primary defeat should serve as a warning to the GOP. If they don\u0027t pass comprehensive immigration reform soon, there is more trouble ahead for the party. Passing comprehensive immigration reform now would, in fact, be good for the Republican Party -- and the country. The issue of immigration reform is not going away. The longer it remains unresolved, the easier it is for the party\u0027s extremist wing to use the issue to whip up nativist sentiment against its leaders. Immigration used to be a wedge issue in the Democratic Party. No longer. Now it is a wedge issue within the Republican Party and between the GOP and ordinary Americans.The one thing that does seem certain is that, contrary to the victory claims of hedge fund managers and right-wing editorial writers, no student will gain anything as a result of this decision.Research Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027While Obama has his share of missteps, the responsibility for the catastrophe in Iraq rests with the neocons of the George W. Bush years and the liberal hawks who can\u0027t help but propose war when they see a wrong that needs righting.Executive Director, MIT Center for International StudiesA generation is being victimized by the twin burdens of student debt and youth unemployment. But our nation\u0027s leaders still seem more concerned about the plight of bankers and bank servicers than they do about the plight of bankers\u0027 victims.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourI was fortunate enough to befriend and get inspired by a 76-year-old neighbor who became like a grandmother to me in this challenging time. She worked out every day at a gym, walked at the park, was in fantastic health and told me of the promise for my future if I would just change my mindset.Weight loss coachI\u0027m not surprised when crap is written that perpetuates rape culture. That doesn\u0027t make it less important to call out and it certainly doesn\u0027t make the discussions that crop up around the idiocy less valid. Which brings us to George Will.Writer, reproductive health care access activist and media contributorInstead of victory, we have humiliation. Defeat. And a sweet, sweet vindication that the Republican strategy of stoking up faux-populism, of just saying no, of never proposing a solution to any problem, has blown up so spectacularly because in their gorgeously gerrymandered districts, people -- voters -- have bought the line.Director, TRIO Upward BoundTo see a candidate taking on an incumbent with an astronomical cash advantage, running on a platform in part opposed to money\u0027s influence in the political system, and win is an amazing thing in this day and age. Maybe this is the beginning of a trend in both parties.Senior Fellow at the Bipartisan Policy CenterI have passed the rows of Father\u0027s Day cards when shopping for weeks now. It\u0027s like a knife to my heart every time.Professional speaker, author, and Dallas based philanthropistFor all its claims about efficacy, Pearson is not a very efficient company. For all its claims about valuing education, the only thing Pearson appears to value is profit.Social studies educator, Hofstra UniversityI resolved to operate every day with that recognition of how precious my life and relationships are to me. But have I had unnecessary arguments in my family since then, have I sometimes \"sweated the small stuff,\" or temporarily forgot the lessons I learned from my surgery? Yes. Still human, I\u0027m afraid.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersMy hometown football team has been under fire for many years for using the derogatory term \"redskin\" as its team mascot. As it should. Indeed, the stereotype existed long before the football team -- even before football. But where and how do such mean-spirited and distorted caricatures get started?Author, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027Though improved in some respects, the revived commissions are still characterized by a startling level of secrecy. In an effort to conceal details of defendants\u0027 torture while in CIA custody, the government has designed the commissions to prevent defense teams from obtaining or publicly discussing information about the torture program.Research Associate, Brennan Center for JusticeThe most quoted line from Samuel Wurzelbacher\u0027s letter was \"your dead kids don\u0027t trump my constitutional rights.\" The chutzpah required to write something like that to a total stranger who has just lost a child and does not care about your opinion notwithstanding, the worst thing about that line is that it is essentially the official position of the US government.lincolnmitchell.comThe summer before his death, I asked him what he loved about sunset. He said: \"If you\u0027ve had a rotten day, sunset reminds you that another day is ahead. If you\u0027ve had a great day, sunset reminds you to soak it in. Either way, it\u0027s a win.\"Child and Adolescent Psychotherapist, Parenting ExpertThe message this sends to other Republicans in Congress (both House and Senate) is that this can happen to anyone. The fear this is going to create may become all-encompassing in the House, and possibly even the Senate (if Republicans win control of the chamber this November). The Tea Party sword hanging over their heads is now plain to see.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comWe weren\u0027t supposed to be the ones in a perpetual fight. We were the couple who highlighted and dog-eared our marriage books. My wife was still my dream. Yet, something was missing. We both felt it. And we both wondered why.Husband. father times two. author of Marriage Rebranded. business developer. wannabe cigar aficionado.The Israeli public, more so than their misguided political leaders, must wake up to this fateful reality and decide what kind of future to chart for themselves and for future generations.Senior Fellow, NYU\u0027s Center for Global AffairsIn the ALEC otherworld, actual economics do not count. It\u0027s all about a business-friendly environment. Hello, Third World.Wisconsin State RepresentativeLike a bad penny, this tax repatriation idea just keeps coming back. You know, the one where you offer a bribe to multinational corporations in the form of a big tax cut to \"repatriate\" their foreign earnings.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorEric Cantor was not a sufficiently hardcore fundamentalist? Eric Cantor?Political scientist, Univ. WisconsinYou can\u0027t convince me that I\u0027m immediately complicit in a sexist system for loving makeup, and wearing booty shorts or itty-bitty crop tops.HuffPost Blog FellowMy life\u0027s journey is filled with tales of the improbable becoming inevitable. My road to the White House -- a road less traveled -- stands as a testament.Executive Director, Welcome.USThis is the America of the 21st century, a country divided along lines of morality, where wealth equates to power and the gap between those who have and those who don\u0027t is increasing. I will continue to speak up for those who aren\u0027t able to speak up for themselves.Community activist and studentWhen I say that my material fortune is the result of God\u0027s blessing, it reduces The Almighty to some sort of sky-bound, wish-granting fairy who spends his days randomly bestowing cars and cash upon his followers.Writer, blogger, worship leader and former missionary with the Presbyterian ChurchDuring her reign as Miss World, Linor had to testify against the rapist in a difficult, public trial. When the guilty verdict came in, Linor turned to a news camera in the courtroom and said to all the women in Israel that if she could do it, they could too.Producer, director, documentary filmmakerFilm producer and editorThe 2004 tax holiday only made things worse because companies realized they could get out of paying taxes entirely if they moved profits offshore and held out until the next holiday season. If we do it again, every company will be compelled to move jobs, factories and profit centers out of the country to stay competitive.Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureThe first rule about dating in the Internet Age is that there are no rules about dating in the Internet Age. (Well, maybe just one.)Product Operations Manager at LinkedInJune is Great Outdoors Month, and there is no better time to kick Nature-Deficit Disorder to the curb. So, let me share ten ways to get outside and celebrate the outdoors this month.Director, Nearby Nature at the Sierra ClubThe GI Bill and Pell Grants were among the best investments our country ever made economically. This country would be far better off if we made college easily affordable for everyone who wants to go.Co-Founder, Democracy PartnersI remember one time I worked a game in Los Angeles where I kept going to the non-congested areas with the best angle of the slot and net. Inevitably, I bumped into Wayne Gretzky as he arrived at the same spot.Retired NHL Player and NHL Referee, ECAC Director of Hockey Officiating, Chairman KHL Officiating Evaluation and Discipline CommitteesGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"REELING Race Is On To Replace Him...
