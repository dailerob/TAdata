{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"APSo far, much of Al Gore\u0027s book tour has been drenched in irony, with his castigation of the mainstream media\u0027s fixation on the horserace aspects of politics being met with horserace questions, while his rebuke of our cultural obsession with Britney\u0027s hair, Lindsay\u0027s sex life, and Nicole\u0027s weight has been met with stories obsessing about his weight, his double chin, and his love of clam dip. I\u0027ll be interviewing Gore tomorrow for a HuffPost Q \u0026 A, and I\u0027d love to get your input on the questions you\u0027d like him to address. So put on your best-Larry King suspenders, HuffPosters, and let us know: What do you want to ask Al Gore?READ POST05.24.2007 Donna SmithI wrote a response to Michael Moore\u0027s call for \"health care horror stories\" back in early 2006, and here I was nearly a year later as part of this amazing group of fighters and heroes, traveling on this unknown journey together.READ POST | comments05.24.2007 Harry ShearerWhat this sad spectacle teaches us, I think, is that the Democrats, in their pathetic excuse for strategizing, have replicated one of the basic flaws of the Bush regime.READ POST | comments (71)05.24.2007 David BromwichThe argument that carries most force for ending the war now is a moral argument. It is known to the Democratic opposition, but they have mainly left it unspoken.READ POST | comments (22)05.24.2007 Deepak ChopraThere is no viable peace movement presently, thanks to a thirty-year rise of military-industrial interests. We are in the forefront of inventing new means of mechanized death, including futuristic robot armies.READ POST | comments (17)05.24.2007 Steve ClemonsThe person in the Bush administration who most wants a hot conflict with Iran is Cheney. The person in Iran who most wants a conflict is Ahmadinejad.READ POST | comments05.24.2007 Larry BeinhartI just want to be clear, Hillary voted for the war and now she doesn\u0027t want to get out of it, and you said \u0027Yes.\u0027 Clinton\u0027s Staffer: Yes.READ POST | comments05.24.2007 Aaron BelkinReports about the military\u0027s ongoing dismissal of gay Arabic linguists continue to show what can, and regularly does, happen to even mission-critical servicemembers who are caught up in Don\u0027t Ask, Don\u0027t Tell.READ POST | comments05.24.2007 John KerryBottom line: we support the troops by getting the policy right, and this bill doesn\u0027t do that. We need a deadline to force Iraqis to stand up for Iraq and bring our heroes home, not watered down benchmarks and blank check waivers for this president.READ POST | comments (45)05.23.2007 Marty KaplanSurely, when the president looks at his approval numbers, he, too, must have his own pet theories about why we Americans put him in the cellar. How might he explain our overwhelming rejection of him?READ POST | comments (146)05.24.2007 Danielle CrittendenI always resented my parents\u0027 rules because I so badly wanted to become invisible and blend in, and I had no idea why my parents didn\u0027t want me to be like every other girl -- and that made me incredibly upset.READ POST | comments05.23.2007 Irene KhanFear-driven security strategies have led to a downward spiral of human rights abuse in which no right is sacrosanct and no person safe. Even the global ban on torture is under attack.READ POST | comments05.24.2007 Bill ScherTime and time again, Democratic leaders have sought to accommodate the conservative Republican minority and craft compromise legislation. And in almost every case, it has led to bad or no results.READ POST | comments (23)Lane HudsonDavid SirotaJoan GarryTaylor MarshBob GeigerCarol HoenigEd KosnerMax BlumenthalRobert NaimanDan BrownRJ EskowFrom abcnews.go.comAPFrom washingtonpost.comFrom electronista.comAPParis Hilton and Jessica Simpson claim to actually read books.A Japanese umbrella lets you surf while it rains.Just in time to ride the wave of ping pong hipster popularity, a kung-fu/sports flick mashup about the world of underground table tennis.APAPAPAPLogin to Huffington Post  |  Make Huff Post your Home Page  |  RSS/XML  |  Sitemap  |  Jobs  |  Contact UsCopyright 2007 © HuffingtonPost.com, Inc.   |  User Agreement  |  Privacy  |  Comment Policy  |  Powered by MovableType","h1":"",".title":"","h2":"What Do You Want to Ask Al Gore?The Moon and the Sun Over MiamiThe Congressional Democrats: Only a Best-Case Scenario?The Anti-War PrinciplePeace Through the Back DoorCheney Attempting to Constrain Bush\u0027s Choices on Iran Conflict: Staff Engaged in Insubordination Against President BushProfiles in CowardiceThree More Gay Arabic Linguists GoneRound OneOedipus WrecksSo Dear, Why DO You Want to Dress Like A Skank?Report 2007: The State of the World\u0027s Human RightsThe Failure of CompromiseMessage to America: Tell Congress to vote \u0027No\u0027 on Iraq BillThe Rise of the Dick Cheney DemocratsDick Cheney, Jr. Would Have Had a Nice Ring to ItBloody Tuesday on Capitol HillFour Senators With BallsJust What Does \"Moral Threat\" Mean?A Little Touch of HarryDiary of a Christian TerroristNow the Good News: There Will Be an Up-or-Down Vote in Congress on the WarTanking on The Daily Show: No Child Left Behind DogmaPaul (McCartney) Is Alive - And His New Album\u0027s a MilestoneBakers Oven 5 -David HortonThings That Annoy Me but I Don\u0027t Necessarily Expect Them to Annoy You -Eric AltermanWhat Do You Want to Ask Al Gore? -Arianna HuffingtonCheney\u0027s \"Team\" -Jackson WilliamsOn War Funding, Of Course, the Democrats Had An Option! -William E.
