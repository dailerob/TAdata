{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Institute for America\u0027s FuturePaul Ryan\u0027s Republican budget is revealing, but not flattering. Even by Washington standards, this is a remarkably dishonest document. It claims to be serious, but offers targets that are simply preposterous. It calls for leveling with the American people, but cravenly ducks laying out who will pay for top end tax cuts. Ryan would invest in policing the world and protecting the tax havens of multinationals and turn the Dream into a fantasy. The Ryan budget stands with the 1%. The Congressional Progressive Caucus with the rest of us. You get to choose.Read Post | Comments (173)Marian Wright Edelman, 03/21/12President, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe outcry over Trayvon\u0027s death is absolutely right and just.

Try as he might, Romney won\u0027t be able to twist the Etch-A-Sketch knobs and create a brand new picture.Read Post | Comments (72)Marlo Thomas, 03/21/12Award-winning actress, author, and activistTelevision takes a lot of heat from its critics, but no one can deny that it is a true reflection of the ever-changing times we live in.

Presidential candidate Mitt Romney has said very, very nice things about this budget. In fact, all of the GOP\u0027s leaders have been bragging about it. Since they\u0027re so proud of it, why don\u0027t they tell more people what it really does?Read Post | CommentsCecile Richards, 03/21/12President, Planned Parenthood Action FundAmericans aren\u0027t looking for a president to revoke women\u0027s rights and take away their health care.
