President, Writers Guild of America, East.The House and Senate sprinted off to vacation a few weeks ago with much undone, and thus have returned to a series of difficult deadlines that need to be addressed before the end of the month. Once they\u0027ve put the Iran nuclear deal to bed, kicking and screaming all the way, there are a dozen spending bills that require resolution. But because of right-wing GOP threats insisting on tying the defunding of Planned Parenthood to these appropriations measures, there\u0027s the real possibility -- some say as high as 70 percent -- of deadlock and yet another government shutdown. What\u0027s happening is just the latest virulent iteration of the strategy with which the Republicans have infected Congress from the night Barack Obama became president.I don\u0027t know what die-hard Republicans took away from last night\u0027s GOP primary debate. I saw a dysfunctional family on stage. What dysfunctional families do, in private, is take old grievances and worry them to the bone. In doing so, the original source of pain becomes unrecognizable.Writer and environmental activistFrom immigration to foreign policy, the GOP, via it\u0027s field of presidential candidates, has shown it is as extreme as ever. And, no matter the pundits\u0027 claims or the hopes of some gay activists, that holds true on LGBT rights as well.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostParenting isn\u0027t a game of Simon Says. Most of us have heard the saying \"Do as I say, not as I do.\" It\u0027s easy to encourage my kids to imitate my appropriate responses and then come down on them hard when they imitate my bad ones.Turns out kids are more influenced by actions than our words.Writer, Blogger at www.discoverdiaries.comSo here\u0027s what we learned from the second Republican presidential debate: Carly Fiorina knows how to sell her message -- and how to plant a shiv. Jeb Bush was a prep school pothead. And Donald Trump has neither the inclination nor the capacity to transcend his shtick and become a serious presidential candidate.Professor of Journalism, Northeastern University, BostonThe drug war has failed, and it\u0027s astounding that many on the GOP debate stage still cling to drug war scare tactics reminiscent of Ronald Reagan.Digital Fundraising Manager, Drug Policy ActionThere are two judgments one might make on a position: (1) the arguments put forward in support of it are weak and incoherent, and (2) it is wrong. These judgments are logically independent of one another: it is quite possible that you could find the case being made for a position unpersuasive and still be persuaded of its rightness.Davidson-Kahn Distinguished University Professor and Professor of Law at Florida International University; Floershimer Distinguished Visiting Professor of Law at Cardozo Law SchoolMight it not have been better for the universe as a whole if the Enterprise had never left Earth in the first place and if Earth hadn\u0027t meddled in matters beyond its own solar system?Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogA beautiful woman in a beauty pageant put on baggy clothes and humbly walked across the stage to talk proudly about her career, and her passion for caring for other human beings, and the only thing the women on The View could muster in response were insults grounded in ignorance.Registered nurseFormer CIA Director George Tenet believed the President\u0027s Daily Briefs to be so sensitive that none could be released for publication \"no matter how old or historically significant it may be.\" Yet, yesterday, the CIA declassified and released every PDB produced during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. So what\u0027s in the PDBs?WriterThe Safe Campus Act contains measures that could improve the security of colleges across the nation, but many of its provisions are deeply concerning. The reality is that if this bill passes, it would have the opposite of its intended effect by ultimately decreasing safety on college campuses.President of One Less at UVAVictoria is a second-year student at the University of Virginia and is a campus editor-at-large for the Huffington Post.Many of you have engaged in rhetoric that is feeding a rising tide of hatred toward migrants in the United States and globally. From border walls to mass deportations and guest worker programs, we\u0027ve heard nothing new. But the reality is, many of you count on immigrants every day. In this country, we are interdependent.A campaign to mobilize women in support of common sense immigration policies that keep families togetherIn the past 30 years, Americans have consumed more and more added sugars in the foods they eat and the beverages they drink. Is it any wonder why we have seen obesity become an epidemic in our country?Founder, The Heart2Heart FoundationThe Iran deal\u0027s political survival means many things at once. It signals the decline of AIPAC and the Likud lobby. But it also means something more, something largely missed in the many write-ups of how the victory was forged.Washington Director, MoveOn.org; host, The Good FightCNN was (obviously) baiting everyone into getting into little personal spats, which did happen a number of times, but more than just fireworks this did provoke some interesting back-and-forth exchanges between candidates with differing (even, at times, opposing) viewpoints.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comMy first reaction to finding out about Ahmed Mohamed was fury. It rattled the Mom gene in me making me want to protect this child from the big bad world that was bullying him. I felt astonishment too. Do people seriously look at Muslim kids like they are not human? Like they are monsters?Writer, Activist, MomAmerican anger is real. It\u0027s time to stop pointing fingers solely at the people serving in office. It\u0027s time to start zooming the lens in on the less obvious, yet highly consequential drivers of the dysfunction. Let\u0027s take a look at the rules.Michael Golden is the author of UNLOCK CONGRESS and is a cofounder of One Million Degrees.Cecily\u0027s case is one of the most egregious of the more than 7,000 arrests that were documented during the crackdown on the Occupy movement.Social justice organizer, prison rights advocate, writer and theatre artist.Author, The Occupiers: The Making of the 99 Percent Movement (Oxford University Press, 2015)As a CEO of a company in a competitive industry, I cross my fingers that my competitors will implement wellness programs. Indeed, the more comprehensive their programs, the better it is for me.Author, Surviving Workplace WellnessDon\u0027t worry, you don\u0027t have to worry about this nurse banning your show. After all, I\u0027m the nurse that works 13 hour shifts at two different jobs, the nurse that volunteers once a week teaching prenatal classes to underserved women, the nurse that is still in school (for my Doctorate in NURSING Practice) so I can do better for my patients and my nursing profession.Registered nurse behind the blog Adventures of a Labor Nurse: the Highs and Lows of Labor and DeliverySanders and Trump are driving the political debate. Sanders may be a socialist, but issues he\u0027s raising have broad appeal within the Democratic Party base.Trump has tapped into resentments toward corporate and financial elites that have a long history within the GOP.President, Fiscal Strategies GroupWhatever the electoral result, one may hope that the next government will at least be able to converse with the opposition, whoever ends up being in the former or latter position.Editor-At-Large, HuffPost GreeceAt 52 years old, I\u0027m a daughter, wife, stepmother, sister, aunt and friend. I am all of these things and I am grateful. However, the one thing I am not is a mother. Years ago, I made the decision not to have children. What I failed to do, however, was listen to the voice of my future self.Writer, blogger, eater, traveler, wife, daughter, sister.
