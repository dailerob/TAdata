{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027A year ago, the script for 2016 was sealed -- Clinton II versus Bush III: advantage Clinton. But Jeb Bush’s nomination is far from certain and Bernie Sanders is giving Clinton a run for her money. Indeed, her money is more liability than asset. If Rubio can win over the Republican base, he’d likely be the most trouble for Democrats. In a matchup with Hillary Clinton, Rubio could carry some of those swing states that Democrats color light blue in their presumed lock on the electoral college. The libertarians sort of like him, but aren’t sure he’s one of theirs. Rand Paul is the darling here, but Randian libertarianism (his or Ayn’s) is too goofy for a majority of Americans. Hillary Clinton is a reprise of That Nineties Show, but then so is Jeb Bush. Jebbie would neutralize her many liabilities. Pray for Rand or Jeb, or maybe a vengeful Donald Trump running as an independent. Leave it to Republicans not to nominate someone who can win.Being a passive bystander is not a \"crime.\" If we have any hope at all of putting an end to incidents like these, we need to stop doubting the accusers and start holding rapists, abusers and bullies accountable. What we don\u0027t need to do is point fingers at those who weren\u0027t to blame for their actions.Former member, The Runaways; Entertainment attorneyYour outpouring after my note last week was incredible. Even though I can\u0027t get back to each and every one of you, I want you to know that I\u0027m reading your kind words and that they mean the world to me. Here are just a few to get us started.Public speaker, activist, OlympianThe question of how to proceed on the Greek crisis for pro-austerity European Union leaders, is not about helping Greece\u0027s economy recover, but about enforcing discipline and ensuring obedience to the pro-bank global neoliberal agenda they envision for Europe and the rest of the world.Former Staff Sergeant, Florida National GuardThe GOP has been doing a racist strip tease for decades now, and Trump is just skipping the tease. But it may point to a possible upside. Thanks to gauche clowns like Trump -- not to mention Cliven Bundy, Steve King and others -- the GOP, like the Democratic Party of the 60s, might be forced to reform itself, if only to end the pain.Founder of Boots Road Group LLC, a digital marketing agency for social goodIt\u0027s a sad and shameful truth that 50 years after the bloodshed in Selma -- 50 years after our prized Voting Rights Act -- African Americans have fewer, not more, voting protections today. This is a moral struggle. Once again, we must put on our marching shoes.President, North Carolina Conference of the NAACPAs I went to three of the funerals for the beautiful nine martyrs in Charleston, South Carolina, I addressed the audience and joined our local chapter of National Action Network (NAN) and the NAACP to call for the Confederate flag to come down.President, National Action NetworkWhen we work towards inclusion and acceptance, we win championships.

AthletesThe weakening of a country in this specific area and under these specific circumstances would constitute not just a failure but a choice with grave strategic consequences.Regional Governor of Attica; member of SyrizaAmericans shouldn\u0027t be expected to protect their rich cousins even if the latter were devoted to protecting each other. That the Europeans expect the U.S. to do their job is yet another reason for Americans to say no more.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteThis month is \"Minority Mental Health Awareness Month,\" which is dedicated to raising awareness about mental health challenges --- especially in minority communities. Therefore, as a person of color, I feel compelled to share my journey to help saves lives, as I\u0027ve battled depression for years and was almost another suicide statistic.Author, blogger, project/program leader, business professor, life strategist, inspirational speaker, and radio hostStatistics inundate baseball, allowing for its players\u0027 performance to easily be compared and contrasted. For fans, this can lead to a game of analysis off the field. Let\u0027s combine baseball stats with some data analysis and ask the question: Did the players who most deserve to be called All Stars crack the roster?Associate Professor of Mathematics and Computer Science, Davidson CollegeThe underlying question raised by the Greek financial crisis has been largely ignored, which is whether Greek adoption of the euro -- or even the creation of the Eurozone at all -- was a bad idea to begin with, and one that will not get better with time. This is the question that Germany must fear.President, Fiscal Strategies GroupHaving taken a step back to observe my dogs and other dogs too, the following is what I believe they would convey were they equipped with verbal communication capabilities that we could understand. Dogs would tell you these 10 things...life coach, writer, self-help and business blogger, entrepreneur, owner of Small Steps 2 Big ChangeWhile the profession of architecture discriminates against women, the rest of society objectifies women through the image of architecture. \"She\u0027s built\" is a common expression, and in a 1957 interview journalist Mike Wallace asked Frank Lloyd Wright, \"What do you think of [Marilyn] Monroe as architecture?\" Replied the architect, \"Extremely good.\"Chief Sustainability Officer, Perkins EastmanJeb! Bush, a boy born to wealth and privilege, whose family owns not a home but a compound of dwellings in Kennebunkport, Maine, and whose wife plunked down $25,600 for one pair of earrings, lectured last week that Americans should work longer hours.International President, United SteelworkersIf you have the time to play mobile video games or check your news feed, you have time -- even if it\u0027s five minutes -- to turn off your screen and focus on your emotional health. Whether this is through prayer or meditation or simply sitting quietly in a serene place, the \"mornings\" of our lives can give us the strength from within to achieve optimal mental health.Host, The Dr. Oz Show and Vice-Chair of Surgery at New York Presbyterian Hospital at ColumbiaFounding Chair, Director Emeritus of Action for Healthy KidsScott Walker will announce for president today. After standing for 25 primary and general elections in 25 years, he is poised to take his \"divide and conquer\" brand of politics to the national stage.The Center for Media and Democracy/ALEC ExposedBeing that Atticus Finch doesn\u0027t require that we attend white supremacy meetings, support police brutality or poison our own children with hate. It merely requires that we maintain our innocence amidst the maw of institutionalized racism, and mask our complicity in that system via periodic outrages at current events that clash with the saintly pictures we have painted of ourselves.D.C.-based writer and education activistThrough a community mobilization program that helped with issues such as agricultural production and access to water, Dukale, a poor coffee farmer, had started to lift his family out of poverty.International Development EconomistAcademy Award Nominated ActorNext week on July 14, the NASA spacecraft New Horizons will have completed its nine-year journey to Pluto. There is no telling what we will discover when we get there, but it will certainly be both alien and exciting!Astronomer, National Institute of AerospaceIn reality, there\u0027s nothing \"lone\" about drone warfare. Think of the structure for carrying out Washington\u0027s drone killing program as a multidimensional pyramid populated with hundreds of personnel and so complex that just about no one involved really grasps the full picture.Author, Halliburton\u0027s Army: How A Well-Connected Texas Oil Company Revolutionized the Way America Makes WarHere we are, only a few months after the new Congress took up residence on Capitol Hill, with a suddenly resurgent president. Just in the last few weeks, President Obama has been scoring a surprising number of domestic and foreign policy victories. His critics are cowed.Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogTheir dreams don\u0027t focus on figuring out the answers to existential questions, pining for fancy gadgets or even changing the majority of their day-to-day circumstances. They\u0027re modest dreams. They\u0027re dreams that would allow them to keep working and leading the lives that they\u0027re already leading.Kiva FellowFor my whole adult life, I\u0027d felt bad about not dressing better. But I\u0027d also refused to give up ratty clothes or buy nice ones. I\u0027d pushed myself to obey contradictory internal commands: dress well, but don\u0027t throw things away or spend money. Finally, I broke free of the double bind.Like Dory from Finding Nemo: a kind heart, enthusiasm, \u0026 a tendency to forget what I know about the way home. Writing helps me to remember.With the nationwide release of Amy, the bio-doc of Amy Winehouse, I am reminded of the all too often fatal cost of fame. After seeing the movie, there is something I want to shout from the highest peak so that people can it hear this loud and clear: \"Fame can kill you.\"Licensed clinical psychologist, leading mindfulness meditation teacher, specialist in celebrity mental health, and activist in contemporary humanistic psychologyGiven the broad contours of the historic $18.7 billion \"agreement in principle\" announced this month between the U.S. Department of Justice, Gulf states and BP to resolve government claims from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill disaster, there is cause for optimism.Professor and conservation biologist, Oasis Earth (www.oasis-earth.com)It\u0027s such a slap in the face to inquire about one of the most emotionally charged and highly personal decisions in a person\u0027s life.writer, musician, dog mom, yogi, military spouse, runner, mermaid, laughter captain, and educatorChapo Guzman\u0027s escape further undermines the already wounded credibility of Enrique Peña Nieto and his security apparatus. But more than that, it underlines the futility of the war on drugs and its reliance on taking out \"kingpins\" while never questioning the flawed prohibition policies that drive the whole bloody mess.Director of Mexico program for Global ExchangeFor France, European integration is a goal to be achieved regardless of the cost. For Germany, although European unity figures prominently on its agenda, the speed and depth of European integration must be analyzed pragmatically, weighing the benefits and the costs.Director of the Lauder Institute at the Wharton SchoolMandatory drug-sentencing minimums that everyone from President Obama to Ted Cruz have railed against, are commonly viewed now as unjust law and ineffective policy.
