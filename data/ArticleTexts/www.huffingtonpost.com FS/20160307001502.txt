{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, if you thought the floor had been reached in the level of debate on the Republican side, you\u0027d be mistaken. An extraordinary Thursday began with Mitt Romney proclaiming \"Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud\" - though he stopped short of joining the growing #NeverTrump movement among Republicans. Hours later, the Republican debate turned into a literal penis-measuring contest, as opposed to the metaphorical ones of previous debates. \"I guarantee you there is no problem,\" said Trump.

But the most extraordinary moment came at the end. After attacking Trump as a fraud and a danger to the country, when asked if they\u0027d support him as nominee all three of the other candidates said, in effect, Yeah, sure, no problem.

That needs to change.Author of Don\u0027t Think of an Elephant! | UC Berkeley Professor of Linguistics | Founder of Reframe AmericaWelcome to yet another manufactured media feud that is needed to feed websites and empty air time.Model, designer, an author, businesswoman, public speakerAlthough some measure of judicial restraint is essential to the legitimacy of constitutional interpretation, even conservatives recognize that judicial restraint in all cases would seriously abdicate a fundamental responsibility that the Framers themselves entrusted to the judiciary.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoAs Hollywood celebrates its biggest night, I plan to lead the charge for inclusion and representation of all groups in the media. That way, in the very near future we can all look back and take pride in a banner year of diversity for everyone in our industry, regardless of race, creed, orientation, ability or gender.Actor, Comedian\"Read the small print\" is sound advice before buying car insurance or signing for a reverse mortgage touted in a late-night infomercial.

Hellerstedt, the momentous abortion rights case from Texas now before the Supreme Court.Senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of LawLike a professional magician who turns on his fellows and gives away the tricks of his craft, Donald Trump has exposed the folly of what used to pass as modern conservatism.Professor, historian, authorThe Harvard Gazette has released a series of articles on inequality in America.

But she never did.Author, \u0027Dangerous Ground\u0027Your education is an investment in your future. It should help you get ahead. Right now, it\u0027s doing the opposite. It\u0027s not enough to make college more affordable -- we need to help people with the debt they already have.Democratic candidate for President; Former Secretary of State, U. S. Senator and First LadyContinued business-as-usual fossil fuel emissions will begin to make low latitudes inhospitable. If accompanied by multi-meter sea level rise, resulting forced migration and economic disruption could be devastating. Even global warming as small as 2°C, sometimes called a safe guardrail, may have large effects.Climatologist and Adjunct Professor, Columbia University Earth InstituteThe identity politics of whiteness, intensified by a time when there have been no economical alternatives on the table, may have closed that door for tens of millions. Whether you can bring yourself to care about them or not, that is a bad end to a bad story.Professor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027Could Donald Trump have been stopped by the insiders and GOP establishment who today are wringing their hands and are in full on war to try and take him out? In looking back, I note five missed windows of opportunity.Political strategistDepression is real. It can\u0027t be swept under the rug. We need to deal with it. Now. Before it\u0027s too late.

I\u0027ve taken a stand on these issues, and I\u0027m not apologetic about it, but I think I need to explain to people where I\u0027m coming from.President, Eurasia Group; Author, \u0027Superpower: Three Choices for America’s Role in the World\u0027This Women\u0027s History Month, I refuse to celebrate a white feminism that keeps women of color on the margins.

The California Realm of the North Carolina-based Loyal White Knights Klan (LWK) group was supposed to come to a park for an \"informational walk.\" As soon as the LWK arrived, the street adjoining the park turned into a violent maelstrom of knives, wooden planks, metal rods, fists, feet and blood.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityIf the government has its way, then it will have won the authority to turn American tech companies against their customers and, in the process, undercut decades of advances in our security and privacy.Ford Foundation Fellow, ACLU’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology ProjectThe media can act shocked about Trump failing to quickly and very clearly denounce David Duke and the KKK and their support for him, but they didn\u0027t seriously ask the more important question: Why do the advocates of white supremacy like and advocate for Donald Trump?Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
