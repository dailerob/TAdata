{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"At the heart of Mitt Romney\u0027s campaign is the competence he demonstrated while running Bain Capital. But this week at the heart of his campaign were Romney\u0027s claims about having not actually run Bain -- at least not from 1999 to 2002. What makes this particular time period significant is that during these years the private equity firm managed companies that were \"pioneers\" in outsourcing American jobs and steered multiple others into bankruptcy. The Obama campaign framed the inconsistency as \"a big Bain lie\" and suggested the GOP candidate had either lied to the SEC or to the American people. Romney insists he left Bain in 1999 to run the 2002 Winter Olympics. This week he takes the gold medal for his marathon sprint from his own record. You can tell he\u0027s been training: he shaved three years off his time at Bain.Read Post | Comments (241)John Cusack, 07/11/12Makes filmsThrough Phil Stutz\u0027s and Barry Michels\u0027 approach, which draws in part on the Jungian principle of active imagination, cognitive behavior therapy, and spiritual precepts unbuckled from religion, the problems and pain of life become the foundation for creating meaning and transformation.Read Post | Comments (118)Marian Wright Edelman, 07/13/12President, Children\u0027s Defense FundThis year, let\u0027s all be alert.
