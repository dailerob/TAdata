{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"APAPAPAPAgain and again, President Bush has insisted that he\u0027s running the war by listening to his military commanders. But that\u0027s clearly not what\u0027s happening. For months, those commanders, Gen. Abizaid and Gen. Casey, have been unwavering in their opposition to sending more troops to Iraq, but the surge is moving forward anyway. Making matters worse, the generals are now providing cover for Bush by caving to White House pressure and acting like they support the move. If there were ever a time for America\u0027s military leaders to tell us the truth as opposed to keeping their mouths shut while waiting for this administration\u0027s version of the gold watch -- the Medal of Freedom bestowed on those that play the good soldier and go along with the program -- this is surely that time.READ POST | comments (117)12.29.2006 Steve ClemonsSenator Lieberman just spent 10 days in the Middle East and still does not get it. He\u0027s penned an op-ed calling for more deployed American troops in Iraq.READ POST | comments (14)12.29.2006 Jon SoltzI have never supported hard timelines in Iraq, I don\u0027t even think we should \"leave tomorrow,\" but to increase forces just shows blatant disregard for the troops in harms way.READ POST | comments12.29.2006 Josh SilverThe Democrats stood firm in the face of enormous pressure, and won concessions that have transformed the debate over the future of the Internet.READ POST | comments12.29.2006 Jonathan RintelsThis is the second stinging defeat in two months for Whitacre and AT\u0026T, which spent hundreds of millions of dollars in an unsuccessful Mike McCurry-led disinformation campaign.READ POST | comments12.28.2006 John McQuaidI\u0027m a bit torn. I like Edwards, and I like it when national attention is focused on New Orleans, even if it\u0027s a little off-point.READ POST | comments (11)12.29.2006 Taylor MarshA Democratic candidate for president goes down to the Lower 9th Ward of NOLA to announce his candidacy and people are complaining that he didn\u0027t clean up the mess while he was down there.READ POST | comments (23)12.28.2006 Harry ShearerNew Orleans figures into the announcement as a \"see what I mean?\" support for Edwards\u0027 revived \"two Americas\" slogan. But the people being bedeviled by problems in New Orleans belie that neat dichotomy.READ POST | comments (46)12.28.2006 Michelle PileckiBefore he turned to politics, didn\u0027t Mr. Edwards take a great deal of interest in defective products and the havoc they wreak? But he takes no interest in the alleged culpability of the US Army Corps of Engineers?READ POST | comments (19)12.28.2006 Scott KestersonSadly, Afghanistan feels as if we have lost sight of our purpose, and in so doing, we have lost touch with the soldiers that are here.READ POST | comments12.28.2006 Michelle Kraus and Dave JohnsonThis is the issue that can and should reach beyond partisan issues and be based on solid facts, and business and social principles - not politics.READ POST | comments12.28.2006 Raymond J.
