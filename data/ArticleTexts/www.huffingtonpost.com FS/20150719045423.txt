{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, the historic nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers was finalized. Provisions include reducing Iran\u0027s stockpile of uranium by 98 percent, IAEA inspections for 25 years, and a \"snap-back\" clause that would quickly reimpose sanctions if Iran breaks the deal. President Obama said it\u0027s \"our best means of assuring that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon,\" and pointed out that critics haven\u0027t presented an alternative. But that didn\u0027t stop them from sounding off. Speaker Boehner called it \"a bad deal\" that \"blows my mind.\" And Dick Cheney asked, \"What the hell is the president thinking?\" As the debate over the deal continues, it\u0027s worth noting that many of its most bellicose critics were among the biggest cheerleaders for the invasion of Iraq -- the worst foreign policy disaster in U.S. history. Their opposition might well be the ultimate sign the agreement is in America\u0027s best interest.America has never formally acknowledged and apologized for the unspeakable evil of slavery. So I am asking Republicans and Democrats alike to apologize to the American people. Our continued refusal to apologize for slavery still shames and divides our nation. It is past the time to heal.Actor, author of 10 books and a book of poems \"Life Could Be Verse” published by HCI, December 2014Being a passive bystander is not a \"crime.\" If we have any hope at all of putting an end to incidents like these, we need to stop doubting the accusers and start holding rapists, abusers and bullies accountable. What we don\u0027t need to do is point fingers at those who weren\u0027t to blame for their actions.Former member, The Runaways; Entertainment attorneyThose who oppose deals like this often proclaim a binary world of simple good and evil, which we don\u0027t have -- and believing so is a dangerous illusion.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersFotini Markopoulou is co-founder of Team Turquoise, a wearable tech company that uses research in psycho-physiology to create technology that changes how we perceive, feel and behave.

Even though I can\u0027t get back to each and every one of you, I want you to know that I\u0027m reading your kind words and that they mean the world to me. Here are just a few to get us started.Public speaker, activist, OlympianNo plausible and persuasive argument has yet been offered as to why we and our allies would be better off without this agreement. Until it is offered, this agreement profoundly requires Congressional approval.United States Senator (Ret.)The explosion of tech and screens into the lives of children is outrageously obvious to me as a pediatrician.Pediatrician, Boston Children\u0027s Hospital, Harvard Medical SchoolNow that a cycle has run its course and it feels like a whole century has passed since the Sunday of the referendum, I dare ask the sacrilegious question: What would have possibly happened had we voted \"YES\"?Editor-At-Large, HuffPost GreeceThe recent spotlight on systematic racial profiling and police brutality against Black boys and men has exposed a painful truth long known in the Black community: just about every Black youth and man seems to have a story about being stopped by the police.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundGreece had to be saved. It had to be saved from that growing segment of European opinion that was sick of seeing a member country place its own legitimacy over that of 18 other members. It had to be saved from itself and from the sentiment that Greece was being prescribed remedies that were akin to a cup of hemlock. But most of all, it had to be saved -- imperatively -- for three reasons.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.Isn\u0027t it about time we reimagined what being old is? We can start with who we call \u0027elderly,\u0027 and maybe we could stop assuming that every 66-year-old is going to retire the very moment they reached full retirement age.Senior Writer/Columnist, The Huffington PostScott Walker thought he was playing a deft game. But this week it blew up in spectacular fashion as Walker stepped on the Ben Carson third rail and blatantly implied gay men are predators who can\u0027t be trusted around children. You\u0027d think in 2015 this kind of blatant defamation would be banished from politics.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostThe Internet is a writer\u0027s friend and a writer\u0027s enemy. It gives us community and support in an otherwise very solitary profession. It\u0027s a generous platform, especially for writers. But the Internet is also a big problem for writers.Laura Munson is a New York Times best-selling author and the founder of Haven RetreatsThe fact that her death occurred at the start of Obama\u0027s week-long criminal-justice policy offensive is profoundly depressing. That Monday, Obama used a pen to free 46 federal prisoners, but off-camera, Sandra Bland was suffocating under decades of racial bias and bigotry.Author, \u0027Tear Down This Myth\u0027Andy Cohen is messy. We know this. That said, he got too messy labeling 16-year-old actress Amandla Stenberg \"Jackhole of the Day\" on Sunday night\u0027s episode of Watch What Happens Live. What\u0027s worse, Laverne Cox and Andre Leon Talley, two Black folk, sat there and let that slide.Author, \u0027Don\u0027t Waste Your Pretty\u0027There are more solar workers than actors in California, according to Bureau of Labor numbers crunched by the Solar Foundation, which also counted more solar jobs in Texas than there are ranchers.Oscar-nominated actor, climate change activistI\u0027m glad that we had to hear each other\u0027s voices and have the nerve to ask each other things outright rather than hiding behind a cell phone screen, typing away. I\u0027m glad that we spent our first Christmas apart falling asleep on the phone with each other.Homeschooling, ballerina mommy of three with baby 4 on board, sharing her parenting adventure at Beyond MommyingJohn F. Kennedy, licking his wounds from the Bay of Pigs debacle in Cuba, told a press conference that \"Victory has a hundred fathers. Failure is an orphan.\" This piquant observation comes to mind as many of us celebrate the most historic foreign-policy achievement of the Obama presidency, and possibly the most important \"victory\" for global peace in the last three decades.Executive Director, MIT Center for International StudiesIn early June, the ACLU commissioned a nationwide poll of registered voters who are likely to vote in the 2016 presidential election. The results, released Wednesday, demonstrate that we have arrived at a bipartisan moment where majorities of Americans no longer believe our criminal justice system serves the common good.Director, ACLU Campaign for Smart JusticeThe Greek debt crisis offers another illustration of Wall Street\u0027s powers of persuasion and predation, although the Street is missing from most accounts. The crisis was exacerbated years ago by a deal with Goldman Sachs, engineered by Goldman\u0027s current CEO, Lloyd Blankfein.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027While we sat by the fire that night, I thought about how our Twitter and Facebook feeds were trapped in their digital prison all day, and a spool of memories unwound in my uncluttered mind.

I have to close the laptop, put down the phone, and look inward and to the loved ones surrounding me. There I can find meaning in the joys and challenges of my actual life.Wife, mom, special education teacher, recovering perfectionist, dark chocolate addict, blogger at zachellamom.com/wp.As I went to three of the funerals for the beautiful nine martyrs in Charleston, South Carolina, I addressed the audience and joined our local chapter of National Action Network (NAN) and the NAACP to call for the Confederate flag to come down.President, National Action NetworkSo, you\u0027re headed out on a family vacation this summer. Great news! But are you sure? Are you sure it\u0027s a vacation? You might want to think about that for a minute.Writer. Blogger. Recovering Nail Biter. Humorist. Wearer of Funny Hats. Moon Lover.The nuclear deal with Iran is to be welcomed -- mainly because Obama allowed himself to be trapped in a position where the only alternative was confrontation with the prospect for war. The strategic implications, if not accompanied by wider policy adjustments here and in the region, are marginal at best.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghGawker manufactured a story that accused someone of rape -- not to mention other intimate partner abuse -- apparently for clicks and giggles, then delivered it over four posts spaced more than a month apart.
