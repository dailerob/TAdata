And this year, we\u0027re doubling down on user engagement by inviting you all to submit the story of the \"Game Changer in your life\" -- and get a shot at winning a trip to New York to join us at an event to celebrate all our Game Changers. So check out the slideshows and start voting!Read Post | Comments (168)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 9/21/11Author, \u0027Our Fathers Ourselves. Daughters, Fathers, And The Changing American Family\u0027Note to Michele Bachmann. Here\u0027s a suggestion from someone you will never invite to lunch. What if you used your presence to speak for women who so far have been invisible and irrelevant to the message planners? These are real issues out there.

We\u0027ll keep it simple, and not even wander into the economics of it. Human beings make mistakes. Therefore, having humans run devices that can kill literally millions of people is a mistake. A bad idea.Read Post | Comments (43)Mary Mapes, 9/21/11Veteran TV reporter, on the team that broke the Abu Ghraib scandalOur system, too often, is as fundamentally unfair as we are -- as cruel as any one person can be, as riddled with hypocrisy, confusion and mistakes. Tonight, as prayers are delivered and hopes are dashed, we should resolve to finally do something about our addiction to execution.Read Post | Comments (15)Randy Turner, 9/21/11English teacher in Joplin, MissouriIf Secretary of Education Arne Duncan steps into my 8th grade classroom when he visits tornado-stricken Joplin, he will have an opportunity to see a man-made disaster that he made possible.Read Post | CommentsRussell Simmons, 9/21/11Founder of GlobalGrind.comA man, a black American man, Troy Davis, is about to be killed in Georgia tonight even though there is reasonable doubt about his guilt.Read Post | Comments (345)Jennifer Gauvain, 9/21/11Author, How Not To Marry The Wrong GuyWe can rationalize anything. But when we talk ourselves into dating the wrong guy or girl -- that\u0027s where the potential for lifelong heartache begins.Read Post | Comments (283)Michael Shank, 9/21/11Conflict AnalystThat the economics of peace have had such a hard time prevailing in policy conversations is, in part, because the dominant language, lobbies, and learning environments are all geared toward the mechanics of war.Read Post | CommentsTrina Read, 9/21/11Relationship and sexual health expertAt least once a year media grabs the next \"is the sexual morality of our young women in peril?\" headline and runs with it. Unfortunately, this results in yet another young generation of women who suffer the burden of carrying a ton of shame about their sexuality for the rest of their lives.Read Post | Comments (13)Marianne Schnall, 9/21/11Writer/InterviewerI want these young women to have the confidence that whatever they have been doing will prepare them in a very unique way for the challenges ahead.

It\u0027s a darn good movie about an interesting subject that honors its subject matter without inflating its importance. It\u0027s not a grand-slam home-run hitter, but it does reliably get on base.Read Post | CommentsWill Marshall, 9/20/11President and Founder, Progressive Policy InstituteWhy are Palestinians devoting their diplomatic energies to scoring purely symbolic points at Turtle Bay?Read Post | Comments (133)Marcia Sirota, 9/21/11PsychiatristMaybe some people like to feel superior by laughing at the characters on these shows, but by choosing to waste their time on such drivel, they inadvertently demonstrate their own lack of discernment.Read Post | Comments (47)Patrick Ruffini, 9/21/11Partner at Engage; Veteran of three Presidential campaignsWhat happened to the idea that running for President required enormous lead time to build the kind of name recognition necessary to dominate the evening news?Read Post | CommentsGustavo Arellano, 9/21/11Staff writer with OC WeeklyArellano answers the questions, \"Am I Supporting the Mexican Drug Cartels if I Smoke Pot?
