{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027You may recall a campus slogan from another era, \"Hey, hey. Ho, ho. Western civ. has got to go.\" That was at Stanford University in 1987, part of a wave of demands to limit traditional courses featuring dead while males, in favor of cultural pluralism. Sure enough, many colleges a generation later have more varied courses. Today, however, there are people out there who feel that western civilization really does have to go -- not the courses but the thing itself. And they seem to be gaining. Call me sentimental, call me privileged, but I have a certain fondness for western civilization. Let me count the ways. I like the rule of law. I like the Enlightenment sensibility that a wide variety of religions and viewpoints must be accommodated. I like the connection of free speech and free inquiry to the scientific method -- giving reason, logic and evidence priority over faith.The rise of \"independent contractors\" is the most significant legal trend in the American workforce -- contributing directly to low pay, irregular hours and job insecurity. It\u0027s become a race to the bottom.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Penn\u0027s unwarranted remark is as obscene as questioning, \"who gave blacks the right to vote?\" or \"who gave women the right to pursue an education?\"Student and campus-editor-at-large, Florida State UniversityDo we need annual testing to tell us that poverty in childhood has lifelong consequences in health, education, and economic opportunity? Do we need annual testing to tell us that communities with high concentrations of minority students from impoverished households struggle on test-based measures?Director of Secondary Education and Secondary Special Education Teacher Preparation, Seton Hall UniversityJust weeks ago, the Washington Post described Scott Walker as the first \"it\" candidate of the 2016 presidential races, but after stumbling over \"truth,\" evolution, and whether or not the President is a Christian or loves America, Walker is getting ready to change the topic.The Center for Media and Democracy/ALEC ExposedLast week the nation was treated to the sad and embarrassing spectacle of Jeb Bush, mollycoddled scion to an empire of failure, proclaiming that \"I\u0027m my own man.\" Here\u0027s a simple rule of thumb: Anyone who has to say he\u0027s his own man, or woman, isn\u0027t.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourNever did I ever expect Lady Gaga to do a medley of songs from The Sound of Music. Then when she introduced and embraced Dame Julie Andrews, I kept thinking \"Pop royalty meets actual royalty.\"Lawyer; writer; film, TV, and pop-culture aficionado; social media expert and correspondent; awards show enthusiast; and big dreamer.As controversy surrounding Bill O\u0027Reilly and his previous claims of harrowing \"combat\" journalism escalates, this would be the moment when most news organizations would step in and announce that an internal review was underway to ascertain the truth. But not Fox News.Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaThe U.S. media has a China fever, which results in typically feverish reports that don\u0027t take the pulse of the country or its leader. In the process, so much is missed.Roving correspondent for the Asia TimesThe host of the awards has no place contradicting the view of a documentary filmmaker who has just spoken eloquently of the subject of her film.Paul J. Tillich Professor of Theology and Culture, Emeritus Union Theological Seminary; Author; TheologianWe have a big problem: the Israeli Prime Minister wants to drag the US into a proxy war for Israel against Iran, and Jews are likely to get the blame when that war turns out be an even bigger disaster than the US war in Iraq.Editor, Tikkun MagazineI know I am supposed to be the teacher, the mother. But the truth is, you have taught me more than I\u0027m sure I have managed to teach you.Blogger at Everything and Nothing from Essex- deannajsmith.comThere is one married lesbian couple in Texas right now. Probably. Last week a judge allowed Sarah Goodfriend and Suzanne Bryant to obtain a marriage license, citing urgency after Sarah was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. The ruling applies only to this one couple. And according to state officials, that\u0027s still one couple too many.Writer, photographer, explainer of the strange and wonderfulThe billionaire Republican Governor of Illinois, Bruce Rauner, injected himself into ceremonies in Chicago last week presided over by the city\u0027s Democratic mayor and the nation\u0027s Democratic president.International President, United SteelworkersContinue to rise and lift up your sisters and brothers who are also experiencing discrimination and abuse. Continue to strive for excellence in all of your endeavors, undaunted by the bad behavior of others.Chief Executive Officer, The King CenterThe Academy Awards for me was a surprise, notably in that I mostly enjoyed Neil Patrick Harris\u0027 performance.Screenwriter; former member, WGAW Board of Directors; former U.S. Senate aideAt tonight\u0027s Oscars we\u0027ll no doubt see some familiar faces winning that coveted gold statuette. It\u0027s no secret that these sparkling little men aren\u0027t 100 percent gold -- they\u0027re only coated in 24-carat gold -- so that makes it harder to figure out how much gold they actually contain. Luckily math comes to the rescue.Mathematician, professor at Wellesley College, and author of Everyday Calculus.Would it be easier for the president to hop aboard the \"let\u0027s kill Islamic terrorists\" bandwagon? Of course. It would be popular, understandable and a political rallying cry for a president who could use all the support he can get. That he refuses to take that route in his public comments is, even if you think he is wrong, an example of moral courage.Founder, Leadership for a Responsible SocietyIn late December, in the shadow of the hospital where my daughter was born, we buried my oldest brother. He was nine years older than I, and he led a troubled life. But as I said at his graveside, mustering the few words I could before breaking down, \u0027You made me laugh. You were my brother. I love you.\u0027Journalist/ProducerAs we have found so many times before, while current challenges may have brought out the worst in some, it has also created the opportunity to bring good people together to support each other.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027If \"Black lives\" REALLY MATTER, then we must acquire and exercise the right to vote to insure that we elect officials who will impartially administer the laws and manage those State and Municipal Agencies having jurisdiction over our children and our own daily lives.Diversity Visiting Professor, University of San Francisco; and Scholar Writer in Residence, MLK, Jr. Institute, Stanford UniversityFor 50 years Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) has been the primary source of federal funding targeted to schools to serve poor children. Sadly, from the beginning states didn\u0027t keep their end of the bargain.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundAnyone can suggest that you read this year\u0027s Oscar page to screen books (and you should, because they\u0027re all great), but we\u0027re here to share with you some books becoming movies this year that we think have Oscar written all over them.eBooks providerThis week, the White House held a Summit on Combating Violent Extremism. Walking through the Albuquerque airport on the day of the Summit, I was surprised to see a TV headline ask the question, \"Is ISIS a religious group?\" It is an absurd question. Of course it is a religious group.President, Fiscal Strategies GroupThe point is sexual orientation varies amongst almost everyone. It\u0027s fine if you\u0027ve known that you are straight for your entire life. But it\u0027s also fine for people who aren\u0027t straight to know that for just as long. Or to have just realized it the other day.Student, University of Michigan-Ann ArborThey\u0027re both famous, divisive, demagogic headline hunters and racial accelerants -- and problems for their respective parties. Lowry and LaMarche discuss Rudy\u0027s slam that Obama doesn\u0027t \"love America\" and GOP criticism that he has the wrong phrasing and policy about ISIS.Host, \u0027Both Sides Now\u0027With his last-minute decision, Judge Hanen has blocked nearly 5 million aspiring Americans from getting right with the law, working and paying taxes, and living free from the constant fear of deportation and separation from their families.Working to empower the Latino community nationwide.Here are eight steps to take right now for more balance and less stress as you work toward crossing some major milestones.Things happen all the time that we can\u0027t control. People let us down. Things don\u0027t turn out the way we want them to. And, sometimes -- almost always -- all you can do is laugh, and feel better than you did before. Thank you Harris Wittels, not only for laughing, but for not being scared to. I hope it\u0027s okay if we laugh too.student, writer, friend.CHIP is a success and millions of kids are healthier because of it. Every state has taken advantage of CHIP and that\u0027s one reason the uninsured rate for children has dropped dramatically since its enactment.
