{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Davidson-Kahn Distinguished University Professor and Professor of Law at Florida International UniversityIn King v. Burwell, decided last Thursday, the Supreme Court has once again (no doubt inadvertently) given us a lesson in the philosophy of language. The dispute in the case is over the meaning of the phrase \"exchange established by the state.\" Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the majority, argues that the phrase can and should be read to include an exchange established by the federal government. He explains that \"exchange established by the state\" is ambiguous because when read in context (as he proceeds to do) it means something different than it does when read in isolation. Justice Scalia retorts that by the logic of such a reading, \"everything is ambiguous.\" That\u0027s both right and not right.Right now, too many Americans are working long days for less pay than they deserve. That\u0027s partly because we\u0027ve failed to update overtime regulations for years -- and an exemption meant for highly paid, white collar employees now leaves out workers making as little as $23,660 a year -- no matter how many hours they work.44th President of the United StatesDonald Trump has no one to blame but himself for the ongoing controversy. If he had shown a basic level of respect for Latinos, he would not be facing growing outrage in the Hispanic community. Maybe the title of his next book should be \"How To Lose Friends and Deport People.\"Attorney; USA Today Columnist, NBCNews.com ContributorIt is true that in a referendum, the people speak. But they don\u0027t say much. Just a \"yes\" or a \"no.\" That\u0027s why the important part of a referendum isn\u0027t the answer.

Or the events of the week could energize the haters.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027In response to sexual violence, we too often hear the hateful and self-serving phrase \"they were asking for it.\" Now, in the wake of mass shootings, gun apologists have taken to publicly and loudly importing this shameful, victim-blaming tactic.Executive Director, Coalition to Stop Gun ViolenceTsipras is what all leaders should actually be like. We have simply become so accustomed to seeing things through the warped prism of political expedience, that democracy as it should be appears twisted.Greek-born, Alex Andreou is a lawyer-turned-economist-turned-actor-turned-political blogger and consequently disorientedThe lead lawyer urging the Supreme Court to overturn this important public safety rule was Michigan Solicitor General Aaron Lindstrom, representing a group of conservative-dominated states.

Only then can those in despair envision a future in which they and their children live useful lives as contributing members of our society.Public historian in residence, Bard College, and former director, Franklin D.

Swift, stern punishment of those found to be guilty -- in the short-term. The maturing of attitudes toward human sexuality in the long run.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghAs most people know, economists are good at rewriting history. We have seen this in the last few years as the collapse of the housing bubble and the ensuing downturn has been turned into one of those unavoidable tragedies that could not have been prevented.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027When it comes to marriage equality in the United States, the church too often has been on the wrong side of history.Pastor of Christ Church: Portland, an open, active \u0026 inclusive faith community for God\u0027s glory \u0026 neighbor\u0027s good.New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is the latest Republican to announce he is running for president.

Greeks now face the prospect of prolonged capital controls, severe political unrest and eventually a confiscation of ordinary citizens\u0027 savings to finance a government\u0027s withdrawal from the world.Executive Director, GreenmantleEuropean Director, GreenmantleI never originally intended to make a public post about my private life.

The biggest mistake in American policy, foreign and domestic, is looking at everything as war. When a war mentality takes over, it chooses the weapons and tactics for you.Retired lieutenant colonel (USAF)A crucial dilemma will shortly face the United States in the United Nations, where a resolution is expected to be introduced in the Security Council by France that will seek to set the parameters for a permanent settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Associate Research Professor of Israel Studies and Executive Director of the Gildenhorn Institute for Israel Studies at the University of MarylandGraduate Professor of History at the University of California RiversideThe only sensible way forward is to cancel the Greek debt (or at least substantial swathes of it) and for the international community to support Greece\u0027s democratically elected government to rebuild its society and its economy.Labour MP for Islington NorthThe income gap between poor minority and middle-class white communities continues to widen.

Making the world a better place...one act of kindness at a time.If Democrats simply vote based on their value system, Bernie Sanders can easily win the presidency.
