{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, the supposedly lame duck Congress and shellac-shocked president came together and produced a flurry of good legislation. The repeal of Don\u0027t Ask, Don\u0027t Tell is another step on our path towards a more perfect union. The START Treaty should have been a no-brainer (is there anyone outside of Tehran or Pyongyang in favor of more nukes?) but is nonetheless a solid national security success. And the passage of a diminished bill covering the health costs of 9/11 first responders is, literally, the least we could do for them. So the president has earned his vacation. But when he gets back from Hawaii, he needs to make sure that he puts job creation and the plight of the nearly 27 million Americans out of work or underemployed front and center, and doesn\u0027t get caught up in the political and financial establishment\u0027s focus on the deficit. Let\u0027s not rearrange the furniture while the economic house goes up in flames.Read Post | CommentsHarry Shearer, 12.23.2010Just a guyAssange is this season\u0027s Obama: a man from nowhere, suddenly burst on the scene with a message of hope -- and smart and media-savvy enough to out-think his questioners and the audience.Read Post | CommentsBillie Jean King, 12.19.2010Founder, Women’s Sports FoundationYears from now we may look back on Saturday\u0027s repeal of \"don\u0027t ask, don\u0027t tell\" and wonder why it was such as big deal. It should have been a no-brainer.Read Post | CommentsAl Franken, 12.20.2010U.S. Senator, MinnesotaThis Tuesday is an important day in the fight to save the Internet.
