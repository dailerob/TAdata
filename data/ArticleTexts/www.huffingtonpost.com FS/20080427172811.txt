{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOThis week featured the through-the-looking glass moment when Bill Clinton accused Barack Obama of having \"played the race card on me,\" then denied saying it just a few hours later -- even though he\u0027d said it on the radio. I know Toni Morrison called Clinton the first black president, but that\u0027s taking things too far.

And John McCain\u0027s \"gas tax holiday\" is basically economic crystal meth.Read Post | CommentsBIOAndy Stern, 04.25.2008We are at a moment of enormous opportunity for working people. Americans have broad recognition of economic injustice, and we in SEIU have the hope of Barack Obama.Read Post | Comments (44)BIODan Abrams, 04.21.2008It is more than fair to ask -- in fact I would say its my journalistic duty to ask -- whether Karl Rove had any role in instigating the prosecution of a prominent Alabama Democrat.Read Post | Comments (120)BIOMia Farrow, 04.24.2008Many companies -- Coke, General Electric, Panasonic -- have simply remained silent.

They are genetically incapable of shame.Read Post | CommentsBIOPaul Hipp, 04.22.2008As my home state of Pennsylvania heads to the polls I thought I would post this song.
