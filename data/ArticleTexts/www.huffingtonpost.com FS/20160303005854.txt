{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor, historian, authorLike a professional magician who turns on his fellows and gives away the tricks of his craft, Donald Trump has exposed the folly of what used to pass as modern conservatism. Trump\u0027s choice after his victories on \"Super Tuesday\" to stage, not a bombastic victory speech, but a news conference (with New Jersey Governor Chris Christie by his side) was a media coup. Once again the Trump campaign displays its show-business chops and political shrewdness. With their precious careers at stake and Trump looking more and more like the Republican nominee, prominent right-wing intellectuals must either fall in line behind Trump like they did for Sarah Palin in 2008, or start a mass exodus toward the Democrats this November.Could Donald Trump have been stopped by the insiders and GOP establishment who today are wringing their hands and are in full on war to try and take him out? In looking back, I note five missed windows of opportunity.Political strategistThe death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has coincided with a schedule of arguments before the Supreme Court that will have an enduring impact on women\u0027s access to reproductive health care.

Hellerstedt, is being argued today.President, National Organization for WomenOver the last 12 months, there have been two issues that I\u0027ve felt personally drawn to, that I want to use my platform to say something about.

Let\u0027s chat, tweet me.Instead of spending some $4 billion on its weapons programs, Pyongyang could have provided 40 years of humanitarian assistance to its impoverished citizens, South Korea\u0027s Ambassador Oh Joon told reporters.Veteran journalist reporting from the United NationsGoing into tonight it was unclear what was going to happen because the polling was so shoddy in some states, especially Colorado and Minnesota. Those two states are so important because of what they mean for the future.Host, \u0027The Young Turks\u0027The lack of access to asylum and other protections is leaving thousands of children in highly vulnerable situations. This is not just a humanitarian crisis. We are witnessing a series of gross human rights violations. Lets call things by their real name.President and CEO Women’s Link WorldwideIt\u0027s impossible to diagnose \"where exactly so much has gone so wrong,\" but it\u0027s beyond certain that we\u0027ve hit a point past which Muslim simply cannot endure so much Islamophobia alone.Student at Columbia UniversityScapegoating member states situated at the external borders of the E.U is easy, but deeply unfair and deplorably narrow-sighted. In fact, this approach amounts to nothing more than choosing to ignore the magnitude and the complexity of the refugee and migrant crisis itself and the realities on the ground.Ambassador of Greece to the U.S.A.In short, a strong case can be made that Donald Trump\u0027s embrace of white supremacy goes beyond mere pandering, because racism has been the very foundation of the Trump empire.Writes on religion and politicsThe new sanctions against North Korea, just adopted by United Nations Security Council, are a critical part of efforts to contain that nation\u0027s nuclear weapons program. But they are not enough.President, Ploughshares Fund; Author, \u0027Nuclear Nightmares: Securing the World Before It Is Too Late\u0027It is entirely understandable that electing a first woman president would be seen as a progressive event in American history. And we do need more women in elected office generally. But which women?Seattle City Council Woman and member of Socialist AlternativeEven as I see the racist and Islamophobic practices of Trump\u0027s supporters day in and day out, as a brown, immigrant, Muslim woman, I refuse to believe that such behavior is inherent.Research Fellow, Teachers College, Columbia University; Education Affiliate, Religious Literacy Project, Harvard UniversityIf history tells us anything, it\u0027s that a) we\u0027ve seen this act before, b) that law enforcement will by hook or crook, get the capabilities it needs and c) it will come running to Congress for relief the next time a new technology crops up.Communications consultantShin Lim\u0027s journey to the top of the magic world is one that would not have been possible in the days of David Copperfield. Lim is nearly completely self-taught, which is pretty rare in the magic community, because his family did not have the means to support his passion for magic.Empowering a new generation of digital voicesTo those who say there is no political revolution, I say that if it\u0027s true then that\u0027s very sad -- because there should be. What\u0027s happening in the United States today is a corporate coup of the U.S. government, and anyone who isn\u0027t grieving that must not be looking.AuthorFolks who lived on the wrong side of the white, male Protestant divide for so many years aren\u0027t nearly as wistful about making \"America great again,\" because such a call to nostalgia feels like a sentimentality they can ill afford to entertain.Author; Editor; Speaker; ActivistContinued business-as-usual fossil fuel emissions will begin to make low latitudes inhospitable. If accompanied by multi-meter sea level rise, resulting forced migration and economic disruption could be devastating. Even global warming as small as 2°C, sometimes called a safe guardrail, may have large effects.Climatologist and Adjunct Professor, Columbia University Earth InstituteIf austerity is not rewarded electorally, even when it is \"successful,\" it makes sense for it to be disparaged more violently when it is not successful-- such as in the case of Greece.Editor-At-Large, HuffPost GreeceToday, the nation\u0027s highest court will hear Whole Woman\u0027s Health v. Hellerstedt, a case that will determine whether the state of Texas can shut down nearly all abortion care providers in the state, placing countless women at risk of serious harm and forcing health professionals to provide substandard care.nurse researcherWe need leaders who care about all communities, that have credible plans for progress, and who have experience fighting hard battles.Dean of the US House of Representatives | Ranking Member, House Judiciary CommitteeIn the current Polish culture war the “worst sort” of Poles are fighting back. Demonstrations have again become commonplace in Warsaw, and the liberal left is banding together in the face of the new threat.Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogThis whiskey is smooth and pleasant, without a hint of aftertaste. You will taste neither corn nor rye. Neither barley nor wheat. Because it’s not there. None of it.Father of twins, journalist, writer, lover of bourbon, wine and great beerWith each passing day, Republicans continue to talk about their plans to deport millions of hardworking immigrants families. It is this type of anti-immigrant rhetoric that continues to divide our communities. The stakes could not be higher for the immigrant community.Undocumented Immigrant, Online Activist \u0026 BloggerYou see, Daddy and I believe in love and that each of us deserves to have an over the moon in-love experience, and sadly, that\u0027s not what we have.
