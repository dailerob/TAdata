{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Director, Foreign Policy In FocusPresident Obama is no less committed to military action than any of his predecessors. He might personally have a less gung-ho disposition than, say, George W. Bush. But Obama\u0027s personality is only a small part of the equation. Despite the putative end of the Cold War, the United States has remained on a war footing. The national security apparatus is programed for intervention. What we see now taking place in the skies above Syria and Iraq is not an exception to the Obama-as-pacifist rule. It is a summation of a particular evolution in U.S. militarism toward the asymmetrical warfare of dispensing death at a distance.How would you like to help give away $100,000? It\u0027s not often that an opportunity like this comes your way. But thanks to the extraordinary generosity of the Learning By Giving Foundation, we have one.Founder of Stanford Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society; Founder of Silicon Valley Social Venture Fund (SV2); Author, \u0027Giving 2.0: Transform Your Giving and Our World\u0027While no one would wish for it to be vaulted to the forefront of daily conversation in the way it was, we, nonetheless, have an unprecedented opportunity to educate men and women, young and old, about boundaries and alternatives to violence.Philanthropist, Author, EntrepreneurMisplaced diagnostic exuberance has turned age-appropriate immaturity into a psychiatric disease and treats it with a pill, rather than just letting the kid grow up.Professor Emeritus, Duke UniversityTheirs not only is the marriage of two exceedingly interesting and talented individuals. It is also the marriage of impeccable glamor and compatible political ambition. And both marriages will be fascinating to watch!Family therapist and educatorWe should be demanding the reform for which those in Hong Kong are now fighting: an unbiased election, at every important stage.Author, \u0027Republic, Lost\u0027; Founder, RootstrikersBecause many whites feel that US society is now \"post racial,\" enabling them to \"get their black on\" without a physical presence in the black community, white label executives package black culture and style through white artists without the burdens of racial disadvantage.ProfessorIf immigration hawks in the House GOP are permitted to take our broken immigration system hostage through sheer intransigence, it is American people, American businesses, American workers, and American families that will suffer.Dean, Congressional Black Caucus | Ranking Member, House Judiciary CommitteeWe\u0027ve missed an opportunity for a discussion on the broader issue -- violence against college women, part of an age group which is the most vulnerable.President, The New AgendaMy idea of a good workout is a nice long walk, and my dog thinks that is even a bit too strenuous.Animal Welfare Editor, The Huffington PostA few weeks ago, as Ebola slipped down the world\u0027s list of priorities, I woke up in the middle of the night knowing I had to do something, in whatever way I could, to help fight the spread of this virus.Actor, musician and producerThe American public should be rightfully fearful of any policy maker who claims the gift of prophesy with regards to Mesopotamia, for in the words of Paul in his letter to the Corinthians, today we may speak as children, but soon we must put away our childish things, and view the past through a glass, darkly.Author, \u0027Dangerous Ground\u0027Sexism, gender-based double standards, and male entitlement are so normalized that girls think sexual assault and violence just \"part of life\" that they have to live with. Not to put too fine a point on it, but this is seriously f***ed up.Feminist, writer, and satirist (not always in that order)People with mental illness are some of the most marginalized and stigmatized people in our society. And as a result, many people are forced into silence about their illness. Many don\u0027t seek out help even though they are suffering, sometimes with dire consequences.Peer Life Coach, Trainer of Mental Health Professionals, Mental Health Advocate, Person In RecoveryInspired by the Brits, I decided to attempt my own historical objects list about New York, first as an article for The Times and now as a book. Its conceit: 100 might suffice for the world; New York needed 101.Urban affairs correspondent for The New York Times; Author of \u0027A History of New York in 101 Objects\u0027The views of conservative Republicans with civil liberty concerns and traditional Democratic liberals are much closer than to others in their own alleged groupings. Ralph Nader has just released a book looking at these underlying commonalities. And then he adds something else.Stanford and Harvard Law, 9 years WCC prosecutor; Prof. of Public Interest Law, founder of Children\u0027s Advocacy Institute at USD Law.Geno Smith got his shot and he missed. Actually, let me correct myself: Geno Smith got his shot and he missed wildly.The Huffington Post\u0027s sports columnist, The Schultz ReportThe Good Lie is the story of some of the \"Lost Boys\" of Sudan. It stars Reese Witherspoon. She helps the Lost Boys, but as is so often the case when we respond to God\u0027s call to care for our neighbor, they probably help her more. No one saves the day in this movie, but they all help save each other.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersIt\u0027s hard to own up to this stuff, but I want to make the point that having an eating disorder isn\u0027t some sort of win. It\u0027s isolating, exhausting -- they screw you physically and emotionally, and they siphon the joy out of life. And the joy out of the people closest to you. They suck.Currently doing an MSc in Poverty \u0026 Development at the University of Manchester. She edits Impolitikal.com.The Koch agenda, which is now on tape and in transcript form for anyone who wants to look, is devastating to Republicans if Democrats make it an issue. Democrats just have keep asking the question Republicans refuse to answer, about whether they would repudiate the agenda laid out at the Kochs\u0027 secret conference.Co-Founder, Democracy PartnersIt is sad and wrong that in response to evidence that Lockett\u0027s lethal injection was cruel and unusual, Oklahoma literally cloaked its execution process in secrecy.Staff Attorney, ACLU\u0027s Speech, Privacy, and Technology ProjectWhat is the end goal? Total occupation of Ukraine is doubtful as it would result in a civil war and an economic collapse, which is already underway with oligarchs still functioning despite the ouster of the corrupt president, Viktor Yanukovich. Or is a land link to Crimea the objective?Veteran journalist reporting from the United NationsThe goal of business in aggressively promoting CCSS while bashing the teaching profession into false, test-score-riddled \"accountability\" is to reshape the purpose of education into streamlined, assemly-line-to-market service.Public school teacher, education activist, PhDOf course the way we perceive, understand, interpret, and memorialize the Holocaust will inevitably change as the event recedes into history.

I\u0027ve grown kale plants on a roof deck in Greenwich Village and harvested it for salads in January.Psychiatrist, Author, Farmer Assistant Clinical Professor of Psychiatry, Columbia UniversityThe most recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan offer an ominous example about what can happen when the rush to war is met with sharp spending increases coupled with little to no oversight or fiscal restraint.Director, Arms and Security Project, Center for International PolicyAdvocacy Director, Win Without WarHis failure to strike a balance between his justifiable resistance to the occupation and the need to rally the support of the Israeli public was a major blunder, deeply injurious to the Palestinian cause.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUFinancial cases can seem complicated, especially in situations when there are multiple parties involved.

You do not have to change into your gym clothes and sweat it out. You don\u0027t even have to lay on a mat.Fitness Contributing Editor for Shape Magazine, Corporate Wellness Director and Fitness Nutrition SpecialistI grew up, fell in and out of love more times than my mother appreciated, and learned that the kind of passion Barry rhapsodized about wasn\u0027t easily found.
