{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"CTO @ The Huffington Post, Mgt HckrHumans are really bad at predicting the near future. Our minds have evolved to handle the immediate situation (fight or flight) as well as the long-term trends (winter is coming). Predicting how events will turn out in only a few months can leave us shell-shocked. But I\u0027m going to take a big risk here and make a near term prediction: The mobilization of live streaming media is going to hit in the next six to 12 months, and hit big. By this I mean that consumers who are currently streaming recorded news and entertainment on their TVs and laptops are going to phase-shift to interactive streaming live news and entertainment on their phones and pads. The big live events of 2012 showed that interactive streaming -- sharing up as well as streaming down -- is about to become part of our national consciousness.Read Post | CommentsDonna Brazile and Will Crossley, 11/13/12For more than two years Republicans have campaigned and legislated against the right of certain groups of people to vote. The Republicans\u0027 strategy failed because it awakened the most powerful force in a democracy: the determination of the voters themselves.Read Post | Comments (30)Christine Pelosi, 11/13/12Author, Campaign Boot Camp 2.0There they go again -- powerful men having illicit affairs while their apologists blame the women. Didn\u0027t we just vote to reject these Mad Men mores in last week\u0027s election? Apparently not everyone got the message.Read Post | Comments (223)Marlo Thomas, 11/13/12Award-winning actress, author and activistDid you know that insomnia affects women nearly twice as much as men? But women are more likely than men to report their insomnia to their doctor. Were you aware that the optimal temperature for deep sleep is around 68 degrees? That\u0027s why we toss and turn at night when it\u0027s too warm.Read Post | Comments (72)Jon Kamen and John Maeda, 11/13/12As we all know, STEM education is so important -- but on its own, sadly it\u0027s not working. Despite all of the resources being invested in it, the word is exactly what\u0027s wrong with the concept. It doesn\u0027t inspire, energize or engage the youth whom it is ultimately intended to benefit. It\u0027s why we need STEAM.Read Post | Comments (21)David Katz, M.D., 11/13/12Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterThe predominant efforts of health promotion might reasonably be catalogued in terms of carrots, sticks, and leading people to water -- whether or not we can make them drink it. Which leads, naturally, to horses.Read Post | Comments (30)Lisa Belkin, 11/13/12Senior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, The Huffington PostColloquial English language has no word for that -- no label we use to describe the man with whom a married woman cheats. Gigolo doesn\u0027t really cover it. Lover, perhaps, but no newspaper account would use it in a situation like this because their goal is to talk about sex without directly mentioning it. Paramour? That just sounds ridiculous.Read Post | Comments (30)William K. Black, 11/13/12Assoc. Professor, Univ. of Missouri, Kansas City; Sr. regulator during S\u0026L debacleThe \"left\" is not divided on the need to oppose austerity and the Great Betrayal. Third Way is not left or center or even right. It is Wall Street on the Potomac.Read Post | Comments (216)Alyona Minkovski, 11/13/12Host/Producer, HuffPost LiveLaws to safeguard our privacy and warrant requirements for online communications are muddled and outdated. The FBI’s actions here highlight the need for debate.Read Post | Comments (112)Bill Lucey, 11/13/12Writer on politics and historyWhat are compelling biographies which attempt to peel away the saintly image and iconography surrounding Mr. Lincoln? To help us with such a tall order, I reached out to some scholars and historians, who in addition to offering book recommendations, shared their favorite Abraham Lincoln anecdotes.Read Post | Comments (26)Dennis McFadden, 11/09/12Ashbel Smith Professor Emeritus in Experimental Psychology, University of Texas at Austin (Ret.)Many would argue that discrimination against left-handers or homosexuals is indefensible regardless of the origins of those attributes, but human prejudices are complex, and the simple reality is that many people find it easier to accept a difference that is believed to be innate.Read Post | Comments (529)Dena Takruri, 11/13/12HuffPost Live ProducerAs Muslim-Americans continue to navigate an often-hostile political terrain in the United States, a few recent victories have given cause for optimism.Read Post | Comments (18)Michael Hogan and Christopher Rosen, 11/13/12Well, it\u0027s official: We\u0027re now less than two months away from the 85th annual Oscar nominations. Are we having fun yet? (\"Party Down\" references never die.)Read Post | Comments (28)Tom Engelhardt, 11/13/12Editor, TomDispatch.comThis country is stuck in a hell of its own making that passes for everyday life at a moment when the world, for better and/or worse, is coming unstuck in all sorts of ways.Read Post | Comments (90)Martha Burk, 11/13/12Money Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsAt 16 percent of the electorate, Hispanics are nation\u0027s largest minority group, and you can bet they will be looking for a new direction from the president.Read Post | Comments (25)Marge Baker, 11/13/12Executive Vice President for Policy and Program, People For the American WayThe \"one-term president\" strategy created plenty of gridlock, set back the country\u0027s economic recovery and resulted in a historic vacancy crisis in the federal courts. The one thing it did not achieve was a one-term presidency.Read Post | Comments (107)Tamika Catchings, 11/13/12President of the WNBA Players AssociationAt some point in elementary school, I realized something. My peers could say whatever they wanted to about my disability, but if I worked hard enough, I could be better than them at something -- maybe I had an advantage after all.Read Post | CommentsMichael Winship, 11/13/12Senior writer, Moyers \u0026 Company; Senior writing fellow, Demos; President, Writers Guild, EastResistance is futile, as they say in those science fiction movies, but as long as the conservative right live in a media cocoon and act like sightless bats, trying to find their way with high frequency shrieking that bounces off the walls and only they can hear, you\u0027ve got trouble, my friends.Read Post | CommentsKevin Dutton, 11/12/12Psychology Professor, AuthorPsychopaths are everywhere. You might even be reading the words of one right now! But how can you tell?Read Post | Comments (552)Howard Fineman, 11/12/12Editorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupThe story teaches an old lesson: It\u0027s virtually impossible to overstate the comical hypocrisy of our leaders, especially those lionized to the point of canonization by a credulous media in search of uplift.Read Post | Comments (408)Robert Reich, 11/12/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Assuming the goal in the Grand Bargain is $4 trillion of deficit reduction over the next decade (that\u0027s the consensus of the Simpson-Bowles commission, the Congressional Budget Office, and most independent analysts), here\u0027s what the President should propose.Read Post | Comments (618)Amy Ephron, 11/12/12AuthorAs I watched as Petraeus tendered his resignation to the military and tepidly thanked his wife \"Hol,\" I was horrified and saddened. This is their personal tragedy and I\u0027m curious to see what decision she makes -- but another question lingers, perhaps a more interesting ethical question.Read Post | Comments (90)Pedro Almodóvar, 11/13/12Film director and producerEvictions are a real disaster that like tornadoes, hurricanes, and earthquakes, require governments to take immediate and effective action to help solve the desperation and absolute helplessness of their victims.Read Post | Comments (27)John W. Whitehead, 11/13/12Attorney and AuthorSo what does the future hold? Unless President Obama changes course -- and drastically so -- freedom as we have known it will become extinct.Read Post | Comments (45)D.L. Hughley, 11/12/12Actor and stand-up comedianRepublicans are having a hard time believing that Barack Obama was elected by \"the people,\" and the problem they are having is that \"the people\" is no longer a phrase synonymous with white America.Read Post | Comments (699)Tracy Schorn, 11/12/12Blogger at Chump Lady, Journalist, CartoonistOne of the worst things about being cheated on is others\u0027 wrongheaded notion that somehow you were in on the deal.
