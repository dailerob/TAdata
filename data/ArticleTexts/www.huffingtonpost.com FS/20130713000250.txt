{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Robert L. BorosagePresident, Institute for America\u0027s FutureConservative Republicans have turned the farm bill -- normally a bipartisan grotesquerie of agribusiness subsidies and excess -- from legislation to identity politics. They wanted to make a statement, even though they knew it couldn\u0027t survive the Senate or the White House veto. They passed it anyway -- without one Democratic vote -- to proclaim this is who we are. Who are they? They just passed a farm bill that included about $195 billion in subsidies to \"farmers\" (read: agribusiness) over 10 years, while eliminating food stamps and nutrition programs from the bill as \"extraneous.\"Comments (2,126)BLACKYo-yo performance artistI had reached the highest title in the yo-yo world -- but yo-yo is not in the Olympics, and it is not a major sport. Even the title of world champion had no value in society. I was crushed. I lived many spiritless days for many years.Comments (62)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Suppose a small group of extremely wealthy people sought to systematically destroy the U.S. government. Would you call this treason? If not, what would you call it? And what would you do about it?Comments (1,666)Patricia SundFlight attendant and freelance writerThere\u0027s a lot more to being a flight attendant than slinging orange juice. You just don\u0027t see it. If you saw what was covered in my manual, you\u0027d freak. And there\u0027s only so much training you can get before you run into something that has never happened before.Comments (119)Larry StraussVeteran high school teacher and coach, writerWhatever the verdict and however any of us feel about it, this incident is a symptom of a sickness of which we are all a part.Comments (366)Brian Levin, J.D.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityThe George Zimmerman murder trial is among the most closely watched criminal trials in recent memory. However, a crucial aspect of the trial, the jury instructions, hide in plain sight despite the wall-to-wall television coverage.CommentsJim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027God is far bigger than a single political party. What we cannot accept, nor allow, is for our own leaders to willfully exacerbate our problems and directly harm people who are already suffering -- to sacrifice the common good to their own ideological agendas.Comments (61)Mark Hyman, MDPracticing physicianThere is absolutely no biological requirement for milk, and the evidence for low-fat milk is lacking, along with the bone benefits. The dairy lobby has its tentacles deep in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.Comments (375)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorI sent D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray five questions to consider in deciding whether he would support or veto the living wage bill passed by the city council. These questions should be answered by any community considering the value of a Walmart store.Comments (52)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundWe know how to make a positive difference in the lives of so many poor Black males. But we have to close the gap between what we know and what we do. We don\u0027t have to keep doing the things we\u0027re getting wrong.CommentsSuzanne LeighHealth Reporter, Essayist, BloggerAt a retreat for parents of children with brain tumor and neuroblastoma, a group of us discuss alternative treatments. One parent mentions vitamins, another brings up curcumin. I mention our foray into the pot club.Comments (206)Josh SugarmannExecutive director, Violence Policy CenterWhy is it that National Rifle Association board member Ted Nugent gets away with joking about machine-gunning South Central Los Angeles residents from a helicopter, equating them with the feral hogs he likes to hunt in the same manner?Comments (850)Ahmed ZewailNobel laureate for Chemistry; Special Presidential Envoy for Science to the Middle EastReducing Egypt\u0027s predicament only to the issue of a coup without realizing the central issues of division and violence in today\u0027s Egypt is too simplistic and dangerous.CommentsMike RyanSenior Entertainment Writer, The Huffington PostI suspect that deep down we all like Adam Sandler, which is why we also kind of hate him. We certainly don\u0027t like all of his movies -- especially his recent ones -- but he seems like a nice enough guy. He\u0027s pleasant company on the talk show circuit and, by all accounts, is a good husband and father. Yet a lot of people will express honest-to-goodness vitriol toward Adam Sandler.Comments (209)Amy FloryWriterI used to do things. Now I do other things. But every now and again I get the chance to do one of the old things, and then I feel new again.Comments (70)Jon NegroniPublic relations writer and professional bloggerEvery Pixar movie is connected. I can explain how, and possibly why. It\u0027s a working narrative that ties together all of the Pixar movies into one, cohesive timeline with a main theme.CommentsDan RockwellDo you always have the last word? Do you think you know more than everybody? Is it always somebody\u0027s else\u0027s fault? Do you interrupt others? If you do, and if you don\u0027t want to be a total jackass, read on.CommentsMike LuxCo-Founder, Democracy PartnersThe House Republicans aren\u0027t just betraying their alleged savior by making people go hungry. They are betraying the values this country has lived by for a very long time.CommentsDr. Gail GrossFamily \u0026 Child Expert, Educator, Author. Ph.D. Ed.D.Fear of failure or already low self-esteem may further work to push those passions down to a forgotten place, where we try to tell ourselves they belong. The problem is that by attempting to silence our inner voice, we limit our true potential and our ability to lead full, happy lives.CommentsSanjay SanghoeeBanker, political and business commentator; author of \u0027Killing Wall Street\u0027 (www.killingwallstreet.com)How on earth do you stand up for agriculture while simultaneously denying the neediest people the means to obtain the fruits of that agriculture?Comments (46)Robert BrusteinPlaywright, director, actor, educator, theater founderThe chaos we are witnessing these days in the Middle East reflects not only a failure of American policy but also a pitiful lack of American self-knowledge.Comments (12)Siddharth ChatterjeeChief Diplomat and Head of Strategic Partnerships at the IFRC HQThe damages of war go far beyond what we once believed; society has now reached an understanding about the kind of moral, communal and psychological toll war can have on the soldiers, their family, community and even country.CommentsJohn DickCivicScience, Inc.Are the active tweeters and status updaters living a more enriched life or a more stressful one? We dug into our piles of data to shed some light on these questions.CommentsSang KimRestaurateur, WriterAfter receiving word that our daughter\u0027s sobo (grandmother) had passed away in Japan, her mother and I discussed whether we should engage our daughter in the potentially traumatic Buddhist rituals around her sobo\u0027s cremated body? We were mindful of the gravity of the experience and knew that it would be a watershed moment in our daughter\u0027s life. In the end, we thought she was ready.CommentsTamsin SmithPresident, SlipStreamStrategyIt\u0027s one thing to master oneself by overcoming fear, doubt, and insecurity. All mythical heroes must pass this threshold test. But BLACK takes it to the next level.CommentsMaureen RyanTV critic, The Huffington PostThe entertaining prison drama \"Orange Is the New Black\" manages to be both subversive and serious, both sweet and viciously barbed.CommentsLes LeopoldAuthor, \"How to Make a Million Dollars an Hour\" (Wiley 2013)Well, maybe it\u0027s time for Wall Street to contribute, rather than siphoning off our wealth. How about a sales tax on all transfers of stocks, bonds, and derivatives in order to fund tuition-free higher education at public institutions?Comments (143)Bizzy Emerson17-year-old student from ChicagoWhy have I always been so defensive over the Biebs? Well, aside from his beautiful face and surprisingly toned abs, I\u0027ve always felt that there is more than meets the eye with Justin.Comments (41)Eric BoehlertSenior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaThe trial, and the irresponsible right-wing commentary surrounding it, represents the latest example of how the conservative press remains incapable of dealing honestly with issues that the nation grapples with when an African-American (Democrat) sits in the White House.Comments (103)Gordon BrownFormer Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationMalala Yousafzai, the girl the Taliban shot for going to school and who has become the world\u0027s symbol for the right of every girl to have an education, will speak at the United Nations on her sixteenth birthday today.Comments (18)Candace WalshAuthor, \u0027Licking the Spoon: A Memoir of Food, Family, and Identity\u0027I never learned a single trick. I didn\u0027t gain friends by teaching others how to yo-yo. Instead, I forged tenuous, make-do friendships with other oddballs who still believed in the Easter Bunny, or punched my shoulder when we didn\u0027t agree -- who didn\u0027t feed my soul.CommentsChris Weigant, 2013.12.07Hector Villagra, 2013.12.07Barry Lando, 2013.12.07Gregory C.
