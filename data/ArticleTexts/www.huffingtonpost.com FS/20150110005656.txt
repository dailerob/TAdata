{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor of law and political science, Yale; Author \u0027The Decline and Fall of the American Republic\u0027The French are right to insist that there is a \"third way\" between an endless war on terrorists and a rigid adherence to normal legal standards when confronting a wave of terrorist attacks. Congress should pass a statute under which it, not the Court, decides whether conditions remain sufficiently grave to justify the continuation of extraordinary measures. Congress is up to the task. The standard partisan divisions need not prevent the construction of a solid system of checks-and-balances for future emergencies. There are strong civil libertarians and national security advocates in both parties. The challenge is to reach common ground. Many other countries have, like the French, enacted new emergency regimes in the expectation that terrorism will generate grave, but intermittent, crises throughout the twenty-first century. It is past time for us to do the same.This isn\u0027t just a battle over industry influence. This is a choice about the kind of nation we want to live in. Do we want to live in a country where expert reviews don\u0027t matter and industry profits trump our families\u0027 health? Or do we want something better?Actor, director and environmental activistThere\u0027s more happening here, and it comes down to the fact that Paltrow\u0027s a woman. How often do we see male celebrities, or men in general, tasked for the stuff-- whether vain or frivolous or \"too indulgent\"-- they spend their money on?Author, research psychologist and gender scholarHere is the awful math of New Year\u0027s resolutions. By the time you read this, there is a roughly 25 percent chance that you have given up. Already. After nine days.Senior Financial Writer, The Huffington PostCartoonist and bloggerAs a nation it\u0027s time to close our hypocrisy gap in the treatment of our children and value and protect our children -- all of them. We need to examine with urgency how we treat our children and the gap between what we say and what we do.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundWhile we\u0027ve heard pro-fracking propaganda before from the Obama administration, many Americans have had enough of it and I\u0027m one of them. In 2008, I voted for \u0027Hope and Change,\u0027 but we are not getting the change we hoped for.Oscar-nominated actor, climate change activistThis isn\u0027t a story about regret or failure. I raise my voice because I do a lot as a parent, because there\u0027s a lot going on. We all have a lot going on. And kids don\u0027t listen all the time, nor should they be expected to.Father of two and blogger at PuzzlingPosts.comLittle brothers aren\u0027t supposed to die. This is something you know as a child without someone telling you. Little brothers, the ones who are a foot taller than you and who smile with their eyes, do not die at age 30. But heroin addicts do.Mother, Writer, Student. Sometimes funny fat girl at parties.So there you have it. If you like bone broth, sip bone broth -- although I do think you are obliged to consider the lives, and deaths, that spawned those bones. Cruelty has no place on the menu of decent people, whatever our gustatory inclinations.Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterWhat would truly be a disaster now would be for France (and Europe) to react to the Charlie Hebdo attack in the same blind, mindless fashion that America\u0027s leaders reacted to 9/11. Nothing would more benefit al-Qaeda and its modern spin-offs.Author, \"The Watchman\u0027s File\"For decades, Americans have been trapped in the boom-bust cycle of resource extraction. Approving Keystone XL will further bind America to an industry that is rapidly losing ground to more sensible and sustainable energy solutions.Dean of the US House of Representatives | Ranking Member, House Judiciary CommitteeNaysayers will claim there is no money on the federal or state level to support the president\u0027s plan. But we must go beyond viewing free community college as a handout and rather see it as an investment in our country\u0027s future.President of Ivy Tech Community CollegeThere\u0027s plenty of real estate for extraterrestrial life, right? Well, maybe not.Senior Astronomer, SETI InstituteUp until last year, insurance companies could -- and often did -- charge women different premiums than men for the same coverage. As of January 1, 2014, the ACA prohibits this gender discrimination.Senior Advisor to the President and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsGiven the dramatically changing political dynamic between them in recent days, the Israelis and Palestinians have now, as in the past, only one choice to make -- they must coexist.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUThough this attack happened in France, there are few things considered to be more American than our right to our freedom of speech. By contrast there should be few things less patriotic than skulking away with our tail between our legs when someone threatens that freedom.Author of \"A Fearless Voice\", Media Strategist and Political CorrespondentHeritage\u0027s defense of the House is a good example of the right\u0027s timeworn strategies for concealing -- perhaps, at times, even from itself -- the moral and human implications of its actions.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourYou want to fulfill my fantasies, right? Satisfy my deepest desires? I thought so. That\u0027s why I\u0027m going to cut right to the chase and let you know exactly what I want between the sheets: no guessing games, no playing coy, just straight to the stuff that will make me melt.Writer, wife, and mom to four energetic little boys. Lover of zombies, baking, and science. Blogger at FightingFrumpy.com.To believe that the attack in Paris was a tragedy singularly about a cartoon or as an event solely to be defined as an assault on freedom of expression, is to be daft and incongruent with the history and reality of American and Western policy in the Middle East.Senior Fellow, Center for International Policy; MatthewHoh.comIf one of your New Year\u0027s resolutions is to become a runner, here are some tips to help you set off on the right foot. There is a ton of information out there on how to do it the \"right way,\" and I\u0027d argue that you have to find the way that works best for you!Wife, Mother, Runner, Writer at MyFitFamilyNone of this is reason to stop mourning the horrific murders in Paris or to excuse it in any way. But it is reason to wonder why the media can never tell a more balanced story of what is happening our world.Editor, Tikkun MagazineThese legacies can take the form of significant self-renewing, nonprofit, civic institutions either at the national or regional level. No hidden agendas, no obscure profit motives, no self-aggrandizement; just extending the torch of wisdom, foresight, and imagining brighter futuresConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorThe latest Greek crisis, again threatening stability in Europe and beyond, is not principally financial. At any rate not yet. Instead, it stems from a serious anomaly that can be traced to the two consecutive referenda that summarily abolished the monarchy in Greece four decades ago.Emeritus Professor of Economics, University of AthensTo see the incredibly talented Quvenzhané singing \"Tomorrow\" in the trailer gives me hope. Maybe we\u0027ll see more starring roles for people of color in the future. Maybe a little girl will see the movie and see herself. Perhaps this will be the start of her career.Teen writer from New YorkReligion isn\u0027t a person. It is a set of ideas in a book. It doesn\u0027t have rights. It doesn\u0027t have emotions. It doesn\u0027t have a family or children. Those cartoonists were living, breathing human beings. They had rights, emotions, and families. Which of these deserves your respect?Pakistani-Canadian writer, physician and musicianWhen the GOP trumpets \"new jobs,\" it\u0027s typically a ploy to divert gullible Americans from the true Republican agenda: lining the pockets of the rich.Berkeley writer, retired Silicon Valley executiveOf course, it\u0027s troubling to think that police can start or stop writing a ticket, as if it\u0027s some sort of spigot, to express their rage. What other public servants have that sort of tool at their fingertips? But if the police are doing this, there are some benefits.HuffPost Crime and Weird News editorAs a bride, over the next 12-18 months you will be making so many decisions; fashion, food, decor, guests, drinks, it all has to be planned and all eyes are on you.
