{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUI completely disagree with the characterizations of the deal as entirely good or bad, and certainly it is not historic as of yet. How the deal will be implemented, whether or not Iran ultimately acquires nuclear weapons in five or 10 years, and how the U.S. in particular will act throughout the implementation process will determine if the deal is successful or not, and whether it passes the threshold of being \"historic.\" By employing this kind of rhetoric, the aim is obviously to suggest that Iran has turned the page, that there is no going back to the way things were, and that in fact a new day has dawned. But does this agreement constitute an event in the sense that it marks a radical turning point in the politics of Iran?Our only hope for genuine change is if poor, working class, middle class, black, Latino, and white come together in a powerful movement to take back our economy and democracy from the moneyed interests that now control both.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Is Trump\u0027s run really that surprising? It shouldn\u0027t be if you\u0027ve been paying attention to the radical, obstructionist turn both Republican politics and the right-wing media have taken over the last six-plus years. Yet during most of that span, the D.C. media stoically pretended the GOP hadn\u0027t taken an ugly, radical turn.Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaTake a look at this video, in which a white male New York City police lieutenant grabbed a 6th grade elementary school student of color -- big for her age but only 11 years old -- around the neck and threw her to the pavement on a Bronx street corner, six months after Eric Garner was wrestled down on a Staten Island pavement.Civil Rights Lawyer and contributing opinion writerNicki Minaj identified an industry preference for what is seen as attractive, acceptable and what should be rewarded. It shouldn\u0027t be surprising that black artists feel some type of way when their cultural influence is undeniable but remains unrecognized. It is, however, surprising that the industry that still makes money off the backs of black artists still doesn\u0027t take them seriously.Huffington Post Canada blog editorThis is a historic moment. It marks a huge shift in mainstream thinking about the economy. Workers have won a better life for themselves and their families. We\u0027ve beat back CEO-backed trickle-down economics. But we won\u0027t stop fighting until all workers win higher wages as the movement grows stronger.Executive Director, Citizen Action of New YorkWisconsinites became more and more aware we were dealing with an enemy of democracy. American voters would be wise to learn from our experience.Director, Family Values @ WorkSHARJAH, United Arab Emirates -- The Saudi curriculum is laced with references faulting any minority that doesn\u0027t follow Wahhabi teachings, referring to them as \"deviants\" and \"polytheists.\" And Iran\u0027s continuous support for its sectarian proxies has widened the Shia-Sunni divide and prompted Saudi Arabia to launch its current war against the Houthis. While both sides fuel the flames, ISIS is thriving in the fire.Director\u0027s Fellow, MIT Media Labs; UAE-based columnistI spoke with Till Roenneberg about the effects of \"social jet lag\" on our behavior and performance, the changes schools and companies can make to accommodate our biological needs, and the aggressive campaign required to take away the \"coolness\" of sleep deprivation.Associate Editor, The Huffington PostThe Export-Import Bank died when its charter expired at the end of June.

We are counting on the EPA to ensure that the coal industry\u0027s progress in cleaning up its noxious pollution isn\u0027t stalled any further.Director, Sierra Club\u0027s Beyond Coal CampaignYou talk about transitioning to clean energy sources, but tapping into Arctic oil reserves would open a spigot that would be politically difficult for you or future presidents to turn off.Oceans Director, Center for Biological DiversityBlack Lives Matter at Netroots Nation; We Recap Our Interview with InfoWars Conspiracy Theorist Dan Bidondi; Trump Attacks Lindsey Graham; and much more.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027Before my son\u0027s diagnosis, I saw strength as solid and stoic. Unbreakable and unmovable. It was the refusal to cry at funerals or sad movies. It was the brave face of people showing the world nothing could phase them. It was the ability to lock out all of the emotions that could hurt.Mother, Ultra runner, Writer, Seeker of adventure, Lover of all things chocolateOne year ago this week, an oil train passing through Seattle ran off the tracks underneath the Magnolia Bridge, derailing three of its 100 tank cars carrying Bakken crude oil from North Dakota.Seattle City CouncilmemberUnfortunately, the more interested I am in getting to know a particular person, the worse this will be. If I really want someone to like me, I\u0027m extra careful with what I say, which then ends up being little or nothing at all.Writer, freelance editor, and occasional ukulele rocker.One of the fundamental reasons why people are prejudiced against gay people is because they are uncomfortable with the idea of two people of the same sex having sex. Psychological studies have shown for decades that we as a society are deeply uncomfortable, and at times disgusted, by same-sex sexuality, and in particular gay male sexuality.GLAD Executive Director, LGBTQ rights lawyerWe all know that getting any legislation through Congress is really hard right now. But we also know that LGBT movements are stronger and better connected than ever. When the original Equality Act was first introduced more than four decades ago, its passage may have seemed like a pipe dream. Today, it is not.Founding Executive Director, National Center for Transgender EqualityThe dash-cam video of Ms. Bland\u0027s confrontation with a Texas State Trooper shows the demise of an American woman who posed absolutely no threat to anyone.Columnist and author published in The Hill, The Baltimore Sun, The Jerusalem Post, Salon, and other publicationsAs I write this, my children are asleep in their room, Loretta Lynn is on the stereo, and my wife is out on a date with a man named Paulo. It\u0027s her second date this week; her fourth this month so far.Combining the beauty of a high-end fashion magazine with the dynamic energy of the webIf Iran poses an \"existential\" threat to Israel and to the Arab-Sunnis, perhaps the time has come for them to reach a deal on the Palestinian issue? The Iran deal may be the first step in a process that would allow Middle Easterners to finally start writing their own histories instead of expecting Washington to.Senior Analyst, WikistratHaving a bad memory has a lot of advantages.

You Google like a ninja.Writer, comedian and creator of TheCooperReview.comSocial Security\u0027s benefits are modest and don\u0027t cover a number of eventualities, such as parental leave and sick days, which the Social Security programs of other countries cover.
