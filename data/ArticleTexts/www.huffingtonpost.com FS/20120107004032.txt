{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"I\u0027m delighted to announce the publication of HuffPost\u0027s fourth e-book, OCCUPY: Why It Started. Who\u0027s Behind It. What\u0027s Next. It\u0027s the result of three months of near obsessive reporting by our staff on the Occupy Wall Street movement. Occupy began quietly enough -- a few activists and a Twitter hashtag eventually led to a couple hundred people gathering in Zuccotti Park on September 17, 2011. And then the movement grew. It was a response to the growing feeling that the essential compact of the American Dream -- if you work hard and play by the rules, you\u0027ll be rewarded -- could no longer be trusted. And not only is our political system unable to repair it, our political institutions were complicit in the breakdown. This book is about the beginning. When future histories of Occupy are written, this will be just the first chapter.Read Post | Comments (928)Marlo Thomas, 1/6/12Award-winning actress; Author; ActivistToday my father, Danny Thomas, would have been 100-years-old.
