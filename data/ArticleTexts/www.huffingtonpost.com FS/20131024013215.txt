{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Dylan RatiganNew York Times Best-Selling author, entrepreneur and formerly the host of MSNBC\u0027s The Dylan Ratigan ShowThe value proposition I would like to put to all doctors, mine included, is as simple as it is impossible: Don\u0027t let me or anyone I know die. The result of this value proposition is a state-of the art traumatic and acute care system for which customers will pay any price. Because this system is shaped by the question, \"How much would you pay to not die?\" This is what we have, and it is impossible to sustain. As a result of our health care system based on the wrong value proposition, we have Democrats and Republicans pushing the country into an obviously insane shutdown over health care. To them, it is all a fantasy battle based on competing visions of \"Don\u0027t Let Anyone Die.\" So what if the value proposition was equally simple but absolutely possible: Help me, my family and friends live long and prosper.Comments (69)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Conservative Republicans have lost their fight over the shutdown and debt ceiling, and they probably won\u0027t get major spending cuts in upcoming negotiations over the budget.But they\u0027re winning the big one: How the nation understands our biggest domestic problem.Comments (951)Jill PuleriGlobal Industry Leader, Retail Global Services, IBMAs consumers, you\u0027ve been enjoying a lot of power lately. Thanks to digital tools and an abundance of information, you can generally ask for and receive much more individualized service from your favorite service provider -- whether it be an insurance company, car dealer, a retailer or a bank. But this may only be the beginning.CommentsClif DickensGraphic designerComments (94)Ellen StumboWriterMy mother and this relationship we had. So tested, yet so strong. More than anyone else, I cared about what she thought. Maybe because I knew I was so much like her. Maybe because if I saw strength in her, I knew I could be strong too.Comments (37)Gregory PatrickWriter and knitterI\u0027m sitting at Starbucks, which I rarely do. It\u0027s hard to knit there. I lot of people still find it weird for a man to be knitting in public. But, for us fellas that knit, it\u0027s nothing short of ordinary.Comments (208)Leisha Davison-YasolBlogger, cancerinmythirties.wordpress.comAre you kidding me? How on earth could a day where girls and women are encouraged to post and share photos of their braless breasts and to walk around with their nipples poking through their shirts be \"supportive\" for women who are living with or who have died from breast cancer?Comments (212)Literally, DarlingOnline magazine for twenty-something womenMaybe I am like a Sim character, and used up too many points in the ass department to have any left for the chest area when I was created. Who knows.Comments (374)Arianna HuffingtonAs part of our site-wide focus on well-being and sustainability, Food For Thought will be examining our attitudes toward food, asking where our food comes from and how it\u0027s produced, because there are plenty of forces and special interests at work that would rather you not ask too many questions -- at great cost to our environment, our health, and the planet.Comments (146)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarSocial media-induced angst is happening with increasing frequency. Just as businesses and brands use social media to interact with their target audience and monitor consumer interest, people are using social media to gauge how their friends and acquaintances feel about them.CommentsLisa BelkinSenior Columnist, The Huffington PostI have been very public about my disagreement with those who would have guns in homes with children, and even going so far as to call it lax parenting. But is it criminal? And is punishing parents when children do the wrong thing the way to keep other children from doing the same?Comments (21)Bonnie GleicherFounder and manager, thisiswhyiloveny.com\"This is my home,\" you think. \"I\u0027m actually here. How lucky am I.\" You start to feel really proud of all you\u0027ve accomplished to get to this point, and you feel really great, until you pay $10 for a beer and leave your phone in a cab.CommentsWill BunchAuthor, \u0027Tear Down This Myth\u0027The reality is that when it comes to the science of flying death robots, the United States is the world leader. Our drone systems may not be 100 percent perfect, but they rarely fail. When it comes to killing people remotely from the air, nobody does it better. Technologically, that is. Morally, it\u0027s a different story.Comments (132)Rep. Debbie Wasserman SchultzAuthor, \u0027For the Next Generation\u0027; Chair, Democratic National CommitteeRepublicans have held the DREAM Act back, claiming that its enactment would encourage immigration and that beneficiaries would take jobs that would have otherwise gone to American-born workers. These claims are pure paranoia, with no basis in fact.CommentsScott Barry Kaufman, Ph.D.Author, \u0027Ungifted: Intelligence Redefined\u0027; co-founder, The Creativity PostThe romantic notion that mental illness and creativity are linked is so prominent in the public consciousness that it is rarely challenged. So before I continue, let me nip this in the bud: Mental illness is neither necessary nor sufficient for creativity.Comments (18)Suzy StrutnerFellow, Huffington Post TravelVery few employers are interested in lending you three weeks to wander aimlessly, explore the greater universe, and \"find yourself.\" Do it now.CommentsMike LuxCo-Founder, Democracy PartnersThere is a lot of waste in government spending. It\u0027s just a fact we should deal honestly with. But here\u0027s where the conservatives get it all wrong: What is wasteful in government spending is when we directly subsidize huge corporate interests.CommentsDokhi FassihianInternational human rights expert.The international community has the responsibility to elevate the human rights portfolio on par with other issues, and to induce Iran\u0027s cooperation with the UN Human Rights Council and its appointed mandate holder.CommentsJason HughesOvernight Editor, HuffPost TVSomebody over at \"Marvel\u0027s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\" has been listening. This week, we got some much-needed character development as well as a more substantial tease about our larger menace -- they even got a name!Comments (17)Sandra Hawken DiazVP, Marketing and Communications, Canadian Women\u0027s FoundationLast week my 12-year-old son and his friends used a term I hadn\u0027t heard before: \"rape face.\" So we sat down to talk. He was emphatic that #rapeface wasn\u0027t actually about rape and rolled his eyes with a \"mom, what\u0027s the big deal?\" We need to be having these conversations with our kids.Comments (92)Alicia GaySenior Communications Strategist, ACLU Center for LibertyComments (14)Allison VesterfeltWriterYou might be wondering why on earth I\u0027m showing you a picture of my couch. Here\u0027s why: It\u0027s because this is what it looks like to give up everything.CommentsEight by EightThe magazine the beautiful game deservesBarcelona\u0027s breathtaking football made Guardiola the most coveted coach in European football, so why did he chose Bayern rather than a club in the English Premier League?CommentsJonathan KimGentleman farmer, film critic for ReThink Reviews and the Uprising ShowCarrie has been remade, prompting many to ask why anyone would bother remaking a film that\u0027s still referenced today and is widely considered to be a horror classic. But here\u0027s the thing -- I don\u0027t really care about that since I\u0027ve never seen the original Carrie.Comments (23)Isabel Foxen DukeCertified health coach and emotional eating expert.I hate the word \"curvy,\" because although I\u0027m a size 8-10, the word just doesn\u0027t describe me. I have a nice solid trunk, but no rolls unless I\u0027m sitting down, or having sex with my legs in the air.Comments (60)Sen. Barbara BoxerU.S. Senator from California; Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works CommitteeHow much more pain and uncertainty do Americans have to endure before Congress decides that it should pay the bills it has racked up? Businesses and families must always pay their bills and so must Congress.Comments (375)Conde Nast TravelerCondeNastTraveler.comThey haven\u0027t been traveling long, but it may be that Millennials, those precocious darlings of demographers born in the mid-\u002780s, are the world\u0027s most accomplished travelers. Whatever your age, the travel tricks of Millennials offer generally good guidance.CommentsRachel M. MartinWriter, Findingjoy.netMotherhood is a brave journey. It\u0027s always been this brave thing to raise another independent, pushing the limits, melt your heart at night, love them forever even when they drive you crazy, human. That\u0027s what you\u0027re doing. Even on those tired days.Comments (70)Adam RobertsWriter, The Amateur GourmetIt\u0027s the pact with readers that make bloggers such a powerful force. We may not be experts by your definition, but if an expert is someone that audiences trust to guide them in the right direction, we meet that criteria handily.CommentsJames EngellProfessor, Harvard UniversityThe fact of climate change caused by human beings is emphatically not political. It is rather an issue of science, humanity, and morality. The science is clear, just ask any reputable scientist, including many at Harvard. Our actions will supply the humanity and morality -- or lack of those qualities.CommentsMaria HinesChefChefs are in a unique position to play an important role in improving the food system because we have a lot of consumer trust. Our agenda is to feed people delicious food and make them happy. What\u0027s not to trust in that?CommentsAdam GrantWharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027To figure out whether economics education can shift people in the selfish direction, we need to track beliefs and behaviors over time -- or randomly assign them to economics exposure. Here\u0027s what the evidence shows.Comments (317)Richard (RJ) Eskow, 2013.23.10Findery, 2013.23.10Scott Mowbray, 2013.23.10Kathy Stevens, 2013.23.10Michael Calderone, 2013.23.10Richard Buery, 2013.23.10Lin Humphrey, 2013.23.10Diana Scholl, 2013.23.10Auren Kaplan, 2013.23.10Bonnie Gleicher, 2013.23.10Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"BofA BUSTED FOR FRAUD",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
