{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"With the nation mourning the victims of the Charleston church massacre and observing the 150th anniversary of Juneteenth, the June 16th commemoration of slave emancipation, there\u0027s no better time to confront the toxic influences of racism and easy access to guns that came together this week. \"We can\u0027t accept events like this as routine,\" said President Obama. Actually, that was what he said after Newtown, several mass shootings ago. This time the president was, rightfully, angrier and wearier. \"I\u0027ve had to make statements like this too many times,\" he said, noting that \"at some point, we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries.\" That reckoning should happen now -- right now -- even as the Confederate flag continues to shamefully fly at full mast above the South Carolina state house.People often ask me whether being President has made it more difficult to spend time with Michelle and our girls. But the surprising truth is that being in the White House has made our family life more \"normal\" than it\u0027s ever been.44th President of the United StatesWhat happened to our family is part of a larger attack on Black and Brown bodies. To impact change, we must recognize the connection between racism, hate crimes and racialized policing. While the focus for this specific attack was on African-Americans, we all have a responsibility to seek not only justice for the victims, but an end to racial injustice.Minister for Youth Advocacy and Leadership Formation, United Church of Christ; Cousin of Rev. Depayne MiddletonAs soon as I heard about the mass killing of nine worshipers at Charleston\u0027s Emanuel AME Church, my heart broke -- again. Yet another gunman, yet another place that should be safe from violence, even more families shattered. No more Charlestons. No more Newtowns, Auroras or Isla Vistas. Not one more.Founder, Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in AmericaThose who feel utter disgust and anger, as I do, at the killing of nine innocent people in Charleston, S.C., have no other choice but to channel our anger in love-based constructive response.Diversity Visiting Professor, University of San Francisco; and Scholar Writer in Residence, MLK, Jr. Institute, Stanford UniversityWhen real people plead guilty to felonies, they go to jail. But big banks aren\u0027t people despite what the five Republican appointees to the Supreme Court say.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The Global Moms Relay is one of my favorite HuffPost traditions, a collaborative effort to tap into our collective gratitude and love, not only for our own mothers, but for all mothers around the world. This year\u0027s theme is \"What kind of world do you want for your family in 2030?\" And we\u0027re using the HuffPost platform to bring more and more voices into this conversation and harness the power of social media for good.The Pope\u0027s future is different, but we want to move in the same direction out of this particular dark patch of time. And, although the disagreements concern \"philosophical\" questions, they will not have theoretical answers, only historical ones. Time will tell.Professor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027Positive and constructive approaches offer a way to strengthen journalism, at a time when more than ever, we need a way of looking at the world that sparks the potential in us all.Editor-in-chief of Positive News, co-founder of the Constructive Journalism ProjectNo matter how much their fathers may have disappointed or hurt them, all the women I met felt a measure of loyalty and gratitude to them. Fathers matter a great deal not only in childhood but well into adulthood -- and yet few women are truly aware of the ways in which their fathers impact them.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarYoga is helping to create a global shift to a culture of oneness that is dissolving boundaries and infusing us all with love.Author, CEO of The Shift NetworkIt\u0027s not breaking news that being black in America can be difficult and frightening, to say the least. Now, more than ever, we cannot ignore or mask the reality that we live in a country where one\u0027s complexion can be a direct threat to safety and livelihood.Black Voices Editor, The Huffington PostWhen states fail to pass laws that effectively restrict access to illegal guns, and instead enact laws to make it easier to buy and carry guns, they fail to sufficiently value Black lives and the lives of other Americans adversely affected by gun crime and violence.Professor of Law at The George Washington University Law School; Senior Fellow at DemosProgram Director, Joyce FoundationA victory by the masses, or \"everyday people,\" over big money and big media is always grounds for celebration. But it is important to remember the game is far from over. This is one of those bills, like the TARP, where we are playing by rich people\u0027s rules.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027To all of you who have lost a father whom you have loved dearly and who showed you that love right back, I hope you can embrace Father\u0027s Day with a spirit of gratitude and courage. In my father, God gave me the greatest gift ever: an angel to watch over me. And, this Sunday, I will celebrate him.Emmy Award-winning journalist, producer and TV hostFor more than a decade and at very considerable expense, the United States has been attempting to create an Iraqi government that governs and an Iraqi army that fights; the results of those efforts speak for themselves: they have failed abysmally.Author, \u0027The Limits of Power: The End of American Exceptionalism\u0027As U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan put it, \"I am increasingly worried that our teachers, our administrators don\u0027t reflect the great diversity of our nation\u0027s students, and that is a real problem.\"President, Children\u0027s Defense FundIn the wake of the horrendous racist terrorist attack on Charleston\u0027s historic Emanuel AME church that left nine innocent African-American churchgoers and leaders dead, many questions have arisen about hate crimes and extremism in the United States. Here are some answers.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityWhy are people willing to pay for the right to put their message on a license plate, rather than just put it on a bumper sticker? Justice Breyer suggests that it is because they want the state\u0027s endorsement of their message. The problem, though, is that this is about the state discriminating among private speakers based on whether it approves or disapproves of the message. This, the First Amendment does not permit.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoDad would be so proud to see how we\u0027ve come together, and grown, since his passing. I imagine him sitting back, with a big smile on his face, marveling at how we\u0027ve healed and how we\u0027ve taken his biggest dream -- prizing family above all else -- and made it a reality.Editorial Director, Lifestyle; The Huffington PostIn remembering John Carroll, what is less talked about are the journalistic characteristics and personal beliefs that formed the basis of his philosophy. Call them Carroll\u0027s rules of the road -- rules that are challenged mightily by an Internet-driven society that provides every voice, no matter how dissonant or anonymous, with a megaphone.Media consultant, former managing editor of the Los Angeles TimesFmr. Managing Editor of the Los Angeles Times and Fmr. Executive Features Editor of the Huffington PostIt\u0027s hard to believe that it\u0027s been 24 years since I picked out a Father\u0027s Day card. I always enjoyed that ritual of choosing just the right one--funny or loving--that I knew my dad would enjoy.Award-winning actress, author and activistIn the upcoming performance art piece called the GOP presidential debates the candidates will try to one-up each other showing their base who\u0027s best at crushing labor unions, disciplining the poor, and striking fear in the hearts of America\u0027s enemies.Professor, historian, authorIt\u0027s not enough to tell our daughters to stand up for themselves. Part of putting an end to harassment involves educating boys to be completely accepting of women, both at home and at work, so that harassment becomes a relic of the past.Journalist, wife, mama, author of Getting Real, and Fox News Host of The Real Story with Gretchen Carlson weekdays 2PM EST.The position of the majority Republicans is that you should always balance the budget for... I just sat with these folks for two long hours and I can\u0027t really finish that sentence.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorI once spent $5 on lottery tickets out of desperation, despite knowing as a math teacher that the probability of winning was essentially zero. But I teach, hoping that it will get better for me, for my students, and for my own kid who falls into that strange not-rich, not-poor-enough no man\u0027s land. There is no middle class that we fit into.Math teacherUnfortunately, for a speech that mostly is progressive, Clinton begins by bolstering austerity economics. Her first villains are Republicans, whom she blames for squandering \"surpluses that could have eventually paid off our national debt,\" noting that, \"Republicans twice cut taxes for the wealthiest, borrowed from other countries to pay for two wars and family incomes dropped.\" This is bad economics in a very confused narrative.Senior Fellow, Roosevelt Institute; author of \u0027Fighting for Our Health\u0027King Jeb only looks out for himself and people like him. He never has, and never will, fight for middle class families. And even though Americans already know what a Bush presidency will mean for them, Jeb Bush still plans to run for President in 2016.Author, \u0027For the Next Generation\u0027; Chair, Democratic National CommitteeIn a crime that has outraged locals, a sniper has reportedly shot down the beloved Confederate flag that traditionally graces the Statehouse in Columbia, South Carolina. \"This was clearly one very disturbed individual,\" said Council Chairman Harvey \"Harve\" Jeffcoat. \"And I can tell you with certainty that he does not represent our community.\"Novelist, Amnesia, Milrose Munce, GalunkerEvery kid growing up in a South Asian household knows there is a certain four-letter word you shan\u0027t utter. No, it\u0027s not the f-word, and no it doesn\u0027t rhyme with hit. It\u0027s the l-word: love.Associate Editor, Huff/Post 50Speaking out against the impending injustice against Haitians in the Dominican Republic is the first thing we can do to begin to reclaim our credibility and moral standing.
