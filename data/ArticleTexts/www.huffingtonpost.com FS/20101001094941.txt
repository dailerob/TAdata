{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"My book tour has officially been crowdsourced... and we have our winners! After nearly 400,000 votes were cast, you have decided that I\u0027ll be going deep into the heart of Texas, to Harlem, and to the campus of Stony Brook University on Long Island to talk about the issues contributing to our country\u0027s slow slide into Third World America. I also want to remind everyone about the webcast we\u0027ll be hosting next Wednesday, October 6, at 8:30 pm EST to talk about the problems facing America\u0027s beleaguered middle class -- and the steps we can all take to turn things around. Anyone with an Internet connection can join the event -- but we think the best way to be a part of it is to host or sign up for a HuffPost Meetup.
