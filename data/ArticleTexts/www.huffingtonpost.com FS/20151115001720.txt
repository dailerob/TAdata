{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editorial Director, Le Huffington PostWe ask ourselves questions on this form of terrorism that is yet again reaching new heights: no prophet to avenge, no police, journalists, military personnel, or Jews to kill, just blindly raining bullets on young people and not-so-young people who were merely seeking insouciance, music, happiness on a mild November night. So this is incomprehensible, except that it has terrified the French people, prevented France from destroying its destructors, but reinforced its unity, which was already in full force in the short time that has elapsed since Charlie.Amid the horror, the blood, the anxiety that have now gripped Paris, one single decision lacerates the soul as a fragile, pathetic, emotional confession of impotence: the French frontiers have been closed.L\u0027Huffington Post Editorial DirectorOne morning as I scanned the news--horror in the Middle East, Russia and America facing off in the Ukraine, I thought of Edward Snowden and wondered how he was holding up in Moscow.Makes films; Board member, Freedom of the Press FoundationAuthor, \u0027The God of Small Things\u0027 and \u0027Capitalism: A Ghost Story\u0027In this minute of silence, we will live, standing up to show that together, we will remain standing in the face of infamy, cowardice and barbarism.School PrincipalBefore jumping on the \"tough on terrorism\" bandwagon, candidates should reflect on the lessons learned in the 14 years since the 9/11 terror attacks, and consider what actually works to counter this global problem - and what doesn\u0027t.Senior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstOnce again, the ideals of freedom and peace are under attack on the very streets that helped give birth to the idea that you can’t have one without the other in modern life. Once again, President Barack Obama went to a podium in Washington to declare American solidarity with France -- and to vow that an attack on French society was an attack on the very ideas of decency, modernity and sanity.Global Editorial DirectorIt\u0027s well past 2 a.m. now and our eyes are glued to the news. We\u0027ve closed the curtains and I shake every time we hear a car go by, thinking about the Mumbai hotel attacks in 2008 that killed more than 160 and wounded hundreds.Director of Growth \u0026 Analytics, The Huffington PostThe distinction between Sanders and Clinton as being between \"socialism\" and \"capitalism\" is misleading, for the real debate is about what type of capitalism the candidates favor.Professor of sociology, University of California at BerkeleyAs I awoke this morning, thinking about the gruesome attacks in Paris last night, I reflected on the cataclysmic mistakes we made after September 11.Director of Mexico program for Global ExchangeThe problem is that, at this time of national crisis, France lacks any great leader of vision and courage. There is no De Gaulle or Clemenceau in the wings. Only Francois Hollande.Author, \"The Watchman\u0027s File\"Dissension and hate are the portals we offer to terrorism. We must close these doors and turn our focus to the mercenaries of self-interest who profit from our defeatist behaviors.Psychiatrist, interfaith harmony proponent.I don\u0027t yet know the names of any of those who died. I don\u0027t know their stories or what they did. But I know their dinner reservations, their ticket confirmations for the band they liked, the ache in their bones after a long week at work. They were friends I hadn\u0027t met yet.Editorial Assistant, HuffPost UK BlogsWe felt the floor and wall vibrate in the room where we were meeting. The management team preferred to reassure us, explaining that it was a firework. But we felt that something serious had happened.Journalism studentThe myth of the lone wolf terrorist is one that assumes terrorists are born that way. They are lifelong solitary individuals striking at a completely random target, only to disappear into the shadows, without a hint to law enforcement. But that\u0027s not always the case.Political science professor, LaGrange College in GeorgiaOn Saturday morning, after the Paris attacks, I started contacting friends. If, through some hideously random twist of fate one of my friends is injured (or worse) as this bizarre, unpredictable and violent phase of history plays out, then at I want to at least know I made the most of things with my mates.Editor-in-chief of The Huffington Post UKAs France mourns, and as Americans are drawn more and more into the struggle against ISIS, the Obama Administration and its European allies have to turn the tables on Arab states before ISIS strikes again against us.Fmr. U.S. Ambassador to Morocco; White House Middle East AdviserNo matter how obvious it seems to many of us, it will be worth repeating that it is not Muslims, immigrants or refugees who are responsible for the attacks, but handfuls of fanatics wanting us to continue down a terrible path of mistrust, exclusion and curtailment of basic freedoms.Independent source of news and analysis, from the academic and research community.In the wake of the horrific Paris attacks that claimed the lives of at least 153 innocent people, FOX News and some Republican presidential hopefuls wasted no time to fear monger and stir up some good-ol-fashioned Islamophobia.American Politics/Pop Culture Satire IG: @american__jesusWhat is the mystique of Paris that gives to many of us an inexplicably deep-rooted affection for the city? Why did yesterday\u0027s attack on Paris feel so personally hurtful, even as terrorists violate other cities and towns across the globe every day?Writer, painter, gay guy, Lymie, and artistlike person materializing fantasy and desperately seeking human souls in Washington, D.C.Moderate Muslims are the true front lines in this battle. And they need to be welcomed into our modern world, and helped in moderating the impulses of their young charges.Forbes Education Columnist; Author, \u0027How to Talk American\u0027; Director, \u0027Crotty\u0027s Kids\u0027; Co-founder, \u0027Monk Magazine\u0027Vive la vie, long live life, long live the women and men who aspire to be free and happy! No to the lovers of death, the enemies of humanity.Geneticist, doctor of medicine and doctor of science, research director at INSERMA society faced with terrorism fails at the moment it behaves exactly as the ideologies of terror predict it will. Do not grant them the satisfaction.Former president of SOS RacismeThere are many stripes of fascists afoot, and some will feign their difference from the others in order to advance their common cause: the destruction of French democracy.Political theorist - Founding Director \"Civic Inquirer\" - author of \"Civic War and the Corruption of the Citizen\" \u0026 \"Abandoned To Ourselves\"The gravity of the moment demands nothing less than the president of the United States standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the elected leaders of the free world declaring that the free people of the world will not be intimidated by terrorism or by the death and violence that it has unleashed.Best Selling Military History and World Affairs Author and Keynote SpeakerTo be sure, these most recent terrorist attacks will further exasperate already worsening anti-Muslim sentiment in France, and well beyond.We come from a background that did not promote equality. We\u0027re not sure how it occurred, who\u0027s to blame, or if we can ever truly overcome it. But shrugging it off and failing to recognize how the past has likely jaded our present makes us idiots. Claiming empathy makes us bigots.Chief Meteorologist, University of Florida Weather Center; Co-Founder, FPREN, Mizzou alumNetanyahu should not have been hosted and feted in Washington, he should have been called out by policy makers for his behavior. Until that occurs, nothing will change. Palestinians will remain invisible victims, denied their rights, and peace will remain as elusive as ever.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027America is not at risk from North Korea or even the other Asian powers Snyder cites. Washington does not need the alliance with Seoul to deter Pyongyang. Like most of America\u0027s alliances, the U.S.-ROK treaty is entirely one-sided.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteAs hard as President Obama and his Administration have worked to expand opportunity and make this a more equal country, these accomplishments would not have been possible without the advocates, allies, activists and ordinary people doing extraordinary things, to change our culture every single day.Senior Advisor to the President and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsThis week\u0027s talking points are all, essentially, rebuttals to the biggest nonsense espoused on the stage of the fourth Republican debate. It was hard to pick only seven, as there was a bumper crop of nonsense in this particular debate, so forgive us if your favorite didn\u0027t make the cut.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comMothers who experience depression and other forms of mental illness can\u0027t help what\u0027s happening to them, and surely they\u0027re suffering. The mentally ill often aren\u0027t capable of seeing the impact of their illness on others, so all-consuming it often is.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
