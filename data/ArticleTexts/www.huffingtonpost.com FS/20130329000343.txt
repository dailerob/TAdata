{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Doug BandowSenior Fellow, the Cato InstituteSecretary of State John Kerry made a surprise visit to Baghdad to ask the Iraqi government to stop helping Iran support Syria\u0027s Bashar al-Assad. Kerry received an embarrassing rebuff--so much for the Bush administration\u0027s celebrated victory over Saddam Hussein. This time ten years ago the grand Iraqi cakewalk had begun. American military forces were racing toward victory. The world was going to be transformed. But not in the way President George W. Bush and his top officials imagined. Invading Iraq turned out to be one of Washington\u0027s greatest strategic mistakes. Yet even now many of the Iraq War\u0027s architects are clamoring for more wars. America needs peace. War should be a true last resort, not just another policy option for frustrated social engineers and impatient internationalists. Wars are sometimes tragically necessary. But not in Iraq.Comments (115)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistI don\u0027t know about you, but I love when spring comes around and I can start thinking about all the fresh fruits and vegetables that are coming into season. Strawberries, artichokes, pineapples, avocados and asparagus are all in season right now and ready to take center stage on the table.CommentsDr. Maya RockeymooreFounder and President of Global Policy Solutions, the Center for Global Policy Solutions, and GlobalPolicy.tvBefore she decides to completely give up a career in public service, here are five things that Ashley Judd should know.CommentsThomas M. MeninoMayor of Boston; Co-chair, Mayors Against Illegal GunsAmerica\u0027s mayors know firsthand the tragic price of inaction on this issue. We\u0027re the ones who get the call at 3 a.m. after one of our police officers has been shot and killed in the line of duty, or a young person\u0027s life has been cut short by a stray bullet.Comments (190)Ann BrenoffSenior Writer, The Huffington PostWhen I was in my 20s and 30s, I specialized in dating bad boys. Call it the lure of the forbidden fruit or the ultimate revenge on my parents; I don\u0027t actually have a good explanation of why I spent more than a decade with men who had a less-than-sterling track record in the relationship arena.Comments (371)Tom EngelhardtEditor, TomDispatch.comThese examples only begin to suggest the plethora of blood-soaked little anniversaries that Americans could observe, if they cared to, from a decade-plus of the former Global War on Terror that now has no name, but goes on no less intensely.Comments (17)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesOne of the most idiotic and offensive statements to come out of the Supreme Court marriage equality arguments -- and there were a few -- was when Justice Alito claimed during the Prop 8 arguments that the Internet and cellphones are older than same-sex marriage.Comments (132)Leslie Spry, M.D., FACPNational Kidney Foundation spokesperson; Medical director, Dialysis Center of Lincoln, Neb.While some habits are commonly accepted as unhealthy, there are other everyday behaviors that don\u0027t seem harmful but in actuality may be damaging your body. Could you be harming your kidneys without realizing it?Comments (41)Nathaniel FrankAuthor, \u0027Unfriendly Fire: How the Gay Ban Undermines the Military and Weakens America\u0027Whatever the outcome of this week\u0027s historic Supreme Court hearings on same-sex marriage, one thing has become crystal clear: there is no longer, if there ever was, a rational argument to ban it. Are there any grounds for holding that position beyond simple prejudice?Comments (64)Lauren ParkerWriterWhat my ex said to me one afternoon that made me realize the relationship was over.Comments (46)Adam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; founder of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911Every time you go to a new doctor or dentist and they give you a clipboard brimming with documents to fill out and sign, notice how they always ask for your Social Security number? Do you dutifully give it up? Did you ever wonder if they really need it?Comments (109)Jim WallisChristian leader for social changeWhen did we trade the idea of public servants for the false idols of power and privilege? When did we trade governing for campaigning? And when did we trade valuing those with the best ideas for rewarding those with the most money?CommentsKevin A. HansenAuthor of the bestselling Secret Regrets book series; founder of SecretRegrets.comNothing rocks a marriage likes infidelity, and quite often the result is divorce. But once the truth comes out, do the cheating spouses regret the affair -- or just regret getting caught?Comments (96)Annette InsdorfDirector of undergraduate film studies, Columbia University, and author of PHILIP KAUFMANBlancanieves is Pablo Berger\u0027s magical Spanish transposition of the Snow White myth into the thrilling arena of bullfighting and flamenco.CommentsGeoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoKnowing exactly what is motivating any particular question is a tricky business and prognosticators often misjudge what\u0027s really going on. Having offered this caveat, let me now offer my own predictions about Perry and Windsor.Comments (230)Tim Chartier, Kevin Hutson and John HarrisThere is one statistic from the 2012 season that may be difficult to improve upon in 2013: the number of perfect games pitched in the major leagues.CommentsDavid HolmbergI\u0027ve toyed with the idea, based on covering many \"sensational\" criminal cases for various publications, that strong and protracted media scrutiny should mean that justice is better served. But I\u0027m afraid that\u0027s wishful thinking.CommentsDr. Patricia FitzgeraldWellness Editor, The Huffington Post; Doctor of acupuncture and Oriental medicine; Nutritionist; AuthorThe survival instinct designed to give us tools to fight or flee has turned on us. Now that it is on inappropriately, this response can have the opposite effect. Instead of saving our lives, it can contribute to insomnia, depression, panic attacks, and a host of other health concerns.Comments (17)Joseph BobrowFounder and president, Coming Home ProjectResearchers Dr. Frank Tortorello and Dr. William Marcellino, sponsored by the Marine Corps\u0027 Training and Education Command and Center for Advanced Operational Culture Learning, did something novel. They listened to Marines, who described in great detail their experiences of stress and distress.CommentsGordon BrownFormer Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationMalala Yousafzai and her father Ziauddin are the first two signatories of the petition to the Pakistani President following the assassination of Shahnaz Nazli yesterday. Shahnaz was a courageous teacher who joins a list of pupils and teachers shot because they wanted girls to be able to go to school and learn.Comments (149)Arianna HuffingtonI found Disconnect incredibly compelling -- a perfect use of storytelling to vividly dramatize an issue that permeates our lives to such an extent that it\u0027s hard to even see.Comments (243)Paul HogarthManaging Editor, Beyond ChronDOMA clearly violates equal protection, but the Supreme Court could repeal it on more technical grounds, ruling either that House Republicans lack standing to defend it, or that it is an attack on states\u0027 rights. But either of these less desirable outcomes would still be a victory for marriage equality.Comments (13)Rana FloridaCEO, The Creative Class Group \u0026 Author, UpgradeYou\u0027re already paying them to do a job. Why not educate them so they can do it better? It doesn\u0027t have to cost you a lot of money -- and the dividends you\u0027ll gain are incalculable.CommentsRabbi Shmuley BoteachRabbi and WriterIt\u0027s amazing how when all the ribbetting is silenced, we begin to hear an old, familiar tune: the melodious song of our own souls.CommentsLori GardBloggerThere is a picture of a mama and her kids at the park. The kids are happily playing on the playground equipment while the mom checks a message on her phone. What could she be doing? Could a very important phone call just have come in? And who are we to judge?CommentsRev. Emily C. HeathClergy, United Church of ChristHere is how a clergyperson stops a wedding from occurring in their church: they say \"no\".Comments (889)Dina FreemanBabyCenterThis week, families all over the world are getting together to share a meal in celebration of Passover and Easter.CommentsEmma Gray and Margaret Wheeler JohnsonThe volume of stories about Kardashian\u0027s body and what headlines say about it remind us how acceptable it has become to talk publicly about an individual woman\u0027s appearance in terrible ways.Comments (599)David CoatesWorrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsThey share similar names. They all promise prosperity. Nobody, after all, is going to label their budget \"the route to yet more unemployment.\" In truth, however, these are not just different budgets. They are entirely different route-maps to our collective future.Comments (294)Hemal JhaveriExecutive Director for Digital Innovation at POLITICOSo, I\u0027ve been doing some thinking. In actuality, 35 is not that different from 34, but it feels different, it feels like turning the corner into adulthood for good. And with that final turn into the world of mortgages and 401Ks, here are 35 things I wish I had done.Comments (85)Barry LevinsonAcademy Award-winning director, screenwriter and producerDuring the time of Jesus, there wasn\u0027t a pope, no cardinals, bishops or nuns. There was no Christianity during the time of Jesus.
