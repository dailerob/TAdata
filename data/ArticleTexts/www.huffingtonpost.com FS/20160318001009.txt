{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Hofstra Journalism ProfessorSince Obama\u0027s first day in office in 2009, Senator McConnell and Congressional Republicans have done all they can to block the president\u0027s agenda. They have exacerbated the divisions within this country, and regularly played on people\u0027s worst fears instead of their hopes and dreams. They have demonized and often disrespected President Obama. They have consistently put their political party ahead of their country. Their tactics have led to the emergence of Donald Trump. In fact, if Garland is not confirmed, the appointment could be filled by President Trump or President Hillary Clinton. In accepting the president\u0027s nomination, a grateful Judge Garland said, \"There can be no higher public service than serving as a member of the United States Supreme Court.\" That may be true, but he may never have a chance to do so.President Obama\u0027s environmental tenure and legacy has included both substantial steps forward and backward. He has taken a strong stance against climate deniers and saw through the Paris climate agreement. At the same time, he oversaw a massive expansion of oil and natural gas drilling, much of it by more and more dangerous and extreme methods, chiefly fracking.Oscar-nominated actor, climate change activistWriter/Filmmaker/National Geographic \"Ocean Hero\"I have always been sympathetic to more compassionate drug policies, and I thought of myself as pretty enlightened. But when I spent over three years researching my book I was startled to discover -- time and again -- that I too had fallen for a shelf-load of myths about drugs.Author of \u0027Chasing The Scream: The First and Last Days of the War on Drugs\u0027I was a successful model who experienced all of the dark issues you can imagine. I\u0027m speaking out in the hopes that others will come forward, use their voices and get the help they need. These are \"silent\" issues that shouldn\u0027t remain so.Former Model, Commercial Actress \u0026 Host turned Author, Speaker \u0026 Mental Health AdvocateIt is the silent, the inactive, who allow tyrants to have their way. I want the Democrats, the Independents and the moderate Republicans to listen. Because if we all take part in the political process, if we all speak out, if we all vote, then these few months can be an aberration in our history rather then the beginning of a disaster.Holocaust survivor, speaker, writerIn the small town of Vinh Chau there are about 700 people blind in one eye and 300 more blind in both eyes. Vinh Chau is one of the most fertile red onion production centers of Vietnam, and it is a major reason for their vision loss.Traveloguer and Asia EnthusiastMy name is Seamus, but I don\u0027t celebrate St. Patrick\u0027s Day. I\u0027m worried the holiday has become a farce, a celebration of cartoonish symbols of Irish culture that minimize, dilute and demean what it means to be Irish.Senior Producer, The Players\u0027 TribuneIf you\u0027re looking for the shared beginning of all our stories, it was one morning in July 2013. My mother left our house in Masyaf, our little mountain town, to travel to the capital, Damascus, where I lived with my father.Syrian activist and journalist based in Turkey.The civic ignorance that has pushed Trump to the top of the charts can no longer be ignored. His supporters need to know that his promises are no more plausible than the other illogical ones they have bought over the years from other candidates.Professor, Author, Columnist, and Commentator at MichaelFauntroy.com.I know we need real action, and I refuse to endorse any candidate that offers less. It\u0027s why I won\u0027t accept plans for more \"community police\" as positive solutions when it was the police that killed my son. I cannot settle for partial solutions and lip service.Mother of Tamir RiceConsidered the \"silver bullet,\" Lula is identified as the only one that can pacify the allied base. After all, Dilma and the PMDB (the main allied party) have been at a sort of cold war since before the 2014 electoral campaign.Editor in Chief at HuffPost BrasilApple is working to increase its iCloud encryption, which would inhibit even Apple itself from retrieving password-protected customer data stored in its cloud. Apple uses many arguments in defense of its position. Prominent among them states that if Apple granted to the U.S. government a way to encrypt the phones of terrorists, this move will set a precedent, and Apple will be forced to do the same for other governments.Professor of international relations, George Washington UniversityThe decision to terminate a pregnancy can be complex, it can be simple, or it can just be what is best for the person in that moment. As a doctor and abortion provider, it is my duty to convey why the right to access safe and legal abortion matters.Family physician and abortion advocateRubio\u0027s exit signals the futility of trying to rebrand the Republican Party. At the same time, it demonstrates the success of the Southern Strategy and the conservative movement to label minorities as \"dangerous others.\"Engineer, woodworker, community activist. Black Lives Matter.Bold action by the President of the United States is an important step that can help fuel the larger change necessary to finally put racial inequality in our past.Director of the Racial Wealth Divide Initiative and Host of the Race and Wealth podcast of CFEDScythian, which means \"nomad\" in Ukranian, has been described as fusing Celtic and Americana music with thunderous energy into what the band\u0027s members call \"immigrant rock.\"Entertainment WriterThe #ImamsForShe campaign is meant to empower women to educate themselves about their rights in Islam.

A lot rides on this; it\u0027s not just about Syria. It will shape the global order, one way or another.Fmr. MI-6 agent; Author, \u0027Resistance: The Essence of Islamic Revolution\u0027While terrorism is a real problem in the world, it is also one that is socially constructed as perpetrated by Muslims and Muslims alone. This leads to dangerous and problematic stereotypes and tropes of Islam and Muslims.Executive Director of the National Coalition to Protect Civil Freedoms, an organization that challenges rights abuses in the War on Terror.The growing possibility that Donald Trump will be the Republican presidential nominee is stirring a debate within the American Jewish community about how to view his candidacy, particularly in the light of his upcoming address to the AIPAC policy conference on Monday.Author, \u0027Gates of Injustice: The Crisis in America’s Prisons\u0027The nuances of foreign policy do not feature heavily in the ongoing presidential campaign. Every candidate intends to \"destroy\" ISIS; each has concerns about Vladimir Putin, North Korea, and China; every one of them will defend Israel; and no one wants to talk much about anything else.Author of the forthcoming \"Hooper\u0027s War,\" \"Ghosts of Tom Joad: A Story of the #99Percent\" and \"We Meant Well\"Gradually the narrative in mainstream media and among policymakers shifted. Conflict or civil war, not revolution or popular uprising. Rebels or insurgents, not revolutionaries or freedom fighters.Syrian-American writer based in TampaIn spite of the extreme improbably that he\u0027ll ever be in a position to catch up to Clinton on the delegate front, Sanders\u0027 campaign is still very much alive and can continue to compete from a message perspective.Democratic strategist, campaign consultant and political analyst based in Los Angeles, California.

Nowadays everything is so complicated. Nothing makes sense. People think Kevin Hart is funny. What\u0027s next? Men will want to become nurses? Ha don\u0027t make me laugh.Writer, comedian, friendDoesn\u0027t it seem like the speed of life just keeps increasing? What happened two days ago can often feel like a week ago. Sometimes our emotions can\u0027t keep up and we feel stressed and overwhelmed. It\u0027s important to learn how to slow down on the inside even if we have to move fast on the outside.President and CEO of HeartMath Inc.Before Donald repeats his claims at the annual AIPAC conference next week, maybe he should talk to some people who know a good security deal when they see one: Israel\u0027s military and intelligence leaders.President, Ploughshares Fund; Author, \u0027Nuclear Nightmares: Securing the World Before It Is Too Late\u0027The humane economy can move at lightning speed, and hit with full force.
