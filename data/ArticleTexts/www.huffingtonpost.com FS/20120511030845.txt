{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Business Editor, The Huffington PostYears from now, when historians look back at the long arc of American history, they will see in the president\u0027s announcement a significant moment. As they trace the social change that -- let us hope -- eventually came to render diversity in sexual orientation as an accepted part of what defines American society, they will absorb Obama\u0027s words as a turning point. The fact that those words came late, after the vice president\u0027s and the secretary of education\u0027s, and the fact that gay rights advocates were deeply disappointed with this president in the run-up will be mere footnotes. The short-term political context -- concern about the youth vote, balanced against the backlash from socially conservative voters in swing states -- will fade into memory, and then disappear.Read Post | Comments (71)Alec Baldwin, 05/10/12ActorAround four years ago, I met a broker at a Greenwich Village building to see an apartment. The owner was Maurice Sendak. I could tell that whether I got the apartment or not, I was going to enjoy this conversation.

While the president told me that he had no intention of making news during our now-infamous interview, by saying that his attitudes about marriage were evolving, the president did make news.

Today, I\u0027m hearing that the only thing that will drive us away from him is the issue of marriage for gays and lesbians. Both assumptions are offensive.Read Post | Comments (145)Carol Hartsell, 05/10/12Comedy Editor, The Huffington PostAt the risk of seeming insensitive as we approach Mother\u0027s Day, I have a bone to pick with everyone out there who has chosen -- or tacitly accepted -- the role of motherhood.
