{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Notice the irony of Trump benefitting from the politics of resentment. Billionaires like Trump make off with too much of the nation\u0027s income and wealth, at the expense of ordinary working stiffs. And then Trump puts on his politician\u0027s hat and cashes in on the resentment. And here\u0027s where it gets really tricky. Some of the ultra-P.C. stuff is silly and makes it easier for the right to lampoon liberals. The broader challenge here is that many of the causes that Trump and company put down as P.C. are legitimate and overdue. How long will it take before cops who brutalize black citizens are brought to justice? Do we really want to evict 12 million law abiding immigrants, many of whom were brought here as kids? But when the local working class is getting clobbered economically, it\u0027s easier to play off the races against each other.President Obama has taken the moral high ground when others would not. He has listened to the American people who are crying out for the carnage to stop when Congress would not. He has decided to be on the right side of history when others would not. He has decided to save lives when other leaders would not.Parents of Aurora victim Jessica GhawiI\u0027ll be unequivocal -- when protesters in Ferguson challenged government authority and abuse, you labeled them thugs. Guess what, it\u0027s 2016, you bunch of goddamn yokels -- you don\u0027t get to smash government property and point guns at law enforcement just because you\u0027re white.Columnist, Law StudentThe killing of Sheikh Al-Nimr should serve as a prime moment for the U.S. to reconsider its alliance with the Saudi regime, a regime that not only denies human rights to its own people but exports death and destruction abroad.Co-founder, CODEPINK: Women for PeaceMilitias are the ancestors of the modern National Guard, not of self-proclaimed \"patriots\" who show utter contempt for any form of authority beyond themselves. The extremists playing solider in the woods of Oregon are at best criminals and at worst domestic terrorists, and they need to be identified as such.International security analyst/military historian. Prof. of History, DePaul University, teaches counter- terrorism courses around the world.America has succumbed to a vicious cycle in which great wealth translates into political power, which generates even more wealth, and even more power. The result of this vicious cycle is a disenfranchisement of most Americans, and a giant upward distribution of income from the middle class and poor to the wealthy and powerful.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027Trump appears to have relented to requests for his favorite passages in the Bible by sharing, \"Proverbs, the chapter \u0027never bend to envy.\u0027\" But the trouble is that it\u0027s not entirely clear that Trump\u0027s favorite Bible verse is actually in the Bible.Associate Professor, Religion Department; Director of Undergraduate Research in the Arts \u0026 Humanities, Trinity UniversityClimate change is a moral issue, a health issue, and a jobs issue -- and that\u0027s why the strong majority of Americans want the federal government to do something about it, and support the strong outcome in Paris. We\u0027ve got a lot more work to do, and we\u0027re not slowing down.Administrator, U.S.Environmental Protection AgencyReagan likely would find the entire discussion a bit, well, \"liberal\" in the sense of assuming that more dollars spent is the only way to deliver more security.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteIt\u0027s not enough for individual believers to worship God as they see fit -- a right which I and most Americans are happy to acknowledge and protect. According to Scalia, the government must place its thumb on the scale and promote and advance religion over non-religion.President \u0026 CEO, Center for Inquiry; Author of The Necessity of SecularismSexual assault often disempowers survivors and steals our voice and humanity. When we are able to reclaim the pieces of us that were desecrated, such as our trust, joy, hope, faith, and sense of safety, then that is an aspect of justice.Psychologist, minister, author of Tweets for the Soul: When Life Falls Apart a resource for people in the process of exiting toxic mindsets, relationships, and situations.Extremists from America\u0027s far right wing have carried out well over half of the deadliest terror attacks on American soil since 9/11. Experts on terrorism agree, but argue that some conservative politicians downplay this fact. The question is why?Sr. Investigative Reporter WGBH Radio Boston; Sr. Fellow Schuster Institute for Investigative JournalismAs we continue to push for police and criminal justice reform in this new year, let us not forget that places like Cleveland and West Palm Beach face March primaries where voters can express their outrage at the polls. We must take the frustration that we express in the streets through peaceful protests to the voting ballot box, for that is how we can hold accountable those that are supposed to serve us.President, National Action NetworkThe descent of the Republican presidential debate into new lows of demagoguery highlighted the emptiness of political discourse. And across the country, communities experienced the torrential downpours, record temperatures, floods, droughts, and firestorms predicted by climate change models. But 2015 also brought breakthroughs.Co-Founder and Editor at Large, YES! MagazineHow satisfying would that be to learn that the nine episode arc is really, underneath it all, about the Kenobi family and not the Skywalkers?Founder and Creative Director, Wide Eye CreativeScalia\u0027s views are precisely what our forefathers feared so terribly and worked so diligently to avoid. In addition to ignoring our Bill of Rights, Scalia has abandoned any pretense of logic to support his faith.Scientist and former White House Senior Policy Analyst; Ph.D. in marine biology/neurophysiologyIt\u0027s unrealistic to expect that you can create a life that is 100% happy moments. Chasing a problem-free life actually makes you unhappy because every bump in the road is viewed as evidence of failure. A better goal is to increase your happiness by 20%. Here are three ways to do it:Creator of Noble Purpose in business conceptThe Republican campaign has deteriorated into a schoolhouse brawl. This is not a campaign of new and exciting ideas; rather, it is a misguided crusade that offers voters little hope for those tired of politics as usual.Hofstra Journalism ProfessorWith the Paris framework in place, momentum for bottom-up, decentralized market-based policies will only increase -- and at the core of such systems are transparency and integrity.President of the Environmental Defense FundAs President Obama prepares to deliver his final State of the Union address on January 12, it\u0027s difficult to remember how incredibly bad the economy was when he took office seven years ago and how important financial reform is to getting the economy working again for all Americans.President and CEO, Better Markets, Inc.The fear of the \"other\" is starting to define Western politics and it is not just about Trump. The rise of right-wing political parties in Europe, from Hungary to Denmark, is a poignant reminder of the breadth of this phenomenon. Yet, outside the West this fear of the other also permeates and often dominatesStrategist and political analystIf at least some American politicians and a significant portion of the public can see that Trump\u0027s proposal can be used to recruit terrorists, why can\u0027t they see that the U.S. government\u0027s post-9/11 attacks on or invasions of at least seven Muslim countries is far worse?Senior Fellow and Director of the Center on Peace \u0026 Liberty, The Independent InstituteBefore there was \"Dr. Google,\" there was \"Dr. Grandma\". Even though these women didn\u0027t typically go to medical school, they often had good advice -- such as \"eat your vegetables,\" and \"go out and play.\" But when it came to health advice during the winter months, it\u0027s a mixed bag.Former Chief Medical Expert and VP, Health and Medical Education at Discovery Channel\"The first thing I would do is break up the banks so that they are much smaller and they could all fail.\"Movie critic, corporate governance analystThe success of The Force Awakens should have been celebrated as an unreserved triumph for Carrie Fisher and yet, the movie not yet three weeks in theaters, it is instead dragging out old issues that she\u0027s struggled with her entire life.Writer and blogger, grahamscrackers.comDoes pain keep you up at night? How do you handle your pain? Does your mattress play a role in your pain management?WriterNimr\u0027s execution is a dangerous move by the Saudi authorities, but not a surprising one. Although some western politicians and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon had called for his release, the United States government has been predictably and disappointingly muted about criticizing its rich Gulf ally.Director, Human Rights First\u0027s Human Rights Defenders ProgramThe key point here is that the occupying nation-state and its military organization allowed and ran the comfort facilities. It doesn\u0027t matter who the individual victims were.Attorney at GRM LawMy NICU days are over. I could not handle the loss of another mother\u0027s baby. I offer support to other mothers who share my grief of losing a child to addiction. I speak out against the stigma that prevents addicts from getting the treatment they need and deserve. I pray that someday I will find peace knowing that Matt is safe, and I hope to forgive myself.Registered nurseLooking forward, the only way we -- Muslims and non-Muslims -- are going to conquer misinformation and extremism, is by working together. We can build peace, but we must build it together.Visiting Fellow, Harvard University\u0027s Prince Alwaleed bin Talal School of Islamic StudiesSooner or later we\u0027ll be treated to a peroration by some gun nut about how these valiant freedom fighters are a living example of the sanctity of 2nd-Amendment rights.Mike the Gun GuyGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
