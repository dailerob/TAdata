{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersThe ability for ordinary working people to organize and collectively bargain over their wages and working conditions is a fundamental human right. It is a right just as critical to a democratic society as the right to free speech and the right to vote. Over the last 30 years many in corporate America and the big Wall Street banks have conducted a sustained attack on that human right. Unionization dropped from 20.1 percent of the workforce in 1983 to 11. 3 percent in 2013 -- and the results are there for everyone to see. The simple fact is that absent government regulation and collective bargaining agreements, the market by itself does not assure that everyone shares in the fruits of society\u0027s increased economic productivity. In fact, we know that just the opposite is true.As my cousin Carol\u0027s condition worsened, she asked her own questions. \"How do I want to be remembered? How do I handle my unresolved issues? What messages do I want to leave for my loved ones?\" Together we embarked on a sacred journey filled with meaningful moments and a lot of hard work.Author, \u0027Room 732\u0027In his broadside against President Obama, Dick Cheney fails to grasp the central irony of his situation. Cheney wants us to respond to his cries of \"fire,\" but does not understand that all we see when he speaks is the arsonist.President, Fiscal Strategies GroupThey couldn\u0027t find anything for the DTaP vaccine or the HIB vaccine. They couldn\u0027t find any association with autism. And they couldn\u0027t find any risk from giving a lot of vaccines at once; in fact, one study found that getting several vaccines may help protect children against leukemia.Pediatrician, Boston Children\u0027s Hospital, Harvard Medical SchoolSince the middle of May, Nicole and several of the other Sandy Hook family members have called your office multiple times a week requesting a meeting to discuss an important piece of legislation -- legislation that if passed, could prevent a similar tragedy or lessen the loss of life. You ignored them at every turn.Chief Creative Officer, IDThe top five oil and gas companies alone made over $1 trillion in the past decade. That\u0027s over $250 million per day. The fossil fuel industry is destroying the planet with impunity and getting rich while doing it. That must end.Independent U.S. Senator from VermontThe cold-blooded murders of the three abducted Israeli boys must not go unpunished. But justice, not vengeance, should win the day. The murderers should be tracked down, apprehended and tried in court for their crimes.JournalistOur relationship used to be a give and take. But from now on, this relationship is a one-way street. I own you for all the great things you can bring my life, but you don\u0027t own me in return. I will look up. I will stop. I\u0027ve got to re-engage in the world instead of feeling engaged to you.Emmy® award-winning journalist and “Talk Stoop” hostWhatever little remained of the \"compassionate conservatism\" championed by George W. Bush has long since evaporated under the heat of Republican extremism. Today, more than three-quarters of American conservatives think the poor \"have it easy.\"Professor Emeritus, Union Institute \u0026 UniversityAn enormous gap has emerged about what liberty means today. The debate drives vastly different visions of where the country is headed. What should unite us, divides us. Unnecessarily, as it turns out. There\u0027s common ground if we want to find it.Senior Fellow, DemosPeople who feel isolated and powerless cease to be creative and productive. These are immutable truths. And we can only start to solve them when address our feelings of distress with the respect they deserve.Author, \"The Athena Doctrine: How Women (And The Men Who Think Like Them) Will Rule The Future\"Author, writer, horsemanThis is a terrible story in every way. It is tempting, given these details, to reinforce the belief that the dogs have dangerous tendencies. That\u0027s the conclusion that the Boston Globe editorial board came to, certainly, in a profoundly wrongheaded, and unsigned, editorial called \"Pit bull owners: know your breed.\"Editor, HuffPost DCWith the Supreme Court\u0027s Holly Lobby decision, an ugly piece of history is being repeated. Religion is being used as a tool to take away freedom. Discrimination is not Christian. Discrimination is sin.United Church of Christ ministerFollowing the horrific murders of Israeli and Palestinian teens, it is time for people on both sides to rise up in silent joint and simultaneous protest against all forms of political violence.JournalistCertainly one can rightly honor the bravery of fallen soldiers no matter whether they wore blue or grey. But honoring the man\u0027s bravery or military insights is not equivalent to honoring the cause for which he fought. The cause championed by the South should cover every American with shame.Scientist and former White House Senior Policy Analyst; Ph.D. in marine biology/neurophysiologyAlthough news headlines often glibly refer to a \"war on women\" in political terms, policymakers might well devote more energy to sex trafficking -- a nightmarish war faced by the most vulnerable among us, young women who are being bought and sold for sex against their will.U.S. Senator for the State of MississippiThe first outbreak of Ebola was in 1976 -- nearly 40 years ago -- so why is there yet no cure?Associate professor of microbiology \u0026 immunology, Albert Einstein College of MedicineResearch scientist and Viral Immunology Branch Chief at U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious DiseasesYesterday, I joined about 350 people -- mostly Jewish citizens of Israel -- to pay a compassionate condolence call to the family of Mohammed Khdeir (killed by young Jewish extremists), in the tent of mourning in the Palestinian neighborhood of Shuafat, in northern Jerusalem.Director, Interreligious Coordinating Council in IsraelThe world is aflame with new or intensifying conflicts. At first glance, these upheavals appear to be driven by their own idiosyncratic circumstances. But look more closely and they share several key characteristics -- notably, a witch\u0027s brew of ethnic, religious, and national antagonisms that have been stirred to the boiling point by a fixation on energy.Author and Professor of Peace and World-Security Studies, Hampshire CollegeIt is time we inspect the basic motives to why we engage in this fight against injustice. Whether it is on grounds of human decency and equality, or because we are compelled by our faith; let\u0027s recalibrate our moral compass so it is not led astray by our tendency to strive for the sensational stories.WriterWhile government clearly plays the major role in fighting poverty through policies on things such as education, tax and trade; business creates the wealth that matters.Group Chief Executive Officer of UBSI left the detention center still in shock and thinking about this group of men. Although the US government had hurt them so much, they still identified strongly with the place where they grew up, the place where their families are, and the place where they saw their kids born.Staff Attorney at the Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project in ArizonaThe furor over Google\u0027s removal of news links in the EU will, I hope, alert people to the dangers of allowing a single, commercially motivated entity to effectively be the sole gatekeeper and organizer of the Web\u0027s information.Slifka Fellow at the Bernard L. Schwartz Center for Media, Public Policy, \u0026 Education at Fordham UniversityAll this not drinking sometimes made me want to drink. The realization that my sons would need to understand my recovery made me want to drink even more.The stuff that hooks us.Was surviving our sojourn an achievement worth noting on a resume? And more importantly, am I so terrible a travel partner as to note mere survival as a successful outcome? This would require serious thought.Writer, photographer, volunteerThe roots of this crisis go back decades, to a time when the American government thought it was more important to frustrate the Russians than to end a bloodbath. A natural question is, how long are we responsible for the sins and errors of the past?The Hispanic FanaticEmployers might not be paying much attention to the fraction of a percentage point in fees that separate many 401(k) plan providers, but they should.Director, Competitiveness \u0026 Economic Growth, Center for American ProgressDirector, Competitiveness \u0026 Economic Growth, Center for American ProgressThe average American student and teacher now spend about 30 percent of the school year preparing for and taking standardized tests. This is time that schools could use to achieve their primary purpose of educating students. Instead, they become nothing more than test factories.President of the National Education AssociationThe Murrieta protests were a shameful, sickening display of anti-immigrant sentiment. Such vigilante behavior and vitriol are out of sync with American values, and have no place in a civil society.Attorney; USA Today Columnist, NBC News ContributorWatching the film of his life, I was proud of the man on the screen and that second life he found. He was not quite the man I knew, but... I really did know, somehow, back then, that the man he would become was in there, getting ready for his \"close up.\"Reporter, Author of \u0027The Keka Collection\u0027How was my weekend? Loaded question, but thanks for asking. I actually had a very relaxing weekend. Obviously I needed it. Why obviously? Oh, had you not heard? I bike to work now. Like, every day. Twice a day if you\u0027re being specific.Humorist/Cyclist, Rejectingsobriety.tumblr.comGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"\u0027GET IT DONE\u0027",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
