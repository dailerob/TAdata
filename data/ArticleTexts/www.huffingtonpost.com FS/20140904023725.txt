President, Writers Guild of America, East.There shall be eternal summer in the grateful heart, a poet wrote, and as this year\u0027s summer winds toward its end and elections approach, gratitude is indeed what our politicians have flowing from that space where their hearts should be. As the world burns, our political class whoops it up with the plutocracy, whether in Martha\u0027s Vineyard or at the Kochs\u0027 posh retreat in southern California. They raise their Champagne toasts, quietly reinforce their networks and connections, and then return to the \"mainland\" and the pretense of once again attending to the people\u0027s business, all the while servicing the accounts that pay the campaign bills and nourish all those inside deals -- tax breaks, subsidies, contracts -- that many would call corruption but Chief Justice Roberts says are merely gratitude.These indescribably horrid beheadings were meant to send a message to President Obama, however the reverberations hit especially hard with journalists and news gathering operations everywhere.Host, \u0027Dan Rather Presents\u0027Time is running out. The more we delay, the more we will pay. Climate change is accelerating and human activities are the principal cause.Secretary-General, United NationsIf the Walton family is truly interested in helping every child achieve a high-quality education, they could begin by committing to pay their own workers a decent wage instead of spending their billions to wipe out our nation\u0027s public school system.President, American Federation of TeachersInternational President, United Food and Commercial Workers UnionMuslim warriors today unconsciously still strive to replicate the achievement of Achilles. They operate unashamedly in the reality-space of ancient concepts of kinship and the other, in which the hero serves as the instrument of shared identity celebrated and realized in battle.Professor at The Johns Hopkins University Advanced Academic Programs and the US Naval War CollegeWe will all mourn Michael Brown\u0027s death and wait to know more about what happened that night. What is clear, however, is that platitudes about \"starting a conversation\" will not do.Professor of Law at Cardozo School of LawWe are entering a world partially beyond markets where we are learning how to live together in an increasingly interdependent global Collaborative Commons. Germany and other governments around the world will need to create the appropriate legal framework to allow the sharing economy to grow.Author, \u0027The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of Things, the Collaborative Commons, and the Eclipse of Capitalism\u0027The real time bomb being set by ISIS is the implosion of Saudi Arabia as a foundation stone of the modern Middle East.Fmr. MI-6 agent; Author, \u0027Resistance: The Essence of Islamic Revolution\u0027We\u0027ve become a society that feels entitled to the nudity of others; consent is not required, just as long as we get our fill of flesh.Writer, bloggerFive dogs. 12 weeks. Increased compassion. Better sleep. More patience. Peace of mind. Improved relationships. Smiles. Opened hearts. Expressed emotions. More unconditional love. At a maximum security prison. And the dogs didn\u0027t charge for their services.Wellness Editor, The Huffington Post; Doctor of acupuncture and Oriental medicine; Nutritionist; Animal Welfare AdvocateIn many ways, American conservatism owes its existence and its longevity as much to the vast wilderness landscape that greeted our forefathers as it does to European thinkers like Edmund Burke and Adam Smith.President of Conservatives for Responsible StewardshipAmericans prefer to believe that all problems have solutions. There may, however, be no obvious or at least immediate solution when it comes to ISIS, an organization based on exclusivity and divisiveness in a region that couldn\u0027t be more divided.Editor, TomDispatch.comFor me, a family vacation\u0027s always a bit like my Moroccan chicken: I\u0027m never exactly sure how it\u0027s going to turn out.Senior Editor, HuffPost 50Don\u0027t be fooled by the promises of riding your way to good health and a slim figure on a river of ice cream and butter. Stick with what scientists have known for decades: A low-fat, plant-based diet is decidedly best for our health.President, Physicians Committee for Responsible MedicineAmericans\u0027 love affair with beef has consequences beyond our borders. According to Boucher\u0027s 2012 study, U.S. beef consumption helps drive tropical deforestation, which is now responsible for about 10 percent of the world\u0027s carbon emissions. As demand for beef goes up worldwide, so does deforestation.Director of News \u0026 Commentary, Union of Concerned ScientistsIf choosing a partner is such an important life decision, why do so many of us get it wrong?Author, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027If you are not particularly worried about being high-minded here, there is another consideration, which is, by looking at the pictures, you are giving criminals a purpose for their act (at least with a degree or so of separation) and causing someone distress. Is it really worth it?Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911Jokes are made about the salivating, ugly Americans ogling topless sunbathers at European beaches, but the schizophrenic nature of our country\u0027s relationship with sex has passed from laughable to lamentable to downright detrimental.Sass \u0026 SensibilityAmerican reporter James Foley, who was killed in Syria in August, was -- and is -- a brother to me. As courageous as Jim was, however, I don\u0027t think that it was danger or violence that drew him to this harrowing work. Rather, it was peoples\u0027 storiesPoet and AuthorThese are dark times for America\u0027s schools. They have been subjected to a federal mandate of perpetual testing and retesting of the basic skills of reading and math.Retired high-school teacher\"You\u0027re not fat,\" he said, answering a question I hadn\u0027t asked. \"You just need to tone up.\" I stood in my bikini at the lake\u0027s edge and froze. I wished I could sink into the sand and never re-emerge.Zen copywriter. Streak-free mind.So just how dry is California? According to tree ring data from the University of California at Berkeley, in some parts of the state, it hasn\u0027t been this drought-stricken since the year 1580.Broadcaster, Conservation BiologistThe NFL is a league that tolerates homophobia, the lofty words of its officials notwithstanding. And until LGBT groups and politicians stand up and take it on rather than cowering, homophobia will continue to get a pass.Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesDespite the success of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, America is not benefiting from its full potential. The law allows for $900 million to be used each year. Only rarely have annual funding levels approached that amount despite it being only a fraction of the billions oil companies pay in in royalties.Senator Edward J. Markey of MassachusettsMany on both sides of the aisle agree that work should be a ladder out of poverty. The problem is that too often conservatives like Rep. Paul Ryan argue that all you have to do to get a job is want a job.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorIf we fall into the trap set by ISIS, our country will have proven that its attention span is not only short, but also captivated by terrorist propaganda and lured into costly wars by terrorist strategies.Author and Journalist published in Salon.com, the Jerusalem Post, Chicago Tribune, The Hill\u0027s Congress Blog, and other publications. www.hagoodman.comOnly about 210 million acres of true wilderness remain in America. Roughly half of those have been protected under the Wilderness Act, but the rest remain vulnerable to the pressures of mining, logging, and especially energy development.President, NRDCThe way we see it, busyness is a seductive trap too many of us fall into. While getting out isn\u0027t easy, or necessarily comfortable, it\u0027s the only path to living a more intentional, focused and productive life. Or as Arianna calls it -- it\u0027s the only way to thrive.Co-Founder, Stop Meeting Like This\"Climate Change is accelerating and human activities are the principal cause,\" the Secretary-General declares. So does Lyn Lear, as agitated and exhausted as if she, too, was convening a Climate Summit at the United Nations in New York on September 23.Founder, People for the American WayThe lack of women and minorities in philosophy may be an anomaly in the academy, especially among the humanities, but it is not an accident.Real World Issues, Academic InsightsWhether you marry someone of the same sex, of the other sex, or somewhere in between. Whether you wear a white dress or a blue feather boa. Whether you are married in a church by a priest or by yourselves under the moon with only the waves as the officiant.
