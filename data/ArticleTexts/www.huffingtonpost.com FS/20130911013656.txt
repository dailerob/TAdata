{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jason LinkinsEditor, Eat the PressAs our national debate over how little we can get away with doing in response to the Assad regime\u0027s use of chemical weapons while still being able to credibly say that we\u0027ve done something rages, we have apparently entered the \"another county heard from\" stage of the discussion. I say this because, for some reason, billionaire casino mogul and quixotic campaign donor Sheldon Adelson has shown up on the scene, and he says he\u0027s ready \"to roll up his sleeves and help Obama\" with this whole Syria thing. In an interview with the National Journal, Adelson said, \"I would be willing to help out the administration because I believe it\u0027s the right thing to do. He is our only -– we don\u0027t have any other commander in chief.\" Presumably, he looked around for another one, at the sports book or something, but came up short.Comments (118)Dennis J. KucinichFmr. 16-year Member of US Congress; Two-time US Presidential CandidateWe\u0027ve seen this movie before and it doesn\u0027t end well. A decade after the Bush administration used the CIA\u0027s \"yellow cake\" tale and other faulty evidence, the government is yet again relying on the CIA to lead a domestic propaganda effort for military action in Syria.Comments (381)Katharine FraseCTO, IBM Global Public SectorThis is the era of the city. It is also the era of the Millennial. With a growing population of bright, diverse, wired and connected young people who really care about where they live, the two are ideal for each other, but our cities must keep up in attracting the prized demographic.Comments (1)Dan DennettCognitive scientist and philosopherLeon Wieseltier sees that the humanities are in a deep crisis, but his essay, \"Crimes against the Humanities,\" is not a helpful contribution to its resolution. Name-calling and sarcasm are typically the last refuge of somebody who can\u0027t think of anything else to say to fend off a challenge he doesn\u0027t understand and can\u0027t abide.Comments (16)Jennifer BallMom, writer, teacher, lover of dirty martinis and yoga pantsWomen like me didn\u0027t make an agonizing choice between a high-paying, satisfying career and motherhood. Women like me, we basically went from friends to parenthood. Some of us have degrees, some of us never finished college. Some of us never started.Comments (787)Arianna HuffingtonIn practically every religious tradition and practice, giving of oneself is a key step on the path to spiritual fulfillment.Comments (111)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Five years ago this month Wall Street almost went under. We bailed it out. Millions of Americans are still suffering the consequences of the Street\u0027s excesses. Yet the Street\u0027s top guns and fat cats are still treating the economy as their own private casino, and raking in even more than before.Comments (220)Jessica Ciencin HenriquezFreelance Writer and Author of the upcoming novel, Lies I\u0027ve Told My Therapist.There is no doubt that female friendships hold hefty value in my life, but friendships with women exhaust me in a way that male friendships never have. They simply offer different things.Comments (460)Suzanne GuilletteWriter, teacher and author, \u0027Much to Your Chagrin: A Memoir of Embarrassment\u0027On the occasion of the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, I am revisiting my thoughts on the diversity of responses to public tragedies; whether disbelief, anger, fear or ambivalence, they are beautifully reflective of our humanity.CommentsHarvey FiersteinMultiple Tony-Award-winning actorWhat makes Putin\u0027s war on homosexuals so frightening is that the methodology is perfectly simple. His recipe is time-tested and depends, almost entirely, on the most dependable truth of all -- human nature.Comments (173)Rep. Tulsi GabbardU.S. Representative from Hawaii\u0027s Second Congressional DistrictI have concluded that intervention in Syria goes against America\u0027s national security, international credibility, economic interest, and moral center.Comments (106)Robert ScheerEditor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027It came when President Obama acknowledged the Russian proposal for Syria to avert war by agreeing to destroy its chemical weapons stock as \"a potentially positive development.\" It was quintessentially an un-Bush moment when suddenly this presidential \"decider\" seemed possessed of a brain capable of reversing his disastrous course.Comments (311)Oliver Stone and Peter KuznickWhitewashing the past is critical to perpetuating empire in the present -- a project in which the U.S. and Japan have collaborated for the past 68 years.Comments (34)Carina KolodnyWriter, sex educator, media activistWhen you have the \"avoid getting raped\" conversation with your daughter, it is difficult, as you don\u0027t want to imagine her as a victim. The idea of having the \"don\u0027t rape\" conversation with your son is more difficult as you don\u0027t ever want to imagine him as a perpetrator. Do it anyway.Comments (436)Bruce WeinsteinThe Ethics GuyTwo new iPhones are about to flood the market. I -- and maybe you too? -- join millions of people around the world who can\u0027t wait to own one. We\u0027ll be able to do things faster and better than before, so what\u0027s the downside?CommentsJim HigleyBobblehead Dad; Author; Speaker; Parenting Columnist; Radio Host; Cancer WarriorThe cynic in me was looking for something missing. There had to have been a catch. But there wasn\u0027t.Comments (20)Derek AbbottPhysicist and electronic engineerRemember how irrational numbers petrified the bejesus out of the Pythagoreans? Or the interminable time it took mankind to introduce a zero into arithmetic? Recall the centuries of debate that occurred over whether negative numbers are valid or not?Comments (50)Jedediah PurdyProfessor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027Our economy does a lot of sorting. It creates winners and losers, over and over, and it comes dressed in ideas, about the rationality of markets and the merit of merit, that tell the winners they are winners and the losers they are losers. In this way, our economy destroys solidarity.CommentsWilliam BaldwinActorApollo, Poseidon, Zeus... all the Gods are smiling down from the heavens as a result of the IOC\u0027s decision to reinstate wrestling back into the Olympic Games.CommentsRoger WrightAuthor, \u0027Finding Work When There Are No Jobs\u0027What if reading Elmore Leonard, F. Scott Fitzgerald or any great author could help you find a job?Sounds crazy. Or at best a gimmick. Until you start thinking about what really helps people find jobs.CommentsRana FloridaCEO, The Creative Class Group \u0026 Author, UpgradeIt\u0027s time to kill the breakfast meeting. Kill it dead. I seriously think the first breakfast meeting was convened by a bitter boss who was unhappy with their family life, couldn\u0027t wait to get out of the house in the morning, and wanted to inflict pain on subordinates.Comments (29)Peter Alexander MeyersPolitical theorist and author of \u0027Civic War and the Corruption of the Citizen\u0027President Obama\u0027s call for military intervention is compelling because, as he said, \"the moral thing to do is not to stand by and do nothing.\" This moral claim is misleading. Although government may pursue humanitarian goals, it is not a humanitarian agency.Comments (141)Joshua M. BrownAuthor, Backstage Wall StreetWhat led to me beginning CrossFit was a realization that, if left to my own devices, I would never push myself hard enough to truly make the changes I needed to in order to get in shape.Comments (953)Jeff FauxFounder and now Distinguished Fellow at the Economic Policy InstituteOn the merits, Barack Obama has already lost the Congress on his proposal to intervene in the Syrian Civil War. What\u0027s left is an argument on the politics.CommentsAdam GreenCo-founder, Progressive Change Campaign Committee (BoldProgressives.org)Tonight, President Obama has the burden of proving that America has a concrete goal in Syria and that declaring war is the only way to achieve that goal.CommentsJeffrey SachsDirector, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \"To Move the World: JFK\u0027s Quest for Peace\"\"There\u0027s always some son-of-a-b**ch who doesn\u0027t get the word,\" John F. Kennedy exclaimed in frustration.

Did you know that once a female sees you in a state of undress, she can\u0027t ever un-see it? You don\u0027t want my daughter to only think of you in this sexual way, do you?Comments (1,044)Caz Craig MakepeaceMake it your mission to learn as much as you can and engage with those around you.
