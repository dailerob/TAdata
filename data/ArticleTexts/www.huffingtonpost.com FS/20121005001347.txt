{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editorial Director, Huffington Post Media GroupSomething is not quite right with President Barack Obama. That was clear long before his passive, distracted performance here Wednesday night against Mitt Romney. The president needs to get back some form of his old magic if he hopes to secure a victory that, until the Denver debate, seemed all but inevitable, even to many of his foes. The evidence of the president\u0027s distance and distaste for the campaign is everywhere. He is invisible around Washington, a place he clearly doesn\u0027t like and where he has made few new political friends. He mailed in his acceptance speech in Charlotte, N.C., looking at the end like a man who couldn\u0027t wait to get off the stage. He has dutifully hit the campaign trail, but not with the zest or the frenzied response of 2008. And he clearly didn\u0027t master his brief for the debate when he went to ground in Las Vegas, though he did take time for a day trip to Hoover Dam. What gives?Read Post | Comments (1,220)Bob Herbert, 10/04/12Former New York Times columnistIt\u0027s time to stop making excuses for Barack Obama. With so much at stake in this election, his performance at the debate on Wednesday night was indefensible.Read Post | CommentsBob Cesca, 10/04/12Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez Show, Media ProducerMitt Romney won the debate last night but only if you judge the \"winner\" of a debate as the most hyperkinetic, oftentimes aggressive and condescending participant who used his rehearsed delivery to spackle over his lies, mistakes, generalities and misleading statements.Read Post | Comments (593)Marlo Thomas, 10/04/12Award-winning actress, author, and activistThree books at the top of the bestseller list, all at the same time? Who is this woman? So when I sat down with E. L. James for an exclusive interview, I had a lot of questions about the book, the bondage and the inspiration behind the global phenomenon.Read Post | Comments (29)Robert Reich, 10/04/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027In Wednesday night\u0027s debate, Romney won on style while Obama won on substance. Romney sounded as if he had conviction, which means he\u0027s either convinced himself that the lies he tells are true or he\u0027s a fabulous actor.Read Post | Comments (1,080)Dr. Michael J. Breus, 10/04/12Clinical Psychologist; Board Certified Sleep SpecialistOverwork and little sleep can affect every aspect of our lives, from relationships, job performance and daily wellbeing to our fundamental health. A new study suggests that difficult and demanding work schedules also can contribute to obesity.Read Post | CommentsKathleen Reardon, 10/04/12Professor, USC Marshall School; Author, \"The Secret Handshake\" and \"Comebacks At Work\"Voters who support Obama need to see him want to be reelected. They want him to show that passion and desire. He isn\u0027t standing at that podium only for himself.Read Post | Comments (16)John Dear, 10/04/12Jesuit priest, pastor, peacemaker, organizer and author of \u0027Lazarus, Come Forth!\u0027What is our response to our nation\u0027s massacre of eight women -- and the hundreds of other women and children we\u0027ve killed in Afghanistan? Think of their lives. Think of their poverty. Think of them walking in the dark before dawn.Read Post | CommentsMarty Kaplan, 10/04/12Director, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolThe Barack Obama who showed up at the first debate looks more than a little like the kumbaya campfire singer who in his first term kept turning the other cheek to Republicans whose goal was to delegitimize and destroy him.Read Post | Comments (26)Lord Weidenfeld of Chelsea, 10/04/12Founder and chairman of Weidenfeld \u0026 NicolsonA Europe, which is withdrawn into itself, and a policy of withdrawal on the part of the American President, in view of the whole world, facilitate foreign-policy adventures and claims of hegemony of various players in the region and its surroundings.Read Post | Comments (69)Lynn Taliento, 10/04/12Partner, McKinsey \u0026 Company, Social SectorCompetition: it\u0027s the life\u0027s blood of the American economy. So how about a contest to help solve one of the country\u0027s most intractable problems -- the jobs crisis that has left more than 20 million Americans out of work or underemployed?Read Post | CommentsRussell Simmons, 10/04/12Founder, GlobalGrind.comI will continue to spread the president\u0027s agenda, because I believe he will make it his legacy issue to get the money out of politics, so all Americans, not just a percentage of them, will have access to the American Dream.Read Post | CommentsDominique de Villepin, 10/04/12Fmr. Prime Minster of FranceAmerica has it in its guts to accomplish a needed inner transformation, to become the seed of a global evolution of our common world, to become a second generation power, an evolved power capable of doing what no other power has done before: sharing power after having reached its peak.Read Post | Comments (14)Rev. Al Sharpton, 10/04/12President, National Action NetworkWe cannot allow 50 years of progress since the day James Meredith enrolled in the University of Mississippi to be erased with one ruling. Far too much is at stake for us to remain silent.Read Post | Comments (25)Lynn Parramore, 10/04/12AlterNet Editor; Co-founder, Recessionwire; Founding Editor of New Deal 2.0Last night I placed a five-dollar bill into a bowl at the start of the debate, clipped to a prediction that Romney would be declared the winner. Not because I think that Romney is a better debater, or that I feared Obama would make a horrible gaffe -- but because that\u0027s how The Script has to go in these cases.Read Post | Comments (243)Rep. Maxine Waters, 10/04/12Congresswoman from California\u0027s 35th DistrictUnfortunately, the Republican ticket continued its incoherence on financial reform with Romney\u0027s comments last night.Read Post | CommentsX PRIZE Foundation, 10/04/12Solving the world’s Grand ChallengesThe new era of space travel will be known for democratizing space travel, moving it into the private sector, and making it available to the general public, rather than just a few highly trained and government-employed specialists.Read Post | CommentsMike Lux, 10/04/12Partner, Democracy PartnersThe real story of last night\u0027s debate reinforces the fact that Democrats are winning the overall debate in this race, because the way Romney won last night was by acting like a Democrat -- and by being a stunningly blatant bald-faced liar.Read Post | Comments (114)Dr. Judith Rodin, 10/03/12President of the Rockefeller FoundationIn the world of finance, ROI -- \"return on investment\" -- rules the day. But there is a new kind of investor nowadays seeking a different kind of return. We call them impact investors, and they seek to put markets to work for millions of people around the globe.Read Post | Comments (20)Merle Hoffman, 10/04/12Award-winning journalist and author of Intimate Wars: The Life and Times of the Woman who Brought Abortion from the Back Alley to the BoardroomAfter debating every major \"right-to-life\" leader in this country, I didn\u0027t need to watch the debate tonight to know that no matter who the pundits say won, it is women who are losing. Indeed the debate was mute on the subject of women.Read Post | Comments (206)Amitai Etzioni, 10/04/12GWU ProfessorIf you are concerned about the tons of money that flow into our elections and the campaigns that drag on and on, but are told there is no way to limit the amount of dough involved -- have a look at the way the Europeans do it.Read Post | CommentsJim Sleeper, 10/04/12Lecturer in Political Science, Yale UniversityObama has stopped speaking the truth, I think, because what he has seen of America since 2009 has broken his heart.Read Post | Comments (143)Brad Hill, 10/04/12WriterIf this had been an audition for a dramatic role as president, President Obama wouldn\u0027t get a call-back. He was sluggish; his responses amorphous and dissolute. Romney was quick and precise.Read Post | Comments (356)Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner, 10/04/12Executive Director/CEO and Co-Founder of MomsRising.orgLet\u0027s face it: Both Romney and Obama missed a chance to win over women and mom voters. Somehow the debate happened without either candidate uttering the word \"women,\" much less talking about economic policies which significantly impact women.Read Post | CommentsCharles Pelkey, 10/04/12Wyoming Attorney, Former Journalist, Breast Cancer SurvivorWith those words, I joined the elite ranks of the 1 percenters. Alas, not those who\u0027ve been the focus of the Occupy Wall Street movement. No such luck on my part. No, I am among that small group of breast cancer patients who happen to pee standing up.Read Post | CommentsMichael T. Klare, 10/04/12Author and Professor of Peace and World-Security Studies, Hampshire CollegeThose like Mitt Romney who claim that the United States can achieve energy \"independence\" by 2020 or any other near-term date are only fooling themselves, and perhaps some elements of the American public.Read Post | Comments (24)Arianna Huffington, 2012. 5.10Andre E.
