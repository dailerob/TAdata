{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jason LinkinsEditor, Eat the PressThere aren\u0027t a whole lot of high-profile electoral races happening in the next few days, and the highest profile among them -- the New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial races, and the New York City mayoral race -- already seem to have an air of finality about them. At some point, the 2013-as-a-bellwether-for-2014 articles shall come and go, and then everyone can get on with their lives. But if there\u0027s one fun thing we can learn from the limited spate of election options, it\u0027s the latest in \"what losing campaigns do when they are about to lose.\"Comments (535)Bill McKibbenAuthor of a dozen books, including \u0027The End of Nature\u0027 and \u0027Deep Economy\u0027As the battle over the Keystone XL pipeline has worn on -- and it\u0027s now well over two years old -- it\u0027s illuminated the Obama presidency like no other issue. It offers the president not just a choice of policies, but a choice of friends, worldviews, styles.CommentsBrandon GorrellDirector of Editorial, Thought CatalogAugmented reality -- a live view of your environment with elements enhanced by computer-generated input -- will undoubtedly revolutionize the way we interact with the world, and even the way we drive.CommentsChristine PelosiChair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusSimply put: blackface is unacceptable. Just don\u0027t do it. For those who say it\u0027s not about race, a thought exercise: what if a black man had dressed in \"whiteface\" as a white murder victim of a black defendant? Yes, you can imagine the FOX-fueled false equivalence hysteria from here.Comments (165)Alex SimonCo-editor, The Hollywood Interview.comLou Reed has been one of rock music\u0027s most profound innovators since bursting onto the New York club scene in the mid-\u002760s with his now-legendary band, The Velvet Underground. Much of Lou Reed\u0027s career has followed this path: work that was often misunderstood upon its first release, then usually hailed as a masterpiece in retrospect.Comments (22)Shelley EmlingSenior Editor, HuffPost 50Nearly 23 years ago, I eloped with the man of my dreams, tying the knot wearing jeans and a black turtleneck in a tiny attorney\u0027s office in Antigua, Guatemala. During our first 10 years of marriage, we never failed to celebrate our anniversary in a splashy manner -- befitting of a young couple very much in love.CommentsBill Moyers and Michael WinshipFox News is its ministry of misinformation, the fake jewel of the News Corp. crown, a 24/7 purveyor of flimflam and the occasional selective truth. Look at the pounding they\u0027ve given Obama\u0027s healthcare reform right from the very start.CommentsPaul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostRecently two celebrities offered us mirror textbook cases on how not to talk about the belief -- or lack thereof -- of another.Comments (168)Mia Farrow and Daniel Jonah GoldhagenThere was a time when Mr. Obama expressed outrage over the mass murder and aerial bombardment of civilians in the Darfur region of western Sudan. Now President Obama has joined that silence.Comments (453)Greg SavageLeader of the global recruitment industryWhy do people, invited for a dinner party at 7:30, think it\u0027s cool to arrive at 8:30? It\u0027s rude. It\u0027s inconsiderate. And it\u0027s selfish.Comments (254)Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027November 5, 2014 -- Democrats surprised veteran observers by gaining two seats in the Senate, making their effective margin 57 to 43, and taking back the House. The new House of Representatives will have 236 Democrats and 199 Republicans.Comments (170)Lee BoyceFitness Writer, Strength CoachThe idea behind CrossFit is a good one -- it promotes community, the importance of strength training, compound movements, and even healthy competition. The reality of it creates grey areas, and practitioners definitely haven\u0027t seen a reduction in patients since the emergence of CrossFit hype in the real world.Comments (11)Sen. Bernie SandersIndependent U.S. Senator from VermontAs a member of the U.S. Senate Budget Committee, I am more than aware that a $17 trillion dollar national debt and a $700 billion deficit are serious problems that must be addressed. But I am also aware that real unemployment is close to 14 percent.Comments (62)Sheila MoeschenSenior Editor I AM THAT GIRL, Freelance writerHello, Mr. Ghostbuster. His barely there, tight coveralls (Coveralls, you think, quickly wracking your brain for a clever line like, \"Looks like those coveralls don\u0027t cover... all\") do little to hide the outline of his packed pecks, his astonishing abs, his tight titanium glutes.Comments (53)Jeff DanzigerPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideCommentsLynn MessinaWriterNone of this misogyny rings true for a contemporary fourth-grade boy. Fourth-grade boys in 2013 know better. First-grade boys do. My own son knows that girls can do anything boys can do. It\u0027s not even a question.Comments (604)Chris HarnickNews Editor, HuffPost TV\"The Good Wife\" has never been better. Everything literally hits the fan in \"Hitting The Fan,\" a riveting hour of TV that I wished could have lasted forever. This was not only one of the best episodes of \"The Good Wife,\" but one of the best episodes of TV.Comments (290)Len LevittVeteran police reporter and authorThirty-eight years after 15-year-old Martha Moxley was beaten to death with a golf club on the edge of her Greenwich property on Oct. 30, 1975, we are back to the original suspect, Tommy Skakel, as her likely killer.CommentsRep. Joaquin Castro, Rep. Jared Polis, Rep. Joe Garcia and Rep. Suzan DelBeneImmigration reform isn\u0027t a Democratic issue or a Republican issue. It\u0027s an issue of whether or not we, as Americans, want to open the door of opportunity to the drivers, the dreamers, the doers, the passionate people whose talents have helped build the greatest economic engine the world has ever known.Comments (17)Michelle KonstantinovskyHealth WriterI\u0027d like to reach out to those who may be like me -- the overthinkers. Those who don\u0027t need lists and to-dos because their brains are flooded with lists and to-dos. They obsess, agonize, and curse like sailors over every decision, transition, achievement, and failure.CommentsRev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkCompanies are quick to take our dollars, but slow or non-existent to invest in our business ventures, in our ideas and in our communities. It\u0027s time for a drastic change, and as the old adage goes, money talks.CommentsCarolyn GregoireFeatures Editor, Huffington Post Healthy LivingGiven the current marketing tactics employed by the yoga industry (yes, there is actually a \"Yoga Teacher Barbie\"), it\u0027s unsurprising that women, and particularly those of a certain body type, are the ones who seem to be most at home in yoga studios.Comments (30)Rosalyn FungPsychologist, bloggerAs there are many positive aspects to having a bikini body, it can equally come with a lot of costs: undesirable thoughts, feelings and behaviors, especially if the positive attributes become extreme. Here\u0027s a timeline of my changing body throughout the past four and a half years.CommentsNaoto KanFormer Prime Minister of JapanBefore the Fukushima accident, with the belief that no nuclear accident would happen as long as the safety measures were followed properly, I had pushed the policy of utilizing nuclear power. Having faced the real accident as Prime Minister, my view is now changed 180 degrees.CommentsDylan RatiganNew York Times Best-Selling author, entrepreneur and formerly the host of MSNBC\u0027s The Dylan Ratigan ShowKilling by remote is antithetical to the stakes we want to set. It is antithetical to our beliefs about ourselves. And this isn\u0027t just a matter of empathy. It is a matter of policy.CommentsJordan SchultzThe Huffington Post\u0027s sports columnist, The Schultz ReportDallas Cowboys receiver Dez Bryant\u0027s petulant, child-like antics during Sunday\u0027s 31-30 loss to Detroit showed that this is not a guy who gets it.CommentsRadley BalkoSenior Writer and Investigative Reporter, The Huffington PostThe Food and Drug Administration on Thursday recommended new restrictions on the use of some prescription painkillers. Citing a reported dramatic increase in the number of overdose deaths related to opioid-based painkillers over the last decade.Comments (832)Cara PaiukBlogger, mother and entrepreneurAs an expectant mom or new mom, you have seen this list in some form before. The \"things that no one tells you.\" Well, most of those lists are missing something. These are some of those missing gems.Comments (31)Alon Ben-MeirSenior Fellow, NYU\u0027s Center for Global AffairsIsrael\u0027s fixation on \"security\" and the harsh measures it employs, presumably to achieve an impregnable national security condition, is making the Palestinians increasingly vulnerable, fostering deeper animosity and militant resistance.CommentsRobert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Why are today\u0027s Republicans so upset with an Act they designed and their patrons adore? Because it\u0027s the signature achievement of the Obama administration. There\u0027s a deep irony to all this.Comments (1,661)Phaedra Ellis-LamkinsCEO, Green for AllThe storm drove home a somber lesson -- one that Hurricane Katrina first taught us eight years ago. When disaster strikes, those with the fewest resources have a harder time preparing, escaping, and recovering.CommentsWater for PeopleAs a social entrepreneur and a punk rock enthusiast, I see different kinds of mosh pits in my life -- particularly in the nonprofit sector where the chaos of people pushing through the crowd often results in failure.CommentsJay Weston, 2013.28.10Student Reporter, 2013.28.10Claire L.
