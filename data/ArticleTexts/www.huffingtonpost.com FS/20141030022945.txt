{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteAmerica accounts for nearly 40 percent of the globe\u0027s military outlays, but Republican Party hawks believe that the federal government never spends enough on the Pentagon. The war lobby\u0027s mantra always is more, much more. Yet the U.S. already devotes far more than it should to \"defense,\" which today largely means protecting wealthy allies who prefer to spend their money on domestic goals. Washington should scale back its international responsibilities and cut Pentagon outlays accordingly.Some things in life are self-evident. Fire burns, supply side economics doesn\u0027t work, and no Democrat, ever, under any circumstances, no matter what, should even think about offering to cut one solitary cent from Social Security, through partial privatization or means testing or raising the retirement age.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027Sleuthing led me to some astonishing and, in part, unknown characters and facts, and what began as one book grew into three.

But they are not applying for a myriad of reasons -- starting with sticker shock.Fmr. three-term mayor of New York City; Founder of Bloomberg Philanthropies and Bloomberg LPThis turn of events is just the latest in the company\u0027s ongoing campaign to control all things Internet. If the past is prologue, here\u0027s what we can expect if Verizon becomes the Internet\u0027s dictator.Senior Director of Strategy, Free PressDuring times of conflict and political or religious civil unrest, the power of the human spirit\u0027s capacity for non-violent protest and kindness still shines through.Because Kindness Changes Everything...Two years ago today, The New York stock exchange suspended trading.

And that\u0027s worth fighting for.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.I’m very excited to announce that the journey we started over a year ago in Tunisia and continued this May in Algeria has now added the final missing part -- HuffPost Morocco -- to create the full ensemble of The Huffington Post Maghreb!PetSmart\u0027s policy helps reinforce the incorrect belief that pit bulls are different from other dogs. That they are dangerous and can\u0027t be trusted, just because of the shape of their head. That they don\u0027t deserve to be treated as well as other dogs. This belief has consequences.Animal Welfare Editor, The Huffington PostTunisia is a small country with a big audience. The process of electing a parliament and a president matters, not only because it keeps the democratic process alive, but also for the signals it sends the rest of the Arab world. Tunisia, the cradle of the revolution, keeps on setting the agenda.Editor, Middle East EyePhotographer, artist, humanitarianCall it Empathy Deficit Disorder. Some Democrats have it, but the disorder seems especially widespread among Republicans.These politicians have no idea what people who are hard up in America are going through.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Medicare is very complicated, with its A, B, C and D parts, but before you decide to stay with what you have, there are three things you may not know that could influence your decision.Health policy consultant and bloggerTwo years after Sandy, few people in Manhattan are thinking about Sandy. If they are, it is like a bad dream, easily shaken off. But the nightmare continues for many in Staten Island, as I saw for myself on a recent rainy morning.Executive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostScience has a long-standing black eye for what is called the \"science to practice\" gap: the extraordinary time delays in closing the gap between what we know and what we do. There is a still a prominent gap to be closed for disaster mental health care.Medical director, New York State Office of Mental HealthWe\u0027d like to imagine that all those Halloween sweets won\u0027t affect us. But in reality, they\u0027re far from calorie-free.Those of us in higher education often say that liberal learning includes the preparation for citizenship. It\u0027s great to see an example of that preparation grounded in the collaborative work of faculty and students.President, Wesleyan UniversityThere are, of course, countless options between having no policy at all and implementing drastic quarantine and travel ban policies. Hopefully, we as Americans can reflect upon our past behaviors with epidemics in order to implement the most careful, courageous, and helpful responses to this international threat.Professor of Health Policy, Mount St. Mary\u0027s CollegeLike it or not, actors have a responsibility beyond ourselves. There are still too many young gay people growing up surrounded by hatred, and they need to see well-adjusted, successful gay people who thrive without fear. And there are too many ignorant bigots who also need to see us in all our diversity. Once they do, then maybe we really can do away with labels.Actor, writer \u0026 creator/star of web series Old Dogs \u0026 New TricksThere are beacons of hope, drum beats starting in far corners of the world, people working to change the conversation and create awareness. Nowhere is this more apparent than my home, Saudi Arabia.Her Royal Highness of Saudi Arabia\u0027Nudging\u0027 -- intentionally designing our environments to make certain decisions more likely than others -- can be an effective and ethically sound tool to help people make better decisions for themselves and for society at large.PhD Researcher in Behavioral Economics at Columbia Business SchoolChild marriage in Tanzania limits girls\u0027 access to education and exposes them to serious harms.
