{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week saw the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya that resulted in the death of four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens. It also saw Mitt Romney\u0027s reaction to the tragic events, which was to the 2012 campaign what John McCain\u0027s selection of Sarah Palin was to 2008 -- the kind of desperate act that makes even one\u0027s allies worry about their candidate\u0027s fitness to lead. It\u0027s a bell that cannot be unrung. The week also brought word that over 46 million Americans remained below the poverty line last year, while a new study found that poverty is \"nearly invisible in U.S. media coverage of the 2012 election.\" When you have 46 million people living in poverty and neither the candidates nor the media want to talk about it, you know the American Dream is in serious trouble.Read Post | Comments (297)Jeff Jarvis, 09/13/12Author, \u0027Public Parts\u0027 and \u0027What Would Google Do?\u0027The jerk who made that video, the one that supposedly incited rioting and murder in Egypt and Libya, is the very definition of a troll: He made it to elicit the reaction he was sure he\u0027d cause. That is what trolls do.Read Post | Comments (895)Valerie Plame Wilson, 09/14/12Fmr. CIA covert operations officerWe have heard riveting stories of heroism and valor from one of the soldiers who participated the mission that killed Osama bin Laden. His book is by most accounts devoid of any classified information. So are U.S. government officials angry that he wrote a book, or that his book came out before their movie?Read Post | Comments (1,446)Mohamed A. El-Erian, 09/11/12CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOCentral bankers seem to be the only policymakers both willing and able to respond to many unusual challenges. Yes they are using imperfect tools. Yes the outcomes of their actions involve collateral damage and unintended consequences. But they see all this as preferable to the alternative of doing nothing.Read Post | Comments (138)Arianna Huffington, 09/11/12Citizens\u0027 role in the needs to be more than just hoping for a good jobs number to be delivered from the Washington skies. As we enter the final lap of the election -- and the billion dollar deluge of less-than-edifying television ads that will come with it -- let\u0027s remember that we don\u0027t have to wait for Washington to act to take care of our own.Read Post | Comments (295)Neil Katz, 09/14/12Executive News Editor, Huffington Post Media GroupIf anyone but Apple released a major new product whose most unique selling point was a new accessory plug, consumers would jump ship faster than rats on the Titanic.

Declining production costs and ever-proliferating distribution options have encouraged everyone from the U.S. Navy to fringe religious groups to dabble in filmmaking, with results that range from unsettling to explosive.Read Post | Comments (601)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 09/15/12Author, research psychologist, and gender scholarBeing away from parents is a good thing.
