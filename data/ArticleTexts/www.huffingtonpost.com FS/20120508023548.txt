{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Director, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolIf more people were paying even a modicum of attention to the past, the economic debate in the 2012 presidential campaign wouldn\u0027t be between one political party beholden to big money that dreamily depicts investment bankers and oligarchs as jobs creators, and another political party, also beholden to big money, that wants applause for fixing the problem.

Just today, the news broke of a person at a question-and-answer session saying Obama should be \"tried for treason,\" and Mitt didn\u0027t even blink (much less counter the suggestion).Read Post | CommentsCara Santa Maria, 05/04/12Science correspondent, Huffington Post; editor, Talk Nerdy to MeDo we have traits that can be used to reliably predict whether someone is liberal or conservative in nature?Read Post | Comments (735)Robert Creamer, 05/06/12Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersWhen you have no core values, it\u0027s always much easier to go along with the demands of passionate, committed true-believers than it is to stand your ground.
