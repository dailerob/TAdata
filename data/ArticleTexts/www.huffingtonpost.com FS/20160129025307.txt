And today the WHO (burned by its slow response to Ebola) announced it was scrambling to put plans into action. But in the meantime, the fears are so visceral and the images so graphic that it\u0027s possible to imagine a future where easy contact begins to break down. The social and ideological stresses of the 20th century divided the world into distinct camps; now, it seems possible that we\u0027ll see a replay of those divisions, this time along epidemiological lines, and as usual making life hardest for those who have done the least to cause our problems. Zika provides a glimpse into a future we should do everything possible to avoid, a terrifying reminder why the fight for a stable physical planet is the fight of our time.The underlying truth here is that if Fox News conducted itself as an ethical news outlet, these kinds of messy spats and hurt feelings wouldn\u0027t be an issue.

This is an epidemic and a stain upon our nation -- and it is long past time that Congress took action to address it.Ranking Member, Senate Environment and Public Works CommitteeAmericans of every stripe know money corrodes our politics. In a poll last year, the New York Times and CBS found that 85 percent of us think the system for funding political campaigns should be fundamentally changed or completely rebuilt.Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyThe tragedy in Flint is a symptom of America\u0027s growing inequality, which segregates and marginalizes entire communities.Professor of Psychology, Notre DameIt\u0027s been a year since my niece, Becca, was murdered in her college room by the guy she\u0027d just broken up with.

And now he\u0027s using Rose as a way to get back at an imagined slight from another man. This shows just how fragile masculinity can be.Arts \u0026 culture journalist. Chicago is my heartbeat.If Hillary\u0027s incrementalism is too cautious for you, so be it. I will not lecture you on realism in American politics today and I\u0027d urge other aging pundits to follow my example. But, for the record, cautious politics is not equal to Wall Street shill.Fmr.
