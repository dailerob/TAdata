{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Business Editor, The Huffington PostYears from now, when historians look back at the long arc of American history, they will see in the president\u0027s announcement a significant moment. As they trace the social change that -- let us hope -- eventually came to render diversity in sexual orientation as an accepted part of what defines American society, they will absorb Obama\u0027s words as a turning point. The fact that those words came late, after the vice president\u0027s and the secretary of education\u0027s, and the fact that gay rights advocates were deeply disappointed with this president in the run-up will be mere footnotes. The short-term political context -- concern about the youth vote, balanced against the backlash from socially conservative voters in swing states -- will fade into memory, and then disappear.Read Post | Comments (100)Alec Baldwin, 05/10/12ActorAround four years ago, I met a broker at a Greenwich Village building to see an apartment. The owner was Maurice Sendak. I could tell that whether I got the apartment or not, I was going to enjoy this conversation. Just from his voice, his timing, you could tell Sendak was funny, wise, sensitive.Read Post | Comments (106)Bugeyes, 05.09.2012Founder of MenInBlackSuitsAreReal.com, Leader of MIBelieversAfter reviewing the allegations, our Editor-in-Chief sat down with ET to put the rumors of her \"ET\" origins to rest.Read Post | Comments (123)James Franco, 05/10/12Actor and authorWhat had started as a concert film about the Rolling Stones, a follow-up of sorts to the Maysles\u0027 The Beatles: The First U.S. Visit, turned into a Zapruder-like document that sounded the death knell for the flower power of the 1960s.Read Post | Comments (69)Lisa Belkin, 05/10/12Senior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, Huffington PostBreastfeeding is not a macho test of motherhood, with the winner being the one who nurses the longest.

While the president told me that he had no intention of making news during our now-infamous interview, by saying that his attitudes about marriage were evolving, the president did make news. That\u0027s where it all began.Read Post | CommentsBen Lear, 05/10/12Composer/PerformerReading the context surrounding the statement, Obama\u0027s long and deliberated evolution towards acceptance... that his final answer somehow arrived at a crucial point on the campaign trail... feels like bullshit to me.Read Post | CommentsMarjorie Hansen Shaevitz, 05/10/12Author, Founder of adMISSION POSSIBLEParents often ask, \"How can I get my son or daughter into the best, highest ranking college?\" From 20 years of working with student applicants, I have learned that this is the wrong question to ask.Read Post | CommentsHolly Cara Price, 05/10/12Agent ProvocateurOdds are, the word that pops into your mind when I mention Phil Collins is probably something like \"Sussudio.\" It\u0027s highly unlikely that the first word you\u0027d think of would be \"Alamo,\" but that\u0027s about to change.Read Post | CommentsMarlo Thomas, 05/10/12Award-winning actress, author, and activistMother\u0027s Day is approaching again, and whether your mom is still with us or gone, it\u0027s a time when we all can\u0027t help but stop for a moment, and recall all of those memories about her that we still hold in our hearts -- the touching ones, the inspiring ones, the sad ones and the funny ones.Read Post | Comments (17)Herndon Graddick, 05/10/12President, GLAADWe are asking journalists like Wolf Blitzer to hold anti-gay activists like Tony Perkins accountable for their own statements against LGBT people, and to deliver that critical information to their audiences.Read Post | Comments (12)Soraya Chemaly, 05/10/12Feminist, Satirist and Media CriticRape, invisible and ubiquitous, is perceived as sexual and inevitable, and we tend to think of children and women as collaterally damaged during war.

Our crisis has nothing to do with private morality. It\u0027s a crisis of public morality.Read Post | Comments (472)Randi Weingarten, 05/10/12President, American Federation of TeachersTeacher Appreciation Week soon will be over.

Today, I\u0027m hearing that the only thing that will drive us away from him is the issue of marriage for gays and lesbians. Both assumptions are offensive.Read Post | Comments (171)Carol Hartsell, 05/10/12Comedy Editor, The Huffington PostAt the risk of seeming insensitive as we approach Mother\u0027s Day, I have a bone to pick with everyone out there who has chosen -- or tacitly accepted -- the role of motherhood.

If you watch the below five titles, you\u0027ll know it. But to put it into words, French film to me is: aesthetics, subtleties, sensuality.
