{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Global Editorial DirectorDemocrats like to brag that they have been in continuous operation for two centuries, longer than any other major political party in the free world. It certainly feels like it. With the possible (perhaps even likely) entry of Vice President Joe Biden, 72, the contest will become an old-fashioned tale of palace intrigue, as he and Hillary Rodham Clinton maneuver for the favor and endorsement of the president. And a three-way race with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) would feature the three sub-brands that have dominated and defined the Democratic Party on campus and in the country since the 1960s.Biden\u0027s sociological logic, which if followed would have improved the outcomes in Iraq and Afghanistan, has major implications for Syria and Libya, as well. Hopefully, the media will offer Biden\u0027s policy suggestions at least as much attention and airtime as his personality quirks.Professor of international relations, George Washington UniversityHe kept mumbling the same thing over and over again. I leaned in further to hear him more clearly, \"forever and ever, forever and ever, forever and ever...\"Campaigns and Communications Manager for LGBT Progress, Center for American ProgressJorge Ramos, who became and American citizen in 2008, takes his role as a journalist seriously. He left his job as a reporter in Mexico because he didn\u0027t want to be told what to say. He has succeeded beyond his dreams in reporting on the issues and concerns of his audience.Hofstra Journalism ProfessorWhat William F. Buckley and Gore Vidal did for discourse in America was unprecedented. They proved there was a time not so long ago we relished hearing both sides of political arguments. And there is a time -- call it the present -- when a hunger for authenticity seems to be driving both parties in unexpected directions.CEO, Professional Investor and Chairman, Intelligence Squared U.S. DebatesMost professors in this situation would have patted themselves on the back for having managed to get the article back online and then turned their attention back to their usual work of teaching and scholarship. But Dreger has made a career out of defending academic freedom.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoIn the first half of this year, at least six domestic coal companies filed for bankruptcy. In February, West Virginia\u0027s Covington Coal fell, followed by Xinergy and Grass Creek Coal in April, Patriot and Birmingham Coal \u0026 Coke in May, and A\u0026M Coal in June. But in August came the biggest news of all.Author, \u0027A Dream Foreclosed\u0027On Women\u0027s Equality Day, we write to echo the hundreds of thousands of grassroots activists who support the Women On 20s campaign. As we continue making progress for the cause of women\u0027s rights, we hope to preserve Alexander Hamilton\u0027s place on our currency while elevating a woman to a place she deserves.U.S. Representative for New Jersey\u0027s 9th congressional districtDelegate to the U.S. House of Representatives from the U.S. Virgin Island’s at-large congressional district, attorneyComedian and creator of TheCooperReview.comJeremy Corbyn is having that impact because, as with Bernie Sanders, his radicalism is galvanizing a new generation of potential voters. These are potential voters who are tired of \"politics as usual.\" But for them, the tiredness rests not in the stupidity or incompetence of those who govern us, but because for far too long, those politics have been too right-wing, and too lacking in both progressive impulses and equalitarian outcomes.Worrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsWho knew a New Age crafts seller could be so, well, crafty? Etsy joins a larger fraternity of American corporations that use a variety of offshore tax havens to collectively dodge $90 billion in U.S. taxes every year. But few if any of those other companies make such bold ethical claims as Etsy.Executive Director, Americans for Tax FairnessIndia has extraordinary potential. Modi recently acknowledged that \"there are huge global expectations for India.\" But for decades the Indian government has squandered its future.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteWhat should be immediately treated as a welfare issue and medical crisis for an individual experiencing a psychotic episode often becomes criminal threats and illegal behavior, punishable by imprisonment. This is inhumane. This is profiting off of human suffering. This must stop.Vice President, Impact JusticeMy name is Laurent Duquesne and I was a passenger on the Thalys train that came under attack en route from Amsterdam to Paris. I was in car number 11, seat number 41, the same car that Jean-Hugues Anglade and his family were in, and I saw things from the inside following the unfolding of events.Engineer, passenger on Thalys train from Amsterdam to ParisThis is my foster dog, Elly, from Fulton County Animal Services. She\u0027s an 8-year old pit bull mix who\u0027s looking for her forever home. One day Elly will leave us and teach another family all of these lessons. But as I sit here in front of my laptop, while Elly is snoring next to me, I am so grateful.Women\u0027s volleyball coach, marketing professional, mother to two rescue dogs, craft beer enthusiast, avid pit bull advocateAn unprecedented group of Iranian human rights defenders and pro-democracy activists have come out in a massive wave in support of Iran nuclear agreement.President, National Iranian American CouncilOne year into the cease-fire agreement that ended last summer\u0027s 50-day war in the Gaza Strip, Israel and Hamas appear to be advancing toward a series of understandings -- an agreement, even -- that would practically end the siege on the Gaza Strip and bring long-term quiet to the area. The agreement talks are being mediated by former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who three months ago stepped down as the longtime envoy of the international Quartet.Postdoctoral Research Fellow, Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International AffairsToday marks Women\u0027s Equality Day in the United States. It\u0027s humbling to think about the sacrifices made by countless women (and men) to get us to where we are today. But, we still have a long way to go until we reach equal pay, equal opportunity and safe and respectful environments for women.Chief Human Resources Officer, AccenturePeter Gelb: Take note! Though the Met audiences expect their (significant) money\u0027s worth, with all the union troubles this year, bringing productions like this one for a \"newcomers\" series at the Met with reduced prices could be an answer to building new audiences. Just sayin\u0027.Culture Columnist, Huffington Post, CultureZohnPoverty numbers have steadily risen for during the decade after Katrina. There\u0027s been no sign of a turnaround. For that to happen, there would have to be a massive commitment of funds to job training and education programs and greater tax incentives for businesses to hire the poor.Author and political analystWith the right to bear arms no matter the consequences firmly established in U.S. law and the psyche of our citizens, the NRA has to push new laws to stay viable and keep Congress and state legislatures firmly in its political pocket. One of the newer so-called gun rights the group has cooked up is campus carry.Money Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsOne of the lessons of Katrina is that private companies have an important role to play in filling the gaps between the public sector and NGOs when it comes to disaster relief, and no company is too small to be a part of the solution..Founder and CEO, CausecastTen years after Katrina, the tension between reforming the city into something better still clashes with the powerful and innate human desire to return to the familiar, to reclaim what was lost, especially after the trauma of the worst disaster in U.S. history.Chief District Defender, Orleans ParishIt\u0027s not about \"political correctness\" (in the context of current Mississippi politics, supporting the inclusion of the Rebel standard on the state flag is the politically \"correct\" thing to do). It\u0027s about moral correctness; it\u0027s about historical correctness; it\u0027s about common decency.HistorianIn the eight years it took us to get this movie to the screen, our dad has visited Drew and me on four movie sets on three continents. Drew and I live about a mile apart from each other, work together, and spend probably half our waking hours talking.Director and writer of \u0027No Escape\u0027Your employees are hypersensitive to your behavior, and to that of every leader in the organization. They will keenly notice what you spend time on (and what you don\u0027t), what you ask (and what you don\u0027t), who you talk to (and who you don\u0027t).Founder and Chairman, Conscious Business Center InternationalThe Missouri House hearing was a disaster. No agenda was given to us committee members except for a jumble of abortion statute links. The hearing began with the joint chairs asking what we all wanted to address. It was then that I wanted to stand up and scream.Missouri State RepresentativeI have dealt with every breed and every temperament out there and I can assure you harboring breed discrimination will get you bitten. We treat humans as individuals so shouldn\u0027t we treat animals as individuals, too?Author, writer, artist and former animal control officer, humane law investigator and shelter animal care managerTrump is not a political clown. He is a very talented right wing populist demagogue. And he has brought into full relief many of the radical policies of the entire GOP field -- especially when it comes to immigration.Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersRoutine shackling takes away every scintilla of control a young person has over his or her body. It is completely out of step with the research on what works in juvenile rehabilitation.Staff Attorney at the San Francisco-based Youth Law CenterHaving worked with chaplains from other colleges around the country, I can assure you that they are some of the most compassionate, well-traveled, non-judgmental and quirkily intellectual people you are likely to meet on campus.Executive Editor Of Global Spirituality and Religion, The Huffington PostGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
