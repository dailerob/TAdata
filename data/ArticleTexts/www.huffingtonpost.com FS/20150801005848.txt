{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersThere\u0027s a new kind of language being used around the Iran nuclear deal recently negotiated in Vienna. We can call it \"Trump Talk,\" defined as a drumbeat of outrageous political speech that is historically inaccurate, intellectually dishonest and even deceptive, morally and spiritually offensive and willfully tone deaf. It certainly isn\u0027t serious talk. Many of the same voices urging Congress to kill the agreement belong to those who promised us that regime change in Iraq would unleash a wave of democracy across the region. They insisted that war was the only answer to Saddam Hussein. They were wrong -- deadly wrong -- about Iraq, yet they seem to have neither learned their lesson nor questioned their own instincts and impulses.Sen. Rand Paul has made safeguarding civil liberties a cornerstone of his presidential campaign, and he hasn\u0027t been afraid to take on his own party in that fight. But when it comes to the question of abortion, Rand Paul believes government should be making our most intimate decisions for us.Executive Director of the American Civil Liberties UnionWhen we use atrocity to inspire us to act, to ask the right questions, to reach across the globe and try to stop someone from being killed or suffering, our world will become a more livable one. Only then will we be able to hope to turn back the tide on genocide.Archbishop Emeritus of Cape TownArchbishop Emeritus of Cape TownA good prediction about how I would feel if I suddenly gained access to the technologies of Star Trek translates into a bad prediction about how they will affect society as a whole. Overlooking hedonic normalization leads us to exaggerate the joyfulness of the future and to overstate the joylessness of the past.Author, The Sceptical Optimist: Why Technology Isn\u0027t the Answer to EverythingSouth African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, one of the world\u0027s leading peace and justice advocates, has called Bryan Stevenson \"America\u0027s Nelson Mandela.\" He has gotten innocent men off death row, successfully argued before the U.S. Supreme Court multiple times, including to ban \"death sentences.\"President, Children\u0027s Defense FundDonald Trump is many things -- a demagogue and a pompous blowhard, a braggart and a race baiter--but in the end, he\u0027s nobody\u0027s fool, except perhaps his own. Thus, his recent lauding of Sarah Palin and his hiring of her former Chief of Staff reveal that Trump\u0027s campaign for the presidency is, ultimately, more of a circus act than it is a serious endeavor for the White House.Author and filmmakerOwn your pleasure. You\u0027re not a slut for wanting to come. You\u0027re not greedy for wanting to come as much as possible. You\u0027re a human. Human\u0027s seek pleasure. Soak it in, as much as you can get.Columnist and author of \u0027Open: Love, Sex, and Life in an Open Marriage\u0027 and \u0027O Wow! Discovering Your Ultimate Orgasm\u0027Next week, the Environmental Protection Agency is expected to announce what may be the Obama administration\u0027s most far-reaching climate change initiative: its final rule for cleaning up existing electric power plants. Dubbed the Clean Power Plan, it will require each state to submit its own individual strategy for cutting emissions.Senior Writer, Union of Concerned ScientistsAt a time when apathy reigns and far too many think it\u0027s someone else\u0027s job to figure out what\u0027s happening with our government, our laws, our policies, and our representatives, I think it\u0027s critical that as many people as possible get informed. But my problem? Zealots. Fanatics.Sass \u0026 SensibilityIn order to successfully counter ISIS online recruitment, both the message and messenger should be of Sunni origin. It is the grassroots Sunni religious leadership not Western powers that can effectively articulate the threat that ISIS poses not only to people of the Middle East but also to Islam itself.Associate Professor of public diplomacy and public relations at the Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse UniversityIt\u0027s tough to represent the hopes of Americans hurt by entrenched political interests when you\u0027ve taken money from Donald Trump, or you\u0027ve already run a campaign ad in 2008 that utilizes a \"racist sub-message.\" For these reasons, Clinton\u0027s problem with white liberals, and Sanders\u0027s eventual appeal to minority voters, will enable Vermont\u0027s Senator to win the Democratic nomination.Columnist and author published in The Hill, The Baltimore Sun, The Jerusalem Post, Salon, and other publicationsYour advice doesn\u0027t feel like help. It feels like control. You don\u0027t want our happiness. You want our obedience. You don\u0027t want us to be better parents. You want us to be complacent children. But guess what? We\u0027re going to do things and decide things that look CRAZY to you.Coach, writer, speakerOnly until recently did I realize that information about one\u0027s physical makeup is part of a science called phenotyping, and that such insight can be used to determine the types of exercise that will work with your body, not against it.Associate Third Metric Editor, The Huffington PostRepublicans cheered the Citizens United ruling in 2010. Now they have it to thank for the spectacle of Ted Cruz calling Mitch McConnell a liar on the floor of the Senate and Donald Trump leading in the polls.Author/Professor, Miami University, Oxford, OhioEvery action has two purposes: You act in order to move toward a desired result, and you act in order to express your values.Founder and Chairman, Conscious Business Center InternationalFearing for your life every time you walk outside, every time you get behind the wheel, every time you see a police officer, every time you breathe, is exhausting. Living in a world in which your blackness and woman-ness makes you less than human -- a hypersexual, angry or subservient caricature, the constant target of catcalling, rape and assault -- is exhausting.Black feminist writer and PhD candidateNext week on the date of the anniversary of the signing of the Act, Republican presidential primary contenders will be holding their first TV debate. Think about this for a moment: On the 50th Anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, the Republican party today, along with Chief Justice Roberts\u0027 2014 Shelby v Holder decision, has done more to dismantle the Act, than any other effort in recent memory.Diversity Visiting Professor, University of San Francisco; and Scholar Writer in Residence, MLK, Jr. Institute, Stanford UniversityThe U.S. military is now helping Turkey\u0027s hardliners achieve their goals against the very Kurdish fighters whose close coordination with U.S. bombers have pushed ISIS back from Kobane and disrupted its supply lines.Publisher and editor-in-chief, The GlobalistIt\u0027s Possible to Care About Cecil the Lion and Other Issues at the Same Time; Bob\u0027s Latest Twitter Battle with Dan Bidondi; The Bionic Dan Bidondi Bionic Italian Airlines; and much more.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027There\u0027s just something about grilling and summer that makes us want to be better grillers.

I didn\u0027t know very much about Special Olympics except that it provided sport programs to people with intellectual disabilities. I reluctantly accepted the invitation. I could have never imagined how this single act would change my life forever.Olympic Champion, member of the Special Olympics Canada BoardAccording to the National Alliance on Mental Illness website, more than half of all jail and prison inmates have a recent history or symptoms of a mental health problem. An estimated 31 percent of women and 14.5 percent of men in jails have a serious mental illness.Former detective and police chief, Law Enforcement Against Prohibition speakerIt is best to allow your children to be fully responsible for any student loans they incur. Sometimes, students can get more financial aid (in the form of loans) if their parents put their names on the line for the loans. However, you should avoid this if possible.Author Soldier of Finance, Founder GoodFinancialCents.comEven for those who support the KXL pipeline, would anybody be willing to stand behind a high-risk, badly built one? Let alone one designed to shuttle dirty tar sands crude to Gulf Coast refineries and export terminals, which would raise gas prices at home.Executive Director, DeSmogBlog.comTrump\u0027s shoot-from-the-hip style is appealing to many at the moment, but outspokenness can quickly devolve into tantrum, which will eventually become a problem on the way to the Oval Office.CEO, Dezenhall ResourcesAdequate amounts of sleep are essential for optimal health. Sleep is inexpensive, does not require a visit to the doctor and has no side effects. If, as individuals and a society, we place more value on obtaining sufficient sleep, we will eventually be healthier, happier and more productive.Gerald E. McGinnis Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School; Editor of the Sleep and Health Education Program at Harvard Medical School’s Division of Sleep MedicineInstead of protecting space for independent civil society organizations to operate freely, the Egyptian government has stepped up its harassment and disruption of the legitimate activities of human rights organizations.International Policy Adviser for Human Rights FirstWhile it is easy to be caught off-guard when a child uses inappropriate language online, it is important for the parent to not overreact or belittle the child because the parent\u0027s response to the child\u0027s probably experimental rebellion may have a lasting impact on her. A warm and positive relationship with the child will induce her to seek the parent out for information and advice about words and behavior.Co-founder \u0026 CEO, Mobicip.comMost people love eating, quite a few enjoy cooking, but almost nobody gets their kicks from washing a tower of dirty dishes.
