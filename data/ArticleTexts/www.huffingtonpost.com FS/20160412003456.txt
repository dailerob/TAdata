{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Every once in a while, I have an experience that sheds some light on why most of the one percent do not give a rip about the struggles of regular people, and why so many voters are turning to outsiders like Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump. Wealth has always had its privileges, of course, but lately the gap has widened. Daily life is more and more of a hassle for more and more people, whether it involves insecurity of jobs, of pay, of schools, of health care, of retirement, of unaffordable apartments and tuitions, of long lines and crumbling transit systems -- you name it. And the super-elite doesn\u0027t care, because they literally don\u0027t experience any of this. Thus the Sanders and Trump revolutions.A question: If the takers aren\u0027t standing in the unemployment line or rushing home from the second job to change diapers, just where are they? Because an awful lot of America\u0027s resources have gone missing. Like money that should be going to education, job training, healing the sick, retirement funds, infrastructure and, you know -- life.Author and cultural theoristCruz kept his powder dry in the earlier primaries and caucuses, refusing to get caught up in the name calling and sniping that characterized much of the campaign. He was an outstanding college debater, but so far his debate performances during the primaries has been unremarkable. Instead, he has focused on winning delegates with charm, wit and deceit.Hofstra Journalism ProfessorThe testing regime is destroying education.It is driven by politicians who think that tests make students smarter and by educrats who fear to think an independent thought.Research Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027The data doesn\u0027t lie. Silicon Valley and the tech industry have a diversity/inclusion problem. When it comes to access to capital, most investment firms and teams, and the companies that receive investment, are led by Whites.Founder and president, Rainbow/PUSH CoalitionI think he knew better than to subject himself to his peers during those unattended morning hours. The schoolyard could be a dangerous place for all of us, especially if you were different.Public health academic and advocateRather than focusing on the \"world drug problem\" as prohibitionists are want to do, we should instead be addressing the \"problematic way we deal with drugs.\" Formulated this way, it is then possible to have a genuinely \"people-centered\" approach to drug policy that actually improves lives rather than destroys them.Former President of Brazil; Member of the Berggruen Institute’s 21st Century CouncilTo address the Syrian refugee crisis, the roll out of double-shift schools has rapidly become part of the education landscape. The target is now set for 1 million children to go back in the next school year, and there is no reason why this should not happen.President of Theirworld and executive chair of the Global Business Coalition for EducationOver the past three decades, corporations virtually eliminated secure pensions, forced workers into risky, self-pay plans and handed hundreds of millions in tax-free retirement benefits to the top dogs. Pensions aren\u0027t dead; they\u0027re just exclusive now.International President, United SteelworkersThe generational divide in the Democratic primary is phenomenal. If it weren\u0027t for voters over 49, and their higher participation rates, Hillary Clinton wouldn\u0027t have much of a chance.Co-director, Center for Economic and Policy Research, Washington, D.C.The focus on what a woman earns each year compared to her male counterparts masks a related and equally important issue: the gap in women\u0027s retirement insecurity.Director of Women’s Economic Policy at the Center for American ProgressSenior Fellow, Center for American ProgressThere is much about Donald Trump that deserves to be criticized. On foreign policy, however, his at times unsophisticated formulations reflect far greater common sense than possessed by his political opponents and establishment critics.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteDonald Trump\u0027s idea that Japan and South Korea should be allowed to get nuclear weapons to defend themselves, and lessen the burden on the United States, doesn\u0027t seem so wild-eyed.Senior Fellow and Director of the Center on Peace \u0026 Liberty, The Independent InstituteThe EU claims that Greek authorities have ensured that the Pakistani nationals being returned to Turkey since April 04 do not need protection (as per international law). But Greek officials themselves have publicly declared that they lack capacity to make such determinations.Executive Director, co-founder of Refugee Solidarity Network; AttorneyThe most interesting part of American Crime Story, the TV series chronicling the O.J. Simpson trial, was the way it revealed how mid-90s views on race and gender shaped the outcome of this case. Throughout the trial, lead prosecutor Marcia Clark was a target for sexism. In 2016, female lawyers still deal with a lot of the same prejudice.Blogs Editor, Huffington PostThe recent kerfluffle about Bernie Sanders purportedly not knowing how to bust up the big banks says far more about the threat Sanders poses to the Democratic establishment and its Wall Street wing than it does about the candidate himself.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027Too many of the top .1 of the one percent, who already have every advantage over everyone else in the world, have become so greedy and so utterly amoral that they are fundamentally eroding our society\u0027s democracy, government and sense of morality.Co-Founder, Democracy PartnersHillary\u0027s comment holds more significance than simply referring to gang members. Referring to black kids as super-predators back then is like how people use \"thug\" now. It was used to justify mass incarceration for many addicts and small dose marijuana users, not dealers.Attorney-Writer-EntrepreneurThe debate over how India is to appear in California textbooks has to be seen against the backdrop, not only of Indian political action committees, of what is emerging as a pattern of influence exerted by Hindu nationalist groups here in the U.S. upon U.S. education.Louise Hewlett Nixon Professor, Stanford UniversityWhen they aren\u0027t being erroneously denounced as terrorists, Syrian refugees have a similarly unjustified reputation as fundamentalists who oppose liberty.Director of Immigration Policy, Niskanen CenterNorth Carolina wasted taxpayer dollars and time, passing a law to \"prevent\" a potential crime that has never happened. Yet there are children (and adults) being viciously attacked, harassed, stalked, bullied and more every day on the internet.Sassy, outspoken, \u0026 passionate about equal rights. Blogger at The Color Coded Life.It is time for journalism to reclaim at least some degree of respectability by focusing on facts, and the most salient fact facing our political system this summer is that open conventions do not spell disaster. It is important for everyone to relax and for the media to perform its job, which is to report pertinent and inarguable facts.Author, The Evolution of a Revolution, and FrackturedActor; Founder, The Dreyfuss Civics InitiativeIf Republicans really cared about the EEOC\u0027s \"mission not accomplished\" record due to budget starvation, it would increase funding for investigation and prosecution of giant corporations getting fat off our tax dollars -- while women working for them still slave away for 79 cents on the dollar.Money Editor, Ms. magazine; national gender pay equity consultant, Director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsSanders\u0027 critique of Clinton isn\u0027t that she is unqualified or inexperienced. It is far tougher and more substantive. His campaign is premised on the belief that she is too compromised and conservative to be the president we need.President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureThere is an old Italian saying: Latin masks the ignorance of the Priest. So, today: digits mask the ignorance of the Social Scientist. It was said that German philosophers dove deeper than anyone else and came up muddier. Behavioral psychologists make the shallowest of dives and surface beaming with smug self-satisfaction.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghAttacks and arrests have largely gone under the radar of anyone not specifically following Asian or Cambodian politics. This may have changed in the last three days.Founder of TheCommunity.comAccording to much of the mainstream media, Bernie Sanders\u0027 recent interview with the New York Daily News was an unmitigated disaster. But a closer look reveals a crucial point about the presidency that is often overlooked: a candidate\u0027s vision and record matter a lot more than specific policy proposals.34Justice co-founder and bloggerLater, healthier, sleep-friendly school hours are a change whose time has come in Massachusetts. In the past month at least three districts have announced plans to delay the start of the school day to give students a chance for healthier sleep.Executive Director and Co-Founder, Start School Later, Inc.; medical writer and historian, novelist, playwrightThe extremist right-wing network of Fox News and talk radio was not created by politicians, and it is not funded by a political party. It is not supported by donations from people seeking political expression. No. It was created for one central purpose: to make money.Writer and commentator in New York CityMaybe you didn\u0027t quit that stressful job, buy the boat, and sail away into the sunset. But maybe, while your bucket list was shoved unwillingly aside, you ended up doing the very things you were meant to do. The things that shaped who you are and how you affected the other people in your life.Mother, writer, and blogger at bumblebirdblog.comParents in the \u002770s defined their roles in a way we never have. I worry that our kids are leaving home with more intellectual ability than we did, but without the life skills that will give them the success and independence that we\u0027ve enjoyed.Reader, writer, and happy to be here.Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
