These are the right questions to keep the campfires burning (fueled with the promise of new energies that could bring both a cleaner and safer world). Hope is something you decide and not something you feel. And that decision to hope is what always has changed the world.Some believe the central political issue of our era is the size of the government. They\u0027re wrong. The central issue is whom the government is for.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Americans are skilled at that combination of complacency and despair that assumes things cannot change and that we, the people, do not have the power to change them. Yet you have to be abysmally ignorant of history, as well as of current events, not to see that our country and our world have always been changing, are in the midst of great and terrible changes, and are occasionally changed through the power of the popular will and idealistic movements.Author, \u0027Men Explain Things to Me\u0027Something is deeply awry in our nation with the world\u0027s biggest economy that lets its children be the poorest group and the younger they are the poorer they are during their years of greatest brain development. The Prince of Peace is mocked as we let a child be injured or killed by guns every thirty minutes.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundI don\u0027t like -- don\u0027t approve, refuse to throw myself into -- the spirit of obligatory gift-giving.

But we should never walk away from them because of that.Actor, director and environmental activistHere in their refugee camp, the Christians with no Christmas like us in the West have placed a refugee tent for Jesus, and there in the camp is a tent for another person who was also a poor refugee who had nothing.Reverend, Chaplain of St. George’s Anglican Church in BaghdadHad Democrats resolutely opposed the budget deal, it would have revealed Republicans as friends of Wall Street and enemies of Main Street -- a useful party differentiation between now and 2016.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027I pray for unity in the city, as pain runs deep in many communities. But, we will no longer tolerate those, like Pat Lynch, who want to create more pain by attempting to divide the people and those who have taken an oath to protect and serve them.Founder, GlobalGrind.comThis year, my ex asked to have the boys for dinner on the first night. Even though it wasn\u0027t his usual night, he promised to have them home for bedtime. It took a moment to register but I realized that I was no longer a necessary part of this holiday. He is now ready to take on this tradition on his own.Publicist. Blogger at DivorceDoula.me, BLUNTMoms.com \u0026 UrbanMommies.ca. Welcome to The After Wife.The Heathrow plot is among the clearest.

Through the long rectangular windows, I saw the white lights of a Christmas tree sparkling against the glass. And I knew, in my heart, he had found someone else.Chicago-based writer and teacher, working on a memoir.We won\u0027t be able to stop disasters from happening. On the contrary, climate change may increase the frequency and severity of floods, droughts and storms. But we are better equipped today to prepare for them and reduce their impact.Chief Operating Officer and Managing Director, World BankFor me, Christmas is a reading, restful time and I like particularly to read a book that sweeps me into a complete world, somewhere else. It may be a true somewhere else, but it should be far from our own every day. That is precisely what The Queen of Four Kingdoms will do.Writer and creator, \u0027Downton Abbey\u0027I\u0027ve noticed that most people listening to \"Serial\" don\u0027t know some key facts about the criminal justice system. Here are some of the most common misconceptions I\u0027ve noticed about people\u0027s comprehension of the legal system which ultimately we are all beholden to.Writer, Lawyer, Dancer, BloggerI know you\u0027ll smile and nod politely when you open that new snowboard, remote control car, or electronic device. I\u0027m grateful you\u0027ll be magnanimous. Magnanimous means -- oh forget it, I know you\u0027re barely listening at this point.

While I am not particularly nostalgic, I\u0027d like to review some of the highlights -- and lowlights -- of 2014...President, Touro CollegeWe live in a cash-driven political age. We won\u0027t get the reform we need if we rely on elected officials to enact it for us. That will take an independent movement which isn\u0027t beholden to any party or special interest. Building titwill be a major challenge, and nobody else will do it for us.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourAs we steel ourselves to keep combatting this crisis, it\u0027s important to highlight the public health lessons learned over 2014.

A good start would be to join international conventions that protect human rights.Chairman, Senate Judiciary CommitteeMillions of Americans are still filing for bankruptcy because of medical debt, even though they have insurance.
