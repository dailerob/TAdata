{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Governor Jan Brewer\u0027s veto of a bill that would have allowed discrimination against gays on religious grounds is only the latest example of the tension between the corporate and fundamentalist right. She acted because business elites feared that the measure would be bad for the state\u0027s economy. The alliance between the fundamentalist far right and the business elite was always a bizarre marriage of convenience. The Wall Street gang tends to be relatively liberal on social and lifestyle issues, the very issues where the conservative base detests godless liberals. Many Tea Party Republicans, meanwhile, embody a kind of rightwing economic populism that doesn\u0027t have much use for investment bankers.Comments (79)Bob CescaManaging Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowThe Republican battle against the Affordable Care Act just can\u0027t catch a break. First, the website is repaired and currently runs quite well. Then their Obamacare horror stories turn out to be bogus, and Boehner basically gave up on trying to repeal the law. And now, this.CommentsHoward FinemanEditorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupVladimir Putin has been hiding his intentions in plain sight. In an infamous 2005 speech, he declared that the dissolution of the Soviet Union was the “major geopolitical disaster of the century.”Comments (83)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarThere is an argument that the internet makes us smarter, makes us faster, makes us more connected; it also appears to be making us meaner; especially in the warren of social media.CommentsJohn R. TalbottAuthor, \u0027Survival Investing: How to Prosper Amid Thieving Banks and Corrupt Governments\u0027Let\u0027s get rid of student debt. Let\u0027s replace it with a system where investors fund students\u0027 full tuition in exchange for a piece of the students\u0027 future earnings for some defined time period, say the next ten years.Comments (43)James ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu never tires of inventing new hoops through which he insists Palestinians jump. As he acknowledged a few weeks back, it\u0027s all part of a cynical game that he plays in an effort to kill the chances for peace.Comments (61)Ola OjewumiFounder, Sacred Hearts Children’s Transplant Foundation and Project ASCENDThere are hundreds of little Lupitas across the globe that now believe they can achieve their dreams because of your presence as an astounding role model. This Oscar win is more than just another accolade; it symbolizes a change that women of color have been waiting for.CommentsRajan MenonSpitzer Professor of Political Science, Colin Powell School, City College of New York/City University of New York; Non Resident Senior Fellow, The Atlantic CouncilLet\u0027s put aside the question of whether Putin\u0027s interpretation is accurate. That\u0027s now irrelevant. What matters is that this is how he sees the drama in Ukraine and that this outlook will shape his actions -- now and in the weeks ahead.Comments (73)Anna HosainChief Editor, Illiterat MagazineThe nominated actresses did not receive Oscar nods or the movie role for which they are nominated by wearing designer dresses. They received their accolades because of their talent, their hard work and their tenacity to keep fighting for their space.CommentsMichael BrennerSenior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghPoll numbers are the life blood of politics these days. Anything expressed in digits has a claim to truth that assertions without digits cannot make.CommentsKen ReedSports Policy Director, League of FansThe head football coach at LSU recently picked up a commitment from quarterback Zadock Dinkelmann. Zack\u0027s an 8th grader from Texas. That\u0027s not a misprint; Dinkelmann is indeed an 8th grader. Recruiting middle school kids is increasingly common at the highest levels of college sports.CommentsKari Kubiszyn KampakisColumnist, blogger at karikampakis.comWhat we may justify as \"good parenting\" can hurt our children later. Unless we\u0027re mindful of that, it\u0027s easy to handicap them by making their lives too easy.CommentsIan Haney LópezUC Berkeley law professor; Senior Fellow, Demos; Author of \u0027Dog Whistle Politics: How Coded Racial Appeals Have Reinvented Racism and Wrecked the Middle Class\u0027In a political milieu fraught with strategic racial innuendo, \"Obamacare\" is racially potent. It picks up the other slanders piled around the president and it piles these onto the Southern Strategy slam that liberalism panders to undeserving minorities.CommentsBill McGowanFounder, Clarity Media GroupFor those of us who displayed the ultimate stamina last night and braved three-and-a-half hours of glitzy ho-hum, here is a recap of those who distinguished themselves at the microphone while holding their Oscar.CommentsLeo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersAll those rights Americans cherish, those fundamental human and political freedoms protected by the U.S. Constitution, Republicans contend those aren\u0027t really inalienable rights or anything solid or permanent like that.Comments (53)David Sack, M.D.Because when it comes to addiction, every day presents new challenges, and having a plan \"just in case\" offers a second chance to those struggling with drug abuse and peace of mind for the people who love them.CommentsJohn Kerry, Eric H. Holder, Jr. and Sally JewellYou can do your part too. Do not buy suspicious goods. Do not buy ivory -- even small trinkets or jewelry. Turn down the offer to buy that tiger skin rug. Reject the shark fin soup. We can make a difference for ourselves, and for generations to come.CommentsEarl Ofari HutchinsonAuthor and political analystGOP leaders took giddy delight in mocking President Obama\u0027s 90-minute phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.Comments (76)Lindsay HolmesAssociate Editor, GPS for the Soul, The Huffington PostNobody wants to slip on ice in a skirt and tights, but the point is you stand back up and take the next wobbly steps toward the subway. The same thing goes for anything in life, whether it\u0027s in your personal relationships or at work. You aren\u0027t going to sit firmly planted in the snow -- you\u0027re going to keep going.CommentsRev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkThe road to equality and justice is paved with the tireless work of countless individuals that opened doors so that others could kick them down later.CommentsJim Yong KimPresident, World Bank GroupEliminating discrimination is not only the right thing to do; it\u0027s also critical to ensure that we have sustained, balanced and inclusive economic growth in all societies -- whether in developed or developing nations, the North or the South, America or Africa.CommentsNorman SolomonAuthor, \u0027War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death\u0027International law is suddenly very popular in Washington. President Obama responded to Russian military intervention in the Crimea by accusing Russia of a \"breach of international law.\" Unfortunately, during the last five years, no world leader has done more to undermine international law than Barack Obama.Comments (13)David MacarayPlaywright and author (\"It\u0027s Never Been Easy: Essays on Modern Labor\")Normally, I have little patience with people who criticize the Academy Awards. It\u0027s show biz. It\u0027s hype. It\u0027s glitz layered with more glitz. Don\u0027t take it so seriously. But this year\u0027s Oscars put me in such a rotten mood, I was forced to bring out the long knives.Comments (34)David L. PhillipsDirector of the Program on Peace-building and Rights, Columbia University’s Institute for the Study of Human RightsPutin is in complete control of the situation. He delights in making a mockery of Obama\u0027s righteous indignation, exposing the hypocrisy and weakness of the West. After Obama\u0027s wobbly warning to Syria, Putin knows that Obama will never go to war over Ukraine.CommentsRev. Dr. Susan Brooks ThistlethwaiteProfessor of Theology, Chicago Theological SeminaryWhat do you get when you combine ultra-nationalist religious and political conservatism along with homophobia and sexism? That is the toxic mix that is fueling Vladimir Putin\u0027s militaristic moves against the people of Ukraine.Comments (14)Mike WeisserMike the Gun GuyThe only problem is that if Rand Paul really believes that guns aren\u0027t a public health issue, he\u0027s woefully ignorant of the determinations made by his own medical profession whose uncontested views and guidelines on gun violence have been on public record for more than 30 years.Comments (116)Whitney RichelleAmerican journalist living in Florence, ItalyYou won\u0027t find them in Italian books, but you\u0027ll hear them all over the streets. Understanding them will give you a huge boost in comprehension. Using them will make you much more fun to talk to.CommentsJacqueline HerreraCo-founder, KitechildBeyond liking a page, photo, or post, the real power of social media lies with personal thoughts and stories that will inspire followers to go further than a retweet and invest in causes through donating or volunteering.CommentsRick NoackFreelance journalist in France and GermanyFirstly, and most importantly, the Crimean conflict is not about ideologies but rather about military strategy and economic influence. Secondly -- and more broadly -- the emergence of a new Cold War is nearly impossible in a globalized world.CommentsRichard KirschSenior Fellow, Roosevelt Institute; author of \u0027Fighting for Our Health\u0027The question of how to deal with our employer-based health system continues to provide fodder for attacks on Obamacare. But in terms of policy, there is a simple solution.CommentsTré EastonWriter. Politico. Aspiring good member of society.If I hear one more member of the Millennial generation tell me how \"not political\" they are, or how disinterested they are in the current affairs of this country, I cannot be held responsible for my reaction.CommentsBernard Starr, 2014. 3.03Mary Anne Franks, 2014. 3.03H.
