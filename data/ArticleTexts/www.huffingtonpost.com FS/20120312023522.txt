{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"What does it look like when something catches fire? And what does it look like when it doesn\u0027t? This week we had a stark example of both. There was the incredible virality of the Kony 2012 video, which has become the fastest growing social media campaign of all time, having garnered over 67 million YouTube views in less than a week. Clearly the film has struck a nerve. The same can\u0027t be said of Mitt Romney\u0027s campaign, which is still struggling to go viral with the GOP base. Following a less than decisive Super Tuesday performance, Romney continued his Awkward Tour of America. After failing to ingratiate himself to Tennessee voters by reciting the lyrics to \"The Ballad of Davy Crockett\" on Monday, he ended the week in Mississippi, where he declared, \"I like grits.\" Thud. Maybe he should hire the team at Invisible Children to make his next round of campaign ads.Read Post | Comments (91)Mohamed A.

Our media culture is locked in the Perpetual Now, constantly chasing ephemeral scoops that last only seconds and that most often don\u0027t matter in the first place, even for the brief moment that they\u0027re \"exclusive.\"Read Post | Comments (260)David Cameron, 03/07/12Prime Minister of Great BritainViolence against women is an iceberg under the surface of society.

And now, more than ever before, countless people are asking how to help the victims and not only how to help catch Kony.Read Post | Comments (82)Bill McKibben, 03/08/12Author of a dozen books, including \u0027The End of Nature\u0027 and \u0027Deep Economy\u0027A year ago almost no one had heard of the pipeline. Even four months ago, a poll of 300 \"energy insiders\" still found 97 percent predicting it would get its permit. But it didn\u0027t -- TransCanada can of course re-apply, but that will be another battle, down the road.Read Post | Comments (362)Traci Lords, 03/09/12Actress, singer, songwriterIt looks like some of the critics aren\u0027t being much kinder to Disney\u0027s $250 million version of Princess of Mars than they were to the 99 cent adaptation I acted in previously.Read Post | Comments (244)Kenny Loggins, 03/08/12Singer/SongwriterBobby, my old friend and trusted adviser on all-things-career-oriented, told me: \"The hard truth is, you\u0027re just too old to start over.\" His \"advice\" was not easy to ignore, and I could feel the \"sensible,\" scared part of me take his words way too far to heart.Read Post | Comments (55)Diana Nyad, 03/07/12Long Distance Swimmer, Journalist, BroadcasterThis summer, I will make the swim from Cuba to Florida, where I will finally crawl up on that shore.Read Post | Comments (38)Patrick Morrison, 03/09/12Slavic Studies student, Wayne State UniversityOne of the questions I get most about my Jeopardy experience is, \"What\u0027s Alex Trebek like, and why doesn\u0027t he have a mustache anymore?\" I confess that I struggle to answer both questions with any degree of certainty.Read Post | Comments (61)Connie Britton, 03/08/12ActressToday, March 8, is International Women\u0027s Day, a day to focus on women\u0027s social and economic progress.
