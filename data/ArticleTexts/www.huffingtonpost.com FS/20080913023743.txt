{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOSince the day he tossed his hat into the ring Obama has been hit up with vicious innuendo and outright lies regarding his heritage, his patriotism, and his religion. And in almost every circumstance his denials have been tepid when not simply nonexistent. Contrast that with the entire Republican machine (aided and abetted by the media) getting \"outraged\" by the \"lipstick on a pig\" line. With pushback like he\u0027s given recently, Obama oughta be looking to play cribbage this November with the guys at the assisted living home for Democrats. Maybe. Except that Obama had himself a siddown with Bill Clinton.Read Post | CommentsBIONathan Gardels, 09.12.2008The Beijing Olympics marked the advent of a new era in which China would emerge out of the mists of history -- not as a hegemonic superpower, but as the superior civilization in a post-American world.Read Post | Comments (29)BIOLincoln Mitchell, 09.12.2008Palin\u0027s presence has moved the numbers, but not all that much, and perhaps not for all that long.

Not because she\u0027s met Putin or Gorbachev or demonstrates knowledge. But because you can see Russia from Alaska.Read Post | Comments (46)BIOMichael Shaw, 09.12.2008I don\u0027t see how John McCain can call his stealth appearance at the Shanksville memorial ceremony early yesterday anything but a campaign appearance.Read Post | Comments (12)BIOBill Squadron, 09.12.2008Having discovered that to today\u0027s worried Americans the mantra of \"experience\" loses to the appeal of \"change,\" McCain is trying to use his obsolete maverick laurels to recast himself as the \"change\" candidate.Read Post | CommentsBIOLionel Beehner, 09.12.2008Her grasp of world affairs is so bad, so shallow, so slippery, every foreign service officer deployed overseas should be shaking in their boots.Read Post | Comments (95)Rep.
