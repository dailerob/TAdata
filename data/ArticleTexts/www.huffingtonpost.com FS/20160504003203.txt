{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027This is not an esoteric conversation for economists and policy wonks. This is the bread and butter that workers will see on the table over the next several years. It is a bit bizarre that the Fed is openly debating whether it should raise interest rates to slow the pace of job creation and dampen wage growth even as candidates are running around the country promising to do the opposite. It seems reasonable to expect that candidates for president would tell the public about their attitude toward the Fed and in particular what sort of person they would appoint to be governors. There are already two vacant positions on the seven-member board of governors. In addition, Janet Yellen will come up for reappointment in the first year of the next president’s term. Pretending the Fed does not exist is not serious economic policy.The Chief Justice has led the Court\u0027s conservative majority in a counterrevolution against the fruits of the civil rights movement. This is not a matter of happenstance, but a defining feature of his legal career.Novelist and contributing opinion writerHaberman is a seasoned, smart journalist with a stellar reputation, and that makes her story -- and her \"he\u0027s complicated\" rationale for writing it -- all the more baffling.Queer Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostI love Instagram. It\u0027s a platform that\u0027s kind of fun to use, and I definitely enjoy it. But it\u0027s also pretty fucked.Entrepreneur, writer, critical and digital evangelist.What does it say about our society that Scott Cross needed extraordinary courage to speak at the sentencing hearing of his high school wrestling coach, Dennis Hastert? Do we want to live in a world in which crime victims do not feel comfortable sharing their stories?Smile Collector. Daily Swimmer. Creator of decision explorer, Our Choices for Healing In Justice.America will elect its next president this year, and our Moms Demand Action volunteers have been pressing all the candidates about where they stand on gun safety. It\u0027s more important than ever to show that we are a force, that we are changing how gun safety is viewed as a political issue.Founder, Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in AmericaBernie\u0027s voters aren\u0027t just voting for Bernie. We are voting for the causes he supports and the solutions he aspires to. Bernie\u0027s path to the nomination is all but closed now, but the path to strengthening his message is still wide open.Democratic candidate for U.S. Representative of North Carolina\u0027s 2nd Congressional DistrictWhile Amy Schumer is able to make light of the struggle that many of us go through each month when trying to access birth control, in actuality, it’s anything but funny. Trust me, I’m not laughing.Policy Counsel, Reproductive Health, Rights \u0026 JusticeWebster\u0027s Dictionary defines decoupling as \"eliminating the interrelationship\" between two processes. But the interrelationship between CO2 emissions and economic growth has certainly not been eliminated.Director of the Harvard Environmental Economics ProgramBlack America has long had its own lexicon of coded language and symbols. But people of color that succeed in corporate or political life tend to pick up and drop the mannerisms, symbols or words that they have grown up with.Independent source of news and analysis, from the academic and research community.We will not leave patients behind. And we will not be silent. Seeking or providing health care must not be a death sentence. You will be judged not on your words today, but on your actions. Your work has only begun. Make this resolution save lives.International President of Médecins Sans FrontièresToday, I\u0027m offering up my own clip show as a retrospective for how we all got to where we stand today: on the brink of Donald Trump essentially wrapping up the Republican nomination for the highest office in the land.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comA well-traveled friend once shared a bit of advice. When visiting one of the great cities of Europe, go to the top hotel in town for a drink. Whether it\u0027s a cosseted bar or lobby lounge, you\u0027re assured of the ultimate in European style.Executive Director, American Jobs AllianceWe write to you as Syrians working on programs meant to support democratic reform. Recent events however have raised doubts whether our work has any meaning.Syrians working for international organizations calling for an end to the Assad regime and Russian aggressionYes, I have a #womancard. Every woman does. This Mother\u0027s Day I decided I will take out my #womancard and play it by lifting up the peacemaking history of Mother\u0027s Day and by challenging the kind of violent, oppressive patriarchal power that leads to social conflict and ultimately to war.Professor of Theology, Chicago Theological SeminaryIt is not just American journalists like Jason Rezaian who are targeted. And in too many cases, countries that the United States considers allies are the ones whose oppressive policies stifle the freedom of the press.Defending Human Rights WorldwideAppalachia has long been in America\u0027s sacrifice zone, metaphorically and literally. Big Coal has plundered thousands of seams, ripped the tops off 500 mountains, extracted the land\u0027s wealth, poisoned its streams and rivers, and left the people destitute. But Appalachia is hardly America\u0027s only sacrifice zone.Former NASA researcher; Emeritus Professor of Mathematics, James Madison UniversityAs parents and as policymakers, we cannot afford to let poverty determine the future of another generation of children. It is critical for policy to address this problem, and the Young Child Tax Credit is an important step in the right direction.U.S. Representative, Connecticut\u0027s Third DistrictPresident, Center for American ProgressSanders hangs his claim on defining \"contested convention\" in a way it never has been before and ignoring the way voting takes place at the convention.University of Maine political scientist who focuses on the history and uses of public opinion in the United StatesThe Israeli-Palestinian conflict has rarely been so far from finding a resolution. Since the cessation of hostilities between Israel and Hamas during the summer of 2014, the desire to seek peace has been diminishing.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUWhen the challenge was put forth by my employer to sit down with my folks and interview them as part of our Talk to Me series, I was both excited and a bit anxious about the opportunity. As a family, we rarely have those sorts of \"big\" talks. In fact, we tend to actively avoid them.Senior Reporter, The Huffington PostFor the second year, Knight Foundation issued a call for innovative ideas that build a sense of community. And for the second time, Americans responded with ingenuity based on deep connection to place and to each other.President of the John S. and James L. Knight FoundationIt’s nice to see international competition for a good cause: a veritable Olympics of carbon cuts. But it’s not enough.Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogSince our wedding, quite a few people have made comments to us that they \"feel bad\" that it rained on our wedding day, or how \"great\" we were for handling it \"despite the rain.\" Let me make one thing clear: September 12, 2015 was the single most perfect, fun, and love-filled day of my life, and I would not change one thing about it, especially not the rain.Student, Touro Law CenterLike many other foreign aid workers and locals I meet, what he really wanted was an American take on the man presently dominating U.S. politics, an explanation of the larger-than-life and stranger-than-life figure who, even in South Sudan, has the ability to suck the air out of any room.Managing Editor, TomDispatch.comAt this stage in the 2016 race for President, Hillary Clinton is not just in a better position than Donald Trump according to polling data, but also because her primary battle is over, and his isn\u0027t.Democratic strategist, campaign consultant and political analyst based in Los Angeles, California.

So why isn\u0027t there more media credit directed his way?Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaThere are two problems with threatening long sentences to extract cooperation from low-level drug offenders.

Their party is going to extreme lengths to suppress the vote of traditional Democratic constituencies like the young and minorities.
