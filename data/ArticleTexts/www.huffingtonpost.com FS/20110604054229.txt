{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureFriday\u0027s dismal jobs numbers only punctuate the reality of an economy that isn\u0027t producing sufficient jobs. The crisis is both immediate and long-term. The so-called recovery hasn\u0027t begun to recover the jobs lost in the Great Recession. 25 million people are in need of full time work. Home values continue to fall. Much of a generation is at risk. This is a classic \"small d\" democratic moment. Washington is oblivious, compromised by moneyed interests, knotted by ideological divides. It will take an angry and aroused citizenry to demand the debate worthy of a great nation in deep trouble.Read Post | CommentsJared Bernstein, 06.03.2011Senior Fellow, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesWe can smooth out the month-by-month data all we want, but the fact is that job growth in the United States is just too slow to provide working families with the job and income opportunities they need.Read Post | CommentsAmb. Marc Ginsberg, 06.03.2011Former U.S. Ambassador to MoroccoDespite economic isolation and growing international outcry, Bashar al-Assad knows he\u0027s safe -- by our statements, we have signaled to him that he is \"too big to fail.\"Read Post | CommentsDr. Andrew Weil, 06.03.2011Founder and director of the Arizona Center for Integrative MedicineOn June 2, a colorful plate replaced the food pyramid as the official icon representing U.S. Dietary Guidelines, and that\u0027s generally good news. But there are some conceptual chips and cracks in this new dinnerware.  Read Post | CommentsJeff Jarvis, 06.03.2011Author: \u0027Public Parts\u0027, \u0027What Would Google Do?\u0027With the net, we have a counterweight to government and media. So the net is not a subset of lands we now know. It is not a a new land. It is the public sphere. Or it can be. It is up to us to protect it.Read Post | CommentsLaurie Garrett and Larry Kramer, 06.03.2011June 5th marks the 30th anniversary of the recognition that a new disease was killing our species. It would become our era\u0027s Great Plague, killing somewhere between 28-35 million human beings, and infecting about 75 million with HIV.Read Post | CommentsShaun Donovan, 06.03.2011U.S. Secretary for Housing and Urban DevelopmentGreening our homes is one of the keys to the 21st century economy -- and to out-innovating our competitors. And that real change requires leadership, solutions and capital from the private sector.Read Post | CommentsDoug Kendall, 06.03.2011Founder and President, Constitutional Accountability CenterJudicial independence depends upon the public\u0027s confidence that the federal judiciary is something more than a third political branch. Correspondingly, judicial independence has never been more imperiled than it is today.Read Post | CommentsDavid Katz, M.D., 06.03.2011Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterI confront the polarizing topic of abortion with equal measures of trepidation and resolve to state: I am emphatically pro-choice. And I am just as emphatically anti-abortion.Read Post | CommentsMeredith Bagby, 06.03.2011Author, Publisher, Annual Report USASarah Palin has defied all bounds of normal political chutzpah. Despite being lambasted by the media she just keeps going, just like... you guessed it... the Honey Badger.Read Post | CommentsBrady Boyd, 06.03.2011Senior Pastor, New Life ChurchHave we, as American pastors, given up our calling as shepherds and unknowingly become fast food entrepreneurs who are building a religious business and not a church?Read Post | CommentsMike Lux, 06.03.2011Author, The Progressive Revolution: How the Best in America Came to BeIt\u0027s unfortunate that some community bankers have gotten caught up on the wrong side of this battle, but the bottom line couldn\u0027t be clearer. Swipe fee regulation is a straightforward fight between Main Street and Wall Street.Read Post | CommentsJason Linkins, 06.02.2011Editor, Eat the PressInstead of the current format for campaign reporting, in which reporters are dispatched to cover candidates and then return to measure the responses of Americans, reporters should instead be dispatched to cover America and force the candidates to follow.Read Post | CommentsEmma Bonino, Mark Leonard, Ana Palacio and Daniel Sachs, 06.03.2011Europe\u0027s response to the Arab Spring has been lacking in ambition, imagination and generosity. From the actions and words of European leaders there has been too much focus on halting the flow of migrants and not enough on the historic opportunity before us.Read Post | CommentsDr. Dean Ornish, 06.03.2011Medical Editor, The Huffington Post, Founder and President of Preventive Medicine Research InstituteRather than being concerned about how to raise your \"good\" cholesterol, eat a whole foods, plant-based diet--and spend a few minutes a day exercising, meditating, and loving more.Read Post | CommentsRussell Simmons, 06.03.2011Founder of GlobalGrind.comMy whole life I have never stopped dreaming. We all have dreams, but here is what is different about dreams today: now is the time to dream big, because even during tough times like these, you can still make your dreams happen.Read Post | CommentsDavid Wagner, 06.03.2011Director of Crisis Communications, Country Risk SolutionsOne has to wonder how long Tokyo Electric Power should call the shots. There is something inherently wrong with allowing the hen to rule the hen house. Yet that is what is happening.Read Post | CommentsJohann Hari, 06.03.2011Columnist, the London IndependentThere\u0027s an inane debate in the press about who should be the next head of the IMF. If we took the idea of human equality seriously, we would be discussing how to disband the IMF entirely and start again.Read Post | CommentsAngora Holly Polo, 06.03.2011The Donnybrook Writing AcademyMusic festivals are much like the Boy Scouts in that it\u0027s very important to be prepared. Here\u0027s how we have prepared ourselves for the Telluride Bluegrass Festival, June 16th-19th.Read Post | CommentsDavid Wild, 06.03.2011TV Writer, Rolling Stone Contributing Editor and author, \u0027He Is... I Say\u0027Spike\u0027s Guys Choice Awards is a spirited celebration of the things men love and has become an annual star-studded Guyaplooza.Read Post | CommentsRep. Keith Ellison, 06.03.2011U.S. Congressman from Minnesota\u0027s 5th DistrictI wonder how long House Republicans are going to continue playing ideological games with the economy. Dilly-dallying with the debt ceiling is clearly the wrong direction for our country.Read Post | CommentsRobert Reich, 06.03.2011Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Aftershock\u0027The May jobs report is a disaster -- the weakest reading since September. The recovery has stalled. And while we\u0027re not in a double-dip recession yet, the odds of it are increasing.Read Post | CommentsWill Durst, 06.03.2011Political comic, former radio talk show host, syndicated columnist, author, motivational speakerLike corroded clockwork, the Republicans once again find themselves in the middle of a public relations disaster the size of Jupiter\u0027s largest moon, Ganymede. Specifically, their plan to reform Medicare, which some folks say is akin to a tornado\u0027s plan to reform trailer courts.Read Post | CommentsBant Breen, 06.03.2011EntrepreneurCould we ever incorporate an idea like siesta into the US working day? Could we set aside our five-hour energy drinks for a nap instead?Read Post | CommentsHeidi Cullen, 06.03.2011Climate scientist, Climate Central\"Is this global warming?\" \"Is climate change to blame?\" \"Is the weather getting worse?\" These are big -- almost existential -- questions. I suspect they are a polite way of asking, \"Is this our fault?\"Read Post | CommentsClare Richardson, 06.02.2011Associate Blog Editor, The Huffington PostI sat down with string theorist Brian Greene and six-time Emmy and Golden Globe Award winner Alan Alda to discuss how science can be re-conceptualized from boring classroom lectures into a wondrously exciting narrative.Read Post | CommentsDon McNay, 2011.06.04HuffPost TV, 2011.06.03David Wagner, 2011.06.03Raghida Dergham, 2011.06.03Turnstyle, 2011.06.03Jessica Levinson, 2011.06.03Turnstyle, 2011.06.03Michael Weinstein, 2011.06.03Gretchen Rubin, 2011.06.03Youth Radio -- Youth Media International, 2011.06.03","h1":"Using a mobile device?
