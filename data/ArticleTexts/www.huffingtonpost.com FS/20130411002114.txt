{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThe JobRaising Challenge, our effort to raise money, increase awareness and support nonprofits working to create jobs, yielded more than $1.5 million in donations -- most of them under $100. Now, knowing just how much impact we can have, and how many organizations are eager to make a difference, we are again asking how we can raise money and awareness, this time to tap into the potential of women-focused nonprofits. So I\u0027m delighted to announce The RaiseForWomen Challenge, an initiative to help women-focused nonprofits gain resources and recognition, in partnership with The Skoll Foundation, Crowdrise, and Sheryl WuDunn and Nick Kristof\u0027s Half the Sky Movement. The initiative coincides with a women\u0027s conference I\u0027m co-hosting with Mika Brzezinski on June 6, on the theme of \"Redefining Success: The Third Metric.\" To sign up to participate in the Challenge and invest in women who are changing the world, click here.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorRepublican intransigence on tax revenues will continue to produce the gridlock that\u0027s ground fiscal policy to a halt, though perhaps now even the most misguided commentators will not be able to frame this as \"a pox on both their houses!\"Comments (73)Sharon K. D’AgostinoVice President, Corporate Citizenship at Johnson \u0026 JohnsonA worldwide 1,000-day countdown begins today and has the potential to accelerate efforts to save and improve millions of lives by the end of 2015.Comments (4)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The president\u0027s predilection for negotiating with himself is not new. But his willingness to do it with Social Security, the government\u0027s most popular program -- which Democrats have protected from Republican assaults for almost eighty years -- doesn\u0027t bode well.Comments (335)Jonah BergerAuthor, \u0027Contagious: Why Things Catch On\u0027Want to know why things go viral? Why some products get more word of mouth? Let me tell you a secret. It\u0027s not luck.CommentsDr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarWhat a better time than this, National Poetry Month, to enter another sort of discussion: the common space poems create for reflection -- on the challenges we face, the choices we make, and the invaluable importance of all women do.CommentsArianna HuffingtonHow can the human brain not perceive something that\u0027s right in front of it? I\u0027m talking about the massive jobs crisis in which the country remains mired.Comments (880)Marty KaplanDirector, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolThere are good reasons to be skeptical of machines grading essays. Their algorithms can\u0027t distinguish between arguments supported by factual evidence and cases built on canards. They\u0027re reliable enough to dock points for clichés, but they\u0027re not subtle enough to reward subtlety.CommentsShelley EmlingEditor, Post 50So what are some things one should never say to one\u0027s dearly beloved? After speaking with Grossman, as well as with some other relationship experts, Huff/Post50 came up with the following list of nine things to never say to your spouse.Comments (735)Russell BrandActor and comedianWhen I was a kid, Thatcher was the headmistress of our country. Her voice, a bellicose yawn, somehow both boring and boring -- I could ignore the content but the intent drilled its way in. I am, safe to say, one of Thatcher\u0027s children. How then do I feel on this day of matriarchal mourning?Comments (668)Robert CreamerPolitical Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersAmerica is not broke. We are not in a time of \"scarcity\" and when we buy into this fallacy, we contribute to political decisions that actually will do damage to our standard of living and that of our children.Comments (1,752)Craig KanalleySenior Editor, Big News \u0026 Live Events, The Huffington PostThe first time I saw the HTC First, a Facebook employee gave a demonstration of it. Yeah, seems cool. Alright. I get it. But I want to see my friends on it... Now I have one to test myself. And as expected, what a difference that makes. Let me show you how it works.CommentsMarlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistIf your nose is itchy and running as you read this, don\u0027t just reach for a tissue -- pour yourself a cup of peppermint tea, too. I\u0027ll explain. For all of the wonderful things that come with spring -- the sun, the flowers, the singing birds, even the spring cleaning -- there is one aspect of the season that is not so wonderful: allergies!Comments (53)Sarah JenksFounder of Live More Weigh LessSo many of us have been taught that we need to \"weigh less in order to live more,\" but I really believe we have to live more in order to weigh less. We have to stop waiting on the weight and start having fun -- only then will we finally stop being a slave to food and get out of body jail.Comments (62)Reese SchonfeldTelevision journalistThis morning\u0027s Washington Post provides the best reporting yet on the new CNN and Jeff Zucker\u0027s intentions. It\u0027s good reporting, but it fails to consider CNN\u0027s early years and early strategy. I created CNN as the antithesis of the then three major networks.CommentsChristopher LambProfessor of Journalism, University of Indiana-IndianapolisThere is no greater story in sports than Robinson breaking baseball\u0027s color line on April 15, 1947. Yet there was little sense of that history that day in the sports pages of daily newspapers, even in New York City.CommentsDavid CoatesWorrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsWe are told that Obama\u0027s budget will trade \"modest entitlement savings\" for immediate tax hikes on the corporate rich. If that is so, the trade that will be proposed tomorrow will reflect poor judgment -- poor moral judgment, poor economic judgment and poor political judgment.Comments (158)Jennifer ArmstrongAuthor, pop culture writer, co-founder, SexyFeminist.comWe\u0027re unequivocally in favor of marriage equality. But this lower \"level\" of commitment has been worth something in its own right to us -- not just for the health benefits, but for the ways it helped us see exactly what we wanted from our relationship.Comments (16)Ken Dychtwald Ph.D.Gerontologist, psychologist, author, entrepreneur and public speakerHow will the boomers\u0027 desire to stay socially engaged give rise to a revolution in mentoring, volunteering and philanthropreneuring? What are the personal, social and financial challenges of each of the five stages of retirement.Comments (13)Peter Alexander MeyersAuthor, professor, political theoristThe most important instrument we have for formulating and controlling everyday action -- our imagination -- has been off-loaded to screens and boxes with industrial abandon. This is the underpinning of our cinematic culture and it sustains the abuse of guns.Comments (802)Barbara Bush and Maimunat Alex-AdeomiWe recognize the work of mothers worldwide who ensure their families receive the vital and necessary care they need to live full and healthy lives. In turn, the global community should offer the support needed to these women.CommentsJamie MalanowskiAuthor of \u0027The Book of Levon: The Trials and Triumphs of Levon Helm\u0027Roger Ebert, Levon Helm, Sixto Rodriquez -- models of stoicism. They are men who met disappointment and worse, and faced their challenges with determination and courage. We used to have a lot of role models like them.Comments (11)Mike RagognaMusic Biz VetAs a respite from the deafening hullabaloo surrounding \"Accidental Racist,\" here\u0027s a sneak peak at another brand new Brad Paisley/LL Cool J track, \"Live For You.\"CommentsDavid FreudbergHost of the public radio series “Humankind”To the extent the ACA serves the humane purpose of preventing vulnerable people from falling through the cracks, it means these patients must be accommodated by our health care infrastructure.CommentsRobert NaimanPolicy Director, Just Foreign PolicySay what you want about President Obama\u0027s proposal to cut Social Security and veterans\u0027 benefits with the \"chained CPI.\" He did accomplish one thing for liberals that they often have a hard time doing on their own. He united them -- in opposition to his proposal.Comments (230)David LandselContributing editor at Airfarewatchdog.comAnd where you should go instead.Comments (1,274)Allison TateAuthor, mother of fourHow do I raise my baby girl to love -- or, at the very least, not to hate -- the same features I have picked apart for so long?Comments (109)Sen.

And it\u0027s way too easy.CommentsLaila AlawaMuslim-American activist, blogger and outspoken feministI have not heard a single Muslim woman speak out about how she now feels freed due to the FEMEN protests. Why is that the case? Is it because all of the -- as Inna so condescendingly put it -- \"bearded men with knives\" are holding Muslim women back from speaking out? No.Comments (219)Andre Leon TalleyContributing editor, VogueThe best of me comes from my grandmother\u0027s values and her traditions.CommentsRussell SimmonsFounder, GlobalGrind.comFor 42 years, we have waged war against our own people that we have disguised as the \"War on Drugs.\" Forty-two years of failure that has cost the American taxpayers $1 trillion, resulted in 45 million drug arrests, and overfilled America\u0027s prisons while failing to reduce the availability, sale, or use of drugs in the United States.Comments (776)Chris Weigant, 2013.10.04Peter Diamandis, 2013.10.04Noel Irwin Hentschel, 2013.10.04Kolleen Bouchane, 2013.10.04Alison van Diggelen, 2013.10.04Andrea Grossman, 2013.10.04Jeremy Kadden, 2013.10.04Pete Wilgoren, 2013.10.04Joe Schrank, 2013.10.04Kelly Bulkeley, Ph.D., 2013.10.04Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"BUDGET TO NOWHERE",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
