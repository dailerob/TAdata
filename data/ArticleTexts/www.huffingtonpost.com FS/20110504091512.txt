{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureThe White House will be tempted to use the Osama bin Laden moment to claim their laurels. The president has turned an economy in free fall around, kept his promise to draw down in Iraq and to refocus on the terrorists who attacked us on 9-11. He can run on a record of accomplishment and good judgment. But, however tempting, that would be a mistake. The best hope for Obama and the country is for the president to use this moment when his judgment and leadership are being praised to focus Americans on the challenges we face at home. To do so, he\u0027ll have to change course dramatically.Read Post | CommentsEd Schultz, 05.03.2011Host, MSNBC\u0027s \u0027The Ed Show\u0027 at 10PM ETPresident Obama acted decisively. There wasn\u0027t any jingoism going on, no cowboy talk, just a lot of dignity and class. How\u0027s that for change you can believe in?Read Post | CommentsJason Linkins, 05.03.2011Editor, Eat the PressAmanpour alluded to a source who suggested bin Laden had stashed himself in a \"nice comfortable villa\" in Pakistan.

That\u0027s the proposal emerging in the Senate from Republican Bob Corker of Tennessee and also Democrat Claire McCaskill of Missouri.Read Post | CommentsScott Mendelson, 05.03.2011Film CriticIf this film works at all, it is as an acting treat.

Now that bin Laden is dead, I hope that feeling is also dead.Read Post | CommentsRocky Kistner, 05.03.2011Media associate, NRDCOpening federal waters to drilling, while cutting governmental oversight and safety measures, is sort of like telling the designer of the Titanic to forget about the icebergs and just build more ships. Full speed ahead!Read Post | CommentsJohn Feffer, 05.03.2011Co-director, Foreign Policy In FocusWe have, once again, played right into Osama bin Laden\u0027s hands.
