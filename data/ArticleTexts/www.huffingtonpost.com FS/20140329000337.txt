{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"David BromwichProfessor of Literature, Yale UniversityObama\u0027s Brussels oration bore a striking resemblance to his Nobel Prize speech in 2009. Yesterday\u0027s effort was shorter and less pompous, but, in Brussels as in Oslo, Obama\u0027s words again carried the patina of American superiority. The attitude emerged most starkly where he went furthest to disown it: \"We Americans remember well the unimaginable sacrifices made by the Russian people in World War II, and we have honored those sacrifices.\" Do we remember those sacrifices? How exactly have we shown that we honor them -- in which administration and by what series of actions? If President Obama wanted to help us remember, he could have cited some numbers. Three hundred thousand Americans died in the Second World War: a terrible and frightening number. Twenty million Russians died -- one Russian out of eight. Educated Europeans know this. Few Americans of any generation know it.Comments (153)TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"Rebecca Black. Double rainbows. Nyan cat. Why do some videos made by ordinary people become internet sensations? And what do the videos we love say about who we are? YouTube\u0027s Kevin Allocca breaks it down in this nostalgic viral video tour.CommentsCarla ShutakArtistFive years later I still cry. I cry for our hard work which benefits only the banking industry and the super-rich. I cry because the government bailed out the banks who call us irresponsible. I cry because we work four times harder for half the income and will never catch up again.Comments (116)Emad Shahin, Noam Chomsky and Robert SpringborgIf the United States does not take an unambiguous position and demonstrate unmistaken resolve against Egypt\u0027s current undemocratic path, and if your administration decides to resume suspended aid programs in the face of growing repression and brutality, your words on democracy and human rights will ring hollow.Comments (11)Devon CornealMother, writer, lawyerComplaining about how hard she has it while romanticizing the lives of working parents with more traditional careers means Gwyneth is either remarkably self-absorbed or deliberately obtuse.Comments (36)Jillian BermanBusiness Reporter, The Huffington PostMy lunch is boring. It can get especially tiresome at the end of a long week when I have the same thing every day. But it fulfills my most important qualifications for a successful work lunch: It\u0027s filling and cheap.Comments (262)Gov. Martin O\u0027MalleyGovernor of MarylandThat\u0027s the good news. But not every loving family with same-sex parents lives in a state where their legal rights are protected. And many transgender Americans live in the 32 states where they can still lawfully be denied a job or a home solely on the basis of their identity. That is not right. And those laws need to change.CommentsMarian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundDuring this last week of Women’s History Month, I wanted you to learn about Ella Baker, a transforming but too-little-known woman and overpowering justice warrior for my generation of civil rights activists.CommentsDarren AronofskyFilmmakerThis is our garden. We have dominion over it. Are we tending it? Are we keeping it? Will we stand before it with Awe and Reverence, or will we corrupt our way upon it?Comments (124)Dr. Tim MainardiPhysician, researcher and educatorSpring is finally rolling around the corner, and for most of us, that\u0027s a big relief. For many others, however, this revival of life also means the return of sneezing, coughing, wheezing, itching and other vexing symptoms of spring allergies, commonly known as hay fever.CommentsScott DannemillerWriter, blogger, worship leader and former missionary with the Presbyterian ChurchSomeday, Audrey, you\u0027ll hear a voice. It might be the voice of your friends. Maybe a shout from a picture in a magazine. Or, Heaven forbid, a comment from your boyfriend. And that voice is going to tell you that you don\u0027t have the right clothes, the right makeup or the right face.CommentsAsh MurthySoftware engineer at GoogleIn search of the American Dream, I had come halfway around the planet to pursue graduate studies in computer science at the University of Southern California. Little did I then know that the green pastures are not so green, at least not without a green card.CommentsSusan CainAuthor, New York Times Bestseller \u0027QUIET: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can\u0027t Stop Talking\u0027In honor of Arianna Huffington\u0027s marvelous book THRIVE, I want to write about a very specific aspect of well-being: freedom from fear of sharing one\u0027s ideas.Comments (11)Steve NelsonHead of the Calhoun School in ManhattanThis is a mere sideshow. Comparing schools -- charter vs. neighborhood public; suburban vs. urban; public vs. private -- is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of education in America.Comments (12)Azhar MajeedDirector, Individual Rights Education Program, Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE)Much worse than the problems inherent in Twitter use, to me, is what this controversy demonstrates about many people\u0027s inability to digest satire and think critically about what it is saying.CommentsJill DoughertyShorenstein Center fellowOnly national unity, in which the individual sets aside his own welfare for the good of the country, Putin believes, can ensure the nation will survive. Russia is a unique civilization, fully entitled to reject the values forced down its throat by the West.Comments (39)Yalda T. UhlsPsychologist, Researcher, Speaker, MomI believe that TED Youth and YouTube together have great potential -- to inspire youth to use these powerful platforms to change the world and tell great stories. Moreover, as a psychologist who studies how these simple and easily accessible online tools shape youth values, I thought he missed an opportunity to inspire the youth who were so eagerly listening to his speech.CommentsH. Alan ScottWriter, Comedian, ManI know what you\u0027re thinking, another Obamacare story. But this one is different, I swear. Stay with me here. No matter what you think about the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare), we can all agree that people should have access to affordable health care, right?CommentsStephen SchlesingerAuthor and Fellow at the Century FoundationIn the face of immense pressures, several of its organs have taken public positions on controversial issues which have advanced the goals of the organization even as they have offended various member states, including, in one case, a permanent member.CommentsLinda LajtermanRegistered nurseWe saw real and true tears at Danny\u0027s funeral from many of the hundreds of kids who came. We have also learned that a few days later, many were back to business as usual waiting for the next chance to get wasted at whatever excuse there is for a party.CommentsDavid HalperinAttorney, advocate, writer at RepublicReport.orgPredatory for-profit colleges use deceptive and coercive tactics to pressure students into signing up. More than half of for-profit college students drop out within about four months.CommentsRep. Jared Huffman, Rep. Alan Lowenthal and Rep. Beto O’RourkeWe believe there are several reforms needed to fight back against the scourge of unlimited and secretive campaign spending, bring transparency and accountability to the system, and, more importantly, support a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United.CommentsJim WallisChristian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersI live in Washington, D.C., a city in which mistakes are messaged and shortcomings are spun. True confession and true repentance do not occur -- unless it is politically advantageous. Naturally, cynicism runs rampant. In this environment, though we all know our own weaknesses, grace is rarely offered for failures.CommentsSteve DeAngeloFounder, Harborside Health CentersNow that a majority of Americans live in states that have reformed cannabis laws, the only smart and decent thing to do is to fully restore the civil rights, privileges -- and reputations -- of those convicted during the years of prohibition.Comments (11)Eric BoehlertSenior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaThe pressing, constitutional question wasn\u0027t whether Nixon himself had drawn up the harebrained scheme to break into Democratic Party offices inside the Watergate apartment complex in 1972. It was whether Nixon knew his underlings were running a criminal enterprise from inside the executive offices. The same holds true for Christie today.Comments (18)Mark AlpertAuthor of the science-fiction thriller \u0027Extinction\u0027 and the forthcoming novel \u0027The Furies\u0027Imagine a novel that starts like this: A speck of space imbued with a mysterious antigravity substance explodes to humongous size in a tiny fraction of a second and transforms into an entire universe. Sounds ridiculous, right? And yet most cosmologists believe this is how the Big Bang began.CommentsNica NoelleWriter, producer and director of adult filmsWhile filming explicit sex continues to bear the damning label of pornography, its narrative value becomes obvious when a \"serious\" film ventures to include it, yet fails to consider it\u0027s meaning -- or to share that meaning with its audience.CommentsSeamus McKiernanSenior Blog Editor, Special Projects, Huffington PostMaybe it makes sense for Burger King and the NCAA to partner on TV commercials this March Madness. But it\u0027s wrong that college athletes and fast food workers are forced to play the serfs in a feudal system that only rewards the overlords.CommentsKelli CatanaBlogger, www.kellidaisy.comI am a bad parent. And I am a good parent. I am your typical, average parent. I had four kids in five years and I\u0027m pretty sure that I was a bit insane for about three and a half of them. I am guilty of being bossy and I am guilty of shoving electronics into my children\u0027s hands if it buys me peace.Comments (51)Jacqueline NovogratzFounder and CEO of AcumenArianna Huffington has nailed it. We Thrive when we move from a place of wonder and generosity. We Thrive when we are used for good. It is not always easy, and rarely connected to a more facile quest for \"happiness.\" To Thrive, really, is to be grounded in a state of grace.CommentsJenny WitteFounder and blogger, Mamatoga.comDuring her entire pregnancy, I\u0027m pretty sure her body was present and accounted for. She was, in fact, using that body to create another human life, so how did she \"get it back,\" and from where?CommentsBecky Hayes, 2014.28.03Belle Beth Cooper, 2014.28.03Dr. Amy Fairchild, 2014.28.03Stewart Wolpin, 2014.28.03The Nature Conservancy in California, 2014.28.03Bob Aiken, 2014.28.03Uloop, 2014.28.03Michael Anthony Fernandez, 2014.28.03Kathleen Buckstaff, 2014.28.03Thomas Bick, 2014.28.03Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"REPORT: RUSSIA THREATENED NATIONS BEFORE VOTE",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
