{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Politics Editor, Huffington PostConference calls do not a candidacy make -- or unmake. Nevertheless, I just hung up on one featuring Mike Huckabee that did nothing to contradict the rapidly-gathering conventional wisdom that he is not running again in 2012. Huckabee sounded like a wary, skeptical guy who didn\u0027t have the stomach for the grueling humiliations of a presidential run.

Secretary of Labor; Professor at Berkeley; Author, Aftershock: \u0027The Next Economy and America\u0027s Future\u0027America is the richest nation in the world, and we\u0027ve never been richer. There\u0027s no reason for us to turn on our teachers, our unionized workers, our poor and needy, and our elderly. The notion that we can no longer afford it is claptrap.Read Post | CommentsMarty Kaplan, 02.21.2011Director, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolSitting on the hilltop, watching Americans turn one another into bogeymen, evading scrutiny and responsibility, are the real sources of our distress.Read Post | CommentsMedea Benjamin, 02.21.2011Co-founder, CODEPINK: Women for PeaceMy travels from Cairo to Madison seem like one seamless web. An Egyptian held a sign in Tahrir Square saying \"Egypt Supports Wisconsin Workers -- One World, One Pain.\" Solidarity is, indeed, a beautiful thing.Read Post | CommentsDavid Katz, M.D., 02.21.2011Director of Yale University\u0027s Prevention Research CenterAdvice to \u0027eat less\u0027 tends to go over like the proverbial lead balloon. But trading foods that let us eat until full, but that make us full on fewer calories, is another matter entirely.Read Post | CommentsJason Linkins, 02.21.2011Editor, Eat the PressAnonymous blog commenters: I\u0027m sure they are nice people, but please do not use them as sources, especially in such a misleading fashion.Read Post | CommentsDean Baker, 02.21.2011Co-Director of the Center for Economic and Policy ResearchGreenspan has been strangely missing from the fierce battle over the future of public-sector unions in Wisconsin. His absence is strange because he bears more responsibility for the current conflict than anyone else alive.Read Post | CommentsMalou Innocent, 02.21.2011Foreign Policy Analyst, Cato InstituteThe Raymond Davis case is just the latest example of how the foreign occupation of Afghanistan -- and Pakistan\u0027s acquiescence to American policy -- spawns more recruits for al Qaeda-linked groups seeking to hasten Pakistan\u0027s disintegration.Read Post | CommentsGary Hart, 02.21.2011Scholar in Residence at the University of ColoradoSo said Winston Churchill who then added the punchline: \"... except for all the others.\" Any doubts about this observations should be erased by current developments in both the Middle East and in Madison, Wisconsin.Read Post | CommentsAlon Ben-Meir, 02.21.2011Senior Fellow at NYU\u0027s Center for Global AffairsNo revolution can make social, political and economic progress by becoming hostile to its neighbors, especially, in this case, Israel -- with whom Egypt has no quarrel.Read Post | CommentsPeter Neill, 02.21.2011Director, World Ocean ObservatoryJust one more look back, please, lest we forget. The Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico provides a telling example of how to calculate the true cost of \"progress.\"Read Post | CommentsLarry Strauss, 02.21.2011Veteran high school English teacher, basketball coach, novelistPardon me for not believing in a test that purports to measure a student\u0027s writing ability by asking multiple choice questions.Read Post | CommentsLinda Flanagan and Sarah Sangree, 02.21.2011It\u0027s hard to make sense of Exit Through the Giftshop\u0027s nomination in the documentary category, except as a ploy by the Academy to remain relevant with a younger audience.Read Post | CommentsRose Ann DeMoro, 02.21.2011Executive Director, National Nurses United, AFL-CIO and California Nurses AssociationWorking people did not create the recession or the budgetary crisis facing federal, state and local governments. And there can be no more concessions, period.Read Post | CommentsRobert Kuttner, 02.20.2011Co-founder and co-editor of The American ProspectThe Republicans\u0027 miscalculation in Wisconsin was to declare war on the one bastion of organized economic representation of regular people -- the labor movement.Read Post | CommentsRep. Jackie Speier, 02.20.2011U.S. Congresswoman from CaliforniaIn our nation\u0027s political dictionary, \"abortion\" is a word employed by intolerant people to cast shame on women who choose it.Read Post | CommentsMike Lux, 02.21.2011Author, The Progressive Revolution: How the Best in America Came to BePitting workers against workers for the scraps of the economic system is a tried and true tactic, but there is no envy on our side of these demonstrations: people just want a fair shake.Read Post | CommentsDan Dorfman, 02.21.2011Financial Columnist, Market CommentatorIn 2012, the nation will expect a considerably better economy, especially on the employment and housing fronts. But the glum housing outlook with its negative economic consequences suggests that may not happen.Read Post | CommentsJordan Zakarin, 02.21.2011Associate Entertainment Editor, The Huffington PostWe don\u0027t have a budget deficit, we have a budget distortion. A case of misplaced priorities. Millionaires over teachers, hospital workers, firefighters. Sounds about right.Read Post | CommentsSteve Stoute, 02.20.2011Founder and CEO; TranslationOver the course of my 20-year history as an executive in the music business, I have come to the conclusion that the Grammy Awards have clearly lost touch with contemporary popular culture.Read Post | CommentsShirin Sadeghi, 02.20.2011Host, New America Now. Former producer, the BBC and Al Jazeera.For most Iranians, the Green Movement is what the international media is calling the massive mobilization to dismantle the Islamic Republic of Iran. The hope is that change will finally open the door to serious reform.Read Post | CommentsJoseph Rocha, 02.20.2011U.S. Navy Veteran, Senior at the University of San DiegoThere were indeed flaws in the investigation of the anti-gay abuse I experienced while a sailor in the U.S. Navy in Bahrain. But AP\u0027s conclusion is wrong. The notion that I asked to be hazed is egregious and painful.Read Post | CommentsMichael Brenner, 02.21.2011Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghIt\u0027s obvious that our foreign policy is to navigate abroad without a strategic gyroscope and only the most primitive of compasses. There is no strategic design -- certainly not an explicit one -- that is coherently articulated.Read Post | CommentsTamar Abrams, 02.19.2011Communications Strategist for NonprofitsMy first encounter with Planned Parenthood was in 1978 as a college freshman.
