{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Novelist and contributing opinion writerFor the established Republican order, the vista presented by this new year is filled with bewilderment and foreboding. For the last 28 years of presidential primaries, the consultants, donors and loyalists who constituted the party\u0027s so-called mainstream have taken it for granted that, in the end, the \"most electable conservative\" would once again ward off insurrection by the Visigoths of the GOP\u0027s outer reaches. This serene state of self-assurance has come to an abrupt and unseemly end. The only surprise is that they seem so surprised. Over that span of time the meaning of \"conservative\" has moved ever rightward in the gravitational pull of evangelicals, gun rights absolutists, economically and socially threatened whites and, most recently, indignant Tea Party adherents who, collectively, have come to dominate the primary electorate.Two powerful universities whose wrongdoings were exposed in The Hunting Ground have gone to great lengths to attack the accounts of survivors: Harvard Law, which protected an assailant who was repeatedly found to have committed assault, and Florida State University, which covered up a rape investigation of its star quarterback.Filmmaker, \"The Hunting Ground\"Filmmaker, \"The Hunting Ground\"President Obama has taken the moral high ground when others would not. He has listened to the American people who are crying out for the carnage to stop when Congress would not. He has decided to be on the right side of history when others would not. He has decided to save lives when other leaders would not.Parents of Aurora victim Jessica GhawiWhen your child dies there is no moving on. Of course you do feel better in yourself as the years go by, but time is not the great healer it is promised to be. Time becomes part of the grief itself as you count the birthdays and missed milestones. My son, Louis, would be 13 years old tomorrow.Fashion designer and activistHere\u0027s the bottom line: The middle class is in crisis, and Secretary Clinton\u0027s proposals merely tinker at the margins of that crisis. They would not shift the fundamental direction of an economy that is growing more unequal every day.Co-Director, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureThe Saudi decision to start the new year with mass executions bore the hallmarks of a calculated move.Editor, Middle East EyeThe Force has awoken within its hero, Rey. We have a multilayered and complex heroine at the forefront of the action, who serves as the heart of the storyline, not relegated to being a \"sideshow badass\" as too many female characters in action and science fiction cinema have been.Research AssociateThe daily shootings in America\u0027s inner cities are all too frequent reminders of the tragic impact of gun violence on our national well-being. Some studies suggest that repeated exposure to shootings in urban areas is akin to the trauma suffered by soldiers in war zones.Congressional Black Caucus Health Braintrust Chair, health equity advocate, representative for Illinois\u0027 2nd District.Colorado and other pioneering states are showing us what a reality-based, public health approach to marijuana looks like.Colorado Manager, Drug Policy AllianceAs 2015 ended, this country was certifiably terror-stricken. It had the Islamic State (IS) on the brain. Hoax terror threats or terror imbroglios shut down school systems from Los Angeles to New Hampshire, Indiana to a rural county in Virginia.Editor, TomDispatch.comThe Donald is not important to American politics because he might become the president. He\u0027s important because he is accelerating an already dangerous losing strategy for the GOP, making them more accountable to a small, volatile part of the electorate. May God save our country from Donald Trump.Soldier, Iowan, Student, and most importantly, lover of good pie!Patent and copyright protection are not laws of nature, they come from the government. And in recent years we have been making them stronger and longer. As a result, these forms of protection apply to a much wider range of products, which means the products of technology cost us much more money.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027It\u0027s not enough for individual believers to worship God as they see fit -- a right which I and most Americans are happy to acknowledge and protect. According to Scalia, the government must place its thumb on the scale and promote and advance religion over non-religion.President \u0026 CEO, Center for Inquiry; Author of The Necessity of SecularismZuckerberg is on the defensive because he doesn\u0027t understand the culture and values of Indians. He doesn\u0027t realize that Ganesh cherishes the freedom that India gained from its British colonizers in 1947 and doesn\u0027t want a handout from a Western company. Ganesh may be poor, but he doesn\u0027t want anyone to dictate what sites he can visit, what movies he may watch, or what applications he can download.Academic, Researcher, Writer, EntrepreneurAlarmists will use such an incident as an excuse to raise the issue of culture clash. But sociopathic behavior is sociopathic behavior, regardless of the alleged background of the perpetrators.Freelance journalist and authorWe are beginning to see signs that Congress may be willing to move beyond the partisan divide over the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which hopefully means that we can fix problems with current law, build upon what is working, and continue to make progress in improving our nation\u0027s health care system. It is about time.President, First Focus \u0026 First Focus Campaign for ChildrenBuilding a comprehensive paid leave system should form a core part of Governor Cuomo\u0027s 2016 agenda -- and like the other ambitious elements of that agenda, the governor should go big.Senior Policy Analyst at DemosThe gender revolution offers an opportunity for every parent to teach our kids that there\u0027s not just a spectrum of masculinity to femininity out there in the world -- but inside each of us as well.Therapist, consultant, trainerIf these were conservationists using a paramilitary action to protest the failure of federal policies to protect national wildlife refuges or parks like the Everglades -- where the federal EPA has aligned with polluters like Big Sugar -- how quickly do you think the FBI and justice department would intervene?Writer and environmental activistIt won\u0027t be easy for Neymar to avoid this bloodthirsty opponent called intolerance. Stupidity has no consideration for status, fame or the proficiency with a soccer ball.Writer, HuffPost BrazilI have a very rare neurological disorder that renders me unable to feel pain, temperature and touch in the same way most people do. I don\u0027t have reflexes and can\u0027t regulate my own body temperature. I\u0027m deaf. I also can\u0027t do things like tie my own shoes. Did I mention I just moved away from home?College student living with a rare neurological disorder, and dedicated to a career as a writer, storyteller and advocateTrump\u0027s rallies are as hot a commodity as Jerry Springer tickets. His \"fans\" are there for the spectacle not the substance. They want the hockey fight, not the game itself. The game bores them. They just come for the brawls and bloodshed. And Trump gives \u0027em plenty of both. \"Don-ald, Don-ald, Don-ald!\"Political and Pop Culture AnalystEveryone else\u0027s chances for victory almost require Trump\u0027s support in the polls to suffer serious damage. If nobody else manages to break into the front rank, then Trump is the best-positioned candidate to win the nomination -- hands down.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.com\"I think if you ask just about any bass player in any style, their top five bass players, Jaco\u0027s always going to be right in there. If not one or two, he\u0027s definitely going to be a top five cat.\"Trafficbeat Entertainment, Music Biz VetYears later, when I wrote my book The Only Way Out Is Through, I realized how these very steps suggested by my professor were the same steps needed to re-enter the workplace.

Ditch perfectionism and find peaceful-ism!Writer, Trainer, Coach - finding hidden messages in everyday lifeI\u0027ve rounded up some portion-control tricks which can help you get 2016 off to a great start and help you shed unwanted pounds. Many of these tricks are rooted in behavior change which serve as cues to gently remind us to eat mindfully... to eat when hungry... to eat more slowly... and to eat less.Internationally-recognized nutritionist; International Speaker; Adjunct professor of nutrition at NYU; Author, \u0027The Portion Teller Plan\u0027As President Obama prepares to deliver his final State of the Union address on January 12, it\u0027s difficult to remember how incredibly bad the economy was when he took office seven years ago and how important financial reform is to getting the economy working again for all Americans.President and CEO, Better Markets, Inc.\"The first thing I would do is break up the banks so that they are much smaller and they could all fail.\"Movie critic, corporate governance analystThe success of The Force Awakens should have been celebrated as an unreserved triumph for Carrie Fisher and yet, the movie not yet three weeks in theaters, it is instead dragging out old issues that she\u0027s struggled with her entire life.Writer and blogger, grahamscrackers.comGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
