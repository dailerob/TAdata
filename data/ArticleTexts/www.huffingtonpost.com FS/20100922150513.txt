{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"The Tea Party is angry! Really, really angry. So we are told again and again by the media. What\u0027s missing from this narrative is the fact that everybody is angry -- even people who love the president, and wouldn\u0027t dream of voting for anyone other than a Democrat. And it\u0027s not hard to understand why. How can you look at what\u0027s happening in America and not be angry? But if we keep associating anger exclusively with the Tea Party, our public debate becomes a false choice between the status quo and an agenda that would, quite simply, destroy America. There is more than one way to channel anger. Yes, you can demonize and divide and scapegoat. But anger can also be harnessed and redirected -- the energy behind it used to connect, to reach out, to take action, to make life better both for your family and for others who need help. And there are tens of thousands across America doing just that.Read Post | CommentsBob Cesca, 09.22.2010Host of the Bob and Elvis ShowThe sooner politicians embrace the reality of a center-left America, the sooner they\u0027ll actually stand up for progressive legislation, rather than running like half-baked Republican knockoffs.
