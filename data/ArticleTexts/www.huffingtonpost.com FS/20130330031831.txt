{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOThe U.S. equity market had a great finish to a wonderful first three months of 2013. In logging its best first-quarter performance since 1987 (11 percent), the Dow set yet another all-time high. For its part, the S\u0026P surged 10 percent, ending above its previous (2007) record close. The rally reflects slowly-improving economic conditions, relatively robust corporate profitability and anticipation of stronger domestic and foreign inflows into the equity market. Yet this is far from the whole story. Investors need only look at where some other benchmarks ended the quarter to get a feel for the unprecedented and artificial nature of today\u0027s capital markets.Comments (152)Jon RonsonJournalist, humorist, author and documentary filmmakerBecoming a psychopath-spotter can turn you a bit psychopathic because it compels you to start reducing people to items on a checklist -- to their maddest edges.Comments (226)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Yes, legislative deals require compromise. But why is it that deals over economic policy almost always compromise away what a majority of Americans want?Comments (426)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistI don\u0027t know about you, but I love when spring comes around and I can start thinking about all the fresh fruits and vegetables that are coming into season. Strawberries, artichokes, pineapples, avocados and asparagus are all in season right now and ready to take center stage on the table.Comments (29)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundFor years the NRA has actively fought against and prevented research on the causes and costs of gun violence. Why have we put up so long with efforts to block all research on a huge public health threat that injures and kills tens of thousands of Americans every year?Comments (187)Arianna HuffingtonThis week, Jon Ward puts the spotlight on John McCain and finds the longtime senator both pursuing new fights with characteristic grit and reflecting on his legacy. And Radley Balko writes about the increasing militarization of our police forces, as the American Civil Liberties Union is now looking into the ways police are using weapons that were once used only for war.Comments (13)Dylan RatiganNew York Times Best-Selling author and formerly the host of MSNBC\u0027s The Dylan Ratigan ShowCalifornians still do things their own way as if assistance from Washington would take too long to arrive. For a population that spends so little time looking outside for ways to do something, it is especially jarring when the scent of dysfunction blows in from the east.Comments (86)David WestinAuthor, \u0027Exit Interview\u0027; Former President, ABC NewsHere we were watching some of the best lawyers in the country arguing about whether the Constitution protects one of the most basic of human rights -- the right to marry -- at a time when people across the country are changing what they have to say about the sexual orientation of their fellow citizens.Comments (47)Dr. Maya RockeymooreFounder and President of Global Policy Solutions, the Center for Global Policy Solutions, and GlobalPolicy.tvBefore she decides to completely give up a career in public service, here are five things that Ashley Judd should know.Comments (204)Kristin ShawBlogger, TwoCannoli.comI will love you as my own daughter, if you will let me. If you\u0027re close to your mom, I am not going to try to replace her; you don\u0027t need two moms. You might, however, be interested in having a mother-in-law who might be a friend. All you have to do is ask.Comments (70)Christopher MerrillDirector, International Writing Program, University of IowaOur decentralized culture, soul-making that depends more on the private sector than government, will not fly everywhere. Think China or Russia. Better to pass along the fruits of our tradition of innovation in the arts, to explain the philosophies and practices in which such creativity can grow and thrive.CommentsLaura CococciaEditor, \u0027The Journal of Cultural Conversation\u0027Whether or not psychopathy is a valid category of mental illness doesn\u0027t have much of a bearing on how fascinating our desire to categorize psychopaths is as a cultural tendency.Comments (13)Colleen CrinionActivistEven dry British economists are talking about it. It feels like it\u0027s been everywhere lately -- even the Supreme Court. Marriage rates: just in a slump, or do we need to talk?Comments (66)Jacob CombsEditor, EqualityOnTrial.comAfter the whirlwind that has been the last week at the Supreme Court, it\u0027s hard to point to any outcome as more likely than another. Here\u0027s a brief look at the possible outcomes available to the Court in each case.Comments (18)Larry StraussVeteran high school English teacher, basketball coach, novelistIn the mid-1990s, the school district I work for informed all the high schools that they were no longer allowed to teach basic math. Math teachers who challenged the ruling were told that they were expressing a racist point of view.Comments (57)Eli LehrerPresident, R StreetVirginia Governor Bob McDonnell is exactly the sort of candidate -- an appealing, conservative pragmatist who knows how to govern -- that the Republican Party needs if it wants to win elections.CommentsCarolyn GregoireAssociate Lifestyles EditorAdmittedly, I still have a long way to go in tackling the more deep-seated anxieties and insecurities that often cause me stress. But I am slowly beginning to let go of some of the \"small stuff\" that cause me anxiety.Comments (17)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorYou often hear progressives bemoaning the massive war chests of the right-wing funders. But a common mistake made by the left is not adequately focusing on cultivating their own likeminded super-rich.Comments (43)Suzan Haskins and Dan PrescherInternationalLiving.com EditorsThe point is that in many cases, \u0027offshore\u0027 isn\u0027t about banking and secrecy... it\u0027s really about internationalizing your life. It\u0027s about taking the best possible advantage of perfectly legal opportunities and structures in other countries that allow you live a better quality of life for less money.Comments (13)David PaulPresident, Fiscal Strategies GroupFor the first time in decades -- perhaps since his father denounced Ronald Reagan\u0027s voodoo economics in the 1980 primaries -- the old Republican playbook has run its course. In the chaos of today\u0027s GOP, Jeb Bush can actually write his own script.Comments (132)Alexis Abramson, Ph.D.Leading expert for the 50+, Baby Boomers, Caregivers and Mature Adults, www.alexisabramson.comMany years ago your mom or dad probably had \u0027the talk\u0027 with you.

Now, as the adult child of an aging parent, you may find the tables have turned,Comments (52)Craig KanalleySenior Editor, Big News \u0026 Live Events, The Huffington PostTo start, Facebook is rolling the feature out to Pages, and that makes sense, as Pages often get the most engagement. It remains to be seen how useful the functionality would be for regular profiles.Comments (11)Kim SimonMother, Wife, Blogger, mamabythebay.comWhen I wrote \"What All Mothers Must Do For Their Sons,\" it was not the first story that I intended to write for you. It was the second. The first? It was Dear Jane Doe, me too.Comments (27)Lincoln MitchellHarriman Institute, Columbia UniversityJustice Roberts has demonstrated that he understands that as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court he has a responsibility not just to his own ideological views, and interpretation of the constitution, but to the institution of the Court as well.CommentsAmira YoungWriter, La Divorcee VitaWhen I left my husband, nothing could prepare me for what I faced next: nasty rumors, money issues, a vengeful ex, romantic feelings for someone I did not expect and an overwhelming sense of grief.Comments (21)Evelyn LeopoldVeteran journalist reporting from the United NationsAfter years of efforts to curb the $70 billion conventional arms trade, a global treaty was blocked by Iran, North Korea and Syria. But the measure is expected to go to the U.N. General Assembly where it may be resurrected.Comments (12)Jonathan AppelAssociate Professor of Psychology and Criminal Justice, Tiffin UniversityThere has been a supposed attempt in the soon to be published DSM-5 to move beyond the system of putting people into categorical boxes (e.g. psychopathic or not).Comments (17)Tom EngelhardtEditor, TomDispatch.comThese examples only begin to suggest the plethora of blood-soaked little anniversaries that Americans could observe, if they cared to, from a decade-plus of the former Global War on Terror that now has no name, but goes on no less intensely.Comments (77)Christopher ElliottAuthor, Scammed: How to Save Your Money and Find Better Service in a World of Schemes, Swindles and Shady DealsPut differently, the entire display was for show. The TSA could have detonated grenades, set up an archery range, even set off a small nuclear weapon -- it would have been just as meaningful. Or meaningless.Comments (13)Michele SimonPublic health lawyerA provision snuck into the budget bill passed last week in Congress upends our political system.
