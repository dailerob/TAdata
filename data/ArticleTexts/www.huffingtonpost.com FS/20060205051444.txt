{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AFP/Louai BesharaAPAPFor proof that all TV journalists covering politics should be forced to live as far away from the Beltway as possible, check out Chris Matthews\u0027 chummy on-air chat with former Commerce Secretary Don Evans. \"It\u0027s great having you on, Mr. Secretary,\" chirped Matthews. \"You\u0027re one of the good guys... We wish you were back in Washington because you\u0027re a very civil guy and you\u0027re bipartisan and everybody likes you.\" Wait a minute, what makes somebody \"one of the good guys\"? Being civil and charming -- and disastrous policies be damned? And what makes somebody \"bipartisan\"? Being a Bush apologist who got his job in the cabinet by raising $90 million for W\u0027s 2000 run?READ POST | comments (163)02.04.2006 Martin GarbusThe Democratic Senators are now exercised by the possibility that Bush will appoint his own man to take over the investigation.

He needs help --- and to get it, I fear, he must leave his show.READ POST | comments (136)02.04.2006 Gary HartIt is totally outrageous for Karl Rove to condemn Democrats (too many of whom voted to invade Iraq.)
