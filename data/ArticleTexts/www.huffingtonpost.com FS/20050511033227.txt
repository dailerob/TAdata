{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AriannaWelcome to Day Two of the Huffington Post. More of the top news stories as they break. And an abundance of riches on our group blog. While our team is still trying to figure out who won -- or lost -- our launch sleep deprivation pool, Gary Hart is raising the most important long-term question on Iraq: are we there to promote democracy or are we there to stay? Joe Scarborough follows up on Jon Corzine’s post on Sudan. And Larry Gelbart recovers from a bad case of bulmedia (reading and watching so much of it you start throwing up). And be sure to catch Jim Pinkerton, Byron York, Dal LaMagna, David Sirota, Cable Neuhaus, Marshall Herskovitz, Kevin Hassett, Jay Gordon, Jim Lampley and John Robin Baitz on The Blog.05.10.2005 David ReesI stopped by the Carnegie Council this morning and asked if Larry David was ready to read my screenplay--AS I HAD BEEN PROMISED.Guess what Arianna? You were mistaken: Larry David doesn’t work at the Carnegie Council.So my screenplay remains unread. (It’s called \"Heritage Foundation’s Ultimate Energy Policy Adventure\": Think \"Revenge of the Nerds\" meets \"a bunch of bullshit underwritten by ExxonMobil.\")An unread screenplay? For this I agreed to blog?Read whole post.Author Bio | permalink05.10.2005 Rep. John ConyersThere is nothing more important than being frank with the American people about going to war -- so this goes to the core of our democratic values.Read whole post.Author Bio | permalink05.10.2005 Adam McKayI recently went to the Talladega 500 race in Alabama for a film scout. The entire time I was there, my friends and I joked about yelling \"I love Howard Dean!\" or \"Noam Chomsky rules!\" Without exaggeration the crowd would have ripped us apart and passed our torsos around over their heads like a beach ball at an REO Speedwagon concert.Read whole post.Author Bio | permalink05.10.2005 Quincy JonesThat new Elvis movie got me to thinking about fame and massive success and about how some people can handle it -- and how for others it can be the most destructive thing in the world. It got me to thinking about Michael -- and how difficult it is to watch what’s going on with him now.Read whole post.permalink05.10.2005 John FundSocial Security reform dead? Perhaps not. Here is a proposal that stops the \"raids\" of the Social Security surpluses and creates a personal lockbox for every American who wants one, and guarantees lower-income workers get a pension that lifts them above the poverty line, All without diverting a penny from Social Security payroll taxes into \"risky\" investments. Will opponents of reform at least give this idea a fair hearing?Author Bio | permalink05.10.2005 Joe ScarboroughAmnesty International was so concerned about the two million Sudanese victims that they did, well, nothing.Read whole post.Author Bio | permalink05.10.2005 Bill MaherBiodiesel is renewable, biodegradable and nontoxic. If you own a diesel-burning car or truck, you can actually take the excess oils from a fast food grill, remove the severed fingers, and use it to fill your tank.Read whole post.permalink05.10.2005 Gary HartAre we, or are we not, building permanent military bases in Iraq?

The system breaks down, however, when the press fails to provide such information.Read whole post.Author Bio | permalink05.10.2005 Danielle CrittendenMaybe it is futile to hope that we can ever bridge the gap between Powertown and Tinseltown so long as the Republicans are in power. But if that day ever comes, perhaps it will go -- or should go something like this...Read whole post.Author Bio | permalink05.09.2005 Andy SternUntil Democrats stand up for rewarding work and respecting workers facing huge challenges in a global economy, they will stand in the minority of the American political landscape.Read whole post.Author Bio | permalink05.09.2005 Jerry BrownIs it a post-modern nightmare or Dante\u0027s Inferno?Read whole post.Author Bio | permalink05.09.2005 Larry DavidI know this may not sound politically correct, but as someone who has abused and tormented employees and underlings for years, I am dismayed by all of this yammering directed at John Bolton.Read whole post.permalink05.09.2005 Walter CronkiteThe Democratic Party should organize a convention this year to debate and resolve a platform that would provide the confused electorate some idea of what the party stands for…a regretfully missing ingredient in the politics of the moment.Read whole post.permalink05.10.2005 Harry ShearerI was in an airport hotel room early this week, early in the morning, stumbling about looking for the toothbrush, the toilet, the time, when I clicked on the TV, hoping some news would jar me to wakefulness. And there, on CNN, was the sunnily sultry face of Soledad O\u0027Brien, begging me to stay tuned for an upcoming story about a dog, or a diet, or a dieting dog. I told you it was early.And I started thinking about the real heroes of cable and network news: the guys and gals who\u0027ve come in by the droves recently from the world of local TV news, where, you might say, the rubbers meet the road. These people have done yeoman--and yeowoman--work in bringing human interest to the once-staid face of network and cable news, and where human interest comes, ratings surely follow, although you can\u0027t tell that from the recent network news ratings. But surely that\u0027s just a five- or ten-year anomaly?The noble work, however, is not yet finished. There are days or nights when a body count in Iraq--who knew that was still going on?--or a fight over some Social Security nonsense--interferes with the average adult\u0027s healthy news...Read whole post.Posted at 04:55 PM | permalink","h1":"",".title":"","h2":"On The Blog NowWHEN DO I GET TO MEET GWYNETH PALTROW???Creating Justifications to Go to WarIn Junior We TrustGod Will Walk Out of the RoomBreaking the Social Security LogjamSudan Suffering in SilenceBio-Delicious!IRAQ: Exit or Empire?BulmediaIRAQ: It\u0027s Not About UsWhere Have You Gone Woodward \u0026 Bernstein?D.C. vs. HollywoodAre Democrats Still the Party of the Working Man?Democracy in the Electronic WastelandWhy I Support John BoltonDemocrats: What Do They Stand For?Keepin It Real","h3":"Grenade \u0027Thrown at Bush\u0027 in GeorgiaKing Tut RevealedGallup: Americans Think Congress Doing Bad Job, See Ethics ProblemsConservatives to Rally around DelayFrist Plans to Use \u0027Nuclear Option\u0027 on Nomination of OwenFox News \u0027Fair and Balanced\u0027 in Social Security CoverageFor Advertisers: Over 50 and Out of FavorReal Wages Fall at Fastest Rate in 14 YearsYahoo unveils online music serviceDefiant Iran plans Nuclear RevivalKing of Jordan to Pardon Iraq\u0027s Deputy PM over $300m Bank FraudSwiss Resort Covers Part of its Glacier to Avoid Melt from Global WarmingMaher Pitches Prez: Go BioDieselAmnesty International Slams Country\u0027s Human Rights RecordZimbabwe Re-Elected to UN Human Rights CommissionHUFFINGTON POST EXCLUSIVE: EMBARGOED BOOK CLAIMS SAUDI OIL INFRASTRUCTURE RIGGED FOR CATASTROPHIC SELF-DESTRUCTION",".snippet":"","h4":"Terrorism Expert Daniel Pipes RespondsMilitary Strategist Brian Haig Responds","h5":"","h6":"Huff Post Updates:","tr":"Apr MAY JUN 11 2004 2005 2006 31,359 captures 22 Apr 05 - 2 Sep 16 Close HelpApr MAY JUN 11 2004 2005 2006Apr MAY JUN112004 2005 200631,359 captures 22 Apr 05 - 2 Sep 16Grenade \u0027Thrown at Bush\u0027 in Georgia in brief | comments King Tut Revealed in brief | comments Huff Post Updates: Gallup: Americans Think Congress Doing Bad Job, See Ethics Problems in brief | comments Conservatives to Rally around Delay in brief | comments Frist Plans to Use \u0027Nuclear Option\u0027 on Nomination of Owen in brief | comments Fox News \u0027Fair and Balanced\u0027 in Social Security Coverage in brief | comments For Advertisers: Over 50 and Out of Favor in brief | comments Contact the Huffington Post with scoops, and firsthand accounts at: AOL Instant Messenger: HuffPost.
