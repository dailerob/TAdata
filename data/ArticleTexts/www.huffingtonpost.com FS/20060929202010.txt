{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"APFrom AP/enmu.eduFrom thinkprogress.comFrom AP and rawstory.comThis summer, President Bush said: \"When 12 million Iraqis went to the polls and said, \u0027I want to be free,\u0027 it was an amazing moment.\" Well, we\u0027ve just had another amazing moment in which the Iraqi people have spoken. But this time the message isn\u0027t \"We want to be free.\" It\u0027s \"We don\u0027t mind seeing American soldiers blown up.\" You read that right. In a stunning new poll, over 60 percent of Iraqis said they approve of attacks on U.S. troops. U.S. deaths in Iraq just passed 2,700 and the Iraqi people seem to be dancing on the graves. Large numbers of those voters who held up their purple-stained fingers back in December now seem intent on giving America the finger.READ POST | comments (74)09.29.2006 Harry ShearerWhat can the political motivation be for the British leak--unless it\u0027s the increasing frustration of those in the military with the policy they\u0027re being ordered to carry out?READ POST | comments09.29.2006 Dave JohnsonSo... just HOW dishonest is Bush?
