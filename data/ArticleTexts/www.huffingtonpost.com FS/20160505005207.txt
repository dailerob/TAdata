{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"On Tuesday, the musical Hamilton was nominated for a record 16 Tony awards. And three weeks ago, its creator and star, Lin-Manuel Miranda, won the Pulitzer Prize. And it\u0027s all, of course, richly deserved. But one angle of the saga of Hamilton, both on-stage and off, that has not been commented on is how it shows the value of time off. Alexander Hamilton wasn\u0027t just the subject of our country\u0027s first sex scandal. He was perhaps also our first fully documented case -- and the founding father -- of political burnout. And one of the biggest takeaways from the musical, for me, is this question: If the hard-driving Hamilton had given himself the time he needed to recharge, how much better -- and longer -- would he have been able to serve the adopted country he loved so much?What happens next will test the character for all of us - Republican, Democrat, and Independent. It will determine whether we move forward as one nation or splinter at the hands of one man\u0027s narcissism and divisiveness.Democratic Senator from MassachusettsHappy first day of a half year of living with the possibility (however remote we have to believe it to be in order to stay sane) that Donald Trump - this crass and crude boor, this bloodthirsty psychopath, this Brobdingnagian narcissist, this proudly misogynistic ignoramus, this pus-filled boil of hate, this odious short-fingered vulgarian - could be the 45th President of the United States.Paul Slansky is amassing a memory for Americans allergic to accountability and addicted to amnesia.Shockingly –- given his outrageous, race-baiting and even violence-tinged rhetoric –- Trump is not that far behind in the horse race as the “fall” campaign informally begins. Nor does the Electoral College map look that impossible for him.Global Editorial DirectorNow that Governor Kasich is suspending his campaign, will the party come together and enthusiastically support its standard-barer?Hofstra Journalism ProfessorThe racists and bigots of America have always been out there. There have always been hideous trolls on the Internet. But now they are emboldened in a big way by the bellicose Donald Trump. He\u0027s opened Pandora\u0027s box, and nobody can shut it.Writer, editor, self-styled political pundit, and former ABC News journalistAre we seriously asking why young people don\u0027t like the contrived politicians who are awash in donor money, privilege, and connections? That\u0027s obvious. What\u0027s not obvious is how older generations got so used to that pulp.Host, \u0027The Young Turks\u0027It is now official. Seventeen candidates ran for the Republican presidential nomination, and the sixteenth of these just suspended his campaign. This leaves Donald Trump as the last man standing.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comIn today\u0027s climate of renewed economic anxiety, many are prompted to jettison this tradition of pragmatic liberal education. In search of short cuts to vocational success, they undermine students\u0027 ability to respond to changes in the economy by preparing them only for what is valued right now.President, Wesleyan UniversityPrejudice\u0027s real roots are far less immediately accessible than we think they are, so it\u0027s time to stop having such brash reactions to injustice and start having deep, elevated conversations about it.Founder and CEO of NeuroBusiness Group. Part-time assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.Today in the United States, racial economic inequality persists because of the failure of will to invest in people of color, who continue to pay the price for a 21st century economy built off of the white supremacy of the 19th and 20th centuries. ItDirector of the Racial Wealth Divide Initiative and Host of the Race and Wealth podcast of CFEDIt\u0027s tempting for everyone else to feel morally superior to the oligarchs sucking us dry. But the truth is, the negative psychological traits that come with having money exist to a degree in the middle class too.Blogs Editor, Huffington PostOften we are acknowledged for mothering our living children and not for how we mother our children who have passed.Wife, mother to one on earth and three she carries in her heart, artist, student, writer, and founder of Luminous Light Studio.Wildlife trafficking is a global problem, with implications that extend far beyond the populations of animals killed for their hair, hides, teeth, and horns. If we\u0027re going to be successful in stemming this epidemic, the United States must play a leading role in eliminating our own demand for illegal products.Secretary of the InteriorChairman, Tiffany \u0026 Co.To the surprise of many, the pop star is still standing and riding a streak of three straight #1 hits.Politics and culture writerIt may seem odd to picture the demise of the flagship brand of the world\u0027s largest beer company. But Anheuser-Busch - the U.S.-based unit of AB InBev - is following in the footsteps that led to the irrelevance of a host of other once-dominant companies - Eastman Kodak, Woolworth\u0027s Department Stores, Bethlehem Steel and Blockbuster Video, to name a few.Independent source of news and analysis, from the academic and research community.\"Still grading?\" I asked my colleague, a professor at a Georgia college, as she carefully viewed her laptop a few weeks ago. \"I\u0027m finished with that,\" she told me. \"Now I\u0027m pricing bulletproof vests.\" She had good reason to do so.Political science professor, LaGrange College in GeorgiaThe U.S. government has given small amounts of money to address the human victims of Agent Orange/dioxin. Much of the money has not reached the Agent Orange victims who need it so much, and the amounts allocated cannot make much of a dent in addressing the tremendous human suffering.Professor, Thomas Jefferson School of LawWebster\u0027s Dictionary defines decoupling as \"eliminating the interrelationship\" between two processes. But the interrelationship between CO2 emissions and economic growth has certainly not been eliminated.Director of the Harvard Environmental Economics ProgramConcerns over the potential for terrorist groups to obtain MANPADS from U.S.-supplied insurgents have been greatly heightened by incidents in which terrorist groups captured U.S.-supplied weaponry in Syria.Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicyThe thing about adulthood that I never understood until now was the mind-numbing monotony of it all. The grown-up life I fantasized about when I was a child did not include things like buying tires for the car or re-caulking the tub or rolling the garbage cans down to the curb in the pouring rain. You can\u0027t escape adulthood; it\u0027s everywhere.Writer + photographerFor all those with Malias in their lives or, perhaps more importantly, those who can\u0027t do a year like this, let\u0027s stop calling it a \"gap year\" once and for all. It belittles the work students put into these years of their lives and it marginalizes those without the privileges to be able to work for a year for less than a living wage.Grad school student (social work and international development), activist, artist, interfaith leader.No, your whining about religious persecution because you have to bake a cake for a gay wedding doesn\u0027t make you the Martin Luther King, Jr. of a new conservative religious civil rights movement.Author; Editor; Speaker; ActivistSuch discourse may be unpleasant and off-putting, but campus community members should use their own voices to respond, not call for disciplinary action and the silencing of others.Director of Policy Reform, Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE)As you read this, chances are you\u0027ve already used one today. Lightweight, durable, and convenient, plastic bags have become a staple of commerce -- so ubiquitous that most cashiers and shopkeepers usually don\u0027t even ask if you really need one.New York City Public AdvocateMigratory monarch butterflies, which flock to the mountains of central Mexico every winter, are severely endangered because of herbicides, extreme weather and climate change. Now, a Mexican mining company with a terrible environmental record plans to reopen a mine in the heart of a protected monarch reserve.Mexican poet and environmentalistSenator Cruz, it was frightening for a conductor to see what happened in your misjudged pregnant pauses. What works from the pulpit and the orchestra pit does not always work on the stump.American conductor, educator, and producerAll we know for sure is that Ted Cruz dropping out of the Republican race has changed the Democratic race almost as profoundly as the Republican one.Assistant Professor of English at University of New Hampshire; Series Co-Editor, Best American Experimental Writing\"It was like when they broadcast \u0027The War of The Worlds\u0027\" explained Ernie Butler of Edmonton, \"The prospect of Cruz wrapping his tentacles around the weakest among us is too much to bear,\" said Butler as he scampered into the darkness clutching a sleeping bag and sack of hastily-made sandwiches.CEO, Goodyear Satire Co.What\u0027s clear is that strong animal cruelty laws and dedicated enforcement go hand in hand with the elevation of public attitudes about the seriousness of these crimes. Each inspires and activates the other, and both are necessary to effectively tackle this problem.ASPCA President and CEOOne role of a manager is to lead, and it\u0027s difficult to lead cultural transformation if managers are not willing to talk about some of the real blocks to building a sustainable, profitable organization. Change will not happen overnight. These types of behavioral shifts take time to interrupt, and can only happen one behavior, one authentic conversation at a time.Founder of Simple Intentions, author and expert at disrupting patterns that cause imbalance.Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
