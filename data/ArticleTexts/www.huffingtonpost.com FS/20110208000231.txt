{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"When Kenny Lerer and I co-founded The Huffington Post in May 2005, we had high hopes. But even we would have been hard put to predict that less than six years later we would be able to announce a deal that now makes it possible for us to execute our vision at light speed. AOL is an online pioneer that engenders great trust among its 250 million global users. HuffPost is on the cutting edge of creating news that is social and brings with it a distinctive voice and a highly engaged audience. In this case, 1 + 1 \u003d 11. Far from changing our editorial approach, our culture, or our mission, this moment will be, for HuffPost, like stepping off a fast-moving train and onto a supersonic jet. We\u0027re still traveling toward the same destination, with the same people at the wheel, and with the same goals, but we\u0027re now going to get there much, much faster.Read Post | CommentsHoward Fineman, 02.07.2011If the 21st century is about \"self-determination\" -- and I think it is -- then we all need to be actively informed and engaged. Journalism has become an interactive, communal exercise in self-education.Read Post | CommentsJason Linkins, 02.07.2011Editor, Eat the PressMy favorite part of the celebration of Reagan\u0027s 100th birthday was a Politico op-ed by Rep. Ben Quayle, in which the Arizona Republican strongly advances the argument that he has some fuzzy memories of the \u002780s.Read Post | CommentsDean Baker, 02.07.2011Co-Director of the Center for Economic and Policy ResearchThe right uses government all the time to advance its interest by setting rules that redistribute income upward. As long as progressives ignore these rules, they will be left fighting over crumbs.Read Post | CommentsLaurie David and Susan Stiffelman, 02.07.2011If we encourage yet more activities that involve staring at a screen, we\u0027ll be depriving our youngsters with essential ingredients that are vital to being human.Read Post | CommentsSteve Clemons, 02.07.2011Publisher of \"The Washington Note\"I wish Jane Harman well and congratulate her on her new post at the Wilson Center -- but I think it\u0027s also fair to lament some fronts where the nation will be worse off for her departure.Read Post | CommentsGraham E. Fuller, 02.07.2011Former CIA station chief in Kabul; Author \u0027The Future of Political Islam\u0027America cannot go on riding the tiger forever in the Middle East. We cannot expect to have \"pro-American\" forces in power in the Middle East when the publics don\u0027t like our policies. We cannot continue our endless interventions.Read Post | CommentsNick Gillespie and Veronique de Rugy, 02.07.2011Senator Rand Paul\u0027s new budget plan cuts $500 billion from the federal budget this year. Paul proposes cutting defense spending by 6.5 percent, saving $47 billion. But will his fellow Republicans go along?Read Post | CommentsKaty Hall, 02.07.2011Entertainment Editor, Huffington PostCianfrance accelerated the relationship\u0027s corrosion by starting off-screen fights between his actors. One night he told Gosling to go into Williams\u0027 bedroom and try to make love to her.Read Post | CommentsRobert Kuttner, 02.06.2011Co-founder and co-editor of The American ProspectAmerica now has about 25 million people either out of work or underemployed. Meanwhile, corporate profits continue to set records. What\u0027s going on?Read Post | CommentsRep. Dennis Kucinich, 02.07.2011U.S. House RepresentativeThe 112th Congress began with a historic reading of the U.S. Constitution. Will anyone subscribe to the First and Fourth Amendments tomorrow when the PATRIOT Act is up for a vote?Read Post | CommentsRep. Mike Honda, 02.07.2011Represents the 15th Congressional District of California in the U.S. HousePolicies that favor scaling up domestically, as opposed to overseas, are essential to ensuring that American ingenuity generates U.S. jobs -- not just a high Dow Jones Industrial Average.Read Post | CommentsNina Burleigh, 02.05.2011Next book: The Fatal Gift of Beauty, about the Italian trial of Amanda KnoxWhatever happens in Egypt, there\u0027s an elephant in the room, and it\u0027s pink. Freedom of women is what the Al Qaeda jihadis, as much as the Muslim Brothers in Egypt, most revile about the West.Read Post | CommentsTom Krattenmaker, 02.07.2011Author, \u0027Onward Christian Athletes\u0027All this fast-and-loose talk about \"redemption\" ought to be tempered with a little clarity lest we completely trivialize a concept with deep religious and philosophical meaning.Read Post | CommentsThomas Ferguson, 02.07.2011Roosevelt Institute Fellow and Political Science Professor, U Mass, BostonA foreign exchange crisis lies immediately ahead, as food prices keep rising. If the security police or the army turns Cairo\u0027s streets and squares into the Valley of the Dead, the harm to both Egypt and U.S. interests will be incalculable.Read Post | CommentsRobert Greenwald and Derrick Crowe, 02.07.2011Producer, director, political activistHad the U.S. adopted a more nuanced approach in distinguishing Taliban from al Qaeda, we might not be facing the insurgency that\u0027s continuing its march across Afghanistan.Read Post | CommentsPearl Korn, 02.07.2011Advocate for Improved Medicare For AllThe American people need not be sacrificed as the cost of promoting corporate growth. Both can coexist. It is time to seek a balance, Mr. President.Read Post | CommentsTom Engelhardt, 02.07.2011Editor of TomDispatch.comThe administration has been shaken. Officials are undoubtedly worried about a domestic political future in which the question could be -- who lost the Middle East? Like the Cheshire Cat\u0027s grin, only the rhetoric of the last decades seems to be left.Read Post | CommentsAn Xiao Mina, 02.07.2011Artist, designer, international ubernerdIt\u0027s not fair to compare two train systems of vastly different ages with vastly different histories and needs, but no one ever said life would be fair. So let\u0027s see how they measure up.Read Post | CommentsShereen El Feki, 02.07.2011Writer, broadcaster and academicTo those who know Egypt, the uprising was both inevitable and unimaginable. In just over a week, youth have gone from being layabouts to leaders. My friend A. often fretted about her son\u0027s lack of maturity. Not anymore, though.Read Post | CommentsMichael Brenner, 02.07.2011Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghIt is the instinct of rulers to greedily take credit for any success and to shed responsibility for any failure. Barack Obama has perfected this art form with the events in Egypt.Read Post | CommentsSteven Weber, 02.07.2011Actor, wise-assThe fact that Obama sat down with one of the least credible media personalities in the history of the presidential interview is the very picture of appeasement.Read Post | CommentsDan Collins, 02.07.2011New York Editor-At-Large of The Huffington PostIt\u0027s the end of another beautiful -- or at least mutually self-interested -- political friendship. National teachers union head Randi Weingarten has lost the love when it comes to Mayor Bloomberg.Read Post | CommentsTerry Newell, 02.06.2011Founder, Leadership for a Responsible SocietyIf we wish to remember President Reagan on his 100th birthday, we could do no better than to recall that he did what he felt was right for America, even if that meant angering some in his own party.Read Post | CommentsAndrew Zimmern, 02.06.2011Chef, writer, host of Travel Channel\u0027s \u0027Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern\u0027Ten thousand miles from my home I find myself confronted with an inner monologue I thought I would never find: would I eat human flesh?
