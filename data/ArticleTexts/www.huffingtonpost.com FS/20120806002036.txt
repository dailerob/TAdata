{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, America, on its journey down the path toward a more perfect union, continued its prolonged pit-stop at Chick-fil-A. The meal consisted of an overheated \"appreciation day\" for the fast-food chain, cooked up by Mike Huckabee, and a bitter side order of attacking fat people. No one ever said civil rights wouldn\u0027t come with an occasional bout of national indigestion. In India, over 670 million people were thrown into darkness during the biggest blackout since Charlie Sheen\u0027s last drinking binge. On Wall Street, a rogue algorithm caused a trading spree that wreaked havoc and gave America\u0027s stock markets yet another black eye. Meanwhile, Olympic fever momentarily broke with news that eight badminton players had been disqualified for intentionally losing their matches. All across America, sports fans reacted with disbelief, amazed that badminton is actually an Olympic sport. Lastly, we mourned the passing of a legendary writer and provocateur. RIP Gore Vidal.Read Post | Comments (37)David Bromwich, 08/01/12Professor of Literature at YaleFor Mitt Romney, as for the billionaires he had in tow on his Israel trip, the personal is political.

El-Erian, 08/03/12CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOFor the improvement in the labor market to continue, America needs to minimize the risk of derailment by three clear and present dangers: the reluctance of Congress to deal with the fiscal cliff, Europe\u0027s inability to get ahead of its crisis, and a possible geopolitical shock emanating from Iran.Read Post | Comments (210)Arianna Huffington, 08/02/12Saturday night I was watching C-SPAN (isn\u0027t that what everybody does on Saturday nights?) and I saw an amazing thing -- a speech by Mitt Romney in which he was relaxed and natural, making jokes that weren\u0027t painfully awkward. Had I entered a different dimension?Read Post | Comments (600)Marian Wright Edelman, 08/03/12President, Children\u0027s Defense FundWhen we look at the state of our union and the state of America\u0027s children in 2012, it\u0027s impossible to deny that our nation\u0027s economy, professed values of equal opportunity, future, and soul are all in danger right now.Read Post | Comments (160)Noah Michelson, 08/02/12Editor, HuffPost Gay VoicesThe next time someone says to you \"This is a First Amendment issue\" or \"Chick-fil-A isn\u0027t anti-gay, it\u0027s just pro-traditional marriage,\" send them a link to one of the heartbreaking stories we feature on Gay Voices on a daily basis.Read Post | Comments (5,055)Lopez Lomong, 07/30/12Olympic Runner, Team USAYes, I think of winning Olympic gold, representing the USA and expressing my appreciation for all that this country has given to me in blessing upon overwhelming blessing.Read Post | Comments (39)Gov.

What\u0027s happening is that women are getting more choices and more confidence to make those choices. What\u0027s happening is the decline of expectations, long and slow though it may be.Read Post | Comments (439)Valerie Jarrett, 08/01/12Senior Advisor and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsUnder the Affordable Care Act, for the first time ever, women will now have access to life-saving preventive care, such as mammograms and contraception, without paying any more out of their own pockets.

Little is heard respecting the right to remain silent. But many more Americans remain silent than speak, for more reasons than we can count.

Mitt Romney is not just barely tolerated but is roundly despised by many of the people whose job it is to sell him.Read Post | Comments (772)Marlo Thomas, 07/27/12Award-winning actress, author, and activistI continue to be inspired by those who venture into the unknown, fight back against their fears, and don\u0027t spend an ounce of thought on how someone else might be judging them.

Kathleen Sebelius, 07/31/12Secretary of Health and Human ServicesWomen\u0027s health decisions shouldn\u0027t be made by politicians or insurance companies.
