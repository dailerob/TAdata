{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027As a practical matter Obamacare is the sort of hodgepodge that no one in their right mind would put into place if they were designing a health care system from scratch. Certainly a universal Medicare system, similar to the one in Canada, would be far more fair and efficient. Since this was not a plausible political reach in 2010, many progressives hoped that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) would at least include the public option that President Obama had touted during his campaign. Whether or not a public option was an obtainable goal, Obama was not prepared to spend the political capital to try to get it included. This left us with a law that leaves us far short of universal coverage and requires people to get private insurance or pay a fine. That\u0027s not a pretty sight, but we shouldn\u0027t let this prevent us from recognizing the extent to which the ACA still presents an enormous step forward.Comments (246)Peter SchuckLaw Professor, Yale; Author, \u0027Why Government Fails So Often, and How It Can Do Better\u0027The White House\u0027s decision to suspend enforcement of Obamacare\u0027s health insurance standards because of the website debacle was politically wise. But the main lesson we should draw from this incident is not that government can quickly change course in the face of failure.CommentsTom FlemingFictional patriarch of T-Mobile’s Catch Jeremy PromotionOur son, Jeremy, isn\u0027t a big rap star or an angry politician, so I know you probably won\u0027t be interested in our story. But please, hear me out. We truly need your help.CommentsGeorge Stevens, Jr.Award-winning writer, director, producer and founder of the American Film InstituteWe made Years of Lightning, Day of Drums so the world might see and remember what we knew in those days. And now the larger reward is that the film survives so this and future generations may hear the soaring voice and view the vibrant likeness of the man who offered such singular inspiration half a century ago.CommentsOlivia ColePoet, author, and activistEvery day we are bombarded with movies and television shows in which white families are plugged as the \"default\" experience... and no one would say that these films are about race. What USAToday\u0027s tweet reveals is that white audiences are unable to see black people as beings separate from their blackness.Comments (242)David TrumbleAward-winning artist, cartoonist and illustratorComments (128)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarFilms are getting more violent -- more than twice as violent as they were in 1950. That\u0027s perhaps no surprise. But new evidence has revealed that the most violent films are actually the ones aimed right at kids.Comments (11)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorHis is the classic example of the adage that if you\u0027ve got a reputation for being an early riser, you can sleep til noon. What are his accomplishments?Comments (16)Kelly M. FlanaganClinical Psychologist, Writer, BloggerOur families are where we first learn how to say \"No\" in a safe, supportive environment. If we don\u0027t learn to do so there, we won\u0027t learn to do so anywhere. If our children can\u0027t say \"No\" to us, they won\u0027t say it to anyone.CommentsNoah MichelsonEditor, HuffPost Gay VoicesSeeing as I have some practical experience here, I\u0027d like to clear up a few things for those (presumably) non-c*cksucking straight men and anyone else who might be confused by these terms and/or when they can and should be used.Comments (573)Justin LeeAuthor, \u0027TORN: Rescuing the Gospel from the Gays-vs.-Christians Debate\u0027If there\u0027s nothing I can say to convince you to tip well, then at least do me this one favor: Don\u0027t go out to eat after church, don\u0027t pray before your meal, and don\u0027t sign your receipt with the word \"pastor.\" In short, don\u0027t let people know you\u0027re a Christian.Comments (1,489)Wendell PotterAuthor, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgIf you relied on the Washington media for your news and information about health care, you\u0027d think that insurance companies would never have considered sending policy discontinuation notices to their policyholders until forced to do so by Obamacare.Comments (1,381)James ClearEntrepreneur, weightlifter, and travel photographerThere are choices that you make every day, some of which seem completely unrelated to your health and happiness, that dramatically impact the way you feel mentally and physically.Comments (98)Larry MagidTechnology journalist\"Goodness\" can be infectious. We keep hearing about an epidemic of cyberbullying (actually there isn\u0027t one), but we\u0027d much rather be talking about an epidemic of kindness because that\u0027s exactly what is happening right now.CommentsMatt Damon and Gary WhiteWater plays a central role in all aspects of life, from energy to food security, health and education. That is what makes it so complex to tackle. As water scarcity becomes all too real, collaboration will become essentialCommentsBob CescaManaging Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowRep. Michele Bachmann (R-MN) appeared on CNN and complained that she\u0027s going to lose her insurance because of Obamacare. Bachmann is clearly very frightened about the prospect, but it\u0027s mainly because she\u0027s totally confused about how exactly to sign up.Comments (263)Melanie NotkinFounder and national bestselling author of Savvy Auntie. Author, Otherhood, March 4, 2014,There are good dates, bad dates and forgettable dates. And there are dates that feel ethereal. They are rare, rarer than a much desired sun shower on desert-hot day. And sometimes, they last just that long, just long enough for us to remember a connection with someone can exist.Comments (63)Mark MansonEntrepreneur, author and world travelerIf I ask you, \"What do you want out of life?\" and you say something like, \"I want to be happy and have a great family and a job I like,\" it\u0027s so ubiquitous that it doesn\u0027t even mean anything. What\u0027s more interesting to me is what pain do you want?Comments (33)Deborah CastilloMember, Home Defenders LeagueSome in the media are crying out as if the big bankers were being persecuted within an inch of their lives. As much as they complain, not a single banker has gone to jail as a result of the mortgage debacle. But I did.CommentsJonathan KimGentleman farmer, film critic for ReThink Reviews and the Uprising ShowIs it possible that all the lessons of World War II have been learned and there are no new stories left to tell? And does this explain The Book Thief, which follows an orphaned girl in a World War II-era German village, feels so mawkish and unnecessary?CommentsJoe PeyronninHofstra Journalism ProfessorToday it is regarded as the most famous speech in American history. Yet, in the news coverage of the dedication of the Gettysburg National Cemetery, Lincoln\u0027s brief two-minute address was overshadowed by the two-hour speech given by Edward Everett, one of America\u0027s great orators.CommentsMadeleine DoddWrites ads for a living, articles because she\u0027s interested and short stories for funWe\u0027re not \u0027hot young talent\u0027, we\u0027re the most disposable, and once disposed of we\u0027ll probably have to work for free again. Britain\u0027s brutally uncertain jobs market is the perfect clammy breeding ground for a mid-twenties crisis.CommentsMeg Waite ClaytonBestselling Novelist, \u0027The Wednesday Sisters\u0027 and \u0027The Wednesday Daughters\u0027After I read in the New York Times that The Golden Notebook author Doris Lessing, who won the 2007 Nobel Prize for Literature, passed away, I turned to rereading some of her writings and interviews. I hope you\u0027ll enjoy these little wisdoms I\u0027ve collected.CommentsVivien Lesnik WeismanFilmmakerI am the first journalist with whom Mr. Hammond met since his arrest in March 2012. This interview was held months before sentencing. At the request of Mr. Hammond\u0027s attorneys, who feared his words would be used at sentencing against him, I delayed publishing.CommentsMark GoldringChief Executive, OxfamIn this year of multiple megadisasters, will the world scale up its humanitarian aid to respond to the Philippines, Syria, Congo and the countless other different crises? Or will it in 2013 fail the test it passed three years ago?CommentsMohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOCEOs and other leaders, in the corporate world and beyond, should do more than follow the news on the Affordable Care Act (ACA or Obamacare). They should also ask themselves what they would do if they were in President Obama\u0027a shoes.Comments (32)Sue KerrFounder and editor, Pittsburgh Lesbian CorrespondentsI was stunned into silence the other night when we tuned in to the second episode of the season. In the first 15 minutes I counted a lesbian-prison-rape joke, a straight-men-perceived-as-gay joke, a Carl-kissed-a-trans-woman-ha-ha-ha joke, and a joke about said trans woman\u0027s genitals.Comments (71)Carly SchwartzDeputy National Editor, The Huffington PostGrowing up with a stay-at-home mom was something I took for granted as a kid and teenager. I could care less that she was the last person I saw before school started and the first person I talked to when it was over.Comments (42)Todd MillerWriter, \u0027Border Wars\u0027Militarized borders are becoming ever more common throughout the world, especially in areas of U.S. influence.CommentsLisa LongoPolitical activist and writerSome insurance companies are canceling policies, so therefore our president must have lied. Nope. Not true. It is a handy talking point for the opposition, but it is in fact, just another logical fallacy. Once you start listening for them, you\u0027ll find them everywhere.Comments (16)Jeffrey SachsDirector, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \"To Move the World: JFK\u0027s Quest for Peace\"Many progressives will no doubt say that I\u0027m being unfair to the Keynesians, and that they too would favor an investment strategy if the Republicans didn\u0027t block them. I hope that\u0027s true. Yet Keynesian stimulus repeatedly takes our eyes off the long term.Comments (92)Paul RieckhoffFounder, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of AmericaSurvivors have shown tremendous courage in telling their stories.
