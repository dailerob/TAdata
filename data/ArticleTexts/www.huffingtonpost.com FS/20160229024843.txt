{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week the nation had to clean up the collateral-mud-damage from watching Thursday\u0027s Republican debate. To call it a circus would be to insult the dignity, decorum and poise of the circus. \"This guy\u0027s a choke artist, and this guy is a liar,\" said Trump of Rubio and Cruz, who finally took on The Donald. Meanwhile -- irony alert! -- Trump said former Mexican President Vincente Fox \"used a filthy, disgusting word\" and \"should be ashamed.\" Even worse, the substance matched the atmosphere. After an extended debate on poll numbers, it was hard not to wonder how much better it would be if the candidates cared about meaningful data as much as poll data: like the new report that the seas are rising at their fastest rate in 28 centuries. Or that 22 million people would lose healthcare with Obamacare\u0027s repeal. Or that deporting 11 million people would cost an estimated $400 - $600 billion, take 20 years and lower real GDP by $1.6 trillion. But, of course, facts are for losers.These stories of people from China, Somalia, Mali, Sudan, and Tunisia -- testaments to the impact, importance and diversity of global cinema -- have been smothered in the U.S. by the volume of attention given to five words of mine at an opening press conference, which is too bad.Actress and activistFor billions of families around the world, the challenges of energy and time are very different from ours -- and these challenges have a huge impact on their ability to realize their potential.Co-chair, the Bill and Melinda Gates FoundationCo-chair, the Bill and Melinda Gates FoundationEconomic justice is a racial justice issue and power dilemma. Without strong black working-class groups, nothing of lasting substance can be done electorally, politically, or economically.Executive Director, Drum Major InstituteAlmost all of us (96 percent) have heard of Alzheimer\u0027s disease. Nearly four in five of us know, or have known, someone that has been diagnosed with it. But even with all of that first-hand experience, we aren\u0027t doing much about it.Award-winning journalist, bestselling author and leading Alzheimer’s advocateIf law enforcement is required to show probable cause to a judge that a crime has been committed or is being planned in order to execute a search, that burden -- not warrant-proof encryption -- is the strongest protection of our privacy from state intrusion.United States Senator (Ret.)Manhattan District AttorneyEvery so often, a state judge\u0027s conflict of interest in deciding a particular case is so extreme and antithetical to fundamental fairness that the Supreme Court needs to step in to cleanse the taint.Senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of LawThis year, between April 19 and 21, the United Nations General Assembly will hold a special session on drugs and the world will have a chance to change course. As we approach that event, we need to ask ourselves if we are on the right policy path.Chair of the Kofi Annan Foundation and The Elders; Secretary-General of the United Nations, 1997-2006Just as the progress of the first Reconstruction was followed by decades of retrenchment and reversal, many of the formidable threats millions of poor children and families -- of all races, but especially children of color -- face today are very dangerous steps backwards.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundIt is time to admit that the word \"white\" is wiping out the word \"evangelical.\"Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersWe remember Trayvon on this day because his death should serve as a daily reminder of the very real work left undone. His memory serves as our invitation to help fix a broken system. It will become better when we all become involvedDirector of Communications \u0026 Media Relations for the Campaign For Youth JusticeRepublican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee announced that they will not consider any nominee put forward by our nation\u0027s president. This is unconscionable. If they carry through on this threat, it will be directly incompatible with their solemn responsibilities under the U.S. Constitution.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoSorry, John. Female voters are listening carefully -- very carefully -- and women are not stupid. They know doublespeak when they hear it, and they just got an earful of it from you.Money Editor, Ms. magazine; national gender pay equity consultant, Director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsYou don\u0027t often hear Republicans calling for the federal government to interfere with the constitutional rights of states to manage their affairs, but I guess they\u0027re willing to make an exception when it would help unscrupulous insurance companies rip people off.U.S. Senator from MinnesotaWhat\u0027s the answer to our obesity crisis? Well, I have to admit we don\u0027t know. But we\u0027re going to spend this year looking for as many answers as we can find. Small ideas. Big ideas. Ideas that are already making a difference.Editor-in-Chief, HuffPost AustraliaLast week, I had the pleasure of participating in TEDTalks 2016, where I discussed many of the challenges presented by the climate crisis. But a powerful shift has been taking place, and it is clear that we will ultimately prevail. Here\u0027s why.Chairman, Generation Investment Management and The Climate Reality ProjectOnce I removed the dogmatic lens that had informed my biblical interpretations, I found a figure that defended a prostitute and ate with the poor. The life of Jesus simply didn\u0027t reflect the agenda of the political right, so now neither could I.PhD in Religious Studies, Host of The Brain Candy PodcastPresident Trump said he was \"just fooling around\" this morning when he placed two pieces of bacon -- a forbidden food in the Muslim religion -- between the pages of the Quran at the annual National Prayer Breakfast. The action instantly provoked a crisis that threatens to plunge the world into Armageddon.Paul Slansky is amassing a memory for Americans allergic to accountability and addicted to amnesia.Bernie\u0027s history was my starting point in learning more about him, but what he\u0027s pushing for now is what clinched my decision to switch my endorsement for president from Hillary Clinton to him. There are three specific policy reasons I support him.State senator and leading progressive in GABlack people are not being acknowledged or credited for their viral videos and the entertainment they bring to apps such as Twitter and Vine. They aren\u0027t getting appearances on Ellen and they aren\u0027t getting paid either.Editor-in-chief of Affinity Magazine, a social justice and politics magazine for teenagers.What sets McConnell apart is that his motives aren\u0027t really ideological but so baldly about holding onto personal power. His opposition to Obama\u0027s naming of a Scalia replacement puts the majority leader in solid with the far-right Republicans who have threatened his job security.Senior writer, BillMoyers.com. Former senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.The commercials are low-key, but omnipresent. Gentle, warm encouragement, the key message only implicit: vote for the political candidates on the take from the fossil fuel industry. \"I am an energy voter\" commercials are from skilled professionals and they are persuasive.Climatologist and Adjunct Professor, Columbia University Earth InstituteI can understand if you don\u0027t like a government run by Democrats. I can understand if you don\u0027t like certain ideologies, like Socialism. But I can\u0027t understand why you would support someone as hateful, sexist, racist and ignorant as Donald Trump.Citizen JournalistWhen it comes to people of color, the police make San Francisco \"Baghdad by the Bay.\"Author, \u0027Mainstreaming Torture\u0027As Hollywood celebrates its biggest night, I plan to lead the charge for inclusion and representation of all groups in the media. That way, in the very near future we can all look back and take pride in a banner year of diversity for everyone in our industry, regardless of race, creed, orientation, ability or gender.Actor, ComedianHe may have wonderful progressive ideas, but Hillary is a policy wonk. She understands the need for compromise, which means the need for imperfection.Author; Resident Scholar, Women\u0027s Studies Research Center, Brandeis UniversitySenator Sanders, I like you. I admire you. Most of the time, I wish that we had 99 more senators just like you. And I would, wouldn\u0027t I? I\u0027m the kind of voter that you should have a lock on. But Senator, we have a problem, and it\u0027s a big one.Writer, layabout and all-around nogoodnik; web publisher; former Associate News Editor, The Huffington PostI became friends with Ted Kennedy in the last decade of his life. Remembering him on his birthday, I should tell you that the facts of his public life, whether difficult or uplifting, did not fully capture the man.Novelist and contributing opinion writerIt\u0027s time to shift the conversation from the rages of displacement towards the work of removing institutional barriers to space and capital, and expanding access to capital and networks so that more people of all income levels can make the same choices I made to stay, return or relocate to Harlem.Founder of Urban Planning for the American City, based in New York.The establishment doesn\u0027t see what\u0027s happening because it has cut itself off from the lives of most Americans. It also doesn\u0027t wish to understand, because that would mean acknowledging its role in bringing all this on. Yet regardless of the political fates of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, the rebellion against the establishment will continue.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027In these groups you find your biggest cheerleaders -- the people who tell you that you can do the thing, and who convince you to try.Concert-going, upcycling, roller skating, weather lover - awkwardly navigating life.Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
