{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Surveying the current national and international landscape, I often feel that we are living in a split-screen world. And depending on what part of the screen you are looking at, you will have a very different perception of where things stand. Nowhere is this split-screen reality more pronounced than in the African-American community. On one side, it\u0027s a bleak picture: crushing unemployment, widening income and wealth disparity, and a disproportionate number of people in jail. But there is an equally compelling reality on display on the other side of the screen, where we can watch our first black president, our first black attorney general, and the overwhelming influence of the African-American community on fashion, music, sports, and the rest of popular culture. HuffPost BlackVoices, launching today, will cover both sides of the screen, focusing on current events and cultural trends from a black perspective. Check it out and let us know what you think.Read Post | CommentsTrey Ellis, 8/4/11Novelist, Screenwriter, and Associate Professor at Columbia UniversityDespite the many missteps of this first term, I am hopeful that in a second, freed from the need to ever again campaign, President Obama will finally help usher in change that we can believe in.Read Post | CommentsBob Cesca, 8/4/11Producer, Editor of BobCesca.comWe lost. Middle and working class Americans. We\u0027re the losers in the debt ceiling debate. Not President Obama or the Democrats. And it was always going to be this way.

Governor, MarylandAfrican-Americans\u0027 21st century reality is simply this: it\u0027s time to stand for something different. The debate we\u0027re having is no longer productive. It\u0027s time for solutions that come from us, from within our house, our family and ultimately our community as a whole.Read Post | CommentsRuss Feingold, 8/4/11Unless congressional leaders appoint progressives willing to stand up to moneyed interests, the new congressional super committee will be nothing less than a chopping block for Social Security.Read Post | CommentsRene Syler, 8/4/11Author, Good Enough Mother, The Perfectly Imperfect Book of ParentingLike a lot of African American women, I always had a love-hate relationship with my hair, sadly more hate than love. It rarely looked the way I wanted, I spent far too much time and money on it and it was always top of mind.Read Post | CommentsDon McNay, 8/4/11Author of upcoming book, \u0027Wealth Without Wall Street: A Main Street Guide to Making Money\u0027I want to send Wall Street a wake-up call, as they don\u0027t seem to be getting it. The best way is with my dollars. My resources don\u0027t add up to what a chairman of a Wall Street bank gets in an annual bonus, but keeping those dollars away is a start.Read Post | CommentsHeidi Klum, 8/4/11Model, ActressHaving four children, with one having straight hair and three curly, it\u0027s a bit of a new world for me. Growing up with straight hair myself, that was all I really knew how to work with.

Gleick, 8/3/11Water and climate scientist; President, Pacific InstituteApparently, using cartoons to teach children about important science issues of the day raises hackles at Fox, especially when those issues are at odds with their political perspectives.Read Post | CommentsPhaedra Ellis-Lamkins, 8/4/11CEO, Green for AllWhile asthma impacts people young and old, from all races and backgrounds, the hard truth is that it\u0027s hitting the African-American community the hardest.Read Post | CommentsRick Jacobs, 8/3/11Chair of the 700,000-member Courage CampaignA year ago today, U.S. District Court Judge Vaughn R. Walker overturned Prop 8. I thought the war had finally been won. We were elated. It was truly justice done. But as with so much else, it was also justice unfinished.Read Post | CommentsJonathan Bines, 8/4/11Staff writer, Jimmy Kimmel LiveProgressives: Join me in the formation of a new political party that will boldly press for our time-honored principles, such as state ownership of all industry, and the introduction of wolves into populated urban areas.Read Post | CommentsEddie Glaude, Jr., Ph.D., 8/4/11Professor of Religion and Chair of the Center for African American Studies at Princeton UniversityWe have to reimagine struggle in light of the fundamental shift in the very nature of American governance. A new language is urgently needed; a revolution of the imagination in action is required.Read Post | CommentsJason Linkins, 8/3/11Editor, Eat the PressOver the past few days, the media has frothed over their horse-race traditions, pleasuring themselves with the question of who \"won\" the debt ceiling debate. Left out of the conversation, as per usual, are ordinary Americans.Read Post | CommentsChristina Pirello, 8/3/11Authority on natural and whole foodsA daily read of any website reveals an ugly side of America.

Unacceptable.Read Post | CommentsTom Perriello, 8/4/11Former U.S. Representative for Virginia\u0027s 5th congressional districtThe legacy of Mubarak\u0027s trial will be a verdict on the New Egypt. Was this revolution about the removal of a dictator or the establishment of democracy? Will it be about prosecuting select kleptocrats or preventing future corruption?Read Post | CommentsChris Weigant, 8/3/11Political Writer and Blogger at ChrisWeigant.comCongress has chosen its priorities -- a month of paid vacation is more important to them than doing the work they have been hired to do.
