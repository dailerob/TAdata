{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorPutting aside all the political BS, the case raises good questions: Why should the U.S. government provide venture capital? And if there\u0027s a rationale, how much should they provide, and on what terms? What is an acceptable failure rate? The question of should the government backstop investments in new areas of research is actually an odd one, because it\u0027s been doing so since before we were even a nation (the provisional government subsidized machine tools for weaponry to fight the British -- in fact, much of what followed grew out of defense spending). You simply cannot find an economically transformative innovation, from railroads to transistors to lasers to fracking to the Internet, GPS, nanotech, and so on, that doesn\u0027t have a government fingerprint on it somewhere.Comments (256)Bob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowIt\u0027s all yet another case study in how the Republicans too often comport themselves in the wake of a disaster -- these self-proclaimed \"patriots\" are merely selective, fair-weather patriots, only willing to lend their unified support when the president is from their own party.Comments (248)Clemantine WamariyaWriter, AdvocateLike many American millennials, an 8th grade field trip first brought me into contact with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Unlike most of my peers, however -- then and now -- visiting the Museum was not my first up-close and personal encounter with genocide.Comments (25)Adrian GrenierActorI can\u0027t entirely escape stress. No one can. Our collective experience requires that we endure at least a certain amount of anxiety, especially when we strive for bigger goals that take us outside our comfort zone.Comments (31)Arianna HuffingtonA lot of the who, what, where, and how of the Boston bombing and what led up to it have already been answered and, no doubt, more details will eventually be filled in. The why, however, is the more elusive question. But it\u0027s also a crucial one.Comments (701)Lori FradkinSenior Lifestyle EditorThe following is not a bucket list, a catalog of wild adventures I\u0027m determined to have before I die. Rather, it\u0027s an attempt to focus on how much more I have to look forward to and to acknowledge that I still have plenty of time to check items off my list.Comments (27)Gavin ShulmanWriter, ProducerI\u0027m done with these crummy Tsarnaev brothers. I\u0027m done with treating them like masterminds when they were merely morons. I\u0027m done trying to figure out what made them tick, when they were just losers.Comments (63)Suzanne PerrymanBlogger at SpecialNeedsMom.comI am a special needs mom. And I have secrets. Things I don\u0027t talk about and other moms don\u0027t know -- or maybe they just forgot about along the way. Here are six of them.Comments (185)Chris Carberry and Artemis WestenbergThe time to start planning the next large international space mission is now. That mission should be a human mission to Mars. Despite the troubling economic and budgetary times, there is clear support in the U.S. for human Mars exploration.CommentsRalph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorThe Boston Marathon bombings killed three and injured more than 180. The West, Texas industrial explosion killed at least 14 and injured more than 180. Guess which one drew the greater media and law enforcement response?Comments (154)Ann BrenoffSenior Writer, The Huffington PostOn my wedding night in a beautiful mountain lodge that we had rented out for the occasion, my then 80-something Aunt Sophie called the front desk at midnight and asked if Frederic, the 26-year-old French chef who had just fed us a sublime meal and spent much of the evening dancing with her, could please come to her cabin to remove the spider she had just found.Comments (88)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027Stories are what change the world, more than just ideas. And that\u0027s what I am seeing and hearing on the road -- stories that will change people for the common good. Even Washington can be affected by the stories outside of Washington -- take immigration reform for example.CommentsDavid LohrSenior Crime ReporterI was raised nearly my entire life without knowing my father. I was brought up believing that another man, who passed away in 2003, was my father. Now, in just days, the man who killed my real father will be sentenced for taking his life.Comments (225)Shaquille O\u0027Neal and Ray ChambersMalaria is a disease that is not on the top of mind of the general public, and it\u0027s important that we change this, the more people know about it, the better chance we have to make it a disease of the past. We can\u0027t let a mosquito win.CommentsSpencer WellsNational Geographic Explorer-in-Residence and Director of the Genographic ProjectAs I celebrate my birthday, I\u0027m cognizant of a friend who is being celebrated for turning 60 this year. She\u0027s been in my life since before I was born, and she will be around long after I\u0027ve faded into distant memory. I\u0027m talking, of course, about deoxyribonucleic acid -- DNA.Comments (14)Patricia BosworthContributing Editor, Vanity FairLast night Bette Midler made a triumphant return to Broadway for the first time in 30 years, playing the brash superagent Sue Mengers in John Logan\u0027s one-woman show I\u0027ll Eat You Last. It was a bravura performance.CommentsChristy Turlington BurnsFounder, Every Mother Counts, Director/Producer, NO WOMAN, NO CRY, global maternal health advocate, mom, modelOn this visit to Haiti, I feel optimistic about the future Haitians can achieve, and proud of the work being done to create that future.CommentsTodd GitlinProfessor of Journalism and Sociology, Columbia UniversityWill it do for journalists and editors to remain thoroughly tangled up in their own remarkably unquestioned assumptions about what constitutes news? It\u0027s long past time to reconsider some journalistic conventions.Comments (18)Kevin McDonoughSyndicated columnist and television criticIt may seem insensitive, at the very least, to evoke Ghostbusters while discussing a tragedy that claimed at least 15 lives. But it\u0027s worth thinking about how much our political/entertainment culture has ridiculed and feminized the impulse towards regulation and safety.Comments (43)Kristin van OgtropManaging Editor, Real SimpleMy mother was talking about more than energy level and circadian rhythm. It\u0027s also an expression of the belief that the future will be an improvement upon the past. It is about faith, determination and progress.CommentsPeter DiamandisChairman/CEO, X PRIZE FoundationThis is an interview with the man who knows more successful CEOs and billionaires than almost anyone else, and he shared with me some of what he learned in his encounters with them.CommentsDr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarWhile discipline is crucial during all stages of raising a child, discipline is not about getting even, inducing guilt, or even punishing -- all of which are forms of shaming a child. Instead, disciplining, at any age, is about correcting and guiding him toward more appropriate behavior.Comments (237)Josh HorwitzExecutive Director, Coalition to Stop Gun ViolenceNational tragedies like the Boston bombing are moments when all segments of American society come together to emphasize the values that we hold in common. The notion that some would see this instead as an opportunity to divide us -- to foment a civil war -- is deeply disturbing.Comments (234)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkJust as the appalling alleged acts of Jared Loughner, James Holmes, Adam Lanza, Timothy McVeigh and others do not represent their entire communities, we cannot allow the appalling acts of Tamerlan and Dzhokhar to speak for their respective communities whether it be Islamic, Chechen or any other.Comments (227)Ronnie WoodMember of iconic rock band, the Rolling Stones; guitarist, artist, writerI think people are \u0027just creative\u0027 and this can be expressed in a number of ways. Bob Dylan and David Bowie create both music and art. Michelangelo could paint and sculpt. For me, it\u0027s just another way of expressing myself.Comments (12)Lincoln MitchellHarriman Institute, Columbia UniversityOne of the central challenges in fighting terrorism is vigilantly maintaining our open societies, public events and civic life in spite of real threats. Ironically, we will become more vulnerable if this vigilance were to weaken.CommentsAlon Ben-MeirSenior Fellow, NYU\u0027s Center for Global AffairsThe resurrection of Arab Peace Initiative by the United States is a strategic and timely move. Sadly, however, the API should have all along constituted the basis for a negotiated Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement.Comments (60)Sugar RautbordAuthor of three bestselling novelsI loved Bette, the set, Logan\u0027s book and the intimacy created with Sue on the couch and we the uninvited dinner guests in our armchairs. Sheer genius in every detail.CommentsWilliam BradleyPolitical Analyst, NewWestNotes.comIf the Boston bombing was terrorism, as Tsarnaev claims, it looks like an especially boneheaded form of terrorism. Let\u0027s call it idiocratic terrorism. That\u0027s an adaptation of the title of the cult 2006 film Idiocracy, a satire about a dystopic future in which pretty much everyone is an idiot.Comments (124)Michelle BersellVisionary leader in emotional consciousnessBy adding some technology to the mix, you won\u0027t hide so often from your bad moods because you\u0027ll know how to address them in an empowered manner. Doing so will make you feel more unstoppable. And the truth is that your unstoppable self is your authentic self.CommentsVicki LarsonJournalist, mother, thinkerForget about \"two becoming one\" when a man and woman marry; in fact, what we really experience is a \"his\" and a \"hers\" marriage -- a husband\u0027s and a wife\u0027s.Comments (470)Mick Ebeling, 2013.26.04Michael J.
