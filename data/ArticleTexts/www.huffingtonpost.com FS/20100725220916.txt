{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, President Obama signed the financial regulation bill, Facebook signed up its 500 millionth member, and the Senate Judiciary committee signed off on Elena Kagan. But the news cycle was dominated by the media frenzy over Shirley Sherrod. BigGovernment.com turned the obscure USDA worker\u0027s tale of racial awakening into a grainy video snippet \"proving\" reverse racism. Fox News tore into the story like rabid jackals with a taste for blood and race baiting (Shepard Smith was a noble exception). Tom Vilsack revealed an itchy trigger finger, having an underling force Sherrod to resign via BlackBerry because \"you are going to be on Glenn Beck tonight.\" So the administration left no doubt it\u0027s afraid of Beck\u0027s shadow, and the president insisted that the buck stops... somewhere else, pointing the finger at the \"media culture.\" The White House and a shamed media want to brand this a \"teachable moment\" but will the lesson stick?Read Post | CommentsGordon Brown, 07.24.2010Former Prime Minister of the United KingdomAfricans have always inspired progressives with the heroism of their struggle -- against the wrongs of imperialism, against apartheid, against poverty. But it is time not merely to inspire us, but to lead us.Read Post | CommentsWillie Nelson, 07.21.2010Singer/Songwriter, President of Farm AidThe real story of Shirley Sherrod deserved to be told a long time ago.

Bogle, 07.22.2010Founder, The Vanguard Group, Inc.We have moved from a society in which \"there are some things that one simply does not do\" to one in which \"if everyone else is doing it, I can too.\" Business ethics and professional standards have been lost in the shuffle.Read Post | CommentsEzekiel J.

Bernie Sanders, 07.23.2010Independent U.S. Senator from VermontToday, not content with huge tax breaks on their income; not content with massive corporate tax loopholes, the ruling elite and their lobbyists are working feverishly to either eliminate the estate tax or substantially lower it.

Harry Reid, 07.23.2010Senate Majority LeaderThe Republicans have decided, en bloc, to block sensible legislation that reduces pollution and lowers carbon emissions.
