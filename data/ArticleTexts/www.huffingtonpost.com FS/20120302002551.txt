{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Executive Editor, The Huffington PostWe live in the world\u0027s richest country, a cornucopia brimming with spacious, warm homes; supermarkets stuffed with food; educational opportunities; cradles of innovation; a dizzying cascade of techno-gadgets, mobile devices, and flat-panel TVs; tank-sized cars and luxury resorts -- and, of course, piles and piles of money. Yet we are also home to a middle class confronting the erosion of several decades of financial and social gains and a deeply entrenched population of impoverished Americans cursed with diminished opportunities, diminished ways of escape, and diminished expectations. Today, the Huffington Post is launching a year-long exploration and examination of the lives of middle class and poor Americans in a series called \"Breakdown: Americans on the Edge.\"Read Post | Comments (252)Arianna Huffington, 03/01/12I\u0027m delighted to announce the launch of HuffPost Money, a section dedicated to looking at the big financial stories of our time, with an eye on answering the question: how do the day\u0027s headlines affect you and your finances?

But he\u0027s also highly simplistic in his view that it creates liberals or atheists -- or that it intentionally discriminates against conservatives or the devout.Read Post | Comments (260)Sheila Bair, 03/01/12Former Chairman, FDIC; Advisor, Pew Charitable TrustsWould you take money that your daughter needs for braces and make a short term loan to a Wall Street firm? Probably not, but if you\u0027ve put your ready cash in a prime money market fund, those are the kinds of places where your money may be sitting now.Read Post | CommentsRobert Naiman, 03/01/12Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicyA new poll suggests that the reason that the majority of Israelis do not support an Israeli military strike on Iran without U.S. approval is that they share the cautions of U.S. officials -- they think that the costs would be high, and the benefits small or nonexistent.Read Post | Comments (64)Richard Cordray, 03/01/12Director, Consumer Financial Protection BureauWe have heard story after story of consumers being hit with fees they did not expect and do not understand.

That would be bad news for the nation, but good news for Corrections Corporation of America.Read Post | CommentsChris Stedman, 03/01/12Author, Humanist Chaplaincy at Harvard Fellow and founder, State of FormationIf atheists and Christians started seeing one another as necessary partners in making the world a better place, what might we come to understand about each other? What might we come to better understand about ourselves? What might we accomplish together?Read Post | CommentsEliot Daley, 03/01/12Writer; formerly an executive, consultant, and pastor/chaplainWhy should your employer have any say whatsoever about how you manage your reproductive health? Why? Can you think of one good reason? Your employer, of all people, influencing the most intimate decisions in your life -- could anything be more ridiculous?Read Post | Comments (52)Diane Ehrensaft, Ph.D., 03/01/12Developmental and clinical psychologist; mental health director, Child and Adolescent Gender CenterAs we see the media\u0027s growing interest in transgender and gender-nonconforming children and their families, I can\u0027t underscore enough the responsibility of journalists who cover them and the issues related to these children and young people to get the terminology right.Read Post | CommentsAlton Lu, 03/01/1218-year-old senior in high schoolIn the recent Arizona Republican debate, the candidates, aside from Ron Paul, were seen advocating for stronger sanctions and military action against Iran.Read Post | CommentsTodd Brewster, 03/01/12Director, National Constitution Center\u0027s Peter Jennings ProjectIn a world of gray hues, Romney\u0027s appeal as a businessman-politician is refreshingly black and white. You profit or you don\u0027t. But beware: this superficial characterization overlooks critical differences between business and politics.Read Post | CommentsAnnie McKee, 03/01/12Bestselling author, leadership advisor, cofounder of Teleos Leadership InstituteJoin our nation\u0027s political discussion with answers and ideas about the future.
