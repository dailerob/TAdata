{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupIn the end, Obama won last night\u0027s debate against Romney on points. But the total score was less important than what he did -- and what Romney didn\u0027t do -- to woo women who remain \"gettable\" in states such as Colorado, Virginia and Ohio. Jim Messina, the president\u0027s campaign manager, was laser-focused on those voters here at Hofstra before and after the debate. \"The undecideds that matter most are women in those states,\" he said. In Colorado, which leans libertarian as much as Democrat or Republican, undecided women are pulled towards Romney by his emphasis on low-tax, anti-regulatory policies that he says will help \"small business.\" But that same libertarian streak pulls Colorado women towards Obama for his strong support of abortion rights, reproductive freedoms, health care and pay equity. It was no accident that the president hit all of those themes last night.Read Post | Comments (3,773)Bob Cesca, 10/17/12Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez Show, Media ProducerThis was arguably one of those historic debate sequences which I believe will be replayed for many years to come. The challenger, riding a wave of solid polls following a strong first debate, literally imploded on the national stage.Read Post | Comments (979)Lauren States, 10.17.2012Vice President, CTO Cloud Computing, IBMToday, everyone acknowledges the power of cloud computing. So, when companies hesitate to adopt the cloud, it\u0027s not because their executives don\u0027t understand how profoundly the technology can transform their operations. No. The main reason cited by most companies is one of risk.Read Post | Comments (11)Robert Reich, 10/17/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Tuesday night our president was articulate and forceful -- in sharp contrast to his performance in the first presidential debate. He stated his beliefs. He defended his record. He told America where he wanted to take the nation in his second term.Read Post | Comments (806)Dan Froomkin, 10/17/12Senior Washington Correspondent, Huffington PostFar from reversing the Bush-Cheney executive power grab, President Obama is taking it to new extremes. More than a decade after it started, we still have no clue how much the government is listening in on us or reading our email. And the government\u0027s response to this unprecedented secrecy is a war on leaks.Read Post | Comments (104)Wendy Fontaine, 10/17/12Writer, Mother and Graduate StudentI was annoyed during most of last night\u0027s presidential debate, but when Mitt Romney insinuated that single-parent families are to blame for gun violence in America, my blood pressure shot through the roof.Read Post | Comments (1,023)Robert L. Borosage, 10/17/12President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureThis was the debate that finally exposed Mitt Romney as an empty suit running a campaign that is disingenuous at its core.

If the election is going to be as tight as predicted, could the retelling of one of the highlights of the president\u0027s first term capture enough undecided voters to have a real impact?Read Post | Comments (21)Kathleen Reardon, 10/17/12Professor, USC Marshall School; Author, \"The Secret Handshake\" and \"Comebacks At Work\"This is an election, Mr. Romney, not a date.
