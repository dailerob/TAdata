{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressThe 2016 contest has long been on like Donkey Kong. The only question is, is it going to be covered sensibly or not? There are some examples of sensible coverage. Why, just this week I had the pleasure of reading Patrick Caldwell\u0027s story describing how Clinton might interact with the various super PACs that ally themselves with her presidential ambitions. That\u0027s the sort of coverage one should likely file under \"useful.\" Unfortunately, you can\u0027t have a signal-to-noise ratio without the noise. And since Clinton looms the largest over the 2016 landscape right now, coverage of her proto-campaign is full of it: \"Why hasn\u0027t Clinton performed this banal task? What is Clinton going to do about this thing about which she can do nothing? When will Clinton wander onto this rug, so that it can be pulled out from under her?\"Being disabled doesn\u0027t automatically make you a noble inspiration to all humanity, says Stella Young. In this very funny talk, she breaks down society\u0027s habit of turning disabled people into \"inspiration porn.\"\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"Most Americans probably think a major goal of philanthropy is to fight poverty. But a closer look reveals that giving by foundations and philanthropists exacerbates wealth inequality in the United States.Senior Fellow, Georgetown Public Policy InstituteHave you ever wondered about the amazingly effective campaign to sell the Common Core standards to the media, the business community, and the public? How did it happen that advocates for the standards used the same language, the same talking points, the same claims, no matter where they were located?Research Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027At 29 years old, LeBron James is the biggest superstar in the world. Yet this kid from Northeast Ohio, who had a difficult childhood, is a doting father, a loving husband and a wonderful son. His Akron roots run deep.Hofstra Journalism ProfessorReal talk: Ingredients on the side are not the same as ingredients on the food item. There\u0027s a psychological difference that impacts the taste. Picky appetizer people ruin meals (and lives).Writer, humorist, and author of sassandbalderdash.comHave you ever paused and asked the simple question: Where do we go from here? None of you -- Bennett, Haniyeh, Netanyahu, Meshal, and Abbas -- know what will be the fate of Israel and Palestine in five or 10 years should you continue to pursue your bankrupt policy.Senior Fellow, NYU\u0027s Center for Global AffairsForgetting can be a beautiful thing, but sometimes we live too much in the present. We forget about all the girls and women we have been.Co-author, Graduates in WonderlandThe deplorable and frightening violence erupting in Israel and in the occupied territories is not an inevitable blood feud. It is the logical outcome of leaders who cannot come to the table to negotiate peace for the sake of their people.Leeat Granek, PhDAs a group fitness instructor and health coach, I am often asked the same questions: What do you do to stay fit? What do you eat? How often do you exercise and what do you do? If you are confused as to what\u0027s healthy, you are not alone.National fitness expert, speaker, contributor to Prevention magazine, author of several books and fitness DVDsAdmire me for what I do -- for writing well, raising decent kids or having a lovely garden. But don\u0027t admire me just for existing, just because I live a mostly unremarkable life with scars and a limp and a history of dozens of broken bones.Author, \u0027No Easy Choice: A Story of Disability, Parenthood, and Faith in an Age of Advanced Reproduction\u0027In fiction, be it on the screen or the page, good guys and bad guys alike take risks. Almost all crime fiction requires that someone (or several someones) get waxed.WriterTonight, I\u0027m joined by music legends Joe Elliott and Rick Savage, who reflect on their careers. With legions of fans around the world, the pop-metal band has sold more than 100 million records worldwide and recently embarked on a 42-city national tour to support U.S. troops.PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorWhat if you heard that other fishermen were unintentionally catching large numbers of vulnerable marine animals like dolphins, whales, and sea turtles -- damaging gear and hurting their own bottom lines? Waste on this scale occurs every day in many U.S. fisheries, hurting both fishermen and marine life.Actor; board member, OceanaCEO, OceanaMake them feel part of something bigger. Let them know you will be there for them. Remember words that have become the Márquez-Greene family\u0027s motto: \"Love Wins.\" And work without ceasing for common sense gun safety measures to stop the scourge of violence in America.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe most obvious way to neutralize this advantage is for the Republicans to nominate a woman for president. Nominating a woman for president is something very different from finding a previously obscure female politician, putting her on the ticket at the last minute and hoping for the best.lincolnmitchell.comThis summer, as you enjoy time off of work, keep in mind that the little things we do everyday and the opportunities we have to use our voice will have enormous impact for those living in poverty globally.Senior Vice President, Women Thrive WorldwideRecent statements from Israeli officials indicate that this is war, and that it will not end soon. Yet wars of \"self-defense\" against the Gaza strip to weaken Hamas -- in 2008 and again in 2012 -- have proven futile again and again.Foreign Policy Fellow at the Brookings Institution\u0027s Doha Center and Adjunct Professor at Georgetown University in QatarMom was hysterical. Equal parts angry, touched and relieved I wasn\u0027t with child. \"How can I be mad?\" she asked, I had hoped hypothetically. She loved it. But she was definitely kind of mad.Writer. Thinker. Bad hand-shaker.You\u0027re going to hear a lot about Obamacare this fall, especially from Republicans. They\u0027ll try to convince you that it was a bad deal. They\u0027ll throw numbers at you to make you think that the cost of health insurance is spiraling out of control. In all likelihood those numbers will be incorrect, but how will you know?Lecturer in the College of Business and Economics at California State University, Los AngelesBe smart about your smartphone use. See the phone for what it is: a tool for communication and for information. It doesn\u0027t define you, make you more appealing to others, nor should it rule your life.Licensed psychotherapist, executive coach, columnist, and author of \"Be Fearless: Change Your Life in 28 Days\"The alleged spying on behalf of the NSA by an employee of Germany\u0027s intelligence agency and the transmission of state secrets and classified information to the CIA provide troubling evidence of the American intelligence community\u0027s terrible activities against democratic institutions in Germany.German Parliament MemberBrooke is not inspiring because she is autistic. She is inspiring because she lives her life in a way that commands respect and demands acceptance.Mother and blogger, A Diary of a MomDemocratic politicians sure do fight over some important policy issues from time to time, but on message, good old fashioned progressive populism is winning the day. And it might just carry us to a surprisingly good election year in a very challenging political environment.Co-Founder, Democracy PartnersOnce upon a time, if a character on TV or in a movie tortured someone, it was a sure sign that he was a bad guy. Now, the torturers are the all-American heroes. We\u0027re not only living in a post-9/11 world, we\u0027re stuck with Jack Bauer in the 25th hour.Author, \u0027Mainstreaming Torture\u0027This deal is being trumpeted as a major win for the American people. It\u0027s not. The money\u0027s not enough (and some of it probably won\u0027t be paid out), the wrong people are paying, and there will be no prosecutions for criminal behavior.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourThe fact is that data are worth a lot of money. Google and Facebook built $100 billion-plus companies based on mining data. Shouldn\u0027t you?Chairman/CEO, XPRIZEWhen you do something unexpected or out of the ordinary, it rarely starts out as such. You do it because you want to or because it could lead to a better way of life. You\u0027re not thinking about the lasting impact it may or may not have on people, or how they will react to your decision to do something crazy.writer with Cerebral Palsy who wants to be recognized for her work rather than her disabilitySummertime reading recommendations are usually about escapism -- mysteries, thrillers, melodramas, romances -- meant to stand in for vacations from our everyday lives. But I\u0027d like to add a different sort of book to your summer reading queue. While it\u0027s not escapism, it is about a departure from our everyday work lives. I\u0027m talking about The Alliance: Managing Talent in the Networked Age by Reid Hoffman, Ben Casnocha and Chris Yeh.If we are going to make the transformative change away from fossil fuel, we need thousands of institutions and millions of individuals to make the same choice that Tom Steyer and the World Council of Churches and the University of Dayton trustees made: to look at the emerging science and to understand that we can\u0027t go on as we did before.Author of a dozen books, including \u0027The End of Nature\u0027 and \u0027Deep Economy\u0027The never-ending war in Iraq and the birth of the newly declared Islamic State -- the first caliphate since the fall of the Ottoman Empire -- are the unintended consequences of a set of crudely forged intelligence documents we collectively call The Italian Letter.Author, \u0027The Italian Letter: The Forgery That Started The Iraq War\u0027Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"CHENEY PUSHES SAME WAR JUNK AS \u002702",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
