{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027One big reason America was far more equal in the 1950s and 1960s than now is unions were stronger then. That gave workers bargaining power to get a fair share of the economy\u0027s gains -- and unions helped improve wages and working conditions for everyone. But as union membership has weakened -- from more than a third of all private-sector workers belonging unions in the 1950s to fewer than 7 percent today -- the bargaining power of average workers has all but disappeared. In fact, the decline of the American middle class mirrors almost exactly the decline of American labor union membership.Clinton is admired -- or at least respected -- for her decades of world travel as first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of state. But officials and regular citizens alike were vague at best, suspicious at worst, when asked to judge her accomplishments and strategic vision as secretary of state.Global Editorial DirectorThe Senate\u0027s pro-surveillance wing is scrambling to advance new legislation to restore the NSA\u0027s unchecked ability to spy on all of us. And they\u0027re in a rush. Authorization for the federal government\u0027s bulk collection of phone records is set to expire on June 1.Senior Director of Strategy, Free PressIn a series of peculiar events that can only be contextually placed in the reality of the 21st century, football, war, and diplomacy meet and intertwine. Today, Russia and the U.S take one more step in their very own modern adaptation of the Cold War in the curious battlefield of international soccer.Masters in Science in Global Affairs and Transnational Security student at New York UniversityIn the month since he announced his bid, Sanders\u0027 coverage seems to pale in comparison to comparable Republican candidates who face an arduous task of obtaining their party\u0027s nomination. The reluctance is ironic, since the D.C. press corps for months brayed loudly about how Hillary Clinton must face a primary challenger. Now she has one, and the press can barely feign interest?Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaI must see her do evil, and I must revel in it. All of the evil that can be done, I must see done by Cersei Lannister. I can\u0027t get enough. I am aware that this is an unpopular sentiment. Or, at least, it\u0027s an uncommon admission.Founder, Grub Street; former Associate News Editor, The Huffington PostGiven that \"the facts\" the United States used to justify the invasion of Iraq were all wrong, most of the presidential candidates have admitted they might not have launched that particular war. What we have yet to hear from presidential candidates or the habitual hawks is the appropriate spiritual response to the war in Iraq: repentance.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersWe don\u0027t need to jump into the arms and beds of different people until one of them decides to stay for a little while longer than the rest. We don\u0027t need titles and commitment that\u0027s rushed, or done so for any reason influenced by others.Writer, Marketing Co-op, and College Student.The world capitalist economic system has become so dysfunctional in the 21st Century that it cannot be defended rationally, but requires a particular moral/political ideology grounded in the assumption that human beings are fundamentally to be defined as free, autonomous and rational individuals.Confucian scholarFinding life elsewhere would end our cosmic isolation: if there is life in our own planetary backyard, then life is probably common throughout the universe. These enticing possibilities are why my colleagues and I have spent 17 years developing a spacecraft mission dedicated to understanding Europa.Senior Research Scientist, NASA\u0027s Jet Propulsion LaboratoryThere is a tendency in sports to give breaks to the people who are good at their jobs. We should not do this. But it certainly seems to happen. But when it comes to Isiah Thomas, there is simply no evidence that he is actually good at judging talent.Co-author, \u0027Stumbling on Wins\u0027; Economics professor, Southern Utah UniversityFriday, Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht will be sentenced. He faces the possibility of between 20 years to life behind bars because drugs were bought and sold on his website. But Silk Road\u0027s online marketplace actually reduced the harms of drugs in several key ways.Nightlife Community Engagement Manager, Drug Policy Allianceit\u0027s true that Hillary Clinton has adopted economic rhetoric which is Warren-like, at least in tone. The difference lies in policy specifics, especially on critical economic issues: Warren offers them. So far, Clinton hasn\u0027t.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourIt\u0027s no surprise that the world of sushi has developed its own set of myths, exaggerations, and bold-faced lies.Everything worth caring about in food, drink, and travelThe President does not want an anti-slavery provision in what he calls the \"most progressive trade deal of all time\" because it would keep a country noted for its egregious slave trade out of the treaty? I have to admit this bothers me just a little. Okay, a massive amount.Co-Founder, Democracy PartnersThis is the beginning of my story. My story to take a stage 4 cancer diagnosis and unravel it into my license to live. In fact, to live an even better and richer life than I ever could have imagined possible before cancer.Lifestyle Architect,Community Developer, Bravolebrity, World Wanderer, and Stage 4 Cancer WarriorEvaluating teachers on their students\u0027 performance is an issue that has elicited much comment of late. In essence, this view assumes that if students aren\u0027t learning, the fault lies squarely with their teachers alone.Retired high-school teacherUltimately, if we want to fill our glasses with clean water, and if we want our kids to swim, fish, or play safely in our waters, we have to be willing to protect our all nation\u0027s waters, large and small, from the Great Lakes to the headwater streams.President, EarthjusticeThis time there was no warning. There was no hurricane, no tropical storm warning -- just a flash flood warning, which is common in Houston and usually doesn\u0027t mean homes will flood.Writer, BloggerThe recent Irish referendum was a national act of inclusion and liberation for gay and lesbian people. But it was also a powerful statement to the rest of the world from a country, once considered to be among the most socially conservative.Politician, former Deputy Prime Minister of IrelandSouth Korea\u0027s Jeju Island is a popular tourist destination full of spas, resorts, golf courses, sandy beaches, waterfalls and hiking trails. But if you really want to get rejuvenated, skip the tourist hotspots and go directly to the village of Gangjeong to support the extraordinary community that has been opposing the building of a naval base since 2007.Co-founder, CODEPINK: Women for PeaceWe all appreciate the elegance of simple solutions to complex problems. But we know too that simplicity can often masquerade as truth, hiding a more nuanced reality. Such is the case with inflammation, where pseudoscience, exaggerated claims, false promises, and dangerous oversimplification have dominated for too long.Scientist and former White House Senior Policy Analyst; Ph.D. in marine biology/neurophysiologyFirst dates can be pretty nerve-racking. We can find ourselves plagued with fears and worries because we don\u0027t know what to really expect.Self and relationship coach and teacher. Founder of JenniferTwardowski.comInterestingly, it\u0027s not until a major incident happens, such as the Fifa arrests, that people start getting involved with the transparency debate and why the sports industry needs to address the lack of it urgently.Ex-professional footballer, co-founder and director of online professional sports platform Axis StarsWhile the twenty-something other candidates who make up the rest of the GOP field are all fighting over those who agree with neo-cons, Senator Paul figures he can nab the rest -- the growing number of GOP voters who reject neo-con ventures in the Middle East.Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranIt would be best if all soccer fans would make it clear to the world that their passion for the game doesn\u0027t have anything to do with this grotesque show, which for decades, has been staged in Zurich by FIFA.Political journalist for The Huffington Post GermanyAnd that\u0027s how society started spreading the common myth that it takes 21 days to form a new habit (or 30 days or some other magic number). It\u0027s remarkable how often these timelines are quoted as statistical facts.Entrepreneur, weightlifter, and travel photographer at http://jamesclear.comI hope TheDream.US fund and other efforts to invest in the Dreamers do keep growing. But I also hope the leaders of TheDream.US quickly decide that it is being tarnished by including as a participant a college that represents a blatant, unacceptable conflict of interest.Attorney, advocate, writer at RepublicReport.orgThere\u0027s been plenty written about what boards and senior management can do to drive greater diversity. And there\u0027s even more what women can do to advocate for themselves. But what can each of us do, individually, on a day-to-day basis, to advance this?Chair, Ellevate; Past Head; Merrill Lynch and Smith Barney; Investor; Board Member; Crazed UNC Basketball Fan.; MomThe May 10th Agreement struck the right balance between the need to promote innovation and the need to protect public health.
