{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"From news.yahoo.comHere is my list of things from 2005 that I’d love to forget -- that, indeed, we’d all be better off never having cross our minds again: Bill Frist, video diagnostician. Bill Frist, stock market genius. Bill Frist. That drivers will soon have to take out a second mortgage before filling up at the gas pump. That the president thought Harriet Miers was the most qualified candidate for the Supreme Court. That Harriet Miers thought George Bush was the most brilliant man she ever met. That the New York Times held off running the NSA spying story for over a year. That Dick “5 deferments” Cheney was willing to go toe-to-toe with John “5 years as a POW” McCain over the issue of torture… READ MOREREAD POST | comments (37)12.21.2005 Stephen KausAccusing the Bush administration of being disingenuous is no longer a liberal pursuit. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, a bastion of Right-Wing fundamentalism, today called them out for duplicity.READ POST | comments (13)12.21.2005 Katrina vanden HeuvelThe most pernicious aspect of the I.D. movement is its commingling of science and faith, its attempt to use science and mathematics to prove the existence of an intelligent designer.READ POST | comments (22)12.21.2005 Michelle PileckiKudos to the Los Angeles Times for digging up the story undercutting the 9/11 rationale for the recently revealed domestic spying program.READ POST | comments (19)12.21.2005 Aaron FreemanMy mother wanted protest on our permanent records. She insisted that she and her children be counted among those whom bullying law enforcement could not scare.READ POST | comments (17)12.21.2005 Michael ShawJust by putting this image on its Christmas card, the fundamentalist organization can\u0027t help but offer the building as religious iconography.READ POST | comments12.21.2005 Norman HorowitzWe do not know what else we do not know has been going on in this top secret and duplicitous administration.READ POST | comments12.21.2005 Adam McKayDoes Dick Cheney know he\u0027s evil? I mean it. Does he occasionally look up from his breakfast of one hard boiled egg and a plate of heart pills and say to himself, \"Man, I\u0027m an evil fuck”?READ POST | comments (67)12.21.2005 Hooman MajdWhat a year it’s been! I can’t thank you enough for all the negative things you said about our elections here in the spring and summer. Calling them a sham was a real blessing for me.READ POST | comments (23)12.21.2005 Carl PopeToday\u0027s vote was an incontrovertible repudiation of Sen. Stevens and his tactics. It\u0027s heartening to know that even in Washington, which has become a raw, venal place, it\u0027s still possible to go too far, and Stevens went too far.READ POST | comments12.21.2005 Flavia ColganNever before has a Defense Appropriations Bill been held hostage like this for the personal agenda of a Member of Congress. It is just not done.READ POST | comments (35)12.21.2005 Marty KaplanIn honor of the Vice President\u0027s return from Kabul in time to kill Christmas, it would be a lovely tribute if students who can\u0027t get loans explain their predicament by citing the Cheney cuts.READ POST | comments (70)12.21.2005 Gene StoneHollywood is slowly waking up to a new reality: not all Americans are homophobic, and these people attend movies.READ POST | comments (39)12.21.2005 Gary HartIf there was one lesson all of us on the Church Committee learned, it was that there are no secrets, that everything comes out and that the sacrifice of liberty is almost never justified by improved security.READ POST | comments (53)12.21.2005 David SirotaNow, with two swings and misses, the White House is offering up perhaps the most pathetic rationale possible: we were lazy, and we just didn\u0027t feel like upholding the law.READ POST | comments (103)12.21.2005 Robert ScheerThe joy that President Bush has expressed over the country\u0027s latest election, though more restrained than his infamous \"Mission Accomplished\" speech, will similarly come back to haunt him.READ POST | comments (55)12.20.2005 Harry ShearerAt the time we invaded Iraq, one country really did (a) have weapons of mass destruction, (b) a history of armed conflict with its neighbor, and (c) a known record of supporting Al Qaeda and the Taliban -- and that country was Pakistan.READ POST | comments (21)12.20.2005 Joshuah BearmanIt\u0027s telling that when the President does turn his sights to the domestic front, it\u0027s to spy on people rather than roll up a few sleeves and get some actual work done.READ POST | comments (48)12.20.2005 Robert SchlesingerDoes anyone else see any tension between decrying jurists who find new powers/rights/etc in the Constitution and chief executives (or their lawyers) who do so?READ POST | comments (58)12.20.2005 Bruce Kluger \u0026 David SlavinClick here for a special Yuletide offer -- it\u0027s the perfect gift for Red State revelers everywhere!READ POST | comments12.20.2005 Eric AltermanOnce again, the Times is keeping secrets and the stories on it are being broken elsewhere, for other people’s readers.READ POST | comments (15)From theonion.comFrom house.govFrom the BBCFrom www.repubblica.itAP/Tina FinebergFrom The TelegraphAP/Michael Amendolia, The Environment Ministry, HOLogin to Huffington Post  |  Make Huff Post your Home Page  |  RSS/XML  |  Sitemap  |  Advertising  |  JobsCopyright 2005 © HuffingtonPost.com, LLC   |  User Agreement  |  Privacy  |  Comment Policy  |  Powered by MovableType","h1":"",".title":"","h2":"A Big Win For Mother Nature, A Big Loss For Bush, Frist...2005: Things I Want To ForgetI Spy A Democrat?Cory Maye and the limits of blog powerAnd You Say You’re not a Union ManSpy on Me.
