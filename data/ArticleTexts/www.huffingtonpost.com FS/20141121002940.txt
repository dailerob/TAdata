{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"As The Huffington Post has expanded around the world, I have used this space to introduce each of our new international editions. But none of the announcements I\u0027ve made has had as much significance for me personally as what I have to share today: the launch of The Huffington Post in my native Greece, in collaboration with 24MEDIA, Greece\u0027s largest digital media publisher. For me, this is the ultimate homecoming, not only because this is where I and my accent were born but because HuffPost is very firmly rooted in a Greek tradition of bringing people together and facilitating interesting conversations. When we began our international expansion more than three years ago, I knew that one day HuffPost\u0027s own odyssey (to borrow from one of my compatriots) would lead us to Greece. And I couldn\u0027t be happier that that day has finally come.This is a journey we hope will include the voices of all Greeks, from the farthest-flung islands in the Aegean and Ionian Seas to the major cities to the mountain villages.Editorial Director, HuffPost GreeceEbola has taught us that our value system needs a shot in the arm. The real villain is not a virus or microbe, it is when good policies, well thought-out, are not funded or followed through.Lead singer of U2 and cofounder of ONE and (RED)Which American police force had an officer arrested for misconduct almost every single day between 2005 and 2012? No idea? The agency I\u0027m talking about is Customs and Border Protection.Director, Regional Center for Border Rights, ACLU of New MexicoI am convinced that stem cell research means we Baby Boomers will be the last generation to have to watch our parents die of Alzheimer\u0027s or watch our children die prematurely of sickle cell disease. Proposition 71 set this research in motion. Now we have to make sure this research keeps moving forward.Award-winning journalist, bestselling author and activistWhile Greece struggles to find its way out of crushing debt, this is also the moment for Greece to rediscover its true value and wealth as a treasure house of wisdom, or as as Will Durant put it, \"the morning star of the western world.\"Director of Public Affairs, Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of AmericaUntil very recently, virtually no one understood the crucial role the Greek language played in Israel and America becoming two of the world\u0027s most prominent nations.President and Founder, The Washington Oxi Day FoundationI am certain that it will prove to be a vital instrument of pluralism and unbiased information that will serve the common good on both sides of the Atlantic.Ambassador of Greece to the U.S.A.To be sure, too many Greeks are still out of work. Too many communities, families and individuals are still just getting by after being pulled and stretched by the difficulties of recent years.But there are unmistakable signs that a brighter future is beginning to dawn.Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, The Coca-Cola CompanyIf Washington and Tehran want a nuclear deal, it is there for the taking. While the responsibility is shared, the crucial decision rests with the White House. This is not the way that President Obama and his advisers see it, though.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghAs someone who has spent my career focused on domestic economic issues, including a stint of my own at the Treasury Department, I know how important these issues are and how much the people in Treasury can shape policies.Democratic Senator from MassachusettsAlthough another round of violence in Ferguson may well be inevitable, how we understand what happens there is not. It is our responsibility to ask, particularly when things get violent, who it is that has the guns, the tanks, the tear gas, and the batons. Let us not get our history of protest in America wrong one more time.Historian writing on the history, politics, and current impact of incarceration in AmericaI\u0027ve realized that when I give my money to companies that not only ignore the negative effects of unchecked bro-culture but actively embrace dirty tactics to get the advantage, I have become part of the problem that I am working to eradicate.Founder/CEO, APPCityLife Inc. \u0026 Cofounder, Hautepreneurs and HauteHopesThere are millions of Greeks like me around the world, born overseas but drawn to our homeland. We grew up hearing stories from our parents and grandparents about our heroes and our history. And no matter our heritage, our accent, or our current address, we feel a special connection to Greece.Chairman and CEO, The Dow Chemical CompanyThis month is Alzheimer\u0027s Awareness Month. I propose that we raise awareness of just how horrible, destructive and expensive this disease is and that we deploy the attention and resources needed to beat Alzheimer\u0027s before it beats us.Gerontologist, psychologist, author, entrepreneur and public speakerPresident Obama on Thursday made it clear that, if a gridlocked Congress won\u0027t do its job on immigration reform, he will do that job himself. Now we should hope that he can also turn attention to an immigration challenge that falls under his own branch of government: immigration courts.Publisher, California Courts MonitorThese plans can initially seem reasonable, even to progressives, many of whom are wary of the electoral college system. But this isn\u0027t a good-government plan to change the way our presidential elections are conducted. It\u0027s a targeted plot to get more electoral votes for Republicans, even when they\u0027re losing the popular vote.President, People For the American WayBoth guns and tobacco are intrinsically dangerous. Either might have redeeming value to be sure (defense and social pleasure, respectively), but an imaginary world in which there were no guns and no tobacco would be, well, safer. And neither should be the focus of the debate on American liberty.Senior Fellow, DemosRecently, the U.S. Department of Justice announced a groundbreaking initiative to take on one of the most damaging social problems facing the nation: the strained and often broken relationship between many communities and law enforcement. It is time, and past time.Director, Center for Crime Prevention and Control, John Jay College of Criminal JusticeAlthough Brooks decries the extent to which political appeals are phrased in existential terms, he simply tries to wish away the fact that politics addresses fundamental moral issues that go to the heart of what life is all about.Professor of Law Emeritus at Cornell UniversityThere have been so many films that have touched and altered my perception over the years that I couldn\u0027t begin to single out the few that have been the most impactful, but if we only look at some of the films of the past year and the conversations, debate and change they are driving, we start to see how important and irreplaceable these films and filmmakers are.I can\u0027t speak for everyone, but I can say that for my family, Obamacare has saved my parents\u0027 lives. I know that Obamacare is far from perfect. But instead of gutting a law that helps American families, why don\u0027t we make the law work better for all Americans?AttorneyOver the last century, we\u0027ve crushed some of the biggest barriers that previously deterred your education -- socioeconomic status, race, gender, physical space and cost. But this is only the very beginning.Chairman/CEO, XPRIZEWashington needs to recognize that its Pacific pivot is adding insecurity to the region, not stability. With its arms sales and encouragement of ally assertiveness, the United States is bringing peace to the region just like the Colt .45 \"Peacemaker\" brought peace to the Wild West.Director, Foreign Policy In FocusBlack, Asian and Latina women combined barely make up 1 percent of the total number of persons in top positions. White women comprise 14 percent.Ordained minister in ABCUSA, womanist scholar-activist, lecturer, academic advisor for doctoral students and nonprofit executiveThe 2014 election was just as disastrous as 2010. Many observers now agree that Democrats again lost big because they failed to offer a clear economic message to economically insecure voters -- and they once again failed to attack Republicans for sabotaging action to create jobs.Co-Director, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureIf catcalling is just about how men are \"hardwired\" and therefore should be accepted, surely straight men should have no problem with gay men paying them compliments on their bodies and offering greetings on the street, right? Wrong. I don\u0027t even have to make the video to know what would happen. And that exposes the fallacy of catcallers who say that they\u0027re \"just being men.\"Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesI know that as with race writ large, race in the newsroom will not change overnight. In fact, it may get worse before it gets better. But that knowledge in and of itself allows me to forge on.Host, One with FaraiTurkey has the potential of becoming a significant global power, but to realize that, Erdogan must change course or leave. His arrogance, though, and self-styled piousness will prevent him from doing either and deny Turkey its deserving place to play a constructive role on the global stage.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUIn its shadowy \"pivot\" to Africa, the U.S. military has compiled a record remarkably low on successes and high on blowback. Is it time to add Chad to this growing list?Managing Editor, TomDispatch.comUnplug, shut down, get together with friends and family face to face, and be thankful for this crazy life. That\u0027s what the holidays are about -- celebrating life and those close to us who put the color in it.Party Stylist at EviteGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"¡AHORA!",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
