{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"ActorI think Mayor Michael Bloomberg is right. At least in spirit. Food is a drug in the way it is marketed today, which is significantly different from when I grew up. As a child, sweets were referred to as \"treats,\" and were dispensed far more judiciously than they are today.
