{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Adam WinklerProfessor of Law, UCLAThere are obvious hurdles to any gun control advocacy group. There are a lot of single-issue, pro-gun voters in America but not a lot of single-issue, pro-gun-control voters. Everytown, to be successful, will have to inspire more people who support gun control to make this the sole issue they vote on in primary and general elections. It\u0027s also easier for gun rights advocates to mobilize because they are united by a common hobby -- shooting -- and all that it entails. They network at gun ranges, read similar periodicals and websites, and follow the same Twitter feeds. That means that information can reach them easily and they can be political mobilized to call officials or support a given candidate. Gun control advocates aren\u0027t united in the same way, which makes mobilization more difficult. Perhaps Bloomberg\u0027s $50 million will help.We cannot treat a lack of confidence as an involuntary affliction to be tiptoed around, or as an irrational response women just need to get over already. Especially when confidence is not just a prerequisite for a job, but a requirement of the job itself.Amanda DubermanNews Editor, HuffPost WomenA Louisiana elected official once said \"the flag of Texaco flies over the Louisiana State Capitol.\" Right now that flag is flapping in the face of every citizen.Robert F. Kennedy Jr.President, Waterkeeper Alliance; Senior Attorney, NRDCBecause of you, I am beginning again to believe in miracles. Because in the depth of despair over losing your beloved son you took me into your arms and guided me back onto a track where love is real, positive thinking is a choice that saves us, and miracles do happen.Kateri AllardRegistered nurseLaurie DavidProducer, author, NRDC TrusteeFederal laws clearly give us the right as parents to guide the education of our children. While the Secretary of Education has recently pushed for changes to those laws in order to give corporations as much access to your child\u0027s data as any teacher or administrator has, he hasn\u0027t been able to take away our right to decide what\u0027s best for our child. Not yet anyway.Jason EndacottAssistant Professor of Social Studies, University of Arkansas; Blogger, EduSanityPopular political speech needs no protection from the First Amendment -- it never has. It is unpopular political speech -- even downright lies -- which need defending by the courts. As ignoble and as impure as that may sound.Chris WeigantPolitical writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comSometimes tragedies need a public face in order for their full impact to be felt. The next time a Republican politician talks about the noble and inspiring model of a self-sacrificing mother or father -- or tries to say they have a better vision for America\u0027s future -- Americans should remember Charlene Dill.Richard (RJ) EskowSenior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourApparently in many parts of the country, the minimum wage is below the poverty line, so in essence you can be employed, working over 40 hours a week, and still unable to provide a for a family of three. I found this fact perplexing, so I thought I needed the careful logic of Abbott and Costello.Barry LevinsonAcademy Award-winning director, screenwriter and producerIt was not without pleasure that I read Renaud Girard most recent book, Le monde en marche, which collects the best of the chronicles and reports that have appeared in recent years in Le Figaro. I swear. I protest. About Rwanda, I believe the opposite of what Girard writes. But I lap it up.Bernard-Henri LévyFrench philosopher and writerLooking back, I can better appreciate the incredible amount of grace my parents have shown. While it may not have mattered to me as a child, the complete lack of privacy and the inability to dictate their own comings and goings must have posed real challenges for my parents.Vee SomphonManagement Consultant and WriterCommitting to a future powered by clean, renewable energy will mean a healthier America with cleaner air and water, pristine coasts, and protected natural areas. As fossil fuels leave the picture, ours will be a wealthier, more just, and more productive nation.Michael BruneExecutive Director, The Sierra ClubBrittney GrinerWNBA Player, Phoenix MercuryWe need to pause and ask ourselves whether it is ethical to depict the graphic qualities of a human being to Western audiences for the sole purpose of eliciting an emotional experience and ultimately, money.Emily RoenigkSocial \u0026 Digital Media at World ReliefYesterday was Tax Day. Most of us will have dutifully paid our taxes to a government that no longer represents us. Policy decisions on nearly every issue, regardless of public opinion, are decided in favor of a select few who can afford to write massive checks, host campaign fundraisers, and hire armies of lawyers and lobbyists.Josh SilverDirector, Represent.UsYou want to know how the working poor really live? My husband works an average of 50 hours per week just so we can barely make it paycheck to paycheck. We are the in-betweeners. Not making enough to live \"comfortably\" -- but not \"poor\" enough to get any assistance either.Ashley SchmidtbauerMother, wife, and bloggerCommunities around the world are feeling the impacts of climate change on their health, safety and livelihoods. The most recent climate science community report shows a growing threat to our communications, transportation, security and food systems.Susan Casey-LefkowitzDirector of International Programs, Natural Resources Defense CouncilOur choices have implications, not only for how much we enjoy lunch today, but also for longer term goals like fitness and health. But how do we choose? What are the basic cognitive processes that lead from initial hunger pang to this soup or that sandwich?Wray HerbertAuthor, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027I have sweet, incredible, intelligent children sitting in my classroom who are giving up on their lives already. They feel that they only have failure in their futures because they\u0027ve been told they aren\u0027t good enough by a standardized test.Pauline HawkinsEnglish teacherChildren grow up healthier and happier when they experience a direct connection to nature. Just as importantly, those young people are also far more likely to value the natural world when they\u0027ve developed a connection to it. The need for this has never been greater than it is today.Meg LowmanScience writer; Chief of Science and Sustainability, California Academy of SciencesYou might think the 1 percent pays a much higher tax rate than everyone else. But you\u0027d be wrong. Many millionaires pay a lower federal tax rate than many middle-class Americans.Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027With over $51 billion spent per year, the United States will arrest over 1.5 million people for nonviolent crimes, and the ethnic discrepancies are atrocious.Bert McCrackenSinger, The UsedNapoleon\u0027s definition of a military genius was \"The man who can do the average thing when all those around him are going crazy.\" Rich people are similar. They remain normal when everyone else can\u0027t.The Motley FoolTo Educate, Amuse \u0026 EnrichAny violence that is committed in the name of religion comes from extremists. These people masque their political or power agendas in false religious doctrine. We must make that distinction - between religion and extremists -- and combat the extremists.Imam Feisal Abdul RaufChairman, Cordoba InitiativeTatiana Maslany has earned rave reviews, from critics and audiences alike, for her Golden Globe-nominated performance in the sci-fi clone saga Orphan Black.Tavis SmileyPBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorAs much as Koch imagines himself a herald of liberty and a \"free society,\" his politics have been just one more uninspiring assault on the poor and the middle class.
