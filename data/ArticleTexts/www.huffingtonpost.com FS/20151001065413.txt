{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostAfter first refusing to confirm or deny it, the Vatican has confirmed that Pope Francis met with the Kentucky clerk Kim Davis at the Vatican Embassy in Washington, where Davis\u0027s attorney -- who made the news public after the pope\u0027s trip ended -- said Francis told her to \"stay strong.\" We don\u0027t yet know all the details of how the meeting came to pass, but the optics of it are bad no matter what. This simple encounter completely undermines all the goodwill the pope created in downplaying \"the gay issue\" on his U.S. trip. The pope played us for fools, trying to have it both ways. He\u0027s an artful politician, telling different audiences what they want to hear on homosexuality.FBI Director James Comey wants is to put a backdoor in all encryption software so he can read and listen to scrambled messages, with a court order of course. What government doesn\u0027t want that?Fmr. anti-terrorism chief advisor to Presidents Clinton and George W. BushNancy J. and Lawrence P. Huang Professor in the Scheller College of Business at the Georgia Institute of TechnologyHouses of cards--trillions of dollars worth of them, constructed by the U.S. and its allies over more than a decade at a huge cost in lives and treasure--are teetering across the greater Middle East.Author, \"The Watchman\u0027s File\"Seeing the right films at the right time can turn a moviegoer into an activist -- but you need perspective on the issue, you need to feel empowered by rage and allowed to feel joy. Amy Schumer may not have set out to write a comedy for sexual assault survivors, but I think she\u0027s succeeded at the impossible.Director of the Dartmouth Film SocietyWhy the same forces of intolerance that have marred the GOP are pressing the historical rewind button with Planned Parenthood is no mystery. It is a brazen effort to ignite a Republican base with what worked in the past and primarily with evangelical Christians: the culture wars.Writer and environmental activistThe Bernie Sanders campaign has received a grand total of eight minutes of coverage -- one-fifth of Bush\u0027s time, or one-tenth of Clinton\u0027s time (one-twentieth, if you count the scandal coverage). Bernie got roughly the same amount of time as Chris Christie (polling below four percent).Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comPETA recently filed a lawsuit that is egregiously antithetical to the cause of animals rights; it is a case that so tragically captures the rot that is at the very heart of PETA\u0027s corrupted mission that I cannot let this opportunity to highlight their hypocrisy go unchallenged.AuthorThe obligation to provide protection for refugees is general and global: by all countries, for all refugees. Yet their movement across borders today is a perilous tangle of regulations that leave refugees and migrants unprotected, governments frustrated and their citizens outraged.Director of the Global Policy Initiative and University Professor at Columbia UniversityWhat would happen if we eliminated the House of Representatives entirely?Playwright and Political Science Professor; Writing Fellow at Quinnipiac UniversityIt has become common-place to speak of the need to tackle the root causes that make ISIS one of the most brutal insurgent groups in recent history, attractive to disaffected youth across the globe. Translating that notion into policy, however, is proving difficult.Senior fellow, S. Rajaratnam School of International StudiesIt\u0027s the deal you make having pets - you know they don\u0027t live for very long and you will be devastated when you lose them. But the fun, love, companionship and joy they bring is worth the pain at the end and the massive hole they invariably leave. It\u0027s a privilege that pets choose to share their lives with us.Blogs Editor of The Huffington Post UKI can\u0027t accept the plus-size body I was living in because it was a diseased and uncomfortable vessel. It has less to do with my looks and more to do with the quality of life. Not accepting my 300-pound body didn\u0027t mean I was a bad person or that I hated my body--it just meant my body needed to change.Weight loss expert, nutritionist, health coach, author, and former plus-sizer.It\u0027s Banned Books Week -- but no one even bans books anymore. So what\u0027s the point?Communications Director, NCAC (ncac.org)A good time is an easy request in Manhattan. If your attention is not kept active then your mind wonders and you wander down the block.Fashion MarketingSen. Rubio has been \u0027one to watch\u0027 in the GOP for years. He\u0027s known for his aggressive foreign policy positions (see: Libya, Syria, Ukraine) and his support for immigration reform.theSkimm makes it easier to be smarter. We read. You Skimm. Sign up at www.theskimm.com/huffpo to start your day off right.This catastrophic funding crisis risks condemning generations of refugees to live in camps indefinitely. If the GCC could match aid for Syrians to the economic assistance it donates to friendly governments, the impact could be huge.Nonresident Fellow, Brookings InstitutionI\u0027m all for love and a personal relationship with God, but I choose to follow the man who teaches that political action is worship, that social justice is love. What we\u0027re looking for is a church that preaches not just transcendental love, but that prophetic fire that makes Jesus so appealing.Writer and musician from ChicagoWhile Clinton is far more union-friendly than anyone running for the Republican nomination, her labor credentials are significantly worse than her main challenger in the Democratic primary, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.34Justice co-founder and bloggerLike the majority of the population I was born with a colon. However, unlike the majority of the population, I no longer have one. I now have a j-pouch, and it basically changed my life. But the one thing that continued to haunt me was the main reason I almost declined having the surgery: infertility.Mom (to human), Wife, Writer, Mom (to dogs), Shower Singer and Grocery Shopper ExtraordinaireI tried it once. To say it in a different way, to say it in a different context than the one I had come to know it in.\"Faggot.\" I have to admit I admired the way some of my gay friends owned the word, throwing it around like a casual term of endearment.Writer, blogger and activistPharmaceutical companies had a chance to be part of the solution -- they could have innovated amazing cures. They could have worked to solve major health care crises and earned a place of honor among the world\u0027s greatest problem solvers. Instead they chose profit over humanity.Blogger, entrepreneur and mom of two girls. Author of Doorways to Arkomo and Doorways Home.When that so-called \"day of reckoning\" comes, will We the People who benefit from all of the services that the USPS does provide and could provide end up being delivered a bill of goods?Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FuturePot banging, booing and swearing make up the chorus of disgruntled Brazilians, frustrated with a government that has been acting in discordance with their initial campaign promises.Editor in Chief at Brasil PostEmployers are in a unique position to address issues of violence and put policies in place to protect their workers both within and outside the workplace.Executive Director, House of Ruth MarylandThe building no longer exists. No plaque marks the site. But from Sanger\u0027s activism, the movement that today is represented by Planned Parenthood emerged. And as everyone (and especially women) know, a century later the fight for free reproductive choice that Margaret Sanger launched still grinds on.Author: Brooklyn Experience, a guidebook (forthcoming, Rutgers U. Press, 2016)Naturally and completely rationally (ha) I was afraid of having a panic attack on my wedding day. My main concern was that once I was in that church, I couldn\u0027t leave until I was married. It was that mental feeling of being trapped.Wedding blogger, part time unicorn handler, always opinionatedWhile women of all economic and racial backgrounds have abortions, those most affected by lack of access to reproductive health care are women living on the economic brink and are more likely to be women of color.Vice President, Reproductive Health Technologies ProjectWordsmith, photo nerd, sitcom junkie, dog lover, and Editor at 500px. Everything I ever needed to know I learned from Calvin and Hobbes.The importance of the popular protests lies precisely in exposing the dire state of affairs in Lebanon, namely as being corrupt to the bone, lacking legitimacy, and completely outside the control of the Lebanese citizen.Instructor, Lebanese American University (views expressed here are my own)Cubans are no more unruly than other human beings and yet, right now, a park filled with children\u0027s play structures needs to be guarded like a bank, so that the swing seats, the iron from the carousels or the ropes from the climbing nets aren\u0027t stolen.Award-winning Cuban bloggerAs you may know, AAPIs face the model minority myth - the notion that virtually all are well-educated, affluent, and self-sufficient. In reality, the AAPI community is not a monolithic group and each group faces unique challenges.Nani Coloretti serves as the Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).U.S. Deputy Secretary of LaborGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
