{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Military Correspondent, The Huffington PostEvery few days, the headquarters of the U.S.-led war against the Islamic State militias issues a communique on how the war is going. Monday\u0027s report said 27 coalition air attacks on Sunday andMonday struck nine vehicles 12 troop units, 10 fighting positions (foxholes), 10 buildings, an oil refinery, a rocket launcher, three boats and a tank, among other targets. The attacks are framed as progress in the fight against extremism and terrorism, although it\u0027s difficult to make that link in the aftermath of the violence in France. What we do know, from 13 years of painful experience in Iraq and Afghanistan, is that one-sided accounts of combat strikes don\u0027t necessarily reflect a war that\u0027s being won.Paris does not inaugurate a \"new era of Terrorism.\" It changes absolutely nothing in the big picture of Islamic terrorism or Middle East politics or American/Western policy orientations. Outside of France, everything is pretty much as before. That includes perpetuation of the fables and fantasies that are the enemy of sound and sensible policies.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghWherever I travel, the questions follow, suggesting that the U.S., if not exactly crazy, is decidedly a danger to itself and others. It\u0027s past time to wake up, America, and look around. There\u0027s another world out here, an old and friendly one across the ocean, and it\u0027s full of good ideas, tried and true.Author, \u0027They Were Soldiers: How the Wounded Return From America’s Wars -- The Untold Story\u0027I recently got an email invitation from a Democratic congressional office to come to a \"watch party\" to view President Obama\u0027s State of the Union address. His \"fourth-quarter priorities,\" according to the White House-inspired talking points of the message, are \"home ownership, free community college, and high-paying jobs.\" That sounds pretty good. But if you unpack the specifics, the president is offering pretty weak tea.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027In order to fight against fanaticism, there is no other way but to strengthen the principles of liberty, equality, tolerance and respect for the law.Editorial Director, El Huffington PostThis cowardly act against freedom of speech and freedom of expression is reprehensible to all sane people, but sadly, some have used it to exacerbate their already biased views.President, National Action NetworkMost of the discussion assumes that inequality is something that happened. By contrast, the more obvious story is that inequality is something that was done; it was the result of policies that had the effect of redistributing income upward.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027You\u0027ve likely heard some of these core benefits before, but more recent studies have further explored the value of rest, providing some interesting insights.Entrepreneur, CEO at One Mall GroupPolitical and policy reform must emerge in Haiti, but I discovered that by accessing fair trade markets farmers could earn higher profits and begin to save money to buy their own land. First, however, they had to achieve fair trade certification.Academy Award Nominated ActorThe attack in Paris has presented a much more important problem -- while we continue to discuss the nature of this ongoing conflict, the conflict has come to us. And it has found us unprepared.L\u0027Huffington Post Editorial DirectorThe public\u0027s increased awareness of the environmental impact of material disposal has led to support for measures such as New York\u0027s styrofoam ban. It has also led to a certain amount of moralizing and anti-consumption ideology that, in my view, is less useful.Executive Director, Columbia University\u0027s Earth InstituteAt a press conference announcing the \"A Better Past For Certain People Time Machine Research \u0026 Development Act of 2015,\" Republicans waxed nostalgically about that October day when they defeated the Troubled Assets Relief Act and the Dow plunged 750 points.Congressman from New York\u0027s 3rd Congressional District; Author of the forthcoming book \u0027The Global War On Morris\u0027Despite all the rhetoric against Obamacare, conservative governors and state officials aren\u0027t exactly lining up to join the latest Supreme Court challenge designed to gut the Affordable Care Act. To see why, just listen to Walker, whose comments in 2013 controvert the central claim in King.Founder and President, Constitutional Accountability CenterVan Hollen puts the focus squarely on the corporate behavior that has driven down wages and crushed middle-class aspirations. His proposal would boost worker income, which drives the economy forward. When Republicans oppose this, the choice will again be clear to Americans: CEO millionaires or working families.Senior Fellow, Roosevelt Institute; author of \u0027Fighting for Our Health\u0027At a price tag of $1.5 trillion to build and operate over its lifetime, the F-35 combat aircraft is the most expensive weapons program ever undertaken by the Pentagon. It is overpriced, underperforming and unnecessary.Director, Arms and Security Project, Center for International PolicyWhat was once the \"tool\" of law enforcement types, the military, and hunters is now the equivalent of an iPhone, a talisman of connection and social order. It\u0027s something that just about anyone can put in a pocket, a purse, or simply strap on in the full light of day in a land where all of us seem to be heading for the O.K. Corral.Editor, TomDispatch.comWine knows everyone at the party. And even if wine didn\u0027t know everyone at the party, wine would be totally social because no one has a problem talking when wine is involved.Founder, ForeverTwentySomethings.comWe should not disparage what was a quality season for the Cowboys -- including just their second playoff win in six years -- but it\u0027s hard not to ask, \"What if?\"The Huffington Post\u0027s sports columnist, The Schultz ReportFull-throated support for public education should be a no-brainer for Democratic candidates. They should tout their support for neighborhood schools, while pointing out how their Republican opponents want to slash funding and resources.Representing CA\u0027s 41st District -- Member of the House Veterans\u0027 Affairs Committee \u0026 House Education and Workforce CommitteeFor the last few weeks, anti-gay groups have been putting forth their best efforts to stop marriage from starting in Florida. But as luck would have it, their best efforts just weren\u0027t very good.Seattle writer and photographer.In an extraordinary and at times comical about-face, Fox News has ushered in the new year by joining forces with Republicans to denounce President Obama for obstructing Congress and standing in the way of legislative accomplishments.Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaAt 50, I was finally able to admit to myself that I was a lesbian. I have been married for over 25 years and have a daughter, 15. My marriage has been a martyrdom, as I have no desire.Author of BlogSouBiI\u0027m licensed for CCW and I carry a gun from time to time. So I\u0027m not opposed per se to the notion that guns do more good than harm. What I do oppose is constructing an argument for either position out of whole cloth.Mike the Gun GuyThailand\u0027s capital has lost none of its frenetic motion or relaxed informality. But it is a bit quieter of late, with last year\u0027s demonstrators dispersed by the military. However, the junta, which took power in May, is not leaving.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstitutePresident Obama not only handed Castro a huge propaganda victory, but also created a dangerous precedent by signaling our enemies that major policy concessions can be gained by taking an American hostage.Associate Director of the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International University (FIU)The jobs report Friday set off cheering: a quarter million positions added in December; unemployment declining to 5.6 percent. This good news arrived amid a booming stock market and a GDP report showing the strongest growth in 11 years. It\u0027s all so very jolly, except for one looming factor: wages.International President, United SteelworkersPresident Obama and other \"centrists\" largely managed to contain his party\u0027s populist wing throughout his first term. But the rise of Sen. Elizabeth Warren and her allies has emboldened what is now sometimes called the party\u0027s \"Warren wing,\" as more and more Democrats sign on to the progressive populist agenda.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourThis is exactly the kind of comprehensive agenda that this country needs -- a populist economic agenda that would create more jobs, get working people significant raises, and deal with the deep structural flaws in our economic system that have developed over the last 35 years.Co-Founder, Democracy PartnersIt should be clear after four bloody years in Syria that if we are to make any progress moving forward, it is necessary to shed illusions and fantasies that have shaped too much of the discussion about the conflict.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027The dominance of the military over politics has held back the emergence of functional civilian political contestation, leaving a vacuum filled by extremists despite the aspiration of millions of Egyptians for human dignity and non-corrupt government.International Policy Adviser for Human Rights FirstSince September 11, Americans in particular -- though not only -- have supported politicians and opinion-mongers in pivoting their geo-politics and world views on isolated, spectacular, terrible acts by terrible people.Professor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"WALL ST.
