{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOPhil Gramm obviously had the quote of the week. Voters dealing with skyrocketing gas prices and collapsing home values just love being called \"whiners\" by a millionaire. This kind of out-of-touch condescension comes as no surprise to anyone who has followed Gramm\u0027s career. He\u0027s left his fingerprints on some of the worst economic debacles in U.S. history. He was a champion of energy deregulation, which gave us Enron and blackouts and price gouging. He was a champion of deregulating the savings-and-loan industry, the bailout of which cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars. And his leadership on banking deregulation helped create the current sub-prime mortgage crisis. Republicans love to talk about Obama\u0027s lack of experience. I\u0027ll take fresh blood over Gramm\u0027s kind of track record any day of the week.Read Post | CommentsBIOChris Kelly, 07.08.2008The American Family Association\u0027s McDonald\u0027s boycott follows boycotts of Burger King, Carl\u0027s Jr., 7-11, Proctor \u0026 Gamble and Kraft, which means the AFA\u0027s president hasn\u0027t eaten anything for sale in America since the late \u002770s.Read Post | Comments (164)BIODavid Bromwich, 07.10.2008The collapse of the Democratic leadership on FISA was a sheer political calculation.Read Post | Comments (328)BIOPaul Hipp, 07.12.2008Read Post | Comments (20)BIOArianna Huffington, 07.07.2008Buoyed by a reduction in violence in Iraq, John McCain is running a \"the surge has worked\" victory lap and war supporters like Condi \"I\u0027m Proud to Have Overthrown Saddam\" Rice are beating their chests.Read Post | Comments (321)BIOAlec Baldwin, 07.11.2008One of the first things that supporters of Obama ought to realize is that attacking, belittling or characterizing John McCain by emphasizing his age is a mistake.Read Post | Comments (354)BIONaomi Wolf, 07.07.2008The sexualization of torture from the top basically turned Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo Bay into an organized sex-crime ring in which the trafficked sex slaves were US-held prisoners.Read Post | Comments (301)BIOGeorge Lakoff, 07.06.2008Barack Obama should not be moving toward right-wing views on issues -- even with nuanced escape clauses.
