{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"One convention down, one to go. To borrow from a more successful Clint Eastwood appearance: it\u0027s halftime in America. At HuffPost, our convention efforts have four parts. First, our coverage of the conventions themselves, led by our amazing D.C. team. Second, our initiative to help make a dent in the jobs crisis by focusing on what is working, which includes a bipartisan panel discussion on jobs at both conventions, an entrepreneurship expo, and a HuffPost section dedicated to our job creation initiative. Third, the Shadow Conventions, spearheaded by HuffPost Live, which aim to put the spotlight on three important issues that are largely ignored by our two major parties: the influence of money on our political system, entrenched poverty in America, and the disastrous war on drugs. And fourth, the HuffPost Oasis. All of these efforts are deeply intertwined.Read Post | CommentsBob Herbert, 09/03/12Distinguished Senior Fellow, DemosThe decline of the middle class was a result, in part, of public policy choices. Today\u0027s downward mobility can only be reversed by a range of new choices consciously aimed at helping working Americans regain their financial footing.Read Post | Comments (34)Robert Kuttner, 09/02/12Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Democratic paths to deficit reduction are jousting with Republican paths. So here is Ben Bernanke -- a Republican, first appointed by George W. Bush, a huge admirer of Milton Friedman -- saying what no other Republican and too few Democrats are willing to say: The problem is not the deficit, but the risk that Congress will overreact to the deficit.Read Post | Comments (559)David Wild, 09/02/12TV Writer; Contributing Editor, Rolling Stone; Co-Author, \u0027Diary of a Player\"\u0027\"All labor that uplifts humanity has dignity and importance and should be undertaken with painstaking excellence.\" That\u0027s what Martin Luther King, Jr. said, and I have learned to never argue with a good Doctor.

McClennen, 09/02/12Professor, Penn State University; Author, \u0027Colbert\u0027s America: Satire and Democracy\u0027CBS News reported that most of the major claims made by Ryan about Obama\u0027s record were misleading and untrue. Ryan then kept up his pattern of truthiness after the RNC when he lied about his best time in a marathon, shaving off more than an hour from his finish time. Seriously?Read Post | Comments (597)Leo W. Gerard, 09/03/12International President, United SteelworkersPresident Obama made no claim that he built that by himself. On Labor Day, he recognizes the contributions union and non-union workers made to building this great country. All Americans built that.Read Post | Comments (208)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 09/01/12Author, research psychologist, and gender expertAs parents, our responsibility is to keep kids unharmed.

Granholm, 09/01/12Former governor of Michigan; Host, \u0027The War Room\u0027 on Current TV; columnist, Politico; faculty member, UC BerkeleyThis past week, self-glorification trumped common national vision. The \"I\" conquered the \"we.\" Next week Democrats have to boldly counter this anti-\"we\" zeal. We want you, Mr. President, to remind us that we are part of something bigger.Read Post | Comments (444)Jared Bernstein, 09/03/12Senior Fellow, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesI know who\u0027s fighting for wealthy people, for the finance industry, for the oil companies. I can see who\u0027s fighting for the troops and even for the poor, though the latter are surely harder to find than the rest. But who\u0027s fighting for working people?Read Post | Comments (58)Diana Nyad, 09/01/12Long-distance swimmer, journalist, and broadcasterToday would have been my brother\u0027s 60th birthday.

For Arab Americans, with our record breaking numbers, it will represent a \"coming of age.\" Our hard work has brought us from exclusion to being respected and recognized as part of the mainstream of the Democratic Party.Read Post | Comments (262)Glenn W. Smith and James Moore, 09/03/12We are in an extreme circumstance in which one candidate\u0027s strategy includes the manipulation of voting procedures to disenfranchise a significant segment of qualified American voters. Are there any circumstances under which an American election outcome would be considered illegitimate?Read Post | Comments (164)Nate Leonard, 09/03/12Center, University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) FootballIf the thud of the blocked field goal in last year\u0027s game haunted my once peaceful dreams, I couldn\u0027t imagine what it must have done for the guy who kicked it. This week during practice, I jokingly asked our kicker Sean if he wanted the game to come down to a field goal again. He smiled.Read Post | CommentsDevon Corneal, 09/03/12Lawyer, MotherIn a nod toward the return to routine, classrooms and homework, this month\u0027s book suggestions are geared toward making learning a little more fun.Read Post | CommentsMichelangelo Signorile, 09/03/12Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesNo one uttered the word \"gay\" from the podium, nor did anyone want to want to speak about the issue when asked. But no one ever attained their civil rights from being quiet. Keep your hugs and kisses. Just give me full equality.Read Post | Comments (154)Joe Hansen, 09/03/12International President, United Food and Commercial Workers UnionThis Labor Day, Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan will pay lip service to America\u0027s workers and talk about their plans to strengthen the middle class. But instead of offering any serious solutions, they have made it clear that they are planning to balance the budget on the backs of America\u0027s workers and the poor.Read Post | Comments (16)Bill Santiago, 09/02/12Comedian; TV Host/Commentator; Author, \u0027Pardon My Spanglish\u0027He\u0027s pro-gay marriage, pro-choice, pro-getting out of Afghanistan, pro-auto bailout, and apparently pro-not combing your hair after a nap. I have no idea why he\u0027s so anti-chair.Read Post | Comments (122)Richard Klass, 09/01/12Colonel, USAF (ret.)You would think Romney might acknowledge that we still have a war going on in Afghanistan and that young Americans are still dying there. Before Romney can claim to be a qualified Commander in Chief, he needs to talk to the troops and the vets.Read Post | Comments (247)Rev.

My pick: the head of his national security brain trust, former World Bank chief Robert Zoellick, followed by Romney\u0027s lead foreign policy speechwriter (whoever that is).Read Post | Comments (52)Amelia, 08/29/12Mother, wife, partner, and breadwinnerWhen my 7-year-old son announced to us that he is gay, the last thing I thought about was television. But as he has continued to hold firm to this identity, I have become aware of the lack of gay characters in the television shows and movies he likes to watch.Read Post | Comments (368)Randi Weingarten, 09/01/12President, American Federation of TeachersLabor Day means many things to many people -- back to school, the end of summer, a needed respite from the daily grind.
