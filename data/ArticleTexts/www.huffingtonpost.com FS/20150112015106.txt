{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week all eyes were on Paris as the murderous shooting at the offices of the French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo, which left 12 dead, culminated in two simultaneous hostage crises in which the Hedbo attackers and four hostages were killed. These heinous attacks were, in essence, aimed at tolerance, openness, dialogue, and diversity -- and are more a test of our commitment to our most bedrock principles than a test of our security capabilities. The way to pass this test is by refusing to compromise those core values. I\u0027d also like to salute our colleagues at Le Huffington Post in Paris, who did a stellar job covering the tragic and rapidly shifting story. It\u0027s been a grim few days, but as today\u0027s march of solidarity in Paris will no doubt show, what unites us is much more powerful than the forces of division and intolerance.The French are right to insist that there is a \"third way\" between an endless war on terrorists and a rigid adherence to normal legal standards when confronting a wave of terrorist attacks.Professor of law and political science, Yale; Author \u0027The Decline and Fall of the American Republic\u0027Keep going. Fight back. Draw. Laugh at everything. That\u0027s what the Charlie journalists did, and that\u0027s what we need to do in order to show the victims that we continue to admire their talent and their commitment to freedom.Editorial Director, Le Huffington PostDo we want to live in a country where expert reviews don\u0027t matter and industry profits trump our families\u0027 health? Do we want to lock ourselves into a fuel that generates 17 percent more climate change pollution than crude oil and makes our children more vulnerable to extreme weather? Or do we want something better?Actor, director and environmental activistMr. Fahmy has been imprisoned for over a year in a case that shocks the conscience of many observers in Egypt and abroad. We look forward to working constructively with the Egyptian and Canadian authorities in the coming days to reach an agreement for his release as soon as possible.LawyerLawyerWhile we\u0027ve heard pro-fracking propaganda before from the Obama administration, many Americans have had enough of it and I\u0027m one of them. In 2008, I voted for \u0027Hope and Change,\u0027 but we are not getting the change we hoped for.Oscar-nominated actor, climate change activistThe Prophet and the majority of Muslims around the world were betrayed by those who claim to hold Islam as their religion and use it for their own political gains. Shame on them.Award-winning Egyptian-American journalist and writerIf Charlie Hebdo were to close because of this senseless, horrific massacre, then we\u0027re all lessened by its loss. The magazine stands for a lot more than just a few thousand subscribers and a few uncomfortable French politicians. It stands for the ability of humanity to transcend its darkest impulses.Associate Professor of Journalism and New Media at Baylor University and founder of the Black Gospel Music Restoration Project.There\u0027s more happening here, and it comes down to the fact that Paltrow\u0027s a woman. How often do we see male celebrities, or men in general, tasked for the stuff-- whether vain or frivolous or \"too indulgent\"-- they spend their money on?Author, research psychologist and gender scholarThe change we are asking for will inevitably happen. The only question is when. And for that we turn to you. Governor Cuomo, the floor is yours.Founder, GlobalGrind.comPreventing these catastrophes will involve sustained and dedicated effort by all those who truly care about the future of humanity. But it will also require deconstructing and exposing the futuristic fantasies deployed by the fossil fuel companies to perpetuate their dominance.Author and Professor of Peace and World-Security Studies, Hampshire CollegeDuring the debate over health care reform, we often heard that health care is a basic human right. That\u0027s true -- and just as true is the fact that women have the basic human right to safe, legal abortion care.President, National Organization for WomenHere is the awful math of New Year\u0027s resolutions. By the time you read this, there is a roughly 25 percent chance that you have given up. Already. After nine days.Senior Financial Writer, The Huffington PostUp until last year, insurance companies could -- and often did -- charge women different premiums than men for the same coverage. As of January 1, 2014, the ACA prohibits this gender discrimination.Senior Advisor to the President and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsAmong the extremist connections to terrorist brothers Cheriff, 32, and Said Kouachi, 34, are fellow radical French Algerians as well as those in Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversitySince September 11, Americans in particular -- though not only -- have supported politicians and opinion-mongers in pivoting their geo-politics and world views on isolated, spectacular, terrible acts by terrible people.Professor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027If you take nothing else away, I\u0027ve boiled it down to this: Tune out all the judgment, trust yourself, try not to worry so much, laugh, give yourself a break, be flexible and don\u0027t Google anything!Director, Strategic Partnerships + Audience Development at the Huffington PostOnce again many in the media have fallen for GOP strategists\u0027 attempts to make a candidate seem moderate -- \"soften\" and \"softening\" seem to be the words of choice for CNN and others -- while he\u0027s not changed his hardcore right-wing position at all.Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesRepublican opponents of Social Security have not wasted even a single day in their plan to dismantle Social Security brick by brick. What should be a dry, mundane exercise -- the adoption of new rules by the newly convening House of Representatives -- has turned into a stealth attack on America\u0027s working families.Founding Co-director, Social Security WorksProfessor of Social Work, Syracuse UniversityLas Vegas Sun’s editorial cartoonistIt is striking that on their first day -- their very first day! -- congressional Republicans moved against Social Security\u0027s disability insurance fund, before some of them had even found the restrooms or put out their family photos. As Jerry Seinfeld might ask, \"Who does that?\"Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourEveryone has a natural body type. Yet the paradox of society is inescapable: Don\u0027t be too skinny, but don\u0027t be too large either. Talking with my friend that day reminded me that people\u0027s eyes are on you either way, although you\u0027ve done nothing to deserve their admiration or distaste.Author, actress, fairytale dreamer. Her debut memoir will help those with eating disorders attain happiness and freedom.Cartoonist and bloggerFor decades, Americans have been trapped in the boom-bust cycle of resource extraction. Approving Keystone XL will further bind America to an industry that is rapidly losing ground to more sensible and sustainable energy solutions.Dean of the US House of Representatives | Ranking Member, House Judiciary CommitteeAs 2015 begins, let\u0027s take a trip down memory lane. Imagine that it\u0027s January 1963. Perhaps that American visitor from 1963 would already feel as if his or her mind were being scrambled like a morning egg and yet we\u0027re only beginning.Editor, TomDispatch.comThe thinness I\u0027d achieved came with its own brand of indignity. It was the fear of gaining back each pound, of proving myself a fail­ure, that plagued me. It was the fatness of my shadow that followed me into the dark alley of an eating disorder.Author of It Was Me All AlongNaysayers will claim there is no money on the federal or state level to support the president\u0027s plan. But we must go beyond viewing free community college as a handout and rather see it as an investment in our country\u0027s future.President of Ivy Tech Community CollegeLet\u0027s take the traditional resolutions that focus on the personal (and often, the physical) and translate them into goals that go beyond self-improvement to create lasting change for ourselves, other women, and the world.President, Barbara Lee Political Office and Barbara Lee Family Foundation2014 was a bad year for children and education.Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationAs a nation it\u0027s time to close our hypocrisy gap in the treatment of our children and value and protect our children -- all of them. We need to examine with urgency how we treat our children and the gap between what we say and what we do.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundLittle brothers aren\u0027t supposed to die. This is something you know as a child without someone telling you. Little brothers, the ones who are a foot taller than you and who smile with their eyes, do not die at age 30. But heroin addicts do.Mother, Writer, Student.
