{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editorial Director, Huffington Post Media GroupIt\u0027s almost Biden Time, a more urgent campaign moment than he or anyone else could have imagined a few days ago. After a political career that has lasted 42 years so far, the genial vice president and former senator faces the most critical task of his electoral life: helping his boss dig out of the avalanche that buried him in Denver. At 69 years of age and heading towards the twilight of his time on the stage, Joe Biden on Thursday will confront Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who has been on Earth only six years longer (42) than the number of years Biden served as a U.S. senator from Delaware (36).

We welcome him back not as a comedian whose material has gotten better with age -- or one recovering from a period of decline -- but as we would a 90s time capsule.Read Post | Comments (294)John Tirman, 10/08/12Executive Director, MIT Center for International StudiesRomney\u0027s foibles as a foreign policy candidate are plentiful and easy targets.

Swanee Hunt, 10/08/12Accepting the trafficking of women and girls as a norm coarsens our culture.
