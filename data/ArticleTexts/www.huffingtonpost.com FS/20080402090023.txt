Being such an America\u0027s American, it\u0027s astonishing that he\u0027d be so willing to repeatedly grovel at the feet of this regime -- especially on issues that represent his various breads and butters. If McCain were the growling, hardtack-eating American he claims to be, he never would have made peace with the Bush administration. A man of McCain\u0027s media-and-BBQ-ribs-backed maverick swagger should have opposed the Bush White House every step of the way... simply on principle.Read Post | CommentsBIOLionel Beehner, 04.02.2008We are bent on recklessly expanding NATO, without giving much afterthought to its overarching mission statement.Read Post | CommentsBIOFrank Schaeffer, 04.02.2008What if the Bush error is so big there can be no happy endings? In this sense McCain\u0027s personal experiences would work against our country.Read Post | Comments (220)BIOJesse Ventura, 04.02.2008I knew that Bush had a good sense of humor from a governors\u0027 meeting in 2001. But my first inclination that he was not a man of his word came from that same meeting.Read Post | Comments (65)BIORep. Hilda L. Solis, 04.02.2008Cesar Chavez\u0027s work inspired me to find ways to help others and led me to civil service and I believe it\u0027s important to preserve his memory for future generations.Read Post | CommentsBIODavid McWilliams, 04.02.2008Paulson\u0027s ideas are nothing short of a reverse \"Robin Hood\" scenario where the poor are being robbed to pay for the rich, so that the rich need not pay for their own mistakes.Read Post | Comments (17)BIONeil Grossman, 04.02.2008One of the factors, according to Bernanke, in deciding to \"rescue\" Bear Stearns was the possibility that they might file Chapter 11. Because of this, I am thinking of filing Chapter 11 too.Read Post | CommentsBIODee Dee Myers, 04.02.2008Fuzzy math--that staple of previous presidential campaigns--is back. And this time, it has mostly to do with the Clinton campaign\u0027s methodology for counting delegates and votes.Read Post | Comments (152)BIOArt Brodsky, 04.02.2008If there\u0027s anything better than a simple April Fool\u0027s prank, it\u0027s a more complex one that also has a second act -- a delayed reaction that puts the joke into a larger context or proper perspective.Read Post | CommentsBIOGreg Mitchell, 04.02.2008The media, with months to plan for the five-year commemoration of the war, were ready to take stock of everything but themselves.Read Post | Comments (25)BIOChip Collis, 04.02.2008Consider Hillary\u0027s half-court strategy. Drawn up on the DLC-chalkboard, it consists of anchoring the major blue states, conceding the basic red states, and fighting over the swing states.Read Post | Comments (21)BIORobert Scheer, 04.02.2008Rarely does the plug get pulled on even the most irrelevant and expensive war toy. Not while both Democratic and Republican politicians feed at the same trough.Read Post | Comments (98)BIORick Jacobs, 04.02.2008Conventions should energize, organize and highlight. They should not be a filter to prevent the people from electing leaders, and they certainly should not be an incumbency protection racket.Read Post | Comments (58)Chris Kelly, 04.01.2008Daniel Nichanian, 04.02.2008Huff TV, 04.02.2008Henry Blodget, 04.02.2008Stephen Schlesinger, 04.02.2008Sen.
