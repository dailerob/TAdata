{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranIt\u0027s entirely obvious now that the Iraq War was a horrible deal for the U.S, the thousands of lives we lost, and the thousands more who came home wounded and maimed, inside and out. Jeb dishonored all of them with his recent comments. If Jeb truly thinks that it was a \"good deal\" for us, then he also must be lying when he says that he wouldn\u0027t have launched the war in Iraq, knowing then what we do now. After all, if what we know now is that we ended up with a \"good deal,\" then of course he\u0027d do it all over again. Yet, in the debate and his speech this week, he went through great pains to say he\u0027d avoid the war in Iraq. They say a gaffe is when a politician tells you what they really think. I\u0027ve never seen a clearer example of that, than in Jeb\u0027s latest comment. The truth of the matter is that Jeb Bush has no idea what he\u0027s talking about. None.After 50 years of stagnation, the sense of progress and potential is real. We are under no illusions that Cuba will be transformed overnight, and we are clear-eyed about the challenges ahead. Among these is Cuba\u0027s continued denial of universal human rights.U.S. Secretary of StateThough I am invisible to you, others, many others, see me and see the injustice that I have endured for a very long time. Have you not read the editorials, articles and commentaries? I am now in prison for a crime I did not commit.Lawyer and former CIA case officerExactly how Top Secret/SCI information wound up on Hillary Clinton\u0027s private server is a critical question and one likely to lead to the downfall of some assistants and possibly Clinton herself.Professor of International and Public Affairs at the Arnold A. Saltzman Institute of War \u0026 Peace Studies at Columbia UniversityTo create true change involves disrupting the current systems that seek to oppress, and true allies and accomplices understand that to create equity means a willingness to give up something for the good of all. Anything less is empty words and more of the same.Founder, Black Girl in Maine; Executive Director, Community Change IncWith the recent crisis in our nation surrounding police impropriety, violence and even murder, is our nation ready for the re-popularization of the music that gave us the \"F-ck The Police!\" chant?Founder One Church LA, Executive Director of Artist Resource Center (ARC)Those who are fortunate enough to live to old age need steady, guaranteed income that they cannot outlive. Social Security provides protection in all three eventualities - death, disability, and old age.Founding Co-director, Social Security WorksWhere are the neighbors? Where are the schools and community organizations? Who reaches out to see what the problem is? Does anyone see this child/youth desperately in need of help and hope? Who listens or offers a helping hand amidst the violence and despair they face daily?President, Children\u0027s Defense FundOne of the biggest sources of that doubt about women\u0027s abilities comes from women themselves. The next time you shy away from a promotion or an opportunity in favor of sticking with what you know or what you\u0027ve been told you\u0027re good at, reconsider. Knowing what works can be comfortable. It can also be an easy way to go nowhere.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarA campaign by Book Soup, one of LA\u0027s last remaining independent bookstores, to put Joan Didion on the ten dollar bill reminds just how influential writers and bookstores can be.Culture Columnist, Huffington Post, CultureZohnEvery generation has worked to strengthen and expand the program to keep that promise. Now it is our turn to do the same.U.S. Senator from HawaiiThe words \"FBI\" and \"Justice Department\" should never be associated with a presidential campaign. Record crowds of enthusiastic supporters, totaling around 100,000 people in various states, should be associated with a presidential campaign.Columnist and author published in The Hill, The Baltimore Sun, The Jerusalem Post, Salon www.hagoodman.comLast night, while I was casually cooking dinner, something rather unbelievable happened. A cat I\u0027d fostered earlier this year appeared, miaowing, at my open kitchen window - having taken three weeks to travel all the way across London, from his new home in Brixton to my flat in Kilburn.Blogs Editor of The Huffington Post UKTo campaign against Social Security is to court political suicide. (It certainly didn\u0027t help Alf Landon; he was trounced.) It therefore becomes imperative to convince voters instead that the program is unreliable. That\u0027s the Republican strategy.WriterIt\u0027s a story so awful that even though my job involves constantly reading news about drug war atrocities, I avoided this one for days.Managing Director of Communications, Drug Policy AllianceMoral outrage is timeless. The BLM Movement needs to decide whether its principal strategic objective is to defeat, embarrass, or publicly disrupt the campaigns of those candidates running for president of the United States; or, instead, to engage them as a potential allies in its struggle to get our nation to finally acknowledge, 24/7, that Black Lives really Matter.Diversity Visiting Professor, University of San Francisco; and Scholar Writer in Residence, MLK, Jr. Institute, Stanford UniversityAs advocates for economic justice, we should celebrate this event and its enduring legacy while striving to make UI work better for today\u0027s workers. Sensible steps at both the state and federal levels can help ensure that UI lasts well into the next century.Senior Staff Attorney, National Employment Law ProjectThe people of the region opposing and ready to fight ISIS and their allies, including the United States, must demonstrate a clear and consistent moral basis in all of their acts. We cannot fight ISIS while routinely killing civilians in the process.Foreign Policy In Focus (FPIF) columnistDan Bidondi Freaks Out Over Mandatory HPV Vaccines; Trump Goes to War Against Rand Paul; and much more.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027The future and the past are never far apart in modern Asia, where both the Middle Kingdom and the Land of the Rising Sun are, as never before, great powers at the same time. This week, on the 70th anniversary of Japan\u0027s defeat in World War II, tensions simmered as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe once again stopped short of an apology for suffering Japan inflicted on innocent people. Meanwhile, a newly assertive China prepares for a reportedly unprecedented military display to mark the formal end of the war in early September.After repeated calls from the International Monetary Fund and the U.S. Treasury to let the market determine exchange rates, China this week devalued its currency. That, in turn, set off fears of beggar-thy-neighbor currency wars in a slack global economy. Taking this sudden move now, even as state intervention continues to prop up China\u0027s ailing stock market, has shaken confidence in the Communist Party\u0027s lauded ability to master events. (continued)I had never encountered such a depth of ugliness until I observed others on a quest for superficial beauty. I was beginning to feel as though I was witnessing zombies walking straight into the mouth of a giant, black hole.

The way in which you deal with such differences defines you as a \"knower\" or a \"learner.\" Knowers claim to know how things are, how they ought to be, and what needs to be done.

I\u0027m not even actually white!\" I thought triumphantly. \"My mom is Dutch-Indonesian!
