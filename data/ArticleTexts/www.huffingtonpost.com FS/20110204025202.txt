{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Scholar in Residence at the University of ColoradoThere is a good chance that we are now entering a rare cycle of history in the Middle East, with autocracies giving way to fragile democracies that in turn will evolve into radical fundamentalist regimes. For the world\u0027s greatest superpower, this is a quandary, compounded by the fact that we depend on that region for a quarter of our oil imports. If we truly mean to stand on the principles embodied in our Constitution, we are going to have to do better than this.Read Post | CommentsSimon Jenkins, 02.03.2011Writer for the Guardian and the London Sunday TimesWe are hypocrites. We cheer on the brave Tunisians and Egyptians as they assert the revolutionary power of the street. Hands off, we cry. Let them do it their way. We gave no such license to the Iraqis or Afghans.Read Post | CommentsJoel Simon, 02.03.2011Executive Director, Committee to Protect JournalistsStanding up for the rights of journalists may be our last, best hope of stemming an impending bloodbath that could go down in history as the gravest example of political repression.Read Post | CommentsJoe Cirincione, 02.03.2011President of Ploughshares FundOne of Ronald Reagan\u0027s most powerful and living legacies was his dream of a world free of nuclear weapons.

The answer is not at all clear.Read Post | CommentsRep. Howard L.

When he\u0027s on stage, he\u0027s in a sense deceiving his friends in the audience less than he does in daily life, because on stage he\u0027s disclosing the parts of himself that in daily life he struggles to hide.Read Post | CommentsAndy Borowitz, 02.03.2011Comedian and creator of BorowitzReport.comIn the days since it became clear that Mr. Mubarak did not receive the White House\u0027s initial message, Mr. Obama has been huddling with advisers to discuss a range of more drastic options, including changing the message\u0027s font altogether.Read Post | CommentsPhil Bronstein, 02.03.2011Executive Vice President and Editor-at-Large, San Francisco ChronicleWhy is Mr. Obama not paying attention to the Philippine piece of the Reagan legacy that we\u0027ll call \"dealing effectively with a dictator who\u0027s lost his grip?\"Read Post | CommentsDaniel Krotz, 02.03.2011Writer and bookseller living in the Ozark Mountains of rural ArkansasFrom 1995 to 2009, taxpayers shelled out nearly a quarter-trillion dollars in farm subsidies.

Popular mobilization that was admirable in its pluralism and discipline will find it much harder to resist the impulse toward violence in response.Read Post | CommentsDoug Lansky, 02.03.2011Travel writer based in StockholmRead Post | CommentsScott Atran, 02.03.2011Anthropologist; Author, \u0027Talking to the Enemy: Faith, Brotherhood, and the (Un)Making of Terrorists\u0027There is little reason for the U.S. to fear a takeover by the Muslim Brotherhood.
