{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostIt\u0027s true that Hillary Clinton, as secretary of state, gave an important, groundbreaking speech in Geneva in 2011, pronouncing that LGBT rights are human rights, taking on brutal anti-LGBT regimes abroad. But that was then, and while we all deeply care about our brothers and sisters overseas, there is so much that needs to be done in the U.S. for LGBT people that an American presidential candidate could promise right now. At a time when Clinton\u0027s Democratic rivals are exploiting a dip in her approval numbers, Clinton should be going on the offensive as the candidate fighting for full equality. It\u0027s baffling that Clinton hasn\u0027t done this considering the full force with which she\u0027s taken on the issue of immigration and the way she took on the voting rights issue Thursday.World leaders simply cannot dodge the issue of corruption any longer. We have to show some of the same courage that exposed Fifa and break the taboo on talking about this problem. I will start tomorrow at the G7 in Germany and I will put corruption at the heart of my agenda at the United Nations in September and the G20 in Turkey, culminating with a major anti-corruption Summit in London next year.Prime Minister of the United KingdomShould Americans join the military if the next commander-in-chief of the armed services is an arrogant, ignorant, irresponsible, war-happy hawk? Many of America\u0027s best and brightest join the armed services. But with the U.S. constantly at war, joining is a life or death decision, dependent on the judgment of whoever sits in the Oval Office.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteIn August 1998, in what was my last meeting with Tariq Aziz as a weapons inspector, he lambasted the lack of progress after more than seven years of inspections. \"The truth is that Iraq has no proscribed weapons or capabilities in any areas within the mandate of the Special Commission... Your duty is to take the direct political responsibility and report the truth.\"Author, \u0027Dangerous Ground\u0027In many corners we hear the same old exhortation that the way to fix poverty and anything else that ails Americans is for us to become a nation of Good Samaritans. But has giving a beggar a coin ever been as effective as creating an economy that provides him or her a good education and a job?President, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe Dominican Republic has actually tortured its own constitution, and a host of human rights laws to persecute the poorest of its citizens. You see, in the Dominican case, the country has used anti-immigrant rhetoric against its own racial minority citizens. But they are not immigrants!Professor of Law, Florida International UniversityMariel Hemingway is the granddaughter of one of America\u0027s greatest writers Ernest Hemingway.

Otherwise the border communities CBP serves will continue to question whether unjustified Border Patrol violence ever has consequences.Policy Counsel, ACLU Washington Legislative OfficeI don\u0027t know what\u0027s worse: the fact that Creflo Dollar believes God spoke to him and told him to buy this jet, or the fact that people are so gullible and delusional and are actually supporting this guy.Author and expert in the field of critical thinking and mental toughness trainingYesterday, in a speech in Texas on the importance of voting rights, Hillary Clinton made one of the most important remarks of her campaign so far: \"We need a Supreme Court who cares more about the right to vote of a person than the right to buy an election of a corporation.\"Director of Communications, People For the American WayThose who doubt the wisdom of Saudi Arabia\u0027s decision to launch a bombing campaign against Iranian proxies in March of this year are ubiquitous. Except in Saudi Arabia, that is.Vice President for Research, Foundation for Defense of DemocraciesJune is Gay Pride Month. It is a time for parades and for festivals, for rainbow flags and for dance tents. It is a time to recognize the amazing progress that has been made on LGBT equality as we recommit ourselves to continuing the struggle until liberty and justice for all really means \"all.\"Episcopal priest and activist from Pasadena, Calif.Even with pretty amazing technology at our disposal, dreams -- their function, their purpose -- remain relatively little understood. The study of dreams through brain accidents, abnormalities, and disease will likely continue to be a source of new details that enrich our knowledge of this most mysterious aspect of life.Clinical Psychologist; Board Certified Sleep SpecialistActually, it wasn\u0027t at all what I thought it would be like. I\u0027ve now been practicing yoga regularly for almost two years, and while I continue to discover more about myself (and my practice) with each class, these are the eight things I wish had known before spending more time on the mat.In the face of continued apathy, anger, injustice, inequality and discrimination, there was more pragmatism on stage at the Personal Democracy Forum this year than in years past.Senior Editor for Technology and Society, The Huffington Post.When we keep stress in the closet, we aren\u0027t doing ourselves any favors.

However, some of us believe in living a life full of passion -- a life where you never feel bored, stagnant, or stuck -- a life where you\u0027re constantly excited and inspired.Founder of The Happiness Planner. Check out her blog at BrandMentalist.comThe good people of Dusseldorf, Germany, and specifically the IKB Bank, which specializes in loans to small and medium-size businesses, has kindly endowed Harvard University\u0027s engineering school with a gift of $400m. Strangely, though, the Harvard Engineering School was renamed after hedge-fund manager John A. Paulson, not IKB, and thereby hangs a tale.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia UniversityThe NYT\u0027s headline is written to pin her driving record on him. Headlines matter -- that is what most people read and then stop. Collapsing the two driving records in that one headline smears the candidate. She is the one with the driving problem -- 13 violations to his four.Host, Fox News\u0027 \u0027On the Record With Greta Van Susteren\u0027To my great sadness, the modern conservative movement has devolved into something quite different from the kind of Bob Dole conservatism I grew up around. It\u0027s not necessarily more conservative, mostly just a whole lot meaner.
