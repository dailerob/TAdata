{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Robert F. Kennedy Jr.President, Waterkeeper Alliance; Senior Attorney, NRDCMy uncle, President John F. Kennedy\u0027s Pulitzer Prize winning best-seller Profiles in Courage recounted the stories of courageous U.S. Senators -- Republicans and Democrats -- who chose patriotism over partisanship and sacrificed personal ambition to national welfare. The GOP\u0027s recent efforts to gin up presidential scandals in punitive hearings, media lynchings, and weekly calls for impeachment, evince a party-wide pathology that puts partisanship over patriotism. For Republicans who believe that patriotism ends with lapel pins and cowboy costumes, it might be useful to consider some historical examples of true patriotism by a political party.Recently, a somewhat obscure scientific journal rejected a paper. Somehow, that made the front page of the London Times and spawned a number of articles in the right-wing press. How in the world does a rejected manuscript warrant front-page media coverage? Here\u0027s how.Michael E. MannDirector of Penn State Earth System Science Center; Author of \u0027Dire Predictions\u0027 and \u0027The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars\u0027Americans face a genuine dilemma. If they are truly committed to equality of opportunity, then they will have to demand vigorous measures to reduce the drastic levels of inequality that now divide the nation.Jerome KarabelProfessor of Sociology, University of California at BerkeleyThe truth is that pro-gun activists don\u0027t want any laws or regulations on firearms, regardless of the intent of the law.Mike WeisserMike the Gun GuyVoices across the country are raising concerns about the new Common Core State Standards. But if you listen carefully to the conversations, the main concern is not about the standards, themselves, but about the consequences of high-stakes tests attached to the standards. And those concerns are well-placed.Randi WeingartenPresident, American Federation of TeachersAs Europe\u0027s depression continues six years after the financial collapse of 2007-2008, watch for far-right parties to make big gains in this week\u0027s elections to the EU\u0027s European Parliament. And why not?Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Educational inequality isn\u0027t a notion from the past; it is happening right now all across this nation. And the facts simply don\u0027t lie.Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkI\u0027m not used to expressing my personal feelings here, but as \"Simone\" is a character that is meant to represent me in Welcome to New York, I would simply like to say how disgusted I am.Anne SinclairEditorial Director, Le Huffington PostWe\u0027re are at a crucial moment where the ability of technology to permit instant, unvetted and unfiltered commentary is running head-first into the justified concerns of those whose reputations can be torn asunder unfairly by it. It\u0027s a conundrum for sure and one that needs some serious sorting out.William D. CohanAuthor, \u0027The Price of Silence\u0027I wasn\u0027t exactly surprised when the email came from Joyce and Kevin Lucey. They\u0027ve been sending emails like this for years, recounting what the Veterans Administration is -- and, more often, isn\u0027t -- doing to help veterans flailing about in search of care.Nan Levinson\u0027War Is Not a Game: The New Antiwar Soldiers and the Movement They Built\u0027 will be out in the fallTreating babies with stimulants is based on no research, is reckless and takes no account of the possible harmful long-term effects of bathing baby brains with powerful neurotransmitter drugs.Allen FrancesProfessor Emeritus, Duke UniversityThe claim that dozens of men at Guantanamo cannot be tried in the United States and are also too dangerous to release to another country is just not plausible. It\u0027s a claim we wouldn\u0027t accept from any other country, and we shouldn\u0027t get comfortable with it in the United States, either.Daphne EviatarSenior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstWhen Wake Forest University invited Jill Abramson to speak at today\u0027s graduation, they didn\u0027t know they\u0027d tacitly be taking sides in her punching match with New York Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger, Jr. But I bet Rutgers\u0027 powers-that-be knew what they were doing when they invited Rice to commencement.Marty KaplanUSC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorFor nearly 35 years, David Suzuki has brought science into the homes of millions on the Canadian television series, The Nature of Things. He has become a godfather of the environmental movement, and in a poll of his fellow Canadians last fall he was named that country\u0027s most admired figure.Bill MoyersManaging Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyEventually, your loving husband, whom you had specifically banned from taking breastfeeding pictures, the one you had forced to delete any pictures that showed any area of your breasts, sends you this amazing photo.Sandy RoffeyWriter, mother, former educator, milk addict enabler.A specter is haunting Washington, an unnerving vision of a Sino-Russian alliance wedded to an expansive symbiosis of trade and commerce across much of the Eurasian land mass -- at the expense of the United States.Pepe EscobarRoving correspondent for the Asia TimesAs I geared up for the battle of my life, my husband started demonstrating a lack of willingness to fight by my side.Fiona FinnAuthor, mother, cancer survivorIs it a good idea to warn students that a given work might be upsetting? Absolutely. That\u0027s just good pedagogical practice. The real question is whether institutions should be mandating formal trigger warnings on syllabi and before showing potentially objectionable films.Gary A. OlsonPresident, Daemen College; ColumnistAs a high school teacher and professor I\u0027ve often dreamt of having my own high school, one designed in the spirit of all of my ideas about what education should and shouldn\u0027t be. My pretend school is called the Progressive Institute of Student Awesomeness (PISA).Chris GoeringAssociate Professor of English Education, University of Arkansas; Blogger, EduSanityReflecting on the nearly 13 years that have passed since Congress voted for the AUMF, the warning bells that few were ringing now appear prescient. In addition to providing the president the authority to wage war against anyone, anywhere, at any time, the single sentence of the AUMF serves as the legal justification for some of the most troubling U.S. policies.Rep. Barbara LeeU.S. Representative, California\u0027s 13th congressional districtThis is something I have never talked about publicly. Five years ago, shortly after my beautiful daughter\u0027s third birthday, I was diagnosed with advanced SWS -- Shit Writing Syndrome.Andy BobrowTelevision writerWe are raising a generation of chronically sleep-deprived, anxious, caffeine-addled kids who believe that grades, rankings, AP and SAT scores, and -- of course -- college admissions are the ultimate measure of their worth.Vicki AbelesDirector, Race to NowhereMany Americans believe that the top one percent is responsible for the rising tide of inequality in America, which is swamping and drowning the other 99 percent. Professor Emmanuel Saez of the University of California at Berkeley says that they are wrong.Rep. Alan GraysonU.S. Congressman for Florida\u0027s 9th DistrictKicking it in a brewpub or in line at a beer fest can feel like being in a weird, foreign country full of bearded dudes speaking a completely different language.ThrillistEverything worth caring about in food, drink, and travelSeveral recent studies have indicated that the human reviewer -- if/when they do actually see your resume -- will spend fewer than 10 seconds looking at it before deciding whether or not you are qualified for the opportunity.Susan P. JoyceOnline job search expert, Job - Hunt.org writerI sat there alone on the cold ground for the next 15 minutes quietly taking notice of every little thing. It\u0027s a memory and image I can still recall with vivid detail to this day. It never got any likes and no one knows what it looked like, but I don\u0027t care. I like it better that way.Braden S. ThompsonWriter and advocate for better livingThese days, it\u0027s becoming more and more impossible to define \u0027normal.\u0027 That\u0027s a good thing. Most children have friends or neighbors whose families aren\u0027t exactly -- or, in some cases, remotely -- like their own.Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarIn 1954, Brown v. Board may have seemed like the end of a long struggle for educational equality. In fact, it was the beginning. We face a lot of challenges today in our communities, our country and on our planet.Sec. Arne DuncanU.S. Secretary of EducationDance, when no one is looking. Then, if no one was looking, videotape it, upload it onto YouTube, use the ensuing traffic to establish a platform from which you can leverage yourself into a six-figure deal for a reality show based on your dancing at which no one was looking.Ian LendlerIan Lendler is the author of the Stratford Zoo series of graphic novels. You can see his books at ianlendler.com.It is hard to be optimistic about a future world where there is a low-powered free and open Internet and a web of private toll roads owned by non-governmental organizations that inherently compete with their customers.Shelly PalmerHost, Shelly Palmer Digital LivingThe death of the American steel industry is fine with the likes of the Wall Street Journal, Forbes and the Cato Institute. They say Americans should thank foreign states that violate international trade laws by subsidizing their steel industries.Leo W.
