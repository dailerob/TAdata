{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Linda BergtholdHealth policy researcherWho would have thought that once the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare) was deemed constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court and ratified by the 2012 election, we would still have a vocal minority of Republicans demanding its repeal (and shutting down the government over it)? But that\u0027s exactly where we are. A surprising proportion of the American public still believes some astonishing lies about this law, and new lies are surfacing every day. The viral emails still exist and continue to circulate. This is a post about what you should believe about the ACA, how implementation is going, and what the law is actually doing.CommentsTEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"New York Times personal tech columnist David Pogue shares ten easy shortcuts that cut down on the time it takes to compose a text message, fill out an online form, and complete other everyday tasks.Comments (26)Paul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostThe themes and speakers at VVS2013 have the whiff of decayed ideas and diminished power. But the really horrible part of the event is the complete and utter lack of interest in the poor, the immigrants, and those on the margins -- you know, those people Jesus loved.Comments (143)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundExtremist Republicans continue to hold funding for the federal government hostage for the second week in a row, opposing a clean extension of government funding without conditions. Their actions are harming the economy and countless real children and families across the country.CommentsJane HortonMilitary and political consultant, and proud Gold Star wife to SPC Christopher Horton, an Army sniper killed in action on September 9, 2011 in Paktyia, AfghanistanOften, we forget about our most sacred and vulnerable population -- those that have given the biggest part of them to the cause of freedom. Maybe it\u0027s time that our nation takes a cold hard look itself. Who are we? Who have we become?CommentsDylan RatiganNew York Times Best-Selling author, entrepreneur and formerly the host of MSNBC\u0027s The Dylan Ratigan ShowI have always believed that the size of the problem equals the size of the opportunity. And considering the obvious size of the problem presented by opaque election financing and extractive core systems, massive opportunities for reform surely surround us.CommentsRobert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The radicals who tried to hijack America didn\u0027t understand one very basic thing.

We are no longer the wonder of the world. We exposed our ignorance, our ugly insensitivity. We are a petty people with a government that has ceased to function.CommentsRep. Keith EllisonCo-chair, Congressional Progressive Caucus; U.S. Representative for Minnesota\u0027s 5th DistrictIt takes 86 hours a week working in a minimum wage job to pay for an average two-bedroom apartment in Minnesota. That\u0027s 12 hours a day, seven days a week. It\u0027s no accident that real wages have declined while executive pay and corporate profits have climbed rapidly.CommentsRichard ParkerLecturer in Public Policy and Senior Fellow of the Shorenstein Center, Harvard Kennedy SchoolHere\u0027s my down-the-middle solution to the shutdown, which I offer as a professional economist: Suspend Obamacare and cut the budget -- just as House Republicans have demanded -- but do all the cutting in just the 80 or so congressional districts of the most ardent Tea Party members.CommentsArianna HuffingtonAs hotels vie for supremacy in what some industry insiders refer to as the \"battle of the beds,\" many are rethinking their priorities, knowing that the difference between a good and bad night\u0027s sleep could -- and should -- tip the scales when it comes to where a guest chooses to rest her head.CommentsSarah Degnan KambouPresident, International Center for Research on WomenThey are great in number, these girls; they belong to an exploding population of youth worldwide -- the largest in history. And these girls are bubbling with untapped potential that will continue to be squashed unless we put them at the center of global development efforts in the coming decade.CommentsBrian KrewsonR\u0026D engineer; bloggerImagine the company you work for held a poll and asked everyone if they thought it would be a good idea to put a soda machine in the break room. Some said no, but the majority said yes. So, a week later, there\u0027s a soda machine. Now imagine that Bill in accounting voted against the soda machine.Comments (17)David PaulPresident, Fiscal Strategies GroupThe arrogant claims to fiscal rectitude of the Tea Party belie the underlying realities. They are not the makers of their own imagination, but are rather in large numbers the takers that they have been so quick to disdain.CommentsTamara StarLife Coach, Speaker, WriterI\u0027m told happiness is a choice. Unfortunately we complicate our lives to the point of being unable to recognize happiness when it appears before our eyes.Comments (49)Victor StengerPhysicist, PhD, bestselling authorNo one can predict what practical applications can come out of the basic scientific research being done today, but history shows that without basic science we can expect little human progress.CommentsElaine WeissNational coordinator, Broader Bolder Approach to EducationThe biggest difference between education scholar Diane Ravitch\u0027s new book, Reign of Error, and former DC Schools Chancellor Michelle Rhee\u0027s book, Radical, is that the first is based on extensive facts, the second heavily on fiction.CommentsBarbra StreisandSinger; Actress; Director; Composer; ActivistAs we now enter the third week of the unnecessary government shutdown, Americans should remember the words of GOP Representative Martin Stutzman, \"We\u0027re not going to be disrespected. We have to get something out of this. And I don\u0027t know what that even is.\"Comments (688)Steven Schlozman, M.D.Assistant Professor of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical SchoolDo they WANT this? Do they WANT to have to carry around swords and worry that grandma isn\u0027t grandma but is instead a ravenous crocodilian humanoid (who nevertheless still wears her apron) and who will never, ever again bring you a holiday present?CommentsChristy Turlington BurnsFounder, Every Mother Counts, Director/Producer, NO WOMAN, NO CRY, global maternal health advocate, mom, modelIt\u0027s time to make a radical shift, to start seeing girls not as vulnerable or as a liability, but as potential leaders. It\u0027s time to see girls for who they are: the driving force of their generation, one poised to bring real social change.CommentsGreg SchwemCorporate comedian, Business emcee, Author, \u0027Text Me If You\u0027re Breathing\u0027Up until now I have always been prone to measuring success in minutes.

Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThe plates of the debate seem to be shifting in ways that could be positive, though virtually all the signals are mixed.Comments (19)Mike LuxCo-Founder, Democracy PartnersSold in the beginning as an environmental idea, it has become rife with problems of all kinds, including major environmental concerns, and is now just a fat corporate subsidy and a tool for Wall St speculators to make money off of.CommentsKristen Welchwearethatfamily.comI\u0027m that person that if you compliment my dress, I will tell you I got it on sale. If you like my hair, I will tell you it needs to be washed. If you tell me something good you see in me, I\u0027m the first to tell you something bad I see in me. It\u0027s not a good trait, the deflection of compliments.Comments (16)Brett GallaherFounder, WeOccupyJesus.orgI\u0027ve often wondered what would happen if average people actually knew about Church history and theology.

There\u0027s good reason to reject it. The Republican proposal isn\u0027t a concession. They\u0027re merely rescheduling their threat so that it can hang over the nation until Thanksgiving.Comments (71)Terry O\u0027NeillPresident, National Organization for WomenIf there was ever any doubt that the Tea Party is the most destructive force to dominate politics in generations, these past few weeks have underlined the message.Comments (64)Subhankar Banerjee, 2013.11.10Steve Mariotti, 2013.11.10William B.
