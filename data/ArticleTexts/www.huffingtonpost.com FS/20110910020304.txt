{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Practically every facet of our society was altered by 9/11 in some way, either by the attacks themselves, or, especially, by our response to the attacks -- a response that continues to evolve. Looking back ten years later we can finally begin to get a sense of just how the country was changed, and what elements of our society we\u0027d previously taken for granted. Starting today, with a special section titled \"9/11: A Decade After\", we will be examining those changes from all angles, collecting stories from across all of HuffPost, from the economy to national security, politics, education, parenting, pop culture, and the arts. The conversation starts here.Read Post | Comments (128)Dan Collins, 9/9/11New York Editor-At-Large of The Huffington PostTen years later, it\u0027s easier to acknowledge where we fell short. We\u0027re wiser -- in some ways But wen we retell the story of 9/11, we generally gloss over the fact that some of the first responders who died might have lived.Read Post | CommentsMichael Roth, 9/9/11President, Wesleyan UniversityOn this 10th anniversary of 9/11 let us simply acknowledge the claim that our painful memories still have on us. Let us recognize with piety that we still carry the traces of those traumatic events with us, and that we acknowledge their importance to us without trying to use them.Read Post | Comments (10)Amb. Marc Ginsberg, 9/9/11Former U.S. Ambassador to MoroccoIf 9/11 represented a \"clash of civilizations\" it also compelled a \"shotgun relationship\" between the U.S. and the Middle East.Read Post | CommentsBishop Gene Robinson, 9/9/11Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New Hampshire; Senior Fellow, Center for American ProgressWhile I believe ours to be the greatest country on earth, one that has done so much to improve the world, I also believe we have much for which we should repent.Read Post | Comments (30)Marlo Thomas, 9/9/11Award-winning actress, author and activistThis week, I had the privilege of sitting down with three remarkable young women who all had parents who died in the north tower of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.

Smith, 9/9/11President Obama put conservatives in a bind with his jobs speech. If they co-operate in helping their fellow citizens, they violate their code of personal responsibility without social responsibility. If they don\u0027t co-operate, they look callous and irresponsible.Read Post | Comments (204)Dan Rather, 9/9/11Host, \u0027Dan Rather Reports\u0027A decade after 9/11, we cannot rely on memorials and museums alone.

But today\u0027s Republicans are a nihilistic pack who would turn against everything their predecessors believed in, in the name of selfishness and greed.Read Post | Comments (64)Bishop T.D. Jakes, 9/9/11Senior Pastor, Potter\u0027s House, TexasIn spite of such pain we honor you as the God and guide who has enabled us to endure what we thought was impossible. Thank you for your sovereign grace that guides us beyond one moment of terror to a collective destiny beyond that moment.Read Post | CommentsDerek Henry Flood, 9/9/11Independent Editor, Writer and PhotojournalistA decade of talking about who has won and who has lost is both immaterial and intellectually childish. It was never about winning or losing. It is about carrying on with life. Getting on with the business of this awkwardly, unevenly integrating world.Read Post | CommentsAdam Winkler, 9/9/11Professor of Law, UCLAGun control advocates fear, and gun rights proponents sometimes hope, the Second Amendment will transform our cities into modern-day versions of Dodge. This is all based on a widely shared misunderstanding of the Wild West.Read Post | Comments (98)Danielle Crittenden, 9/9/11Managing Blog Editor, Huffington Post CanadaI remember that after the Sept. 11 attacks, a great pall fell over the otherwise gorgeous fall days.
