{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jason LinkinsEditor, Eat the PressAccording to a long string of ones and zeroes that were translated and illuminated inside this glowing box that I like to call \"the Internet,\" sometime former Alaska governor and vice presidential aspirant Sarah Palin is \"considering\" a run for the Senate. Specifically, Palin said, \"I’ve considered it because people have requested me considering it.\" Which makes sense. It\u0027s sort of like that thing where I tell you, \"Don\u0027t think of a sharknado,\" and then all you can do is think of a sharknado. But while lots of people, in that position, will go on to think of a sharknado, only a few will actually commit themselves to the effort of making a movie about a sharknado. The question is: Will Sarah Palin sharknado Alaska\u0027s Senate seat in 2014?Comments (24)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Suppose a small group of extremely wealthy people sought to systematically destroy the U.S. government.

Judging from Perry\u0027s most recent rants, 2016 will be 2012 redux, no matter what any autopsy of the 2012 election by the RNC or GOP strategists might reveal.Comments (213)Lauren LyonsRecent graduate, Harvard Kennedy School of Government; founder of BetaDater.comDespite NASA\u0027s award-winning social media and web outreach efforts, there are still massive gaps between the public\u0027s perception of the agency, and the reality.
