{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor of History and Latin American and Caribbean Studies at New York UniversityAs a historian of Cuba, as a Cuban-American, as an American citizen, I applaud President Obama\u0027s change of course on Cuba. Surprisingly, so do my 93 and 88-year old Republican parents in Miami. To say that they love neither Raúl Castro nor Barack Obama is an understatement. Yet, they were swayed by Obama\u0027s plain statement of fact: isolation has failed, and after more than 50 years we cannot reasonably expect it to produce a different result. They are weary, and yesterday they felt a stirring, a faint hope that finally something might move. What exactly will change of course remains to be seen. There is loud (and expected) opposition in some quarters, and questions are sure to arise about the relationship between the new policies and the requirements for diplomatic recognition spelled out in the Helms-Burton law of 1996. At the same time, however, there is bipartisan support for a new approach.It is easy to dismiss the whole matter with some lighthearted head-shaking. But we should take a moment to remember that the reality of life in North Korea is no laughing matter.Advocacy director, Human Rights WatchToday, as The Colbert Report airs its final episode, I\u0027m looking back with gratitude on nine years of great television. I loved being on the show several times, discussing everything from my Greek accent to self-sabotage to the obnoxious roommate living in my head. Here are some of my favorite moments on The Colbert Report over the years.By selling himself as someone who could get things done with Republicans, Obama gave them the power to make him a success or failure. Unsurprisingly, they chose the latter option. Is Hillary Clinton about to make the same mistake -- and will voters buy it if she does?Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourWhile technically we\u0027re still dealing with the hypothetical, the speculation-obsessed media doesn\u0027t seem all that bothered by the prospect either. That\u0027s what happens when we treat politicians like celebrities and exchange paychecks for access.Host/Producer, HuffPost LiveThe current Ebola outbreak underscores that pathogens remain clear and present dangers to humanity, economic development, and national security in an interconnected 21st century world, and we must remain vigilant against them.Public Health Editor, The Huffington Post; Former U.S. Assistant Surgeon GeneralIf human rights abuses really were the metric by which we decided on trade and travel, the U.S. should be banning Americans from visiting our staunchest allies and our most popular vacation spots (including much of the Caribbean, where homosexuality is illegal, though it\u0027s not illegal in Cuba). It would literally be much of the globe.Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesThe barbarous targeted attack on helpless children has done what a decade of terrorism couldn\u0027t -- Pakistan reacted venomously. The outpouring of grief for the victims and their families from across the country, the region and world has changed the very paradigm of how terrorism has been tackled by the government.Senior content developer, Geo News, PakistanFor The Interview, it appears for the moment, the show will not go on. It\u0027s hard to know exactly what motivated the theater chains that cancelled the show. The end result is that we have now allowed the government of North Korea to dictate content.President, People For the American WayNo one has all the answers, so whatever a woman who has the BRCA mutation chooses to do requires courage and an element of faith. And a lot of love and support.Medical editor, The Huffington Post; Founder and president, Preventive Medicine Research InstituteWhen there is conflict in unstable nations, the tide comes in with the strength of a tsunami to drown out the precious advances that women have made in those countries.Writer of English fiction and a journalistVishy Anand could be the Phoenix of Chess. Many times down, but never out. Again and again he rises up to snatch another tournament triumph, another world championship.International Chess GrandmasterReactions to Obama\u0027s announcement of normalization relations with Cuba were to be expected, but have already taken on a character that is largely divisive and unwarranted.School of International \u0026 Public Affairs, Columbia UniversityRape culture is living in a society in which your story is dissected rather than heard; it\u0027s being told your inherent, God-given value begins to disintegrate once your story gets uncomfortable and its trajectory skewed.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersChanges in technology are happening at a scale which was unimaginable before and will cause disruption in industry after industry. This has really begun to worry me, because we are not ready for this change and most of our leading companies won\u0027t exist 15-20 years from now.Academic, Researcher, Writer, EntrepreneurNot only have Netanyahu and his cohorts systematically been engaged in rancorous public narratives against the Palestinians, but they have taken action that could only attest to his unwavering commitment to expand the settlements and prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUThe environmental community has a communication problem. The problem lies neither with the validity of their facts and figures nor with the caliber of their experts. The problem is a failure to convey to the American people the relevance of the environment to their everyday lives.Former Coordinator, Value Chain Outreach and Responsible Care for the American Chemistry Council (ACC)Having a clean room can keep you healthier by ridding your space of dust, bacteria, and other stuff that can infiltrate your sleeping paradise. I\u0027ve gathered seven tips that you can easily implement into your routine to make sure your bedroom is in tip top shape.Entrepreneur, CEO at One Mall GroupThe campaign finance deregulation policy rider to the spending legislation signed by the president is a final recognition by politicians of both parties that nothing will be done to prevent or even slow down the seemingly unstoppable march toward even more money in American politics.Senior Fellow at the Bipartisan Policy CenterAs I prepare to retire from NRDC and hand the reins over to our incoming president Rhea Suh, I have been reflecting on how the climate movement can secure the solutions we need to protect future generations from harm. In my view, here are issues we need to keep in mind.President, NRDCIt might be life, or it might not be. But the good news is that we now have evidence of some sort of activity under the surface of Mars -- phenomena subject to solid, repeatable measurement.Senior Astronomer, SETI InstituteIn Apple Grove, West Virginia, there are some retirees from a chemical plant whose Christmas wishes probably include this: They want to keep the health insurance they were promised.President, Alliance for JusticeWith a thaw in U.S.-Cuban relations we might have an opportunity to come to terms with the long and sordid history of the United States\u0027 actions in the Caribbean divorced from the anti-communist hyperbole we still hear from some politicians and pundits.Professor, historian, authorWe all need a digital detox from time to time and my time is now. When I return to work and plug in again after the new year, I will be recharged and more productive; hopefully, I\u0027ll be full of great ideas. But right now, I\u0027m stepping back.CEO, The Creative Class Group \u0026 Author, UpgradeThe aging brain goes through predictable changes, and as a result, old age is usually accompanied by some cognitive decline, even dementia. Happily, some of the risk factors for mental aging are open to intervention.Author, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027The impact of Obama\u0027s decision is going to be felt far beyond Miami and Havana. America\u0027s standing in Latin America just received a zeppelin-sized dose of helium.Fmr. U.S. Ambassador to Morocco; White House Middle East AdviserAlthough eating gluten-free does not automatically result in improvements to your waistline, energy level, or skin, it can certainly be a springboard. And for celiacs, the benefits of a completely gluten-free lifestyle, inside and out, are undeniable.Gluten free lifestyle writer.
