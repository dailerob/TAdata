{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Act Two of the Nuttiest Show on Earth -- aka the race for the GOP nomination -- has just come to an end in New Hampshire. Though the country is sorely in need of solutions, and the public hungry for real debate, that\u0027s not what was served up in Iowa -- either by the candidates or the vast pack of media covering their every word. What we got instead was a deluge of attack ads, largely financed by the super PACs allowed by the Citizens United decision. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, 264 super PACs have been spawned for the 2012 race and they\u0027ve already spent almost half of the $32 million they\u0027ve raised. Perhaps this disconnect between what people are really concerned about and what the candidates are talking about is why only 17 percent of Americans are satisfied with the way things are going.Read Post | Comments (212)Robert Reich, 1/10/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Aftershock\u0027It\u0027s one thing to criticize Mitt Romney for being a businessman with the wrong values. It\u0027s quite another to accuse him and his former company, Bain Capital, of doing bad things.Read Post | Comments (198)Lincoln Mitchell, 1/10/12Harriman Institute, Columbia UniversityDespite efforts by candidates and the media to create a story that Mitt Romney has still not wrapped up the nomination, Romney has, in fact, all but clinched the Republican nomination for president.Read Post | CommentsPaul Rieckhoff, 1/10/12Founder of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of AmericaOur troops are many things to many people. Heroes, parents, diplomats, victims, villains, victors. But as the GOP primary heats up, there is one thing that everyone must understand they\u0027re not: political props. And that\u0027s not just my opinion, it\u0027s the law.Read Post | Comments (336)Mike Kaplan, 1/10/12Producer; Documentary director; Actor; Award-winning poster designerWith Stanley\u0027s rare combination of meticulousness and creativity, we achieved what we set out to accomplish -- but the most influential result of our collaboration was unexpected.Read Post | CommentsLisa Belkin, 1/10/12Senior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, Huffington PostThere is a certain look people get when you tell them you are going to your mother\u0027s wedding: a smile of surprise, mixed with an implied fist bump of \"you go girl\", mixed with just a touch of eyebrow raised confusion.

He\u0027s been gone a quarter of a century now, and his last movie was made forty-five years ago. Personally, I don\u0027t believe so.
