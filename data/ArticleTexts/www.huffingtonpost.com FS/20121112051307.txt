{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The good news is that the Democrats won the election and President Obama\u0027s spine has been stiffened on the subject of taxes. The bad news is that the skids are greased for a budget deal that cuts more than necessary, risks putting the economy back into recession, and blurs differences between the parties on critical issues like Social Security and Medicare. If Obama will just realize it, he holds most of the cards. He prevailed in the election. Most voters agree that the rich should pay higher taxes. Most don\u0027t want cuts in Medicare and Social Security. But by all appearances, the eager-beaver bipartisan Obama that we saw in early 2009 (until he got his clock cleaned) is back. Despite his recent victory, if he is too eager to make a deal, he -- and we -- will get rolled. Last time, Boehner\u0027s Republicans saved Obama from himself. This time, it will be up to his fellow Democrats.Read Post | CommentsOprah Winfrey, 11/11/12Chairman and CEO, Oprah Winfrey NetworkMy life is better when I get still regularly. Call it meditation or call it quiet time -- doesn\u0027t matter. The benefits are the same. If you stay with the practice, it\u0027s like developing spiritual muscle. I promise you will become less stressed, more focused.Read Post | Comments (41)William Astore, 11/11/12Writer, Professor, Retired Lt. Colonel, Air ForceTechnology is both overhyped and misunderstood in America, and that applies particularly to our enormous investment in military technology. This Veterans Day, we need to turn away from the false promise of robot weaponry.Read Post | CommentsDoug Bandow, 11/11/12Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteI\u0027m not thrilled with President Obama\u0027s victory. Still, I have to admit that Mitt Romney\u0027s loss left me with at least a half smile on my face. Mostly it\u0027s a result of schadenfreude, one of the baser human emotions, I admit. But I just can\u0027t help it.Read Post | Comments (167)Rita Cosby, 11/11/12TV Host, veteran correspondentAs the embassy dignitaries solemnly approached me to officially present my father\u0027s medal, my eyes immediately filled with tears. They caringly placed one of his country\u0027s highest honors into the palm of my shaking hand. It was a profound and overwhelming moment that was decades in the making.Read Post | CommentsJames Brobyn, 11/11/12Executive Director, the Travis Manion FoundationSome people don\u0027t ask me to explain why certain odors elicit such a visceral emotion. Perhaps they are unsure or even afraid of what I might say next. But for those who want to hear what I experienced in combat, I will always continue. It\u0027s a story I want to tell.Read Post | CommentsHuffPost Radio, 11/11/12In our \"after report,\" Reagan and Matalin discuss whether 2012 turned on Messina\u0027s GOTV or Obama\u0027s views on government and taxes.

Stone, 11/10/12Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoHow could the Republicans have won 55 percent of the House seats at the same time that Mitt Romney received only 48 percent of the popular vote? Did that many people split their vote? It turns out the answer is \"no.\"Read Post | Comments (341)James Wright, 11/11/12Author, \u0027Those Who Have Borne the Battle: A History of America’s Wars and Those Who Fought Them\u0027This Veterans Day is a good time to initiate a conversation about a memorial to the veterans who have fought our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, our longest wars. Forgetting wars is bad history. Forgetting sacrifice is irresponsible history.Read Post | CommentsLisa Belkin, 11/09/12Senior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, The Huffington PostPowerful men use sex in ways that powerful women don\u0027t. What is unclear is why. Is sex so fundamentally different for each gender that men see it as exerting their influence, while women somehow succumb to it?Read Post | Comments (957)Matthew Dowd, 11/11/12Political strategistAs we have become a more diverse and heterogeneous country (a good thing), many of the participants on the left and right have become less tolerant of each other (a not-so-good thing). The only way to govern this country is to bridge the divides that have become so apparent.Read Post | Comments (21)Susan Lisovicz, 11/11/12Reporter/Teacher/ConsultantMy uncle spoke with wonder of the massive aerial response at Normandy that saved him and his men. \"At times, there were so many planes in the sky you couldn\u0027t see the sky. You could see them forming from all directions into one pattern. And that\u0027s how we got off the beach, darlin.\"Read Post | CommentsRuth Bettelheim, Ph.D. and Geralynn S. Knorr, MS CCC, 11/10/12We know that traumatic brain injury increases rates of suicide and that it is the \"signature injury\" of the current wars. Yet it frequently goes undetected, or is misdiagnosed as PTSD or depression. Patients who are misdiagnosed, and therefore mistreated, are unlikely to recover. Instead, they are likely to despair.Read Post | Comments (66)Joshua Kors, 11/11/12Investigative Reporter, The NationForget wearing a flag pin. Or slapping a \"We Support the Troops\" bumper sticker on your Prius. This Veterans Day push yourself to do something that\u0027s actually meaningful. Here are six ways to honor our soldiers.Read Post | CommentsRabbi Shmuley Boteach, 11/11/12Rabbi and WriterAn American hero like David Petraeus who served his country with distinction and honor deserved better than to leave his post in humiliation and ignominy, even if his own immoral actions brought it upon himself.Read Post | Comments (37)John M.

But Skyfall is terrific, entertaining proof that Bond can age and thrive in the world of today.Read Post | CommentsMatt Stiner, 11/10/12Director of Justice for VetsOn this Veterans Day, as we honor the men and women who have sacrificed for our freedom, we must focus our attention on those veterans whose own freedom has been lost to incarceration due to substance abuse, mental illness, and trauma.Read Post | CommentsSierra Black, 11/10/12Writer, activist, motherWhile it\u0027s a stunning lapse in integrity for someone who was widely respected, it doesn\u0027t at first glance seem like the kind of lapse that has a lot to do with running the CIA. Does having an affair make him a less capable leader?Read Post | Comments (32)Jack Levison, 11/11/12Author, \u0027Fresh Air: The Holy Spirit for an Inspired Life\u0027Can we visualize with prophetic daring, like Isaiah rather than Joel, strategies to equip our soldiers to turn swords into plowshares? Can we imagine, this Veterans Day, effective ways to train them to make peace -- and be at peace themselves?Read Post | Comments (25)Howard J.
