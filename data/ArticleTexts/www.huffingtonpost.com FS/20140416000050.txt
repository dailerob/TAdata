{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Josh SilverDirector, Represent.UsToday is Tax Day. Most of us will dutifully pay our taxes to a government that no longer represents us. Policy decisions on nearly every issue, regardless of public opinion, are decided in favor of a select few who can afford to write massive checks, host campaign fundraisers, and hire armies of lawyers and lobbyists. That might read as an exaggeration to some, but it\u0027s a verifiable fact of the American political system. A new analysis of 1,779 recent policy outcomes by researchers at Princeton and Northwestern found that \"economic elites and organized groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on U.S. government policy,\" while average citizens -- the people in \"We, the People\" -- \"have little or no independent influence.\" Why? Because if you want representation in today\u0027s Washington, you must buy your way in.You might think the 1 percent pays a much higher tax rate than everyone else. But you\u0027d be wrong. Many millionaires pay a lower federal tax rate than many middle-class Americans.Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Any violence that is committed in the name of religion comes from extremists. These people masque their political or power agendas in false religious doctrine. We must make that distinction - between religion and extremists -- and combat the extremists.Imam Feisal Abdul RaufChairman, Cordoba InitiativeYou want to know how the working poor really live? My husband works an average of 50 hours per week just so we can barely make it paycheck to paycheck. We are the in-betweeners. Not making enough to live \"comfortably\" -- but not \"poor\" enough to get any assistance either.Ashley SchmidtbauerMother, wife, and bloggerSmarterTravelSmartertravel.comBrittney GrinerWNBA Player, Phoenix MercuryIngrid NewkirkPresident and co-founder, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA)The Climate Action Plan that President Obama announced last year is full of good ideas, and his administration has already done more to address carbon pollution than any other has. Unfortunately, a hard look at the numbers shows that all this progress could be undermined by one bad choice -- expanding fossil fuel production.Michael BruneExecutive Director, The Sierra ClubNot a single Republican voted in favor of the Paycheck Fairness Act, and many Americans no longer know what to think, either. The problem is that the message has been greatly muddled, twisted, and usurped, mostly for political gain.Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarAs women, we do a wonderful job blaming ourselves for the lack of romance in our marriage.Lindsey EllisonDivorce coach and founder of The Inspired DivorceLike the Yuppies of the 1980s, the Muppies of today are driven by ideals of success, status, power and the search to do and be what is \"important\" (read: \"cool\"). And were it not for the financial crisis, the Muppies might very well have followed their Yuppie predecessors to the suburbs.Michelle MillerAuthor, The Underwriting, an E-SeriesDrag is punk and should never be subjected to politically correct ideals. The moment it stops provoking is the moment it fails as an art form. Trans people are forever indebted to drag for the mainstream explosion of gender as we see it today.Our Lady JSinger/songwriter/pianistAlexa CorteseWriter, coffee-addict and lover of being outdoorsThere are now 10 times more people with serious mental illness in state prisons (207,000) and county jails (149,000) than there are in state mental hospitals (35,000). In 44 of the 50 states, the largest single \"mental institution\" is a prison or jail. How can this be possible?Thomas R. InselDirector, National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)But as the night runs as late as your twenties, the dishes are cleared, the coffee is drunk and you begin to part ways. As your friends meander out full of good food and new beginnings, you can feel doors closing all around you.Literally, DarlingOnline magazine for twenty-something womenI learned to have a thicker skin. I have learned how to tell the difference between innocent curiosity and a person who is intentionally being disrespectful. I have learned that every person and every day is beautifully different.Mathew MyersFounder of Little Motivator and New Hampshire nativeOn April 15, 2013, I woke up at 5:30 a.m. and walked to Mass General Hospital to begin my ER shift. It was the day of Boston marathon, and we were prepared for the usual influx of people with heatstroke and dehydration. Just before 3 p.m., we received the call that nobody could have predicted.Leana Wen, M.D.Emergency Physician and Director, Patient-Centered Care at George Washington University; Author, \u0027When Doctors Don\u0027t Listen: How to Avoid Misdiagnoses and Unnecessary Tests\u0027Since December 28, 2.3 million Americans have lost their unemployment insurance, with the expiration of the Emergency Unemployment Compensation program. Every week, on average, an additional 72,000 Americans are cut off -- the equivalent of one person every eight seconds.Rep. Matt CartwrightRep. Steven HorsfordWe assign a cultural significance to sex; it is for procreation and the preservation of the family unit. We are told it is to be cherished and not commodified, but meanwhile sex screams at us from every billboard and TV channel. It seems sex can be used to sell everything except for sex itself.Belle KnoxDuke porn star; sex-positive feminist; activist for sex-worker rightsThis fall, Democrats have the ability to motivate the voters to turnout at levels adequate to replicate the 2012 turnout mix -- just as they did in Virginia last year. But we need to focus 100 percent of our energy on motivation. That requires that we follow several important rules.Robert CreamerPolitical Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersI say nothing. I am in the passenger seat of the car of a rapist. I am wearing my seatbelt. I am firmly affixed to his car. I wonder if he moved 3,000 miles away from the divorce or his victim?Katie KoestnerDirector, Take Back The Night FoundationVincent DalyFounder, Publisher and Editor-in-Chief of CuteMonster.comThe single most important step the US government can take to reverse discouraging economic trends is to mount a concerted, large-scale program directed at renewing our national infrastructure.Lawrence H. SummersCharles W. Eliot University Professor and President Emeritus at Harvard UniversityThroughout all seasons of Breaking Bad, the science was strong; at times it seemed as if science was a separate character, such as the scene in which Walter and Jesse use thermite to break into the chemical storage building to obtain methylamine.Donna NelsonProfessor of Organic Chemistry at the University of OklahomaSteeped in history and politics, Real Madrid versus Barcelona is the world\u0027s greatest sporting rivalry. It may also be killing La Liga.Ryan MaddenSports writer, proponent of Intercollegiate AthleticsAs so much of the current gun debate is generated by fear -- fear of crime, fear of violence, fear of government -- physicians should bring their clinical experiences in managing fear to this debate and thus provide patients with sound and effective alternatives to picking up a gun.Mike WeisserMike the Gun GuyIn January 1941, FDR\u0027s State of the Union address made it clear that a fight was inevitable, a fight to preserve, protect and defend four essential freedoms: freedom from fear and want and freedom of speech and religion.Bill MoyersManaging Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyI feared sleep and its absence equally. Away from home, I suffered from terrible nightmares, dreams of a woman with long fingernails and a black, forked tongue sitting at the edge of my bed, of witches who emerged in the moonlight.BustleNews, entertainment, lifestyle siteThe hedge fund managers\u0027 tax break is different from other tax breaks in that it has no economic rationale. With most other tax breaks, there\u0027s at least an argument as to how it serves some socially useful purpose. This is simply a case where the rich don\u0027t feel like paying taxes and are saying to the rest of us, \"what are you going to do about it?\"Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Anatomy is for everyone. It is easy to relate to, because we all live in fleshy anatomical bodies that rouse our curiosity from an early age, and everywhere in nature there are surprising parallels with -- as well as bizarre differences from -- our anatomical body-plans.Dr. John R. HutchinsonProfessor of Evolutionary Biomechanics at the Royal Veterinary CollegeYour college choice isn\u0027t just about \"fit\" and \"comfort\"; it isn\u0027t just about the prestige of the school or the amenities it offers. Your college choice should reflect your aspirations, where you can imagine yourself discovering more about the world and your capacities to interact with it.Michael RothPresident, Wesleyan UniversityGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"SPIES DEMISE",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
