{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Doug KendallFounder and President, Constitutional Accountability CenterOur federal government was designed as a republic. Within this system, and over time, elections were to have consequences and enlightened public opinion was to govern. Extra-constitutional appendages like the filibuster, abused by minority parties, have moved us away from that vision. Instead, our government is in perpetual gridlock, and the American people have lost faith in their government to even function properly. Even after this rules change, one of our parties must still win the House, the Senate, and the presidency before radically changing our country. That\u0027s no small feat. It will often require victories over the course of several elections. That\u0027s probably as it should be. Change ought to be possible, but only when one of our parties really earns it. The filibuster gave a small minority in the Senate outsized power to stifle the will of the people.Comments (224)Jason LinkinsEditor, Eat the PressOver time, we have somehow allowed Black Friday to encroach upon Thanksgiving Day, and now, many major chains are opening their doors on what is traditionally America\u0027s happy family holiday, forcing their low-wage workers to leave their homes and loved ones to come into work.Comments (561)Jane SwiftCEO, Middlebury Interactive LanguagesWhat would you do if you could give your child something that is proven to boost her creativity, empathy and cognitive functions, while putting her on a path to increased academic and career success? You\u0027d jump all over it, right?Comments (4)Rob RhinehartCEO of SoylentI was pleased to learn that the latest popular dating app, Tinder, now has an Android client. Besides forcing me to reactivate my Facebook account, it seems simple enough. Unfortunately, I quickly realized that this was going to turn in to a massive time sink. Perhaps, I thought, I could optimize it?CommentsAshley HesseltineWriter, media personality, occasional standup comedian, and founder/editor of Witty + PrettyI imagine it\u0027s a pretty great feeling when someone you want to marry actually asks you to marry him. And I\u0027m truly happy for my friends who are entering into a lifetime of monogamy with the ones they love. But some of these statuses have to be addressed.Comments (606)Mike LoveLead singer, The Beach BoysAfter completing this song, it must have been 2 a.m. in the morning when we finally called it a night. We were awakened to the news that President Kennedy had been taken to Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas. For a bunch of carefree guys in our early twenties, our innocence was lost.Comments (18)Russell SimmonsFounder, GlobalGrind.comI thought I knew where most Democrats stood. I thought they stood on the side of the poor, the elderly, the disenfranchised, and all of those struggling to stay afloat during some very difficult economic times. But, then came a website.Comments (177)James Michael SamaWriter, actor, public speakerA man may be able to put across a great image, but it could simply be a cover for hidden shortcomings, or he could just be totally faking it to \u0027get the girl.\u0027 Here are some ways to know if you\u0027ve struck gold.Comments (130)Mickey GoodmanAuthor and JournalistWhen a college freshman received a C- on her first test, she literally had a meltdown in class. Sobbing, she texted her mother who called back, demanding to talk to the professor immediately (he, of course, declined).Comments (604)Kari Wagner-PeckFreelance WriterAt the risk of sounding trite, Mr. Klosterman is who we have been waiting for. People with intellectual disabilities and their families and friends and allies have been waiting for someone of his stature and character to come to the fore.CommentsJoanna ZelmanFront page editor, The Huffington PostI have shared beers in Uruguay with Brazilians as news broke our country allegedly had spied on their country. I have shared naan in India with an Afghani during the U.S. war in Afghanistan. It\u0027s hard to see a map\u0027s lines once you have shared a meal across borders.CommentsJeff DanzigerPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideCommentsAnn BrenoffSenior Writer, The Huffington PostI sleep like a baby, which is to say I sleep in short spurts throughout the night and wake up abruptly at inconvenient hours feeling kind of cranky. For years now, I have fallen asleep easily but rarely am able to stay asleep. I wake up at the slightest noise or light. I wake up when my husband moves the top sheet a millimeter.Comments (37)Kristy L. CampbellDirector of Marketing and Communications, MantaWhether your business is retail or service with the right tools, resources and a little pre-planning you can increase your sales and attract new customers during the holiday season.CommentsBelle Beth CooperContent crafter, BufferOne of the things that surprises me time and time again is how we think our brains work and how they actually work. For example, I always found it understandable that we can multitask, but according to the research, it\u0027s impossible for our brains to handle two tasks at the same time.Comments (26)Greg SavageLeader of the global recruitment industryA \"company\" is just a legal entity. A \"business\" is a collection of desks and computers. No one resigns because of that. It\u0027s the decisions, the motivation, the atmosphere, the ethos, the support, the training, the vision, and the direction set by the leadership that they will follow.Comments (20)Bernice A. KingChief Executive Officer, The King CenterWe mark the 50th anniversary of the assassination of JFK with sadness and wonder at what might have been if this extraordinarily charming and visionary president had lived to complete two terms. Yet we know that his luminous example of hope and courage continues to set the standard.Comments (31)Sierra McKenzieFreelance model and actress based in SeattleI remember hating my face and hating my skin and looking at all the girls around me in middle school and on TV and in ads and feeling like I was a monstrosity in comparison. I think makeup can be empowering, but acknowledging that it isn\u0027t natural is important.Comments (533)Susan BoyleI love the concept of \u0027Pay It Forward\u0027. The idea that you can pass on an opportunity and a good deed to someone deserving or help someone in life fulfil a dream is a wonderful concept, embraced not only in the USA but over 100 countries around the world and I strongly believe that we should make it more prevalent in the UK.CommentsMarlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistI\u0027ve always been a champion of kids pursuing their dreams. But sometimes in life, extraordinary circumstances may force us to temporarily put our dreams on hold. The most important thing is to never lose sight of that dream, no matter what punches life may throw in our way.CommentsScott BatemanWriter, animatorSome people have NO idea what Thanksgiving is, the poor dopes. Is it a type of freshwater fish? Is it a village in Lithuania?CommentsAmy PurdyParalympic SnowboarderI came home from work one day with what I thought was the flu and less than 24 hours later I was on life support and was given less than a two percent chance of living.CommentsBob CescaManaging Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowI\u0027m not talking about the myths and propaganda -- the \"death panel\" nonsense and the like. This is serious business: the well-financed, broadly implemented sabotage campaign designed to rig the law for failure, while also making it more difficult for Americans to receive insurance.Comments (982)Sen. Jay RockefellerU.S. Senator, West VirginiaThis month we celebrate Veterans Day and the remarkable men and women who protect our country. As we honor the service and the bravery they have shown in conflicts across the world, we should remember their challenges on the homefront as well.CommentsLester \u0026 CharliePolitical satiristsWow. We\u0027ve lived in this era of unchecked corporate greed for a while now. So it\u0027s rare that a company\u0027s actions take our breath away. But there you have it. The McDonald\u0027s hotline stopped just short of pointing out how much cheaper it is to kill yourself.CommentsEugenia ChandrisVice President, Chandris HotelsMacbeth murdered it with dire consequences; most people are deprived of it and while animals summon it with ease; it can be so evasive as to drive many to sickness and despair. Sleep has become more precious than any financial parameter, surpassing the intrinsic value of time itself... considered the ultimate equation with money.CommentsTodd GitlinProfessor of Journalism and Sociology, Columbia UniversityThe institutions of our ruling world have a powerful stake in the mad momentum of climate change -- the energy system that\u0027s producing it and the political stasis that sustains and guarantees it -- so powerful as to seem unbreakable. Don\u0027t count on them to avert the coming crisis.CommentsAnn VoskampNYTimes Bestselling Author, \u0027One Thousand Gifts: A Dare to Live Fully Right Where You Are\u0027Because get this, kids -- how a man proposes isn\u0027t what makes him romantic. It\u0027s how a man purposes to lay down his life that makes him romantic.Comments (178)Grant Freeland and Deborah LovichIt wasn\u0027t until Harvard Business School professor Leslie Perlow approached us with an interesting proposal eight years ago that we really grasped what was driving top talent away -- and began a radical experiment to improve our work-life balance.CommentsJennifer BreaDirector, \u0027Canary in a Coal Mine\u0027There is something elusive in the nature of the illness such that unless you live it, or live with and care for someone who does, it\u0027s almost impossible understand or describe. You might come close after decades of treating patients. At every turn, language fails.Comments (71)Adam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; co-founder of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911It is virtually impossible to see the devastation after Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines or last weekend\u0027s tornadoes in the Midwest and not feel a tug on your heartstrings. But charity scam artists use that near-universal empathy to steal from survivors of these terrible events the help that they need.CommentsCherie BlairFounder, Cherie Blair Foundation for WomenThe Middle East is a key region of interest because although increasing numbers of women are receiving a good standard of education, the region still lags behind on the core issue of economic equality.CommentsBen Harvey, 2013.21.11William Bradley, 2013.21.11Michael Rohrer, 2013.21.11Credit.com, 2013.21.11Cat del Valle Castellanos, 2013.21.11Margaret Paul, Ph.D., 2013.21.11Rob Rhinehart, 2013.21.11Tristan Higgins, 2013.21.11James Russell Lingerfelt, 2013.21.11Elliot S.
