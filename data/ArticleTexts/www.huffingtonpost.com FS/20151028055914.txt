That should make us feel good, since we would all like to think a person in this position understands the ins and outs of the federal budget. But instead of telling us about how much Ryan knows about the budget, how about telling us what Ryan actually says about the budget?Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027The United Nations Climate Change Conference of Parties (COP21) in Paris is only a few weeks away. This global conference is our last chance to tackle catastrophic climate change. If the negotiations fail, there is no plan B -- COP21 is effectively the end of the line.Founder and Chair, Bianca Jagger Human Rights FoundationLet\u0027s start this article with one fact: I do think venture capital has value. I think angel investor dollars have value and can do a lot. But as someone who has now looked at thousands, if not tens of thousands of deals in his career, it\u0027s very clear to me that it is becoming the default for young entrepreneurs.Wine and marketing expertI said as a parent and grandparent I was terrified, but let me tell you that as a pastor and seminary teacher I am outraged and I am determined to cast the light of the Christian Gospel on this behavior and call it to account.Professor of Theology, Chicago Theological SeminaryMy husband told me that he wouldn\u0027t want to be married to anyone who would place him above his children.

Whereas the billionaire property tycoon is peddling empty optimism, Carson\u0027s campaign has the hue of an Internet comment board.Night Editor, The Huffington Post UKIn a time when college enrollment is booming and college tuition is at an all-time high, the prospect of getting an upper-level degree and working at a college or university would seem like a sure bet for anyone. And yet, in 2015, a PhD does not guarantee a great living.Education Outreach Coordinator, Brave New FilmsProfessor, Author and Radio HostBecause I am not seen as a woman. Because they don\u0027t care about my pain. Because they don\u0027t believe in my pain. Because they forgive themselves without atoning. Because I\u0027m not free. Because I want more. Because I deserve better.Writer based in PhiladelphiaProviding basic city services is a responsibility of municipal governments that stands the test of time. But -- just because a service has been provided for a long time in one way, doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s the only way.Chief of Staff, City of BostonTo rely on the schools themselves to tackle the problem of assaults on campus is to accept the status quo since notable change will not occur at the initiative of university chiefs.

There\u0027s the rub.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghSince October is #FirePreventionMonth, I\u0027d like to ask you to take one small action to help prevent wildfires.

This exponential growth of speech is without precedent -- and it requires us to be clear on who the real speakers are.Senior Director of Strategy, Free PressToday, regardless of lessons learned over the years, it is important that every young person understand that Hillary Clinton is one of the most important global voices on LGBT human rights in our time.President, Elizabeth Birch Company/Global OutSo I wanted everyone to know that today when I was out shopping I paid the legally required sales tax on some gum I bought at the drug store. I am very proud of myself for doing so.Co-Founder, Democracy PartnersWhen you grow up gay in this part of America, where LGBT people are essentially invisible, just one hero can change your life.Writer, travel enthusiast, founder and president, Ski BumsThe United States is a peculiar sort of empire. Americans have been in what might be called imperial denial since the Spanish-American War of 1898. The U.S. not only denies its imperial ambitions, but shrouds them in a curiously American brand of Christianized liberation theology.Retired lieutenant colonel (USAF)If we support that penalty, we should do so with a clear understanding of what we\u0027re doing.

Over the last decade, these two groups have increasingly become the same people.Government affairs lobbyist, Public CitizenYou have to be special to want to inhabit a Glass House.
