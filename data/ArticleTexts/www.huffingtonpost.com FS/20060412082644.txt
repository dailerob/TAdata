{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AP/Pablo Martinez MonsivaisAP/Doug Mills\"How many people here have had a meaningful hallucinogenic experience?\" So asked one of the speakers at a fundraising dinner for the Drug Policy Alliance held last night in Los Angeles. When it was my turn to speak, I confessed that I have never had a meaningful hallucinogenic experience -- indeed that I have never even had a meaningless hallucinogenic experience. Other than the time I was seated next to Don Rumsfeld at a Washington dinner party. \"It was a long, hard slog,\" I told the crowd. \"But, as you know, you have to go to dinner with the dinner companion you have, not the dinner companion you want.\" The Rummy riff was more than a punchline -- it was a way of highlighting the many similarities between the debacle in Iraq and America\u0027s disastrous war on drugs.READ POST | comments (34)04.11.2006 James ZogbyThough the Administration remains in denial (fearful of parallels with Vietnam and rejecting warnings of imminent civil war), Iraq is spinning out of control.READ POST | comments (18)04.11.2006 David CornDid special counsel Patrick Fitzgerald come close to hitting the vice president of the United States with a conspiracy charge?
