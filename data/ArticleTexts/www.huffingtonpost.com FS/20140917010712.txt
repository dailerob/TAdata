If that\u0027s true, the following 10 images could provide the lyrics for a thousand blues songs. The graphs are taken from series of recent reports which, when considered together, create a paint-by-numbers picture of the lifelong losing game faced by working Americans. The chorus to our blues song goes like this: The middle class and working poor are increasingly trapped in a cycle of economic decline, a downward slope which stretches from their golden youth to their sunset years. And there\u0027s no way out, unless we find one for ourselves.Tens of millions of people had been living with the fear that if they lost their jobs, they would also lose their health insurance. This would be a big deal for most families but especially those in which one or more family members had a serious health condition. Insurers do not like to insure sick people. The ACA changed that.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Benghazi has been politicized in the most disturbing way possible, to the point where Fox News and conservatives have turned an American tragedy into something of a macabre Twitter punchline.Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaUnlike my client, perhaps you\u0027re aware coffee drinks can become sugar bombs, but even the most health-conscious among us struggle to know everywhere sugar hides and how to avoid those things.

Nothing highlights this absurdism like the current conflict with the Islamic State.Academy Award-winning director, screenwriter and producerThe only way to change professional football is at its foundation, transforming the culture in our schools and what defines masculinity -- and what defines being a girl or a woman or gay or transgender -- and, most importantly, that needs to happen within sports programs, not separate from them.Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesFor 25 years scientists have been explaining with careful precision the depth of our crisis. And for 25 years they\u0027ve been drowned out by the sound of money, a sound that has blocked the ears of our presidents and prime ministers and politburos. It\u0027s time for us to make our own clamor.Author of a dozen books, including \u0027The End of Nature\u0027 and \u0027Deep Economy\u0027Even if we ignore black women\u0027s grinding poverty, the sky-high rates of HIV infection, and the disproportionate incarceration, the fact is nearly half of all black women have been sexually coerced by the age of 18.Associate professor and associate chair of the African and African Diaspora Studies Department at The University of Texas at AustinAfter the Time of Potty, he washed his hands and his clothes and the floor and those around him. And then poopeth he did go. Not on the potty, but behind the potted plant. Because it was safe. And they sighed deeply and whispered the Prayer of the Pull-Up.San Francisco-based writer and humoristWe live in a contradictory world. Dispiriting events coincide with progress for human dignity. Bombs fall on children. The gay rights movement makes unimaginable gains. But when change occurs, it\u0027s because people find ways to act even in demoralizing times or when all the doors seem closed, and open up new possibilities by doing so.Author, \u0027Soul of a Citizen\u0027 and \u0027The Impossible Will Take a Little While\u0027Well, we can all relax now.

This relationship is a long-term partnership and should be viewed as such. You deserve to get the best possible care from your doctor(s).Cancerhawk.comThe U.S. now stood alone.

Or so it seemed.Editor, TomDispatch.comSuicide is never an easy thing to talk about, to prevent, or to understand. But recognizing the risk factors is an important step. During this year\u0027s observance of Suicide Prevention Month, we should work to draw more attention to the link between suicide and alcohol, in all its facets.Chief Medical Officer of Phoenix House and President of Physicians For Responsible Opioid PrescribingBecoming more self-aware in the process of aging is the hard earned prize of our adult lives.
