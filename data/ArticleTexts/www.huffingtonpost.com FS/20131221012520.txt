{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Michael KeeganPresident, People For the American WayYes, things are getting better. But that\u0027s not saying much. Republicans have lowered the standards of Congress so much that the completion of a basic task like passing a budget or confirming a non-controversial judge is now cause for celebration. Americans shouldn\u0027t accept the low standards of this new normal. It\u0027s like the relief of having a tooth pulled. The ache that\u0027s been with you for so long is gone, the sharp pain of having it pulled is over. But there\u0027s something missing. As we look forward to the year ahead, let\u0027s remember the tasks we left behind in the rancorous, bitter 2013. Barely functioning is not enough. We have a lot of work to do. Here\u0027s to higher standards in 2014!CommentsTEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"What can a pickpocket teach us about the art of getting people\u0027s attention? A lot - if you can keep up with him. Watch expert thief Apollo Robbins in action and see if you can figure out how he does it.Comments (14)Andrew PleplerGlobal Corporate Social Responsibility and Consumer Policy Executive, Bank of AmericaAs we near the height of the holiday spending season, I will risk being what my teenage son calls a \"buzzkill\" by asking: Do you have healthy money habits?CommentsDr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarCelebrity weight loss stories are called out as destructive and anti-feminist. And yet, there\u0027s something refreshing -- and, perhaps, even healthy -- about those celebrities who publicly discuss their ups and downs.CommentsNoah MichelsonEditor, HuffPost Gay VoicesWhile I love homophobes like Westboro Baptist Church for making my job easy, our real work is uncovering the wicked truth hiding beneath those who claim they love us while they bludgeon us with their Bibles.Comments (143)Ronni ThomasCreator and director, \u0027The Midnight Archive\u0027Why not take a few minutes between window shopping and sucking down Christmas cheer to celebrate the most fascinating, most allusive, most charming historical figure?CommentsStacie KrajchirAuthor, Founder The See and Sprout ProjectThe reality is, motherhood is, while blissful, downright scary and beyond overwhelming -- especially after 40.Comments (51)Jeremy Ben-AmiPresident and Founder, J StreetClearly, we must remain vigilant against the threat of anti-Semitism. But the constant use of the accusation against anyone that we feel is insufficiently pro-Israel (including members of our own community) or against anyone we disagree with is foolish and damaging.Comments (13)Elliott NeginDirector of News \u0026 Commentary, Union of Concerned ScientistsA new study documenting that just 90 companies are responsible for two-thirds of manmade carbon emissions since the Industrial Revolution triggered some pushback in the blogosphere. Blame the likes of BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and Shell for global warming? Not fair!Comments (26)Rev. Dr. Susan Brooks ThistlethwaiteProfessor of Theology, Chicago Theological SeminarySanta is kind of scary, especially when compared to Jesus. Santa is judgmental. Santa gives bribes for being good, and if you\u0027re not good, Santa doesn\u0027t forgive. He just puts coal in your stocking and moves on. Jesus will forgive you. That\u0027s the whole Gospel right there.CommentsAlan ElsnerAuthor, \u0027Gates of Injustice: The Crisis in America’s Prisons\u0027George Santayana famously said that those who cannot learn from history are condemned to repeat it. How true this is right now for the U.S., which after years of combat in Iraq and Afghanistan, now finds itself at a crossroads in its efforts to reach a peaceful, diplomatic solution to the crisis created by Iran\u0027s nuclear program.Comments (20)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027Praises of the pope are flowing around the world, commentary on the pontiff leads all the news shows, and even late night television comedians are paying humorous homage. But a few of the journalists covering the pope are getting it right: Francis is just doing his job. The pope is meant to be a follower of Christ.Comments (23)Russell SimmonsFounder, GlobalGrind.comHistory will judge this president not just for being the first black president, but for being the president that began our nation\u0027s course toward a more progressive union.Comments (15)Diedre A. WareWriter, Avid Reader, World Traveler, and Free SpiritThis man we idolized should have looked more like me. Or, rather, like my father. Because that\u0027s who he had been all along.CommentsBob BurnettBerkeley writer, retired Silicon Valley executiveIf approved by Congress, this pact between the U.S. and 11 or 12 of America\u0027s Pacific Rim trade-partners would govern 40 percent of U.S. imports and exports. So far, the negotiations are being conducted under tight security; for good reason, as there are big problems with TPP.Comments (15)Melissa Burkley, Ph.D.Associate professor of social psychology, Oklahoma State UniversityExternal forces whittle down our choices in unconscious ways; tricking us into thinking we have more free will than we really doCommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorIt\u0027s not over -- they still have to appropriate their new top-line spending numbers down to all the agencies -- but it looks like the budget deal that quite handily cleared both chambers will soon be enacted. But I\u0027ve got a few lingering thoughtsCommentsMarian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundAs millions of Christians around the world prepare to celebrate Christmas and their belief that God entered human history as a poor tiny baby, let us remember all the poor babies and children who struggle to live and realize their God given potential in our own rich land and all around the world today.CommentsTom EngelhardtEditor, TomDispatch.comYou have to imagine that line in giant letters with a monstrous exclamation point covering most of the bottom third of the front page of theNew York Post. The reference was to a caravan of vehicles on its way to or from a wedding in Yemen that was eviscerated, evidently by a U.S. drone via one of those \"surgical\" strikes of which Washington is so proud.CommentsBecky CavenderFreelance writer, artist, and single momI\u0027m not unaware that some men don\u0027t prefer us fat girls. They don\u0027t have to! It\u0027s not offensive that they don\u0027t. I\u0027m typically not attracted to slender, skinny guys. I doubt those men feel offended and left out.Comments (27)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, Beyond OutrageOur life chances are now determined to an unprecedented degree by the wealth of our parents. That\u0027s not always been the case. The faith that anyone could move from rags to riches -- with enough guts and gumption, hard work and nose to the grindstone -- was once at the core of the American Dream.Comments (427)Andrea MeyerWriterI do still wish, more than anything, that I had two children: Aidan and Nina. But now I know that longing for the daughter I lost does not mean I want a replacement.Comments (15)Winifred M. ReillyLicensed Marriage and Family Therapist and author of the relationship advice blog Speaking of MarriageThis week, we will celebrate our 35th wedding anniversary. Does that mean we discovered the \"secret\"? Hardly. Have we learned something? Definitely! And thank goodness for that.CommentsDan LyonsMarketing fellow at HubSpot and creator of \u0027The Secret Diary of Steve Jobs\u0027In public, Apple\u0027s rivals in the smartphone market have tried to downplay the technological advances Apple introduced in the iPhone 5s. But it turns out that one breakthrough -- Apple\u0027s speedy, 64-bit A7 microprocessor -- has set off a panic inside its competitors.Comments (306)Elena BrowerMama, Author of Art of Attention, Founder of VIRAYOGA NYC.And in our experience of a lazy brain, somehow it all seems as though it\u0027s \u0027happening\u0027 to us, rather than an inner state we\u0027ve (subconsciously) created. Time to train our brains, by educating the guards at the gates.CommentsMichelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesThe Bible\u0027s one verse on homosexuality is no excuse for horrendously defaming an entire group of people publicly and expecting your employer, with whom you\u0027ve signed a contract, to \"respect\" that as your religious belief.Comments (50)Jessica Ciencin HenriquezFreelance Writer and Author of the upcoming novel, Lies I\u0027ve Told My Therapist.I\u0027ve logged 24,600 miles in air travel this year alone, half of those with my infant son (who slept peacefully like the little cherub he is). I\u0027m here to set the record straight. It is too often the adults that act like babies.Comments (14)Nathaniel FrankAuthor, \u0027Unfriendly Fire: How the Gay Ban Undermines the Military and Weakens America\u0027The state -- at least the state of New Mexico -- does not privilege marriage as a way to make impulsive young men stick by their kids. It sanctions marriage to help strengthen the commitments of couples and families -- real families. And that includes gay ones.CommentsGrace BucheleBlogger, howibecametexan.comAs the \"white\" half of a Japanese-American couple, I noticed some of the same questions keep popping up again and again. After a quick chat with some other interracial couples, I realized my experiences were not unique.Comments (335)Lewis LaphamEditor of Lapham\u0027s QuarterlyAll humor is situational, but the forms of it that survive the traveling in time speak to the fundamental truth of the human predicament, which is that men die from time to time and worms do eat them. The jokes dependent upon a specific historical setting don\u0027t have much of a shelf life.CommentsMohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOInvestors have responded favorably to the outcome of today\u0027s highly-anticipated Federal Reserve policy meeting, and rightly so. Here are four key takeaways that speak to more than this afternoon\u0027s impressive market moves; they also shed light on what may be ahead.Comments (18)Timothy KarrCampaign Director, Free Press and SavetheInternet.comSo what gives? Why has one of the most revered news operations -- a program that has won more Emmy Awards than any other TV news organization -- turned its back on the kind of shoe-leather investigative reporting that has earned it a record-setting audience?Comments (16)Louis Virtel, 2013.20.12Alejandro Rojas, 2013.20.12A.
