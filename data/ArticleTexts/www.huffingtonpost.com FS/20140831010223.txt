{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe disparate treatment of Black children in the classroom from the earliest years, especially Black boys, often discourages and knocks many off the path to high school graduation and college. The cumulative and convergent toll of subtle, but discouraging, adult actions in schools and other child-serving systems they come into contact with too often impedes the success of children of color, especially those who are poor, and burdens them with an emotional toll they don’t deserve. As the new school year begins it\u0027s crucial to hold up examples of success and inclusive education -- and focus on steps that work to make that success possible for all children. And it is important to hold up examples where all children are excited about learning and feel empowered and encouraged to ask as many questions as they can.Congratulations, America. This is why we can\u0027t have nice things. And when historians of the future look for someone to blame, I hope they include a brief mention of the outrage over Obama\u0027s ordinary suit.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027How do you explain suicidal crickets and zombie caterpillars? One word: parasites. Science writer Ed Yong shows us how these tiny creatures force insects and animals to do their bidding, and asks: Are parasites manipulating humans, too?\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"The long-term solution everyone\u0027s been talking about -- including Merkel and her Foreign Minister, Walter Steinmeier --is \"federalization.\" For Russia, long a champion of federalization in the Donbas (and long a foe of federalization at home), federalization means near-independence.Ukrainian-American Political Scientist, Rutgers UniversityThe truth is, as long as nuclear weapons exist, we are not safe. The human and environmental devastation caused by nuclear weapons -- whether by testing, mistake or malice -- is the very reason we need to eliminate them altogether.Fmr. CIA covert operations officerThe raging debate on inequality and its remedies often omits discussion of unions and workers\u0027 power. Our extreme inequality is attributed largely to globalization and technology, which have transformed our economy. But this leaves power and politics out of the equation.President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureThe spectacle of Mitch McConnell kowtowing to Charles and David Koch and other billionaires gathered recently at a luxury resort. This is going to help define the national narrative for the 2014 campaign -- these tapes make 100 percent clear that the modern Republican party is controlled by the Kochs and their billionaire friends.Co-Founder, Democracy PartnersAlmost daily, we are faced by difficult choices we are challenged to confront over a range of foreign and domestic policy concerns. As these choices play out, I am often guided by an important lesson I learned more than four decades ago from one of my heroes in the U.S. civil rights movement, Julian Bond.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Imagine schools where children were tested every three or four years, at transition points, as in the world\u0027s top-performing nations. Imagine schools where teachers wrote their own tests and used their professional judgment.Research Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027What we know today as \"email\" is a really a system -- a system of interlocking parts, each of which is essential for ordinary people to communicate effectively with one or many others. As a part of the Huffington Post\u0027s History of Email Series, this post provides details on the first email system created at UMDNJ in 1978.Senior IST Technologist at Rutgers Medical School (RMS) in the school of Biomedical SciencesShould we know whether or not our kids, or ourselves, are overweight? Of course, just as we should know -- before a mechanical calamity -- that the oil in our car needs changing, or our tire pressure is low.Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterThis Labor Day, let\u0027s remember that hardworking men and women are the backbone of our country, and let\u0027s redouble our efforts to uphold our nation\u0027s great promise to them: that if you work hard and play by the rules, you can make it in America.U.S. Secretary of LaborIt is no surprise that Islamic State has adopted some of the CIA torture methods such as waterboarding. This is the very definition of the spiral of violence, where violence used as revenge begets more and greater violence.Professor of Theology, Chicago Theological SeminaryIn these incredibly challenging times in the Middle East, parts of Africa and Asia, the world needs small countries with New Zealand\u0027s record to be sitting in the UN Security Council. And it is important for other small UN member states to see New Zealand win and know that the UN Security Council is accessible for them too.Former President, East Timor, 1996 Nobel Peace Prize laureateHonestly, it seems like there is maybe one week of summer we can actually enjoy. I don\u0027t care if there is pumpkin spice lattes to be had and school supplies to be bought. Summer doesn\u0027t end for weeks. Let\u0027s stop rushing through the season.Executive Editor, HuffPost HomeIt\u0027s impossible to delineate every way race affects us every day, but a cursory examination of major structural racial problems can give us a feeling for how far we still have to go.WriterYou probably disagree with me, and that\u0027s cool; enjoy your sport and find happiness in it. I didn\u0027t. So I\u0027m not going to purposely watch any NFL games anymore.Local Internet userWhen women lose races, it\u0027s seen as a personal failing. When high-profile men lose, seemingly omnipotent outside forces are to blame. A sampling of press coverage of losses from Tom Daschle to Scott Brown to Mitt Romney to Eric Cantor helps paint the picture.President, Barbara Lee Political Office and Barbara Lee Family FoundationWith more than 1,000 U.S. troops on the ground in Iraq, surveillance flights over Syria, and over 100 airstrikes launched in Iraq, it is time to start asking the hard questions about the latest U.S. military intervention in the Middle East.Advocacy Director, Win Without WarRemember that the brain, like the body, needs rest. Allow employees to take advantage of brief downtime several times a day so they return to their desks mentally refreshed. Respect their vacation time with their family and friends.Cognitive neuroscientist; Founder and Chief Director, Center for BrainHealth, University of Texas at DallasTolstoy wrote in War and Peace that \"kings are the slaves of history.\" And when the \"king\" in question depends on the patronage of happy customers for his well-being, his monarchy is also a slave to public opinion. Unfortunately for Burger King, which intends to renounce its American status for tax purposes, neither history nor public opinion is on its side.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourVladimir Putin appears steadfast in his determination to reclaim large sections of Ukraine -- in particular its industrial heartland -- through intimidation and violence, while denying any but humanitarian involvement there. This raises the question: Is Putin psychotic?Professor of Psychology and Education, Columbia UniversityThe new ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has immediately raised the same old question: Will it last, or is it merely just another pause, providing the prelude for the next round of fighting à la previous ceasefires? I believe the current ceasefire is different as it was achieved under completely different circumstances and may well last.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUIf you\u0027re young, black and female, your identity might be a liability. Recent studies have proven that online dating can be tainted by racism.Online magazine for twenty-something womenClearly, there are a lot of people who feel that the economic recovery-over five years old by now, at least by the official count-isn\u0027t reaching them.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorChange is needed on campus, but it does not need to come from the victim.Middle East correspondent, The WorldPostThis misclassification game is just one way that big companies have been rigging the rules to give themselves an edge, getting around what We the People set down for our democracy. The result, of course, is even more people paid even less with even worse working conditions.Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureThe crime of killing someone is now turned into a battle of narratives where the only other person who could challenge the narrative is dead, and millions of people simply believe that the unarmed black man deserved his fate.Author and Journalist published in Salon.com, the Jerusalem Post, Chicago Tribune, The Hill\u0027s Congress Blog, and other publications. www.hagoodman.comThe conventional wisdom is that \"kickers don\u0027t really matter\"...\"they are too unpredictable\"...and \"just get anyone from a pretty good offense, especially if they play in a dome or a warm weather city.\" I couldn\u0027t disagree more.6-time Tout Wars,1-time LABR + 2-time CDM national fantasy baseball champion.
