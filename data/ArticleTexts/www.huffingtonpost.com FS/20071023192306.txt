We now have a mainstream on the right that supports torture, that is backing an Attorney General nominee who is agnostic on torture, and that rallies behind a president who refuses to define what the word \"torture\" means.

A mainstream that continues to back the White Houses delusions about Iraq at the expense of our military, our treasure, our safety, and our standing in the world. A mainstream that supports the gutting of our civil liberties. So, it can no longer be denied: the right wing lunatics are running the Republican asylum.Read Post | Comments (515)BIOValerie Plame Wilson, 10.22.2007What hasn\u0027t been discussed in any depth yet is how the CIA fought to censor large portions of my book -- an attempt to demean and diminish me and my responsibilities at the Agency.Read Post | Comments (115)BIOQueen Rania of Jordan, 10.22.2007To hear some in the West, all Arab women are backward and oppressed... while some Arabs assume all American women are desperate housewives seeking sex in the city.Read Post | Comments (72)BIOMichael Seitzman, 10.23.2007Excuse me, but my tribe has been run down by every small-d*ck thug since cro-magnon had his first bar mitvah.
