{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Author, research psychologist and gender scholarA new study released last week by the Virginia-based nonprofit Treatment Advocacy Center reported that people with untreated mental illness are 16 times more likely to be killed by police than people without. In fact, people with severe mental illness account for one in four of all fatal police encounters. One reason for this is that those suffering from mental disorders are more likely to come in contact with authority figures: Although less than four percent of the general population suffers from severe mental illness, they generate 10 percent of all calls for police services and they take up at least 20 percent of spots in American prisons -- where, it should be noted, they are often unable to get the care they need.Three years after the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Newtown, Connecticut where a lone 20-year-old gunman wielding an assault weapon snuffed out 26 child and teacher lives, our nation has done shamefully little to protect children instead of guns.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundAs we do every year, we are pre-empting our regular \"Friday Talking Points\" column, in order to bring you our \"best and worst of 2015\" list.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comIn the wake of the Paris terror attacks of November, 13 that left 130 dead and the San Bernardino, Calif. terror attack of December 2 that killed 14 and left another 22 wounded, anti-Muslim hate crime attacks appear to have risen sharply across the United States to a level nearly three times the monthly average of the last five years.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityIt\u0027s increasingly clear that Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, Chair of the Democratic National Committee, isn\u0027t acting as a neutral party Chair, trying to insure a fair and democratic primary and building the Democratic Party in the states. Rather, she\u0027s acting as a shill for Hillary Clinton, doing everything in her power to ensure that no one will effectively challenge Hillary\u0027s coronation as the nominee.Entertainment attorney, writer and political activistThe networks have grasped Donald Trump to their collective bosom like the winner of one of those misogynistic, televised beauty pageants he owns. Each pronouncement from the Sultan of Slur is treated as epic, no matter how deeply insulting, bigoted or just plain ridiculous.Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanySenior writer, BillMoyers.com. Former senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.Sleep has been a part of HuffPost -- an obsession, really -- since we launched our dedicated sleep section in 2007, prompted by my own collapse from exhaustion and sleep deprivation. And now I\u0027m delighted that we\u0027re taking this commitment to the next level with Sleep Wellness, a new platform, sponsored by Sleep Number and dedicated to furthering the conversation on sleep as a public health issue and on all the ways sleep can enhance our lives.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027If we expect education to be the great equalizer, then it\u0027s not good enough to start at the college level, or the elementary and secondary levels, or even at the kindergarten level. We need to start in children\u0027s earliest years.U.S. Senator from New HampshireIt may not happen for another four years, but one of these lunatics could eventually win the presidency. If that happens, you can expect a massive paradigm shift in the American political culture, driving an already right-wing country further to the right, even into outright fascism.Writer and historianThere is an old saying for people who are stuck in an unhealthy situation: If you want to get out of a hole, stop digging. There is a corollary for a world addicted to fossil fuels: If you want to cure the addiction, stop subsidizing the drug.Executive Director, Presidential Climate Action ProjectWhen I say I\u0027m an educated, independent and ambitious Muslim-American woman, I mean it. As a child of war, I learned at a very young age what it means to be a female in this world. After 9/11, I also learned what it means to be a Muslim-American in this world.Financial Decision Support Analyst, Muslim AmericanWhen the movies by and about women do come out, in equal numbers and with equal budgets, hopefully the men who review them will have evolved enough to see a woman-child doing crass, gross-out comedy with her female co-star and find it funny.Author, \u0027Happiness as a Second Language\u0027Like a lot of progressive-minded folks, I\u0027d grown more aware in recent years of Sen. Bernie Sanders, and his cast-out-the-money-changers rants against income inequality, corporate greed, and billionaire influence in American politics.Author, \u0027The Bern Identity\u0027Sinatra: The Chairman is coming out in the 100th anniversary year of Sinatra\u0027s birth, and it does as good a job as any book has of showing why Sinatra is truly an artist and a man for the ages.Journal of Books and IdeasOne of the more attractive features of the new philanthropy is also one of its potential pitfalls: Many tech billionaires may not fully appreciate the fact that rapid cycles of testing, failing, and fine-tuning may work better in software development than in social welfare programs on which lives depend.Project leader at The Boston Consulting GroupPartner at The Boston Consulting GroupThe world chess champion Magnus Carlsen won the Chess Grand Tour, a three tournaments bonanza played in Norway, the USA and England, and involving the world\u0027s best players.International Chess GrandmasterAs I survey the post-2016 alternatives, I’m increasingly concerned that, for the immediate future at least, what we got over the last two terms is as good as it gets.Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogPresident Obama signed today represents months of negotiations by the House and Senate. And while some of the loudest and largest passengers on that omnibus include defense spending, tax reform, and homeland security, a number of critical animal causes fortunately found seats as well.ASPCA President and CEOEvery Student Succeeds Act represents a substantive shift: It returns a fair amount of control over education policy to the states. This has led to celebration in some quarters and worry in others. I believe both reactions are misconceived -- or at least overstated.Education expertWe pilgrimaged to a lonely spot on the outskirts of the city and another site in the town of Wetumpka. We dug dirt from the holy ground and placed it in those jars. We remembered and prayed for those lynching victims by name. It was a powerful and moving experience for all.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersI first started working at the strip club as a waitress. My \"interview\" was me walking into a cluttered manager\u0027s office, on the top floor of a downtown club. The manager took one look at me and then called a different manager of another club to tell him \"I have a beautiful girl for you that will be dancing in no time.\"Writer. Sports lover. Whiskey drinker. Mom.Let\u0027s downgrade them from \"joined at the hip\" to \"pretty good friends.\" This will enable us to pursue a more aggressive policy against ISIS, because the main constraint against doing so in the past has been our closeness to Saudi Arabia and Turkey, which have opposed an aggressive policy against ISIS.Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicyLee\u0027s new film, Chi-Raq, might not be \"likable\" but it definitely follows his previous films as it prompts viewers to think critically about unresolved tensions and problems in the film and the broader social world.Professor, Writer, Teacher, Freestyle artistIn September, the IRS proposed giving nonprofits the option of providing more information about people who contribute $250 or more. What kind of information you ask?Author of Swiped. Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and IDT911Progressives need to build the infrastructure and the foundation at the state level to lay the groundwork for policy wins -- now is the time to dig deeper into the states. We must make progress now and over the long-term to help families make ends meet.Former Secretary of Health and Human ServicesMy concern is not whether Trump really is a Christian, though I admit I have serious doubts. Rather, my concern is whether his stated views and beliefs line up with Christian thought. And it is clear that many of them do not.Philosophy Professor, Author, SpeakerThe reality is that polls today contradict the belief that Clinton will run away with the nomination. Democrats won\u0027t vote for a candidate they don\u0027t trust, no matter how many poll say Sanders is behind Clinton. Ultimately, Bernie Sanders will win the Democratic nomination because he\u0027s more trustworthy than Clinton, and few people can dispute this fact.Columnist published in The Cleveland Plain Dealer, The Baltimore Sun, The Hill, Salon, The Jerusalem Post www.hagoodman.comThe justification for Turkey\u0027s membership in NATO and America\u0027s defense guarantee for Ankara long ago passed.
