{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Founder, People for the American WayPeople For the American Way has never argued that people should not bring their religious and moral perspectives into public life. In fact, I have frequently and publicly chastised political liberals for ceding the language of faith and spirit to those on the far right. What troubled me about the political televangelists of the day was not that they were encouraging fellow conservative Christians to get involved in politics, but that they disparaged the faith and patriotism of people who didn\u0027t share their religious beliefs and right-wing political views. And that is exactly what Ben Carson did when he said that he would \"absolutely not\" support a Muslim becoming president of the United States.Our democracy\u0027s decisions should reflect voter views.

They will arrive destitute and alone, fragile from living through years of atrocities and equipped only with their fading dreams.Persian Gulf-based reporterCritics of Putin are snickering at poll results claiming he has an approval rating of 90 percent. In a slew of sarcastic posts and memes, they\u0027re slamming the findings as skewed and joking that support for the president will soar into the triple digits by the end of the year.Vocativ - news sourced from the deep web.To the average viewer who only watches the debates and listens to the current soundbites, O\u0027Malley sounds like a good candidate for Clinton\u0027s cabinet (or whatever he\u0027s aiming for at this point). But in Maryland we all know the truth about O\u0027Malley.Activist and writer, MandaWritesThings.comIt\u0027s a strategy that is not only unsuccessful with this extreme GOP, but it\u0027s an insult to those of us who have been viciously targeted by the GOP, whether we be women, LGBT, people of color or working people trying to make a decent wage.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostMigrants are innovative and entrepreneurial. In the 19th century a third of the population of Sweden, Ireland and Italy emigrated to America and other countries. The U.S. is the very best example of how dynamic a country of immigrants can be.Activist, Pussy Riot band memberOver the past year, there have been significant advances in wages for working-class Americans. Many cities and states have increased their minimum wages providing millions of Americans with a long overdue raise. In Congress, however, progress is nonexistent.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorMy oldest son is 16 and his life does not need to be threatened when he takes his date out for dinner.

Not necessarily in that order.The Benghazi investigation was never about getting to the bottom of what actually happened. It was always a dirt-digging operation, a wild search for some hint of scandal that could stop Barack Obama from being re-elected, and, when that failed, stop Hillary Clinton from succeeding him.Founder of Correct The Record and Media Matters for AmericaMany people who experience this strange haunting of suicidal thoughts are not depressed or mentally ill. We need to begin to ask the deeper, more probing questions behind their desperate, extreme acts.Jazz singer/songwriter; granddaughter of Norman RockwellJeb Bush, battling slumping poll numbers, will travel to Regent University this Friday for an interview with the school\u0027s founder, televangelist Pat Robertson. While Robertson\u0027s influence has diminished over the years, he has had a lasting (and damaging) impact on American culture and politics.Senior Fellow, People for the American WayThe problem is that, to a large degree, it seems that American intellectuals -- particularly those in academia -- have fallen out of love with freedom of speech.President, Foundation for Individual Rights in EducationI don\u0027t want to be the father that was buying his kid\u0027s love with gifts. I want to be the father that spent quality time with his kid and created memories that last for a lifetime.International PR Expert on Emerging Markets, Bestselling Business Author and CEO at P WorldRegardless of whether a domestic abuser is a boyfriend, spouse, ex-spouse, or father of his victim\u0027s child, that person should obviously lose the privilege of gun ownership. We must address the very real dangers of guns in dating violence and domestic abuse by closing the \"boyfriend loophole.\"Host of \"Dr. America\" on We Act Radio, pediatrician in Washington DC, member of the National Physicians AllianceBeing busy has somehow become a badge of honor. The prevailing notion is that if you aren\u0027t super busy, you aren\u0027t important or hard working. The truth is, busyness makes you less productive.Author of #1 bestselling book, Emotional Intelligence 2.0, and president of TalentSmart, world\u0027s leading provider of emotional intelligence.While it may be tempting to dismiss me as a single-issue voter with a narrow view of the world, consider whether there is one other issue whose poisonous vines stretch so broadly across every inch of our national landscape: public health, the economy, national security, civil rights, crime, family life, and education.Director of the Legal Professionals Program, Hazelden Betty Ford FoundationBoth papers have substantially underrepresented the number of civilians killed in drone strikes in Pakistan and Yemen, failed to correct the public record when evidence emerged that their reporting was wrong and ignored the importance of international law.Independent source of news and analysis, from the academic and research community.That Asian Americans voted in higher numbers for the Democratic Party in 2012 than any other point in history should have sounded a major alarm to Republican candidates.Attorney, New York City; Former Leadership Institute Fellow at Center for American ProgressThe Benghazi investigation has gone on longer than the investigation into Watergate. The is a hugely divisive political issue, and while it happened three years ago, it\u0027s coming up a lot now. Just in time for 2016.theSkimm makes it easier to be smarter. We read. You Skimm.

That\u0027s because he\u0027s been waiting since November 2014, when President Barack Obama appointed him to serve on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, to be confirmed as an appeals court judge.National President for the Hispanic National Bar Association and partner at Cooper \u0026 Dunham LLP, New York CityThere\u0027s a new big dipper in the nighttime sky.
