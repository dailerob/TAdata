{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Military Correspondent, The Huffington PostFifty-one thousand American troops have come home from Iraq or Afghanistan diagnosed with brain injury. What\u0027s become of them? Many have worked with military or VA specialists to learn to overcome or compensate for deficits in memory, speech, organizational skills, reading, finger dexterity -- everyday skills we take for granted. Tens of thousands of other Iraq and Afghanistan combat veterans were never diagnosed with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and may be struggling without knowing why. The VA\u0027s shortage of therapists and difficulty reaching rural veterans means even those diagnosed may not get all the help they need. But even those who were diagnosed and treated find that at some point, therapy has done all it can do. More sessions won\u0027t necessarily help. From that point on, veterans say, their lives become a matter of coping.On the whole, is American exceptionalism a force for good? The question shouldn\u0027t be hard to answer.

We must remain strong and free.Executive Program Director, Debate Mate USAWhen I have an opportunity to mentor someone, I find the most important thing is to listen to them when they tell you about themselves. That will always give you an idea of what type of support they need.Seven-time NBA All StarWe live in a world where as many as 440,000 Americans die each year because of preventable medical mistakes.

But Canada is a key ally in the war against terrorism in general, and ISIS in particular. And today\u0027s attack is a harbinger of things to come in America.Political science professor, LaGrange College in GeorgiaThe average Joe doesn\u0027t have much of a voice these days in what lawmakers are deciding. We can\u0027t afford lobbyists to speak on our behalf. HBO, CBS, Showtime, Netflix, Amazon and the rest have more than enough money to lobby for Net Neutrality -- it ultimately affects their bottom line. As strange as this may seem, this could end up being a rare case of what passes for Capitalism in this country actually working for average people.Richard Zombeck is a freelance writer for hire living in the Boston area and hangs out at www.zombeckink.comThe Internet and social media now puts all of us, the intrepid and the faint-hearted, at the same table together and aggregates our fears.

He offers genuine change and progress for this very special place we live in, a county with a larger population than forty-two states.Warschaw Professor of the Practice of Politics at the University of Southern CaliforniaThese simple recommendations to eat a plant-based diet, be physically active each day, and avoid alcohol can help our girls avoid breast cancer in later life.Board-certified radiologist; Board member, Lesscancer; Author, \u0027A World Without Cancer\u0027With 83 million records sold worldwide and four Grammys, an Academy Award and a Golden Globe to her credit, Annie Lennox \"re-interprets\" jazz and blues standards from the Great American Songbook on her new CD, Nostalgia.PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorMy faith rests in my spiritual connection to my children.

He has been in the NBA over half of his life, which is almost inconceivable in itself, and he\u0027s returning from a devastating knee injury that cost him pretty much an entire season. ESPN.com ranked him the 40th best player in the league -- and that\u0027s preposterous.The Huffington Post\u0027s sports columnist, The Schultz ReportEvery taxpayer, business, and government agency in America is supposed to be able to pass a financial audit by the feds, every year. It\u0027s the law, so we do our duty. There\u0027s one exception: the Pentagon.Co-founder, CODEPINK: Women for Peacef the United States and its allies cannot find a way to counter violent religious extremism while promoting and protecting human rights then everyone will lose.International Policy Adviser for Human Rights FirstIf white Mississippians can identify with, embrace and cheer deliriously for teams that are 82 percent (Mississippi State) and 75 percent (Ole Miss) black, is it too much to hope that they might bring themselves to at least stop hating and show a modicum of respect to a president who is 50 percent black?HistorianSo why do we keep using that word even though it feels kind of icky? And why are my fellow gay brothers so into it?Writer, Comedian, ManIt seems the world has begun to realize that a large piece of the millennial generation has suffered the consequences of an increasingly unequal global economy that has fostered despair and in many places, violent expressions of dissatisfaction.Founder and Executive Director of The GroundTruth Project, Co-founder of GlobalPostIn that Christmas season trip to Berlin, Bernstein would famously conduct two performances of Beethoven\u0027s Ninth Symphony with an international orchestra and chorus assembled from the four countries that once shared the city -- the U.S., Russia, England and France.

But he might have trouble convincing the justices to join his game.Chief Counsel, Constitutional Accountability CenterI thought it was all about big boys, who should have known better, shaking me down for candy. Then again, some things don\u0027t make sense until you\u0027ve lived them with your own child -- and not a moment sooner.Writer, hospice volunteer and whitewater kayakerFeminism cuts both ways, and too often, men are not protected against cruelty -- especially in regards to their bodies -- in the same way women are, based on the presumption that they\u0027re men and can deal with it.
