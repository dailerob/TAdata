{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonHello from Dharamsala, India, where I\u0027m attending a gathering of The Mind and Life Institute with the Dalai Lama, and where Prime Minister Manmohan Singh wasn\u0027t bothered by this week\u0027s news that the NSA had accessed 70.3 million calls in France and tapped German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u0027s cell phone -- because he doesn\u0027t own a cell phone or use email. EU leaders are less sanguine and are sending a delegation to Washington for talks to set new guidelines, like Merkel\u0027s demand for a \"no-spying\" pact similar to one America has with the UK. As Obama said in Berlin in 2008, true partnership and progress \"require allies who will listen to each other, learn from each other and, most of all, trust each other.\" We\u0027ve got the listening part down; trust -- not so much. If only the NSA had spied on the Department of HHS and reported back to the White House about the state of the Obamacare rollout instead.Comments (44)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundOur nation\u0027s gun violence epidemic is not inevitable. Scholars must be allowed to do the desperately needed scientific research that will help parents, policymakers and the public determine how we can all work together to stop it.Comments (294)Dylan RatiganNew York Times Best-Selling author, entrepreneur and formerly the host of MSNBC\u0027s The Dylan Ratigan ShowOur health care system is shaped by the question, \"How much would you pay to not die?\" This is what we have, and it is impossible to sustain. So what if the value proposition was equally simple but absolutely possible: Help me, my family and friends live long and prosper.Comments (246)Arianna HuffingtonIn the preamble of the Constitution, we are told that we are constantly moving toward a more perfect union. And while people in every age think they\u0027re living in a time of transition, ours truly is an age of transition when it comes to the rights of gay Americans.Comments (247)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Why are today\u0027s Republicans so upset with an Act they designed and their patrons adore? Because it\u0027s the signature achievement of the Obama administration. There\u0027s a deep irony to all this.Comments (876)Mia Farrow and Daniel Jonah GoldhagenThere was a time when Mr. Obama expressed outrage over the mass murder and aerial bombardment of civilians in the Darfur region of western Sudan. Now President Obama has joined that silence.Comments (188)Cheech MarinActor, comedian, activist and art collectorWhile much of the nation has insurance by Allstate, Farmers, or Blue Cross, the approximately 12 million undocumented immigrants in this country have only holy water and a prayer to protect them from financial disaster.Comments (73)Cecile RichardsPresident of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, \u0026 Planned Parenthood VotesWhen it comes to Ken Cuccinelli, women in Virginia aren\u0027t buying what he\u0027s selling. Turns out the more Virginians learn about Cuccinelli\u0027s positions on women\u0027s health, the less likely they are to vote for him.Comments (363)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027It\u0027s time to be honest about the deep-seated sense of race in the heart of our national politics. But when people of color speak the truth about the realities of race in our culture and politics, they are always accused of \"playing the race card.\"Comments (384)Timothy Greenfield-SandersPhotographer and filmmakerLou Reed is with us always. It was a privilege to be his friend.CommentsFran DrescherActress and activistThe more I spoke in public forums, the more I realized that PREVENTION is the answer! Let\u0027s NOT get cancer in the first place -- How\u0027s that for a cure?Comments (12)Dan RatherHost, \u0027Dan Rather Reports\u0027In my career as a reporter, I\u0027ve been on more than a few drug raids and seen my fair share of marijuana plants. But nothing prepared me for what\u0027s growing in northern California.Comments (198)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistNothing inspires me more than a young girl who has strength, confidence and a healthy self-image. Which is why I\u0027m so proud of New York City for launching its new NYC Girls Project, a public awareness campaign designed to remind girls, ages 7 to 12, that self-esteem isn\u0027t built by slipping into a pair of designer jeans or cool shoes, but by celebrating who they are inside.CommentsAndrew BacevichAuthor, \u0027The Limits of Power: The End of American Exceptionalism\u0027The United States has been at war for well over a decade now. Yet the recent debate over Syria evoked expressions of concern in Washington that Americans were once more turning their backs on the world.Comments (100)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarSocial media-induced angst is happening with increasing frequency. Just as businesses and brands use social media to interact with their target audience and monitor consumer interest, people are using social media to gauge how their friends and acquaintances feel about them.Comments (26)James DysonInventor, Industrial designerThe UK government this week signed an agreement which means our looming energy crisis will be solved by nuclear power stations built by the French and owned, in part, by the Chinese. This demonstrates the impact of Britain\u0027s skills shortage and our lack of ambition.Comments (98)Jordan SchultzThe Huffington Post\u0027s sports columnist, The Schultz ReportLet us get one thing straight: Intent does not matter in MLB obstruction. In the first ever playoff game in MLB history to be decided by obstruction, the umpires actually got the call correct. The Boston Red Sox complained after their 5-4 loss, but the truth was they deserved to lose Game 3.CommentsKeli GoffAuthor and Special Correspondent, TheRoot.comThe words \"tasteful\" and \"understated\" are rarely used in the same sentence as the name Kardashian, so it was no surprise that the latest Kardashian-related news to dominate headlines was yet another story about over-the-top opulence, wrapped in one big, gigantic bow of questionable taste.Comments (84)Leo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersRepublicans can pummel their own party if they want to, but what\u0027s amazing is that 18 of them in the Senate and 144 in the House voted against restoring government services and paying America\u0027s debts.Comments (611)TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"Comments (264)Rachel M. MartinWriter, Findingjoy.netMotherhood is a brave journey. It\u0027s always been this brave thing to raise another independent, pushing the limits, melt your heart at night, love them forever even when they drive you crazy, human. That\u0027s what you\u0027re doing. Even on those tired days.Comments (93)Ocean RobbinsAuthor, Speaker, www.foodrevolution.orgNobody knows what\u0027s going to happen in Washington between now and November 5. But from Mexico, to Hawaii and to the 64 nations that already have GMO labeling, this tide just might be turning.Comments (751)Rep. Debbie Wasserman SchultzAuthor, \u0027For the Next Generation\u0027; Chair, Democratic National CommitteeRepublicans have held the DREAM Act back, claiming that its enactment would encourage immigration and that beneficiaries would take jobs that would have otherwise gone to American-born workers. These claims are pure paranoia, with no basis in fact.Comments (86)Gregory PatrickWriter and knitterI\u0027m sitting at Starbucks, which I rarely do. It\u0027s hard to knit there. I lot of people still find it weird for a man to be knitting in public. But, for us fellas that knit, it\u0027s nothing short of ordinary.Comments (363)Sen. Barbara BoxerU.S. Senator from California; Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works CommitteeHow much more pain and uncertainty do Americans have to endure before Congress decides that it should pay the bills it has racked up? Businesses and families must always pay their bills and so must Congress.Comments (464)Clif DickensGraphic designerComments (377)Diane RavitchHistorian, NYU professorThe international test scores are poor economic barometers. What matters most in the decades ahead is the extent to which we cultivate creativity, ingenuity, curiosity, innovation, and thinking differently.Comments (249)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorWith all these instances of Big Brother encroachment, one might want to opt out of the digital world entirely. Unfortunately, that is becoming more and more difficult in an increasingly technology-obsessed world.Comments (108)April McCormickFreelance Writer, Author and Blogger.\"First Time Mom \u0026 Dad\"After observing my toddler, and talking with other parents of toddlers, I am convinced that toddlers have the following Code of Conduct hardwired into their DNA.Comments (162)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorReflecting on the recent shutdown/debt ceiling debacle, the resolution of which is only a few months\u0027 respite until the same self-imposed deadlines reappear, you\u0027ve got to wonder: what\u0027s wrong with America?Comments (360)Aysha Akhtar, M.D., M.P.H.Neurologist, public health specialist, author \"Animals and Public Health. Why Treating Animals Better is Critical for Human Welfare\"The NFL continues to fund misleading head injury studies on animals that will not get the league closer to identifying the precise causes of brain trauma in football players and how to prevent and treat it.Comments (79)Scott Porch, 2013.27.10Elliot Grey, 2013.27.10Dr. Reese Halter, 2013.27.10William B.
