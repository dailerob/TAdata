{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jeff CohenAuthor and media criticI spent years as a political pundit on mainstream TV -- at CNN, Fox News and MSNBC. I was outnumbered, outshouted, red-baited and finally terminated. Inside mainstream media, I saw that major issues were not only dodged, but sometimes not even acknowledged to exist. Today there\u0027s an elephant in the room: a huge, yet ignored, issue that largely explains why Social Security is now on the chopping block. And why other industrialized countries have free college education and universal healthcare, but we don\u0027t. It\u0027s arguably our country\u0027s biggest problem -- a problem that Martin Luther King Jr. focused on before he was assassinated 45 years ago, and has only worsened since then (which was the height of the Vietnam War). That problem is U.S. militarism and perpetual war.Comments (390)Jennifer 8. LeeReporter, AuthorWhen I was researching my book, on Chinese food in America, The Fortune Cookie Chronicles, it puzzled me why Korean cuisine (unlike many of its Asian brethren) had not gone mainstream yet.Comments (116)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistLast year, Time magazine reported that more than a third of American women are now the family breadwinner, yet still \"lag behind men in actions crucial to building wealth and security, such as investing and having a long-term money plan.\" That\u0027s not very cheerful news.Comments (18)Allen FrancesProfessor Emeritus, Duke UniversityThis well-meaning program is a serious mistake for two reasons. First, it is no more than a politically correct, cosmetic solution that distracts attention from what really needs to be done. Second, it will likely wind up doing much more harm than good.Comments (47)Jerry KrothAssociate Professor, Graduate counseling psychology program at Santa Clara UniversityAn intelligent, rational, and balanced American president would realize -- even if he had only an introductory course in abnormal psychology -- that it is time to stop our military maneuvers in South Korea, now, immediately, and without equivocation.Comments (201)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundLet us say: \"I promise to honor the 26 lives lost at Sandy Hook Elementary School. I promise to do everything I can to encourage and support common sense solutions that make my community and our country safer from similar acts of violence.\" The gun violence prevention bills pending in Congress deserve a vote.CommentsMohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOWe are now watching the second botching of a Cyprus rescue in less than a month. The implications cannot be good for Cyprus... and for Europe as a whole.CommentsDylan RatiganNew York Times Best-Selling author, entrepreneur and formerly the host of MSNBC\u0027s The Dylan Ratigan ShowBeyond jobs, food and our vets, few things keep me up more than the disastrous functionality of our prison system. It is, after all, no secret that the U.S. houses 25 percent of the world\u0027s inmates, while representing a mere 5 percent of the world\u0027s population.Comments (19)Arianna HuffingtonThis week, as Huffington launches an ongoing series on how we can reduce the destructive force of stress in our lives, Ben Hallman looks at allegations of abuse and misconduct within an industry that began to boom when the housing market began to tank, and Lori Fradkin shares the wisdom she\u0027s gleaned in the course of attending 21 weddings.CommentsAnna Deavere SmithActress and playwrightNo matter how broken the system is, no matter how many broken moments our individual lives might survive, we all have a chance to make real the basic human drive to heal. We can do that, whatever our position in life is.CommentsBrian Levin, J.D.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityNeither America nor baseball could have any legitimacy when they deprived the dreams and opportunity of their children. At its core, baseball, like the nation that gave birth to it, is about aspirations; to teamwork, sportsmanship, merit and fair play.CommentsNina BurleighJournalist; Author, \u0027The Fatal Gift of Beauty\u0027 and forthcoming book on women and IslamistsIt\u0027s very popular right now to talk about bullying. But it is way past time to start talking about misogynist bullying as a separate category of abuse aimed at young girls, and as something that requires a separate cure.Comments (52)Martha BurkMoney Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsWas the 10-year slog, the fear from death threats and stalking, taunts, and t-shirts with our heads on pig\u0027s bodies -- and worse -- worth it? Yep. One more barrier broken, one more myth about \"woman\u0027s place\" shattered.Comments (12)Jessica ZaleskiWriter\"Glee\" attempts to tackle the issue of gun violence in our schools, but was it worthwhile, or did it feel manipulative?Comments (29)Mike LuxCo-Founder, Democracy PartnersPublic opinion matters a great deal in the American system of government, just as it does in any democracy. But it sure isn\u0027t the only thing that matters, as the following true story demonstrates. It\u0027s what I call A Tale of Two Constituencies.CommentsBob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowYesterday, the president released his 2014 budget and proposed the truly stupid idea of linking Social Security cost-of-living-adjustments to something called \"chained CPI.\" Not only is the idea a punitive one for seniors, but the president is also fueling a series of inside-D.C. myths.Comments (604)Meg FavreauWriter, comedian, and author of Little Old Lady Recipes.Omg ladies, dating is awful, right? Make sure it isn\u0027t even worse by avoiding these types of guys!!!CommentsTheodore JohnsonOp-Ed Columnist, 2012 White House FellowIt\u0027s true -- I\u0027m a black man with a watermelon for a birthmark. In many countries and cultures around the world, this would be unremarkable.Comments (25)Natalie GreggFamily lawyer, Entrepreneur and Mother of TwoIf you aren\u0027t having sex with your husband and yet your medication list at the pharmacy (or on your health insurance records) indicates that your spouse is taking erectile dysfunction pills such as Viagra, chances are he may be cheating.Comments (174)Rev. Mary Robin CraigPastor, Nankin (OH) Federated ChurchWhat have I, as a mother and a pastor, learned about care for suicide survivors in the four years since my son\u0027s death? As with almost any other form of care for others, the true gift in \"talking about suicide\" is offered in the form of \"listening about suicide.\"Comments (28)David FontanaAssociate Professor of Law at George Washington University School of Law in Washington, D.C.While Sri Srinivasan is unique, some elements of what makes him such a strong nominee and will make him a great judge are not unique, and suggest some ways forward on judicial nominations for the Obama Administration.CommentsBob BurnettBerkeley writer, retired Silicon Valley executiveThe future is arriving faster than expected. According to a report by the National Intelligence Council, Global Trends 2030, 17 years from now the world will be remarkably different. How does America plan to deal with this change?Comments (67)Rep. Charles RangelRepresentative from the 13th Congressional District in New YorkA greater tax deduction for students is not a handout. On the contrary, it helps those who are willing to meet the challenges of higher education to invest in our collective future.CommentsDr. Josef OlmertAdjunct Professor, University of South CarolinaThe recent announcement by an Iraqi Al-Qaeda group about a merger with the pro Al-Qaeda Syrian Jabhat Al-Nusrar, has refueled both the debate about Western intervention or lack thereof in the Syrian civil war, as well as the discussion about what Syria in the post-Assad era will look like.Comments (11)Jonathan KimFilm Critic for ReThink Reviews and the Uprising ShowDespite its flaws, 42 is a great illustration of a moment where America was given the choice between the right and wrong side of history, and by and large, we chose correctly.CommentsHeather LibbyManaging editor, TckTckTck.orgComments (35)Suzan Haskins and Dan PrescherInternationalLiving.com EditorsThe Internet is a wonderful thing.

Ken SalazarU.S. Secretary of the InteriorWhen I took office, too few national historic landmarks focused on the lives of women, Asian Americans, African Americans, Latinos or other diverse communities that make up the fabric of our nation.Comments (23)Fabio ParasecoliAssociate professor and coordinator of food studies, New School - NYCFried ice cream, just like the General Tso\u0027s Chicken that Jennifer 8.
