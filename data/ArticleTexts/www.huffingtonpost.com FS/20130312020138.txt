{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027It isn\u0027t Social Security and Medicare that are killing other social programs, but Republican refusal to support them. The ratio of public debt to GDP is roughly stable for the next decade. If we begin making cuts now, whether in Social Security and Medicare, or in other outlays, we will slow the recovery. That will only worsen the debt ratio over the long term, and at a depressed level of economic output. Republicans do resist higher taxes, but at times Democrats have prevailed in raising taxes on the rich -- with the full support of the voters. President Clinton managed it in 1993, and even President Obama, though he settled for too skimpy a bargain, got Republicans to vote for a $630 billion tax hike on the top one percent last January. Faced with a choice of cuts in Social Security and Medicare or tax increases on the wealthy, polls show that most voters opt for the taxes.Read Post | Comments (602)Marlo Thomas, 03/11/13Award-winning actress, author and activistHere\u0027s a riddle: A trucker is sitting in a bar next to a feminist. They\u0027ve both had a lot to drink and they\u0027re arguing. The feminist says women have been oppressed for centuries -- the trucker says they haven\u0027t. The feminist says women deserve equal pay -- the trucker says they don\u0027t. The feminist says a woman should be president -- the trucker just laughs.Read Post | Comments (874)Al Gore, 03/11/13Chairman, Generation Investment Management and The Climate Reality ProjectThe level of inequality in the U.S. is already worse than in Egypt or Tunisia, two nations rocked in recent years by popular uprisings that overthrew national governments during the Arab Spring.Read Post | Comments (837)Kim Simon, 03/10/13Mother, Wife, Blogger, mamabythebay.comYou are 3.
