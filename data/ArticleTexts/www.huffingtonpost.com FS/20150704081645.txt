{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, while the U.S. celebrates its independence, the world watches a modern Greek tragedy unfold as Greece votes on austere bailout terms imposed by the country\u0027s creditors. However the vote goes, one thing is clear: The austerity that came with the two previous bailouts has utterly broken the Greek economy. GDP has gone down nearly 30 percent. A quarter of the country is unemployed, including half of its young people. Pensions have been slashed. The health budget has been cut by 40 percent. Suicides are up 36 percent since 2008. The Troika has authored a new Greek myth -- that you can cut your way to growth. And now they\u0027re back, demanding more of what\u0027s already shattered the economy. The question is will they shatter the spirit of the Greek people? Just as we value our independence, so do the Greeks, who, after all, invented democracy. No matter the outcome of the vote, feeling some measure of control will help keep Greece\u0027s spirit alive.I am a native South Carolinian. Charleston is my maternal ancestral home.

And that came on a hot day in June, instead of a cold day in December.Political science professor, LaGrange College in GeorgiaIn order to act you must feel the a gap between what you have and what you want have, what is and what you want it to be.
