{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, America went to the polls. Despite much breathless post-election chatter about \"mandates\" and \"midterm waves,\" the really big story was not who people voted for but how many people sat this one out. With only 37 percent of eligible voters heading to the polls, turnout was the lowest it\u0027s been since 1942 -- when voters were understandably distracted. The disconnect between the governed and the government has grown to historic proportions. Why? Perhaps because of the disconnect between a \"recovering\" economy and people\u0027s daily lives. This might explain why initiatives increasing the minimum wage were passed by huge margins in all four states where they appeared on the ballot, even as candidates opposing a long-delayed increase at the federal level won. People want change, but they\u0027ve lost hope in the ability of national leaders to bring it. Those celebrating having their ticket to Washington paid for by lost faith and disillusionment should not miss this actual mandate.Bloodshed in Europe and the Middle East against the backdrop of a breakdown in the dialogue between major powers is of enormous concern. The world is on the brink of a new Cold War. Some are even saying that it\u0027s already begun.Former President of Soviet Union, Nobel LaureateThough the Wende, or \"Change,\" freed the East German people from over 40 years of Stalinist dictatorship, remembering the forgotten side of German unification -- when right-wing hooligans waged thousands of attacks on defenseless foreigners -- provides a cautionary tale of failed leadership.Writer, communications expert, writing a novel set in reunifying BerlinConflicts in faraway places matter in various ways to the United States. These conflicts matter because we recognize that violence within any particular country can quickly cause national and regional instability, displacing millions of people, upending markets.U.S. Ambassador to the United NationsPity the American people for imagining that they have just elected the new Congress. In a formal way, they of course have. The public did vote. But in a substantive way, it\u0027s not true that they have chosen their government.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia UniversityPresident, Lycabettus SocietyAlthough Republicans will now control 53 percent of the seats in the Senate, these Republican senators actually represent only 46 percent of the American people. It\u0027s a strange kind of landslide, indeed.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoMore and more people are realizing that they don\u0027t have to put their humanity on hold when they leave for work, that they\u0027re more than their résumés and that a sense of well-being and success doesn\u0027t have to come at the cost of burnout.Something has to give. We have a serious health crisis in America and it\u0027s impacting a whole lot more people than the Ebola virus.Author, Producer, AdvocateProducer and AuthorI\u0027m reminded of the old saw about being careful about what you ask for, because you might get it. If these far-right radicals are half as good at governing as they\u0027ve been at heckling from the sidelines, they\u0027ll be political superstars.Liberal political commentator, host of \"The Alan Colmes Show\" on Fox News Radio, publisher of alan.com, author of \"Thank the Liberals … For Saving America\"The European Union demonstrates a way forward: eliminating militarized borders, and expanding the safety perimeter to include everyone. Yes, everyone -- holding criminals, including dictators and terrorists, accountable to the law.Founder of OneGlobalDemocracy.comThere are infinite varieties of men or at least about 3.5 billion different ones living on Earth now, Klansmen and human rights activists, drag queens and duck hunters. For the purposes of feminism, I\u0027d like to delineate three big blurry categories.Author, \u0027Men Explain Things to Me\u0027Hating Obama should not be an effective political organizing strategy, but is indeed in the absence of any effective Democratic backbone to counter right-wing absurdities. Democrats deserve their losses; they ceded the battle before it began.Scientist and former White House Senior Policy Analyst; Ph.D. in marine biology/neurophysiologyThe Kris Maharaj case is a judicial trainwreck, and it is sadly not unique: It is past time for a wholesale reassessment of how we deal with a miscarriage of justice, and time is running out for Mr. Maharaj.Actress, activist and motherRegardless of one\u0027s party, serious citizens concerned for our country\u0027s future should be thinking seriously about where our politics are headed, not just left or right but forward or backward.United States Senator (Ret.)Heroes usually make a decision to put themselves in danger or to protect people who are in danger. But the true victims in this story -- the mountain gorillas of Virunga -- are hard to see as anything other than innocent quarry of machinations far beyond their ken.Award-Winning filmmakerHe was unique to this world, not because of his success in advertising, although some may argue that. But because he was a gentle soul, who found himself, at a very young age, searching for the meaning of man.Actress and producerDemocratic strategists have been segmenting the electorate and seeking individual self-interest-based issues in each electoral block. The strategists also keep suggesting a move to the right. This has left no room for the Democrats to have an overriding authentic moral identity that Americans can recognize.Author, The Political Mind, Moral Politics and Don\u0027t Think of an Elephant!If you\u0027ve ever wondered what Lizzie and Jane\u0027s lives would have been like if their overbearing mother could reach them 24/7 to discuss their dwindling marriage prospects, look no further than Ortberg\u0027s wonderfully playful book. The only thing missing? Bridal emojis.Co-creator of The ToastTo seal the deal and truly begin to close a harrowingly destructive chapter in American history, voters going to the ballot box Tuesday need to understand how the War on Drugs has failed, in every way, for over 40 years.Award-winning filmmaker, public thinker, and authorTomorrow, I will miss the bonding experience that is nursing my baby. Instead, she will struggle to eat (she doesn\u0027t do well with the bottle) as I rush throughout my day to pump for her in a small, confined space. The thought of this alone makes my heart hurt and my frustrations rise.Mother and writerNearly 80 percent of the country is not divided, but actually united on many issues. So why are we always led to believe otherwise? How does this affect us personally and as a nation? And what are we to do about correcting this grand illusion?Host and Producer of Between the Lines with Barry Kibrick seen on PBS.Enough is enough. By suing the New York Post, I hope to also send a message to other news outlets that they cannot get away with maligning celebrities for the sheer fun of it and maliciously ruin an individual\u0027s reputation in the effort to garner page views.Grammy-winning rapperAs Bob Herbert tells us, we have lost our way. Our elected officials dream no big dreams. They have little or no concept of major public works programs to rebuild our nation\u0027s infrastructure, which would put millions of people to work and invigorate our economy.Research Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027There are essentially three primary reasons why Republicans enjoyed such an impressive victory on election night.Television political commentator, radio talk show host, lecturer, political analystWe have seen the rise of a community known as the disgruntled commenter, the one who picks fights, hates the writing, never has anything nice (or productive) to say. But that\u0027s the price we pay and, well, I\u0027ve come to realize it\u0027s a relatively small one.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarSo far there haven\u0027t been very many progressives willing to stick their head out there and say they\u0027re willing to take on Team Hillary. I understand that the Washington media is saying that she can\u0027t be beat. That\u0027s hilarious. Isn\u0027t that exactly what they said in 2008?Host, \u0027The Young Turks\u0027If the Republican Party takes full control of the U.S. Congress in the midterm election, policy gridlock is likely to worsen, risking a rerun of the damaging fiscal battles that led last year to a government shutdown and almost to a technical debt default. More broadly, the gridlock will prevent the passage of important structural reforms that the U.S. needs to boost growth.Chairman of Roubini Global Economics, Professor of Economics at the Stern School of BusinessWhen politics has gone bankrupt and finds its extension in fratricidal war, there is only one way forward, which is to make everyone understand that no one can win alone and that salvation, and suicide alike, can only be collective.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.The LGBT community absolutely needs to combat the misogyny in their midst. I\u0027ve lived and breathed gay rights for as long as I can remember. I\u0027ve seen so much change and now I want more. Casual and accepted misogyny no longer works for me and it shouldn\u0027t work for you.Actress; Director of this year\u0027s Sundance selected short film \u0027Dawn\u0027She was Yolande, daughter of the King of Aragon before the country joined with Castile to make today\u0027s Spain. The only child of her father to reach adulthood, Yolande became the kingdom\u0027s heiress after the death of her childless uncle.Author and Historian; author of the acclaimed Anjou Trilogy and frequent lecturer and historical writer.Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"25 YEARS LATER",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
