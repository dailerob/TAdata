{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"The White House has the ultimate PR weapon -- the president\u0027s bully pulpit. But he seems unwilling to use it when it comes to the jobs crisis, especially Congress\u0027 unwillingness to extend unemployment benefits. Why aren\u0027t he and his administration doing everything possible to make it impossible for Congress not to pass the extension?
