{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"I\u0027m delighted to announce HuffPost\u0027s latest e-book, Beyond The Battlefield: The War Goes on for the Severely Wounded, by David Wood. As HuffPost\u0027s senior military correspondent, David spent nine months speaking with severely wounded veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as their families, military surgeons, combat medics, rehabilitation therapists, prosthetics engineers, nurses, and medical officials at the Pentagon and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The result is both grim and inspiring, heartbreaking and optimistic. It speaks to the amazing resilience of the human spirit in the face of war\u0027s persistent horrors -- the kind of horrors that go on long after the troops come home. Through his portraits of wounded soldiers, their loved ones and their caretakers, and through his portrayals of the dangerous conditions in which they serve and the trying world to which they return, David has crafted an immensely valuable mosaic of a vital segment of American life.Read Post | Comments (21)Marcin Jakubowski and Isaiah Saxon, 12/19/11There is a growing desire around the world to fundamentally remix this relationship with machines and specialization -- to increase access, engagement, and understanding.Read Post | CommentsBridget van Kralingen, 12.18.2011General Manager, IBM North AmericaCollaboration between the public and private sectors has long served as the model for addressing major challenges faced by the U.S. But in today\u0027s political and economic environment, is it a thing of the past?Read Post | Comments (1)Carne Ross, 12/19/11Founder, Independent Diplomat; Author, \u0027The Leaderless Revolution\u0027The enemy in the West that must be conquered is not a dictator, both easily identified and caricatured.

U.S. Senator from DelawareI have never quite been able to understand how the decision was made to fire Richard Wagoner at GM but not Vikram Pandit at Citibank. Is running a huge bank really more complex than running a huge automobile manufacturer?Read Post | Comments (63)Heather Bauer, RD, CDN, 12/18/11Nutritionist, Entrepreneur, Author, Mother of ThreeThat chic LBD you scored on Gilt back in November is hanging in the closet just waiting to dazzle your cohorts.
