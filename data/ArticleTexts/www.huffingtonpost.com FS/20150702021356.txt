{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Overtime pay has become such a rarity that many Americans don\u0027t even realize that the majority of salaried workers were once eligible for it. We just keep working longer and harder, for less. A recent Gallup poll found that salaried Americans now report working an average of 47 hours a week -- not the supposedly standard 40 -- while 18 percent of Americans report working more than 60 hours a week. Meanwhile, corporate profits have doubled over the last three decades -- from about 6 percent of GDP to about 12 percent -- while wages have fallen by almost exactly the same amount. The erosion of overtime and other labor protections is one of the main factors worsening inequality. A higher overtime threshold will help reverse this trend.Kelly Bulkeley is a dream researcher and visiting scholar at the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, California. In answer to my questions, he shared his insights on the practice of dream incubation, the phrase \"sleep on it,\" and connection between sleep and wakefulness.Roland Dupree wasn\u0027t a household name. But \"legendary\" fits. As a performer, a teacher and as a real life success story, he deserves to be remembered and honored among Hollywood\u0027s greatest not only because of what he accomplished, but how he accomplished it.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027Central to celebrating Pride is recognizing the work that is yet to be done. Not until every American -- whether gay, straight, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender -- is treated equally under the law will we fully realize our potential as a nation.Senior Advisor to the President and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsI was raised to be a strong, black woman who could handle her own emotions -- not ask someone to help me sort them out. How dare I need treatment for feeling worthless and for being bullied when I come from a lineage of ancestors who used strength and endurance as a way to survive?Social Worker, Founder of Respect Your StruggleThe NYPL, like many other libraries around the country, has already begun to seize the day in an effort to answer the needs and wants of its community.Author, \u0027Dreaming in Chinese\u0027We must never forget the genocide in Srebrenica. We must always honor its victims, its survivors. But we must never forget also that our words will ring hollow if, in the here and now, we don\u0027t believe the unbelievable, if we don\u0027t end the culture of impunity that exists in so many places around the world, and if we don\u0027t strengthen our resolve to protect those who count on us all.U.S. Permanent Representative to the United NationsDoing away with official reverence for the Confederate battle flag is largely a symbolic move that doesn\u0027t come close to addressing the problems surrounding race in America, including disparities in treatment by the criminal justice system and the resurgence of voter suppression laws and other schemes designed to rig the elections in favor of powerful conservative interests.President, People For the American WayThe governor is not asking for the federal government to bail them out of this problem. Puerto Rico only asking for the right to declare bankruptcy, which is the same right that states have. Because Puerto Rico is not a state, it cannot avail itself of the provision in federal bankruptcy law that enables cities like Detroit to restructure its debt in an orderly fashion.Representative from the 13th Congressional District in New YorkWhat tastes good is not always good, and what is good does not always taste good. That\u0027s why you need a science of nutrition. If you eat automatically, guided by instinct, you will get in trouble. To grow healthy and strong you need to eat consciously.Founder and Chairman, Conscious Business Center InternationalWhen the EEOC began recognizing that discrimination against trans persons was a form of sex discrimination, the community was nearly completely silent. When cases began being won, the silence continued; the issue was avoided when it wasn\u0027t being misrepresented.Executive Director, Gender Rights MarylandThe United States is the wealthiest nation in the history of the world. Why are we so far behind so many other countries when it comes to meeting the needs of working families and the American middle class?Democratic candidate for President, US Senator from VermontTwo days after the Supreme Court\u0027s historic marriage equality decision, my friends\u0027 Isaac and Rich\u0027s upstate New York wedding was certainly peppered with pride. But Isaac and Rich weren\u0027t interested in serving as the post-decision poster couple.Editor, HuffPost ImpactIt may not be a breakdown, but it is undoubtedly an unveiling: Europe is abandoning its State of Grace, its Olympus of Rules, and doing something that in the language of international politics is brutally labeled \"meddling.\"L\u0027Huffington Post Editorial DirectorThe story of the church and LGBT rights is also my story. I first came back to church as a gay, recovering alcoholic. My cousins invited me to a UCC/ABC church in New York City, and by some miracle, I actually went. I was wary. But once inside, I came to love the church for teaching me that I was beautifully and wonderfully made; and that to love myself and care for myself was a form of gratitude to my Creator. Years later, after I had been with my partner for 11 years, I was married in the Episcopal church we now attend, and It was one of the most moving events of my life.Executive Editor Of Global Spirituality and Religion, The Huffington PostTEL AVIV - As we reach the one-year anniversary since the announcement of ISIS, much of the commentary has been far too ephemeral, taking whatever comes out immediately in the news as indicative of long-term trends. ISIS is neither winning nor losing. Like any long war, there is much ebb and flow.Research fellow, Middle East ForumFor years, oil and gas corporations have been degrading our cherished public lands with the destructive oil and gas drilling method known as fracking. This has seriously impacted our public lands and groundwater, and areas buffering America\u0027s most precious national parks and monuments are at increasingly grave risk.Has represented south central Wisconsin in Congress since 2012Executive Director, Food \u0026 Water WatchWe\u0027re not always at our best as parents. We repeat ourselves often, knowing the result will be the same. I\u0027m but a parent to young kids but I\u0027ve done research and I know of 11 ridiculous things all parents of kids under six have said. I know because I\u0027ve said them all and I\u0027m a parent and therefore (science explanation that\u0027s probably wrong)...Father of two and blogger at PuzzlingPosts.comIt is no longer wise, therefore, for the European Union, a superpower currently in limbo, with recessionist circumstances prevailing, to continue tormenting the Greek people in its strategic southern periphery instead of offering to us all a real chance to spark off prosperity both in Greece and the rest of Europe.Emeritus Professor of Economics, University of AthensI lost my mother to Alzheimer\u0027s in 1998. My father cared for her every day in our living room for thirteen years, a situation experienced every day by the tens of millions of Americans who care for a loved one with Alzheimer\u0027s disease.Senator Edward J. Markey of MassachusettsStart with a notion that\u0027s a bit counter-intuitive. To become an effective travel bargain hunter, planning is essential. In fact, embrace travel as a hobby, looking for tricks, techniques and current online resources to keep abreast of the best last-minute deals. Here\u0027s how to begin.Vice President, Visa Inc.Rather than responsibly dealing with the economic challenges facing New Jersey, Governor Christie has played politics with workers\u0027 retirement security and cut investments in infrastructure that would promote economic growth.Executive Director of the National Public Pension Coalition.Currently, the Federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour or roughly $15,000 annually, far below the $23,500 government\u0027s poverty threshold for a family of four. Some candidates have already made their positions on the minimum wage clear, but there are many that still have not.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorAt last, after years of blackmailing Greece and demanding ever more austerity that led to a catastrophic economic depression, the Troika has finally pushed the country into the brink of default. The situation has some important similarities with Argentina\u0027s 2001 default -- and some differences as well.Professor at Columbia University and a Nobel Laureate in EconomicsPostdoctoral Research Fellow Columbia University GSBNow the risks of obesity are real. But can we rely on a single number to tell us if someone is overweight? How reliable is BMI really?Board Certified in Internal MedicineAs a working TV and feature film writer in Hollywood, I have been fortunate enough to sell a couple of pilots to NBC. But I am also one of those immigrants from Mexico Donald Trump talked about -- except I\u0027ve never raped anyone, I am not a criminal and I have never done or sold drugs.Writer/Executive Producer of the award-winning film \"La Misma Luna\" (\"Under the Same Moon\"), Humanitas Prize WinnerRight now, too many Americans are working long days for less pay than they deserve. That\u0027s partly because we\u0027ve failed to update overtime regulations for years -- and an exemption meant for highly paid, white collar employees now leaves out workers making as little as $23,660 a year -- no matter how many hours they work.44th President of the United StatesTechnology companies say they will use the Internet of Things to improve our energy usage, health, security, and lifestyle and habits. In reality, companies such as Apple and Google want to learn all they can about us so that they can market more products and services to us -- and sell our data to others.Academic, Researcher, Writer, EntrepreneurThe fact that you have the time, money and passport needed to travel doesn\u0027t mean that the world is at your disposal.Traveler, teacher and thrill-seekereHarmony Gabe\u0027s soul is every bit as kind as I had anticipated. There is also every bit as much chemistry between the two of us as I had anticipated -- er, every bit as little? There is zero chemistry. Just zero.WriterMore often than not, there are a handful of fundamental actions every employee should be taking that these employees are neglecting.
