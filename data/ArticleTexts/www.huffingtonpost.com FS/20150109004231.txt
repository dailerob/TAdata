The oil and gas industry pumped $53.1 million into last year\u0027s congressional campaigns--87 percent of which went to Republican candidates. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell raked in $608,000 from the industry for his 2014 campaign, and now he is putting Keystone XL at the heart of his big polluter agenda.

A lot.practical dreamer. hopeful realist. ravishly.com co-editor.The news media has been hard at work tracking down the handful of protesters and others who did or even wrote something violent in order to stereotype the entire Black Lives Matter movement as violent. And when there isn\u0027t something, the news media has resorted to doctoring footage.Vice President, New Business Initiatives, Bill Lynch Associates, LLCAlready on the horizon we see Islamophobes and skeptics of Islam taking great lengths to announce that all of this can be blamed on Islam. But I must emphasize, through this short opinion piece, that Muslims support Charlie Hebdo.Asif Arif is a lawyer in Paris and director of the website Cultures \u0026 Beliefs. He is the author of the book \"L\u0027Ahmadiyya: un Islam interdit.\"Preventing these catastrophes will involve sustained and dedicated effort by all those who truly care about the future of humanity.
