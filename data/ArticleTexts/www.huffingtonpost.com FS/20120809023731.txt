Well, as it turns out, you don\u0027t always get what you pay for. Even before the Olympics have ended, the political press corps has already turned its attention to its favorite sport: the VP speculation marathon. Soon, we will enter the season of polls, polls, polls -- interrupted only by the debates, which should become another opportunity for the media to zero in on which candidate made the biggest gaffe and which candidate delivered the zingiest zinger. Meanwhile, 11 million homeowners are underwater. So, what is the opportunity cost of the media\u0027s obsession with polls, gaffes and speculation?Read Post | CommentsBob Cesca, 08/08/12Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez Show, Media ProducerOver the weekend, Mitt Romney, while clearly benefiting from Republican voter purges and Voter ID laws meant to discourage minority and working class voters, accused the Obama Justice Department of somehow trying to disenfranchise military voters -- his biggest lie yet.Read Post | Comments (83)Lisa Belkin, 08/08/12Senior columnist for life/work/family, The Huffington PostDo you speak differently with your children about gender than your parents spoke to you?

One option is a candidate who promises to turn back the clock on women\u0027s rights and our access to health care. Thankfully, we have a far better option: President Obama.Read Post | Comments (2,358)Dr. Michael J.

He has decided that I\u0027m rooting for America\u0027s decline and that I\u0027m a part of President Barack Obama\u0027s \"crop of Democrats.\" None of that is true, but it\u0027s worth recounting how Rush and I got to this point.Read Post | Comments (1,623)X PRIZE Foundation, 08/08/12Solving the world’s Grand ChallengesFacial detection technology is making it feasible to do real-time measurement and analysis of advertisements in the physical world and predict the products you will want to buy, based on who you are or what you look like.Read Post | CommentsDorothy Zinberg, 08/08/12Lecturer in Public Policy, Harvard Kennedy SchoolBob Hughes, when he stormed Provincetown, showed us what life looked like when lived through a mega-magnifying glass.Read Post | CommentsMatthew Dowd, 08/08/12Political strategistIf you look at historical precedents, Gov.
