{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOObama has often said that he is running because of what Dr. King called \"the fierce urgency of now.\" He needs to show that fierceness and that urgency. When we think of King, we usually think of him as resolute and dignified. But King was also filled with a prophetic anger, especially in the later years of his life. As a leader fighting for fundamental change in this country, Obama has to be willing to show us that kind of righteous anger. I don\u0027t know about you, but when I think about what George Bush has done to this country -- and what John McCain wants to keep doing -- I consider outrage the only rational and legitimate response.

Regardless of the outcome of this thing, it\u0027s clear that half of America is falling for the same superficial trickery that gave us eight years of George W. Bush. You know the routine.Read Post | Comments (1203)BIODiana Meehan, 09.11.2008The narrative McCain promotes is a well-known myth of the American West: small town is threatened by outsiders from the Eastern establishment, corrupt and dangerous outlaws and craven townspeople.Read Post | Comments (23)BIOTempted Wife, 09.11.2008I am in love with someone other than my husband.
