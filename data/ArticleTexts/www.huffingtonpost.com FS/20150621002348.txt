{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor of Law at The George Washington University Law School; Senior Fellow at DemosProgram Director, Joyce FoundationThere is compelling evidence that policies to make it harder to acquire guns save lives. Research shows that states that require all gun buyers to pass background checks, issue licenses to gun owners, and regulate gun sellers have lower rates of gun crime and violence. A recent study by Johns Hopkins University found that Connecticut\u0027s handgun permit law reduced firearm homicides by an astounding 40 percent. When Missouri repealed a similar law, gun homicides increased by 25 percent. When states fail to pass laws that effectively restrict access to illegal guns, and instead enact laws to make it easier to buy and carry guns, they fail to sufficiently value Black lives and the lives of other Americans adversely affected by gun crime and violence. South Carolina\u0027s firearm homicide rate ranks 11th in the nation. It is no coincidence that it also has among the weakest gun laws.What happened to our family is part of a larger attack on Black and Brown bodies. To impact change, we must recognize the connection between racism, hate crimes and racialized policing. While the focus for this specific attack was on African-Americans, we all have a responsibility to seek not only justice for the victims, but an end to racial injustice.Family of Rev. Depayne MiddletonWhy are people willing to pay for the right to put their message on a license plate, rather than just put it on a bumper sticker? Justice Breyer suggests that it is because they want the state\u0027s endorsement of their message. The problem, though, is that this is about the state discriminating among private speakers based on whether it approves or disapproves of the message. This, the First Amendment does not permit.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoPositive and constructive approaches offer a way to strengthen journalism, at a time when more than ever, we need a way of looking at the world that sparks the potential in us all.Editor-in-chief of Positive News, co-founder of the Constructive Journalism ProjectIn the wake of the horrendous racist terrorist attack on Charleston\u0027s historic Emanuel AME church that left nine innocent African-American churchgoers and leaders dead, many questions have arisen about hate crimes and extremism in the United States. Here are some answers.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityThe Global Moms Relay is one of my favorite HuffPost traditions, a collaborative effort to tap into our collective gratitude and love, not only for our own mothers, but for all mothers around the world. This year\u0027s theme is \"What kind of world do you want for your family in 2030?\" And we\u0027re using the HuffPost platform to bring more and more voices into this conversation and harness the power of social media for good.Violent attacks against African American spaces of worship have a long and persistent history in our nation. Beginning in the 18th century, there is documented evidence of white citizens targeting black religious gatherings with both legal sanctions and terroristic methods.Plummer Professor of Christian Morals and Pusey Minister in the Memorial Church of Harvard UniversityDad would be so proud to see how we\u0027ve come together, and grown, since his passing. I imagine him sitting back, with a big smile on his face, marveling at how we\u0027ve healed and how we\u0027ve taken his biggest dream -- prizing family above all else -- and made it a reality.Editorial Director, Lifestyle; The Huffington PostThe Confederacy was the most vile and harmful political invention in United States history. It was founded on the explicit principle that slavery is the \"natural and normal condition\" of black people, and that they should be ruthlessly exploited to the benefit of their white masters. Where in that story arc is anything worth celebrating?Senior Editor for Projects \u0026 Investigations, The Huffington PostIn a crime that has outraged locals, a sniper has reportedly shot down the beloved Confederate flag that traditionally graces the Statehouse in Columbia, South Carolina. \"This was clearly one very disturbed individual,\" said Council Chairman Harvey \"Harve\" Jeffcoat. \"And I can tell you with certainty that he does not represent our community.\"Novelist, Amnesia, Milrose Munce, GalunkerAs U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan put it, \"I am increasingly worried that our teachers, our administrators don\u0027t reflect the great diversity of our nation\u0027s students, and that is a real problem.\"President, Children\u0027s Defense FundThat\u0027s what inspired President Obama to launch the My Brother\u0027s Keeper Initiative (MBK) -- an initiative I am proud to lead. As someone who grew up without a dad, and then made the decision to take on the joy and responsibility of being an active, engaged father in the lives of his daughters, the President understands that we have the power to break old cycles. We have the power to change the narrative.Assistant to the President and Cabinet Secretary; Chair of the My Brother’s Keeper Task ForceWhen the U.S.\u0027 murder rate and mass shooting rates are stacked up against the rest of the world, it becomes clear that we not only have a problem -- we have a sickness -- and it is killing us, literally. And yet we go from mass killing to mass killing, numb for a day, and then we move on.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Imprisoning a staggering number of our people is wrong. The way our nation does it is even worse. We must end mass incarceration, now.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Racism is not a mental illness. Unlike actual mental illnesses, it is taught and instilled. Mental illness was not the state policy of South Carolina, or any state for that matter, for hundreds of years -- racism was.Staff Reporter, The Huffington PostAthens has a unique aura of the past mixed into the present. So here is my list of my favorite places, some lesser known than others but nevertheless worthy of exploration.Student at New York UniversityI know my father died a hero. Even after being shot multiple times, he courageously fought off the gunman, saving many, including my mother, at the expense of his own life. He defended the temple he founded, and this house of worship is the gift he left to us and his grandchildren. Just like Felicia Sanders. She sacrificed her body to cover and shield her young granddaughter, as her son, Tywanza, tried to talk down the gunman.Community Organizer, Filmmaker, ActivistYou could wonder if her loyalists had been unaware of another possible reading of the metaphor presented by the sight of Roosevelt Island against the skyline of Wall Street -- something her handlers didn\u0027t intend: A mockery of the words she was speaking at that very minute.Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanySenior writer, Moyers \u0026 Company on public TV. Senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.It\u0027s hard to believe that it\u0027s been 24 years since I picked out a Father\u0027s Day card. I always enjoyed that ritual of choosing just the right one--funny or loving--that I knew my dad would enjoy.Award-winning actress, author and activistAs soon as I heard about the mass killing of nine worshipers at Charleston\u0027s Emanuel AME Church, my heart broke -- again. Yet another gunman, yet another place that should be safe from violence, even more families shattered. No more Charlestons. No more Newtowns, Auroras or Isla Vistas. Not one more.Founder, Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in AmericaPro-gun mouthpieces couldn\u0027t even wait 24 hours after the unspeakable event to begin peddling a shabby version of \"they got what they probably deserved.\" But the simple fact of the matter is that mass shootings aren\u0027t supposed to happen in churches or schools. These places are sanctuaries in every sense of the word.Mike the Gun GuyIf TPP passes the Senate, other attempts to regulate commerce for the common good will be potentially gutted as well, from attempts at financial regulation to limits on the prices charged for drugs, to environmental rules and seemingly innocuous actions like requiring accurate labeling.Author, \u0027Soul of a Citizen\u0027 and \u0027The Impossible Will Take a Little While\u0027As the Charleston community comes together in mourning, it is important to also come together to reflect on how such a tragedy could happen in the first place, and what must be done at a larger, societal level to prevent this from happening again.Tracy Fehr Sardone is a human rights practitioner and independent journalist. She currently resides in Charleston, SC.Unarmed black men and women are shot in the street almost weekly for nonviolent crimes and the mainstream nation tells us they had it coming. But a shooter who kills 9 people at church is a tragic display of wayward youth and mental illness.Writer, Filmmaker, Actress - Brave New Films; The ProtologEstablished by Reverend Richard Allen, a former slave and Methodist preacher, the A.M.E. is the oldest black denomination in the country. Its roots lie in one of the first black religious and mutual help societies, the Free African Society founded by Philadelphia blacks in 1787.Manisha Sinha is Professor of Afro-American Studies and History at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.Every kid growing up in a South Asian household knows there is a certain four-letter word you shan\u0027t utter. No, it\u0027s not the f-word, and no it doesn\u0027t rhyme with hit. It\u0027s the l-word: love.Associate Editor, Huff/Post 50If ISIS had killed 547 Americans in 2013, we\u0027d have sent tens of thousands of Americans back to Iraq, so why do we simply shrug our shoulders at hundreds of murders that aren\u0027t linked to a terrorist group?Columnist and author published in The Hill, The Baltimore Sun, The Jerusalem Post, Salon, and other publicationsBlack Churches have been under attack for hundreds of years, dating back to slavery. Be it bombings during the civil rights movement, or Black Churches being set on fire, the Black Church has been under perpetual attack since its inception.Author, Speaker, Coach, ConsultantTo all of you who have lost a father whom you have loved dearly and who showed you that love right back, I hope you can embrace Father\u0027s Day with a spirit of gratitude and courage. In my father, God gave me the greatest gift ever: an angel to watch over me. And, this Sunday, I will celebrate him.Emmy Award-winning journalist, producer and TV hostI remember when the news out of Ferguson, Missouri first came to us. I heard white friends and colleagues encourage each other to sit in a posture of listening. I honor that listening. White allies, I thank you for your thoughtfulness in this regard. Now allow me to be your stopwatch; time\u0027s up.Teaching Elder, Presbyterian Church (USA); Pastor, Unity Presbyterian Church in Temple Hills, MarylandThe last time that we had large and growing inequality was during the so-called Roaring Twenties, which ended with the Great Depression. As part of the response, we enacted Social Security. We should learn from the past.Founding Co-director, Social Security WorksGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
