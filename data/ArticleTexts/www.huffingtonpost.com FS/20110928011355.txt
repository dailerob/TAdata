{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Back in the middle of August, just after Rick Perry tossed his cowboy hat into the ring, anonymous White House and Obama campaign aides were quoted saying that they welcomed the Texas governor into the race because they assumed that, given his radical positions, he would be easier to beat. After all, the man does have more than his share of extreme positions.

Both charges are mistaken.Read Post | Comments (602)Bill Gates, 9/27/11Co-chair of the Bill \u0026 Melinda Gates FoundationThe numbers don\u0027t lie.
