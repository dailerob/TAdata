{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Robert L. BorosagePresident, Institute for America\u0027s FutureCorporate profits are up, but wages aren\u0027t. Wages are now at the lowest percent of the economy on record. The median wage hasn\u0027t budged this century. College and non-college grads are now losing ground. The good jobs that were lost are being replaced by low-wage and part-time jobs. Young people are starting out behind, unemployed or underemployed at ruinous high rates. Our Gilded Age inequality is getting worse, with the top 1 percent pocketing all of the rewards of growth. We need dramatic reforms to make this economy work for working people. Americans won\u0027t recover without a dramatic change in course. And that will require the Republicans who control the Congress to get out of the way and the Democrats who control the Senate to get better vision and stronger backbones.Comments (174)Gary HartPresident, Hart International, Ltd.It is dangerous to have a technology-empowered government capable of amassing private data; it is even more dangerous to privatize this Big Brother world.Comments (70)Padmasree WarriorChief Technology Officer, CiscoNMSI reports that men over age 25 held 87 percent of bachelor\u0027s degrees in engineering fields. Only 23 percent of workers in STEM-related jobs are women, yet women make up 48 percent of workers in all occupations. The higher you go on the corporate ladder, the lower these numbers become. You don\u0027t need to be a math whiz to see that these numbers don\u0027t add up.Comments (2)Maureen RyanTV critic, The Huffington PostIt\u0027s not just that Gandolfini was transfixing as Tony Soprano -- he was transfixing in so many ways.Comments (34)Bevis LongstrethFormer SEC CommissionerReal hope for global action now rests with the private sector. To save the planet, we need to create a global movement of ordinary people demanding action now. The people, young and old, rich and poor, must seize power over global policy by taking control away from the fossil fuel companies who now wield it.Comments (343)Ester BloomWriter; Full of Pith and VinegarBe a dude, ideally dead. Questions to ask yourself: What\u0027s the body count? Are your characters suffering? Add more violence. Are your characters sufficiently coarsened by the inequities of modern life? Add more profanity.Comments (11)Cecile RichardsPresident of Planned Parenthood Federation of America and Planned Parenthood Action FundThese bills are more than staggering. They have nothing to do with protecting women. They will not promote health care. They are dangerous, they are extreme, and women are already paying the price in states where they have been enacted.Comments (152)Arianna HuffingtonThe biggest movie of the summer isn\u0027t Man of Steel, or The Lone Ranger, or Fast \u0026 Furious 6. It\u0027s a new documentary called How to Make Money Selling Drugs, and it exposes the hypocrisy, insanity, and destructiveness of America\u0027s drug war.Comments (353)Rep. Debbie Wasserman SchultzU.S. Representative from Florida\u0027s 23rd Congressional DistrictWhen I was diagnosed with breast cancer, I was advised to be tested for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations. Like thousands of women before me, and thousands since, I had the devastating experience of making life-altering decisions based on the results of one test.Comments (31)Elliott NeginDirector of News \u0026 Commentary, Union of Concerned ScientistsLast week, the House decided to throw good money after bad. Tucked inside its defense authorization bill was a provision that allocates funding for a new ground-based missile defense site -- despite the fact that missile defense brass don\u0027t want the money.Comments (14)Adam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; founder of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911If you\u0027re planning to take a trip this summer, you need some commandments of your own to protect yourself and your family from identity thieves.CommentsAnn BrenoffSenior Writer, The Huffington PostWhile diet and lifestyle choices play a factor, research shows that it\u0027s genetics that determines how long we get to stick around. The genes in my family suggest that I\u0027m here for a good long while -- which I\u0027m not so sure would be my first choice.Comments (85)Lydia LoizidesFounder \u0026 CEO of GGGritMy mother once told me, \"When people share their lives with you, it means they trust you. Trust is more important than money.\" At the time, I had no idea what she meant.CommentsAmy EphronAuthorThis week\u0027s stunning news that the FBI is using drones as a surveillance tool in the United States almost veered into black comedy -- certainly ripe for a song parody, or rather a parody-song-medley.Comments (13)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesIt\u0027s terrific news that Exodus International, the largest and most known group that promoted \"reparative therapy,\" is shutting down. But don\u0027t be fooled into thinking this is anything more than a re-branding for the \"pray-away-the-gay\" movement. It\u0027s certainly not a surrender.Comments (40)Rabbi Shmuley BoteachRabbi and WriterWe need to find a balance: look for terrorists, employ surveillance where there\u0027s an absolute need to, monitor where there is a legitimate threat. But stop believing that the American population in general needs to be followed and stalked.Comments (16)Mike RyanSenior Entertainment Writer, The Huffington PostIt\u0027s embarrassing to admit when the death of a famous person -- basically, a stranger -- affects me emotionally. I can name them all right now: John Ritter, Tim Russert, Roger Ebert and, now, James Gandolfini.CommentsMuhammad YunusNobel Peace Prize winner and founder of Grameen BankGrameen Bank has been built with the funds of the poor women. How can the Inquiry Commission propose to hand over the majority shares of an organization which is owned 97 percent by private citizens to the government?CommentsPepe EscobarRoving correspondent for the Asia TimesSun Tzu, the ancient author of The Art of War, must be throwing a rice wine party in his heavenly tomb in the wake of the shirtsleeves California love-in between President Obama and President Xi Jinping. \"Know your enemy\" was, it seems, the theme of the meeting.CommentsAmitai EtzioniProfessor of international relations, George Washington UniversityThe libertarian rank hypocrisy runs much deeper and further than the post-tornado cries for help in Oklahoma, which surely deserve our sympathy. And it needs yet another debunking.Comments (83)Raymond J. LearsyAuthor, \u0027Oil and Finance: The Epic Corruption Continues\u0027The price of oil, and in turn gasoline, continues on its clearly speculation-driven trajectory. A significant break in the price of oil would be an enormous boost to the economy.CommentsBoyan S. BenevStrategist, writer and speaker based in Sofia, BulgariaIt seems the world is out on the street, protesting for change. From Taksim Square in Istanbul, through the streets of Athens and Rio to the catastrophe in Syria one theme stands out: protesters clashing with aggressive and often brutal police and government forces.Comments (20)Alina TugendAuthor, \u0027Better by Mistake: The Unexpected Benefits of Being Wrong\u0027Being so hard on ourselves reflects the great fear many of us having of falling short. And one of the key obstacles all of us are going to have to overcome to be healthier and happier is to accept that not only do we all make mistakes, but we must do so in order to create and take risks.CommentsTurk PipkinWriter, filmmaker, co-founder of The Nobelity ProjectI was just a tiny cog in the great wheel that was The Sopranos, just one of thousands who James Gandolfini treated with kindness and respect. There are few so great who remain so humble, who are able to grasp their own incredible abilities and still recognize them as a gift.CommentsDavid SableGlobal CEO, Y\u0026RDigital is about our lives; what we do as human beings day in and day out; adding value to our existence and no longer about the technology and its whiz bang features.CommentsTony NewmanDirector of Media Relations, Drug Policy AllianceThe marijuana reform movement has broken through as a legitimate political and cultural force. We\u0027re at a tipping point where it\u0027s starting to feel like marijuana legalization is no longer a question of if -- but when. But what about the other drugs?Comments (43)Robin BronkCEO, The Creative CoalitionIn order to live life, one must experience art.CommentsMark SissonFormer elite marathoner and triathlete; Author, \u0027The Primal Blueprint\u0027We do not need grains to survive, let alone thrive. In fact, they are naturally selected to ward off pests, whether they be insects or hominids. I suggest we take the hint and stop eating them.Comments (246)Craig NewmarkFounder, craigslist and craigconnects.orgYou can use something like TurboTax to do your own taxes. You get the right records, and use their software to submit an entire package. Veterans Affairs is now deploying something real similar.CommentsTammy BleckWitty Woman WritingTry not to criticize yourself, second guess your feelings, doubt your abilities or be too hard on yourself when you think you\u0027ve failed. The world does all those things for you and it is your job to stand up to it, not give in to it.Comments (25)FoodbeastWho knew that a two-dimensional cartoon character could cause such a monumental controversy? Luckily, Cap\u0027n Crunch himself reached out to us to set things straight.Comments (16)Christopher HayesHost, \u0027All In with Chris Hayes\u0027The 33-year-old reporter and author died early Tuesday morning in a car wreck -- a brutal, tragic loss that has robbed the world of an exemplary journalist, and singularly talented writer. He wrote detailed, diligent, riveting reportorial prose and he was also kind, generous, charming and earnest.Comments (28)Jay Michaelson, 2013.20.06Christopher Caen, 2013.20.06Matt Baume, 2013.20.06Waymon Hudson, 2013.20.06Richard J.
