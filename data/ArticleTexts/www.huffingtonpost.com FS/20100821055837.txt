{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-Director of the Center for Economic and Policy ResearchThe middle class is getting whacked by the Great Recession. Fifteen million people are out of work, another 9 million workers can only find part-time jobs, and millions more have given up looking for work altogether. This pain is infuriating for two reasons.
