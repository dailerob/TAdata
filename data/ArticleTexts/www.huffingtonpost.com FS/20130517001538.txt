{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"David BromwichProfessor of Literature at YaleThree scandals have converged in the past week to preoccupy Congress and the press. Benghazi was the first to come, and it has surprised by its staying power. The abuse of power by the IRS may be, in the long run, the most damaging of these cases for the Obama presidency, but its outlines are only beginning to emerge. But the ugliest of the scandals has come from the revelation of the justice department\u0027s seizure of two months of phone calls by 100 AP reporters. This was done to investigate the leak of a thwarted terrorist plot which the government itself had already decided to disclose in public. Different as they are, the scandals all point to a single disorder that afflicts the Obama White House and the Holder justice department. The name of the disorder is paternalism, and its leading symptoms are suppression and secrecy.CommentsBob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowThe congressional Republicans are outraged by the IRS story, but they haven\u0027t been able to scramble to the floor of the House quickly enough to target left-leaning groups.Comments (34)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistI was as stunned as everyone else by Angelina Jolie\u0027s revelation on Tuesday that she\u0027d had a double mastectomy to reduce her risk of developing breast cancer. That\u0027s not only because one of the most famous women in the world had managed to keep such a dramatic secret under wraps for so long (although that is pretty amazing).Comments (95)Kate FlanneryActress, The OfficeEveryone keeps asking what I am going to do now that The Office is ending. I liberated myself on live radio by simply saying, \"I\u0027m gonna kill myself.\"Comments (28)Michael ZakarasWriter and strategist who specializes in social entrepreneurship and public policyIn our efforts to solve difficult social problems in particular, we rely too heavily on reason and numbers and econometrics, and not often enough on empathy. And by empathy I don\u0027t just mean our emotions, and I certainly don\u0027t mean feeling sorry -- that\u0027s sympathy.CommentsBeth WoolseyWriter, humorist at the Five Kids Is A Lot of Kids blogIf you pay attention, kids will teach you how to laugh loudly, how to love deeply and how to live fully. They will also ruin all your stuff.CommentsDean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Wall Street excesses brought the economy to the brink of collapse. But now the Wall Street behemoths are bigger than ever and President Obama is looking to cut the Social Security benefits of retirees. That will teach the Wall Street boys to be more responsible in the future.Comments (400)John PavleyCTO @ The Huffington Post, BloggerGoogle I/O is to software developers as Burning Man is to free spirits. Like its twin sister, Apple\u0027s World Wide Developer Conference (WWDC), it is four days of pep rally, serious questions and answers, press releases, demos, knowledge transfer, and catching up with old and new friends.CommentsRicky GervaisActor, writer, comedian, director, producerI am so proud of The Ricky Gervais Show. Not just because of how well it turned out or how successful it was, or the awards, or even how much fun I had producing it.Comments (20)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Six months into a second term and the Obama White House is on the defensive and floundering: Benghazi, the IRS\u0027s investigations of right-wing groups, the Justice Department\u0027s snooping into journalists\u0027 phone records, Obamacare behind schedule, the Administration\u0027s push for gun control ending in failure.Comments (86)Sec. Kathleen SebeliusSecretary of Health and Human ServicesToday, for nearly the 40th time since it\u0027s been the law of the land, House Republicans staged yet another repeal vote in their latest attempt to turn back the clock on progress and deny Americans health insurance coverage they can count on.CommentsRichard (RJ) EskowWriter; host, \u0027The Breakdown\u0027; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureSimpson and Bowles and austerity\u0027s other sales people aren\u0027t really economic thinkers. They\u0027re paid to pitch a product. They didn\u0027t invent austerity any more than Alex Rodriguez invented Pepsi. But what they\u0027re peddling isn\u0027t a soft drink. It\u0027s a lot worse for you than that.Comments (30)Tom Zeller Jr.Senior Writer, The Huffington PostWhat\u0027s not a matter of debate is that human beings are saturating the atmosphere with volumes of carbon dioxide -- mostly arising from the burning of fossil fuels -- at an unprecedented rate.Comments (5,821)Salma Hayek PinaultActress, Co-founder of Chime for ChangeIn the information age, there are no innocent bystanders. We all share in everything that happens. But that means we also have the chance, the ability, and the responsibility, to right what is wrong. We can be defined not just by what we know, but by what we do.Comments (17)Andy KrollStaff writer, Mother Jones magazineSimply tallying Adelson\u0027s wins and losses -- or the Koch brothers\u0027, or George Soros\u0027s, or any other mega-donors\u0027 -- misses the bigger point.Comments (19)Ken SolinAuthor, \u0027Act Like a Man\u0027A year ago I wrote an article listing the 20 qualities I wanted in my next boomer lover. It garnered more than 1,000 comments, both supportive and critical.Comments (109)Summer Rayne OakesModel-activist; co-founder, Source4Style | summerrayne.netWhat seems to be an impenetrable and immutable industry actually isn\u0027t.

The bump on his eyelid that worsened quickly was more than just a bump, it was something that had the potential to change our lives.CommentsDoug BandowSenior Fellow, the Cato InstituteIran is Exhibit #1 for the threat posed by Islamic fundamentalists gaining control of government. Iranian repression is increasing and the space available to regime opponents is diminishing.Comments (14)Jenni MorelloHalf the Sky Movement crewmemberIn our modern society we forget that maternal mortality is a threat that still plagues the world.CommentsSheryl KraftFreelance WriterAngelina Jolie was not the only one to choose a prophylactic mastectomy. I did, too -- but for different reasons.. (Thank you, Angelina, for making it public. You\u0027ve given me the courage to write about it for the very first time).Comments (45)Mike RyanSenior Entertainment Writer, The Huffington PostI\u0027ve never really understood the divide between Star Wars and Star Trek fans. As far I can tell, they\u0027re just two sides of the same tragic coin.Comments (69)Peter S. GoodmanExecutive Business Editor, The Huffington PostLost in the latest political scandal is a simple fact: The Internal Revenue Service was acting in the public interest when it opted to train its auditing power on the Tea Party and affiliated groups.Comments (5,026)Neil McCarthyPolitical activist and New York attorneyWhat should all these people say?
