{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"You\u0027d think a ten-and-a-half year war would be a major issue in a presidential campaign -- especially a war going as badly as the one in Afghanistan. But our political and media establishments seem to regard being in a constant state of war as simply part of the \"new normal.\" Things continue to go from bad to worse, yet we continue to be wedded to plans for a gradual withdrawal that will leave troops in Afghanistan until some point in 2014. But even though our leaders don\u0027t seem to feel any sense of urgency, plenty of others here at home do. Indeed, the sentiment that the war is going badly is one of the few bipartisan things in this campaign. And while there are many issues on which our leaders are out of sync with the country at large, this one is especially egregious.Read Post | Comments (754)Matthew Dowd, 04/04/12Political strategistAs we move from the primary contest to the general election and are on the verge of the 200-day war between President Obama and Mitt Romney, let\u0027s pause for a minute and reflect on some things we have learned \\and offer a little advice on Romney\u0027s immediate next steps.Read Post | CommentsDoon Baqi, 04/04/12Army Officer, Paratrooper, Actor, Writer, Lawyer-in-trainingBringing in Daniel Craig seemed a subtle departure from the other Bonds.

It also made him look like a fool. He was certainly not acting like a leader but a schoolyard bully who wants his way at any cost.Read Post | Comments (930)William Astore, 04/04/12Writer, Professor, Retired Lt.

And yet -- I still don\u0027t know what it\u0027s like to be a person of color in America. It\u0027s never easy to talk about the ugly side of our society.
