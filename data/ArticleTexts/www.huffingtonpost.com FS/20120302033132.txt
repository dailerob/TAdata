{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Executive Editor, The Huffington PostWe live in the world\u0027s richest country, a cornucopia brimming with spacious, warm homes; supermarkets stuffed with food; educational opportunities; cradles of innovation; a dizzying cascade of techno-gadgets, mobile devices, and flat-panel TVs; tank-sized cars and luxury resorts -- and, of course, piles and piles of money. Yet we are also home to a middle class confronting the erosion of several decades of financial and social gains and a deeply entrenched population of impoverished Americans cursed with diminished opportunities, diminished ways of escape, and diminished expectations. Today, the Huffington Post is launching a year-long exploration and examination of the lives of middle class and poor Americans in a series called \"Breakdown: Americans on the Edge.\"Read Post | Comments (330)Arianna Huffington, 03/01/12I\u0027m delighted to announce the launch of HuffPost Money, a section dedicated to looking at the big financial stories of our time, with an eye on answering the question: how do the day\u0027s headlines affect you and your finances? Check it out here.Read Post | Comments (30)Bill Maher, 03/01/12Host of HBO\u0027s \"Real Time with Bill Maher\"If you grow up in America, it\u0027s pretty rare if you don\u0027t love money. One of the first things I ever remember being punished for was stealing money. Five dollars, off my father\u0027s dresser.Read Post | Comments (733)Steven Weber, 03/01/12Actor, wise-assSay what you will about Andrew, for all the rankling he may have incited for those of us on the left or the enthusiasm he certainly inspired for those of us on the right, he made the whole thing pretty exhilarating. And that\u0027s better than it was.Read Post | Comments (16)Chris Mooney, 03/01/12Author, \u0027The Republican War on Science\u0027 and \u0027The Republican Brain\u0027Rick Santorum is absolutely right that higher education is a liberal and secular force in our society at present. But he\u0027s also highly simplistic in his view that it creates liberals or atheists -- or that it intentionally discriminates against conservatives or the devout.Read Post | Comments (396)Geoffrey Dunn, 03/01/12Author, The Lies of Sarah PalinThe he-said-she-said nature of the Game Change controversy -- all based on off-the-record sources -- creates an opportunity for pushback and denial. The uncontested documents from the 2008 campaign, however, provide no squirm room for Palin and her minions.Read Post | CommentsSheila Bair, 03/01/12Former Chairman, FDIC; Advisor, Pew Charitable TrustsWould you take money that your daughter needs for braces and make a short term loan to a Wall Street firm? Probably not, but if you\u0027ve put your ready cash in a prime money market fund, those are the kinds of places where your money may be sitting now.Read Post | Comments (16)Robert Naiman, 03/01/12Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicyA new poll suggests that the reason that the majority of Israelis do not support an Israeli military strike on Iran without U.S. approval is that they share the cautions of U.S. officials -- they think that the costs would be high, and the benefits small or nonexistent.Read Post | Comments (126)Nathan Newman, 03/01/12Founder, Tech-Progress.orgWe seem to be having two debates about Google -- on the cultural side, the question is whether the company violates user privacy too much and, on the business side, is Google a monopoly threat in the marketplace? But these are not separate issues at all.Read Post | CommentsDiane Ehrensaft, Ph.D., 03/01/12Developmental and clinical psychologist; mental health director, Child and Adolescent Gender CenterAs we see the media\u0027s growing interest in transgender and gender-nonconforming children and their families, I can\u0027t underscore enough the responsibility of journalists who cover them and the issues related to these children and young people to get the terminology right.Read Post | CommentsMairlyn Smith, 03/01/12Home economist and food writerThe old adage \"When in doubt, throw it out\" rings true in your fridge. My dad always does the sniff test, but the problem is you can\u0027t smell bacteria when it first starts growing. When something starts to smell it\u0027s usually so far gone that it becomes a no- brainer to pitch it out.Read Post | CommentsAmy Tara Koch, 03/01/12Style expert, author, journalist, and all-around fashion aficionadoA groovy, eclectic blend of sporty modern and vintage is what catapulted Kate Moss into the realm of fashion icon. First stop? Mom\u0027s closet.Read Post | CommentsAlaa Al Aswany, 03/01/12Best-selling Egyptian author and columnistBefore we start supporting the consensus candidate, we must establish that he is completely loyal to us and that we will be able to maintain full control of him now and in the future. This candidate, whom we will make president of Egypt, must carry out everything we ask of him.Read Post | CommentsRichard Cordray, 03/01/12Director, Consumer Financial Protection BureauWe have heard story after story of consumers being hit with fees they did not expect and do not understand. We take these complaints very seriously.Read Post | Comments (12)Conrad Black, 02/28/12Historian, publisher, and authorThe memoir of Mimi Alford of her affair as a White House intern with President John F. Kennedy reopens an intriguing question: Should the public be concerned with a president\u0027s sex-life?Read Post | CommentsSen. Kirsten Gillibrand, 03/01/12U.S. Senator from New YorkLet me say this once and for all: the power to decide whether to use contraception or any other preventive care service should be up to each individual woman, not her boss.Read Post | Comments (105)David Shapiro, 03/01/12Staff Attorney, ACLU National Prison ProjectMany states have finally taken serious steps to reduce mass imprisonment, but new long-term contracts for full prisons would hamper those efforts. That would be bad news for the nation, but good news for Corrections Corporation of America.Read Post | CommentsEliot Daley, 03/01/12Writer; formerly an executive, consultant, and pastor/chaplainWhy should your employer have any say whatsoever about how you manage your reproductive health? Why? Can you think of one good reason? Your employer, of all people, influencing the most intimate decisions in your life -- could anything be more ridiculous?Read Post | Comments (126)Marcus Samuelsson, 03/01/12Chef and authorLearning to tweak and enhance just a few ingredients and flavor combinations can help you transform those ordinary ingredients into the extraordinary!Read Post | CommentsPamela Gross, 03/01/12BloggerDon\u0027t post pictures of yourself with a dolphin.

What might we come to better understand about ourselves? What might we accomplish together?Read Post | Comments (18)Robert L. Wolke, 03/01/12Scientist, journalist, satirist, and authorThe Fukushima earthquake speeded up the planet\u0027s rotation by 1.8 microseconds per revolution, so our day is now 1.8 microseconds shorter than it was last year. Now go explain to your boss why you weren\u0027t able to get that report finished on time.Read Post | CommentsAlton Lu, 03/01/1218-year-old senior in high schoolIn the recent Arizona Republican debate, the candidates, aside from Ron Paul, were seen advocating for stronger sanctions and military action against Iran.Read Post | CommentsJustin Shubow, 03/01/12President and chairman, National Civic Art SocietyIs it \"nostalgia\" to ask that the Eisenhower Memorial \"shall blend with the essential lines of the old\"? Would critics like to see Paris \"improved\" by some more oppressive skyscraper?
