{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Business Editor, The Huffington PostStep back from the ledge, America. Scotch the gloomy talk of a Japan-style Lost Decade -- Goldman Sachs says we\u0027re alright. Except that Goldman\u0027s dismissal of Lost Decade fears is brazenly self-serving. We are very much lost, and have been for decades.

He assumes that asking why people were driven to these protests is somehow in competition with asking how they achieved such effective protests.Read Post | CommentsLincoln Mitchell, 02.02.2011Harriman Institute, Columbia UniversityDeemphasizing democracy rhetoric was a reasonable strategy for the Obama administration as it allowed them to differentiate their administration from Bush\u0027s. The problem is, it also gave the appearance that the U.S. was casting its lot with the authoritarians.Read Post | CommentsJason Linkins, 02.02.2011Political Reporter, Huffington PostOn January 21, Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank boldly declared he was going to take a \"Palin-free month\" in February.

There are several reasons for the current uprising which must be borne in mind in order to figure out where to go from here.Read Post | CommentsKristen Breitweiser, 02.02.20119/11 widow and activistNearly 8 long years ago, the Iraq War was wrongfully started under the guise of spreading democracy in the Middle East. And now, I sit and watch real democracy take to the streets in Egypt brought on by average citizens.Read Post | CommentsDan Rather, 02.01.2011Host, Dan Rather ReportsEveryone loves the story of a comeback, and in the world of politics, underdog stories don\u0027t get much better or unlikelier than that of Senator Lisa Murkowski.Read Post | CommentsBill McKibben, 02.02.2011Author of a dozen books, including The End of Nature and Deep EconomyWelcome to our planet, circa 2011, a planet that, like some unruly adolescent, has decided to test the boundaries.

The Nobel Peace Prize winner in the middle of the crowd. With the megaphone.Read Post | CommentsLarry Magid, 02.02.2011Technology journalistDespite its fabulous appearance, I found The Daily to be disappointing mainly because the news was already out of date. If you\u0027re going to create an electronic news source it had better be up-to-the-minute.Read Post | CommentsKenneth Roth, 02.02.2011Executive director of Human Rights WatchSo what\u0027s next? After finally deciding to give human rights concerns pride of place in January\u0027s US-China summit, how should the Obama administration translate its rhetoric into policy?Read Post | CommentsRobert Reich, 02.02.2011Fmr. Secretary of Labor; Professor at Berkeley; Author, Aftershock: \u0027The Next Economy and America\u0027s Future\u0027While Wall Street\u0027s bull market is making America\u0027s rich even richer, most Americans continue to be mired in a worsening housing crisis that the administration is incapable of stemming, and of which Wall Street has now seemingly washed its hands.Read Post | CommentsRabbi Shmuley Boteach, 02.02.2011Rabbi and writerThe German and Jewish people are forever locked in what Martin Luther King, Jr. called a \u0027single garment of destiny.\u0027Read Post | CommentsDavid Sirota, 02.02.2011Newspaper columnist, radio host (AM760), bestselling authorMoney buys the language that confine our political debate within narrow parameters. It frames the Egyptian situation as a choice between \"pragmatism\" (backing the dictator) and potential terrorism (allowing Egyptians to elect their own government).Read Post | CommentsAndy Stern, 02.02.2011Georgetown Public Policy Institute and Former President, SEIUOur Sputnik moment lacks the energy and political cohesion for lift off while China keeps rolling along because the political class in Washington thinks we can drive into the future looking in the rearview mirror.Read Post | CommentsAmb. Marc Ginsberg, 02.01.2011Former US Ambassador to MoroccoAs the Brotherhood thrusts itself into a central role in any post-Mubarak transitional coalition, the Brotherhood\u0027s rabid ideological brand of Islam is raising the specter of an Egypt potentially slipping into the hands of Islamic extremists.Read Post | CommentsKate Seelye, 02.02.2011Vice President, Middle East InstituteIn the context of unfolding events in Egypt and throughout the region, Woodrow Wilson offers an important lesson for President Obama and his administration.Read Post | CommentsSusan Abulhawa, 02.02.2011Author, Mornings in JeninMubarak\u0027s latest cynical tactic is to send in armed gangs, mostly from his notorious police force, to ignite riots, thus making his hold on power all the more necessary for the sake of restoring security and order.Read Post | CommentsSophia Yin, 02.02.2011Veterinarian, applied animal behavioristLast week the media headlines warned us that we shouldn\u0027t sleep with our pets, because doing so could make us sick.

Cavnar, 02.02.2011Founder, DailyHurricane.comIf BP gets away with reducing the flow estimate to half of the current estimate in the Gulf spill, it will be a masterful manipulation of government regulators and inexperienced administration officials.Read Post | CommentsAmir Madani, 02.02.2011Author, Le Letture PersianeEgyptians have no Martin Luther King or Islamic Gandhi and they are caught between jihadi confessional movements and regimes supported by security structures.
