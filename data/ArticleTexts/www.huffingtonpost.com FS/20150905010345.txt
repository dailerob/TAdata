{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersOpponents of the agreement had hoped to use the August break to sway undecided members of Congress. They pledged to spend millions of dollars on TV ads. They threatened to fill town hall meetings with angry, sign-waving constituents. Their intent was to build a veto-proof majority in the House and Senate to scuttle this plan, which is one of the Obama administration\u0027s signature foreign policy achievements -- reason enough for opposition for many Republican lawmakers. It didn\u0027t happen, and now it\u0027s time to be peacemakers.The labor force remained flat in August, meaning the participation rate is still stuck at a low 62.6%, more than three points off of its peak prior to the downturn. Some of that decline can be assigned to retiring boomers, but some remains due to persistently weak demand.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThe first time I met a refugee was the day I was born. She was my mother. My parents were fleeing the Iranian regime.

Was I reaching my full potential?U.S. Senator from New YorkThis isn\u0027t just about garbage; it\u0027s about everything. For many years, people complained about the country.

Co-Founder and Writer for Beirut Syndrome.We can afford to pay workers fairly and it is the right thing to do. We also need equal pay for equal work.

This is unacceptable.U.S. Representative for Illinois\u0027s 9th congressional districtTurkey\u0027s offering Washington a fig leaf of cooperation against the Islamic State, but it\u0027s turning all its firepower against the most effective anti-ISIS fighters in the region -- the Kurds.Foreign Policy In Focus (FPIF) columnistObviously, Judge Richard Berman is not a die-hard New York football fan or if he is, he was able to put that bias aside.

Visit MissRoss.com and TransTechSocial.orgKim Davis has already become a symbol for what is euphemistically called \"Freedom of Religion,\" which unfortunately in recent times has just become code for anti-LGBT bigotry.

At work, as I ran errands, and as I fell asleep at night, this one absolutely crucial question bounced endlessly around inside my head: Do I put my yoga mat at the front of the class, or at the back of the class?Author, Talk Show Host, Sexpert, Metaphysician, Motivational Speaker, Holistic Practitioner, Ordained ReverendDavis and her supporters, whether out of ignorance or willfulness, have completely distorted the Constitution. The Constitution is the supreme law of the land, and, in our system of government, the Supreme Court has the final say as to what the Constitution means.Vice President, Constitutional Accountability Center (CAC).The heart-breaking dilemma of the migrants and refugees flooding into Europe is shocking, sad and should concern us all. While it would be foolish to offer any simple solution, I do think that there are some attitudes that we should have.Christian Author and SpeakerIt is time to take Donald Trump very seriously indeed.

He is also a dangerous one, in a series of linked and disturbing ways.Worrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsWould that President Obama meant what he said when, as he began his symbolic, climate-change-awareness trek to Alaska, he declared: \"The time to plead ignorance is surely past.\"Syndicated writer\"What Do You Mean,\" like \"Blurred Lines,\" points to a consensual ambiguity where a woman\u0027s partner takes interpretation into his own hands by presuming (incorrectly) to know what she\u0027s thinking -- even when she says otherwise.Writer, dancer, and foodieDon\u0027t get my wrong, I did a lot of stuff right on my weight loss journey. But in hindsight, there are a handful of things I would have changed to make my weight loss experience more pleasurable and less rigid.Weight loss expert, nutritionist, health coach, author, and former plus-sizer.Each year, we set aside one day, Labor Day, to honor American workers, who put in extremely long hours and are incredibly productive.

But to see Jobs as only that not only misunderstands the man, but the world we live in today.Gentleman farmer, film critic for ReThink ReviewsSpurred on by the increasingly dire human and political costs of inadequate response, European leaders will gather in mid-September to address the refugee crisis. They should look to the environmental conservation movement to find innovative policy ideas.Building a Resilient DemocracyThe most recent Planned Parenthood fetal tissue videos, I must admit, were initially jarring.
