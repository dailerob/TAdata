Senator Ted Cruz, who is quickly making a name for himself as a modern-day Joe McCarthy, turned a normal committee vote into his own personal circus, making outlandish smear after outlandish smear against Chuck Hagel that earned the ire not just of senators in the room, but Capitol Hill newspapers, national media, and even his home state newspaper. Thing of it is, Cruz knows very well who his base is: The increasingly shrill far right, which want to see vicious opposition to anything President Obama says, does, or proposes. People have joked, with some degree of truth, that if President Obama came out against drinking Drano, Tea Party Congressmen and senators would immediately go out and chug gallons of it.Read Post | Comments (94)Howard Fineman, 02/13/13Editorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupPresident Barack Obama laid out a detailed progressive agenda, a recitation that some pundits panned, but that early polls showed the public liked.Read Post | Comments (221)Jean Ragalie, 02.12.2013Jean Ragalie, RD, President, National Dairy CouncilIt\u0027s the time of year again when people look for a quick fix and often turn to a fad diet that typically eliminates an entire food group in exchange for the promise of changing a person\u0027s appearance in a short period of time.
