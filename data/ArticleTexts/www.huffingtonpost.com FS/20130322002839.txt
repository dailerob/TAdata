{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jason LinkinsEditor, Eat the PressIf you\u0027re the sort of person who spends their evenings poring over research and financial filings pertaining to lobbying activities, you may have noticed that in recent years, \"both spending on lobbying and the number of active lobbyists has declined.\" Good news, right? Influence peddling is on the wane! Hooray for good government! Alas, this is not the case. A recent report from the Center for Responsive Politics (CRP), which -- while noting that \"the lackluster economy\" and \"a gridlocked Congress\" play a role in the decline -- makes the case that these seeming declines are actually attributable to rule changes that essentially allow lobbyists to hide in plain sight as \"not-lobbyists.\"Comments (28)Bob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowHere we are, ten years later, Democrats -- commemorating an unnecessary war in Iraq by continuing to allow gun zealots to purchase unnecessary weapons of war. Obviously, Democrats are more willing to vote for a misguided war than to prevent the proliferation of weapons of war.Comments (387)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkThere\u0027s a reason why Blacks, Latinos, Asians, gays, immigrants and other groups overwhelmingly voted with the Democrats during the last election -- mainly that we vote with those who fight for greater equality.Comments (488)Dr. Josef OlmertAdjunct Professor, University of South CarolinaFor three days this week Israel is a state under siege. Jerusalem is almost paralyzed due to President Obama\u0027s visit, Tel-Aviv is still moving , but nearly choking with excitement, as the second best soccer player in the world, Christiano Ronaldo, arrived with the Portuguese national team to play lowly Israel.Comments (14)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027We are the richest nation in the history of the world -- richer now than we\u0027ve ever been. But an increasing share of that wealth is held by a smaller and smaller share of the population, who have, in effect, bribed legislators to reduce their taxes and provide loopholes so they pay even less.Comments (390)Allison TateAuthor, mother of fourOne day, I was (over) preparing to have a baby, and now I have a 10-year-old. I can\u0027t really tell you how the biggest chunk of his childhood has already happened and is already in the books, but it is. It\u0027s done. I hope it was good.CommentsNorman LearFounder, People for the American WayWe veterans of WWII and everyone who remembers Eisenhower, this gentle man with the giant fist, the president who kept us out of conflict after conflict, often against the advice of those around him, have an investment in how he is remembered.Comments (109)Margaret ChoComedian, actor and recording artistHatred and homophobia can never be underestimated. And the effect of someone saying \"God hates fags\" can never be underestimated either. It\u0027s a license to kill. It\u0027s a death sentence. It\u0027s not funny. It\u0027s not OK. It\u0027s not something I can let go easily, because I know what it truly means.Comments (199)Rabbi Marc Schneier and Russell SimmonsIn our modern era, the open question remains: How will we, as an ever-more diverse and often fractious nation, avoid the fate of the ancient Egyptians, and instead succeed in responding to the challenge of the ninth plague?CommentsMichelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesWhy did Pope Francis, as Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, rail against gays in such a bigoted way after he was unsuccessful in getting support for civil unions in Argentina? Because one doesn\u0027t become pope by doing otherwise.Comments (43)Michael Hogan and Christopher RosenWill Harmony Korine\u0027s hallucinogenic meditation on gluttony, excess and the gleeful self-objectification of today\u0027s active co-eds actually connect with mainstream audiences, or are we witnessing a frenzy of excitement among a very small subset of viewers?Comments (32)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarAs we look at the rise of females in charge, there\u0027s been speculation of a future of kinder, gentler work environments. Maybe that will happen, maybe it won\u0027t. But guaranteed, the onus isn\u0027t on the queen bee alone. It\u0027s on her worker bees as well.Comments (468)MJ RosenbergWashington Spectator, Special Correspondent For Middle East AffairsObama accomplished what he had to. He reached over Netanyahu\u0027s head and spoke directly to the Israeli people, explaining why peace is in their own best interest and why justice for the Palestinians cannot be denied. And he was cheered.Comments (14)Sen. Mazie HironoU.S. Senator for HawaiiEarlier this week, I chaired a Senate hearing on an issue that\u0027s gotten a lot of attention recently, but has been a defining and personal subject for me my whole life: immigration -- specifically, its effect on families.Comments (54)Lincoln MitchellHarriman Institute, Columbia UniversityDid he not realize that the sons and daughters of many of his constituents, who are indeed also loved by their parents no less than Portman loves his own son, had been treated unfairly due to the laws that he had supported?Comments (92)Derek PenwellAuthor; Editor; Speaker; ActivistChurches with massive overhead invested in things like church buildings, denominational infrastructures, functional church organizational models are awakening to the fact that the generations that are supposed to be taking the institutional baton are showing very little interest.Comments (160)Linda BergtholdHealth policy researcherWhat is actually going on with health reform? Is it really going to happen? Yes it is. But it will mean different things for different people. Here\u0027s what it might mean for some of you.CommentsMohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOAs they scramble to sort out the mess in Cyprus, European officials would be well advised to constantly remind themselves of a reality that I suspect extends across the continent: Despite all the happy talk about smaller deficits and lower sovereign credit spreads, citizens have yet to feel any notable improvement in their actual standard of living and in their prospects.Comments (191)Steve-OAuthor, \"Professional Idiot\"; stunt performerThere\u0027s a lot of violence in the world, but here\u0027s an area where all of us can make a positive difference, first in our own lives, and then in the lives of others. Together, we can spread compassion far and wide.Comments (18)Cherie Blair and Siddharth ChatterjeeWomen are half India\u0027s demographic dividend; if they are given the right tools and community support, they can not only become financially independent, but could also become the engines that fuel India\u0027s future growth.CommentsGrover NorquistPresident, Americans for Tax ReformThis latest assault on Internet commerce is wrong for many reasons. It will undermine healthy tax competition -- pressure to keep taxes low in your state. It creates real privacy concerns. And it is only the first step in allowing politicians in another state to tax you in yours.Comments (22)Jay Gordon, MDNationally renowned pediatrician and Assistant Professor of Pediatrics, UCLA Medical SchoolToday the CDC announced a 72 percent increase in the diagnosis of autism over the past four years. One of every 50 children aged 6 years to 17 years has an autism spectrum diagnosis.Comments (34)Eleanore S. WellsSingles expert. Author, The Spinsterlicious Life http://EleanoreWells.comLife in a society where most people are single would require a few changes in the way we do things. Here\u0027s a few I thought of...Comments (366)Larry WomackFounder, 1450 Media; former Associate News Editor, The Huffington PostThis all comes down to the fact that Limbaugh seems to think that women are worth so little that even Beyoncé needs a man to provide for her.Comments (34)Peter TurnleyPeterturnley.comCommentsJames ClearEntrepreneur, weightlifter, and travel photographerThe patterns that you repeat on a daily basis will eventually form the identity that you believe in and the actions that you take. You can transform your identity and become the type of person who doesn\u0027t need motivation to perform well.CommentsLynda LopezEmmy Award-winning journalistIf you are ever down, or lose faith and feel that we are living in terrible times and are in a terrible place, you only need a few minutes talking to these girls to feel ready to take on the world again.CommentsRonnie MusgroveFormer governor of MississippiThe issue of equal rights for LGBT individuals has vexed politicians for decades. I have my own cloudy history with the issue, which I believed at the time was a principled position based on my faith. But I no longer believe it was right.Comments (81)Tom WeisPresident, Climate Crisis SolutionsWhy aren\u0027t all Keystone XL opponents loudly demanding that President Obama stop construction of the pipeline\u0027s 485-mile southern leg that is destroying the lives of our fellow Americans in Texas and Oklahoma?Comments (19)Ann JonesJournalist, photographer, authorWhen tyranny and violence are practiced on a grand scale in foreign lands, the practice also intensifies at home. As American militarism went into overdrive after 9/11, it validated violence against women here.Comments (62)Ronna BenjaminManaging Editor/Boston www.betterafter50.comI brought back an extra four pounds from my trip to Florence visiting my daughter who is doing a semester there, as well as some fantastic truffle oil. But it turns out there was a legitimate reason for my complete lack of discipline. It was the jet lag.Comments (13)Pierre R. Berastaín, 2013.21.03Roy Speckhardt, 2013.21.03Rev.
