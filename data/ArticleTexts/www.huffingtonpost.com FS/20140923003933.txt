It wasn\u0027t because they became besotted watching re-runs of Braveheart or Rob Roy, or even because they coveted more of a share of North Sea oil revenues.

Should a man have to sacrifice his economic security to take care of his sick mother or his wife returning wounded from active duty?U.S. Secretary of LaborThe bottom line is clear: Climate change is a reality, and it is having a real impact. While the need for a response is urgent in communities across the country, our leaders in Washington have failed to find a way past partisan gridlock and get something done.Attorney General for New York StateAs we mark the end of another year with the advent of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, we pause to take stock of the year that has passed, to learn from ourselves, our experiences and our mistakes as we move forward to build a better future.National Director, Anti-Defamation LeagueThe academic crisis is even more dire than Iraq in war-torn Syria, where universities have been occupied or destroyed and thousands of students and professors have been displaced, threatened, or killed.President and Chief Executive Officer, Institute of International EducationPresident of the Portuguese Republic (1996-2006)Obama is backing away from a policy he says he will enact anyway, and he\u0027s telling voters openly that he\u0027s timing it for political reasons. If he\u0027s behind the policy, he should enact it and let the voters decide.Editor, Latino VoicesWhat Boeing is doing represents a seismic shift in health care financing and delivery that potentially will have more far-reaching effects than Obamacare, primarily because it is coming from the private sector, not the government.Author, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgThe payoff of enjoying a meal in the company of a dozen or two friends is always worth it.food52.comFrom Rio to Paris to Istanbul to Durban to Seoul, city mayors are already making great progress in reducing greenhouse-gas emissions and minimizing climate risks.Mayor of ParisPremière Adjointe au Maire de ParisMayor of Seoul, South KoreaEarly Friday morning, in the quiet of his home office, Brian Curin will power up his laptop, click open a special folder and launch a file called \"My Life.\" Then he will watch the images and hear the words that his wife and three daughters thankfully have never seen or heard.CEO, American Heart AssociationTonight on PBS, I\u0027m joined by New York Times columnist and best-selling author, Nicholas Kristof.PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorhusband, father, photographer, writer, producer and director kenhammphoto.comAs girls are critical to successful education outcomes -- we especially need to ensure we collect gender-sensitive, disaggregated data.
