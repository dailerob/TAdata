{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"As President Obama said, Friday\u0027s deadly assaults weren\u0027t just an attack on Paris and the people of France, but \"an attack on all of humanity and the universal values that we share.\" And as barbaric as the attacks were, the values of unity and solidarity began to assert themselves almost immediately. With the city still in chaos, the hashtag #PorteOuverte (or #OpenDoor) appeared on Twitter from Parisians promising safe haven to any who needed to get off the streets. There were many other small moments of compassion and cohesion -- people fighting back by standing together, choosing connection over isolation -- where the people of Paris reminded us that our greatest strength in maintaining a free and open society is to recognize our common humanity. Be sure to check out HuffPost\u0027s (and for those of you who speak French, Le Huffington Post\u0027s) on-going coverage of the attacks and their aftermath, including Anne Sinclair\u0027s powerful post.Two days in. Time itself cried yesterday. For the first time in days, the sky had darkened and a chill blew through the air. The day unfolded with the nightmare of the night before and the dullness of being awake in its midst.Editorial Director, Le Huffington PostIn this minute of silence, we will live, standing up to show that together, we will remain standing in the face of infamy, cowardice and barbarism.School PrincipalOne morning as I scanned the news--horror in the Middle East, Russia and America facing off in the Ukraine, I thought of Edward Snowden and wondered how he was holding up in Moscow. I began to imagine a conversation with him and a few others.Makes films; Board member, Freedom of the Press FoundationAuthor, \u0027The God of Small Things\u0027 and \u0027Capitalism: A Ghost Story\u0027Once again, the ideals of freedom and peace are under attack on the very streets that helped give birth to the idea that you can’t have one without the other in modern life. Once again, President Barack Obama went to a podium in Washington to declare American solidarity with France -- and to vow that an attack on French society was an attack on the very ideas of decency, modernity and sanity.Global Editorial DirectorAmid the horror, the blood, the anxiety that have now gripped Paris, one single decision lacerates the soul as a fragile, pathetic, emotional confession of impotence: the French frontiers have been closed.L\u0027Huffington Post Editorial DirectorWe can ask for the world to think Beirut is as important as Paris, or for Facebook to add a \"safety check\" button for us to use daily, or for people to care about us. But the truth of the matter is, we are a people that doesn\u0027t care about itself to begin. We call it the new normal, but if this normality then let it go to hell.Physician and bloggerOn Saturday morning, after the Paris attacks, I started contacting friends. If, through some hideously random twist of fate one of my friends is injured (or worse) as this bizarre, unpredictable and violent phase of history plays out, then I want to at least know I made the most of things with my mates. I don\u0027t want to be saying: \"I should have been a better friend.\"Editor-in-chief of The Huffington Post UKIt\u0027s well past 2 a.m. now and our eyes are glued to the news. We\u0027ve closed the curtains and I shake every time we hear a car go by, thinking about the Mumbai hotel attacks in 2008 that killed more than 160 and wounded hundreds.Director of Growth \u0026 Analytics, The Huffington PostAs France mourns, and as Americans are drawn more and more into the struggle against ISIS, the Obama Administration and its European allies have to turn the tables on Arab states before ISIS strikes again against us.Fmr. U.S. Ambassador to Morocco; White House Middle East AdviserI don\u0027t yet know the names of any of those who died. I don\u0027t know their stories or what they did. But I know their dinner reservations, their ticket confirmations for the band they liked, the ache in their bones after a long week at work. They were friends I hadn\u0027t met yet.Editorial Assistant, HuffPost UK BlogsWe felt the floor and wall vibrate in the room where we were meeting. The management team preferred to reassure us, explaining that it was a firework. But we felt that something serious had happened.Journalism studentAs hard as President Obama and his Administration have worked to expand opportunity and make this a more equal country, these accomplishments would not have been possible without the advocates, allies, activists and ordinary people doing extraordinary things, to change our culture every single day.Senior Advisor to the President and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsWhat this series of events does show is the chasm that sadly still exists in the experiences and therefore perspectives of most white people compared to most people of color.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersTo support additional public services for refugees, countries neighboring conflict zones will require more financial resources. The international community must play its part. With the IMF\u0027s support, for example, Jordan has been able to adjust its fiscal targets to help meet this need. Ultimately, however, one thing is very clear: No country can manage the refugee issue on their own. We need global cooperation.Managing Director, IMFA society faced with terrorism fails at the moment it behaves exactly as the ideologies of terror predict it will. Do not grant them the satisfaction.Former president of SOS RacismeIn the effort to stop gun violence, there is a way around the Congress, if President Obama is willing to seize the opportunity and use the purchasing power of the federal government -- as well as states and municipalities -- to make the gun industry assume corporate responsibility for its lethal products and change its ways.Former U.S. CongresswomanExecutive Director, New Yorkers Against Gun ViolenceUniversities have a deep obligation to protect and preserve the freedom of expression. That is, most fundamentally, at the very core of what makes a university a university. This has not always been true.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoAs I awoke this morning, thinking about the gruesome attacks in Paris last night I reflected on the cataclysmic mistakes we made after September 11.Director of Human Rights programs for Global ExchangeAmerica is about opportunity. Who should be denied a chance? What\u0027s happening on these campuses is obscene, and if the two front runners of the Republican party don\u0027t have the courage to stand up to it, they should not be running for office.Actress and authorIt\u0027s 2015 and much of the media seem to accept, still, that LGBT people can be talked about this way at an event attended by presidential candidates and that it\u0027s not news.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostIf you\u0027ve ever opened a credit card, rented a car or engaged in any number of other routine interactions with big corporations, you\u0027ve probably had to sign away your right to go to court or band together in a class action with other customers.U.S. Senator from MinnesotaU.S. Representative for Georgia\u0027s 4th DistrictThe Boys \u0026 Girls Club has a longstanding partnership with Coca-Cola. This was a great way for the company to establish brand loyalty at an early age, in an era when no one could have imagined what a scourge soda would become.Author, Producer, AdvocateMy dad took off most of his vacation time for the year to act in Master of None. So I\u0027m really relieved this all worked out. On Tuesday night, after we did Colbert together he said: \"This is all fun and I liked acting in the show, but I really just did it so I could spend more time with you.\"Writer, Director, Actor, Stand-Up ComedianWhen my exec at Sony gave me a copy of Lynn Povich\u0027s The Good Girls Revolt last year, I knew we had to make it into a series, both to honor the generation that allowed mine to thrive and for the ones after me who know even less about past media heroines than I did.Feature Film ProducerThe proponents of the Trans-Pacific Partnership are hoping that the rest of us will be happy that we got seats at the children\u0027s table. We will be hearing much about this table as they push to have the deal approved. But it\u0027s long past time that the rest of us be treated like adults.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Mothers who experience depression and other forms of mental illness can\u0027t help what\u0027s happening to them, and surely they\u0027re suffering. The mentally ill often aren\u0027t capable of seeing the impact of their illness on others, so all-consuming it often is.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarWhile DNA might not confirm the legend you\u0027ve heard since you learned to walk, it might bring you a little closer to understanding who your ancestors actually were. Our ancestors were real people, with real successes and real failures.Alphonse Fletcher University Professor and Director of the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research at Harvard UniversityComputational Biologist for AncestryDNADissension and hate are the portals we offer to terrorism. We must close these doors and turn our focus to the mercenaries of self-interest who profit from our defeatist behaviors.Psychiatrist, interfaith harmony proponent.The distinction between Sanders and Clinton as being between \"socialism\" and \"capitalism\" is misleading, for the real debate is about what type of capitalism the candidates favor.Professor of sociology, University of California at BerkeleyAnyone who is pregnant -- celebrity or otherwise -- is doing something very publicly, whether she likes it or not. And singling out any of us, including Kim Kardashian, for a by-the-numbers weight gain commentary is shameful at best.Executive Editor, Huffington Post VoicesGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
