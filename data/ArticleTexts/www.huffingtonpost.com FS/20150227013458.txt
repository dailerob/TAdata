{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President and CEO, Free PressThis is what democracy looks like. That\u0027s not something I thought I\u0027d ever say about the bureaucrats at the Federal Communications Commission. After years of cronyism, corruption and cowardice, Thursday\u0027s vote for strong Net Neutrality rules at the FCC is unexpected if not unprecedented. The FCC is reversing a decade of failed policies, rejecting a massive misinformation campaign from the cable and phone industries, and restoring the agency\u0027s authority to protect Internet users. This is the biggest win for the public interest in the agency\u0027s history. Yet even five months ago, this kind of victory looked impossible.No, climate change is not experiencing a hiatus.

That is why I feel particularly anguished that the ill-advised invitation from House Speaker Boehner has managed to threaten, in my view, both the security of Israel and the historic bipartisan support in the Congress.U.S. Representative for Illinois\u0027s 9th congressional districtFrom October 15, 2014 to January 11, 2015, I ran a rather peculiar experiment... traveling from Paris to New York, and spending 90 days there without Internet, computer or a cell phone. Why? I needed to disconnect in order to better reconnect in a hyper-connected environment.Blogger, Footprint New YorkAs we witness yet again the brutal and bloody consequences of religious intolerance in the form of ISIS, we have a majority of Republicans pining for a Christian America. Proponents of converting the United States into a theocracy do not see the terrible parallel between religious excess in the Middle East and here at home.Scientist and former White House Senior Policy Analyst; Ph.D. in marine biology/neurophysiologyBathe your child in paraben-free, SLS-free, soap-free liquid cleanser-like substance.

McConnell devoted much of this session to supporting the Keystone XL pipeline for dirty tar sands oil and trying to block the EPA from reducing climate change emissions.Director, NRDC Action FundWith almost a year before Valentine\u0027s Day hits again, the Obama administration has time to take an unsparing look at the ever-growing crowd of American allies and ally-wannabes. It\u0027s time for Washington to send the equivalent of a \"Dear John\" letter to a half dozen foreign capitals.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteThere seems to be a pervasive attitude in my Gen X group that technology is destroying our youth. We worry they\u0027ll be unable to succeed at face-to-face communication and connection. But I\u0027m also noticing an equally disturbing trend among midlifers.Dating Guru, Mom Butler, Wife Dominatrix, Slightly MustachioedAt night, you can\u0027t sleep. In the morning, you can\u0027t wake up. Sound familiar? Get back on track with these three myths and facts about sleep.Host of the award-winning Savvy Psychologist podcast and real-life clinical psychologistSeveral members of various state legislators have trotted out the idea that what is missing from college campuses, particularly the hands of 18-year-old women, are six shooters, or even better, semi-automatic handguns.President of One in Four, Professor at Oklahoma State UniversityRecently I found myself in a situation that many transgender people dread: I was in an accident and required emergency medical care.Business nerd, transgender advocate, LGBT workplace equality championIt\u0027s no secret I consider income inequality the greatest challenge of our time. And whether you\u0027re my age or my teenage son Dante\u0027s, it\u0027s clear: the Internet has become fundamental to solving it.109th Mayor of New York CityAlthough he has made such impetuous appeals before, he now makes a new brazen claim that as Prime Minister of Israel, he represents and can speak on behalf of world Jewry. This delusionary claim is an insult to European governments and the nearly 1.5 million Jews who live, work, and flourish in Europe.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUI know I am supposed to be the teacher, the mother. But the truth is, you have taught me more than I\u0027m sure I have managed to teach you.Blogger at Everything and Nothing from Essex- deannajsmith.comJust like some ultra-right wing Orthodox settlers in Israel can impede progress there, so hateful clerics can shape the culture of Arab communities in Europe. The problem is not lack of jobs or social mobility. It is the hijacking of a religion, and we cannot stop it unless we name it.Congregation Solel Rabbi and WriterHow We Can Save Sports: A Game Plan, by Dr. Ken Reed, is basically a sports manifesto that looks at nine of the most important sports issues we face today and the red thread that weaves through them all: ego and greed, and the win-at-all-costs and profit-at-all-costs policies and mentalities whose vices have spawned throughout the world of sports.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorSince 2009, Holder has exercised the powers of his office not merely to preserve the Justice Department as a static institution, as many of his predecessors have done, but to mobilize it as a force for proactive change.Writer; former chief speechwriter to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder; veteran of Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.Republicans promised things would get better if they were put in charge of Congress.
