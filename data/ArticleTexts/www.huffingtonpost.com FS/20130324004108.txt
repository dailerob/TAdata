{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundOur whole country and our nation’s economy bear the financial burden caused by gun violence. Survivors and family members pay the highest price of all. No one should be forced to pay a lifelong emotional or physical toll because a fit of anger, an episode of depression or other mental illness, or a careless accident ended with a gunshot. No child deserves to have their childhood snatched away in an instant and their life changed forever because of an adult’s decision to carry and use guns, including high-powered assault weapons and high capacity ammunition clips. Listen to the children. The costs of gun violence in America are far too high for them and for all of us.Comments (223)Joshua FoerWinner of the USA Memory Championship; Co-founder, Atlas ObscuraHere\u0027s the thing: Despite being U.S. memory champions, Kolli, Dellis, and I occasionally misplace our car keys, just like everyone else. We don\u0027t actually have great memories.Comments (158)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarWhile girl power, the movement that began in the early 90s, has aimed to empower many young girls to be ambitious, assertive, and self-reliant, that girl power as interpreted on TV and in film is slowly but surely seeping into our streets as something more sinister.Comments (40)Dylan RatiganNew York Times Best-Selling author and formerly the host of MSNBC\u0027s The Dylan Ratigan ShowWe have an untapped resource that has yet to be re-purposed. Our veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan are not only experiencing a criminal rate of unemployment, but they are the men and women who have proven themselves willing to pull together and face the most difficult challenges, under the most dire circumstances.Comments (225)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistAnyone who knows me will tell you that I love when things are organized. When I first moved in with my husband and his teenage boys, I actually color-coded their towels. It worked! And my desk is an organizational work of art -- pens over there, paperwork over here and a typed to-do list just to be sure I get it all done.Comments (46)Kate AulettaSenior Travel Editor, Huffington PostHopefully by the time this gets published I\u0027ll be blissfully unaware of my previous pain, hopped up on an epidural in the hospital.Comments (59)Lorraine Devon WilkeWriter of Sass \u0026 SensibilityBeyond the gladiator-like viewing of pumping participants, what is all this porn doing to the young people coming up in the world and just learning about sex; just grasping what to do with those oft-photographed and widely used body parts?Comments (63)Ben ThomasFounder, The ConnectomeJussi Hovenen sings songs that few people care to hear nowadays. He\u0027s the last rune singer in Finland -- the only living man who can still sing most of his ancestors\u0027 great ballads and epics from memory.CommentsJames ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Iraq today is a dysfunctional state beset by violent civil strife, a direct result of the American decision to enter the country without attention to its history and culture and, therefore, unable to understand the consequences of our intervention.Comments (53)Flynt and Hillary Mann LeverettGoing To Tehran authors; Penn State Professor and American University Senior LecturerThe United States is reaching the end of its ability to threaten ever more severe sanctions against third countries doing business with Iran -- but rarely implement such \"secondary\" sanctions -- without eroding the deterrent effect of the threat.Comments (257)Robert RedfordActor, director and environmental activistRumor has it the U.S. Senate will consider a budget bill provision to approve the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline. Here\u0027s what they need to share with their constituents.Comments (447)Jillian BermanAssociate Business Editor, The Huffington PostDon\u0027t get me wrong, I\u0027m happy everyone is more aware of the plight of working women, but all the advice isn\u0027t helping me overcome the real obstacles to my success in the workplace and frankly, in life.Comments (241)Wray HerbertAuthor, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027The more vivid and concrete an image is the more likely it is to stick in the mind. Elaboration is the key to the memory palace. Some people\u0027s memory palaces are rather barren, however. Notably, people who suffer from serious depression.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorDidn\u0027t someone around the table in Brussels raise their hand and say, \"Hey, wait a sec... do we really want to levy this tax on a banking system that\u0027s already teetering?\"Comments (46)Ryan NickumBlogger, Estately Real Estate SearchAll of these photographs instantly surprised us.CommentsMindy Trottabetterafter50.com, blogger, pastry chefWho says you can\u0027t have a great cocktail party during Passover? You can, and you should! Invite your friends over for a drink and appetizers.CommentsPenny Love HoffFitness/Lifestyle CoachLosing your memory is sort of like gaining weight; you don\u0027t quite know how it happened but one day your zipper won\u0027t quite zip. And the same thing happens mentally.Comments (15)Lacy MorrisD.C.-based travel and lifestyle writerYou should squeeze as much adventure as possible into your 20s before not-so-gracefully bowing out of the years of which you\u0027re still expected to brush off your mother\u0027s advice. Here are 30 things every person with a bit of wanderlust must see and do before they\u0027re 30.Comments (37)Vanessa Van EdwardsAuthor, Professional People WatcherAre we making ourselves busy to feel productive because it distracts us from our inner feelings of dissatisfaction?CommentsTammy Nelson, Ph.D.Sex and relationship expert; Psychotherapist; Author; International speakerThe immediate response after discovering a spouse\u0027s affair is commonly disbelief, anger, sadness, loss or grief.Comments (34)Amy DiElsiFuture Fortified CampaignToday\u0027s Global Mom Relay post comes to you from around the world. Members of India\u0027s Self Employed Women\u0027s Association, an organization of low-income self-employed women workers led by Reema Nanavaty, and Anna Ingwe.CommentsDr. R. Keith SawyerAssociate Professor, Washington University; Author, \u0027Group Genius: The Creative Power of Collaboration\u0027You probably think that memory is the exact opposite of creativity. After all, the things you memorize already exist, they\u0027re not new. And creativity is all about a new idea that didn\u0027t exist before... right?CommentsBrian Levin, J.D.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityWhile some are plausibly speculating that the murder of Tom Clements was possibly a direct organized hit by a violent gang, the 211 Crew\u0027s role could also have been a more nuanced one, of creating a violent lone wolf, from an unstable youth, who would later act on his own against a list of shared perceived enemies.CommentsMohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOEurope has more than an immediate economic and financial interest in working with Cyprus to stabilize an increasingly volatile situation. And it should do so driven less by the need avoid an institutional Eurozone exit and more by the importance of fundamentally restoring growth and hope to Cyprus.Comments (156)Raymond J. LearsyAuthor, \u0027Oil and Finance: The Epic Corruption Continues\u0027In a classic example of crony board behavior, in spite of the grossly embarrassing Senate hearings highlighting massive fissures in JP Morgan\u0027s trading oversight and management, the Board of Directors said on Friday they would continue to support Mr. Jamie Dimon as BOTH the bank\u0027s Chairman and Chief Executive.CommentsTom Zeller Jr.Senior Writer, The Huffington PostIs Earth Hour, the annual ritual in which people the world over turn out their lights as a show of solidarity in the fight against climate change and other environmental issues, a waste of time and energy? Bjorn Lomborg certainly thinks so.Comments (321)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorIronically, it\u0027s many of the same politicians who say they are \"tough on crime\" that are collecting millions of dollars in campaign money from the biggest crooks in America.Comments (183)Hope KronmanStudentWe will continue to find new and, I\u0027m sure, exhilarating ways to connect online. And while we do, we must not lose sight of the boundaries between real and virtual life.CommentsBill GeorgeProfessor of Management Practice, Harvard Business SchoolIn my experience, mindful people make much better leaders than frenetic, aggressive ones. They understand their reactions to stress and crises, and understand their impact on others. They are far better at inspiring people to take on greater responsibilities and at aligning them around common missions and values.Comments (18)Laura SchockerSenior Editor, Healthy LivingDespite being a stage-five worrier, I try to keep my anxiety in its proper perspective. But after researching and writing a piece published earlier this week about what stress is doing to your body, I realized I still have a long way to go when it comes to handling the ever-present stress in my life.Comments (42)Christine LagardeManaging Director, IMFThe goal of continued stability -- and certainly the hope for more broadly shared growth -- cannot be taken lightly. Everybody I spoke to in Algiers agreed the country needs a more open and diverse economy to create a bigger pie, and to ensure that all Algerians get their fair share in it.Comments (18)Regina Weinreich, 2013.23.03Don McNay, 2013.23.03Susan Buchanan, 2013.23.03Amy Hanauer, 2013.23.03George Heymont, 2013.23.03Fire, 2013.23.03The Orange Rhino, 2013.23.03Dr. Yanis Ben Amor, 2013.23.03Barbara Greenberg, 2013.23.03Peter Rollins, 2013.23.03Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"MOURNING IN AMERICA: THOUSANDS KILLED SINCE NEWTOWN1 DAY SINCE NEWTOWN37 DEAD  ",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
