{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonWith the holidays almost here, Cindi Leive, Mika Brzezinski and I have decided that there is no better time to unplug, recharge and renew ourselves in time for the new year. And what better way to do that than by unplugging and disconnecting from all our devices? Big Data, unfettered information, the ability to be in constant contact and our growing reliance on technology are all conspiring to create a noisy traffic jam between us and our place of insight and peace. So Cindi, Mika and I agreed we needed to go beyond our usual, day-to-day vows to take time away from our devices. We wanted to do something bigger. From Monday, Dec. 23, through Sunday, Dec. 29, we\u0027ll be taking time away from TV, social media and email -- and we hope you\u0027ll join us.Comments (22)Sen. Patty MurrayU.S. Senator from WashingtonThis is not the deal Democrats would have written on our own, and it\u0027s not the deal that Republicans would have written on their own. It\u0027s a compromise -- and can hopefully serve as a foundation for continued bipartisan work. But first, this bill needs to pass.Comments (47)Bob AllenSenior Manager, Chemistry/Materials, IBM Research\"Ninjas\" are coming to the rescue in the fight against superbugs. It\u0027s the kind of attack that this frightening wave of new bugs can\u0027t adapt to -- unlike antibiotics.CommentsJanet TavakoliPresident, Tavakoli Structured FinanceThe U.S. did not enforce existing securities laws, so no one should have confidence that new Dodd-Frank rules will have any meaningful impact. The U.S. banking system seems to have captured its regulators, Congress and the Treasury.Comments (19)Karl GudeCreative process \u0026 visual storytelling instructor at Michigan State University. Former InfoGraphics Director at Newsweek and The Associated Press.\"Sorry, as a magazine editor, I know what it\u0027s like to flip through dozens of shots to find the right one. And, do you know what gets my e-mail gong? \"That shot, her lipstick is smudged. Her shirt is wrinkled.\"Comments (14)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkDo we really believe that a young teenager from an inner city or from a rural area who had a rough upbringing would receive time at a treatment facility if he/she killed four people after driving drunk? I don\u0027t think so, and neither do the majority of us.Comments (126)Nathan AllenChemistIf a half-dozen volunteers can keep a page with more than 4 million users from being a microphone for the antiscientific, is it too much to ask for newspapers to police their own editorial pages as proficiently?Comments (69)Derek ShearerProfessor of Diplomacy at Occidental College and former US ambassadorChoice matters in politics, as in sports, especially at crucial moments. President Obama, too, has made choices in his presidency and whether they\u0027ve failed or succeeded, he has chosen to stand in the public arena.CommentsPamela MeyerFounder and CEO, CalibrateIf North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un had whispered to his uncle, \"Looking forward to seeing you over the holidays\" it would have taken the cake on this year\u0027s Top Ten List... but this year there were even stronger real contenders.CommentsJim SleeperLecturer in Political Science, Yale UniversityWhat makes the column still more revealing and sad is that, far from serving up an older but wiser man\u0027s humility, it recycles what Brooks has been saying quite often since even when he was younger and, one might have hoped, less cynical.CommentsPeter CappelliAuthor and Professor of Management at The Wharton SchoolMost of these companies want to refer to themselves and their employees as a kind of family, but what kind of family allows its members to go hungry? And what prevents you from doing something about it?Comments (271)James Howard KunstlerAuthor, \u0027The Long Emergency,\u0027 \u0027The Geography of Nowhere,\u0027 and the \u0027World Made By Hand\u0027 novelsThe so-called Volcker Rule for policing (ha!) banking practices, approved by a huddle of federal regulating agency chiefs last week, is the latest joke that America has played on itself in what is becoming the greatest national self-punking exercise in world history.CommentsAllen FrancesProfessor Emeritus, Duke UniversityThe history of psychiatry is a history of fad diagnoses that come out of nowhere to capture much more attention than they deserve. Current fads are distinguished only by the billions of dollars spent by powerful commercial forces to create and push them.CommentsValerie AlexanderAuthor, \u0027Happiness as a Second Language\u0027Choose the man who will take care of the laundry and change the baby\u0027s diapers when you\u0027ve got the flu, rather than the one who spent a month choreographing his proposal so that the video of it would go viral.Comments (115)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureIt\u0027s becoming increasingly clear that, at least politically, 2014 will be \"The Year of Economic Populism.\" Now the question is, who gets to decide what that really means?CommentsAdam GrantWharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027Here are a dozen books with big implications for the world of work that are likely to make a splash in the coming year.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorWhile today\u0027s debate asks whether inequality hurts growth, the oldsters among us remember the time when the received wisdom was pretty much the opposite: you can have strong aggregate growth or you can have equity, but you can\u0027t have both.Comments (53)John TirmanExecutive Director, MIT Center for International StudiesIsrael\u0027s belligerent and persistent obstructionism is not the action of an ally. It is time to lay that mythology to rest, and allow Israel to seek its best friends elsewhere.CommentsOliver TearleAuthor; Lecturer in English, Loughborough Univ.Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol in six weeks during October and November 1843, and it appeared just in time for Christmas, on December 17. The book\u0027s effect was immediate, and it has been credited with popularizing the phrase \u0027Merry Christmas.\u0027CommentsDahr JamailAuthor, \u0027Beyond the Green Zone: Dispatches from an Unembedded Journalist in Occupied IraqWe are currently in the midst of what scientists consider the sixth mass extinction in planetary history, with between 150 and 200 species going extinct daily, a pace 1,000 times greater than the \"natural\" or \"background\" extinction rate.Comments (12)Robert ScheerEditor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027Democrats bear as much responsibility as Republicans for allowing our once promising democracy to degenerate into a plutocracy of the irresponsible super-rich.CommentsAdam WinklerProfessor of Law, UCLAIs it time to rethink the longstanding ban on plural marriage? While the ability to choose one\u0027s sexual partners is an important element of constitutionally protected privacy, polygamy has long been associated with unique harmsComments (82)Dan GlickmanSenior Fellow at the Bipartisan Policy CenterIn these days of record-breaking-spending legislators and aspiring politicians, regardless of party, pursue campaign dollars from high-income donors as a matter of simple political survival. They follow the advice of Willie Sutton who, when asked why he robbed banks said, \"that\u0027s where the money is.\"CommentsSusannah LewisFreelance writer, blogger, aspiring best-selling author, wife, momI long for the days when Santa\u0027s helpers were mystical, magical, mysterious and unseen little people and not some overpriced brand. But, the times they are a-changing. If I must participate in this new \"tradition,\" I choose to let the elf serve it\u0027s purpose -- to set on a shelf and encourage my children to be \"nice.\"CommentsRobert P. Jones, Ph.D.CEO, Public Religion Research InstituteUpon further examination, the declining belief in the historical accuracy of the Christmas story tracks other related trends, such as a similar double-digit drop in belief that the Bible is the word of God.Comments (29)Jeff CohenAuthor and media criticI saw Noam Chomsky as my mentor -- way before we ever met. When I was in college in the late 1960s/early \u002770s, he was already a guiding light for me, an exemplar of how those with privilege and principles should live our lives.CommentsRandi WeingartenPresident, American Federation of TeachersWhat if, instead of using international rankings to bash our students, schools and teachers, we learned from top-performing countries and applied their lessons for the benefit of all children?Comments (54)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, Beyond OutrageIt\u0027s charity time, and not just because the holiday season reminds us to be charitable. As the tax year draws to a close, the charitable tax deduction beckons. If Congress ever gets around to revising the tax code, it might consider limiting the charitable deduction to real charities.Comments (53)John PavleyCTO @ The Huffington Post, BloggerI assume the term killer app came from the phrase \"to make a killing.\" I never thought much about the metaphor -- the use of the word \"killing\" as a synonym for \"succeeding\" or \"winning.\" But it\u0027s a little creepy to think about what the word killer really means. After all, a \"murder app\" or \"homicidal app\" doesn\u0027t sound appealing, and yet all these words are interchangeable synonyms.CommentsAnn JonesAuthor, \u0027They Were Soldiers: How the Wounded Return From America’s Wars -- The Untold Story\u0027The JROTC program, still spreading in high schools across the country, costs U.S. taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars annually. It has cost some unknown number of taxpayers their children.Comments (95)Noah MichelsonEditor, HuffPost Gay VoicesIt\u0027s time that we made a promise to ourselves that we won\u0027t look the other way any longer. It\u0027s time that we started challenging each other and ourselves to be accountable to what we believe and what we espouse.Comments (549)Tony NewmanDirector of Media Relations, Drug Policy Alliance2013 will go down in history as the beginning of the end of our disastrous war on drugs.
