{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundWhat is it going to take for us to stand up and say enough to this internal gun war of American against American? What is it going to take to create a mental health system that prevents such tragedies from happening over and over? What is it going to take for us to pass and enforce adequate gun safety laws? What is it going to take to love and protect human life, especially children more than guns? Is the doctor right that this is not America? Or is she calling for the America we must create together with urgency and persistence?Comments (321)Elizabeth DrewJournalistOnly the members of the electorate can restore the institutions and procedures that make our democratic system work, starting with the next chance they get.Comments (232)Dan PallottaAuthor of \"Uncharitable\"Could it be that everything we\u0027ve been taught about charity, and about giving, and about change is backwards? Is it possible that in the name of an ethic we are actually prolonging the suffering of millions of adults and children the world over?Comments (343)Jason KirellCombat veteran, former reporter and bloggerI didn\u0027t risk my life in Afghanistan so I could come back and watch people go hungry in America. I certainly didn\u0027t risk it so I could come back and go hungry. Anyone who genuinely supports cutting food stamps is not an intellectual or an ideologue -- they\u0027re a bully.Comments (1,914)Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOI am constantly cheering against the Patriots. My dislike of the Patriots has grown to such an extent that I am willing to give up on my favorite division and conference as long as it means a Patriots\u0027 defeat. Our Congress seems to be behaving in a similar way.CommentsNate PyleWriter, pastor, outdoor enthusiastIf you truly love a person, do not reduce them to an object. The moment you objectify another human -- woman or man, you give up your humanity.Comments (101)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorIt really does seem to be the case that the obstructionists are doing the bidding of their constituents. One House Republican was quoted in the paper the other day saying, essentially: the folks back in my district would rather see me work to shut down the government and default on the debt than compromise.Comments (157)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarExcessive violence in films and on TV has been joined by excessive sex, much of it acted out according to porn-established norms. Even if much of this is artistic commentary, without discussion, kids begin to believe this is how sex really works.Comments (120)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureForget the debt ceiling for a moment, if you can. Forget the GOP\u0027s attempt to shut down the government over the Affordable Care Act. Who is going to explain to the American people how profoundly misguided, and even immoral, the Republicans\u0027 entire economic agenda has become?Comments (785)James ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027The West is still mystified by the Arab World. Absent real understanding, our public discourse and, too often, our policy debates are informed by crude myths and negative stereotypes of the region, its culture and its people.CommentsEthan RomeExecutive Director, Health Care for America NowDespite how it looks right now, there is a solution to this mess in sight. In approving the continuing resolution tied to defunding Obamacare, John Boehner got rolled by the unhinged extremists. But he knows better. He started in the right place -- he should go back.Comments (14)Willie NelsonPresident of Farm AidToday, as the minutes tick down to another farm bill deadline, people in towns and cities everywhere are taking matters into their own hands. They\u0027re standing up with family farmers and insisting on food that is best for them and their families.Comments (685)Eric ReevesProfessor at Smith CollegeTo suggest that the terrors of children in Darfur, their pain and agony, as well as their deaths are any less \"morally obscene\" than gas attacks on children in Syria is a painfully invidious comparison -- the more so since in the end, it is politically expedient.Comments (29)Linda Bloom LCSW and Charlie Bloom MSWBestselling Authors and Relationship ExpertsInterrupting the daily routine with a getaway isn\u0027t a luxury, it\u0027s a necessity. And for us and many others, these breaks have meant the difference between having a thriving relationship and getting a divorce.CommentsFodor\u0027sFodors.comCome autumn, many of America\u0027s National Parks are at their most visually stunning. It\u0027s not only the fall foliage that amplifies their beauty, but also the waning light casting the landscape in an almost magical iridescence.CommentsRonna BenjaminManaging Editor/Boston www.betterafter50.comI\u0027ve had more than my share of fashion faux pas. I\u0027m the one who went to the bathroom before my court appearance and came back and pled the case for my client with my suit skirt tucked up into my panty hose. At my own engagement party, my future mother-in-law\u0027s friend wore the same dress as I did.Comments (285)Ira IsraelLos Angeles Psychotherapist \u0026 CounselorTrying to communicate anything of note via text message equals one thing: fear of intimacy. Anyone who can\u0027t pick up the phone or look you in the eye when conveying vital information suffers from a dreadful fear of abandonment which manifests as a fear of intimacy.CommentsGrand CousinBand\"Camera\" is a song about the paranoia that comes with passion.CommentsLauren DucaEditorial Fellow, The Huffington PostSince their inception, superhero films have succeeded economically and provided another example of the battle of good and evil, but they have yet to tap their most positive moral market.Comments (220)Paul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostPope Francis continues to radically refocus the Catholic Church and, even as a non-Catholic, I am beginning to view him as a personal pastor.Comments (644)Dan FroomkinExecutive Editor, FearlessMedia.orgThe important thing about this vote to anyone paying any attention at all was the subtext -- what it really meant. But the coverage was stenographic and context-deficient.Comments (426)Andrew YangI wanted to be a good non-profit leader, which cut against my instincts as a corporate leader. Why were the two so different?CommentsJohn PavleyCTO @ The Huffington Post, BloggerOver the last few days I\u0027ve listened to the \"same\" radio stations on both iTunes and Spotify. I\u0027ve streamed music with wired, wireless and 3G connections. I\u0027ve used headphones and speakers. I\u0027ve created custom stations. I\u0027m looking at variety, fit, quality, convenience and user experience.CommentsGina McCarthyAdministrator, U.S.Environmental Protection AgencyToday, the auto industry is thriving, and American consumers save about $8 thousand at the pump over the life of their vehicle. We can\u0027t solve climate change overnight -- but we can get closer to a solution.Comments (449)Josh HorwitzExecutive Director, Coalition to Stop Gun ViolenceWhen individuals like Aaron Alexis are not prohibited purchasers under existing federal law, it is obvious that universal background checks alone are not enough. We need to have a national discussion about expanding the disqualifying criteria.Comments (701)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027SNAP has enjoyed bipartisan support through the years, but now Congressional Republicans are determined to cut these critical nutrition programs to America\u0027s hungry.Comments (1,079)Ellen SeidmanBlogger, Love That MaxConsidering parents of kids with special needs to be saints overestimates us, and underestimates our children.Comments (119)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorPresident Obama is clearly aware of the risk associated with Wall Street misbehavior, but he has failed to champion significant reforms. Here are several suggestions that the president should consider.Comments (112)Arianna HuffingtonIn this week\u0027s issue, we feature the latest in our \"Invisible Casualties\" series on suicide in the military. In this installment, David Wood tells the story of Navy Petty Officer Joshua Lipstein, an Iraq war veteran whose struggle with drugs and depression ended when he took his own life at 23.CommentsElizabeth GoreResident Entrepreneur, United Nations FoundationI was very nervous to ask our leadership and board to give up $350,000 in those bed nets to pay for the overhead and infrastructure of creating a public campaign to raise awareness on malaria preventionCommentsNoel AlumitAuthor, State Commissioner, Divinity StudentIt is a small sorority of women who can call themselves Miss America. It gets even smaller when you consider how many women of color have won. This week, the sisterhood of Asian Miss Americas has grown to two.Comments (62)Michelle Chen, 2013.21.09André St. Clair, 2013.21.09Steve Mariotti, 2013.21.09Jamie Henn, 2013.21.09William Astore, 2013.21.09Mohamed A.
