{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Marty KaplanDirector, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg School\"Heat-Trapping Gas Passes Milestone, Raising Fears,\" ran the headline on the front page lead story in Saturday\u0027s New York Times, with this sub-head: \"CO2 at Level Not Seen in Millions of Years, Portending Major Climate Changes.\" A headline like that -- millions of years? really? -- normally turns up in comic books and superhero movies, not in the paper of record. In fiction, what usually comes next is a montage. At breakfast tables and on street corners, in souks and igloos, in the Oval Office and at the U.N., the shocking news galvanizes humanity into action. In the real world, it was pretty much a one-day story. What does it take to grab us by the eyeballs? Sure, disaster porn is always good for ratings, but though a Superstorm Sandy may momentarily raise the specter of climate change, daily bulletins on the parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere apparently aren\u0027t Nielsen enough.Comments (58)Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoI am a great admirer of Justice Ginsburg. But in her criticisms of Roe v. Wade, I must dissent. Roe transformed the lives of tens of millions of women in this nation. It was the right decision... and its time had come.Comments (297)Cathy YoungbloodHousekeeper, Hyatt AndazMost blogs that people read on here are written by pundits or political analysts, but very few are written by people who scrub toilets for a living. I do. But I am also a mother, grandmother, and proud of the work I do.Comments (18)Mike HoganExecutive Arts and Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post Media GroupWe have to start with the bear, right? That claw mark on Brienne\u0027s neck looked pretty fierce. She\u0027s gonna feel that in the morning. But I suspect the scar will always remind Jaime and Brienne of the ties that bind them.Comments (311)Elliott NeginDirector of News \u0026 Commentary, Union of Concerned ScientistsPart 1: Too often the news media have provided a platform for fossil fuel industry-funded think tanks and advocacy groups to make spurious claims about global warming and renewable energy and allowed them to pass themselves off as disinterested parties promoting free markets and limited government.Comments (121)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarSo much of the advice geared towards women who choose to go back to work, focuses on how they can learn to accept the sacrifices that go along with working while raising children. I\u0027d argue that in many cases, going back to work is not a sacrifice at all but the best decision a woman can make not only for herself, but also for her family.Comments (382)Paul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostEvery religious person should object to having the Ten Commandments in schools because you are allowing other people -- people over whom you have no control -- the responsibility of interpreting said commandments.Comments (422)Leo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersRepublicans want to kill the government that accomplished that. They want to go back to Downton Abbey days. The rich stay rich; the poor stay servants.Comments (255)Maureen RyanTV critic, The Huffington Post\"Man With a Plan\" was meant to make us feel the characters\u0027 dislocation, and all the office stuff worked. What bored me was the whole bit with Don and Sylvia in the hotel.Comments (106)Jeff DanzigerPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideComments (45)Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The more that the Obama administration tries to meet the Republicans half way, the more extreme and implacable their demands become. Obama\u0027s term still has more than three and a half years to run and Democrats still have a 55-45 majority in the Senate, but the Republicans are treating him like the lamest of lame ducks.Comments (596)Steven StraussAdjunct Lecturer in Public Policy, Harvard Kennedy SchoolAre Google\u0027s driverless car and Siri just the beginning for applied machine intelligence/Big Data? Automated trucks, for example, could eliminate millions of jobs. Will this type of automation be good or bad -- economically and socially? How will it transform society?Comments (37)Nathan J. WinogradDirector, No Kill Advocacy CenterTo those on the outside looking in, HSUS\u0027 lack of support for an animal abuse registry may seem like an anomaly. But for those on the inside, who have been laboring to end neglect, abuse and the killing of animals, it is clearly part of a recurring pattern that exemplifies the HSUS tenure of CEO Wayne Pacelle.CommentsRaffi CavoukianTroubadour, AuthorThe \"Lightweb\" is known to all who use the Internet as a daily part of life. We easily connect to anyone around the world, not just via email, but through a variety of online platforms and texting applications even on the smallest personal computing devices. The \"Darkweb\" is there too.Comments (25)Andreas SouvaliotisSocial EntrepreneurBack when I was a kid my birth country wasn\u0027t the land of debt defaults and massive layoffs, but it was already a very strange and extremely individualistic society.Comments (24)David PaulPresident, Fiscal Strategies GroupIf the world is to sustain the momentum of economic development that is essential to Jim Yong Kim\u0027s optimism, the companies and countries that have benefitted from expanding free trade have a collective stake in figuring out a path forward that stanches the downward spiral of the American middle class.Comments (213)Marc VetriHead Chef/Owner of Vetri, Osteria, Amis, Alla SpinaThis week is National Stuttering Awareness Week, and I\u0027d like to share with you one chef\u0027s personal story: mine.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorWhen economic \"rents\" or market failures provide economic benefits to weaker groups -- those with less stature or power in society -- efforts to eradicate such \"inefficiencies\" may further empower dominant elites in ways that are counterproductive for the larger society.Comments (39)Derek HartleyCo-host, \u0027Derek and Romaine\u0027 on SiriusXM OutQ 108; author, \u0027When Nightlife Falls\u0027Manhattan is awash with TV folks in town for the upfronts, the annual ritual in which the networks present their fall schedules to advertisers in hopes of wooing big bucks. It is too early to tell which network will be the big winner, but this year there is a clear loser: gay characters.CommentsLisa SolodCreator and Editor, \u0027Desire: Women Write About Wanting\u0027I want the mother back who was born sad and could not climb out of her sadness, but who managed a spectacular life. The woman who was born at the wrong time, married the wrong man and had the wrong children. The mother who gathered friends like an abundance of autumn leaves.CommentsJim MoretChief Correspondent, \u0027Inside Edition\u0027; attorney; author, \u0027The Last Day of My Life\u0027The Jodi Arias trial reminded me of the first \"Trial of the Century\" which I had anchored for CNN nearly two decades before. The OJ Simpson criminal trial ushered in a new era of cameras in the courtroom and TV trial addicts.Comments (118)Stuart MacleodHalf the Sky Movement documentary unit producerI know many people who have risen to greatness without suffering, but few of those exhibit the level of selfless altruism that I was exposed to in meeting the women and girls of Half the Sky.CommentsShannyn MooreJust a girl from Homer, AlaskaOur country\u0027s founding principles of habeus corpus were in a direct response to the \"lock them away in the Tower\" abuses in Britain. We were going to be different. Oh, I know Guantanamo isn\u0027t on American soil, but our flag flies over that prison -- the same one we pledge \"liberty and justice for all\" to.Comments (117)Deepak Chopra and Jim CliftonIn trying to give governments a more accurate picture of crime and fear, Gallup scientists found one survey question that gets to the heart of the matter: \"Do you feel safe walking alone at night in the city or area where you live?\"CommentsLarry MagidTechnology journalistThere are many reasons people use Snapchat and that, despite worries about sexting, most kids are using the app in ways that parents would probably approve of. But, it\u0027s also important for kids and adults to realize that there\u0027s no such thing content that absolutely disappears forever.Comments (12)HuffPost RadioSpitzer and Matalin debate if Benghazi will prove to be more Whitewater than Watergate. Is Toomey gutsy to chide the Right for opposing his bipartisan bill just to stymie Obama? Are tyrannical feds buying up ammo to undermine gun rights?CommentsFriends of Edna\u0027s Maternity HospitalFunding healthcare for women and children in SomalilandEdna Adan Ismail has literally committed everything she has to achieve one purpose: decreasing the newborn and maternal mortality rate in Somaliland and the Horn of Africa.CommentsZack HarrisSophomore, Northwestern UniversityDeath ends a life, but not a soul. The spirit lives on. But where does Facebook enter the picture? Does a Facebook profile get buried like a body? Or does it become a living spirit?Comments (27)Jackie Barden, Nicole Hockley, Nelba Marquez-Greene and Francine WheelerAs \"Sandy Hook Moms,\" we often hear the phrase \"I can\u0027t imagine what you are going through.\" Well, please imagine it. Imagine what it\u0027s like to lose a son or daughter to gun violence and encourage your elected officials to do the same.Comments (5,515)Casey Carey-BrownBlogger at Life With RoozleEven with the questions and the additional pressure, we realize our daughter was born in an amazing time.Comments (114)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; host, \u0027The Breakdown\u0027; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureWill California Attorney General Kamala Harris hang tough in her new lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase, the first to target individual bankers accused of defrauding the public? If so, it would be the first time in five years that executives at a major bank have personally paid a price for their misdeeds.Comments (56)Blake KernenA 7th grader from Morristown-Beard School, New JerseyInstead of falling head over heels for Jahar, here\u0027s a different idea: Fall in love with America and embrace all it has to offer: its promise of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. A love affair with America is guaranteed to be a much more rewarding.CommentsSue Kerr, 2013.13.05Sen. Barbara Boxer, 2013.13.05Richard C. Leone, 2013.13.05William Bradley, 2013.13.05Frank A.
