{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027This week marks the 7th anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the huge investment bank. This collapse set off the worldwide financial panic that brought Wall Street to its knees. The anniversary of this collapse, September 15, is the day set aside to ridicule the people who warned of a second Great Depression (SGD) if the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Board didn\u0027t rescue the Wall Street banks. Just to recount the basic story, there is no doubt that without a government bailout most of the big Wall Street banks would have gone under. There is no doubt that the initial downturn would have been more severe if the market was allowed to work its magic and put these banks out of business. But the question the SGD gang could never answer is how this collapse would prevent the government from boosting the economy immediately afterward?From neighborhoods to states, from the suburbs to the city, and from farms to factories, people are blazing a clean energy path to economic growth and greater equality.Oscar-nominated actor, climate change activistPresident Obama must know that it is impossible to protect the Arctic while allowing Shell to drill for oil 70 miles off the coast of Alaska. He cannot have it both ways. His policies and proclamations are irreconcilable.Founder and Chair, Bianca Jagger Human Rights FoundationWe just witnessed the embarrassing results of the last US attempt to train Syrians: only few completed the training, and once they reached Syria, they were ambushed, shot, kidnapped, or went missing.Professor of international relations, George Washington UniversityThe military cemeteries of the United States, whether on American soil or foreign shores, contain the remains of men whom war has taken from their families. Any loss of a life is a tragedy, but the unfulfilled human potential that perishes as a result of war is doubly so.Author, \u0027Dangerous Ground\u0027The most amazing -- and decidedly Christian -- thing Francis has done since ascending to the papacy is his not-so-subtle attempt last week to welcome divorcees back to the church\u0027s fold. The move not only shows signs of a warmer, gentler Church, it also embraces and (literally) legitimizes people like me.Writer, TV Journalist, Mom of FourFor workers like me, $15 an hour means being able to feed my family without worrying that we\u0027re taking money we need for the gas or water bill or for bus passes. It means being able to see my kids grow up. It means real change in our lives.KFC employee, Fight for $15 advocateRepublicans know they can\u0027t beat Hillary fair and square. All they can do is hope to confuse and exhaust enough Democrats who lose their nerve and chicken out when it comes to refuting false attacks on her.Founder, Media Matters for AmericaAs we remember on September 15, please pause to know that for many, justice forgot. Maybe this year we can work to change the philosophy that is still at work in our nation that produces hate and murder.Pastor / Writer / MomWhat Donald Trump doesn\u0027t understand is this. Historically speaking, government antipoverty programs haven\u0027t weakened the work incentive. On the contrary, welfare has provided the temporary lifeblood that Sarah, her daughter, and thousands of law-abiding citizens like them depend on, not for convenience, but for survival.Technology Analyst at R/GAAfter six years of silent preparations, the Obama White House has recently unveiled some bold diplomatic initiatives. As these moves unfold, Obama is revealing himself as one of those rare grandmasters who appear every generation or two with an ability to go beyond mere foreign policy and play that ruthless global game called geopolitics.Professor of History at the University of Wisconsin-MadisonAs proud as I am to discuss my heritage, I was constantly put down in school for claiming to be \"something I\u0027m not.\" My light olive-colored skin is all that people needed to know to slap a label on me and call me white. I wanted so badly to represent the culture I held so close to my heart in a physical way, but I couldn\u0027t.Actress/SingerThe record industry is a mere shadow of its former self (apt punishment for its cowardice), and CD\u0027s and vinyl albums have almost become \"novelties\" in a world driven by downloads. Yet, the warning labels still adorn individual track listings and albums online.rock star, radio show host, actor, writer, television personalityI also have images from Macedonia burned into my mind. We experienced absolute horrors there. We were carted in a train to the Serbian border. We couldn\u0027t move, and had to wait -- anxious and afraid -- for many hours. We were like animals in a cage.17-year-old from Damascus, SyriaSanders should learn from what happened with Black Lives Matter. A candidate can\u0027t rely on people knowing what he\u0027s done in the past and needs to both speak about that past record and about what he\u0027s going to do right now.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostWhat else don\u0027t our elected officials know? And should we be concerned? More important, can we do anything to ensure that our representatives are informed on important issues?Psychologist; Journalist; College ProfessorI\u0027m not obsessed with Burning Man, I don\u0027t spend my whole year planning for it, I don\u0027t have a playa name, and I don\u0027t think of it as my \"home.\" But I do think the culture it has created is amazing and impressive, and I\u0027m bothered by how much people are missing the forest of values preservation for the trees of commercial intrusion. Founder, ClimateTruth.org / Director CEL Climate LabThe second debate of the Republican nomination race is fast approaching, so in preparation I thought it would be a good time to take a look at the entire GOP field once again. First, though, a word about the debates themselves.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comLet\u0027s pay close attention to what happens in Europe in the wake of two events of major importance: the Greek crisis, with the attendant risk of failure of the Euro area, and the refugee tragedy, which has reached massive proportions against a backdrop of growing populist, demagogic, xenophobic, and racist tendencies.MEP, President of Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European ParliamentA rights regime -- and that is what the liberal state is -- is largely indifferent to the content of the rights being exercised and cares only that, when exercised, they leave room for the exercise of those same rights by others.Davidson-Kahn Distinguished University Professor and Professor of Law at Florida International University; Floershimer Distinguished Visiting Professor of Law at Cardozo Law SchoolCall your state senators, your assembly members, your mayors, and your city councils. Tell them that you want to protect your kids. You want to protect your communities. Hell, you want to protect yourself.Navy veteran and Co-Director of the Truman National Security Project San Diego ChapterA review of Israel\u0027s detention policy reveals how outrageous and convoluted the legal system behind this policy is. Israel maintains a perpetual state of emergency as a political tool to provide the legal rationale, however twisted, for the policy of continuing administrative detention.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUThe U.S. will arrive with its strongest-ever commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, with a proven record of success over the past decade, and with a Clean Power Plan from the EPA that can get us all the way to a 30 percent reduction in emissions and beyond. We\u0027re not alone, either.Executive Director, The Sierra ClubI\u0027m tired of it because, at best it silences women and keeps their voices out of the pulpits and the classrooms. At worst it traps women and girls in abusive and damaging situations, and fuels a culture of male privilege and power.Pastor, Wife, MotherI was naive, scared and broke yet determined to enhance my foreign language studies. Looking back, it amazes me that I even made it through the process of getting there, however, it can certainly be done.A place to find useful information from the people who\u0027ve been there. Learn from others. Adult together.The genie cannot be put back in the bottle and wars cannot \"unhappen\". Yet besides the humanitarian help which decency dictates should be offered to refugees, the resort to diplomacy instead of war would also help millions of people now fleeing their countries and trying to make a new life elsewhere.Professor, l\u0027Université Paris Ouest NanterreBy Tony Abbott\u0027s reckoning there are two main culprits in the growing toxicity of the Australian landscape -- poll-driven politicians and a \"febrile\" media that \"rewards treachery.\"Editor-in-Chief, HuffPost AustraliaThe SDGs and Universal Declaration should be a packaged deal. At UNGA, leaders will commit themselves to the former. But for that commitment to bear fruit, they must also rededicate themselves to the latter.President, Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human RightsYour attention is limited and when it is soaked up with destructive or useless thinking, there is little left to give to the things that really matter. Give up these seven types of thinking patterns and see how your life benefits from living in the present moment.Author, mind gardener and attention activist www.mindgardener.comAs men, we must grant ourselves permission to be emotionally vibrant human beings; we must liberate ourselves to live in a much wider range of ways. But when I talk about this liberation of men, self-described traditionalists raise objections.The conversation no one else is having.The International Crisis Group\u0027s overconfidence in the Syrian regime\u0027s suicide not only encouraged the disastrous rejection of diplomacy that has helped prolong the Syria war. It also abdicated the main role for which peace, promotion, and conflict mitigation NGOs exist in the first place.Co-founder of Mideastwire.com and editor of the book, “Voice of Hezbollah: The Statements of Sayyid Hassan Nasrallah”Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
