{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AriannaAnother Sunday, another look back at some of the most interesting posts of the past week. The biggest story this week was, of course, the Deep Throat reveal … and our bloggers took it on from many angles. Check out Nora Ephron’s and Bob Levey’s insider takes, Paul Krassner’s historical perspective, and John Conyers weighing in on the story’s current ramifications. Our bloggers also offered takes on what should have been the biggest story of the week -- Iraq -- including posts from Jesse Kornbluth, Randall Robinson, and Hooman Majd. And, as always, our HuffPost bloggers fixed their gaze on a wide range of hot topics, including the EU vote, Ford’s homosexual relations, the debate over stem cells, and the future of the labor movement. Plus, there was plenty of funny stuff -- including a post from Larry Gelbart, this video treat from Harry Shearer… and this hilarious video remix of what happened when Tom met Oprah.05.31.2005 Nora EphronFor many years, I have lived with the secret of Deep Throat’s identity. It has been hell, and I have dealt with the situation by telling pretty much anyone who asked me, including total strangers, who Deep Throat was. Not for nothing is indiscretion my middle name. I knew that Deep Throat was Mark Felt because I figured it out. Carl Bernstein, to whom I was married for a brief time, certainly would never have told me; he was far too intelligent to tell me a secret like that.permalink06.03.2005 Jonathan AlterLast week I wrote a column in Newsweek that essentially argued for a new kind of politics in this country that revolves around embryonic stem cell research. (It\u0027s personal with me -- I underwent an adult stem cell transplant last year for lymphoma. I\u0027m in remission and feeling good, but it wasn\u0027t curative; embryonic stem cells might be.) I got some nice mail and comments in the blogosphere, but no one came forward with what I had hoped -- a plan to build a political movement. Am I missing something? This seems like a natural to me, given that almost every American has a relative or friend with a disease that could be cured with stem cell research.read whole post | permalink | comments05.31.2005 Bill MaherWatching Memorial Day coverage, I don\u0027t know how this country keeps a straight face. So much rhetoric, so little action. So much about past wars, so little about doing something for the soldiers suffering right now in this one in Iraq/Afghanistan.permalink | comments06.01.2005 Danielle CrittendenThe French have declared a resounding “Non!” to the European Constitution. Political analysts tell us that the French rejected the constitution because the document was confusing, long-winded, and ultimately suspicious -- not unlike their politicians or, come to think of it, their movies. Perhaps it would help reassure the French if the following amendments were added...permalink | comments06.02.2005 Matt CooperI was delighted to see that a bipartisan group of attorneys general from the states and the District of Columbia have filed a brief to the Supreme Court asking them to take the case that I’ve brought to the high court.permalink05.31.2005 Andy SternAt the 50th anniversary of the AFL-CIO the debate is in full swing. I say we need to change and build a new, growing, dynamic, modern labor movement for the 21st century. The current President, John Sweeney, says go slow -- it is unrealistic to expect us to change, and after all we cannot grow until we change public policy and labor laws. Sorry, but workers can\u0027t wait that long.permalink | comments05.31.2005 Larry GelbartA is for Abu-Graib. Admission accomplished. Happily, all of the women responsible for perpetrating the torture, degradation and unspeakable humiliation have been named and/or punished. B is for Bolton, hard-driving, hard-headed, abusive, butt-kicking diplomat. C is for Congress. A debatable society -- formerly a separate branch of the US government.permalink | comments06.02.2005 Kelly PrestonWhere in all of medicine is a diagnosis of disease made strictly by talking to someone? Would a parents subject their child to chemotherapy if there were no evidence of cancer cells? Would they take a doctor’s word for it that he could diagnose their child with cancer simply by asking the child some questions or observing his behavior?read whole post | permalink05.31.2005 Ed MarkeyIn December 2004, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that AstraZeneca\u0027s cancer product, Iressa -- which had been approved through the FDA\u0027s accelerated approval process -- was not an effective treatment for most cancer patients. I was shocked that more than 15,000 Americans were spending about $1,800 a month for a drug that probably wouldn\u0027t work. After asking a few questions, what I learned was even more shocking.permalink06.03.2005 Adam McKayIf you happen to be a W. Bush supporter who\u0027s skimming through the Huffington Post to see who the liberal traitors and agitators are, I have some questions for you. And these are honest, \"I really am looking for an answer\" questions, not rhetorical snarky questions. I\u0027m really looking to figure out this divide in our country between the so called true patriots and the shiftless liberals. So help me out and then when you see me on the road with my \"Wal-Mart: Low Wages, Low Morals... Always\" bumper sticker, feel free to flip me off.read whole post | permalink | comments06.01.2005 Paul FeigThank GOD that the American Family Association has finally boycotted Ford for being \"the company which has done the most to affirm and promote the homosexual lifestyle\"! My only beef with the AFA is that it\u0027s not going far enough. For instance, I know for a fact that kids are still reading in their history books about the Enola Gay. And what about that Ben Gay stuff you rub on your sore muscles? Why not just put a disco ball and a bottle of Captain Morgan in the box with it?permalink | comments06.01.2005 Erica JongGod knows it’s no fun to think about nuclear incineration. It’s really depressing. I look at my 16-month old grandson, Max, and I try to wrap my mind around a nuclear accident in New York and my mind just doesn’t want to go there. But let’s get real. The materials are there. The terrorists are there. Nine countries have nukers and counting. Why is nobody focusing on this? As we used to say in the 60’s, what do you do in the case of a terrorist with a loose nuke? “Bend over and kiss your ass goodbye.”permalink06.03.2005 Gary HartAmerican political parties, as we have known them for two centuries, are disintegrating. They are being replaced by shifting coalitions that are forming and reforming constantly. This transition is leaving an awful lot of Americans adrift...read whole post | permalink | comments06.03.2005 Jesse KornbluthHidden in the \"Leave No Child Behind\" Act is a demand for public high schools to give contact information for its students to military recruiters. Gee, why would recruiters want that information? Maybe so they can call kids turning 18 and suggest they\u0027d do well to \"be all you can be.\" What happens if a school refuses to hand over those phone numbers? It could lose federal funds -- and, in effect, leave all its students behind...read whole post | permalink | comments05.30.2005 Hooman MajdEverybody, including most of the Democratic leadership, seems to have bought into the idea that we can’t leave Iraq, that we can’t leave something unfinished. That Iraq will become unstable, that the region\u0027s instability will affect our national security. That we’ll lose face. No, nothing will happen that won’t happen anyway. Every last soldier; just pack up and leave. It took twelve days to get to Baghdad? How about two months to leave.permalink06.01.2005 Randall RobinsonThey are dead. Forever dead. All 1665 of them. All 100,000 of the Iraqi men, women, and children as well. Gone. Sons. Daughters. Fathers who never met their children. As if they were discardable. Ephemeral. Units of war room data. Gone. All of them. Dying still. Every day. Right up until our inevitable departure, after which, the news theater will go dark and none of us will know what happened next, and we will all forget, our dead and theirs, because that is what we have developed a habit of doing.permalink | comments06.02.2005 Bob LeveyI sat right between The Boys, when our hair was dark and blood was in the air. To my left, Bob Woodward -- intense, methodical, precise, ambitious. To my right, Carl Bernstein -- who never met a moment he didn\u0027t enjoy, a woman he didn\u0027t try to enjoy or a situation he didn\u0027t try to charm his way through. I divide them as follows: I once asked Bob for five bucks. He lent me ten. Carl once asked me for five bucks. He owes it to me still. Of course, they belong to the ages now, thanks in large part to Redford, Hoffman and that delusional wonder, Richard Nixon...permalink | comments05.31.2005 Rep. John ConyersToday we learned “Deep Throat\u0027s\" true identity -- W. Mark Felt, the then Deputy Director of the FBI. As one who was a first-hand witness to Watergate, I can only state humbly that this man helped bring our country back from the constitutional brink of an out-of-control White House, and the entire nation owes him a debt of gratitude.permalink | comments05.31.2005 Paul KrassnerThree weeks after the Watergate break-in, Mae Brussell completed a lengthy article for my magazine, The Realist, documenting the conspiracy and delineating the players all the way up to FBI director L. Patrick Gray and the president himself. Brussell also wrote about the murder of Ruben Salazar, a Los Angeles Times reporter. She called L.A. District Attorney Robert Meyer, asking if he would help with her research. A month later, Meyer was found dead in a parking lot in Pasadena. And now L. Patrick Gray was involved in an even bigger cover-up.permalink | comments06.04.2005 Joseph NyeWith the Dutch following the French rejection of the proposed European constitution, the second (wooden) shoe has dropped on the project. Despite efforts by some leaders to postpone the inevitable and imagine re-voting in the future, this cumbersome constitution is dead.read whole post | permalink | comments","h1":"",".title":"","h2":"On The Blog NowDeep Throat and Me: Now It Can Be Told, and Not for the First Time EitherWho\u0027ll Build the \"Pro-Cure\" Stem Cell Movement?So Much Rhetoric, So Little ActionA CONSTITUTION EVEN THE FRENCH COULD LIKEProtecting SourcesIt\u0027s Time for a Change at the AFL-CIOA Grimmer PrimerFighting for KidsWhat Are They Waiting For?Some Honest Questions for Bush Republicans From a Liberal PussyFINALLY!!!Loose NukesThe Parties Are OverHow to (help) stop the war: Opt Your Kid OutHasta La Vista, IraqSending Children to DieThe Next Watergate: It Won\u0027t Happen Without \u0027Big Journalism\u0027Where is Today\u0027s Deep Throat?The Devil in Deep ThroatEurope\u0027s second shoe dropsFree Phone Calls.
