{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"George LakoffAuthor, \u0027The Political Mind,\u0027 \u0027Moral Politics\u0027 and \u0027Don\u0027t Think of an Elephant!\u0027President Obama has reframed his position on Syria, adjusting the Red Line metaphor: It wasn\u0027t his Red Line, not his responsibility for drawing it. It was the Red Line drawn by the world, by the international community -- both legally by international treaty, and morally by universal revulsion against the use of poison gas by Assad. It was also America\u0027s Red Line, imposed by America\u0027s commitment to live up to such treaties. The reframing fit his previous rationale for the Red Line: to uphold international treaties on weapons of mass destruction, both gas and nuclear weapons. By this logic, the Red Line therefore applies not just to Assad\u0027s use of sarin, but potentially to Iran\u0027s development of nuclear weapons. The new version of the metaphorical policy has broad consequences.Comments (204)John KerryU.S. Secretary of StateI\u0027m sometimes asked how, as someone who testified 42 years ago against the Vietnam War in which I had fought, I could testify in favor of action to hold the Assad regime accountable today. The answer is, I spoke my conscience in 1971 and I\u0027m speaking my conscience now in 2013.Comments (1,252)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027When a head of state is responsible for the deaths of 100,000 of his people and has used chemical weapons against innocent civilians -- the world needs to respond. Doing nothing is not an option. But how should we respond, and what are moral principles for that response?Comments (180)Barbra StreisandSinger; Actress; Director; Composer; ActivistOur voter participation rates are already among the lowest in the world\u0027s democracies, but conservatives seem intent on lowering it further. But guns, why, owning them should be easier than ever.Comments (1,142)Jane McGonigalWorld-renowned designer of alternate reality gamesIt was the strangest thing. A gasp went up in the audience. Just when I was finding the courage to discuss the darkest moment in my life, we were literally plunged into darkness together.Comments (15)Jon SoltzCo-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranThere is no such thing as non-combat troops when it comes to Syria. Just being over there constitutes being in a potential combat operation. It constitutes being put into harm\u0027s way.Comments (58)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesMasha Gessen believes that it\u0027s time for Russian LGBT people to flee the country to escape what she says has now become \"all-out war\" against LGBT people in Russia. And she\u0027s calling on the United States to allow political asylum for LGBT Russians.Comments (47)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarThink hard: When\u0027s the last time you took credit -- really took credit -- for a job well done? Without giving props to others, shying away from praise or otherwise shifting the recognition to anyone but yourself?CommentsRalph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorNow, as if having learned nothing from the devastating and costly aftermaths of the military invasions of Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya, you\u0027re beating the combustible drums to attack Syria -- a country that is no threat to the U.S. and is embroiled in complex civil wars under a brutal regime.Comments (73)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundFar too many young Black boys are only hearing the first part of the message - -\"You can\u0027t do it.\" We need supports in place to show them that they can choose a different path.CommentsKen ReedSports Policy Director, League of FansWhen you ask both kids and adults these questions, the answer is usually some variation of \"It\u0027s fun!\" Yet if a visitor from another galaxy watched how we act on our sporting fields, courts, and in our stadiums and arenas, that visitor would never guess we were partaking in sports for fun.CommentsImam Abdullah AntepliMuslim Chaplain, Duke UniversityIt has been an incredibly rewarding and humbling 10 years for the Anteplis. Only a decade later, that broke graduate student and his family have not only established themselves successfully and put their roots in this beautiful country, but more importantly, we feel more at home here in the U.S. than anywhere else in the world.CommentsMedea BenjaminCo-founder, CODEPINK: Women for PeaceThe clock is ticking, with President Obama and Secretary Kerry frantically selling a war that the American people don\u0027t want to buy. If Congress goes ahead and approves military action, they -- unlike their British counterparts -- will fail to represent the people who elected them.Comments (88)Kateri AllardRegistered nurseI am a nurse. I didn\u0027t become a nurse because I couldn\u0027t cut it in med school or failed organic chemistry, but rather because I chose this. This wasn\u0027t my plan B. It was my plan A.Comments (11)Amanda SchumacherVP, Global Lifestyle Communications \u0026 Partnerships for The Huffington Post Media GroupIt\u0027s up to you, our readers, to let the world know. For the third year running, Adweek has asked readers to vote for the hottest digital, TV and print brands. And we\u0027re happy to report that HuffPost made the list in the \"Hottest News Site\" and \"Hottest News App\" categories.Comments (22)Novak DjokovicProfessional athleteAt one point or another, we all had a dream. Some of us wanted to become doctors, others wanted to fly planes, and I wanted to be the number one tennis player in the world. Unfortunately, many children are not as fortunate as I have been, and don\u0027t have the support to dream freely.CommentsDennis J. KucinichFmr. 16-year Member of US Congress; Two-time US Presidential CandidateThe American people have a right to a full release and vetting of all facts before their elected representatives are asked to make a decision of great consequence for America, Syria and the world.Comments (923)David BromwichProfessor of Literature, Yale UniversityThis House desires to obtain a full knowledge of the facts that go to establish whether it should vote for war against the government of Syria.Comments (106)Bob BurnettBerkeley writer, retired Silicon Valley executiveMost Americans believe that Bassar al-Assad is a bad guy and probably used chemical weapons on his people. We feel sorry for the Syrian civilians. But we also feel sorry for working-class Americans who are struggling to keep their heads above water.Comments (33)Gavin de BeckerSecurity specialist; Founder, Gavin de Becker \u0026 AssociatesToday, we are warned by John Kerry and others that if we don\u0027t act with lethal force, the Syrian government will kill thousands more people. Let\u0027s not be deluded: When we do intervene militarily, the Syrian government (and we) will kill thousands more.Comments (422)Adam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; founder of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911A great number of Americans are redefining the American Dream. That was the takeaway from a recent Credit.com poll, which showed that nearly one in four people between the ages of 18 and 24 defined the American Dream as being debt-free. Shockingly, that\u0027s more than those who dream of owning a home.Comments (79)Marisa McPeck-StringhamBlogger, Iron DaisyI know your family would not be thrilled at the thought of my teenage daughter seeing you only in your towel. Did you know that once a female sees you in a state of undress, she can\u0027t ever un-see it? You don\u0027t want my daughter to only think of you in this sexual way, do you?Comments (525)Stephen SchlesingerAuthor and Fellow at the Century FoundationI am sympathetic to Obama\u0027s notion that the international community should enforce the global prohibition against the use of ghastly chemical weapons in wartime against civilians. But I believe the president has chosen the wrong time and the wrong place to enforce this.Comments (12)Arianna HuffingtonAloha! I\u0027m here for the launch of our newest edition, HuffPost Hawaii. We are delighted to be partnering with Honolulu Civil Beat, a beacon of journalism in Hawaii focusing on public affairs and investigative reporting, with deep roots in the local culture.Comments (254)Meghan VenturaCommunity Manager, Games for ChangeWant more resilience-building, life-lengthening games after watching Jane McGonigal\u0027s TEDTalk?

This is one of those movies that, even as I sit here typing, I am still trying to like it more than I actually did.CommentsTerry O\u0027NeillPresident, National Organization for WomenThere has never been a woman chair of the Fed, and correcting that inequity is long overdue, but it\u0027s also true that Dr. Yellen is the best person for the job, male or female.Comments (129)Adam DenenbergVP Engineering @ Huffington PostWhy is Erlang important? To put it simply, the world of CPU computing and the impact to the applications that run on them has changed, somewhat drastically.Comments (11)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Even if the president musters enough votes to strike Syria, at what political cost? Any president has a limited amount of political capital to mobilize support for his agenda, in Congress and, more fundamentally, with the American people.Comments (265)Joseph A.
