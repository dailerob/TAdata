{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOThe good news -- and it is very good news -- is that Congress seems to have finally struck a deal that would reopen the government and dodge a debt default. In doing so, lawmakers have avoided (at least for now) a crisis of their own creation that would have tipped the country into recession, caused substantial job losses, and further eroded America\u0027s global standing -- all of which would have also undermined national security. Yet the good news is not the result of a visionary solution that reconciles, even in a limited fashion, material differences of views on the size and scope of government; nor does it fundamentally realign political incentives in a constructive manner. What emerged from Congress on Wednesday speaks to stop-gap measures born of exhaustion and political miscalculations, and prompted by national (and global) outrage.CommentsHoward FinemanEditorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupWin-win is a cool idea -- for social media and much of business life. But America\u0027s public and entertainment culture wants a narrative of total victory, crushing blows, winner-take-all contests and paranoid, apocalyptic sagas.Comments (1,742)Niels Gerson LohmanWriter, designer, musicianI have been cursed at a Chinese border. In Dubai, my passport was studied by three veiled women for over an hour and my suitcase completely dismembered. In the Philippines I had to bribe someone in order to get my visa extended for a few days. But never, ever, will I return to the United States of America.Comments (3,792)Emily Grace MehrerReference librarianThe Rhode Island Library Association (RILA) is challenging people to check their preconceived library notions at the door.Comments (87)Norman LearFounder, People for the American WayTo your knowledge has anyone ever exploded, you know, burst apart, like if we humans had seams, and once in a great while someone just bursts open and guts and sh*t shoot out in every direction? Has that ever happened to anyone you have ever known or heard of?Comments (66)Adam GrantWharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027Strategic optimists and defensive pessimists succeed under different circumstances. If you\u0027re a defensive pessimist, or you\u0027re attempting to motivate one, the strategies that prove effective are often the reverse of what you expect.Comments (31)Princess Haya Al HusseinUN Messenger of PeaceToday, in scores of nations across the globe, there will be conferences, speeches and editorials to celebrate World Food Day. School children will learn all about the latest issues -- fast food versus slow food; food losses and waste; farming and global warning.

There\u0027s no point in denying so-called aging -- it\u0027s something I wasn\u0027t always convinced I\u0027d be here to witness -- but I can\u0027t help getting my real age number stuck in my throat when I have to actually say it.Comments (28)Lemony SnicketAuthorFrom time to time people say to me, \"Lemony Snicket, you write dreadful and shocking books.

The name of this game is politics. Here\u0027s who came out a winner, and who bears the loser label.CommentsDan GolemanAuthor, \u0027Focus: The Hidden Driver of Excellence\u0027Being able to keep your focus amidst the daily din of distraction makes you better able to use whatever talents you need to apply -- whether making a business plan or a cheese soufflé.

Richard BlumenthalU.S. Senator from ConnecticutCompanies across America face few if any obstacles in ensuring women have paths to leadership. That is why it is shocking and deeply disappointing to see more and more evidence that the boardrooms of corporate America remain exclusively a men\u0027s club.CommentsElizabeth Grace SaundersFounder, Real Life E Time Coaching \u0026 TrainingExercise is one of the most important things you can do for physical and personal balance.

Why, they must be thinking, is this any different? What\u0027s the big deal?Comments (145)Eric IdleEnglish comedian, Monty PythonCurrently you appear to be almost in a state of civil war. If one party can shut down the government, then the social compact to rule is broken.
