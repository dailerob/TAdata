{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Howard FinemanEditorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupAs much as showing me a father\u0027s quiet love, my dad taught me life lessons by using the history and proper practices of baseball as his guide. He had been a ball player as a kid, and a lifelong student of the game. Perhaps because we listened to so many \"foreign\" broadcasts, my dad hated \"homers\" -- that is, play-by-play announcers who would ignore the facts and shade their analyses so they could curry cheap favor with the hometown radio audience. (Hey, wait a minute! That is exactly what is happening in Washington, not only in Congress but everywhere else in the city!) He told me that the worst thing you could be when you were at bat was a \"rabbit ears\" -- that is, someone who got upset and distracted by the cheap taunts from the dugout of the other team. (The Congress is full of those kinds of people.)CommentsJason LinkinsEditor, Eat the PressMonday night\u0027s bicameral back and forth between the House GOP and the Senate ended in the way everyone saw coming: a shutdown of the federal government, owing to the House Republicans\u0027 refusal to simply send the Senate the \"clean\" continuing resolution that everyone knew would have ended the futile contretemps right then and there.Comments (920)Caleb BarlowDirector of Mobile Security, IBMWhether in junior high or in college, many students have one thing in common: a smartphone or tablet is in their pocket or backpack. According to eMarketer, by the end of 2013, smartphone users will represent over half of all mobile phone users. And by 2016, nearly three in five Americans will have a smartphone, including students.CommentsMorris W. O\u0027KellyHost of \"The Mo\u0027Kelly Show\" on KFI AM640/XM Satellite Radio and \"Mo\u0027Kelly in the Morning\" on KTLK AM1150This ideological battle is not about changing a law, but subverting the Constitution. The Constitution is clear about how we change and amend laws. A shutdown is not one of the listed remedies.Comments (115)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarThe trick with selfies may be to look at why you\u0027re taking them -- and what they do for you. Posting affirming selfies can be empowering. But they can also help reinforce the idea that what matters most in this world is how things, and people, look.CommentsSen. Bernie SandersIndependent U.S. Senator from VermontIt is unconscionable that in one of the most advanced nations in the world, there are nearly 50 million people who lack health insurance and millions more who have burdensome copayments and deductibles.Comments (889)Grover NorquistPresident, Americans for Tax ReformIn normal times the Republican House and Democrat Senate would meet in conference committees and hash out each budget. But that has not happened under Obama. There has been no compromising or negotiations or even civility.Comments (108)Rachel M. MartinWriter, Findingjoy.netI want my kids to remember that there were times when their mother looked them in the eye and smiled. And for me, this often means shutting my laptop, putting down my phone, taking a break from my my to-do list and just giving them time.Comments (73)Marc EckoFounder, *Ecko Unltd.How, exactly, do you become a household name? What\u0027s the road map? Who are the benchmarks? Who\u0027s the best at influencing how people are made to feel?CommentsRussell SimmonsFounder, GlobalGrind.comIf the Republicans, specifically the members of the Tea Party, want to play games with our economy, he shouldn\u0027t give them an inch. Tell the Tea Party that they can\u0027t hijack our government and to take a seat. Stand strong, Mr. President, we got your back.Comments (200)David CoatesWorrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsThe government is being shut down for a reason, and we need to examine that reason. We need to ask our Republican Congressmen and women exactly which bits of the ACA are such a threat to individual freedom in America that resistance to them warrants closing down the government?Comments (377)Maureen RyanTV critic, The Huffington Post\"Breaking Bad\" went from a show with an unsparing eye to a show that, at the very end, didn\u0027t really want to look.Comments (425)Roslyn M. BrockChairman, NAACP National Board of DirectorsWe are at the dawn of a new day as our nation moves one step closer to becoming the more perfect union our forefathers envisioned. Beginning this month, nearly 48 million uninsured Americans will embark upon a path toward high-quality health care.Comments (17)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureThis is no longer a hostage negotiation. It has become something far more unpredictable, and therefore much more frightening. Republicans have come full circle from the days when Ronald Reagan proclaimed that \"it\u0027s morning in America.\" It\u0027s midnight in John Boehner\u0027s America.Comments (283)Eric BoehlertSenior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaWhat\u0027s been clear for years is that the press clings to its preferred storyline: When Republicans obstruct Obama\u0027s agenda, the president\u0027s to blame for not changing the GOP\u0027s unprecedented behavior. In other words, \"both sides\" are to blame.Comments (47)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorWhat we definitely do know beyond the shadow of a doubt is that any of these costs are way too high for a recovery that\u0027s already fragile and a job market that\u0027s already too weak.Comments (12)Morgan GuytonAssociate Pastor, Burke United Methodist ChurchOn the eve of our government shutdown, I wanted to do some research into the theological roots of Senator Ted Cruz, the standard-bearer of the Tea Party Republicans behind the shutdown.Comments (121)Danielle CrittendenContributing Editor, The Huffington PostMarcella Hazan\u0027s Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking features a photograph of Marcella and her husband arm-in-arm, smiling and touching each other in a way that suggests many years of happy intimacy. Newly married, we both wanted to be that couple some day.CommentsJoseph A. PalermoProfessor, historian, authorThe 2013 Republican shutdown of the United States government could be far more damaging to the country than the previous GOP-led crusade that used extortion as a tactic to try to force the hand of a Democratic president.CommentsLincoln MitchellHarriman Institute, Columbia UniversityBy refusing to continue to fund the U.S. government because of, essentially, losing a vote in Congress in 2010 and then an election in 2012, the Republican Party has made it clear getting their way is more important than anything else.CommentsJon SoltzCo-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranWe know who will be impacted by a shutdown by Republicans, and we know it will be bad. The degree to which it will be bad is what is up in the air. When it comes to troops and veterans, much of that holds true.Comments (88)Rep. Earl BlumenauerU.S. Representative from OregonOne of the cornerstones of my lifetime of public service has been to work on bipartisanship. But here in Congress, I must say it has been, under the Republican leadership, difficult, if not impossible.CommentsTom TarantinoChief Policy Officer, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of AmericaWhile veterans may be more protected than other constituencies, a government shutdown does not bode well for top priorities within the veterans\u0027 community.Comments (25)Jeff DanzigerPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideComments (16)Charles FergusonDirector, Wall Street documentary \u0027Inside Job\u0027; Author, \u0027Predator Nation\u0027I\u0027m cancelling my documentary about Hillary Clinton. It\u0027s a victory for the Clintons, and for the money machines that both political parties have now become. But I don\u0027t think that it\u0027s a victory for the media, or for the American people.Comments (1,181)Robert CreamerPolitical Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersLike the hero in a James Bond or Indiana Jones movie, Obamacare has faced new mortal threats at every turn. And like James Bond or Indiana Jones, each time it has emerged unscathed when the smoke of battle cleared.Comments (13)Literally, DarlingOnline magazine for twenty-something womenSometimes, you\u0027re going to hurt. Sometimes, you won\u0027t be able to handle it, and you feel like you need to hide it from your loved one. Don\u0027t.Comments (38)Sharon Salzberg and Robert ThurmanAnger is the wish to obliterate the target. It is the hot flash of destructive momentum that makes people lash out and, in too many cases, recklessly destroy lives, destroy the environment, destroy the very way of life of those perceived to be the enemy. In the Buddhist teachings, it is said that one moment of hatred against an enlightened being produces eons of negative effects, leading the hating person into a season in hell.Comments (27)Sara NelsonEditorial Director of Books and Kindle, Amazon.comWhile it may seem tame by today\u0027s standards, D.H. Lawrence\u0027s classic tale of a gamekeeper and a Lady was so outrageous on the topics of sex and class that it wasn\u0027t allowed to be published legally in this country until 1959, 30 years after it first surfaced in Europe.Comments (15)Jordan SchultzThe Huffington Post\u0027s sports columnist, The Schultz ReportDuring an NFL era of inflated offensive statistics and elite quarterbacking play, Drew Brees is on a level so dominant and special that it can almost be baffling to watch. The New Orleans Saints are not unlike most of the league in that they give a vast amount of responsibility to the quarterback. What Brees does from there though is beyond words.CommentsChristopher Molaro and Garrison HaningWe\u0027ve heard it said that reading is a lost art. And to say that it isn\u0027t is a hard case to make. Sure, America still reads. In fact, it is easier, now more than ever, to grab a quick dose of easily digestible writing for your personal edificationComments (15)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Giving in to bullies just encourages them to escalate their demands.The president gave in at the end of 2011 when Republican bullies threatened to go over the fiscal cliff and take the rest of the nation with them.Comments (913)Regina Weinreich, 2013. 1.10Jim Moore, 2013. 1.10Barry Lando, 2013. 1.10Ben de Guzman, 2013. 1.10Tracy Baim, 2013. 1.10Robin Raskin, 2013. 1.10John Feffer, 2013. 1.10Nathan Schneider, 2013. 1.10Tom Bartolomei, 2013. 1.10Shira Lazar, 2013. 1.10Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"COULD GO ON FOR WEEKS!
