{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoFaced with constitutional challenges to government actions, courts have two alternatives: they can uphold the law and allow it to be enforced or they can declare it invalid. When they uphold the law, they permit the majority to have their way; when they invalidate the law -- and exercise the power of judicial review -- they restrict the majority\u0027s freedom of action. The existence of judicial review matters only when the courts hold a law unconstitutional. A central question in evaluating this element of our constitutional structure is whether courts have exercised this authority wisely.It is, by now, a pretty well-worn topic that I don\u0027t think any of us particularly enjoy coming back to, but -- to bastardize Edmund Burke -- the only thing necessary for the triumph of stupid is for good men and women to do nothing.Jason LinkinsEditor, Eat the PressBefore women candidates can even begin to make their arguments and present their platforms, they must face frequent verbal attacks intended to take them down a peg or more -- merely for being women. Is it too much to hope that more people grow aware of just how female candidates\u0027 behaviors are marked?Kathleen ReardonProfessor, USC Marshall School; Author, \u0027The Secret Handshake\u0027 and \u0027Shadow Campus\u0027The 2016 presidential elections will address a range of issues, many of them irrelevant. Unless a major war has broken out by that point, Americans will focus on their own wallets. As such, the wisest candidates will focus on gross inequality. Piketty\u0027s book should be a wake-up call for politicians. If inequality sells in the stores, it will sell at the polls as well.John FefferCo-director, Foreign Policy In FocusNo Child Left Behind, \"school choice,\" \"recovery school districts,\" and Common Core are what the United States has done to solve the education \"crisis.\" Mind you, the \"crisis\" is that the United States is not number one in education.Shayna A.

No.Terry Burnham, Ph.D.Finance professor, Chapman UniversityThis system of destruction on a planetary scale, facilitated by most of the ruling and corporate elites on the planet, is becoming (to bring into play another category not usually used in connection with climate change) the ultimate \"crime against humanity\" and, in fact, against most living things. It is becoming a \"terracide.\"Tom EngelhardtEditor, TomDispatch.comThis is crazy stuff, and it makes it difficult if not impossible to have a reasonable discussion about the pros and cons of the Common Core.Diane RavitchResearch Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027What happened at the Phoenix VA is a real tragedy, and it deserves an investigation and a response. Without polling, I can tell you pretty much all of America\u0027s veterans believe that. But, what veterans don\u0027t seem to be saying yet, at least in the survey of our supporters, is that Eric Shinseki should resign.Jon SoltzCo-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranOur need to redefine success is as urgent on the collective level as it is in our personal lives. Limiting our metrics of success to money and power and completely defining ourselves by our jobs creates a political class obsessed with short-term gain -- one that\u0027s not up to the types of long-term challenges we\u0027re now facing.Arianna HuffingtonPsychological scientists Jeffry Simpson of the University of Minnesota and Nikola Overall of the University of Auckland have been working for some time on a dyadic model that they believe better illuminates how real couples deal with insecurity issues every day.Wray HerbertAuthor, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027Iggy Azalea is not a success story I wish to celebrate. To me, she isn\u0027t a success story at all: she is a novelty, a tiresome example of white female privilege and the delight white culture finds in white people appropriating any and everything.Olivia ColePoet, author, and activistAn Apple a day keeps the doctor away.

Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThe economic divide created by the dominance of the city\u0027s tech sector is a very real and thorny issue with no easy answers.Ryan ScottFounder and CEO, CausecastI am no fan of the TFA program. I do not believe that five or six weeks of training -- in a controlled environment, to boot -- is in any way sufficient to prepare you for the classroom.Mercedes SchneiderPublic school teacher, education activist, PhDWhen you are employed, looking for a new job is filled with dangers. You need to be careful your current employer doesn\u0027t discover that you are considering leaving. I call it a \"stealth job search.\"Susan P. JoyceOnline job search expert, Job - Hunt.org writerLBJ, who himself had struggled to afford school to become a teacher, had a finely tuned sense of human potential, of justice, and of what was possible with hard work and a good education.
