{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Just about nothing being proposed in mainstream politics is radical enough to fix what ails the economy. Restoring a more equal economy simply can\u0027t be done by raising incomes at the bottom, even with a minimum wage high that seemed inconceivable just months ago. It requires going after the grotesquely concentrated wealth and power at the top. But here\u0027s the rub: This isn\u0027t enough. Nothing in mainstream politics takes seriously the catastrophe of global climate change. Few mainstream politicians have the nerve to call for a carbon tax. The budget deadlock and the sequester mechanism make it impossible to invest the kind of money needed to finance a green transition. This is one of those moments when there is broad popular frustration, a moment when liberal goals require measures that seem radical by today\u0027s standards. If progressives don\u0027t articulate those frustrations and propose real solutions, rightwing populists will propose crackpot ones. Token gestures won\u0027t fool anybody.This week, President Obama has put a much-needed spotlight on the vicious cycle of mass incarceration.

Let there be no doubt, the planet will survive but whether we as a species will survive is another matter entirely.Author, The Evolution of a Revolution, www.lancesimmens.comTrump\u0027s whole agenda is provocation, which isn\u0027t to say he doesn\u0027t believe what he\u0027s saying. But he\u0027s also so over the top, so almost unbelievably bold, that he\u0027s become something of a parody of himself. And it feels as if he\u0027s fully in on the joke, which he may be. We could use a little provocation.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarDisconnecting forces your mind to process an event differently than if you\u0027re simply going to tweet it. It\u0027s hard to experience what\u0027s all around you when you\u0027re spending every moment with your eyes glued to a screen.Writing, Birding, Adventuring, LivingOne of the issues that most concerns me is whether African-American and white political leaders understand the significance of what occurred in Charleston, South Carolina.

There\u0027s absolutely no hint that the general public has shut down on Clinton in this vital area of public policy. But this won\u0027t stop the GOP from peddling that line.Author and political analystWith the conclusion of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) between the P5 1 and Iran, some are panicking in despair, while others have visions of a dramatically realigned Middle East. Both views are overreactions, since the deal itself is quite limited in scope, and the impact of 35 years of history and politics cannot easily be erased.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Pay attention to when you really come alive each day and use that window to do your most important work, not check email or surf the web. I can do those things half comatose, so I reserve them for my least energetic times just after waking up, right after lunch and just before bed.Founder, Riskology.coBorn in Wisconsin, and graduate of Marquette University\u0027s master\u0027s program in political science and international relations, you could say I had Green Bay in my DNA. And when Favre was traded to the Packers, it breathed life into a program that had only a single playoff win since I was born.Political science professor, LaGrange College in GeorgiaTo hear you say you love me and yet disagree with that is confusing.

She had over many months and in all reality a number of years been gradually changing her eating and exercise habits. I didn\u0027t want to see, I didn\u0027t want to name it.Author of Best Knickers Always: 50 Lessons for Midlife, life coach and speakerThe United Nations Security Council has scheduled a Monday vote to approve the Iran deal, giving it the force of international law and relegating opposition in the U.S. Congress to a secondary role. It is unclear what wwill happen next.
