The feminist says a woman should be president -- the trucker just laughs.Read Post | Comments (1,101)Al Gore, 03/11/13Chairman, Generation Investment Management and The Climate Reality ProjectThe level of inequality in the U.S. is already worse than in Egypt or Tunisia, two nations rocked in recent years by popular uprisings that overthrew national governments during the Arab Spring.Read Post | Comments (989)Kim Simon, 03/10/13Mother, Wife, Blogger, mamabythebay.comYou are 3.
