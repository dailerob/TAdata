{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Your dog\u0027s best friendLast week, marking the tenth anniversary of what Dr. Ray Seed once called \"the greatest man-made engineering catastrophe since Chernobyl,\" the circus came to town. No elephants, some clowns. Mainly foundation granters and thumb-sucking journos. Actually, there was an elephant, and they were the blind men. Perhaps the blindest was the walking TED Talk Malcolm Gladwell, who graced Meet the Press Sunday elaborating on his premise that \"we needed to destroy New Orleans to save it.\" The reed on which he rested was a study showing that previously-incarcerated young men who didn\u0027t return after evacuation were less likely, statistically, to be re-incarcerated than similar males who returned to the city. Self-deportation for offenders, anyone? Finally, Mitt Romney has a soulmate.We still have thirteen years to go before we reach John Maynard Keynes\u0027 prophetic year of leisure, but we\u0027re not exactly on the way to it. Americans are working harder than ever.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Obama has blocked all of Iran\u0027s pathways to a bomb. But more importantly, he has proven to America that security is better achieved through diplomacy than through militarism.President, National Iranian American CouncilResearch Director, National Iranian American CouncilSweet teachers: school just started, and I\u0027ll bet you\u0027re wiped out and definitely a little lighter in the bank account; but I see you. I see how hard you\u0027ve worked before the first day of school even started. I see that you chose this job not to get rich or famous.Founder, Women With WorthWe cannot be held hostage to the theatrics of religious extremists, nor should we allow them to think that supposedly bad \"optics\" will deter us in demanding our rights.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostSometimes, I just want to wake up from this nightmare. Is this really the country in which I want to raise my child? It is a country that I haven\u0027t known until now?Editor in Chief, HuffPost GermanyI can see in my mind\u0027s eye several of nurses, both female and male who have helped me heal. I have had it proven to me that nurses, a heck of a lot of them, really care about their jobs and their patients. And, I am glad so many caring men are among those doing the healing.Author, mom, blogger at http://jennykanevsky.comThere have been decades of decline and a parade of politicians promising help that never materialized. It\u0027s hard to believe in the future again after so much disappointment. On the other hand, the evidence of rebirth is overwhelming and economic optimism is necessary to make revitalization possible.Governor of New YorkOne beauty of the new global goals is that they set a common reference for debate. In the coming years, we will likely discover new roadblocks alongside opportunities to jump forward. These should prompt ongoing course corrections as the world veers toward success.Economist. Optimist. Senior Fellow at Brookings Institution and at UN Foundation; Fmr Manager \u0026 Deputy Director, UN Millennium ProjectIn the five days the nation spent grieving Alison and Adam\u0027s deaths, 440 other Americans died by guns. And yet, as a nation we do nothing, except watch the special interest gun industry get away with murder without any accountability while their NRA shills buy and intimidate cowardly members of Congress.President, Meredith ManagementThe global goals world leaders are agreeing to this month are not only for children living in poverty. The results they are trying to achieve will not only benefit people in need. They are universal goals -- reflecting universal rights, shared values and global challenges that affect every one of us.Executive Director, UNICEFWe will need new ways of thinking about old problems. It is not always necessary to develop expensive, brand new programs: it is possible to integrate behavioral insights into existing programs, making small, cost-effective modifications that can help reach people who are left behind by traditional programs.Senior Director, Poverty \u0026 Equity Global Practice, World Bank GroupSomewhere down where we don\u0027t like to go, is a place where racism lives. It\u0027s automatic and hidden. Binding and resistant to change. No matter how well-meaning we are, no matter how open-minded. Like the \"root kit\" on a computer, racism is hidden and operating without our knowledge.Clinical Psychologist \u0026 Founder, Sachs CenterI\u0027ve found, now, that my greatest strength has come from embracing the intensity of my emotions and understanding where they come from. I understand, not only my own pain but the obligation that I have to the patients we serve. We cannot abandon them like so many of the people in their lives.Founder, Friend, Daydreamer, Gal\u0027s Gal, Puppy EnthusiastIn Russia, thousands of government-funded clubs are producing what is called \"military-patriotic education\" for children. Accepting both boys and girls, these clubs teach them military exercises, some of which employ heavy military equipment.Professor of History emeritus, SUNY AlbanyI wanted to just whisper, please cherish that youth. Cherish it and celebrate it. Celebrate the true belief and comfort in watching your children grow, the ignorance of their own mortality.Just trying to complete this journey, but I keep losing my car keys and shoesTrump is often called \"crazy,\" but there is method to his madness, and that method is matched and displayed by the speaking style he employs on the stump. Even his detractors see that a large part of his appeal is that he comes across as unscripted.Davidson-Kahn Distinguished University Professor and Professor of Law at Florida International University; Floershimer Distinguished Visiting Professor of Law at Cardozo Law SchoolIn roughly the last 15 years, the same time period as the MDGs, we\u0027ve also seen the growth of the biggest advances in the fight against poverty, the power of good science. A year after a microloan program starts in a village, are the people there making more money than a similar village without the program? (Not as expected it turns out). Does giving cash grants which don\u0027t have to be repaid improve food security in Kenya? (Yes, significantly).Executive Director of Innovations for Poverty ActionIn my early campaigns people would sometimes come up to me at a grocery store or mall and say, \"I know you from somewhere. Is it the PTA? Do you live in my neighborhood?\" Always trying to be respectful, I would say, \"I don\u0027t think so, but maybe you saw me on TV. I\u0027m your county attorney.\"U.S. Senator from MinnesotaI need to highlight the issue that underlies this debate, and has fueled the decades of hostility towards trans women of all ages -- misogyny.Executive Director, Gender Rights MarylandBernie Sanders will become the Democratic nominee, primarily because people trust him and polls are finally beginning to reflect the energy and momentum of his campaign.Columnist published in The Cleveland Plain Dealer, The Baltimore Sun, The Hill, Salon, The Jerusalem Post www.hagoodman.comThe financial markets have been through some wild and crazy times over the last two weeks, although it appears that they have finally stabilized. The net effect of all the gyrations is that a serious bubble in China\u0027s market seems to have been at least partially deflated.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027For years I never even considered having children.

There are a lot more truths to that as well.Former Business Executive turned Life Coach who helps people discover their inner pearls to manifest their dreams!!!The problems in Fayetteville reflect what has been unfolding nationwide ever since the resurgence of heroin and the soaring use of prescription painkillers such as Percocet or Vicodin. Although these drugs have claimed thousands of lives in the U.S., healthcare resources and services have failed to catch-up to meet the demands for opiate treatment programs.Writer, overdose prevention specialist, videographerYou can\u0027t take a 2-year-old sightseeing all day, let him skip his nap, and then expect him to behave in a fancy restaurant.TravelandLeisure.comBe aware of your privilege as a man and don\u0027t use it to be a coward or a sucker by saying and doing things to take advantage. Be understanding, LISTEN to others. In every interaction, be humble and gentle and sincere.Poet, emcee, actorNever in a million years did I think I, of all people, would be nervous about turning 29. I mean, what\u0027s age, right? Nothing but a number. But the thoughts started piling up -- of the things I had done, that I hadn\u0027t finished, that I hadn\u0027t started.Writer, editor and runnerToday\u0027s global migration shift is not a new story in the Mediterranean. The controversy over unconditional birthrights dates back thousands of years.Author of forthcoming \"Damnatio Memoriae,\" www.jeffbiggers.comDemocrats are doing one of two things, and neither one of them is very impressive. Democratic candidates are either so scared of being called a tax-raiser by Republicans that they do not support changing the problem at all, or they are secretly for changing it but don\u0027t want to say it.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comInvesting in smallholder farmers not only helps eradicate the poverty in which they predominantly live; the benefits spill over into the health and wellbeing of the rest of the world\u0027s population.
