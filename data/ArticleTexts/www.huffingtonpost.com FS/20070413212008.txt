{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"APThis week gave us Karl Rove\u0027s missing email, Alberto Gonzales\u0027 subpoena, Larry Birkhead\u0027s victorious DNA, the Green Zone bombing of the Iraqi parliament, the death of Kurt Vonnegut, and the long overdue disgracing of Paul Wolfowitz (though, ironically, not because of his deceptions about the war but because of his deceptions about his mistress). But the story that really struck a nerve with our HuffPost bloggers was the Imus imbroglio. Don\u0027t miss the Imus takes of Alec Baldwin, Marty Kaplan, Bob Cesca, Ken Levine, Harry Shearer, Nina Burleigh, Gabriel Delahaye, Trey Ellis, Al Eisele, Patricia Zohn, Earl Ofari Hutchinson, Taylor Marsh, David Bromwich, Joseph A. Palermo, Rick Overton, Cenk Uygur, David Kuo, Michael Fauntroy, Etan Thomas, George Schlatter, Adam Hanft, and Barbara Ehrenreich.READ POST | comments04.14.2007 Richard CohenIt turns out all is not fair in love and war. Only war. Take a nation to war for spurious reasons and no one much complains. But arrange a raise for your girlfriend, and you get booed in the atrium of the World Bank.READ POST | comments (70)04.09.2007 Nora EphronYou can blame Bush/Cheney if you want; you can blame our justice system. But what about us? What are we doing about Guantanamo? Nothing. And why not? It\u0027s simple. We\u0027re too busy.READ POST | comments (159)04.10.2007 Sheryl CrowLaurie and I got up early to do CNBC. We were interviewed live, via earpiece, by a militant sceptic who\u0027s sole objective seemed to be to disprove us and the theory of global warming at every turn.READ POST | comments (64)04.12.2007 Bill MaherJohn McCain\u0027s not an idiot. I\u0027m sure he knows that it\u0027s not safe in Baghdad, but he has to pretend that it\u0027s safe in Baghdad because that\u0027s what the GOP base wants to hear.READ POST | comments (177)04.12.2007 Norman LearThis could be an historic, watershed moment if American leaders used this incident as a teaching moment, an opportunity to hold up a mirror to Americans everywhere and show them the truth of racism in our culture.READ POST | comments (79)04.10.2007 Christine LahtiWhen my daughter Emma was 10 years old, we marched together in Washington D.C. in \"The March For Women\u0027s Lives,\" and I watched her become a feminist.READ POST | comments (31)04.11.2007 Jon LandauIn America the accusation that someone is playing the \"race card\" is taken much more seriously than any charge of \"racism\" itself.READ POST | comments (159)04.13.2007 Chris KellyI was kind of hoping to never hear the phrase \"shock and awe\" again, but it\u0027s back in the news, because one of men who coined it is getting a reputation for paying for sex.READ POST | comments (54)04.13.2007 Gabriel DelahayeLuckily someone saved Rove\u0027s SMS text messages. 2001: can we move ovl offc to pentgon?

It shocks me that someone with your stature could know so little about global warming.READ POST | comments (90)04.12.2007 Arianna HuffingtonHarry Reid said this week that Bush is as isolated on Iraq as Nixon was during Watergate \"when he was hunkered down in the White House.\" If so, McCain is right there beside him, talking to the portraits of Lincoln and JFK.READ POST | comments (93)04.13.2007 Harry ShearerDon\u0027t waste all your schadenfreude on Imus. At the World Bank, Wolfowitz is pushing through promotions and raises for his squeeze while lecturing the poor countries of the world about corruption and good governance.READ POST | comments (37)Jane SmileyMax BlumenthalWill SchwalbeJohn KerryColleen WerthmannJohn RidleyAdam McKayJudy SwankMarty KaplanBob CescaStephen ElliottPaul RieckhoffTish DurkinJohn McQuaidVinod KhoslaAPAPAPAPAPDon Imus, radio and television \"shock jock,\" is under fire for calling a woman\u0027s basketball team \"nappy-headed hos.\"Today (April 5th) is CSS Naked Day.Seven devotees were nailed to crosses on Good Friday in a northern Philippine village. APAP/accesshollywood.comAPLogin to Huffington Post  |  Make Huff Post your Home Page  |  RSS/XML  |  Sitemap  |  Jobs  |  Contact UsCopyright 2007 © HuffingtonPost.com, Inc.   |  User Agreement  |  Privacy  |  Comment Policy  |  Powered by MovableType","h1":"Going, Going...",".title":"","h2":"Sunday RoundupWolfowitz: Mission Accomplished?What Did You Do In The War?Stop Global Warming College TourJohn McCain Fu**ed by the Republican Fantasy WorldImus and the Unending Coarsening of our CultureMy Daughter, My SisterImus\u0027 Words: Recognizing Real RacismChris Kelly: Shock and Ewww: Neocons and HookersKarl Rove\u0027s Secret Msgs REVEALED!
