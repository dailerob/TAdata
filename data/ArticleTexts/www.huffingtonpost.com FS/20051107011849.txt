{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"From whitehouse.govIn the wake of the Libby indictment, this week President Bush tried to change the subject to Alito and avian flu, while Harry Reid and the Senate Dems finally located their spines and kept the spotlight on Plamegate and the war. Check out some of this week\u0027s best blogs below, as well as Jane Hamsher, Jeralyn Merritt, Stephen Kaus and Alan Gerson on Plamegate, Flavia Colgan and Bill Scher facing off on Alito, and Patt Morrison learning to love the bird flu. Plus don\u0027t miss the latest satiric offerings from Danielle Crittenden and Jerry and Joe Long.READ POST | comments (18)10.31.2005 Nora EphronWhat\u0027s wrong with the president? Is he fighting depression? Is he being medicated in some way that isn\u0027t quite working? What\u0027s up?READ POST | comments (205)10.31.2005 Arthur Schlesinger Jr.Maybe Hillary should go to Iraq, as Ike went to Korea, and take along General Wes Clark -- a possible dream ticket for 2008.READ POST | comments (92)10.31.2005 Alec BaldwinCheney, Rumsfeld, these people were built for war. They are haters. They are destroyers. They have no skills whatsoever except utilizing defense policy to manipulate the Dow.READ POST | comments (143)10.31.2005 Ari EmanuelExactly what kind of subliminal message was the president trying to send by introducing Alito not in the Oval Office, as he did with Harriet Miers, but in the Cross Hall, a part of the White House no one has seen before?READ POST | comments (13)11.05.2005 Marty KaplanThere\u0027s a word for holding fast to a belief despite the evidence: fundamentalism. Is a faith-based foreign policy cult really the best we can do?READ POST | comments (20)11.02.2005 Gary HartThe religious right in America, empowered by compliant elected officials, some of whom are intimidated by that element, is seeking a dictatorship of the minority.READ POST | comments (91)11.04.2005 Alan DershowitzIf Fitzgerald does not have the authority to disclose classified material, then he is a Potemkin prosecutor, not an independent one.READ POST | comments (111)11.01.2005 Seth GreenlandIn a publicity coup even Bill Clinton would envy, Scooter Libby has placed himself squarely on the literary map. Last week, the world had no idea he had written a novel.READ POST | comments11.03.2005 Nathan GardelsIt would be a big mistake to let the White House and its allies frame the issue as \"faulty intelligence\" in which the whole world believed -- the \"we were all wrong\" argument.READ POST | comments (73)11.03.2005 Arianna HuffingtonCan somebody please, please, please shut Carville up--especially about Plamegate. His takes on the scandal are utterly compromised by his marriage to Mary Matalin.READ POST | comments (236)11.04.2005 Carol Platt LiebauThe Democrats\u0027 ultimate aim is to drive support for the war on terror so low that we lose it. Just like Vietnam.READ POST | comments (169)11.02.2005 Harry ShearerCoverage of Rosa Parks\u0027 funeral, second-day reaction to the Alito nomination--what else will drown out the story of the Senate Homeland Security Committe hearing today?READ POST | comments (36)11.04.2005 Larry BeinhartIf it is Mr. Bush\u0027s war, not America\u0027s, it is patriotic to end it. If he conned us into it, then there is no dishonor in repudiating it.READ POST | comments (49)11.02.2005 Laurie DavidWe\u0027ve all seen what Oprah can do for book sales -- now we\u0027re about to find out what she can do for light bulbs.READ POST | comments (51)11.02.2005 Kenneth LererLet\u0027s see if Scooter has the same public relations consultants as Tom DeLay.READ POST | comments (37)11.01.2005 Michael SmerconishI was really asking whether Matthews could corroborate Russert’s side of the conversation.
