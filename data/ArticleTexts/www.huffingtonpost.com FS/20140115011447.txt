{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Craig AaronPresident and CEO, Free PressThe big news: A federal appeals court on Tuesday struck down the Federal Communications Commission\u0027s Open Internet Order. This decision means that companies like AT\u0026T, Comcast and Verizon -- which brought the lawsuit -- are now free to block or slow down any website, application or service they like. These companies will rush to change the Web and line their own pockets at our expense -- creating new tolls for app makers, expensive price tiers for popular sites, and fast lanes open only to the few content providers that can afford them. The rules the court struck down left much to be desired, but they were a step toward preserving Internet users\u0027 freedom to go wherever they wanted, whenever they wanted. It didn\u0027t have to be this way.Comments (19)Dennis PowersInternet technologistI am the new working poor. The \"better life\" that my parents worked so hard to make for me, that I worked so hard to improve, had come down to this decision: whether to purchase food for my belly or the medication to prevent another stroke.Comments (369)Manoj Jain, MD MPHPhysician and WriterWe don\u0027t think of flu as a life-threatening illness in otherwise healthy young or middle-age adults, yet it is. In a bad flu season, as many as 50,000 deaths may occur due to flu-related illnesses.CommentsJakob von UexkullFounder, World Future CouncilWe are failing to use all the productive resources available to us and, as a result, over 200 million people are unemployed around the world. On the other hand, we live beyond our natural limits because we use more natural and finite resources than is sustainable. A huge opportunity thus presents itself.CommentsArianna HuffingtonAnimals help us be better humans. Quite often, they show us how to be our best selves. Always in the moment, sticking their noses into everything (literally), they see a world that we take for granted, one we\u0027re usually just hurriedly passing through on our way to lives we never quite reach.Comments (23)Jeff JarvisAuthor, \u0027Public Parts\u0027 and \u0027What Would Google Do?\u0027Imagine a world in which there is no stigma about illness, in which ailments are not a matter of privacy or lost insurance or jobs, in which we collectively share and learn as much as we can about what afflicts us so it can afflict fewer. It\u0027s just data.CommentsKatie HeaneyPeople have interesting reactions when you tell them you\u0027ve never had a boyfriend and you\u0027re over the age of 21. Most girls are pretty good at acting like they aren\u0027t shocked, because most of them have at least one friend who doesn\u0027t date as much as the others for whom they\u0027ve learned to be uncondescendingly empathetic.Comments (72)Eric BoehlertSenior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaDespite the hundreds of hours Republican congressional committees have spent trying to ferret out Obama scandals, and the thousands of hours the right-wing media have devoted to that same goal since 2009, Christie\u0027s office last week produced the type of smoking-gun document that Obama\u0027s critics can still only dream about. But of course they\u0027ll keep dreaming.CommentsEric WaggonerChair, English department, West Virginia Wesleyan CollegeTo hell with you all for continuing to exploit the lax, poorly-enforced safety regulations here, so that you could do your business in the cheapest manner possible by shortcutting the health and quality of life not only of your workers, but of everybody who lives here.CommentsMichael ShawPublisher of the visual politics and media literacy site, BagNewsNotesPerhaps the invisibility of this story has to do with Western media\u0027s unspoken criteria for foreign news and, especially, photos.CommentsNell MinowCo-founder, GMI Ratings; Movie criticWe\u0027d like to think that nominees could give the prospect of giving thanks a fraction of the thought they give their red carpet look. Why are awards acceptance speeches so terrible?CommentsArt BrodskyCommunications consultant, proprietor of Continental Drive blogThe idea that those companies that run big telecommunications networks shouldn\u0027t be able to play favorites is dead, at age 80. First enacted in the 1934 Communications Act, the principle was very simple. Telephone companies shouldn\u0027t be able to discriminate among the traffic they carry. The U.S. Appeals Court for the D.C. Circuit ruling killed it.CommentsJeremiah GoulkaWriter\"Redskins\" is an offensive term and therefore inappropriate for the team representing our nation\u0027s capital. That\u0027s kind of obvious, right? Most Republicans don\u0027t think so. For one thing, Republicans tend to wear a set of blinders, crafted and actively maintained by the party\u0027s functionaries and its media priesthood.Comments (14)Tavis SmileyPBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorAbdi\u0027s debut screen appearance garnered him a Golden Globe nomination. Nyong\u0027o has won numerous honors for her feature acting debut as Patsey in the critically acclaimed film, 12 Years a Slave, including SAG and Golden Globe nominations.CommentsRichard (RJ) EskowSenior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host, Take Action NewsDemocrats have been pleading with President Obama not to cut Social Security for years. Until now, most of the public pleas have come from Democratic voters. Now they\u0027re coming from Democratic senators.Comments (15)Terry O\u0027NeillPresident, National Organization for WomenHow long do we have to wait for the wage gap between men and women to be closed? Data from the Institute for Women\u0027s Policy Research estimate that at the current pace, it won\u0027t be until the year 2058! That\u0027s unacceptable, of course. So what can we do?CommentsMatt IngebretsonWriter and comedian\"Breathtaking... a profound work of subtlety. Bravely written and sent. A must respond text.\" -Entertainment WeeklyCommentsAlden WickerFreelance journalist and blogger on the sustainable lifestyle in New York City.When my aunt goes out to buy freshly-made croissants, I didn\u0027t sniff them and ask, with disdain, if they are organic. I eat a freakin\u0027 croissant because she bought them for me out of love.CommentsLisa Bonchek AdamsLiving with metastatic cancer; Writer, www.lisabadams.comHow I handle metastatic cancer matters. \"Doing it right\" doesn\u0027t mean I have to be positive all the time. But it means I have to be honest.CommentsCarl Cecereappellate lawyer, constitutional thinker, owner, Cecere PCA case being argued at the United States Supreme Court next week, NLRB v. Noel Canning, threatens to do away with the chief executive\u0027s ability to use recess appointments to deal with senatorial stonewalling.Comments (27)Adam GrantWharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027Every year, some of my students receive the worst good news that can come during a job search. \"We\u0027d like to hire you,\" the recruiter begins, \"but we need a decision very quickly.\"CommentsRev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkWhile the investigation continues, subpoenas get issued and details hashed out, one thing has become abundantly clear: the residents of Fort Lee and the people of New Jersey were treated as some sort of an afterthought.CommentsJade BeallWorld-renowned photographerThe truth of the matter is nobody should feel shameful for feeding her baby. And, dare I say, it is also OK to feel beautiful and breastfeed at the same time.Comments (32)Brian Levin, J.D.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityFederal investigators may reenter the case of Kelly Thomas, 37, a mentally ill homeless man, who died following a violent 2011 videotaped confrontation with police, after two former Fullerton, CA officers were acquitted on all state charges late Monday.CommentsNancy HuehnergarthPresident, Nancy F. Huehnergarth ConsultingWhat else is Big Soda doing to quash consumer water consumption, and damage the First Lady\u0027s Drink Up campaign, that we have yet to discover?Comments (54)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and author14 hospitals in the United States are charging more than ten times their costs for treatment. Specifically, for every $100 one of these hospitals spends, the charge on the corresponding bill is nearly $1,200.Comments (73)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027With national health care costs running close to $3 trillion a year, if U.S. costs could be brought in line with costs in other wealthy countries the potential savings would be on the order of $1.5 trillion a year. Those savings could provide a lot of health care for people in the United States and around the world.Comments (13)Christine PelosiChair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusNot even the Teflon fleece can save him now: the hypocrisy of pretending to be a man of the people and using the government to hurt the people will spell the end of Chris Christie\u0027s presidential chances.Comments (48)Michael Shtender-Auerbach and Markus E. BouillonSec. of State Kerry is certainly aware of the history and histrionics of the peace process, as well as the risks of failure, and his persistence despite seeming intransigence underscores the potentially grave consequences of walking away.Comments (25)Wait But Whywww.waitbutwhy.comBeware of what I call the \"Name Fad.\" Sure, it sounds hip now, but in 30 years, the names Natalie, Chelsea, Samantha, and Lindsay will sound how Nancy, Cheryl, Susan, and Linda do today. And in 60 years, the names Ethan, Cody, Brandon, and Matthew will be Earl, Chester, Bernard, and Melvin. These are all just Name Fads -- only difference is when they happened.Comments (57)William McNultyCo-founder, Team RubiconToday, PTSD is better understood and treated than it has ever been. Why, then, is suicide so much more prevalent in young men and women who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan when compared with the general population?CommentsBill Quigley, 2014.14.01Steven Raichlen, 2014.14.01Dr. Marcia Ishii-Eiteman, 2014.14.01Monica Edinger, 2014.14.01Eric Waggoner, 2014.14.01Edward Goldman, 2014.14.01Dan Solin, 2014.14.01Dana Beyer, 2014.14.01Felice Shapiro, 2014.14.01Tom Krattenmaker, 2014.14.01Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"JERSEY JIVE",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BizYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
