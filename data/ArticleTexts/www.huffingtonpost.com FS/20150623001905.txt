{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Thanks to a last-minute deal last Thursday between President Obama and the Republican leadership in Congress, the fast-track bill is still alive. Its passage depends on whether a handful of Senate Democrats can be persuaded to go along. If there is a grand bargain to be had on a trade deal, it should go something like this: Globalization should be used to increase, not depress, labor and environmental standards. For starters, one key nation that fails to enforce the right of its workers to organize or join unions should be compelled to do so. That would be the United States of America. Before Democrats entertain any more corporate wish lists, let\u0027s see what corporate America is offering in return. Trade adjustment assistance doesn\u0027t do it. A few Democrats may vote for the deal because they naively think TAA is a defensible trade-off. Most who hide behind this scanty fig leaf know exactly what they are doing.Ever since I can remember, my dad would write us a morning note. Before he left to catch the 5am train to the city, he always took the time to write good luck in that game or on that test, or to draw a stick figure reenactment of the game we had watched the previous night.Ever since the Seattle Seahawks\u0027 victory in Super Bowl XLVIII put a national spotlight on the benefits of performance-enhancing practices including yoga, mindfulness and sleep, I\u0027ve wanted to learn more about how the team has made sleep a part of its culture. So I contacted head coach Pete Carroll, who connected me with Sam Ramsden and Michael Gervais, who lead the Seahawks\u0027 sports science team.It\u0027s hardly a surprise that Republican congressional leaders and their cadre of Democratic allies spurred on by Barack Obama are resorting to a bagful of parliamentary tricks to put the Trans-Pacific Partnership on a \"take it or leave it but you can\u0027t change it\" fast-track to enactment by Tuesday.Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyHistorian; Author, \u0027The LaFollettes of Wisconsin: Love and Politics in Progressive America\u0027So long as the ubiquity of conflict situations conducive to violence is the hallmark of international relations, attempts to delimit and to limit violent acts of any type will have only partial, transitory success.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghOK, I can\u0027t resist sending out at least one photo from Greece today... This is a picture I took in a forest full of Plane Trees, in a river valley in the beautiful mountain region of Zagorohoria.Bestselling authorNo one is more vested in seeking justice than the courageous family members of those nine innocent victims who were slaughtered in a place that was their sanctuary. Anyone who thinks that forgiving Dylann Roof is an act of weakness has no clue what forgiveness is all about, nor what kind of inner strength it takes to do such a thing.President, National Action NetworkIf reporting about Dylann Roof will lead to some good solutions to real problems, we should keep going. But if it runs the risk of creating copycats, we need to report but not over-report.Host, Fox News\u0027 \u0027On the Record With Greta Van Susteren\u0027I\u0027ve noticed on my social network feeds that many of my white sisters and brothers reply #AllLivesMatter. Yes, yes they do. But do my white sisters and brothers realize that in this very moment these microaggressions are like another death by a thousand Facebook posts?Pastor of Christ Church: Portland, an open, active \u0026 inclusive faith community for God\u0027s glory \u0026 neighbor\u0027s good.I can\u0027t in good conscience, feminist and otherwise, continue watching a show that is so blatant -- so over the top -- in its sexism and misogyny and makes no apologies for it. As a human being, I agree with Tyrion Lannister: \"There\u0027s always been enough death in the world for my taste: I can do without it in my leisure time.\"Author of \"American Monsters\" and upcoming \"Crime Rave\"Once black issues stop being black issues, once Latino issues stop being Latino issues -- when they\u0027re just issues -- that\u0027s we have something. I preach to everyone, go outside your demographic and join their struggle. Even if it\u0027s not at your front door. Show them you\u0027re there.Performer, hoarder of books, coffee addict and librarian in trainingMoney is an illusion. You think you need so much. In the end, you don\u0027t really need any of it. Prioritize people and experiences over possession. Your body is just a vessel for your soul. Quit looking in the mirror. Quit obsessing over your wrinkles, your ass, your dress size.Feminist, body positive, wife, mom of five, Editor In Chief at ravishly.com, (sometimes) RN.Again and again the upcoming election you\u0027ll hear conservatives claim that Medicare -- the health insurance program for America\u0027s seniors -- is running out of money and must be pared back. Baloney.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027People often ask me whether being President has made it more difficult to spend time with Michelle and our girls. But the surprising truth is that being in the White House has made our family life more \"normal\" than it\u0027s ever been.44th President of the United StatesThat so many states are taking this issue seriously is tremendous progress. It is crucial, however, to ensure that the laws being passed truly protect victims and that they are clear, principled, and constitutionally sound. Unfortunately, many of these state laws do not fulfill these criteria.Professor of Law, University of Miami School of Law; Legislative \u0026 Tech Policy Director, Cyber Civil Rights InitiativeEvery time there\u0027s a mass shooting, it ignites the debate about whether guns make us more or less safe. And even though the NRA has been surprisingly silent since the Charleston massacre, they have plenty of surrogates running the virtues of the \u0027armed citizen\u0027 up the rhetorical flagpoleMike the Gun GuyAs South Carolina Republican Governor Nikki Haley moves toward a plan to remove the Confederate Battle Flag from the State House grounds, it\u0027s worth remembering another debate nearly a decade ago in Georgia, which could foreshadow the coming firestorm in the Palmetto State.Political science professor, LaGrange College in GeorgiaAmerican workers and American manufacturers don\u0027t oppose trade. They can compete on a level playing field with anyone in the world. But the current trade regime, swept in without serious analysis on the back of Fast Track authority, has failed to provide a level playing field.International President, United SteelworkersGrowing up, I didn\u0027t really understand what it meant to take the road less traveled. I used to be so trapped in who I was that I didn\u0027t bother to look around me. But everything came to a sudden halt when my grandmother passed away. For the first time in my life, I really questioned what the purpose of everything was.Associate Editor, Blogs \u0026 CommunityThe 10,000-steps-a-day recommendation has nothing to do with sedentary, fast-food-drenched circa-2015 America. Rather, the recommendation first popped up in a very different food and environment: 1960s Japan.“Science of Us” is a smart but playful window into the latest science on human behavior.As we fight our way back from the recession, it\u0027s clear that our economy isn\u0027t working for everyone. Too many don\u0027t have the skills they need for the jobs available. As a union, the AFT takes on these issues. This work isn\u0027t loud or provocative, but it\u0027s vital for our communities and our nation.President, American Federation of TeachersThe discovery of an apparent online manifesto shows Dylann Roof describing his path to embracing white supremacy. Where have we heard before that the death of Trayvon Martin was justified and blacks are nothing but thugs and criminals? On right-wing websites like WorldNetDaily.Founder and Editor, ConWebWatch.com; former senior editor, Media MattersI know Jon Stewart has always been adamant that he\u0027s a fake journalist, not a real one, so I\u0027m sure he\u0027ll like even less what these final shows leave me wanting to call him. Teacher.USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorMichael Donald was 19 on the night of March 21, 1981, when two men affiliated with the Ku Klux Klan took him at gunpoint from a street in Mobile, Alabama. They carried him to a secluded place, beat him, strangled him, and cut his throat.Political consultant, writer, Political Partner of the Truman National Security Project, Global Fellow of PS21No matter how much their fathers may have disappointed or hurt them, all the women I met felt a measure of loyalty and gratitude to them. Fathers matter a great deal not only in childhood but well into adulthood -- and yet few women are truly aware of the ways in which their fathers impact them.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarIf the U.S. Federal Reserve is concerned about the state of dental care in this country, you know we have a problem. In fact, according to the Fed, we have a very big problem.Author, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgI\u0027ll be over here, subsisting on soup and plain bread until the sugar shakes go away.Everything worth caring about in food, drink, and travelLike so many Americans, Fox News has been reeling in the wake of the massacre, except reeling in a different way. While Americans recoiled from the raw hate behind the gun rampage, Fox News wrestled with bouts of pathological denial.Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaMost of us are silent as one more senseless mass shooting traumatizes a community, this time in South Carolina. I am sick and tired of silence. Silence is killing us. Who is ultimately responsible for dozens of gun lobby sponsored bills advancing each year in conservative legislatures? We are.Missouri State RepresentativeThe Plains Spill is yet another tragic reminder that oil spills happen and will continue to happen as long as we depend on fossil fuels for our energy needs. Until we can move beyond oil, we must do everything we can to ensure safety -- not profit -- remains our number one priority. Our economy and our environment depend on it.U.S. Representative for California\u0027s 24th DistrictThe summer after my first year of teaching was a relief. And a surprise.
