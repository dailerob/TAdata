{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"It\u0027s been 10 years since The Huffington Post was born, on May 9, 2005. We\u0027ve done a lot of reminiscing during our anniversary week, but our real focus is on looking ahead. That\u0027s why the theme for our 10-year anniversary is \"The Next 10.\" To celebrate this milestone, we\u0027re rolling out a range of special projects, launches and events -- the high and the low, the serious and the playful -- and all of them have something to say about where we\u0027re coming from and especially where we\u0027re going. I\u0027m grateful to everyone who has been a part of HuffPost from Day 1. And I\u0027m especially grateful to everyone who has read, viewed and shared what we\u0027re doing on HuffPost. We are here because of you.Wall Street cannot be an island onto itself and we need to break up those largest banks to put the focus back on working class Americans.Independent U.S. Senator from VermontOver time we\u0027ve seen significant growth in the \"working poor\" -- people working full time, sometimes even 60 or more hours each week, but at such low wages that they remain impoverished. What to do?Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027I want my children, Max and Summer, to always appreciate what they have, but also to understand they have a role in helping our fellow citizens around the world to the basic need of food. I\u0027d love for them to stumble upon this article and other hunger relief stories a decade from now and see that there is an end to world hunger.Performer, mom and global hunger relief advocateThe next decade is decisive because trajectory counts for so much; if we bend it now, we may slide the car to a halt with just the front tires hanging off the cliff. But if we sail on for a few more years, it\u0027s pretty clear we\u0027re fast and furiously going airborne -- that\u0027s what happens when, say, Arctic permafrost starts to melt in earnest, releasing clouds of methane.Author of a dozen books, including \u0027The End of Nature\u0027 and \u0027Deep Economy\u0027NEW YORK -- A decade from now, the hearts of some of our largest cities will no longer be defined by gleaming skyscrapers surrounded by well-manicured corporate plazas. The city will regain its human scale and emerge once again as a series of communities -- completing a fascinating journey back to the future.Milstein Professor of Urban Development, Columbia UniversityHow about we pause, put down our devices, look up and listen to our hearts and our consciences? Not so much \u0027connectivity\u0027 as just connecting with each other. And if that moral progress could keep pace with technological progress then that would be, well, real progress.Hashemite Kingdom of JordanCEOs and other business leaders have to stand up for all of their stakeholders -- employees, customers, partners, shareholders and local communities -- and recognize that they are part of a larger ecosystem. Issues ranging from climate change and global health to food production and education impact every business.Chairman and CEO of SalesforceThe state of race, culture and religion in America is a key metric for how we are evolving as a society. The question for the church in 2025 is do we have enough elasticity and self-awareness to accommodate other customs, and views different from our own?Senior Pastor, Potter\u0027s House, TexasIn the next 10 years, we believe that computers will move beyond their current role as our assistants, and become our advisors. With their help, we\u0027ll grapple with and solve some of the toughest issues facing the world today.Executive chairman of GoogleDirector of Google Ideas \u0026 Advisor to the Executive Chairman of GoogleIt\u0027s unnerving how teams can make business and sport decisions on your body while you\u0027re not given the same grace to make the best choices for your own career. Maybe in 10 years the business of football will be equally regarded on all sides.6-year NFL veteran, screenwriter, creatorAll editors, unburdened of the Sisyphean task of maintaining newsstand sales, could try more interesting, less available people -- a commodity as scarce as actual covers themselves.Chief creative officer, co-president of Entertainment Group, Guggenheim MediaOn Monday night we celebrated HuffPost\u0027s 10-year anniversary with a party at the Gramercy Park Hotel in New York City. And since HuffPost and Goldman Sachs have partnered for nearly three years to spotlight solutions around the world, we had a conversation about what we\u0027ve learned and what\u0027s in store for the next 10 years. Here is a lightly edited transcription of our conversation.Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.The media of the future is nimble, fit, and intimate. It has no respect for its elders. It doesn\u0027t care how it was done before. There is a very real power in realizing this. Those who cling on to power are most likely to lose it.Founder and owner, TheBlazeTechnology affords us a new hope. With the advent of the iPhone we\u0027re in a national state of shock regarding the incredibly destructive \"shoot first\" culture of many police departments. This shock could lead to major reform that could uplift and save so many lives.Writer-Director, How To Make Money Selling DrugsProducer, How To Make Money Selling DrugsI remain optimistic that one day we will see a world where leaders look beyond the next electoral cycle or the next shareholder meeting. Where we collectively realize that we do not live in a zero-sum world where someone\u0027s gain automatically comes at another\u0027s expense.Chair of the Kofi Annan Foundation and The EldersIn 2025, in accordance with Moore\u0027s law, we will see an acceleration in the rate of change as we move closer to a world of true abundance. Here are eight areas where we\u0027ll see extraordinary transformation in the next decade.Chairman/CEO, XPRIZEGiven the way our brain is wired, we believe we can divine how other people think.Author, Political Animals: How Our Stone Age Brain Gets in the Way of Smart PoliticsYes, Nike, a company that grew to be worth billions by outsourcing jobs to overseas sweatshops, a company that sets up P.O.-box subsidiaries in tax havens to avoid paying U.S. taxes, a company that uses threats to extort tax breaks from its \"home\" state. Is this really the sort of company Obama wants to use as the face of what the TPP will bring?Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureFor the last 15 years I\u0027ve dedicated my life to ending our country\u0027s disastrous war on drugs. It has been an incredible journey, and I am happy to say that seeds that were planted a long time ago are finally bearing some fruit.Director of Media Relations, Drug Policy AllianceEight Hundred years ago in June, King John of England signed Magna Carta, a word most English speaking peoples recognise, but what actually was it?Author and Historian; author of the acclaimed Anjou Trilogy and frequent lecturer and historical writer.Through it all, I have cared deeply -- okay, some might say fiercely! -- about the health of our planet. Most everything I do, as a parent or advocate, circles around the environment.Environmental activist, Mother, Former modelSupporting Sanders for the Democratic nomination is sort of like ordering a new-fangled As-Seen-On-TV exercise contraption. Making a conscious decision to get into better shape is admirable. However, there are about 10,000 subsequent steps that need to occur after handing over your credit card number.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027Women do not benefit in anywhere near equal measure from the Greek system, and they pay a high price being part of it. An estimated 40 percent of women in sororities report rape or attempted rape, much higher than those who are not in sororities.Feminist, writer, and satirist (not always in that order)It would be a huge mistake for Democrats to dismiss the newfound economic populism of Republican presidential candidates as obviously laughable given Republicans\u0027 deep alliance with corporate America. Republicans are aiming to pull off a populist jiu-jitsu, using anger at corporate influence over government to justify even more dismantling of government. It could work.Senior Fellow, Roosevelt Institute; author of \u0027Fighting for Our Health\u0027Last week was startling -- but confusing -- on the energy/water nexus innovation front.Former executive director and chairman, Sierra ClubI will never stop missing him. I will never stop thinking about him. I will try to remember how he smelled like the Irish Spring soap he showered with, how his long toes looked more like fingers, and I will always remember how our time together was filled with lots of laughter and affection.Mom, widow, screenwriter, author, slow-eater, fast walkerThe past, especially the political past, doesn\u0027t just provide clues to the present. In the realm of the presidency and Wall Street, it provides an ongoing pathway for political-financial relationships and policies that remain a threat to the American economy going forward.Distinguished Senior Fellow, DemosThere will be real discussion about real issues, because Sanders will, as he always has, yell and prod and poke until he gets an answer. Maybe through those very discussions we\u0027ll see some of the best solutions to our biggest issues appear.Richard Zombeck is a freelance writer for hire and a contributor to www.nowitcounts.comThose of us in the deception detection community spotted Tom Brady\u0027s deceptive behavior early on -- he was leaking verbal and non-verbal tells throughout his press conference.Founder and CEO, CalibrateMore than 30% of identity theft cases involve a family member or close friend.
