And that the effects of air campaigns diminish over time -- as the Germans discovered when their intense bombing of London in 1940 failed to break Britain\u0027s will. Shock and awe are short-lived.To make personal changes is to do too little. Only great movements, only collective action can save us now.

The time to head off a wider war is now.Director, Arms and Security Project, Center for International PolicyThe government refuses to accede to terrorist demands for money or the release of prisoners, arguing that doing so creates a perverse incentive that would encourage more kidnapping.Training a new generation of international correspondents in the digital ageObama officials used to be fond of saying that, in Afghanistan, \"we will know success when we see it.\" So, too, with IS. Unfortunately, our angle of vision may be a supine one.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghProfessional sports have been given a zone of immunity from the normal social, political and economic constraints that apply to the rest of us.

It is actually driven by it.Author, Colliding Worlds: How Cutting-Edge Science is Redefining Contemporary ArtThese stories do not end with \"...and they live happily ever after.\" Instead, they often end in death -- as life does -- or in an ambiguous place that does not grant a tidy moral.Author, \u0027In the Red\u0027The People\u0027s Climate March on September 21st will be a turning point for the climate movement.
