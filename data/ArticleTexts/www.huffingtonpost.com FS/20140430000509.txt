{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Mark GongloffChief financial writer, The Huffington PostIn these days of political strife, of Cruz v. Warren, Bush v. Clinton, Sterling v. Humanity, it is nice to know that at least one thing can still bring us together to hold hands and eat casserole: Hating banks. In fact, one of the most radical anti-bank schemes you\u0027re ever going to see comes from a conservative economist, John Cochrane of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, who is also affiliated with the Hoover Institution and the Cato Institute, two conservative think tanks. In a recent paper, \"Toward a run-free financial system,\" Cochrane proposes a dramatic change in the way banks do business, forcing them to back every single thing they do, every loan they make, every bond they sell, with either some kind of stock or relatively safe Treasury debt. Such a plan would certainly end banking as we know it, and might end our need to worry about a huge bank collapsing and setting all of our money on fire.Being stuck on a Donald Sterling, a George Zimmerman, is an easy and convenient way not to deal with the real problem of power and power structures run amok, that allow these sorts of ugly things to happen over and over again.Kevin PowellPublic speaker and activist; author, \u0027Barack Obama, Ronald Reagan, and the Ghost of Dr. King: Blogs and Essays\u0027It has everything to do with Obama Derangement Syndrome -- Republican governors who refuse for a variety of cheap political excuses to attach their names to Obamacare. By doing so, they\u0027re hurting their own people, including Republican voters by numbers into the hundreds of thousands per state.Bob CescaManaging Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowAn economy with nobody working is boring. The share of the population that is working simply has not recovered.Douglas Holtz-EakinPresident, American Action ForumI think that I should be able to wear whatever the hell I want without being labeled as a slut. This idea that men cannot control their impulses is archaic and offensive.Belle KnoxDuke porn star; sex-positive feminist; activist for sex-worker rightsBasketball is an international messenger of America and the values it represents. For young people everywhere, including the disadvantaged and people of color around the world, basketball courts, both figuratively and literally have been an accessible space where achievement, physical grace and sportspersonship can flourish.Brian Levin, J.D.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityWe might not be in the back of the bus, and we might not drink from separate water fountains, but racial discrimination is very much alive in 2014. Anyone who ever doubted that reality can look at the events of the past week.Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkI was a first year student out at a party drinking in the Fall, and a guy who insisted on walking me home invited me to hang out in his room. It\u0027s not unusual -- practically commonplace.Emily RendaUVA Student; External Chair, Sexual Assault Leadership CouncilYou could argue that the woman on the recording didn\u0027t really set up the man on the recording; instead, she let events play out in a way that seemed quite characteristic for the Clippers owner.Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarI find it concerning that Rutgers University would choose to utilize an occasion that is intended to set its students forward on a path of both honesty and integrity to celebrate an individual with such a disturbing track record.Sami H. ElmansouryExecutive at Precision Learning; owner of blog \"American Reflections\"; writer; public speakerNot only have they been overpaid relative to the damage their sector has caused, but many of them and their institutions have been made whole at the taxpayers\u0027 expense once the depressed risk pricing was revealed and the bubble burst.Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorIf you don\u0027t feel ready to take the leap quite yet, you shouldn\u0027t judge yourself either. I sure don\u0027t.Akirah RobinsonBreakup Coach and WriterThe strategy of Venezuela\u0027s extreme right is to make the country ungovernable, so as to gain by force what they have been unable to win in 18 elections over the past 15 years.Mark WeisbrotCo-director, Center for Economic and Policy Research, Washington, D.C.Yes, there are a few, such as Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates, who made it big. But they are the outliers -- and they too don\u0027t fit the stereotype. Here are six myths about what it actually takes to make it.Vivek WadhwaAcademic, Researcher, Writer, EntrepreneurIn six weeks, America\u0027s campaign to kill Jalaluddin Haqqani had resulted in 159 dead civilians, a flattened village, 37 destroyed homes, a fractured tribal leadership, and the ascendancy of one man, Pacha Khan Zadran, as the most important player in Loya Paktia.Anand GopalIf admissions officers do not see the value in a test that is better aligned with the Common Core and continue to assign equal weight to both tests, the new SAT will be in a precarious position as students migrate in droves to the ACT.Jed ApplerouthTeacher, speaker and an educational innovatorSo, how seriously should we take the movie\u0027s premise -- that superhuman AI is a potential threat to humanity? And how plausible, from a scientific viewpoint, is the sequence of events leading to Caster\u0027s mind being reconstituted, in vastly magnified form, inside a quantum computer?Stuart RussellComputer science professor at Berkeley; Co-author, \u0027Artificial Intelligence: a Modern Approach\u0027I had no idea the video would touch so many people or be shared so many times. The comments and emails -- for the most part -- have been a wonderfully moving procession of individuals sharing their own journey through Alzheimer\u0027s or dementia.Lisa AbeytaFounder and CEO, APPCityLife Inc.At the moment, it seems Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are doing their job just fine. Why is there any need to overhaul this system?Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Built in the \"Great Gatsby era,\" this remarkable Art Deco building was the tallest tower in San Francisco for almost 40 years. Today, 140 New Montgomery may be only 33rd in height, but it\u0027s still the talk of the town, from NPR\u0027s KQED Radio in San Francisco to The Atlantic in D.C.Alison van DiggelenHost, FreshDialoguesAnat BanielDr. Jill Bolte TaylorThere are latent majorities on numerous issues that do not see the light of day because the corporatists\u0027 toadies -- the political leaders in Congress -- make sure there are no hearings, no floor debates or votes.Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorGetting a meaningful job seems unattainable right now. I can\u0027t change things that are beyond my control. I can\u0027t change the fact that I\u0027m 52, and that I\u0027m transsexual with a voice like a guy.Rebecca PellInstead of playing the data breach blame game, you need to take control of the situation. Do a few simple things every day and make yourself a tougher get, have the tools to quickly determine if you are in harm\u0027s way and have a solution in place to deal with the fallout.Adam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911As the IoT era dawns, we can expect integrated and networked devices to recognize our personal profiles and context for our present situations, tailor information to provide products we actually need, and even anticipate our desires, which, collectively, forever changes our lives and the world in which we live.James MooreBest selling author, TV political analystIn this age of mega-puff celebrity biographies, self-important, sensationalistic, dumbed-down and glitzed-up with gossip and sex scandal, this \"uncommon\" memoir of Swoosie Kurtz feels new.Carol Muske-DukesFormer Poet Laureate of California; Professor, University of Southern California, Dept. of English/Creative WritingWelcome to \"Game of Moans,\" the weekly recap of Game of Thrones Season 4 that highlights all the moan-worthy, gasp-filled, OMG moments that litter the Seven Kingdoms.Erin WhitneyHuffPost Fellow, TVOver the course of the next two months, the Tea Party movement may become to be seen (to mix a few metaphors) as more of a paper tiger than the tail that wags the Republican dog. To put it a little more concretely, the Tea Party may be losing some of its outsized influence over the Republican Party.Chris WeigantPolitical writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comApril 28 marks the tenth anniversary of the moment that the horrors of Abu Ghraib were made public in this country.

GreenbergDirector, Center on National Security at Fordham Law SchoolI didn\u0027t feel that I would be believed by my family, not because of anything they said to me, but because of the implicit messages I received from society.Erin McKelleActivist, writer, student at Ohio UniversitySeveral of the CLAs present with me in Berlin commented that given the nature and outcome of the week, the resulting document should probably be called the \u0027summary by policymakers,\u0027 rather than the \u0027summary for policymakers.\u0027Robert StavinsDirector of the Harvard Environmental Economics ProgramGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"CLIPPED",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
