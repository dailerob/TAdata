{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AP/Lauren Victoria BurkeQuestion of the week: who was more truthful -- emotionally and otherwise -- Sam Alito in his confirmation hearings or James Frey in \"A Million Little Pieces\"?? Our HuffPost bloggers weighed in hot and heavy on both those stories. Don\u0027t miss Harry Shearer, Bob Cesca, Jeralyn Merritt, Max Blumenthal, and Cenk Uygur on Alito, and Michael Smerconish, Richard Bradley, Toby Barlow, Rob Spillman, and RJ Eskow on Frey. And be sure and check out our Sunday Roundup below for more of this week\u0027s best posts.READ POST01.12.2006 Nora EphronI\u0027m with Oprah, who said the whole concern over whether Frey was telling the truth or not was just \"much ado about nothing.\" I feel the same way about what the President says about how we\u0027re doing in the war. I mean, big deal. We have got to get past these details and focus on what is important.READ POST | comments (65)01.13.2006 Martin GarbusThe New York Times will not tell us why they held the surveillance scoop story. I have heard reasons for not pressing the Times. I don\u0027t agree.READ POST | comments (31)01.12.2006 Rep. John MurthaThese particular explosive hatreds and tensions will be there if our troops leave in six months, six years or six decades. It is time to re-deploy our troops and to re-focus our attention on the real threats posed by global terrorism.READ POST | comments (402)01.09.2006 Rob ReinerIf bloggers should learn anything from newspaper columnists, it is that the annual ritual of year-end political prediction columns is really just a way to embarrass so-called pundits.READ POST | comments (95)01.11.2006 Seth GreenlandI had concluded the memoir genre is not for me. It is for this reason I wrote a novel. At least there you\u0027re allowed to make things up. But now that I know you can write a memoir the same way, I\u0027m reconsidering.READ POST | comments (15)01.12.2006 Arianna HuffingtonThis week\u0027s in-your face decision by Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, Iraq\u0027s most influential Shiite leader, to renege on his pledge to amend the new Constitution in a manner acceptable to Sunnis is the match that could ignite an all-out civil war in Iraq.READ POST | comments (103)01.14.2006 Jane SmileyNow it\u0027s time for a poll of Huffington Post readers. If 750 readers can respond to the smear of Jack Murtha, an equal number can type in a name of the central Bush Administration madman. Vote Now!READ POST | comments (170)01.11.2006 Robert ScheerWhat irony that those once young Republicans, who hectored their elders about being more vigilant in defending the nation\u0027s taxpayers and security forces, should now end up accused of deeply betraying both.READ POST | comments (31)01.12.2006 Katrina vanden HeuvelToday, some thirty years after Watergate, Elizabeth Holtzman, a leader in the impeachment of Richard Nixon, returns to the national stage stage to make the case for impeachment again: this time against President George W. Bush.READ POST | comments (94)01.12.2006 Paul RieckhoffNo one has been held accountable for this flagrant example of bureaucracy at its worst. If Congress can hold televised hearings on steroids in baseball, then it can probably find the time to hold hearings on this.READ POST | comments (34)01.09.2006 Jesse KornbluthIt\u0027s not that Fox has such a genius programming formula that everyone else slavishly imitates it. It\u0027s that the owners of other cable networks are not much interested in the news business.READ POST | comments (108)01.12.2006 Coleen RowleyHaving been part and parcel of the serious chain of errors leading up to and since 9-11, I see it as a duty to continue to insist on the utmost integrity, including the unraveling of the serious errors made by the Bush Administration.READ POST | comments (53)01.11.2006 James P. HoffaIt was the deadliest train crash in nearly 30 years, spewing a poisonous cloud of chlorine gas over the small community of Graniteville, South Carolina. And it could happen again.READ POST | comments01.11.2006 Trey EllisPerhaps the Europeans, have stood by to just watch us sink into this quagmire because they are tired of being pushed around. We were the big bull mastodon who mistakenly wallowed into the tar pit that is Iraq.READ POST | comments (35)01.13.2006 Hooman MajdIran will probably end up with nuclear weapons unless there\u0027s a strong enough incentive for them not to.READ POST | comments (18)01.14.2006 Terry TillmanOne day, in the height of frustration with the accumulation of power abuses, self-serving decisions and arrogance, I reread the Declaration of Independence and our Constitution.READ POST | comments01.14.2006 Jerome KarabelThe larger significance of Supreme Court nominee Samuel Alito\u0027s affiliation with Concerned Alumni of Princeton (CAP) has been lost in what has become a visibly partisan issue.READ POST | comments01.13.2006 Lawrence O\u0027DonnellWhen I went to work in the Senate, I thought most lobbyists were like Jack Abramoff, but I was wrong. In those days, none of them were as bad as Abramoff.READ POST | comments (24)01.14.2006 RJ EskowThe battle is on in New Orleans - between conservative social engineers (Republican and Democratic), and refugees who want to go home to their old neighborhoods.READ POST | comments01.09.2006 David CornHere\u0027s why the Abramoff scandal might grow larger than Abramoff\u0027s wide-ranging dealings: Once prosecutors start to look for crimes, they often find them.READ POST | comments (35)Reuters/Slahaldeen RasheedAP/Haraz GhanbariAFPFrom harvard.eduAP/Haraz GhanbariFrom dallasnews.comAP/Rick BowmerLogin to Huffington Post  |  Make Huff Post your Home Page  |  RSS/XML  |  Sitemap  |  Advertising  |  JobsCopyright 2005 © HuffingtonPost.com, LLC   |  User Agreement  |  Privacy  |  Comment Policy  |  Powered by MovableType","h1":"",".title":"","h2":"Murtha vs. Bush…Sunday RoundupOn Tuesday the Terminator Terminates a SeptuagenarianTruth vs. Fiction: The Battle for the FutureSunday RoundupBut Gather Together to Greet the Storm, Tomorrow Belongs to MeDon\u0027t Bench Alito - Sam the Sham, Part IIA Million Little EmbellishmentsHistory Prohibits Sulzberger, Times from Burying Facts of Meetings with Bush AdministrationSituation in Iraq Is Civil WarSometimes Predictions Are TOO EasyJames Frey is my HeroIraq Moves a Step Closer to Civil War; the MSM YawnVote NowBetraying the Reagan RevolutionElizabeth Holtzman--from Nixon to Bush \u0026 the Case for ImpeachmentThree Years Later, the Armor is On the WayAn Open Letter to George Soros: Buy CNNBullying and Threats Can\u0027t Smokescreen the TruthOn High AlertDelusions of Imperial Grandeur Have Only Hastened Our DemiseIranian Psycho?Grievances Against King GeorgeSamuel Alito and the Concerned Alumni of PrincetonGood Lobbyists, Good GovernmentBattle of New Orleans: Social Engineering, Conservative StyleWill Jackgate Destroy the GOP?","h3":"-Trey Ellis-Steven G.
