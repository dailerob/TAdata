{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"HuffPost Live launches tomorrow morning at 10 a.m. EST -- and we couldn\u0027t be more excited. Every new launch is like a birth, full of hope and uncertainty. And a baby\u0027s first words are always remembered. The opening lines spoken on MTV were \"Ladies and gentlemen, rock \u0027n\u0027 roll!\" When Ted Turner announced CNN, he promised the network wouldn\u0027t \"be signing off until the world ends.\" And ESPN kicked off with, \"If you\u0027re a fan, what you\u0027ll see... may convince you you\u0027ve gone to sports heaven.\" Now we\u0027re trying to decide what our baby\u0027s first words should be. And since HuffPost Live is designed to put the HuffPost community front and center in everything we do, we thought we\u0027d open up the discussion to you. So what do you think our opening words should be? Leave your suggestions in the comments, then tune in tomorrow morning to see if we picked yours.Read Post | Comments (240)Howard Fineman, 08/11/12Editorial Director, AOL Huffington Post Media GroupBy choosing Paul Ryan as his running mate, Mitt Romney assures that the election contest will be in public what it already was beneath the surface: a referendum on the centrality of government social-service programs to the real lives of average Americans.Read Post | Comments (4,623)Chris Kelly, 08/11/12Writer, \u0027Real Time with Bill Maher\u0027If there\u0027s one thing Paul Ryan likes, as laid out in his famous \"Path to Prosperity\" budget, it\u0027s weapons spending -- and the budget spells out exactly where he\u0027s going to find the money to buy more guns every year forever: He\u0027s going to crack down hard on rich tax cheats who game the system.Read Post | Comments (557)Marlo Thomas, 08/09/12Award-winning actress, author, and activistBelieve it or not, sometimes there are even greater heights to soar to -- and greater prizes to claim -- than Olympic glory.Read Post | Comments (46)Arianna Huffington, 08/08/12With an estimated $2.5 billion bankroll by the time this presidential election is said and done, you\u0027d think pretty much every important issue would get its place in the sun. Well, as it turns out, you don\u0027t always get what you pay for.Read Post | Comments (636)Paul Brandeis Raushenbush, 08/06/12Senior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostYes, Sikhs are not Muslims and Sikhs are not Hindus, but jumping to clarify difference leaves the unfortunate, if unintentional, perception that there is something wrong with those \"others.\"Read Post | Comments (323)D.L. Hughley, 08/09/12Actor and stand-up comedianDear Chick-Fil-A: It\u0027s not that I don\u0027t love you, we both know that\u0027s not true. I know I\u0027ll never find another like you. But baby, we are growing in two different directions. I\u0027m afraid I won\u0027t be able to see you anymore.Read Post | Comments (1,337)Sandra Fluke, 08/08/12Public Interest Law Scholar, Georgetown University Law CenterAs we walk into the voting booth we must remember the choice we\u0027re making. One option is a candidate who promises to turn back the clock on women\u0027s rights and our access to health care. Thankfully, we have a far better option: President Obama.Read Post | Comments (3,423)Robert Reich, 08/12/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Paul Ryan\u0027s views are pure social Darwinism, as reflected in his budget. Is this Mitt Romney\u0027s view as well?Read Post | Comments (191)Raffi Cavoukian, 08/10/12Troubadour, AuthorI feel like I\u0027ve lost a very dear old friend. Yet it\u0027s much more than that. Since hearing the news of your death, I have felt the loss of an extended family member -- one who had a profound impact on me. Kavna, meeting you moved me so deeply it changed my life.Read Post | Comments (34)Marian Wright Edelman, 08/10/12President, Children\u0027s Defense FundRight before the U.S. House of Representatives left for the summer to go home to campaign for your vote, they voted to extend the Bush-era tax cuts for the richest Americans millionaires and billionaires.Read Post | Comments (755)Yao Ming, 08/10/12Founder, Yao FoundationSince learning more about threats to wildlife, I wanted to go and see what\u0027s happening to some of these animals myself and so I\u0027m heading to Africa for the first time to learn about elephants and rhinos, two species in peril as a result of demand for ivory and rhino horn.Read Post | Comments (58)Michelangelo Signorile, 08/11/12Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay Voices; SiriusXM radio hostMitt Romney\u0027s running mate is a man who, like Romney himself, once supported gay rights -- and I do mean just one time -- only to run far away when he needed to genuflect before cultural conservatives.Read Post | Comments (177)Diana Nyad, 08/09/12Long Distance Swimmer, Journalist, BroadcasterAs much as the media pushes the medal count, we the fans are smarter than that. We don\u0027t care much about who wins. We want to feel. And in every sport there is a story to be told, feelings to be kindled.Read Post | Comments (24)Mitchell Bard, 08/12/12Writer and FilmmakerMitt Romney\u0027s choice of Paul Ryan speaks far louder than any (usually dishonest) words that have come from his mouth. Let\u0027s hope the American people are listening.Read Post | Comments (42)Norman Lear, 08/06/12Founder, People for the American WayI just got my first letter from Mitt Romney. I can\u0027t tell you what that means to me. For so long I have wanted a president who believes in America. He calls me \"one of America\u0027s most notable Republicans\" when I haven\u0027t given 10 cents to him or the party.Read Post | Comments (442)Brian Levin, J.D., 08/07/12Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State University\"I distinctly remember an email exchange with him shortly after 9/11 and he was very angry about Muslims and said something to the effect of America needing to go over to the Middle East and bomb \u0027em all. Aside from that, most of his rhetoric was not specifically targeted toward Muslims or Sikhs.\"Read Post | Comments (249)Richard A. Clarke, 08/09/12Former Advisor to the President on Cyber SecurityDespite the warnings of generals, intelligence officers, corporate cyber security experts, and academic experts that America is dangerously vulnerable to attack in cyberspace, John McCain and the right wing Chamber of Commerce succeeded in blocking Senate action to improve our ability to defend America against cyber attack.Read Post | Comments (200)John Kinnear, 08/09/12Father and part-time \u0027daddy blogger\u0027My son is living in his mom\u0027s belly right now, so obviously we don\u0027t know his sexual orientation. Still, the letter I read Tuesday morning made me wonder what my letter would say if the news that my son was gay ended up being a surprise. So here it is.Read Post | Comments (828)Kenny Loggins, 08/10/12Singer/songwriterI finally understand what I wished for as a young man in Pasadena, as a rock star in the \u002780s and again as a grown man starting over again in 2012... It\u0027s the whole enchilada: nerves, tears and all. This is exactly what success feels like.Read Post | Comments (38)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 08/09/12Author, research psychologist, and gender expertRaised voices and uncontrollable tears happen -- we\u0027re all human, and raising kids is never easy. But calm discussions, by contrast, teach kids that disagreements needn\u0027t be drama-filled.Read Post | Comments (61)Smokey Bear, 08/09/12Only you can prevent wildfiresBesides everyone doing what they can to help prevent human caused wildfires, we just got some extra help from NASA right here on Earth and from space.Read Post | CommentsJeffrey Sachs, 08/06/12Director, Earth Institute at Columbia University; author, \u0027The Price of Civilization\u0027The economic problems in the U.S. and Eurozone are mostly structural, not monetary. Unfortunately ideologues and politicians on both sides of the spectrum are interested in quick fixes rather than the real groundwork of economic progress.Read Post | Comments (437)Lisa Belkin, 08/10/12Senior columnist for life/work/family, The Huffington PostI regularly find myself listening to harsh exchanges between parents and children out in public and think \"is that how you ever thought you would sound back when you decided to have children?\" And I also wonder, \"do you even know how you sound?\"Read Post | Comments (16)Robert L. Borosage, 08/09/12President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureAn overwhelmingly negative campaign implies that the president\u0027s policies are already in place, which will give people little hope he\u0027d change things around. And worse, negative campaigns gain no mandate for moving forward.Read Post | Comments (648)David Wild, 08/09/12TV Writer; Contributing Editor, Rolling Stone; Co-Author, \u0027Diary of a Player\"\u0027Soon the 2012 Olympics will end, and the games of life as we know it will continue.
