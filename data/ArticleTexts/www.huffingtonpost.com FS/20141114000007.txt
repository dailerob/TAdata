{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureWith a stroke of the pen, the president can have a dramatic effect on the lives of millions of workers, leveraging not only the $1 trillion in spending on federal contracts, but setting an example that will accelerate similar action at the state and local level. President Obama has held up Costco as an example of a good jobs employer that is remarkably successful. It pays its workers a decent wage with good benefits, doesn\u0027t reward its CEO obscene bonuses, and respects workers\u0027 rights. In stark contrast, Walmart pays its workers so little that taxpayers end up paying billions to subsidize their low wages and lousy benefits. Clearly, the federal government should be standing on the side of good employers rather than rewarding exploitative ones.The costs to cities, coastlines and crops, as well as to the health and livelihoods of thousands, are mounting. China and the United States show the necessary determination to build a future based on low emissions through clean energy and livable cities because it makes sense for the environment and economies.President, World Bank GroupOur government persists with a business-as-usual path, despite the overwhelming scientific consensus that continued carbon emissions threaten the climate system on which civilization and nature as we know it depend.ClimatologistEnvironmental attorneyNovember is \"Adopt a Senior Pet Month,\" and adopting a pet isn\u0027t just good for your pet; it\u0027s good for you, too. Check out these nine scientifically-researched ways that pets improve the lives of their human companions.Productivity blogger and happiness life hackerIf ALEC were an honest broker, it would recommend market-based solutions, like the Republican-inspired, acid rain cap-and-trade program championed by President George H.W. Bush. But that\u0027s not likely going to happen, because doing so would alienate its fossil fuel industry and trade association members.Senior Writer, Union of Concerned ScientistsJust as advertisers\u0027 wishes have merged with (if not driven) technological change in the media universe, so in politics: Speaking to the larger mass audience is a rare event, limited to special ceremonial occasions like inaugurations.Your dog\u0027s best friendWe do not choose the work we were brought into this lifetime to do. That work is your soul signature -- your unique expression. Your spiritual DNA.Contemporary thought leader and spiritual teacherI\u0027ve never voted for a Republican in my life, but I\u0027m tired of terrorism causing us never-ending wars and political paranoia at home. If it\u0027s a choice between Hillary Clinton and Rand Paul in 2016, I\u0027m jettisoning many of my liberal values to vote for the Kentucky Senator.Columnist and journalist published in Salon.com, The Hill\u0027s Congress Blog, and other publications. Author of Logic of Demons www.hagoodman.comWhy does it seem that no one in the small business community is discussing or getting active about a policy issue that has the potential to seriously impact our livelihoods?Chief Insight Officer at Spring Insight, Web strategist, small business owner, answer seeker, chocolate lover, mom.The Democratic Party has core values that are very much in sync with most Americans. But this year, too many Democratic candidates lost sight of those core principles -- opting instead to clip their progressive wings in deference to a conventional wisdom that says bold ideas aren\u0027t politically practical.109th Mayor of New York CityThe execution of Mr. Panetti accomplishes no reasonable goal. Executing someone who does not understand the reason for his punishment violates not only the Constitution, but basic decency.Senior staff attorney, ACLU Capital Punishment ProjectToday\u0027s an achievement for everyone who\u0027s held a banner, signed a petition, and gone to jail -- and a call for many more to join us going forward!Author of a dozen books, including \u0027The End of Nature\u0027 and \u0027Deep Economy\u0027Whatever you call it, Race to the Top has hurt children, demoralized teachers, closed community schools, fragmented communities, increased privatization, and doubled down on testing. But I have an idea for a new accountability system that relies on different metrics.Research Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027You work hard, play hard, and want to live life to the fullest. Yet you can\u0027t do that if you don\u0027t get the right amount of quality sleep. Don\u0027t let sleep deprivation keep you from performing at your peak!Founder of CooperativeHealth. Chairman of Prostate Cancer Institute and Performance Research Labs. Co-Founder, Boost Mobile USA. Health \u0026 wellness advocate for 50+ men\u0027s health and author of the upcoming title \"The New Prime\".This is not the first time that Manuel Valls has proposed changing the name of the French Socialist Party. That he has returned to the subject from the vantage point of his present position -- which is, like it or not, the head of the majority -- obviously gives his suggestion new weight.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.The recent campaign of criticism targeting senior White House advisor Valerie Jarrett is, in some sense, unsurprising. But as leaders of some of the nation\u0027s largest advocacy organizations, we feel a moral obligation to tear down this half-baked caricature of one of the country\u0027s most powerful women.Co-Presidents, National Women\u0027s Law CenterPresident, Human Rights CampaignPresident and CEO, The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human RightsPresident and CEO, National Council of La RazaPresident of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Planned Parenthood Action Fund and Planned Parenthood VotesLeave it to Netanyahu, however, to use the Gaza experience to justify the continuation of the occupation rather than working out airtight plans with the PA that would entail security measures to ensure that the West Bank does not become a staging ground for attacks on Israel.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUWhile thinking about the Sandy Hook shooting evokes more sadness than anxiety in general, focusing on explanations leads to a shift in emotional tone from sadness to anxiety. Importantly, it appears that this emotional shift -- especially the growing anxiety -- is tied to people\u0027s lingering worry that a similar tragedy might occur in the future.Author, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027International photographer, photojournalist and artistAt the turn of the 20th century, the disparity in literacy here in the U.S. largely came down to race. Nearly half of minorities at that time -- 45 percent -- were illiterate, while 94 percent of white citizens were literate. Now, it\u0027s a different story: the total population, regardless of race, hovers near total literacy.Chairman/CEO, XPRIZEA few days ago, Google announced that it will donate $2 for every $1 people donate to nonprofits such as Médecins Sans Frontières and Save the Children in the fight against Ebola. As well-intentioned as this campaign might be, short-lived charity donations are not what is necessary to successfully eradicate the Ebola virus.Law Professor, Sociologist, PhD candidate at Columbia UniversityReading is one of the greatest pleasures in life. Taking the time to read improves your ability to focus, enhances your vocabulary, strengthens your empathy, and provides new experiences through a variety of characters.Co-founder, Carpe Juvenis: Seize Your YouthApproaching its 35th anniversary, the strategy of maintaining such a structure of garrisons, troops, planes, and ships in the Middle East has been one of the great disasters in the history of American foreign policy.Assistant Professor of Anthropology, American UniversityAnti-imperialism has survived as a pillar of ideology, as has Sinocentrism and Russocentrism, which focus overwhelmingly on resistance to the United States and its allies.Professor of Sociology, Princeton University and editor of The Asan ForumIn the bizarro election of 2014, where the anti-gay National Organization for Marriage backed pro-gay Democratic candidates to show the GOP that they will help defeat any Republican candidate who veers from the evangelical right\u0027s agenda, pro-gay hedge-fund billionaire Paul Singer helped the anti-gay GOP take control of the U.S. Senate.Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesLandmark though the US-Chinese bilateral agreement may be, it is still much more about domestic Chinese priorities than trans-Pacific good will.Attorney, foreign policy writerI follow the Sikh faith, which requires that I keep my hair long and wear a turban and beard. The ROTC recruiters said I would not be able to enlist unless I complied with all Army grooming and uniform rules.Student, Hofstra UniversitySo much has changed in recent decades -- the influx of women into the workforce, modernizing gender roles, new family structures -- and it makes no sense that our laws haven\u0027t kept up with social and economic change. In the second decade of the 21st century, why are we still living by Leave it to Beaver rules?U.S. Secretary of LaborMost Americans, if we can trust the polls, think our country is on the wrong track. They also seem to think that someone else put us there. Washington knew better. If America is failing, it is because we are failing to be what he knew we should and could be.Founder, Leadership for a Responsible SocietyRalph, for whatever reason, your vicious, personal caricature of Hillary Clinton has trashed a great friend of the consumer movement. Don\u0027t compound the error you made in 2000.Chairman of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety CommissionThe real problem in Ferguson is the fact that the residents are stuck with a police department that seemingly lacks ethnic diversity, appears racially insensitive and is unwilling to admit changes within are necessary.
