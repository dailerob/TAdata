{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Mark GongloffChief financial writer, The Huffington PostIn the future foretold by French economist Thomas Piketty, the rich will keep getting richer by doing basically nothing, living off the income generated by their already massive wealth. For many hedge-fund managers, that future is now. The world\u0027s 25 best-paid hedge-fund managers took home more than $21 billion in 2013, mostly for charging enormous fees for keeping an eye on huge piles of money, according to a new tally by Institutional Investor\u0027s Alpha magazine. It\u0027s a job most hedge funds do quite badly: The industry returned just 7.4 percent last year, according to Bloomberg, badly lagging the Standard \u0026 Poor\u0027s 500-stock index, which gained 30 percent. But such poor performance doesn\u0027t come cheaply to investors, with hedge funds typically charging fees of 2 percent of total assets under management and 20 percent of profits.It is particularly painful to see some members of Congress once again trying to circumvent a legitimate process to push approval of Keystone XL -- a pipeline that would take some of the world\u0027s dirtiest oil from Canada, through the heart of America, to the Gulf Coast and then off to overseas markets.Robert RedfordActor, director and environmental activistLight appeared, and with it, some fire, when Congressman Tim Murphy authored \"The Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act.\" Rep. Murphy, has proposed a broad variety of actions aimed at improving the broken system of mental health care, not just adding more programs or money to the already fragmented and far too unaccountable services that now exist.Lloyd I. Sederer, MDMedical director, New York State Office of Mental HealthAlready the GOP has bet heavily that its obsession with Obamacare will bolster its political position -- a bet that increasingly looks like a loser. Now, in its never-ending attempts to mollify the tea party fringe, the GOP leadership has turned down another political blind alley.Robert CreamerPolitical Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersIf you\u0027re born poor and don\u0027t go to college you\u0027re likely to remain poor, but if you finish college you\u0027re as likely to become rich as to remain poor. At its core, inequality is about education. If there\u0027s hope, it must lie with the schools.Evan ManderyProfessor, John Jay College of Criminal JusticeA mental health worker who alerts the police to a patient\u0027s suicide plan with a gun isn\u0027t infringing on anyone\u0027s 2nd Amendment rights. And an ER physician who\u0027s told by a patient that \"I\u0027m not going to let him beat me up again\" has a Hippocratic responsibility to inquire about the existence of a gun.Mike WeisserMike the Gun GuyI spent MANY years hating and hiding a body I was ashamed of because it wasn\u0027t society\u0027s ideal of beautiful. Being asked to send a photo of myself with a shirt on made me feel like I again should be ashamed of my body.Brooke BirminghamHealthy lifestyle bloggerI led a charmed and wonderful life, give or take a few glitches along the way, such as doing stunts that left my spine a mess and suffering a broken back in a helicopter crash. Nonetheless, I was still working and working out as I approached 80. In one stroke, literally and figuratively, it was all gone.Kirk DouglasActorSupreme Court rulings from Citizens United to the recent McCutcheon case have made a mockery of campaign finance reform and opened the floodgates. Two in three Americans say they trust government less because big Super PAC donors have so much more influence than they do. One in four say they are less likely to vote as a result.Andrew M. CuomoGovernor of New YorkDon\u0027t say I didn\u0027t warn you what a Supreme Court led by a Chief Justice John Roberts would be like on separation of church and state. In 2005, I was invited to be an expert witness in the Judiciary Committee\u0027s confirmation hearings on John Roberts appointment to be Chief Justice.Rev. Dr. Susan Brooks ThistlethwaiteProfessor of Theology, Chicago Theological SeminaryBy some estimates, one in four Americans suffers from a diagnosable mental illness. Yet conversations on mental illness are uncommon. That was until last year, when a schizophrenic man disembarked from a Greyhound bus in Sacramento, California.Dan RatherHost, \u0027Dan Rather Reports\u0027During the Cold War and the war on terrorism, expediency too often trumped principle. That is what makes our foreign policy weak, not the failure to use military force. The best way to strengthen our foreign policy is to rebuild our nation and revitalize our economy at home and make that our beacon to the world.Gary HartUnited States Senator (Ret.)The photographer was not used to kids like me. The ones in wheelchairs, the ones who couldn\u0027t sit up straight.Natalie E. Illumpoet, activist and storyteller living in Washington, DCScientists at Penn State have been studying effort -- when and why we either spend or conserve our energy. They set out to confirm the intuitive notion that we don\u0027t use any more effort than we must in our routine daily actions.Wray HerbertAuthor, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027In order for us to see real progress on climate change, our politicians need be just as embarrassed to stand next to the CEO of ExxonMobil as they would be to stand with the head of Philip Morris.Jamie HennCo-founder and Communications Director, 350.orgToday is International No Diet Day. In other words, food lovers, it\u0027s a day to fall off your \"don\u0027t even think about it\" dietary regimen, and dig in to you heart\u0027s content.Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistInstead of looking in the mirror, our politicians blame the schools. They say that we lost those jobs because our schools were preparing students poorly, not because the \"job creators\" wanted to export jobs to countries that pay their workers a few dollars a day.Diane RavitchResearch Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027Last week\u0027s Supreme Court ruling finally allows EPA to do its job on the related front of regulating air pollution that crosses state borders. That science-based, interstate enforcement effort alone, EPA research contends, will avoid somewhere between 13,000 and 34,000 premature deaths each year.Seth ShulmanSenior Staff Writer, Union of Concerned ScientistsIn today\u0027s society, marriage happens when two people (usually a man and a woman) fall in love and decide to spend the rest of their lives together in monogamy. But did you know that wasn\u0027t always the case?Lisa HaishaCreator of Transformative Therapy, SoulBlazingAlthough I celebrate the State of Israel\u0027s existence, I pray daily that the God of love and kindness will return to Jerusalem, rebuild Jerusalem to be in fact a city of peace in a state that embodies the loving kindness and generosity that has always been the hallmark of the Jewish people\u0027s aspirations.Rabbi Michael LernerEditor, Tikkun MagazineI lost my mother and very best friend in 1996, when I was 33 years old. In some ways I miss her more now than I did all those years ago.Shelley EmlingSenior Editor, HuffPost 50Even though French economist Thomas Piketty has made an air-tight case that we\u0027re heading toward levels of inequality not seen since the days of the nineteenth-century robber barons, right-wing conservatives haven\u0027t stopped lying about what\u0027s happening and what to do about it.Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027I spent a year being Jehnny Beth, night and day consumed by my persona, traveling the world and fronting Savages, doing my job the best I could. Bigger audiences pushed me to find the entertainer in me.Jehnny BethMusician, Co-founder of Pop Noire recordsThe Supreme Court ruling is another giant leap toward theocracy. We are descending to new lows, where non-Christians are openly scorned, made to stand up in public to be identified as outcasts.Jeff SchweitzerScientist and former White House Senior Policy Analyst; Ph.D. in marine biology/neurophysiologyWhen a Navy SEAL killed the man responsible for the murder of my brother, I was satisfied. But I would have been equally content had he been taken out of that compound in Pakistan in handcuffs and spent the rest of his life sitting in a cell.Andrew RiceFormer State Senator, (D)- Oklahoma.I\u0027m not just a \"paralyzed bride.\" I\u0027m Rachelle, a regular girl who had everything going for her when it all came crashing down. And my dear friend, who had only innocent intentions, is not just the girl who pushed me.Rachelle FriedmanBlogger; speaker; ambassador for the spinal cord injury communityIsrael\u0027s Independence Day is also Nakba Day. This is inescapable. The reality of Israeliness can\u0027t help but incorporate not only the Jewish story but the Palestinian story as well.Avraham BurgWhile flowers and greeting cards are thoughtful, millions of American women need something more important on this Mother\u0027s Day: lifesaving preventive health care.Rep. John ConyersDean, Congressional Black CaucusAs far as impact investing has come in seven years, there is still more to do to make it the norm, and give everyday investors access to a range of investment products.Dr. Judith RodinPresident of the Rockefeller FoundationIn most cases, your child should not have a credit report -- that is, until credit is taken out in his or her name. So if you get a call or a notice from a creditor regarding your child, or an invitation for them to apply for a credit card shows up in the mail (email or snail), don\u0027t dismiss it as a mistake.Adam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911It took centuries to get people to understand the earth orbits the sun. If it takes as long to get the public to understand and our politicians to understand the economy, billions of people will suffer needlessly.Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"NOBEL-WINNING ECONOMISTS: END THE DRUG WAR",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
