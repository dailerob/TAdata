{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupToday, Election Day, marks the end of the most expensive, least informative, least inspiring presidential election since TV took over politics in the Kennedy-Nixon race of 1960. Whose fault is that? All campaigns are about winning -– that’s the point of them -– but this one seemed to have squeezed out virtually everything else. As for the press, this was the Nate Silver Election. He was the symbol and bane. His odds-making in the New York Times –- a kind of racing tip sheet that the Times doesn’t even feature in the sports pages –- is the ultimate reductio ad absurdum of horse race coverage. His rise is the perfect metaphor for a society that seems only to care about winning; it doesn’t matter how or even why, but just that it is.Read Post | Comments (926)Adam McKay, 11/05/12Film director; Co-Founder, Funny or DieObjections to Obama are nonsense and lies at best. This isn\u0027t a \"liberal\" POV. It\u0027s just the truth.

That might happen, but the odds are fairly significant it won\u0027t.Read Post | CommentsRana Florida, 11/06/12CEO, The Creative Class GroupAs recent transplants to Toronto from Washington, DC, where we lived just a few miles from the White House, I felt it was my civic duty to host an election night party for my expat friends.Read Post | CommentsJason Grill, 11/04/12Owner of JGrill Media, National Writer/Contributor, Attorney, Former two-term member of the Missouri House of Representatives.Mark it down, the \"Redskin Rule\" is not continuing it\u0027s incredible run in 2012.

The model confidently predicts that Obama wins the election, with the probability of 270 Electoral College votes or more now up to 91.4 percent.Read Post | Comments (875)Sasha Bronner, 11/06/12Editor, HuffPost Los AngelesToday marks the third time I have been allowed to vote in a presidential election.
