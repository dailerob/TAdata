But from the perspective of domestic policy, it\u0027s much worse. His tax plan reveals nothing less than McCain\u0027s secret plan to diminish the US government beyond recognition. If he gets his way, conservatives will finally be able to say they\u0027ve achieved the goal set out by Grover Norquist: to get government \"down to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub.\"Read Post | CommentsBIOLarry Diamond, 05.10.2008The defining character of the 2008 election is what Barack Obama has called \"the fierce urgency of now.\" We simply cannot drift through another four years of aimless \"staying the course.\"Read Post | Comments (19)BIOMia Farrow, 05.11.2008When the best hope for peace in Darfur ultimately lies at a conference table, it is dispiriting but not surprising that government officials are refusing to negotiate with the rebel group JEM.Read Post | CommentsBIOKal Penn, 05.11.2008Your failure to pledge now risks returning those passionate, first-time voters to a political landscape that caused them to maintain such distance from the Democratic Party before.Read Post | Comments (53)BIODavid Roberts, 05.11.2008He could defy conventional wisdom by treating rural white voters like adults, helping them plan a real path to economic health and sustainability rather than telling them fairy tales about coal.Read Post | Comments (80)BIOMichael Shaw, 05.10.2008Cindy McCain\u0027s pain in this interview makes it that much harder to believe that the attacks against her daughter and her 2000 vote could be that exclusive of one another.Read Post | CommentsBIOHooman Majd, 05.10.2008If there were ever a perfect example of the Bush administration\u0027s utterly bankrupt foreign policy, it would have to be the State Department\u0027s reaction to events in Beirut over the last few days.Read Post | Comments (99)BIONicholas Stephanopoulos, 05.11.2008A law intended to benefit Republicans may instead have won the election for the Democrat running the more Republican-style campaign.Read Post | CommentsBIOGreg Mitchell, 05.11.2008In her book, Arianna contrasts the non-coverage of the Downing Street Memo in May 2005 with the massive attention lavished on Natalee Holloway and the Michael Jackson trial.Read Post | Comments (13)BIOJohn Eskow, 05.11.2008Many peace groups make it clear that while they oppose the war, they support our troops. McCain\u0027s real campaign slogan ought to be: I support the war, but I oppose our troops.Read Post | Comments (13)BIOCandy Spelling, 05.10.2008Just when I thought all the polling questions had been asked, the Wall Street Journal came through with a story about brides who survey their friends about wedding decisions.Read Post | CommentsBIODavid Sirota, 05.11.2008As all of this racism oozes out of the political establishment for all to see, we can recognize just how bigoted American culture is -- and recognition is the first step towards addressing a problem.Read Post | Comments (45)BIOFrank Schaeffer, 05.11.2008A vote for McCain is a vote against a viable Republican Party. It\u0027s a vote for the poisonous lunatic fringe that\u0027s taken over the heart of the Party and driven people like Arianna and me out.Read Post | CommentsDave Winer, 05.10.2008Josh Ritter, 05.09.2008Dan Sweeney, 05.11.2008Norman MacAfee, 05.11.2008Andy Worthington, 05.11.2008Al Meyerhoff, 05.09.2008John Bruhns, 05.09.2008Raymond J.
