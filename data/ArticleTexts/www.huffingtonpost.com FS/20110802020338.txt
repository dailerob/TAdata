{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"So much of the news and information directed at women these days seems determined to make us feel that our lives are somehow lacking. We are constantly made to feel that we should be prettier, thinner, sexier, more successful, better moms, better wives, better lovers, etc. Though often wrapped in a you-go-girl! message, the subtext is clear: we should feel bad because we have tummies, not abs; bad because we don\u0027t always feel like sex kittens, or bad because we do; bad because we don\u0027t have a color-coded filing system for our recipes. Not at HuffPost Women, which launches today. It is designed to be a place where women can come to be informed, inspired, entertained, and celebrated. Check it out here. I also want to announce a cool milestone: This weekend, HuffPost received our 100,000,000th comment! That\u0027s a staggering number, and we are really grateful to you, our community, for such amazing engagement and participation.Read Post | CommentsPeter S. Goodman, 8/1/11Business Editor, The Huffington PostWe have stepped back from the debt ceiling ledge, averted our gaze from the pavement below, yet find ourselves staring at something hardly more comforting: a bleak future.Read Post | CommentsSteven Van Zandt, 8/1/11Record producer, Songwriter, MusicianWhen people are looking for a place to point the finger after this disaster or near disaster they should look no further than the Media. When did their job become spewing out contradictory information 24/7?Read Post | CommentsDr. Peggy Drexler, 8/1/11Author, \u0027Our Fathers Ourselves. Daughters, Fathers, And The Changing American Family\u0027Fathers forced to be away from their families for long periods elicit sympathy and even admiration for their sacrifice. But for mothers in the same situation, the reactions are often more complex -- extending to maternal choice and even fitness.Read Post | CommentsJason Linkins, 8/1/11Editor, Eat the PressDo you remember a more innocent time in your life where you thought the purpose of legislating was to ensure positive-sum outcomes for ordinary Americans? Those were great times!Read Post | CommentsRobert Reich, 8/1/11Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Aftershock\u0027Anyone who characterizes the deal between the president, Democratic, and Republican leaders as a victory for the American people over partisanship understands neither economics nor politics.Read Post | CommentsJohn Robbins, 8/1/11Author, \u0027The New Good Life: Living Better Than Ever in an Age of Less\u0027Can gentically engineered foods help feed the hungry? Are anti-GMO activists and over-zealous environmentalists standing in the way of the hungry being fed?Read Post | CommentsSec. Kathleen Sebelius, 8/1/11Secretary of Health and Human ServicesWomen have unique healthcare needs across their life span and have high rates of chronic disease, including diabetes, heart disease and stroke. Yet while women are more likely to need preventive health care services, they often have less ability to pay.Read Post | CommentsDean Baker, 8/1/11Co-Director of the Center for Economic and Policy ResearchBefore anyone gets too excited about the risk of a downgrade, they should have an idea of what they think it means. I have yet to see anyone provide a remotely coherent explanation of what the credit rating agencies would be saying if they downgraded US government debt.Read Post | CommentsChris Weigant, 8/1/11Political Writer and Blogger at ChrisWeigant.comIn the new congressional joint committee, any plan will only require 7 votes out of 12 in order to move to Congress at large. Which means if one Democrat votes for a Republican plan, then that will be the committee\u0027s official plan.Read Post | CommentsMarlo Thomas, 7/31/11Award-winning actress, author and activistIt seems like a good time to take stock of how far women have come in this world. From my vantage point, I can\u0027t think of a more exciting time to be a woman: We\u0027ve finally reached our era of great expectations.Read Post | CommentsRichard (RJ) Eskow, 8/1/11Consultant, Writer, Senior Fellow with The Campaign for America\u0027s FutureToday we\u0027re watching the end of a brief manufactured crisis and the beginning of a long national nightmare. There\u0027s nothing to celebrate unless you\u0027re either an economic right-winger or very wealthy -- or both.Read Post | CommentsRobin Quivers, 8/1/11Anchor, \u0027The Howard Stern Show\u0027Captain America underscores the fact that we clearly have trouble confronting our own past, but we have no problem talking about other people\u0027s problems. Boy, did we get on those South Africans for apartheid!Read Post | CommentsRobert Kuttner, 7/31/11Co-founder and co-editor, The American ProspectThe United States has been rendered ungovernable except on the extortionate terms of the far-right. For the first time in modern history, one of the two major parties is in the hands of a faction so extreme that it is willing to destroy the economy if it doesn\u0027t get its way.Read Post | CommentsCarly Schwartz, 8/1/11San Francisco Editor, The Huffington PostOne of Burning Man\u0027s Ten Principles is Radical Inclusion. \"Anyone may be a part of Burning Man,\" its official website promises. And this year, even half the DJs planning to perform won\u0027t be able to get in.Read Post | CommentsSeth Shostak, 8/1/11Senior Astronomer, SETI InstituteWhen it comes to life in space, we have to do more than simply consider what\u0027s on our blackboards. We have to do the hard work -- we have to search. To quote Fox Mulder, the truth is out there.Read Post | CommentsKristin Anderson, 8/1/11Founder of MyDailyTrainer.comThe biggest question that I get is: how do you stay fit and still have a life? Well, it is easier then you think. It just takes a twist in your perspective.Read Post | CommentsGeorge Heymont, 8/1/11San Francisco-based arts criticThree new dramedies put the search for true love under a curious lens with appealing and often poignant results. Although each takes place in a different country, each is locked into a specific period in its local culture.Read Post | CommentsRabbi Shmuley Boteach, 8/1/11Rabbi and writerThank you, Lord, for the blessing of my daughter\u0027s engagement. And while I am truly grateful, would it offend some great celestial plan if I were to win the New York lottery?Read Post | CommentsRev. Tom Davis, 8/1/11Minister, United Church of ChristThe most effective response to cursing is public support, especially by clergy and laypeople who can directly counter the religious attacks on Planned Parenthood with a religious defense of its work.Read Post | CommentsScott Mendelson, 8/1/11Film CriticThis weekend is an excellent example of why it\u0027s the numbers, not the rankings that matter when discussing box office. And, more importantly, the context of the numbers must be taken into account as well as the hard figures.Read Post | CommentsJacqueline Novogratz, 8/1/11Founder and CEO of Acumen Fund, Author of The Blue SweaterI know many parts of Pakistan where girls have no education. \"Madame, that should change,\" another community leader tells me. \"It is wrong not to educate our children, boys and girls.\"Read Post | CommentsJared Bernstein, 8/1/11Senior Fellow, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesWhat did we just go through and what does it mean for our national politics, our fiscal and economic policy? If your conclusion is that Democrats got rolled because the president is a lousy negotiator, I disagree.Read Post | CommentsDavid J. Skorton, 8/1/11President, Cornell UniversityHow can more immigration be good for America\u0027s economy? The answer is that foreign workers make a substantial contribution to our country, particularly in the growing high-tech areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.Read Post | CommentsDavid Briggs, 8/1/11Writer, Association of Religion Data ArchivesIt\u0027s time to start making those struggling to meet basic needs more visible. Then maybe people might start to realize how well-off they are, and be willing to sacrifice a greater part of their discretionary income in taxes.Read Post | CommentsAndrew Reinbach, 8/1/11JournalistJust talking about a possible default has triggered likely credit downgrades of US Treasury debt that will drive up the cost of money worldwide, slow the global economy, and also, for us, raise unemployment -- and the deficit.Read Post | CommentsJa\u0027el Gordon, 2011.08.03Eishes Chayil, 2011.08.01Faheem Younus, 2011.08.01Mark J.
