{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027You know the statistic. We incarcerate a higher proportion of the population than any other country does. Hundreds of thousands of young, now aging, men, are doing hard time for possession of small amounts of drugs. More and more people find themselves in jail because they got caught with bench warrants for their arrest for exorbitant fines they could not afford to pay. More than a century after debtors prisons were abolished, thousands are again behind bars because of debts. But one category of felon is free on the street. I refer, of course, to corporate criminals. Consider the case of a checkout clerk at Walmart who puts her hands in the till and walks off with a couple of hundred bucks of the company\u0027s money. That clerk could expect to face prosecution and jail. Now consider her boss, who cheats her of hundreds of dollars of pay by failing to accurately record the time she clocked in, or the overtime she worked.We now have an imperative to address expanding economic disparity and environmental hazards, which are adding fuel to geopolitical tensions around the world, and to reassess the role of business can play in improving the world for future generations.Chairman and CEO of SalesforceThese infants were counting on us, their herd, to provide them with community immunity until they were old enough to get vaccinated. It is not science\u0027s fault that these children, our fellow Americans, caught the measles. It is not their parents\u0027 fault. It is the fault of the anti-vaxxers.Pediatrician in Washington DC, member of the National Physicians AllianceThe euphemism is the \"share\" economy. A more accurate term would be the \"share-the-scraps\" economy. New software technologies are allowing almost any job to be divided up into discrete tasks that can be parceled out to workers when they\u0027re needed, with pay determined by demand for that particular job at that particular moment.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Candidates can be vague, like Bush, or confusing and ridiculous, like Huckabee, for only so long. Soon enough they\u0027ll have to explain exactly what they mean.Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesScrapping complicated, costly, time-consuming eligibility tests would save billions. Substituting a program assuring all children their needed health care with no other eligibility condition than being a kid (that is, below a specified age) would accomplish their coverage. Let\u0027s call it Medikids.Founding Co-director, Social Security WorksProfessor Emeritus, Washington University Law School; Founding Board Member, National Academy of Social InsuranceA number of labels that originally signified progressive ideas continue to be (mis)appropriated, their radical potential drained away, with the result that they\u0027re now invoked by supporters of \"bunch o\u0027 facts\" teaching or a corporate-styled, standards-and-testing model of school reform.Education expertIn mid-January the popularly-esteemed, British-born Buddhist nun, Jetsunma Tenzin Palmo -- the closest thing we have to a Thomas Merton figure today -- spoke before a sold-out audience at the Rubin Museum of Himalayan Arts in Manhattan.Cultural critic, essayist and novelist published with Parkett, Art in America and Bijutsu TechoNever in the course of American diplomacy have so many travelled so far for so little. The enormous entourage of dignitaries accompanying Barack Obama to Saudi Arabia last week broke all records.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghI had tried many times to be a different, gentler kind of mother -- but what I\u0027ve finally come to realize is that I couldn\u0027t be a gentler kind of mother until I could be a gentler kind of person with myself.Writer and Blogger, Mama One to ThreeBeginning this Sunday February 1, Huffington Post Black Voices will kick off a month-long feature tackling 28 different cultural and political issues affecting Black lives.Executive Director of the Black Alliance for Just Immigration, Co-Founder of Black Lives MatterCalling it inexplicable would be kind. Calling it the worst decision in Super Bowl history would about fit.Writer, actor and radio hostPentagon insiders called it \"the long war,\" an open-ended, perhaps unending, conflict against nations and terror networks mainly of a radical Islamist bent. Over the years, its chief characteristic became ever clearer: a Groundhog Day kind of repetition.Retired lieutenant colonel (USAF)There are a lot of people who would rather get a good spanking than a box of chocolates for Valentine\u0027s Day and I\u0027m all for that. The problem I have with Fifty Shades of Grey is that it\u0027s BDSM for Dummies, it\u0027s BDSM Lite.Los Angeles dominatrix talking about kinky people and the kinks in life.The ongoing assault on the civil justice system in our country has resulted in a lessened public appreciation of the law of torts, which is one of the major pillars of our legal system and provides crucial protections for individuals. Now comes the American Museum of Tort Law.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorThe Disney outbreak could be a game-changer for those of us trying protect children with immunizations. Because suddenly, there is a vaccine-preventable disease that is spreading like wildfire -- and could be dangerous.Pediatrician, Boston Children\u0027s Hospital, Harvard Medical SchoolThe concern with campus sexual assault has begun to take on the characteristics of a panic in which government officials and school administrators have increasingly lost sight of other fundamental values that must shape the culture of institutions of higher learning.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of Chicago\"I thought you worked on abortions so how can you also believe Black Lives Matter?\" That was the question I was asked when, on the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, I posted remarks, via social media, on the importance of honoring this anniversary.Executive Director of SisterSong, the National Women of Color Reproductive Justice CollectiveThis is why advertising creatives are important and why some agencies are better than others. Yes, make the star relevant, surprise people, get viewers excited. But once you get past that step, sell something that aligns with your creative.Blog Editor, Huffington PostNo matter how many outlets -- from trashy gossip rags to (supposedly) reputable entertainment magazines -- make claims about Bruce Jenner\u0027s current \"journey\"...Executive Editor, HuffPost Gay VoicesAbout a month ago, I adopted a dog. Now -- a month later -- I\u0027m still rescuing that dog. Bambi, my beautiful two-year-old pup, is a Pit Bull mix. I was ready for the wide array of problems new rescues often have. What I was not expecting, and what I was not ready for, was The Great Pit Bull Bias.Writer, editor, and designer.The financial fee is a seven basis point (seven one-hundredths of one percent) tax or fee on the roughly 100 large financial firms with assets of at least $50 billion. Yet there\u0027s an interesting and important wrinkle here: the tax is not on profits or assets, as is typically the case.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorOne conclusion from all the panels is that because the brain is so complicated and we know very little about its actual workings, we need to catalogue it before there can be important breakthroughs. With its billions of cells and neurons, the brain is a big-data exercise, and we now have the tools needed do so.Advisor to government and business leaders; Author, The Digital Economy, 20th Anniversary EditionAs February dawns, you\u0027re seeing a lot more red and more hearts.

Am I biased? Yes. Do I care?

Will Walker be the JimmyWho or Bachmann of 2016? With 20 contenders, this contest can\u0027t be clown car -- at worst a clown bus. Then: will the Kochs inspire a backlash that helps overturn Citizens United?Host, \u0027Both Sides Now\u0027What if, instead all the negative food-body thoughts, feeling like a failure, and regret-eating, we could have a lighter more positive touch and just make a few super do-able substitutions to our recipes?Jewish Food Hero Editor and CreatorThe people of Greece rebelled last week against the perverse notion that they should continue to endure biting austerity in a vain attempt to cure a condition that they are not solely responsible for creating. Sounds familiar, right?International President, United SteelworkersIs it just me, or is a carpet with those sweet, beautiful vacuum lines almost as beautiful as looking at a sunset over the ocean?Online magazine for twenty-something womenIf we ever are going to break the cycle on increased incidence of cancer, leadership needs to look beyond the trenches of cancer treatment and expand their focus to prevent cancer cases from increasing.Founder, Lesscancer.orgGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"MOST-WATCHED SHOW IN U.S. HISTORY",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
