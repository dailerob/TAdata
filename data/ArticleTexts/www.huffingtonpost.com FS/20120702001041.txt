{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week was all about the Supreme Court -- and the suddenly surprising John Roberts. First, the Chief Justice guided the court through a split-the-baby decision on Arizona\u0027s immigration law, allowing the noxious \"show-your-papers\" provision to stand while striking down three others. (Splitting the baby was very much in vogue: see News Corp.) Then came the landmark health care ruling in which Roberts, perhaps mindful of a recent poll showing three-quarters of Americans think he and his fellow justices allow political views to influence their decisions, found a narrow way to uphold Obamacare -- a move that left many conservatives fuming, caused Justice Kennedy to accuse Roberts of \"vast judicial overreaching,\" and prompted Albert Brooks to tweet: \"It\u0027s a terrific day in America. I\u0027m gonna go out and get wildly sick.\" Much closer to home, we mourned the passing -- and celebrated the life -- of Nora Ephron (see here, here, here, here, here -- and read Nora\u0027s HuffPost posts here).Read Post | Comments (55)Marcia Angell, M.D., 06/29/12Physician, Author, Senior Lecturer, Harvard Medical SchoolThe Supreme Court\u0027s decision to uphold Obamacare puts me in mind of the old proverb: Be careful what you wish for.
