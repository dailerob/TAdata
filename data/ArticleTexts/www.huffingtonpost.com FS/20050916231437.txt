So get ready for the New New Orleans -- Karl Rove’s Big Easy -- featuring the Halliburton French Quarter, the ExxonMobil River (formerly the Mississippi), Lake MBNA (formerly Pontchartrain), and Eli Lilly music (formerly jazz).READ POST | comments (64)09.16.2005 Paul StilesIf Katrina had hit virtually any other nation in the same way, it would not have generated this much bile. But in the eyes of many Europeans today, America is a fallen hero.READ POST09.16.2005 Rep.
