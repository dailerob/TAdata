{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AriannaHere is my thought for the weekend: Get some sleep! A fresh wave of studies shows that pretty much everyone in America is dangerously under-rested… with the well-documented exception of our president. I’ve been writing about this problem for some time (and I am, I admit, guilty of it too) -- and it’s only gotten worse. Indeed, they’ve now found a connection between our nation’s sleep deprivation crisis and our growing obesity crisis. So when you finish reading this (and checking out The Blog, including a post from master yoga teacher Scott Hobbs), do yourself -- and your country -- a favor: take a nap.05.20.2005 Harry ShearerThe Right\u0027s attack on the mainstream press began more than thirty years ago, when the recently-retired Bill Safire put in then-not-yet-disgraced Vice President Spiro Agnew\u0027s mouth the words attacking \"the nattering nabobs of negativism\" in the press (always alliterative, that savvy Safire).read whole post | permalink05.21.2005 Simon JenkinsA year ago I walked in the market square in Fallujah. I have done some crazy things in my time but I would not walk down any street in Baghdad today. Please, America, realize that in Iraq you have not created another Vietnam or Beirut or Somalia. You have created something far, far worse and getting more so.read whole post | permalink05.21.2005 Stephen ElliottA fifteen-year-old boy sets off to commit his first crime. He\u0027s a bumbling criminal, his chances of success were never good. Who is this young Jesse James and where did he get his gun? Who cares? The boy is sentenced to thirteen years in adult prison. There will be no school, no rehabilitation. The child is thrown into a warehouse, a crowded meat locker.read whole post | permalink05.21.2005 Jay GordonMost of the doctors and researchers involved in denying that vaccines cause autism are recipients of large sums -— millions of dollars in some cases -— from the vaccine industry.read whole post | permalink05.21.2005 Seth GreenlandAfter the Koran-in-the-can story, and Friday’s photos of Saddam kicking back in his underwear, what’s next for the U.S. military? An all-out panty raid? The whole world’s becoming a frat party and the President of the United States is manning the keg.read whole post | permalink05.20.2005 Janet GrilloEight years ago Matthew was diagnosed with Autism. Nine years ago he began to disappear. First it was words. He forgot alphabet letters, and the names of the animals in the picture book we used to look at and read together, side by side, me pointing and him labeling. Then his entire body began to go limp.read whole post | permalink05.20.2005 Arianna HuffingtonAt a news conference yesterday, Condoleezza Rice was asked about the New York Times story depicting U.S. military commanders as increasingly pessimistic about the outcome of the war in Iraq. Her answer was a model of obfuscation with more than a hint of that Bush administration specialty -- complete and unrelenting deception. So, as a service to those who prefer their leadership straightforward and candid, I’ve taken the liberty of translating her response from Modern Bush-speak to plain English.read whole post | permalink05.20.2005 Cable NeuhausSo now it finally emerges -- the truth about Saddam Hussein\u0027s underwear. He wears briefs, white, probably knit. Pictures of the nearly naked former dictator were splashed across the front page of two big newspapers Friday morning, one in London, the other in New York. Not surprisingly, both papers are owned by Rupert Murdoch.read whole post | permalink05.20.2005 Scott HobbsThe first step in improving your breathing is to become aware of it. Constantly. It’s not enough to be aware of your breathing while practicing yoga, working out or going for a run. You also need to check in with your breathing the rest of the day.read whole post | permalink05.20.2005 David CornAs far as I could tell, I was one of the few Bushwhackers who obsessed over el presidente\u0027s bike ride during the false alarm a week-and-a-half ago that caused security officials to evacuate the White House and Congress. And conservatives pooh-poohed my concern. But now Laura Bush has backed me up.read whole post | permalink05.20.2005 Sandy FrankIndra Nooyi, the president and CFO of PepsiCo, got in trouble the other day for a speech she made to the graduating students at Columbia Business School, because in that speech she compared the United States to a middle finger. I agree that she should be in trouble, not because the message was offensive to the United States, but because it was one of the most inane speeches I\u0027ve ever heard of.read whole post | permalink05.20.2005 Naomi FonerHow do they explain \"a culture of life\" that supports the death penalty? Freedom that denies \"choice\"? \"Free elections\" in Iraq where not everyone gets to vote? An American culture that allows for prison torture and spying on it\u0027s own populace? Cut backs in Social Security and health care. Compliments for vigilantes at the border. Add it up.read whole post | permalink05.20.2005 Adam McKayIf Republicans are upset about the comparisons between Darth Vader and George W they had better stay away from any movie dealing with power and corruption run amok or movies about weak sons who lead with arrogance...read whole post | permalink05.20.2005 Geoffrey R. StoneWhen was the last time you saw combat footage of American soldiers wounded or dead? When was the last time you saw footage of Iraqi civilians inadvertently killed by American fire? Of course, such images are deeply painful. But they are critical to the proper functioning of a self-governing society. Such images do not exist, however, in the American media.read whole post | permalink05.19.2005 Peter BartThe only ripples were stirred by Lars Von Trier, the noxious Dane, who turns out art films about America’s moral failings.
