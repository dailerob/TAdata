{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027At a time many Republican presidential candidates and state legislators are furiously focusing on private morality -- what people do in their bedrooms, contraception, abortion, gay marriage -- America is experiencing a far more significant crisis in public morality. CEOs of large corporations now earn 300 times the wages of average workers. Insider trading is endemic on Wall Street, where hedge-fund and private-equity moguls are taking home hundreds of millions. A handful of extraordinarily wealthy people are investing unprecedented sums in the upcoming election, seeking to rig the economy for their benefit even more than it\u0027s already rigged.Dr. Michael Breus is a clinical psychologist and author of The Sleep Doctor\u0027s Diet Plan: Lose Weight Through Better Sleep. In answer to my questions, he shared his thoughts on the major obstacles to getting a good night\u0027s sleep, the steps you can take to improve your sleep, and the future of sleep technology.Congress shall make no law prohibiting the free exercise of religion. The question (and it is a question that cannot be answered by just parsing the text) is, What does it mean to freely exercise one\u0027s religion?Davidson-Kahn Distinguished University Professor and Professor of Law at Florida International University; Floershimer Distinguished Visiting Professor of Law at Cardozo Law SchoolOpening the new community toilet may lack the glamour of cutting the ribbon on a new hospital, so fewer politicians lobby for their communities to gain sanitation.Chief Executive of WaterAidThis book explores the gruesome misdeeds of a murderer (and rapist), but it is also an extended reflection on how and why one might write about, and even befriend, such people. On both counts, it is an admirable success.Author, \u0027The Catonsville Nine: A Story of Faith and Resistance in the Vietnam Era\u0027Our global economic and political system is the root cause of the problem, so instead of blaming Europe, lets fix the problemWe cannot continue indefinitely to strike at jihadists in Iraq while stopping, absurdly, at the border of the neighboring state.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.New York has long been overdo for a Sarah Charlesworth retrospective. Throughout the summer of 2015, the New Museum filled the void with Doubleword a partial-survey of Charlesworth\u0027s work curated by Massimiliano Gioni and Margot Norton, a most welcome arrival.Cultural critic, essayist and novelist published with Parkett, Art in America and Bijutsu TechoIt\u0027s expensive to be poor. So expensive in fact that people who live below a country\u0027s poverty line can end up paying 5-15x per liter of water compared to people who live above that poverty line.Chief executive officer and co-founder of Water.orgActor and Co-founder, Water.orgBEIJING -- The most pronounced aspect of difficulties between the U.S. and China is America\u0027s rejection of China\u0027s political system. In the eyes of many Americans, China values collective interests and lacks democracy and human rights, while in the eyes of many in China, Americans, who believe in individual rights, have a natural tendency to engineer political evolution in other countries, and therefore we need to be on guard. These oversimplified perceptions have put the two countries at two ends of the world, running parallel and never seeming to converge.Chairperson of Foreign Affairs Committee, National People’s CongressDonald Trump may not be Ronald Reagan, but the Ronald Reagan that whipped Jeb\u0027s father was not the saint of people\u0027s imagination either. Jeb might have the better resume, he might be a man of compassion, but neither experience nor compassion are the currencies of the moment.President, Fiscal Strategies GroupNow we witness the return of the medium in Greece, after six whole years. Will it influence something this time? It would be difficult, but it is not impossible. While voters remain reluctant and morose, and political leaders fail, it may play a role.Editor-At-Large, HuffPost GreeceAs with marriage reform, the bulk of the action with marijuana legalization has been at the state level, with most members of Congress hesitant to express support until public opinion moves well past the tipping point. This is starting to change.Executive director, Marijuana Policy ProjectThe news business has devolved into just another branch of the entertainment business. Many are well aware of this. Few, though, appreciate the degree to which even the elite media -- e.g., The New York Times -- contribute to the phenomenon.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghMs. Coulter outlines why she believes immigration to be America\u0027s greatest threat -- an idea that has been embraced by many leaders on the right, including current GOP frontrunner Donald Trump.PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorCooperation must be based on trust in order to be effective. And because the United States is still the biggest kid on the block, we must take the initiative in quieting the China-bashing rhetoric to begin the transition to a trusting and genuinely cooperative relationship.Confucian scholarThere are plenty of things wrong with the labor movement. It can be overly bureaucratic. There are corrupt officials in many unions. But there should be no doubt that the country is much better off as a result of the labor movement and prospects for progressive change would be brighter if it were stronger.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Black Lives Matter is far from a perfect organization, but contrary to what the conservative media would have you believe, the only special treatment BLM is asking for is to not be treated special.Political blogger, Detroit NewsNo doubt, the bombastic Donald is an unlikely president. Yet what may be most extraordinary about his campaign is that on foreign policy, at least, he may be the most sensible Republican in the race.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteNo one is prepared for an era when editing DNA is as easy as editing a Microsoft Word document. The government does not have any regulations on editing human DNA. The ethical concerns have not been fleshed out. There is no centralized risk-management inventory, listing which labs are doing what with CRISPR. It\u0027s all rather terrifying.Academic, Researcher, Writer, EntrepreneurGay men need to stop perpetuating misogyny and ally themselves with the feminist movement. And the first step toward becoming a true ally is listening to women speak about the issues that are important to them, whether it\u0027s wage equality, reproductive rights, access to birth control or anything else.Voices Editorial FellowA Romney candidacy will starkly reveal the problems the GOP faces in 2016, and they are much bigger than the mercurial Trump. The GOP has become the vehicle for a set of ideas that American voters will reject in the general election, no matter who is the standard bearer.Senior Fellow, DemosAmericans are looking to corporate citizens to embrace their responsibilities to workers and the public. The enormous popularity of minimum wage increases and anti-wage theft measures are a powerful barometer of this desire, and one that Uber and other sharing economy players would do well to heed.Partner in Union-Side Law Firm Bush, GottliebIn thinking through the hundreds of breakups I\u0027ve seen on this show, I\u0027ve learned so much about how to dump someone. And listen, take your, \"but they aren\u0027t even real relationships on this show\" nonsense elsewhere; everyone is allowed to feel deeply in any setting where they make themselves vulnerable for a love interest.Writer, reader, worshiper of Beyoncé. Musings at alicemcalex.comThe majority of women migrate to reunite with family, make a better life for their children, or escape violence that in their home countries. But our current laws make it harder for these women to come legally, and harder to become citizens when they do get here. So what do women need in real immigration overhaul?Money Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsWhile many other sustainability challenges will remain, the tide of climate change will literally be reversed. This will free us to focus on other challenges such as the widespread use of toxic substances throughout our economy. There is a great deal riding on Jerry Brown and California\u0027s ambitious climate program.Executive Director, Columbia University\u0027s Earth InstituteWe know that government action can bring down the rate of maternal deaths because we see it happening everywhere around the world. Everywhere, that is, but here. We have a lot of catching up to do.President, National Organization for WomenIf we are going to prepare our students for the global marketplace, we must address the challenges minority students face, find ways to keep them in high school, and then support their transition to higher education--whether traditional four year college or vocational training.President Kuepa.com Blended Learning in LatinamericaAttacks on women\u0027s self-determination in body, mind and spirit are a staple of our political life because they work. Unless and until we confront the root reasons why patterns of violence against women work, both overt and covert violence against women will continue to be a political mainstay.Professor of Theology, Chicago Theological SeminaryAkbar Ganji, one of Iran\u0027s known political reformists, recently made a petition regarding the Iranian nuclear agreement, which has been signed by some prominent and respectable intellectuals. But it contains some questionable arguments which need to be addressed if the reactions to the agreement are to be understood.Political sociologist, writer, democracy activistThis is the world of Grandma Minnie, the Brooklyn of my youth, full of wonders and windows as far as I could see, out of which countless heads would lean and call for children I didn\u0027t really know.Author, New York Times bestseller \u0027The Book of Awakening\u0027Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
