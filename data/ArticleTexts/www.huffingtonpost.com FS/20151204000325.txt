{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressAssociate Politics Video Editor, The Huffington PostFor your consideration, we present to you the incredible true story of the longest uninterrupted moment of silence ever attempted. No one can remember when, exactly, the moment began. Was it in 2011, after six people died in a mass shooting in Tucson, Arizona? Historical footage suggests it may have started two years earlier, after a gunman terrorized Fort Hood, Texas, slaying 13. Memory suggests it may have been even earlier. It depends on who you ask. Regardless, this moment of silence is one of our lawmakers\u0027 greatest bipartisan, bicameral accomplishments, an inspiring response to crisis that is also regularly performed at the White House. It is a thrilling triumph of activity over achievement, and sentimentality over substance.Justice -- of sorts -- was finally delivered as Donald Blankenship, the former Chairman and CEO of Massey Energy, was convicted of conspiring to willfully violate mine safety standards at the Upper Branch Mine in West Virginia, where 29 workers died in April 2010. Here\u0027s a blog I wrote about it a few months after the disaster.Instead of asking, or even begging, corporations and countries to please reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in Paris, we would like to follow The Pope\u0027s lead and suggest that there is a simpler, more effective and more just way to deal with the existential threat facing life on this planet.Composer, singer, actor and activistCommunication Strategist, Author of \"Words That Shook The World\"Democratic Senator from Rhode IslandSinger and songwriterGun ownership isn\u0027t some inalienable right granted by God. Remember, the Constitution was written by men coming out of a long and bloody war near the end of the 18th century. It was written for their time. It also included the \"right\" to own a human being. Things change.Comedian; author of \"DC Trip\" (Adaptive Books)On November 24, 2015 the General Assembly of the United Nations passed six anti-Israeli resolutions -- in one day. Some of them relate to issues that should be addressed: Occupation, settlement building, Palestinian rights, peace. But the text of each and every one is outrageous.Author, \u0027My Promised Land: The Triumph and Tragedy of Israel\u0027Gun violence, Islamic terrorism, and anti-Muslim bigotry are all real, serious problems that need to be faced head-on. It\u0027s disingenuous to be in denial about one or the other just because you have a certain political affiliation.Pakistani-Canadian writer, physician and musicianIf you\u0027re hurting like I am right now, thinking about the epidemic of gun violence in this country, but you have not yet contacted your elected representatives to make your voice heard, it\u0027s time. This is our country, and elected officials work for us. Don\u0027t go down without a fight.Writer and comedianYesterday\u0027s massacre in San Bernardino again underscores the ineffectiveness of relying upon bulk data collection and intelligence agencies\u0027 watch-listing processes to \"keep us safe from terrorism.\"Former FBI Special AgentAny U.S. citizen who believes there is not a serious problem in the U.S. Armed Forces with fundamentalist, evangelical Christianity, must be, as I often remark to my students when I describe some particularly egregious and otherwise inexplicable failing, \"smoking some good stuff.\"Colonel, U.S. Army (Retired)In the same week we had an attack on Planned Parenthood and one on a centered for disabled people. The first with a clear ideological motive or so it would appear, yet no pro-life leader was asked to condemn these actions.Chairman and CEO, Mogahed ConsultingWant to know what the pro-gun crowd thinks about gun violence? Or I should say, what the pro-gun crowd wants everyone else to think about gun violence? All you gotta do is wait for a mass shooting to occur, then check the Twitter accounts of the so-called GOP presidential candidates.Mike the Gun GuyI know how tired you are. I know how exhausting it is to hold the weight of an entire faith and group of people, regardless of whether or not the actions of a few are not part of the faith you love so dearly.Muslim ActivistI\u0027m skeptical of your decision to move the $45 billion to your own privately controlled LLC, because, well, that\u0027s not actually giving anything away. It is still privately controlled by you with no decision-making power by the communities who need the better world you described to your daughter.Executive Director, Resource GenerationWhat words are left? That fact that people are still able to purchase weapons of war, some of which were appropriately banned under the now-expired Assault Weapons Ban, is a moral failure on the part of our nation.Director of the Center for Peace and Spirituality and University Chaplain at Pacific UniversityWith nine days remaining in the negotiations, it\u0027s impossible to know exactly how that agreement will turn out, although no one expects a definitive \"solution\" to the problem of climate change.Executive Director, The Sierra ClubThere is no doubt that mass shootings are \"terrifying\" and \"terrorize\" the community where they have happened. However, few active shooters involved in mass shooting have a political message or cause. The church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina was a hate crime, but still not a terrorism act.Independent source of news and analysis, from the academic and research community.Assume that the hawks get their way -- that the United States does whatever it takes militarily to confront and destroy ISIS. Then what?Author, \u0027The Limits of Power: The End of American Exceptionalism\u0027Trained as a journalist, I was always told to stand a little apart from the story, not to get too wrapped up in the moment. But, what I witnessed last week, along with Refugees International advocate Mark Yarnell, consultant Renata Rendon and Board vice chair Elizabeth Galvin on the Greek island of Lesvos was truly overwhelming.Chair of the Board at Refugees InternationalWhether it\u0027s calling women who exercise their reproductive rights \"contract killers\" or ignorantly proclaiming condoms as the only form of birth control worth worrying about, women continue to be disrespected, vilified and subject to horrific violence in the name of political debate.President, National Organization for WomenNone of the above candidates are calling for a database of extreme right wing evangelicals. White supremacists who murder black church goers and white young men who shoot school children don\u0027t qualify either.Actress and authorInstead of continually interceding in the war taking place within Islam -- inconsistently, incoherently -- the United States has to step back and help build a new Muslim consensus against the Islamic State and extremism more generally.Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogOne year ago, a grand jury failed to indict NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo for the killing of my father, Eric Garner. As I contemplate this past year -- a year full of upheaval and struggles for justice -- I\u0027m struck by what has changed: nothing.Founder of Garner Way Foundation and daughter of Eric GarnerPolitical Director at the Garner Way FoundationDuring several meetings I recently had with EU officials, they argued that it is time to revive the Middle East Quartet. I took the opposite position because I believe that the Quartet failed from the onset to breathe new life into the peace negotiations. In fact, it has become a major impediment to the peace process.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUThey may turn out to be a little more randomly shaped and spikier than the traditional rounder and flatter \"pancake,\" but that only adds to their crunchy deliciousness. In our house we serve them with a dollop of sour cream and a spoonful of caviar. And champagne. Of course.Creative Director and CEO, Fig Tree \u0026 VineThe world has not been kind to Kobe Bryant\u0027s poem. The Black Mamba announced his retirement via ode the other day, and, in discussing it, almost everyone channeled their inner literary critic long enough for a potshot or two at Kobe\u0027s literary chops. We decided to try our hand at an alternate Kobe Bryant retirement poem, built from his own words.AuthorAuthor of \u0027Where Bears Roam the Streets,\u0027 \u0027Ovenman,\u0027 and \u0027The Taste of Penny\u0027History and engagement editor, Zócalo Public SquareWe are better than this. We need to make advancements on mental health issues in this country, but in so doing, we cannot advance a harmful and false understanding of these disorders.Congressman representing the 20th District of New YorkWe cannot ignore the ethical implications of what we are doing to current and future generations, whose opportunities in life will be diminished by the harm we are doing to our planet\u0027s natural systems.Nobel Peace Prize winner; founder, Grameen Bank; Chairman, Yunus CentreR. Kelly is a star. He is celebrated widely. He is a man that Black women trust, stand proudly on stage with and call \"brother.\" He is, most importantly, a man who has had repetitive, well-documented and authenticated sex with children and has called himself the \"Pied Piper\" to mock them.The premiere online magazine destination for African-American cultural insight, news and perspective.McDonalds is gross and greasy. But my humiliation, and that of my friends and my family, wasn\u0027t because I made burgers. It was because I was supposed to be \"better\" than that. I realized this attitude was way more gross than shoveling fries. Because I am not better than a McDonalds worker.Freelance writer and web designerOver the last few years there has been undeniable momentum to end our country\u0027s disastrous war on drugs. Both voters and elected officials are looking for alternatives to the unwinnable drug war. 2015 continued the trend. Here are some of the top stories of the year that give us hope.Director of Media Relations, Drug Policy AllianceGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
