{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor of Law, UCLAIf the Court\u0027s ruling is read to permit challenges to laws barring discrimination against LGBT people, Hobby Lobby will be the Arizona law on steroids. It wouldn\u0027t apply in one state but across the nation. So while a business corporation can\u0027t go to church, fast on Yom Kippur, or travel to Mecca for Ramadan, it can still go to court and, on the basis of religious freedom, demand to be exempted from the law that applies to everyone else. Today, women are the victim. Tomorrow, it could be LGBT people. Indeed, after Hobby Lobby, every person is at risk. Everyone, that is, except the corporate person, my friend.Our constant rhetoric -- particularly from Washington -- asserts that we have made progress since the colonialism of King Leopold in the Congo. International criminal justice and human rights are pursued with relish, are they not? Not according to the example of Richard Bruce Cheney.Colonel, U.S. Army (Retired)The thought occurred: Wouldn\u0027t the economic dislocations of a serious effort on climate change be more bearable if the economy were at full employment? And also: What would it take to finally get us out of the aftermath of the financial collapse? The answer is pretty straightforward. We need massive public investment in both basic infrastructure and in a transition to a sustainable economy.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Two things are absolutely clear about this Supreme Court term. One, it\u0027s once again been a very good term for the Chamber of Commerce. And, two, it\u0027s been an even better one for the business community writ large.Founder and President, Constitutional Accountability CenterTwo or three decades from now, the twentysomethings of Tahrir Square or the Casbah in Tunis or Martyrs\u0027 Square in Tripoli will, like the Havels of the Middle East, come to power as politicians. In the meantime, here are three of their achievements that seem likely to be lasting, whatever the upheaval in the region.Professor of Modern Middle East and South Asian History, University of MichiganOn this final day of the term, the Supreme Court will be handing down a decision with potentially broad implications not only for the rights of women and workers, but also for corporate personhood and religious liberty.Chief Counsel, Constitutional Accountability CenterThe Facebook experiment should thus be a wake-up call that there are some very challenging issues ahead for privacy that we must think more deeply about. Facebook is in the spotlight, but move the light over just a little, and you\u0027ll see many others.John Marshall Harlan Research Professor, George Washington University Law SchoolThe government-imposed barriers to entry in the pharmaceutical industry don\u0027t just raise prices by 20 or 30 percent, as may be the case with taxi fares; they raise prices by a factor or 10, 20, or even 100 (that would be 10,000 percent).Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Three hundred years ago, during the Age of Enlightenment, the coffee house became the center of innovation. Back then, most people went from drinking beer to consuming coffee (i.e. from being tipsy to being wired) and ideas started exploding.Chairman/CEO, XPRIZEWe\u0027re rearing children in a world that is obsessed with how technology can help us avoid error and save time, we must be careful not to completely diminish the great joy that is found in the small and happy accidents of life.postgradgrays.comBefore finding fame and garnering several Emmy nods and two Golden Globe wins for his role in TV\u0027s House, he was a member of Cambridge University\u0027s Footlights Revue and a familiar face -- as a comedian -- on British TV.PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorThe twentieth anniversary of the Rebbe\u0027s passing is being accompanied by the portrayal of the Rebbe as the founder of Judaism with a smile. But this is not the whole story and it sanitizes the Rebbe\u0027s legacy. In truth, the Rebbe was a revolutionary.Rabbi and WriterAmerican teachers today work harder under much more challenging conditions than teachers elsewhere in the industrialized world. They also receive less useful feedback, less helpful professional development, and have less time to collaborate to improve their work.Charles E. Ducommun Professor of Education at Stanford UniversityThe big unreported story of the Iraqi crisis is the failure of American intelligence agencies to foresee the ISIS campaign. Indeed, the ISIS phenomenon from its emergence two years ago until now has largely passed under the radar of the CIA, NSA et al.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghIn some quarters in the United States, the supposed superiority of unregulated capitalist enterprise over government programs for the delivery of social services is a virtual religious mantra. But should it be?Social studies educator, Hofstra UniversityLike our nation, the Internet was founded on the principles of openness and competition. It has become the ultimate marketplace of ideas, where everyone has a voice and the best products or services succeed based on their own merit. Open Internet principles are the Bill of Rights for the online world.Chairman, Senate Judiciary CommitteeSince religion is a big part of the worldview of any adherent, it doesn\u0027t seem too much to ask that future presidents at least consider a wider range of religious diversity when considering equally-acceptable candidates to the highest court in the land.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comFor a growing number of women, staying home is not a choice. More mothers say they\u0027re staying home because they can\u0027t find work that pays for the rising cost of child care. Many simply can\u0027t find a job at all.Business Reporter, The Huffington PostI believe that by moving culture, you create space for politicians to enact policy; sometimes good and sometimes not so good. In this case, we know that the work of these artists will only uplift this nation for the better.Founder, GlobalGrind.comWhen it comes to mentally ill inmates, it seems the system is caught in a bit of a catch-22 -- they\u0027re not receiving the assistance they need on the inside, but the outside often presents a similarly poor scenario, and tends to lead released inmates right back into the system.Founder of whoarethewe.com, lifestyle blogger, cotton candy enthusiast, www.yesliketheriver.comThe workers ringing up your meatballs and helping you find shelving units on your next trip to Ikea will have something to smile about starting next year: higher pay.Policy Analyst, National Employment Law ProjectNo traditional pizza. Not even an ice cream sandwich. No bagels! Let me just say: When you also get that initial craving for a large burrito with its warm, floury tortilla, all your inhibitions tend to go out the window.Blog editor, The Huffington PostWhat\u0027s the reason for the tempest in the teapot of Hillary and Bill Clinton\u0027s personal finances? It can\u0027t be about how much money they have. Great wealth has never disqualified someone from high office.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027At the time Professor Ore insisted that there was much more that happened that evening, but her story was not taken seriously and certainly it appeared nowhere on the news.Louise Hewlett Nixon Professor, Stanford UniversityRemember that life is a journey, not a destination. Once you think you have it all figured out, you cut off your capacity to make mistakes, discover new horizons and become an even better version of your already awesome self. Be the student. Be the beginner. And reap the rewards of a calm and happy life.Author of forthcoming Type-A Zen, Spiritual CEO, Life Coach \u0026 Biz Strategist. Live your dream, make an impact \u0026 say om!Just when we thought the rights of women, workers and minorities faced enough setbacks, it appears the nation\u0027s highest court has done it once again. The Supreme Court\u0027s majority has very clearly shown where its interests are -- and they are not with the people.President, National Action NetworkThe level of religiosity of a footballer has little correlation to their passion for winning the World Cup. No matter how hungry a journalist is to chase a Ramadan story.Writer and advocate focusing on Muslim women in sportsI sit down with Professor James Fallon, renowned neuroscientist and author of The Psychopath Inside, to talk about the past, present, and future of psychopathology, the violence of Elliot Rodger, and why these \"human predators\" might, for better or for worse, be necessary.A huge sigh of relief mixed with curses -- that\u0027s my reaction to the Supreme Court\u0027s decision today to block home care workers in Illinois from being required to pay union dues, while continuing to allow public employee unions to collect dues from all the workers they represent.Senior Fellow, Roosevelt Institute; author of \u0027Fighting for Our Health\u0027Americans should ignore these Sirens of Death. Attempting to forcibly transform Iraq never was Washington\u0027s responsibility. Having botched the job once, U.S. policymakers should not try again. There certainly is no public support for new military adventures in Mesopotamia.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteFacebook\u0027s actions were justified according to the industry ethical standards, but they were clearly inconsistent with the research community\u0027s ethical standards.Professor of Computer Science and Public Affairs, Princeton UniversityGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"THE OPERATIVES 5 Justices Go After Women, Workers... \u0027Baldly Incoherent\u0027 Rulings...
