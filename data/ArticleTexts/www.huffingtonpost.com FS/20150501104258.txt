{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesSome in the media have portrayed the Supreme Court justices\u0027 questions in Tuesday\u0027s historic marriage equality oral arguments -- particularly those by conservative justices talking about ancient Greece and the \"millennia\" -- as completely out of touch. That may be so when it comes to actual history, but sitting inside the court during arguments in Obergefell vs. Hodges on Tuesday as a protestor screamed out, \"If you support gay marriage, you will burn in Hell!\" I couldn\u0027t help but think that the court, judging by the questions posed and predictions base on 2013\u0027s Windsor decision striking down the Defense of Marriage Act, actually represents where the American people are on marriage equality.He doesn\u0027t go on and on about the woods and the rivers -- he goes on and on about working class Vermonters who can\u0027t afford health care and heating oil. His issue is inequality and unfairness, and it has been from the start. And for those of us who do work mostly on the environment, that\u0027s just the kind of ally we need.Author of a dozen books, including \u0027The End of Nature\u0027 and \u0027Deep Economy\u0027This is our creed, to serve as a platform for artists who affirm that the world that we see and experience today is not all there is and not all that can be.Alice Pratt Brown Director of the Whitney MuseumThis is not just about policing. Not just about race. It is about the country we are allowing ourselves to become and the affront it is to the country we are meant to be.Former Governor of Maryland and Mayor of BaltimoreSomehow, opponents of discrimination are considered liberal fascists, whereas relegating an entire demographic of law-abiding citizens to second class status is considered \"freedom.\"Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027President Obama would make the world a much safer place if he took U.S. land-based nuclear missiles off hair-trigger alert. He has called the policy a \"dangerous relic of the Cold War,\" and a number of high-ranking military officers and government officials agree. So why hasn\u0027t Obama done anything about it?Senior Writer, Union of Concerned ScientistsOn the one hand, we lift up and celebrate the non-violent legacy of Dr. King. On the other, we want to know why aren\u0027t there more mothers, like the one in the video, willing to beat their children into submission. Forgive me cable pundits, if I am not able to hear you talking out of both sides of your neck.Senior social justice editor, Blue Nation ReviewWhile nine in ten Americans agree there\u0027s too much corporate money in politics, Doug Hughes alone decided to carry out a life-endangering mission to expose Washington\u0027s descent into a money-fueled corruption pit.Co-Founder, Ben \u0026 Jerry\u0027s Ice Cream and Head Stamper, StampStampede.orgI love to make places for art, because art is beauty. Because art makes people better people and it switches on a little special light in their eyes. Art suggests curiosity and desire.ArchitectI credit my education to Ms. Mabel Hefty just as much as I would any institution of higher learning. When I entered Ms. Hefty\u0027s fifth-grade class at Punahou School in the fall of 1971, I was just a kid with a funny name in a new school, feeling a little out of place, hoping to fit in like anyone else.44th President of the United StatesAmerican friends, especially PEN Club writers, please read, right now, Caroline Fourest\u0027s new book, Eloge du blasphème (In Praise of Blasphemy, Grasset 2015), if you wish to understand.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.It is a dark secret that tobacco companies make more use of these agreements than perhaps any other industry. There have been at least thirty trade and investment cases brought on behalf of big tobacco. The TPP will spur more.Professor, Author, Advocate, Lecturer, and Social CommentatorThe Whitney\u0027s debut on Gansevoort Street is a sign of something significant -- it is the consecration of New York\u0027s return as a true waterfront city.Founder and chairman, New Cities FoundationModern advances in food science, both in how we produce and deliver food, have become key battlegrounds in the science versus fear-mongering debate.Senior Fellow, Progressive Policy Institute and partner at Shook, Hardy \u0026 Bacon, L.L.P.If we truly care about things like the economic inequality or class mobility, putting more degrees in the hands of academically talented young people from poor areas is certainly a way to make a significant difference.Executive Director, Jack Kent Cooke FoundationIt\u0027s time for Hillary Clinton to take a position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement and the fast track authority designed to ramrod it through the Congress. Hillary has been non-committal to date, with many assuming she will eventually support the president whom she served as Secretary of State. But now the pressure to take a stand is growing.President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureWhat happens next? A serious movement for political and social change has to cohere around the endemic violence. The changes must include better-trained police, an end to racial profiling, the demilitarization of the police and a national embrace of community policing. This is just a start. We need a new civil rights movement. Let it begin with a moment of silence.Syndicated writerHe\u0027d get on the back of a jet ski and point that box at me while I surfed, or fell. While I surfed and screamed during the hardest year of my life.

He was the perfect person to do it.Actress, Director, ScreenwriterOn Wednesday afternoon, a subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing on legislation that, if successful, would be a giant step forward for corporate America and an equally giant step backward for consumers.Executive Director, Public JusticeAmerican sweatshops didn\u0027t begin to improve significantly until labor unions began representing their workers. Accordingly, if we truly wish to help Bangladeshi textile workers, it won\u0027t be by refusing to purchase the apparel they produce. All that will do is destroy their livelihoods. Rather, the goal should be to promote the Bangladeshi labor movement.Playwright and author (\"It\u0027s Never Been Easy: Essays on Modern Labor\")A study published in Nature Neuroscience found that children from the most disadvantaged families had brains with a smaller surface area than those from families with higher incomes. The reflexive rhetoric of political scientist Charles Murray and others claim it supports their view that there\u0027s not much you can do to educate poor kids. But that\u0027s not what the science says.Writer-in-residence at The Education TrustSocialized into a deeply internalized sense of superiority and entitlement that we are either not consciously aware of or can never admit to ourselves, white people become highly fragile in conversations about race.\"Getting it\" when it comes to race and racism challenges our very identities as good white people.The conversation no one else is having.History and religion are only rarely brought into American foreign policy or rhetoric.General Editor, The Norton Anthology of World ReligionsPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideBefore Nepal and Baltimore seized headlines, news that a CIA drone strike mistakenly killed an innocent American hostage in January momentarily energized our meager debate on drones. It is time for us, as Americans, to exercise our responsibility as citizens and take control of the debate.Author; Professor of history, Stanford UniversityBERLIN -- Tsipras squandered Greece\u0027s opportunity, because he and other Syriza leaders were unable to see beyond the horizon of their party\u0027s origins in radical opposition activism. They did not understand the difference between campaigning and governing. Realpolitik, in their view, was a sellout. Of course, it is precisely the acceptance of necessity that marks the difference between government and opposition.German Foreign Minister and Vice Chancellor from 1998-2005American politicians frequently declare that \"Israel has a right to defend itself.\" Seldom does anyone ask if Palestinians have that same right, or even the right to enjoy freedom of movement in their own homeland.Author of \"The Lemon Tree: An Arab, a Jew, and the Heart of the Middle East.\"Many of us cannot (and should not) go there. So how can we help rebuild Nepal from afar now that it is near the end of the first phase of rescue and the second phase of relief has only just begun?

If these do not eventuate, one may well witness emptier stadiums abroad and hear shriller voices at home. Ultimately, for PM Modi to sell the Incredible India story, he will need to make India credible.Senior Fellow and Vice President, The Observer Research FoundationThe GOP can never pass up an opportunity to make themselves look like complete buffoons, and a protest following the funeral for Freddy Gray, who died from a severe spinal cord injury while in police custody, is no exception.
