{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorIt is not enough to show rising inequality and wring your hands and rend your garment. You\u0027ve got to explain why it\u0027s problematic. In some cases -- the split between median compensation and productivity -- the connection hardly needs elaboration: workers are baking a larger pie yet getting smaller slices. But a connection that I consider especially important is that between inequality and opportunity. To the extent that a greater economic distance between classes is blocking the opportunities of those on the \"wrong\" side of the income divide, a fundamental value of ours is blocked. Americans do not believe in equal outcomes; many of us do, however, believe in equal opportunities, or at least that someone ought to be able to achieve their intellectual, economic, and spiritual potential.Comments (373)Theo JansenArtistIn my talk, I mentioned that the Strandbeest would develop a digital brain. Let me tell you about the evolutionary development of Strandbeest after 2007.Comments (17)John CusackMakes films; Board member, Freedom of the Press FoundationThe Snowden Principle, and that fire that inspired him to take unimaginable risks, is fundamentally about fostering an informed and engaged public.

Diane and I had been inseparable for years and it took me what felt like forever to get over feeling betrayed. I agonized over what I had \u0027done\u0027 to deserve such mistreatment, and spent months eating my lunch alone under \u0027our\u0027 tree on the playground.Comments (119)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027There are two great centers of unaccountable power in the American political-economic system today -- places where decisions that significantly affect large numbers of Americans are made in secret, and are unchecked either by effective democratic oversight or by market competition.Comments (593)Susie EssmanActress, Curb Your EnthusiasmMy husband doesn\u0027t hate Mad Men. He likes it a lot. Not as much as I do because my like borders on obsession and fixation. But he likes it. What my husband hates, is me, after I watch Mad Men.Comments (25)Amb. Marc GinsbergFmr. U.S. Ambassador to Morocco \u0026 White House Middle East AdviserFor all the ballyhooed determination to stand up for democratic change in the Middle East and pledges to never stand by when tens of thousands of innocent people are being massacred, Syria will regretably prove to be a major policy reversal on both counts.Comments (101)Arianna HuffingtonThis is a moment of great possibility and opportunity for all of us to play our part in course-correcting, and leveraging the best parts of the spirit of business and entrepreneurship to bring about fundamental changes to the ways we do business -- for the benefit of individuals, communities, and companies.Comments (437)Patton OswaltComedian and writer who lives and drinks in Los AngelesThere is a collective consciousness that can detect the presence (and approach) of something good or bad, in society or the world, before any hard “evidence” exists. It’s happening now with the concept of “rape culture.” Which, by the way, isn’t a concept. It’s a reality.CommentsIllah NourbakhshDirector of the CREATE Lab and Head of the Robotics Master\u0027s Program at Carnegie Mellon University\u0027s Robotics InstituteWhether we enter a robot utopia, a robot smog or somewhere in between, we will close the gap between robotically aware and organically alive.

Whether we are suburban moms hoping for a good nap out of our toddlers or renowned actresses or CTOs or television personalities or political big shots, we\u0027re parents.

Period.CommentsSeamus McKiernanAssociate Blog Editor, The Huffington PostThis 9-year-old cancer survivor is on a mission to take back the term \"bucket list.\" One game of \"messy twister\" at a time.

The challenge is to work together to do everything in our power to build a safer, more prosperous, more sustainable, and fairer future.Comments (42)Foz MeadowsAuthor, blogger, bipedal mammal with delusions of immortality and carbon-based lifeform extraordinaire.If and when sentient AI becomes reality, will it, too, have the capacity to both anthropomorphize and dehumanize other beings in relation to itself? And if it did, would we view it as more or less human depending on which skill it used to refine its opinion of humanity?Comments (13)Kia MakarechiEntertainment Editor, The Huffington PostIt seems like what\u0027s happening here is that Miley Cyrus \"loves\" \"hood\" culture, thinks it\u0027s amusing and has no problem co-opting it for singles and/or viral videos, but doesn\u0027t love the idea of herself being seen as part of it. And that\u0027s gross.CommentsMartha BurkMoney Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsThe annual June Father\u0027s day shopping binge is at its zenith.

Just count the number of companies giving paid leave to men with newborns.Comments (48)Maggie FurlongWest Coast Editor, Huffington Post TV\"Food Network Star\" feels like sloppy seconds this season -- for good reason. It\u0027s the latest reality competition show to fall victim to several reality TV \"professionals.\"Comments (23)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistThere comes a moment in the life of every parent and child that defines their relationship. Sometimes it\u0027s planned, more often it\u0027s spontaneous, but in either case, it captures the soul of that most sacred familial connection. And sometimes -- if you\u0027re lucky -- it sets the tone for everything that follows.CommentsMichael BoltonSongwriter, recording artist and Chairman, The Michael Bolton Charities, Inc.This Father\u0027s Day can be remembered as the day when we fathers turned a collective corner, reducing domestic violence and sexual abuse to an aberration, not an everyday occurrence.Comments (29)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesHaving railed against gay marriage back when he was in Argentina, only to lose that battle, he may be seeing that the handwriting is on the wall and that he\u0027s got better things to do. And that can only be a loss for anti-equality advocates who hoped the pope would loudly lead their crusade.Comments (83)Lori DunlapWriter, researcherMy husband had to take over all household duties, including the many daily tasks required to take care of our two young sons.
