{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Charles and David Koch should not be blamed for having more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of Americans put together. Nor should they be condemned for their petrochemical empire. As far as I know, they\u0027ve played by the rules and obeyed the laws. They\u0027re also entitled to their own right-wing political views. It\u0027s a free country. But in using their vast wealth to change those rules and laws in order to fit their political views, the Koch brothers are undermining our democracy. That\u0027s a betrayal of the most precious thing Americans share. The Kochs exemplify a new reality that strikes at the heart of America.Comments (310)Mark GongloffChief financial writer, The Huffington PostMonopoly\u0027s new \"house rules\" will probably not be popular in the houses of Ron Paul or Rick Perry. Many of those rules are straight out of their Fed-hating nightmares.Comments (58)Kelli CatanaBlogger, www.kellidaisy.comI am a bad parent. And I am a good parent. I am your typical, average parent. I had four kids in five years and I\u0027m pretty sure that I was a bit insane for about three and a half of them. I am guilty of being bossy and I am guilty of shoving electronics into my children\u0027s hands if it buys me peace.CommentsGabrielle Giffords and Mark KellyToday, you are more important than we are. It\u0027s up to you to lead. Make the choice to serve. Endeavor to do something extraordinary. And when life throws setback and challenges your way, grit your teeth and keep on going.CommentsBob CescaManaging Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowIn order to build the National Park Service for posterity, we all have to make at least a small effort to block attempts to destroy it. Clearly, the GOP is only concerned with scoring points with fringe wackadoodles who can\u0027t seem to remember anything that happened prior to January 20, 2009.Comments (36)Paul Brandeis RaushenbushExecutive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostWorld Vision just announced that they have reversed their policy, announced only two days ago, to accept gay Christians as employees. This is so sad, and so bad for everyone.CommentsChristian GabrielArtist, writer and musicianBeing poor anywhere sucks, but there\u0027s perhaps a particular kind of soul crushing that one experiences being poor in New York City. On average, after rent and bills, I probably had less than three hundred dollars per month to put toward food, other expenses and social activities.Comments (187)Alexander KjerulfSpeaker, consultant and authorIf you hate your job, you have to act on it. You have to either figure out how to improve your current work situation or you have to find another job where you can be happy. The only option you don\u0027t have is to do nothing, because staying in that job you hate can make you sick.Comments (11)Sharda SekaranManaging Director of Communications, Drug Policy AllianceIt would seem that marijuana has finally entered the mainstream of U.S. and international politics. However, someone has neglected to tell the many news outlets that continue to recycle the same old \"Cheech \u0026 Chong\" images that should have been retired decades ago.CommentsRalph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorUnfortunately, despite lofty initial campaign promises by the Obama administration, widespread government secrecy has only worsened in recent years and access to information by journalists and activists is disturbingly limited.CommentsOliver Stone and Mark WeisbrotThe Bush administration had a policy of trying to isolate Venezuela from its neighbors, and the strategy ended up isolating Washington instead. Obama, in his first meeting with hemispheric leaders in 2009, promised to turn a new page. But today, his administration finds itself even more isolated that that of his predecessor, and for much the same reasons.Comments (20)Susan P. JoyceEditor and chief technology writer, Job - Hunt.orgIn the last few years, the widespread use of search engines and the growth of social media have changed recruiting in ways that are transparent to most job seekers. Not understanding those technological changes makes job hunting more challenging (and discouraging).CommentsDave GoldbergHemingway had it mostly right: \"When people talk, listen completely. Most people never listen.\" I\u0027d actually take it a step further: most people never ask.CommentsBernard-Henri LévyFrench philosopher and writerLet me say quite calmly, and adhering strictly to the facts, that the National Front is not the solution sought by voters discouraged by the toxic climate of French politics today.CommentsStephanie MadsenThree-time cancer survivor, motivational speaker and bloggerHaving lost my hair several times over from the slew of cancer treatments I\u0027ve received over the last two years, I understand what it feels like to be bald. I am nearly 20 years older than Delaney, and can\u0027t even fathom what she has had to go through at such a young age.CommentsAkbar S. AhmedSenior at Yale University from Karachi, PakistanWe Pakistanis are long past faith in our institutions -- often, we\u0027re the first to suspect that they\u0027ve played a hand in ruining our nation. We just don\u0027t like it when the West points that out. All this fear and cynicism make for a heavy burden.Comments (19)Harvey WeinsteinFilm ProducerAt a time when immigration reform is on every news channel and in every newspaper, this film shows a piece of the sacrifice so many made to come and live in America.Comments (26)Jessica LovejoyPositive Body Image AdvocateThe truth is women are not the only ones who can suffer from poor self-image. And to assume that men don\u0027t is absurd.CommentsEmily SpitzerExecutive director, National Health Law ProgramI am writing today as a mother, and thinking of my own daughters as they enter the work force. Let\u0027s think about the potential impact of a Supreme Court decision finding that a secular, for-profit company does not have to follow a federal law of general application on the grounds of religious freedom.Comments (15)Ben GreenfieldAuthor of Beyond Training book; fitness expert; Get-Fit Guy podcast hostTo understand why I\u0027m not too concerned about germs, and why you shouldn\u0027t be either, you need to grasp a concept called the \"hygiene hypothesis,\" along with two other important hypotheses.CommentsWray HerbertAuthor, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027University of California, San Diego, psychologists doubted the very premise of such speed reading -- that eliminating eye movements is a worthy goal. Instead, they contend, this is the \"fatal flaw\" in speed-reading apps -- and the reason they will never be useful for reading any text that is not easy or short.Comments (12)Jon HorfordStudent, University of MichiganWe all have goals and ambitions that we believe will bring us a sense of everlasting satisfaction and purpose, but it is the people and memories that occupy the space between that make the struggle bearable.CommentsDr. Judith RodinPresident of the Rockefeller FoundationI believe philanthropy has found its identity once again, as a convener, a risk-taker, a piloter of good ideas, and a partner in bringing those ideas to scale. Indeed, it\u0027s an exciting time to be in philanthropy. But I believe there are areas where we can do better and push ourselves further to maximize our impact in the years ahead.CommentsCarl PopeFormer executive director and chairman, Sierra ClubThe decision by the Obama administration to reopen federal drilling leases in the Gulf of Mexico to BP opens an interesting window into a fundamental question: What does it mean to hold a corporation accountable and responsible?CommentsZoe LintzerisBlog editor, The Huffington PostHere are just eight reasons why Baltimore still shines on as a mid-Atlantic gem, because -- as everyone from here knows -- why be less when you can Bmore?Comments (36)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesIt\u0027s interesting how some cases that national LGBT groups warned against not only were net positives but spurred still other cases that the groups warned about but which also advanced progress. And, in the end, the cautious national groups came aboard.Comments (36)Michael WinshipSenior writer, Moyers \u0026 Company on public TV. Senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.The argument goes that instead of being jealous, we all should be working in harmony together to create jobs and opportunity. Problem is, the deeply rich talk about building the economy but do almost nothing about it.Comments (101)Rep. Diana DeGette and Rep. Louise SlaughterThe combination of extending a business owner\u0027s religious beliefs to a for-profit company and then using those corporate rights to discriminate against employees and customers who do not adhere to that religion could have implications far beyond the Affordable Care Act.Comments (40)Queen Rania of JordanQueen of the Hashemite Kingdom of JordanWhat unites them is their strength, resilience and resourcefulness. They\u0027re all role models. They are blazing trails. I couldn\u0027t be prouder of them. So, the \"baton\" that I pass to all of you is their stories, their example.CommentsSamara WolpeStudent, Milken Community High School in Los AngelesI was nine-years-old. It was a pretty ordinary day. My mom came and got me from school, we walked in the door, I took off my backpack, and washed my hands. For some reason, my dad was home. And he was anxious.CommentsBarry LevinsonAcademy Award-winning director, screenwriter and producerThis Georgia law defies all logic. Is there a pent-up demand to carry guns into bars? Are Georgia residents complaining on a daily basis that they are being denied the right to carry their guns into a bar? I have to tell you, I have never met a person who lamented that they can\u0027t carry a gun into a bar.Comments (62)Chris Weigant, 2014.26.03MJ Rosenberg, 2014.26.03Ramaa Reddy Raghavan, 2014.26.03Andy Plesser, 2014.26.03Rabbi Robyn Fryer Bodzin, 2014.26.03Andrew Woodman, 2014.26.03Daniel Wagner, 2014.26.03Daoud Kuttab, 2014.26.03Vicki Cobb, 2014.26.03Bernard-Henri Lévy, 2014.26.03Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"PUTIN POSITIONS 30,000 AT UKRAINE BORDER",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
