{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Christian leader for social changeSacrifices will have to be made to put us on a path to fiscal responsibility and sustainability. But making those who are most vulnerable sacrifice the most is morally unacceptable. We need a bipartisan commitment to protect the poor and vulnerable in the fiscal decisions the nation is about to make. The mutual decision to protect the poor and vulnerable would provide the higher ground for a bipartisan commitment to finding common ground for the common good. And that principle would need to be tested by real policy choices that protect the sufficiency of a real safety net in tough economic times, help lift low-income families and children out of poverty, and save lives through effective international assistance around the world. That kind of common cause and common commitment would be a positive and important sign for the health of our nation\u0027s political and moral future.Read Post | Comments (336)Eric Whitacre, 11/23/12ComposerOur virtual family celebrates together, we mourn together, but through it all we are singing, connecting with each other in a way that only singing allows.

To stuff or not to stuff... To brine or not to brine... Yes, you can fast-cook a turkey at high-heat but should you? I think we all have debate fatigue; election fatigue; Washington gridlock fatigue -- and it\u0027s all somehow spilled over into Thanksgiving.Read Post | Comments (72)Arianna Huffington, 11/21/12How do we change things and give ourselves the gift of mastering our stress instead of being slaves to it?

Woodley, 11/22/12Distinguished Associate Professor of Faith and Culture, Director of Intercultural and Indigenous Studies, George Fox SeminaryMany of my fellow Native Americans who view the holiday as a national day of mourning, will not celebrate Thanksgiving at all.
