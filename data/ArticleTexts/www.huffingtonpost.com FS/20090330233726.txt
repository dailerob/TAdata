{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOI\u0027m delighted that today we are launching a new venture -- The Huffington Post Investigative Fund. This nonprofit Fund will produce a wide-range of investigative journalism created by both staff reporters and freelance writers. As the newspaper industry continues to contract, one of the most commonly voiced fears is that investigative journalism will be among the victims of the scaleback. And, indeed, many newspapers are drastically reducing their investigative teams. Yet, given the multiple crises we are living through, investigative journalism is all the more important. As a result, all who recognize the indispensable role good journalism plays in our democracy are looking for ways to preserve it during this transitional period for the media. For too long, whether it\u0027s coverage of the war in Iraq or the economic meltdown, we\u0027ve had too many autopsies and not enough biopsies. The HuffFund is our attempt to change this.I\u0027m guest hosting CNBC\u0027s Squawk Box Tuesday morning and I\u0027d love your suggestions, which you can put in the comments to this post.Read Post | CommentsBIOHenry Blodget, 03.30.2009Columnist and blogger on investing, the Internet, and financial marketsEach of the financial institutions that Geithner is desperate to bail out has tens or hundreds of billions of dollars that could be used to cover losses before the taxpayer had to cough up a dime.Read Post | CommentsBIOJeffrey Feldman, 03.30.2009Author of Framing The Debate, Founder of Frameshop (frameshopisopen.com)Fear and anger are rising in Michigan.
