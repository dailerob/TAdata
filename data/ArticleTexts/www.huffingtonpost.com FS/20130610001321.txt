{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week, in the midst of revelations that the NSA has been secretly collecting vast amounts of information on us, and just before yet another middling jobs report was released, President Obama visited North Carolina as part of a \"Middle Class Jobs and Opportunities Tour.\" Though the middle class continues to get pummeled -- with family wealth declining almost 30 percent in the last decade -- the White House brings up the issue only sporadically. It pops up, gets a few lines in a speech, then disappears again. The administration\u0027s meandering approach is like when an old person wanders into the kitchen and can\u0027t remember why: \"Now what did I come in here for? Oh yeah, that\u0027s right -- some yogurt... and the middle class!\" Maybe the president would be motivated to bring some sustained urgency to this crisis if the conversations the NSA is busy collecting were between America\u0027s 22 million unemployed and underemployed.Comments (232)Kirk DouglasActorPeople take their movie heroes very seriously. I often played the good cowboy on screen, riding in to save the day. Now, everybody thinks he is a cowboy too. That frightens me.Comments (2,681)Chelsea ClintonBoard member, Clinton FoundationNow, Cambodia is uniquely placed to be one of the first countries to eliminate new pediatric HIV infections, and through collaborative partnerships, I have no doubt Cambodia will be able to reach its goal.Comments (69)Gary HartPresident, Hart International, Ltd.It is one thing for senior members of Congress to say, about complex defense questions, \"I trust the experts.\" It is quite another thing for presidents to do so. It is impossible to be a competent commander in chief, as required by the Constitution, without preparing for that role.Comments (296)Arianna HuffingtonWhat we need is a more humane and more sustainable definition of success that includes well-being, wisdom, wonder, empathy, and the ability to give back. And women will have to lead the way.Comments (267)David BromwichProfessor of Literature, Yale UniversityThe security policy of the U.S. government from Cheney to Obama has passed from secret surveillance of communications abroad to secret surveillance of all communications at home. In what stages did it happen? Some day the history will be written; for now, it is instructive to rehearse the facts.Comments (593)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundWhat if we looked at violence in America as a public health crisis rather than a crime problem? What if we look for promising practices and expanded the ones that work to eliminate the epidemic of violence that keeps our graveyards, jails, and prisons full?Comments (339)David BlaineIllusionistLearning to hold my breath for 17 minutes was an exciting challenge, but here, there was no block of ice, or coffin lid, or even a deck of cards separating me from the crowd.Comments (244)Mariska HargitayAdvocate; Emmy Award-winning actress, \u0027Law \u0026 Order: SVU\u0027; Founder and President, Joyful Heart FoundationDespite the progress we as a nation have made in the movement to end sexual violence, including the recent passage of a more inclusive Violence Against Women Act, much work remains to be done.Comments (160)Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOThere is one thing worse than addressing a problem with imperfect solutions. It is not addressing the problem when better solutions are available. Yet this is what seems to happen every month in reaction to the highly watched employment report.Comments (295)Anne-Marie SlaughterBert G. Kerstetter \u002766 University Professor of Politics and International Affairs, Princeton UniversityThe ability to operate effectively in a horizontal web of relationships (a network of networks) is more important than ever. So why is it that the metric of success is still \"getting to the top\"?Comments (110)Kerry KennedyPresident, Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human RightsToday, as well as being the 45th anniversary of the day we lost my father, Robert Kennedy, is the 47th anniversary of his speech to student activists in South Africa that has come to be known as the \"Ripple of Hope speech.\"CommentsMichael MooreOscar- and Emmy-winning directorThis past week, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) posted on their website a list of what they believe are some of the best movie theaters in the world. And listed as #1 is the historic State Theatre of Traverse City, Mich., an incredible movie palace.Comments (74)Emily VanCampActressToday, on this World Environment Day, a day that celebrates all the courageous and positive environmental actions taking place around the world, I stop to reflect on what being an environmentalist means to me.CommentsStingComposer, singer, actor and activistFor nearly three years, I\u0027ve been working on a new musical play called The Last Ship. The inspiration for it really stemmed from my album The Soul Cages that I wrote in 1990, which depicted the landscape of my hometown, Wallsend, in the northeast of England.Comments (25)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarStriving for gender equality both in and out of the workplace doesn\u0027t mean women should be striving to emulate, \"overtake,\" or actually be men. Whatever women choose to do -- hug, kiss, handshake -- it\u0027s key to embrace the choice and approach the movement with confidence and ease.Comments (38)Mark CubanOwner, Dallas Mavericks; Chairman, AXS TVTV manufacturers are making YouTube a core part of their application offerings. Their expectation is that YouTube will be a destination for video that will compete with traditional TV.CommentsGreta Van SusterenHost, Fox News\u0027 \u0027On the Record With Greta Van Susteren\u0027A new report today is about one IRS conference in Anaheim in 2010 that cost $4.1 million -- 4.1 million of your dollars to party! How could they possibly think it was OK to take your money to party? And don\u0027t tell me it was a conference; that is absurd!Comments (425)Danny GloverActorThe workers of South Africa have more freedom than the workers of Mississippi. As long as powerful corporations such as Nissan can use fear and threats to keep workers weak and without a voice, we will not be a land of opportunity for all.Comments (95)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistTyra Banks got called \"Lightbulb Head.\" Chris Colfer was stuffed into lockers. Rihanna was mocked for not being \"black enough.\" And as for Howard Stern, he had to go to judo school just to learn to defend himself. And all of them not only survived but thrived.Comments (251)Julian AssangeEditor-in-Chief and Founder, WikiLeaksThe defendant now, and for the next 12 weeks, is the United States. A runaway military whose misdeeds have been laid bare, and a secretive government at war with the public. They sit in the docks. We are called to serve as jurists. We must not turn away.Comments (1,059)Adrian GrenierActor, filmmaker and entrepreneurI want to welcome you to Wreckroom, a music space in the basement of my Brooklyn home dedicated to supporting emerging bands. I\u0027m calling it a music incubator with label services. Perhaps not unheard of, but we\u0027re different in that we require our bands to give back.CommentsSec. Kathleen SebeliusSecretary of Health and Human ServicesSmart policy can be instrumental in removing obstacles to innovation. And we\u0027re now seeing the same pattern play out across the health care system.Comments (37)Al GoreChairman, Generation Investment Management and The Climate Reality ProjectIt was with great sadness that I learned of the passing of my dear friend Senator Frank Lautenberg. A stalwart of the Senate, Frank\u0027s dedication to his country and his constituents was unparalleled.CommentsKristen BellActressThat great storytelling tradition is also what I love the most about country music. I feel like country music is the most stealth-storytelling genre today. So now I love being around so much great country music, treated like a queen at the CMT Music Awards.Comments (15)Sean PennAcademy Award-winning actor; Ambassador-at-Large for HaitiFive months have passed, more than 20 Bolivian government officials connected with the extortion network that first imprisoned Jacob Ostreicher have been arrested or are on the run, and yet Jacob remains a captive of the Bolivian judiciary.Comments (42)HRH The Prince of WalesHRH The Prince of WalesThere is a growing set of alarming problems which, if not addressed with real urgency, will severely affect nature\u0027s capacity to keep her life support systems running and thus guarantee the well-being of billions of people around the world.Comments (489)Desmond Tutu and Chen GuangchengAs we approach the 25th anniversary of Tiananmen Square, world leaders have the opportunity to distinguish themselves from leaders of the past who, for the sake of economic progress or in the name of \"national security,\" have turned a blind eye to atrocities committed by Chinese leaders against their own citizenry.Comments (69)Jen HatmakerSpeaker and authorWe are limping, limping across the finish line, folks. I tapped out somewhere in April, and at this point, it is a miracle my kids are still even going to school.Comments (939)Andrew M. CuomoGovernor of New YorkFor too long New York\u0027s laws have not properly protected women\u0027s rights. These are significant problems, and big issues to tackle. But in New York, that\u0027s what we have always done.Comments (122)Roger WatersMusician, singer and songwriter; founding member, Pink FloydYour great country stands at the gateway between East and West. Istanbul is legend in the history of civilization. Your resistance today may well be a turning point between all of us and a return to the Dark Ages.Comments (122)John Lundberg, 2013. 9.06Dr. Charles G.
