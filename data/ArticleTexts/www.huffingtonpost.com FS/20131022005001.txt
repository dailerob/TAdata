{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonI\u0027m delighted to announce Food For Thought, a new HuffPost section in partnership with Chipotle. As part of our site-wide focus on well-being and sustainability, Food For Thought will be examining our attitudes toward food, asking where our food comes from and how it\u0027s produced, because there are plenty of forces and special interests at work that would rather you not ask too many questions -- at great cost to our environment, our health, and the planet. We believe that it\u0027s important to consider not only the food in front of us -- on our plates, in our kitchens, in restaurants we patronize -- but to look closely at the many stages of food production and preparation that are often invisible to us.Comments (38)Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027America\u0027s very rich keep trying to start a movement among college students to blame senior citizens for the sorry state of the economy that kids will inherit. Specifically, the billionaires keep trying to scapegoat Social Security.Comments (969)Mark CrumpackerChief Marketing Officer, Chipotle Mexican GrillI\u0027ve made many visits to hog farms, dairy farms, chicken houses, cattle ranches, feedlots and even to sunflower harvests amid the bitter North Dakota winds. What I\u0027ve come to understand is that farmers are neither \"good\" nor \"bad.\" There is simply more than one way to do the right thing.CommentsRon CebikPsychotherapist and TeacherThe breakdown of government is not due to the failure of public policy or the conflicting policies of partisan factions in the body politic. It is due, to a great extent, to factors under the radar of both popular media and sophisticated or academic thinking.Comments (72)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarThe conversation quickly moved off of weight and healthy eating and the \"awareness of obesity\" Kang says she was trying to raise. Instead, many women -- moms in particular -- used the photo as evidence of Kang\u0027s shoddy dedication as a mother, as if tight abs leads to neglected children.Comments (180)Leo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersRepublicans can pummel their own party if they want to, but what\u0027s amazing is that 18 of them in the Senate and 144 in the House voted against restoring government services and paying America\u0027s debts.Comments (262)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorReflecting on the recent shutdown/debt ceiling debacle, the resolution of which is only a few months\u0027 respite until the same self-imposed deadlines reappear, you\u0027ve got to wonder: what\u0027s wrong with America?Comments (223)Kristin HackmanBloggerWho am I to argue against the romance of \"When a child is born, a mother is born?\" I get it. But the part they left off, the asterisk to this sweet quote, does the woman before the mother die when the mother is born? Where does she go?Comments (12)Sec. Kathleen SebeliusSecretary of Health and Human ServicesIt has been three weeks since the start of the new Health Insurance Marketplace, where Americans can find quality, affordable health coverage. The launch of the Marketplace website has been rocky but we are working tirelessly to make the online process better.Comments (17)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesNow that he has surrendered completely, withdrawing his appeal to the New Jersey Supreme Court, he can no longer tell gay marriage opponents that he fought the good fight, because he ran from the last major battle waving a white flag.Comments (31)Wendell PotterAuthor, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgWhat happened -- or didn\u0027t happen -- to make it the federal exchange so unworkable, at least for now? Here are four possible reasons for the current messCommentsMartha BurkMoney Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsBefore Domestic Violence Awareness Month is over, at least 20 more women, and some of their kids, will be fatally shot by abusers. Cause of death: lack of action in Congress.Comments (123)Dylan RatiganNew York Times Best-Selling author, entrepreneur and formerly the host of MSNBC\u0027s The Dylan Ratigan ShowWe need to be thankful for the lumbering old patriarch that is our current electoral finance and candidate selection process. It has guided us through many generations successfully. But the time has come to accept and collaborate on an updating of this system.Comments (17)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027The problem is that the Democrats still seem to accept the Republicans\u0027 parameters for the budget debate. The implication is that current deficits are a serious problem.CommentsSen. Barbara BoxerU.S. Senator from California; Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works CommitteeHow much more pain and uncertainty do Americans have to endure before Congress decides that it should pay the bills it has racked up? Businesses and families must always pay their bills and so must Congress.CommentsIan GoldinDirector of the Oxford Martin School at Oxford UniversityThe growing financial debt, rising carbon emissions, dwindling natural resources and the escalating burden of chronic disease all have the potential to leave unsolvable problems for the next generation if we fail to act on the scientific bases that show clearly the difficulties we are storing up.CommentsAlison CayneFounder, Haven’s KitchenIf food really is #trending, then we can use this as an opportunity to get serious about demanding better policies from our representatives. We can ride the momentum of the \"foodie\" wave and genuinely connect with the sources of our sustenance.CommentsRichard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureScandal-tainted megabank JPMorgan Chase is losing legal ground in the wake of its multi-year crime wave. But in the wake of its tentative $13 billion settlement with the federal government, it may be on the verge of winning at least one battle -- in the court of public opinion.CommentsTueNightYou, Part Two.My husband would make the world\u0027s greatest father. But that alone isn\u0027t reason enough for me to become the mother I\u0027ve never wanted to be, take on crushing financial burden or add more to my already too-full plate.Comments (179)David BrockFounder, Media Matters for AmericaThat Benghazi would remain at the forefront of the contentious American political conversation speaks less to any special circumstances of the attack, and more to the insidious nature of a Republican noise machine that has grown in size and decibels over the last four decades.CommentsLeisha Davison-YasolBlogger, cancerinmythirties.wordpress.comAre you kidding me? How on earth could a day where girls and women are encouraged to post and share photos of their braless breasts and to walk around with their nipples poking through their shirts be \"supportive\" for women who are living with or who have died from breast cancer?Comments (45)Ocean RobbinsAuthor, Speaker, www.foodrevolution.orgNobody knows what\u0027s going to happen in Washington between now and November 5. But from Mexico, to Hawaii and to the 64 nations that already have GMO labeling, this tide just might be turning.Comments (470)Andrew MillerJournalist and book editorRoberts says his mere presence will give LGBT Russians hope. How convenient that his \"activism\" comes with a big fat paycheck. That\u0027s not courageous journalism. That\u0027s shameless opportunism.CommentsRobin InceComedian, actor, writerThe preposterously rich, whether wealth is gained through bailouts, off shore accountancy, or selling what isn\u0027t really theirs to sell, are deserving, they\u0027ve worked hard to ensure scams and thievery is governmentally sanctioned for the few.Comments (26)Don TapscottAdvisor to government and business leaders; Author, \u0027Macrowikinomics\u0027The solution might be to have the U.S. and Canada come together to form one country where the assets of each and the process of a merger might fix some intractable challenges they both face. This is the thesis of best-selling author and dual citizen of the U.S. and Canada, Diane Francis.CommentsWilliam AstoreWriter, Professor, Retired Lt. Colonel, Air ForceIn the halls of Congress and the Pentagon, it\u0027s business as usual, if your definition of \"business\" is the power and profits you get from constantly preparing for and prosecuting wars around the world.Comments (115)Anna SzymanskiWriterHumans, both male and female, have always had physical preferences, but heterosexual young men suddenly feel that it\u0027s socially acceptable to voice these predilections to the women lying naked beside them.Comments (200)Eden LaneTelevision journalist and producer, homemaker, wife and mother; host, \u0027In Focus With Eden Lane\u0027My hope was that, by addressing questions raised about my past, I could move beyond initial curiosity and keep the focus on my work. It was also an opportunity to uphold my responsibility to LGBT youth. At least that is what I hoped would be the result. Was that naive?Comments (19)Ethan RomeExecutive Director, Health Care for America NowAmerica\u0027s leading conservative think tank has issued a report on health care premiums under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and it bears a strong resemblance to the immigration study -- it\u0027s garbage.Comments (20)Mike LuxCo-Founder, Democracy PartnersBig bank executives are finally starting to sweat. Having gotten away for many years with relatively tiny, slap-on-the-wrist fines where they got exemption from any future legal action, a big $13 billion fine with no criminal side settlement is a different ballgame entirely.Comments (15)Will AllenAuthor, CEO of Growing PowerNothing about our current food system is inevitable. Fast-food companies have the opportunity to shake their bad reputation if they think anew. Our young black men and women are suffering from a health crisis, and fast-food chains have a responsibility not to profit off of their misfortune.CommentsBill Moyers and Michael WinshipIf you want to see how grossly money can distort democracy, just go to the state of Virginia, where there are no limits on how big a check can be written for statewide office. Groups and individuals from outside the Old Dominion are taking full advantage.CommentsFood Riot, 2013.21.10Robert Quigley, MD, D.Phil., 2013.21.10InternationalLiving.com, 2013.21.10Marisa Churchill, 2013.21.10Chris Weigant, 2013.21.10Kim Keating, 2013.21.10Louis Virtel, 2013.21.10William G.
