{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Lincoln Mitchelllincolnmitchell.comRussia\u0027s invasion of Ukraine has set off paroxysms of frustration, anger and incredulity in the West, not least in Washington. Some policymakers and pundits are struggling with ways to constructively address the problems raised by Russian action, others struggle to ensure that somehow President Obama is blamed for these events, and many are trying to figure out the complexity, context and background of these events. Understanding the conflict in Crimea, and the best way forward for the US, requires holding several, conflicting, and often unappealing, ideas in one\u0027s head at the same time. These are four of the most important of these ideas.Comments (74)Lori LeibovichExecutive Lifestyle Editor, The Huffington PostIt hurts to do my job, lift my daughter, carry grocery bags, or make it through the day without popping Advils. The message my body is sending is clear: Stop typing, tapping and scrolling, now.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorIt\u0027s of course tempting to decry the president\u0027s budget as \"dead on arrival\" but I wouldn\u0027t be nearly so quick to go there. Here are a number of ways that some of the ideas that the administration trotted out Tuesday will be referenced in months and even years to come.CommentsDonna SpragueMother, wife of military veteran, unemployed nurseWe are at a loss as to what we will do now that the unemployment has just run out. We live month to month. We really do not want to become homeless, but if something doesn\u0027t give, that is where we will end up, without even a vehicle to sleep in. In Ohio, in winter.Comments (243)Sandra Bond Chapman, Ph.D.Cognitive neuroscientist; Founder and Chief Director, Center for BrainHealth, University of Texas at DallasWith all the buzz about brain games -- such as crossword puzzles, Sudoku, and even brain training websites -- it begs the question: Can brain games be beneficial to brain health? As a cognitive neuroscientist, this is a question I get asked a lot. And the answer is yes and no.Comments (17)Trudie StylerActress, director, producer, and humanitarianIt is not my place, nor my expertise, to opine on the legal matters involved. I am nonetheless compelled, principally because of the suffering of humble, dignified people I have witnessed in Ecuador at the hands of an American company, to say that Chevron\u0027s legal and public relations tactics in this case constitute a grave injustice.CommentsRobert CreamerPolitical Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersIt\u0027s no wonder that Republicans have pinned all of their hopes for the mid-terms on the proposition that the botched Obamacare roll-out would sour the public on the signal accomplishment of President Obama\u0027s first term. But once again, the Republicans are on the wrong side of history.Comments (104)Larry CrandellVolunteer \u0026 RaconteurI\u0027m older than Scotch tape. And it was invented in 1930. I\u0027ve lived through the Great Depression and served in the Army Air Corps in World War II. At 90 and ¾, I only date women who like antiques.CommentsTracy SecklerCo-Founder and Executive Director, Charley’s FundMy advisors tell me to keep working the system, to keep the door cracked open by giving FDA officials opportunities to \"save face\" and encourage a new drug application for eteplirsen. But I cannot allow any more time to go by.CommentsJulien SmithCEO, Breather; Author; Voice actorYep, I finally did it. I read over a book a week all of the past year. More than that -- I never fell behind or stopped. I was always ahead of schedule for the entire year. So now, this coming year, guess what? I\u0027d like you to do the same. Here\u0027s how.CommentsAnatol LievenProfessor, journalist, and author of \u0027Ukraine and Russia: A Fraternal Rivalry\u0027It is urgently necessary that both Russia and the West find ways of withdrawing from some of the positions they have taken. Otherwise, the result could very easily be civil war, Russian invasion, the partition of Ukraine, and a conflict that will haunt Europe for generations to come.Comments (28)Claire FallonBooks Editor, The Huffington PostIn fiction as in life, many men seem great until they’re rejected or otherwise disappointed. Some fictional Nice Guys hide their darker sides effectively, while others are easily spotted as hypocrites.Comments (21)Michael VlahosWriter and National Security expertA restored realm could be a crown imperial, but it might also be a looser fraternal belonging: Yet to Russians it is still the irreducible proposition of identity. So when you ask: What is going to happen in Ukraine? What is Russia going to do? These are not questions -- they are answers.Comments (94)Stephen SchlesingerAuthor and Fellow at the Century FoundationIn both cases, the two leaders were dealing with secret, unexpected, armed missions launched by aggressive Russian leaders against Western interests, with little precedent in both cases on how to handle the crises.CommentsAmanda GuttermanSpecial projects at Huffington Post, writer of thingsI am making an exception and giving something up for Lent. That thing? Saying the R-word.CommentsSuzanne HeintzPerformance artist, photographer, satiristIt was getting late. Seriously late for a woman my age not to have a ring on her finger. People said, \"You\u0027re such a nice girl, why aren\u0027t you married?\" But then, I found a way. I bought a beautiful family... of mannequins.CommentsHerbert LuiMarketing Expert; AuthorIt\u0027s easy to get bogged down in unhappy memories. In the times we\u0027ve messed up, or the times we\u0027ve failed at something, and so on. Instead, create a Happiness Folder. It can contain anything that helps you rehearse the memories that you need to become happier in the long-term.CommentsKylah Goodfellow KlingeEditor and writerIt is the age when you accept that going through your 20s with too steely a resolve and determined a course would have made you much less interesting than you are today. It is where, unconsidered change behind you, you can see more clearly the grander choices ahead.CommentsAmb. Marc GinsbergFmr. U.S. Ambassador to Morocco \u0026 White House Middle East AdviserAt what point in time is Mr. Netanyahu going to end his rhetorical ropa dopa -- on the one hand claiming to want a diplomatic solution, yet kowtowing to the equivalent his own tea party equivalent?CommentsMichelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesSure, LGBT groups are operating within a political environment in which a small band of extremists have a lock on the GOP. But better to get nothing passed right now and continue to embarrass the GOP and watch it implode than to compromise our rights and pander to those extremists.Comments (18)Dr. Candi K. CannAssistant Professor, Baylor UniversityWith so much of our socializing done virtually, it is no surprise that we are grieving and mourning the deaths of our loved ones online too. Here are a few Dos and Don\u0027ts for grieving online.CommentsAnn ShoketEditor-in-Chief, SeventeenThe girls you see superglued to their phones aren\u0027t just distracted or self-involved, as teenagers are often dismissed as being. Those girls are creating their personal brands on Twitter, launching fashion careers on Tumblr and starting their own businesses on Etsy.CommentsElena Delle DonneWNBA Player, Chicago SkyI had been blessed with gifts that the world recognized: height, agility, coordination and strength.CommentsSusie MooreLife Coach, New York CityOur mind is a very powerful tool, and the impact of our thoughts and words cannot be underestimated. Confident people have greater control over their minds and have tuned their mental station to one of \"I can.\"CommentsPeter WeissPresident Emeritus, Lawyers Committee on Nuclear PolicyIf psychosis is a loss of contact with reality, the current status of nuclear disarmament can best be described as psychotic. U.S. policy on nuclear disarmament is at best a mixed bag; that of the other eight nuclear armed powers is not much better.CommentsMelanie NotkinFounder and national bestselling author of Savvy Auntie. Author, Otherhood, March 4, 2014,To be single and 42 in New York is at once exhilarating and depressing, empowering and debilitating. It\u0027s everything you\u0027ve ever wanted it to be and nothing you\u0027d ever imagined, all at the same time.Comments (66)Amitai EtzioniProfessor of international relations, George Washington UniversityThe digital revolution is increasingly allowing computers and machines, made smarter through software, to replace many of the better-paying jobs, namely those that require skills and are associated with the middle class. A telling example is what is beginning to take place in higher education by the introduction of MOOCs.CommentsPeter WattsWriter and presenterSarah Palin, James Bond, and Austin Powers walk into a bar. What they do in the rest of the joke is anybody\u0027s guess, but what they might do is raise a toast to the darned clever writers who created their catchphrases.CommentsChris MarvinManaging Director, Got Your 6As a veteran and as an American, I was appalled at this rash generalization that substance abuse is a known problem among veterans. Why does our current culture and news media insist on highlighting the worst about veterans?CommentsSara MilesAuthorWhy would anyone say \"thank you\" when a stranger tells you you\u0027re going to die? Because it\u0027s the truth.Comments (17)Bob CescaManaging Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowThe Republican battle against the Affordable Care Act just can\u0027t catch a break. First, the website is repaired and currently runs quite well. Then their Obamacare horror stories turn out to be bogus, and Boehner basically gave up on trying to repeal the law. And now, this.Comments (150)Mike Quigley, 2014. 5.03Evie Hantzopoulos, 2014. 5.03Andrea Mazzarino, 2014. 5.03Suzanne Heintz, 2014. 5.03Chris Komisarjevsky, 2014. 5.03Monica Engebretson, 2014. 5.03Sue Scheff, 2014. 5.03Mitch Kellaway, 2014. 5.03Hulu.com, 2014. 5.03Wenonah Hauter, 2014. 5.03Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"HE WON\u0027T BUDGE!",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
