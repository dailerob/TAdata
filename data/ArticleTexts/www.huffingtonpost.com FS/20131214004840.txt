{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Josh SugarmannExecutive director, Violence Policy CenterMuch will be said in the coming days about how successful advocates have been in achieving their goals since 12/14. And make no mistake: Given the opposition we face, we cannot expect to win overnight. The NRA, a trade association for the gun industry masquerading as a shooting sports foundation, has worked for decades to block any policy that could negatively affect the industry\u0027s bottom line. They\u0027ve taken tens of millions of dollars in donations from gun companies that care more about increased profits than protecting public safety. But over the long term, it\u0027s important to know that the NRA represents an industry on the decline. Newtown and other recent mass shootings have greatly increased public awareness of gun violence, helping spur a growing grassroots movement in favor of action that shows no sign of slowing down.Comments (120)TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"What if you could spend your summers swimming with dolphins in turquoise seas?

Last week a judge ruled that Detroit could move forward with its plan to cut pensions for retired city workers. This week Washington is celebrating a budget deal which harms older people economically in several ways.Comments (191)David RockDirector, NeuroLeadership InstituteResearch is beginning to have us question where we put our attention as a society, questioning what we should care about. If we want to avoid any kind of derailing, perhaps it\u0027s time we all paid more attention to sleep.CommentsBishop Mariann Edgar Budde and Bishop Ian T. DouglasIt is long past time to pass legislation that will expand background checks and other modest measures that will save lives and assuage even a small portion of the grief caused by gun violence that has become a staple of our pastoral duties and our prayers.Comments (23)Tony NewmanDirector of Media Relations, Drug Policy AllianceHere we go again.

MurphyDirector, ACLU Washington Legislative OfficeInnocent Americans should never have to worry their government\u0027s awesome surveillance capabilities are intercepting, filtering, collecting, analyzing, and storing the intimate details of their lives. Appallingly, they do.Comments (11)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundOne year later, despite Congress\u0027s appalling lack of action, there has been important progress in some areas and states. The White House has quietly delivered on most of the executive actions President Obama promised in the aftermath of the Newtown shooting.CommentsRabbi Yehoshua SoudakoffDirector, Jewish Deaf MultimediaAs a Deaf person myself, I was taken aback at the fact that at one of the most significant world events in recent times, a phony interpreter was chosen to represent the Deaf community. It serves as a message to the Deaf community that the world still does not understand us.CommentsCon SlobodchikoffAuthorIf we abandon the old paradigm that we are intrinsically different and superior to all other life forms, it\u0027s possible to look at animals with greater respect and, like Denise Herzing, start working towards decoding their language.CommentsJonathon OwenCopy editor and language writerMy last post, \"12 Mistakes Nearly Everyone Who Writes about Grammar Mistakes Makes,\" drew a lot of comments, some supportive and some critical.

KucinichFmr. 16-year Member of US Congress; Two-time US Presidential CandidateIn a country where the average monthly minimum wage stands at about $150 USD, it\u0027s not hard to understand why Ukrainians are in the streets. But is their plight being exploited to usher in a new military agreement under the guise of economic reform?Comments (23)Jonathan KimGentleman farmer, film critic for ReThink Reviews and the Uprising ShowIt\u0027s hard to believe that David O. Russell\u0027s first feature film was an incest comedy called Spanking the Monkey. Now, with his track record of critically-acclaimed dramedies, he has his pick of Hollywood\u0027s A-list talent, some of whom reached that level because of him.CommentsJim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027Congress ends its December session today, and we will break down the tent.
