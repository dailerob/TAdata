{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOSo now McCain wants to delay the debates so he can focus on the economic crisis. If what we\u0027ve seen from the senator so far is him \"focusing\" on the economy -- what the hell is he like when he\u0027s multitasking? One thing is for sure. Expecting a workable solution to this economic meltdown from a man as knee-jerk, dishonest and incomprehensible as John McCain would be an exercise in national self-destruction. He doesn\u0027t have anything real to say, and what he does say, he can\u0027t sell. He simply can\u0027t do the gig.Read Post | CommentsBIOSteve Clemons, 09.24.2008What is shocking about the presentation by Bush -- and the deal that is unfolding is that we don\u0027t see any acceptance of responsibility for the failure of his team\u0027s stewardship of the economy.Read Post | Comments (87)BIOJon Soltz, 09.24.2008Unfortunately, insurgents in Iraq don\u0027t stop shooting at us, or setting IEDs, because our Commander in Chief needs a breather to figure out Wall Street.Read Post | Comments (81)BIORobert Kuttner, 09.24.2008If Paulson\u0027s arrogant tactic of demanding instant action because of impending catastrophe sounds vaguely familiar, it\u0027s because it evokes how the same Bush administration rushed through the Patriot Act.Read Post | Comments (22)BIORobert L. Borosage, 09.24.2008Look out folks, the fix may be in. Here\u0027s what it might look like: President issues grave alarm. Leaders of both parties promise a bill by the weekend. Sparked by Buffett, Wall Street organizes full court press. We get steamrolled.Read Post | Comments (94)BIOJacob Heilbrunn, 09.24.2008Neither McCain nor Obama are the prime movers in the Senate on the issue of a bailout. Their job is to fight for the presidency, and it\u0027s one that Obama is winning right now.Read Post | Comments (17)BIOHoward Bragman, 09.24.2008The issue of the economy is not going away between now and Election Day. Clinton 2000 taught us, \"It\u0027s the economy stupid.\" McCain should have been listening -- Barack Obama was.Read Post | CommentsBIONico Pitney, 09.24.2008Bush was able to debate Kerry while he was president. For all of his sudden urgency, McCain acknowledged just yesterday that he had not even read the administration\u0027s three-page bailout proposal.Read Post | Comments (1076)BIORJ Eskow, 09.24.2008McCain\u0027s election-year flipflops and gimmicks -- including the \"time out\" -- should be treated no differently than any salesman\u0027s attempt to confuse you into making a bad deal.Read Post | CommentsBIOBart Motes, 09.24.2008McCain\u0027s appeal is a cynical move based on a genuine economic crisis. Not the economic crisis in Washington -- the financial crisis is in McCain\u0027s campaign.Read Post | Comments (35)BIOAndy Borowitz, 09.24.2008\"As of today, I am officially bailing out of the debate,\" Sen. McCain told reporters in Washington today. \"And I invite Sen. Obama to join me in this bailout effort.\"Read Post | CommentsBIOSeth Grahame-Smith, 09.24.2008Lincoln ran for office during the Civil War. Reagan ran at the height of the Cold War. Bush ran with two wars raging in Afghanistan and Iraq. But McCain can\u0027t run during a crisis on Wall Street?Read Post | Comments (157)BIOMax Bergmann, 09.24.2008One thing is clear from McCain\u0027s latest campaign stunt: when confronted with bad news McCain\u0027s first instinct is to react hysterically. His leadership of his campaign has been anything but stable.Read Post | Comments (14)James P. Rubin, 09.24.2008Jed Lewison, 09.24.2008Max Blumenthal, 09.24.2008Alexis C. Jolly, 09.24.2008Rep.
