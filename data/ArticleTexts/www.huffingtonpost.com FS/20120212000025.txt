El-Erian, 2/10/12CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOFor the sake of both current and future generations, let us hope that Clint Eastwood\u0027s \"Half Time in America\" commercial will be remembered for more than just igniting yet another round of political bickering and finger pointing.Read Post | Comments (243)Trita Parsi, 2/10/12President, National Iranian American CouncilIt is lack of political courage that has permitted this looming confrontation. Only courage and will can bring us out of it. The question is whether Obama can muster that will in an election year when any compromise is bound to be cast by Republicans as a betrayal of Israel.Read Post | Comments (686)Michael Moore, 2/11/12Oscar and Emmy-winning directorOn this day 25 years ago, in 1987, I became a filmmaker. I had no idea on that morning in Flint, Mich. what my life would be like after that, or what would happen to Flint, or to General Motors.Read Post | Comments (12)Bill McKibben, 2/11/12Author of a dozen books, including \u0027The End of Nature\u0027 and \u0027Deep Economy\u0027We\u0027ve been to jail, we\u0027ve marched on Washington; this week it\u0027s pixels and keystrokes.

If it is to be salvaged, both sides will need to change course and pay attention to the concerns of their respective publics, both of whom now hold negative views of each other.Read Post | Comments (23)Kenneth R. Miller, 2/10/12Professor of biology, Brown UniversityOur Darwin problem is really a science problem. The easier it becomes to depict the scientific enterprise as a special interest immersed in the culture wars, the easier it becomes to reject scientific findings. We see this everywhere in American culture and politics today.Read Post | Comments (943)Marian Wright Edelman, 2/10/12President, Children\u0027s Defense FundLast year more Americans relied on food stamps to eat than at any time since the program began in 1939 -- 46 million.

Yoffie, 2/10/12Outgoing President, Union for Reform JudaismJefferson Bethke\u0027s video, \"Why I Hate Religion, but Love Jesus,\" has been viewed by more than 18 million people.
