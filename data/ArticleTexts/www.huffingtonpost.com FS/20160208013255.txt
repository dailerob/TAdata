{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week the nation\u0027s attention swung from Iowa to New Hampshire. But even though votes have now actually been cast, the media\u0027s attention stayed focused on the polls. Even though the overblown oracles missed the mark in Iowa, the pundit class breathlessly pivoted, without even an iota of self-reflection, to touting the newest polls in New Hampshire. We\u0027ve allowed polls to establish the baseline of our political debate, making everything about expectations. And this despite the fact that the polls\u0027 ability to forecast elections is clearly waning, as more and more people refuse to respond. How about in addition to publishing sample size, the dates the poll was taken, etc., they also publish response rates? There are plenty of problems in our political process, but one is the gap between the importance we assign to polls and how little scrutiny we give them. We could fix it, but first, breaking news about a new South Carolina poll!Bernie Sanders\u0027 campaign has already accomplished what most observers thought was impossible.

Cut taxes for the rich. Make the poor drink toxic river water. And everybody\u0027s happy. Except those who were poisoned in the process. All 102,000 of them. In the richest country in the world.Oscar and Emmy-winning DirectorKat Duff is the award-winning author of The Alchemy of Illness and The Secret Life of Sleep, which both set out to illuminate experiences often dismissed as private and off limits.

The crisis at FIFA is a crisis of leadership.FIFA presidential candidateWhile progress is possible, it is not inevitable. If we\u0027re going to keep the promise we made in 2012, it\u0027s time to step up and get to work.Co-chair, the Bill and Melinda Gates FoundationOf course candidates have to deny that they listen to Wall Street, and flatter voters into thinking ordinary people\u0027s opinions about high finance and economic fairness really matter. But of course most candidates also suppose that ordinary people don\u0027t understand banking and that bankers do.Professor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027The Federal Housing Finance Agency and DOJ have obtained more than $36 billion in fines from 18 major financial institutions, including banks like JP Morgan and Bank of America.

Even more dangerous, though, is that she is the candidate of the military-industrial complex. The idea that she is bad on the corporate issues but good on national security has it wrong.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia UniversityWe must embrace these children after their traumatic experiences and tell them: \"You are a loved human being who\u0027s worthy in our society, who has rights to freedom and liberty, and to being valued for mind, body, and soul.\"ActressThis election, as we\u0027ve all heard, is dominated by angry white people. That is because the primary system is fundamentally racist. The first two presidential contests occur in states whose populations are 92 percent and 94 percent white, respectively.Author, \u0027Public Parts\u0027 and \u0027What Would Google Do?\u0027When it comes to mental illness, the problem isn\u0027t how we describe those who suffer but how we as individuals ultimately choose to view them, which is just that: a choice. Instead of renaming the conversation, how about reframing the entire body of thought around the topic?Author, research psychologist and gender scholarA week and a half ago, just as a blizzard was barreling up the East Coast, I traveled to my hometown, Canandaigua, NY, and before a standing-room-only audience of more than 400 at Finger Lakes Community College, had a conversation with author and climate activist Naomi Klein.Senior writer, BillMoyers.com.

They clearly didn\u0027t think that an obscure 74-year-old democratic socialist from Vermont would be a real challenge. But he is.Director, USC Annenberg Innovation LabHillary Clinton is not the first progressive Democratic woman to be challenged by Bernie Sanders.
