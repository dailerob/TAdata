{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"From news.yahoo.comIllegal warrantless wiretapping -- and the administration\u0027s unrelenting mendacity about it -- is not only wrong on principle but a perfect wedge issue for Democrats. But only if they correctly frame the issue. So far, the Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee have adopted a strong tone with Alberto Gonzales. But Democrats have an ignominious recent history of coming out of the gate hard, then quickly sounding retreat as soon as the White House cries \"soft on defense!\" This time, they need to stay on the offensive, making the case every chance they can that our national security is being undercut by Bush\u0027s lawbreaking and lies.READ POST | comments (143)02.07.2006 Patt MorrisonIt\u0027s wonderful that Attorney General Alberto Gonzales has a lively imagination, and more wonderful still that he shared it with United States Senators.READ POST | comments (13)02.07.2006 Hooman MajdOur government has done a fine job of convincing the world that it\u0027s cautiously pursuing diplomacy with Iran, but in doing so has set the stage for a military confrontation \"at the time of its choosing.\"READ POST | comments02.07.2006 Michael StandaertI have to think a lot of this has been blown way out of proportion by the more fundamentalist elements within the Islamic faith. Crude satires that they were, the right to create them should be defended.READ POST | comments (21)02.07.2006 Trey EllisThe nation is a gas-guzzling Hummer that Bush has driven off the road into a muddy ditch. It\u0027s not enough to sit in the backseat and carp about his bad driving.READ POST | comments (12)02.07.2006 Jonah PerettiThe Contagious Festival is in full swing but it is still far from clear who will win the People\u0027s Choice Award. Right now a rapping ostrich is in the lead, and a spoof on wire tapping is a strong second.READ POST | comments02.07.2006 Bob CescaYou should know that electronic communication didn\u0027t exist during Washington\u0027s presidency. Neither did electric power. Or a war. Thought I\u0027d save you the embarrassment. Especially you IT professionals.READ POST | comments (60)02.07.2006 Robert SchlesingerBy citing the terrorist reaction, Alberto Gonzales implicitly validates it. The al Qaeda operatives are shaking their little evil-doer heads, he\u0027s saying, and they\u0027re right -- this display is weakening us.READ POST | comments (21)02.07.2006 Susan SmalleyWe suffer from a blindness of sorts, a blindness perhaps best described by \u0027blinders\u0027, blinders that narrow our view of ourselves and the world around us. Blinders that generally disappear with age.READ POST | comments02.07.2006 Danielle CrittendenKickass43: condi\u0027s like: that\u0027s not a good idea rite now sir.

So how come so few are willing to show us what the furor over the Danish cartoons is all about?READ POST | comments (25)02.06.2006 Norman SolomonThe Bush administration\u0027s game plan on Iran is a time-honored scam: When you\u0027re moving toward aggressive military action, emphasize diplomacy.READ POST | comments (28)02.07.2006 Laurie DavidDoes anyone else find it ironic that President Bush is now calling for more science education when his administration has worked overtime altering scientific reports and muzzling science advisors on issues such as global warming?READ POST | comments (33)02.07.2006 Joe FontaineTim Russert, thank you for taking time to address my concerns during your visit to Ripon College. But you have still not addressed many other questions regarding your involvement in the case.READ POST | comments02.06.2006 Katrina vanden HeuvelSecretary of Defense Donald \"Stuff Happens\" Rumsfeld will visit the Council on Foreign Relations to talk about \"New Realities in the Media Age.\" Whose \"new realities\" will Rumsfeld talk about?READ POST | comments (17)02.06.2006 Cenk UygurThere isn\u0027t a country in the world I would less like to have a nuclear weapon than Iran. But if you thought Muslims worldwide were pissed about a cartoon, wait till you see them after we invade another Muslim country.READ POST | comments (70)02.06.2006 RJ EskowToday\u0027s right wants to strip the nation of all its resources -- natural, financial, and moral -- for personal gain. And they\u0027re well on their way. Why shouldn\u0027t Democrats dedicate themselves to a truly conservative set of goals?READ POST | comments (16)02.06.2006 Tom D\u0027AntoniWith so many thousands of Gods watching our every move, no wonder the world is in such a pickle.
