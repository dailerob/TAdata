The encouraging part of the second number, the unemployment rate, is less obvious. Normally, higher unemployment is bad news, and people seeing HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT on the evening news tonight will naturally assume the worst. But this time, unemployment actually rose for a good reason.Could you be cousins with Barack Obama? What about Gwyneth Paltrow or Albert Einstein? It\u0027s entirely possible.

If you work in an office, time is pretty flexy. If a meeting can benefit by running an extra 10 or 15 minutes, you just do it. But in most schools, when the bell rings, you\u0027re done.

Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorIt\u0027s not really the number or rate of executive orders, however, that Obama has issued that has raised the hackles of the GOP. It\u0027s the executive orders that he has issued that have given the GOP ammunition to attempt to intimidate and politically bash Obama.Author and political analystMy other concern about the working women discourse is the notion of having it all. All what exactly? The discussion in this space often seems to limit, rather than expand, the definition of success. And with a narrow definition of success, we inadvertently limit women\u0027s choices.Executive Vice President, Office of the CEO; Founding Advocate, Widen the CircleThe first step when it comes to identity theft is admitting you have a problem.
