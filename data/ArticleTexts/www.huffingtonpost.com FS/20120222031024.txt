{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"With unemployment still over 8 percent, we currently have more ingenuity, energy, and expertise than we have jobs -- and definitely more time on our hands. That\u0027s one reason I was so drawn to Abundance, a new book by Peter Diamandis and Steven Kotler. It arrives in a world facing multiple crises and awash in pessimism. Arguing, as Diamandis and Kotler do, that the world is getting steadily, demonstrably better carries multiple hazards: of tone-deafness; of giving short shrift to suffering, corruption, and the parts of the world -- including many parts of America -- that are in steady, demonstrable decline. But Abundance is not a work of Pollyannaism. The portraits of brilliant and empathetic minds at work improving the human condition are not an excuse to ignore the many areas in which our leaders are failing us. Rather, they are a reminder of the possibility of doing good by tapping into our collective intelligence and wisdom.Read Post | Comments (21)Michael Kieschnick, 02/21/12President, CREDO MobileIn recent weeks, the nation has talked more about contraception than at any other time during my 58 years of life.
