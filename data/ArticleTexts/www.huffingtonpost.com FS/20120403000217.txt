{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"The FCC, which is supposed to make sure television broadcasters don\u0027t completely get away with highway or, rather, airwave robbery has proposed that stations post on the web the names of the billionaires and front organizations -- many of them super PACs -- paying for campaign ads. It\u0027s simplicity itself: give citizens access online to find out quickly and directly who\u0027s buying our elections. Hardly an unreasonable request, given how much cash the broadcasters make from their free use of the airwaves. But the broadcasting industry\u0027s response has been a simple, declarative \"Not on your life!\" It would cost too much money, they claim.Read Post | Comments (28)Wendell Potter, 04/02/12Analyst at MSNBC and the Center for Public IntegritySince Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia clearly isn\u0027t going to take the time to actually read the health care reform law before he decides whether or not it\u0027s constitutional, maybe he can catch a screening of The Hunger Games.Read Post | Comments (786)Alex Castellanos, 04/02/12Republican media consultantIn the Grand Old Party, we see moral standards as necessary but humbling measures of our imperfections, revealing how far and how often we fall short.

And it particularly preys upon people with lower incomes -- who assume they can\u0027t make it big any other way, who often find it hardest to assess the odds, and whose families can least afford to lose the money. Yet America is now opening the floodgates.Read Post | Comments (13)John R.
