{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Mark GongloffChief financial writer, The Huffington PostThursday\u0027s rout was the resumption of one that started about a month ago, but has picked up speed lately, sending investors scurrying for safe havens like Treasury bonds. The Nasdaq has lost about 7 percent in that time, led by former high-flying stocks like Facebook, Google and Tesla. The big debate now is whether this is The Big One, the long-awaited correction to a bull market that has been carrying on with only minor interruptions since March 2009. Or maybe something worse, something crash-ier. Or maybe it\u0027s just temporary agita about the Federal Reserve\u0027s long-stated desire to stop pumping quite so much cocaine into the financial system, along with the start of corporate-earnings season, which is not expected to be very good.He tweeted from the International Space Station. Now astronaut Chris Hadfield tells the amazing story of going blind in space. Then he covers David Bowie, just because.TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"I have been asked about Miley Cyrus a handful of times during my travels abroad. I am often asked if I know someone named \"John\" who also lives in New York City. But the only question I have been asked on every coast of every country I\u0027ve visited is: \"Why do Americans love guns so much?\"Joanna ZelmanFront page editor, The Huffington PostSo if you\u0027re in the midst of changing passwords, now\u0027s a good time to start a password system, rather than picking one new, universal password.Adam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911\"Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\" are so fundamental to our well-being that our forefathers included these values in the Declaration of Independence. So, shouldn\u0027t it be obvious how to achieve that third value, happiness? Not in my experience.Hervé LarrenFounder, BidKindIf a network chose to place a woman behind the desk of a late night show, there would be an opportunity to do something both historic and radical -- suggest that the voice of a female comedian is as relevant as that of her male counterpart.Ann marie HoughtailingAuthor, founder, Millionaire Girls\u0027 MovementIf I ever get a job where I\u0027m paid a living wage, I will probably still volunteer at both the food pantry and thrift shop because the work they are doing really helps people, and nobody knows that better than I do.Stephanie S. BrooksNew Hampshire residentYou\u0027d think that that public television would support public education, but you\u0027d be wrong. The Public Broadcasting System (PBS) has gotten in bed with the billionaires and conservatives who want to privatize our public schools.Peter DreierE.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeWatching the search for Malaysian Flight 300, with its tragic loss of 239 passengers and crew, got me thinking about a broader dynamic that exists in all of us around the world.Matthew DowdPolitical strategistHere at Harvard, where students have big dreams and an abundance of resources, it can be difficult to allow ourselves the time to put away our devices and relax. In the spirit of Arianna\u0027s visit to campus, I interviewed Harvard students on how they \"thrive.\"Eva ShangEditor-at-Large, Harvard UniversityWe hope to use this toolkit to convince HR directors, caterers, hotel chains, event planners, and some of our gracious bosses that it\u0027s easy to put together a satisfying and delicious meal or snack that won\u0027t undermine the health of their employees and guests.Michael F. JacobsonExecutive Director, Center for Science in the Public InterestPaul Kagame has used his impressive achievements, (and the continuing guilt of the West) to mount a sophisticated International PR campaign to counter the accusations that he is a ruthless dictator.Terry GeorgeOscar winning filmmakerWhile much has been researched and written over the years about America\u0027s gender pay gap, I want to instead discuss how you can act if you learn that you are, in fact, being paid less than your male colleague at work.Kim KeatingFounder and managing director, Keating AdvisorsImmigration reform is not just an economic issue -- although it plays a big role in attracting and retaining talented people who will contribute to our economy. Commonsense immigration reform -- as Boston\u0027s Cardinal Sean O\u0027Malley affirmed -- is part of a consistent ethic in which all of life is treated as sacred.Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersI\u0027ve had the pleasure of watching, as a parent -- removed, but still very close -- the entrepreneurial spirit in action. And it\u0027s given me a much clearer view of what it takes to launch a business, and even what it means to be able to create something from nothing in that way.Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarBut I do have issues with being in a country of over 300 million people who are not all white, who don\u0027t all live in -- or near -- Manhattan, who are not all college educated, and who are not all males. But you never would know that if you\u0027re relied on the executives from NBC and CBS.Jamie MasadaOwner, The Laugh FactoryThe problem with the naysaying and finger pointing is not only that it is wrong, but the single-mind blaming of Israel for the breakdown of talks reinforces an atmosphere that makes moving forward toward any kind of peace or understanding more unlikely.Abraham H. FoxmanNational Director, Anti-Defamation LeagueMany people speak about keeping the anonymity of their children intact by leaving their names and photos out of articles they write, but with the technology available now, how much is that impeding the information being readily available to employers and college admissions officers?Jamie KrugWriter, SAHM, CMO - Chief Medical Officer (of my family), Wife, Blogger at Our Stroke of LuckLast week, as part of the reopening of the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis, I moderated three panels of civil rights advocates who reflected on early efforts to pass civil rights legislation, promises fulfilled and progress not yet made.Tavis SmileyPBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorFor the past two days, 22-year-old Mary McCoy has been mercilessly mocked and ridiculed by what feels like the entire internet -- and she says she\u0027s loving it.Dan LyonsMarketing fellow at HubSpot and creator of \u0027The Secret Diary of Steve Jobs\u0027NATO should be getting the message. Someone in Brussels should be ordering a big cake, compiling the festschrift, preparing golden parachutes for the top brass, and getting the \"mission accomplished\" banner printed up.John FefferCo-director, Foreign Policy In FocusWe often mistake the artificial chemical and psychological thrill of fake edges for the real. In fact we often seek them out as a substitute for the reality of change, growth and exploration. Our minds and bodies help us in this, as they react much the same to this simulations as to the real world. Thus we scream in horror movies or amusement park rides and get a rush from blowing up the bad guys in video games.Rick TumlinsonFounder, Deep Space Industries, EarthLight Foundation, Space Frontier Foundation, Orbital Outfitters Inc.The world seems like it will never be equal for men and women because of how society perceives gender roles. Nonetheless, there are people working to change how people look at things, and you can feel the industry really shifting.Cindy HoangCoder, high school studentThere comes a time where I think everyone (even the most famous) needs to reevaluate their regime, and reassess what is -- and isn\u0027t -- working for them.Napoleon PerdisMakeup artistI\u0027ve wasted a truly incredible amount of time in that lazy space that exists between kinda working and kinda screwing around.

It is also probably more nefarious.Lincoln Mitchelllincolnmitchell.comHere\u0027s a story that resonates with so many layers of bitter irony that it\u0027s hard to know where to begin. So we\u0027ll start with the headline: \"Citi Foundation to Help Teens Find \u0027Pathways to Progress.\u0027\"Richard (RJ) EskowSenior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourFirst, don\u0027t panic. This is a serious problem but you need to put it into perspective. While there is clearly a vulnerability, there are so far no reports of the flaw being exploited. And even though this flaw has been around for the past two years, almost all the major sites have fixed it -- in some cases, in the last few days.Larry MagidTechnology journalistOur society loves success, but even more we love failure. Infrequently do we admire, or even talk about, what happens in between.Michael Brooks Jr.CTO and Co-Founder @Spire; UX/UI Designer; Soccer playerThere is a small space between experiencing something in our lives and reacting to it.
