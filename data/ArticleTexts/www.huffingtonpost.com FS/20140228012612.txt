{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonAhn-nyong-ha-seh-yo from Seoul. I\u0027m here for the launch of HuffPost Korea, which marks the 11th country where The Huffington Post\u0027s hybrid approach to journalism -- as a hub for original reporting and a blogging platform for a range of voices, both new and established -- is expanding the worldwide conversation. And we\u0027re very excited to be partnering with a great media company, the Hankyoreh Media Group. At the very moment that Korea is facing slowed-down economic growth and the unintended consequences of the rapid growth of the past, there is a growing recognition that there has to be a new path forward that will allow Koreans to tap into their creativity and ability to innovate while reducing the cost of stress on their workforce. HuffPost Korea will be using all the tools at our disposal to tell these stories -- and just as important, to help Koreans tell their stories themselves.CommentsAdam WinklerProfessor of Law, UCLAWednesday marked the defeat of Arizona\u0027s \"Beau Crow\" law -- a modern-day version of Jim Crow that would have given state endorsement to discrimination against gay and lesbian people. Yet LGBT discrimination by private businesses remains lawful, in both Arizona and most states.CommentsMark GongloffChief financial writer, The Huffington PostWhen you read that story recently about the Burger King customers who were insulted on their order receipt, you may have felt shock, outrage and sympathy for the customers. I felt a little of that, but something else, too: I felt empathy for the employee who typed up the receipt and then got fired over it.Comments (33)Gordon BrownFormer Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationThe education challenges in Nigeria are real and many. There is a teacher shortage of nearly 1.3 million, basic infrastructure is lacking and there is a shortfall of up to 1.2 million classrooms. There are fewer children in school each year due to child marriages and gender and religious biases and education is simply too costly for the poor.CommentsMichelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesLet\u0027s not forget that in Arizona, it\u0027s still legal to refuse to serve lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in your bakery or your photo studio for religious or any other reasons, due in no small part to Jan Brewer\u0027s hostility to LGBT rights throughout her tenure.Comments (30)Mina SohnEditor-at-large, HuffPost KoreaHuffPost Korea will, above all, change the tone of existing news and suggest measures to recognize problems and improve them cheerfully and intelligently. Breaking social prejudice and dissolving journalistic hierarchies, it intends to convey the reader the \"real\" news of life in which all of us are the hosts and main characters.CommentsCecile RichardsPresident of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, \u0026 Planned Parenthood VotesIt\u0027s clear that this bill isn\u0027t about religious liberties. It\u0027s about corporations who want a license to discriminate against people by denying services, taking away birth control coverage, and blocking access to health care. If Governor Jan Brewer can see that this is way too extreme, surely the U.S. Supreme Court can, too.CommentsBeth LeybaCommunity activist, writer, student, momI am somebody. I have value. I am working, even if it\u0027s barely enough to get by. I will simply keep doing the best I can for my children, and I will continue feeding homeless youth even as I struggle to put food on my own table.Comments (14)Dr. Michael J. BreusClinical Psychologist; Board Certified Sleep SpecialistBad dreams and nightmares are among the most startling and emotionally potent of remembered dreams. Even a partially remembered disturbing dream can linger in our waking minds. But what do we know about this phenomenon of disturbed dreaming? And what\u0027s the difference between a bad dream and a nightmare?CommentsKaren J. GreenbergDirector, Center on National Security at Fordham Law SchoolIn his first weeks in office, in a series of executive orders and public statements, the new president broadcast for all to hear the five commandments by which life in his new world of national security would be lived. Five years later, the question is: How have he and his administration lived up to these self-proclaimed commandments?CommentsAllen FrancesProfessor Emeritus, Duke UniversityThe media have adopted a new and dangerous convention. People who are radical in their goals and methods are routinely mislabeled \u0027conservative.\u0027 Edmund Burke, the patron saint of real conservatism, must be spinning in his grave when Sarah Palin is called \u0027conservative.\u0027CommentsJosh StearnsPress Freedom Campaign Director at Free PressAs the spaces and places in which we publish, speak and assemble grow more connected, the geography of freedom is in flux. We\u0027ll need to draw new maps, and forge new paths, and fight new battles to protect our rights online and off.CommentsNatalie Singer-VelushSeattle mom of two and Managing Editor, ParentMap MagazineOnce you have children and a mortgage and a puppy that just had to come home with you for Christmas and jobs and a bottomless fridge that is never well-enough stocked no matter how many times you go to the grocery store, marriage changes.Comments (17)Scott DannemillerWriter, blogger, worship leader and former missionary with the Presbyterian ChurchWhen I say that my material fortune is the result of God\u0027s blessing, it reduces The Almighty to some sort of sky-bound, wish-granting fairy who spends his days randomly bestowing cars and cash upon his followers.Comments (20)Rep. Alan GraysonU.S. Congressman for Florida\u0027s 9th DistrictThere are plenty of reasons to be against the Keystone XL pipeline. Environmentalists recognize it as the ultimate \"bonfire of the vanities\" -- planet-wide carbon bonfires. Here is another reason, perhaps the best reason of all: It doesn\u0027t do us any good. China, yes. The Koch Brothers (who own the refining capacity that would be used), yes. Us, no.CommentsTasha ReignAdult EntertainerWe have to fight to provide a strong, positive voice for sex workers worldwide. Knowledge is power, and while sexuality is controversial, we need to fight for our freedoms as women to express ourselves and put slut-shame to an end.Comments (15)Paul LamereDirector of Developer Platform, The Echo NestJust as different regions like to eat different foods, they prefer different music, too. Yes, people everywhere listen to Jay-Z, Macklemore, and Daft Punk -- it\u0027s just that some artists are played far more in certain parts of the country than in others.CommentsValerie JarrettSenior Advisor to the President and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsThe fraction of young men not working or enrolled in school is nearly twice as high for blacks than whites. Those neither working nor in school are not building the skills and experience needed to ensure their ability to succeed later in life.CommentsBob CescaManaging Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowReligious people clearly have the right to practice their own religion, but they\u0027re not allowed to discriminate against people because of who they are. This isn\u0027t a matter of \"No Shirt, No Shoes, No Dice,\" it\u0027s a matter of constructing a second class of citizens whose choices would be limited because of who they love.Comments (283)Craig GieseckeChef, writer and former journalistAs the White House prepares its budget proposals for the coming fiscal year and the House prepares to reject them, millions of older Americans who have lost their jobs, their unemployment, and in many cases their houses, are holding out little hope of much relief.CommentsChris WeigantPolitical writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comWhat follows is a modern-day parable. I think it\u0027s important to point that out up front, in order not to cause any undue offense. The scene: the near future, when Arizona (or any other state, for that matter) becomes a bastion of religious freedom by passing laws shielding businesses from penalty for discrimination on the basis of religious belief.Comments (123)Lincoln Mitchelllincolnmitchell.comIn the last two months, income inequality has quietly fallen out of its brief prominent place in the public debate and discussion. It still mentioned by some economists and some progressive pundits, but something has changed.Comments (32)Kristine EsserFreelance writer and digital marketing professionalI like men and women. There is no question in my mind. Honestly, I find it hard to sometimes see how you could only be attracted to one sex.Comments (14)Robert L. BorosagePresident, Institute for America\u0027s FutureRemember the Republican promises about comprehensive tax reform? A flatter, simple tax code. Lower rates, paid for by closing loopholes. Well, never mind.CommentsRaluca StateHere are a few key friendships that every woman should have. The ones that will lift her up and help her fall and be there for a laugh when nothing else seems to work.CommentsBobby SteggertBroadway, Film and Television ActorThe young me who sat in fear watching that talk show over 20 years ago begins to recede, and he is overshadowed by a man who is beginning to believe that he deserves happiness.CommentsAdam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911While access to credit enables us to carry these kinds of debts, they hurt our ability to gain more access to credit - so the big-screen television you buy today could well be the one thing that prevents you from getting a mortgage on the perfect house next year.CommentsDylan RatiganNew York Times Best-Selling author, entrepreneur and formerly the host of MSNBC\u0027s The Dylan Ratigan ShowThe 21st Century Renaissance is dependent on individuals proactively making a difference. It has been an inspiration for me to meet seemingly ordinary people making remarkable impacts on their communities.CommentsChez PazienzaCo-host, \u0027The Bubble Genius Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027; writer, Deus Ex MalcontentWhether you\u0027re familiar with Firefly or not, if you follow political outrage you probably know that actor Adam Baldwin recently drew a really ridiculous comparison.CommentsNatasha AshtonCo-Founder and Chief Marketing Officer, PetplanWhether a furry friend costs $1 or $1,000, our pets are always priceless to us. To keep your dog\u0027s paws where they belong (with you!), here are some tips for thwarting thieves.CommentsDan GlickmanSenior Fellow at the Bipartisan Policy CenterA burgeoning body of research is pointing to the importance of the first few years of life for influencing long-term health, including an individual\u0027s weight as an adult.CommentsPatrick O\u0027Connor, 2014.27.02Courtney McKinney, 2014.27.02Jon Wortmann, 2014.27.02Gregory S.
