{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressSo the word is out! The GOP field for the 2012 nomination looks set for the time being. And the enthusiasm is pretty much not palpable at all. But for what it\u0027s worth, the Obama team seems to be expecting to face a serious challenge, perhaps because the economy will continue to remain sluggish. But that\u0027s looking far ahead. Today, right-leaning pundits feel about the same way they felt about the field last week: let down and hoping for a white knight to emerge. Given the vagaries of the GOP nominating process, this is a hope that will be kept alive through the fall.Read Post | CommentsJared Bernstein, 05.25.2011Senior Fellow, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesI\u0027ve been pretty aghast to hear claims that large cuts would immediately generate job growth when the opposite is almost surely the case. You can make this a lot more complicated, but when you\u0027re as far below capacity as we are it\u0027s really quite simple arithmetic.Read Post | CommentsMarlo Thomas, 05.25.2011Award-winning actress, author and activistFor all the walls we thought we\u0027d broken down with Free to Be -- and all the stereotypes we thought we\u0027d shattered -- children today are not free to be anything they want to be, and they are dying for it.Read Post | CommentsTrey Ellis, 05.25.2011Novelist, Screenwriter, and Associate Professor at Columbia UniversityIt\u0027s not class warfare for the government to protect all of its citizens from financial exploitation. It is what we assumed our government was there for in the first place. An Elizabeth Warren appointment would deliver this message forcefully.Read Post | CommentsDylan Ratigan, 05.25.2011Host of MSNBC\u0027s “The Dylan Ratigan Show”If you look at Barack Obama\u0027s transition website, or listen to his 2008 campaign rhetoric, you\u0027ll find a host of now broken promises. Is it a surprise that some of his most ardent former supporters are now angry?Read Post | CommentsJohann Hari, 05.25.2011Columnist, the London IndependentEcuador\u0027s government says that if the rest of the world offers just half of what the oil beneath their rainforest is worth -- $3.5 billion -- they will keep the rainforest standing and alive and working for us all.Read Post | CommentsArianna Huffington, 05.24.2011In times of economic stress, there is a tendency to look for the cause of problems in some identifiable \"other\" group, race, religion or country. But perhaps Pogo had it right: \"We have met the enemy and he is us.\"Read Post | CommentsRuth Bettelheim, Ph.D., 05.25.2011Psychotherapist, Marriage and Family Counselor, Edcuation Consultant, Life Coach, WriterHistory -- and the scenes flooding our TV sets today -- vividly illustrate that preparations for housing victims of large-scale disasters are critically lacking, even here in the US. But there is really no good reason for this.Read Post | CommentsSigourney Weaver, 05.25.2011Academy Award nominated actressI keep thinking about Rachel Carson these days, because the current efforts to discredit climate scientists look a lot like the powerful resistance that met Carson\u0027s warnings about DDT.Read Post | CommentsCarolyn Maloney, 05.25.2011U.S. Representative from New YorkIt is beyond ironic that after years of grossly misleading Republican TV ads about \"death panels,\" \"government takeovers\" and other nonsense, the Republicans are now complaining about a Democratic candidate who simply tells the truth.Read Post | CommentsRobert Reich, 05.25.2011Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Aftershock\u0027Paul Ryan still doesn\u0027t get it. He blames Tuesday\u0027s upset victory of Democrat Kathy Hochul over Republican Jane Corwin to represent NY-26 on Democratic scare tactics. Scare tactics? Seniors have every right to be scared of Ryan\u0027s plan.Read Post | CommentsErel Margalit, 05.25.2011Israeli venture capitalist and social entrepreneur; Candidate, Labor Party ChairmanTime and again, leaders are faced with crucial and difficult decisions. Mr. President, now is one of those times. We, as part of a new generation of leaders, must project our vision for how the nations of the Middle East can be built and rebuilt.Read Post | CommentsTherese Borchard, 05.25.2011Author of the blog, Beyond Blue, on Beliefnet.comBefore Prozac and Zoloft, music was my sole therapy. And I\u0027m not alone: the website of the American Music Therapy Association lists 57 pages of research articles chronicling the successful use of music to treat a host of different illnesses.Read Post | CommentsRep. Louise Slaughter, 05.25.2011U.S. Congresswoman from New York\u0027s 28th DistrictWhen our nation\u0027s laws allow a troubled individual to purchase a gun, but can\u0027t hold that same person responsible for their actions, then it is clearer than ever that we need to act.Read Post | CommentsAngel Gurría, 05.25.2011Secretary-General, OECDWe could be forgiven for wondering if we have learned anything over the past few years. We would deserve less forgiveness if we were unwittingly preparing the ground for the next slump and no one sounded the alarm.Read Post | CommentsRep. Dana Rohrabacher, 05.25.2011U.S. Congressman from California\u0027s 46th DistrictIn the name of harmonizing our laws with other countries, Congress is about to dramatically diminish the patent protections offered to American innovators over the history of our Republic.Read Post | CommentsAndy Ostroy, 05.25.2011Political \u0026 pop culture analystIf Democrats were smart, they\u0027d co-opt Kathy Hochul\u0027s winning strategy and aggressively run with it nationally all the way to November 2012. The GOP\u0027s attack on Medicare is the absolute perfect bumper-sticker issue for them.Read Post | CommentsSen. Ron Wyden and Sen. Mark Udall, 05.25.2011Members of Congress are about to vote to extend the most controversial provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act for four more years, even though few of them understand how those provisions are being interpreted and applied.Read Post | CommentsUna LaMarche, 05.25.2011Editor of \u0027The Sassy Curmudgeon\u0027Wow, guys, can you believe we made it to the season finale? The most exciting thing about this episode is that Rosie gestates and gives birth to a baby in less than 50 minutes. Talk about efficiency.Read Post | CommentsDaphne Eviatar, 05.25.2011Senior Associate, Human Rights First’s Law and Security ProgramAs House Republicans continue to press for new and expanded war authority, the White House has issued a rare threat to veto any legislation that would needlessly expand the war on terror.Read Post | CommentsErin Gibson, 05.25.2011Comedian, Writer and host of Infomania\u0027 Modern Lady on Current TVRead Post | CommentsRichard B. Woodward, 05.25.2011Arts Critic in New YorkMale politicians have never been celebrated for their fidelity to their wives or their general propriety with women.

They, unlike our own election-cycle worshiping rulers, think through where they want their country to be 100 years from now. This is why China is busy economically colonizing Africa and is making fools of us in AfghanistanRead Post | CommentsLincoln Mitchell, 05.25.2011Harriman Institute, Columbia UniversityShould Mitt Romney, as is increasingly likely, win the GOP presidential nomination, it will be a severe defeat for the Tea Party faction of the party.Read Post | CommentsRobert Scheer, 05.25.2011Editor of Truthdig.com, Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027Perhaps the main value of the book and film versions of Andrew Ross Sorkin\u0027s Too Big to Fail is the instruction they provide on the limits of mainstream journalism in the decade that led up to the meltdown.Read Post | CommentsRaymond Schillinger, 05.25.2011Online Media Strategist, Documentary FilmmakerAll the fast cutaways and lens flares can\u0027t hide the fact that this video still feels utterly artificial. Big bucks were no doubt spent to make 2012\u0027s most uninteresting candidate seem like a protagonist in a Spielberg epic.Read Post | CommentsChris Weigant, 2011.05.25Martin Varsavsky, 2011.05.25Johann Hari, 2011.05.25Lubomir Kavalek, 2011.05.25Vivian Glyck, 2011.05.25ARTINFO, 2011.05.25Jesse Levine, 2011.05.25Arie Kruglanski, 2011.05.25Shira Lazar, 2011.05.25Nicole Skibola, 2011.05.25","h1":"Using a mobile device?
