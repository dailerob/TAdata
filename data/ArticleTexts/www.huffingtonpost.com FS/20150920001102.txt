{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersIn the GOP debate, Jeb Bush made the outrageous statement that his brother George W. Bush \"Kept us safe.\" Here is a news flash for Jeb: Bush did not begin his term on September 12, 2001. The worst attack on American soil since Pearl Harbor occurred on his watch. And it occurred after he had ignored intelligence warnings before 9/11. It is outrageous that the Bush crowd would have the audacity to say they \"kept us safe\" after presiding over the 9/11 debacle and the inept, ineffective, ideologically driven response that followed. The best ways to keep America safe are never to forget just what George W. Bush did to America and to keep Jeb Bush and the entire Bush gang a \"safe\" distance away from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and the levers of political power.Sanders\u0027 candidacy has created a moment of truth for Democratic voters, testing how serious they are about changing the country\u0027s direction. We cannot be certain that even a President Sanders could loosen Big Money\u0027s stranglehold on our democracy. But we can be certain that neither of his rivals would even try.Jeff Faux, author of The Servant EconomyLet\u0027s end this pointless complaining and channel our energies into every facet of what it takes to win: registering people to vote, pushing out our message, raising money, and organizing and coordinating our efforts within this great big tent we call the Democratic Party.Mayor of Philadelphia, PAThis week\u0027s Republican debate featured a number of whoppers that never received the media scrutiny they deserved because an examination of the debate was soon overshadowed wall-to wall coverage of a bigoted question Donald Trump was asked by a supporter at a New Hampshire rally.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Something sneaking up on everyone in the political world is the surprising amount of GOP candidates who are open to ending a massive tax break for hedge fund managers. President Obama has noticed, and is pointing it out.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comWhen you land on the Greek islands, the last thing you expect is to be surrounded by thousands of people living in cardboard boxes and tents. However, that\u0027s just what I saw when I landed in Lesvos, Greece - a small island of 85,000 that has almost 20,000 refugees, now living on the streets, \"stuck\" on its island.Humanitarian and former Foreign Service officerSexual assault is a tragedy with the potential for long-term medical, psychological, and emotional consequences. Victims of sexual assault who feel that their physician and staff are genuinely concerned and kind are far more likely to return for follow-up visits, seek counseling as well as treatment.Board Certified Family Physician, \"Tha Hip Hop Doc\"The U.S. electorate may well be anti-war, in the sense of not wanting U.S. boots on the ground overseas. But that doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s actively pro-peace. Between these positions, Clinton has pitched her tent of \"smart power.\"Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogAmerica looks to her government and sees not themselves reflected in what Congress does, but someone else. They see not a Congress bending over backwards to answer the calls of average voters. They see a Congress bending over backwards to make calls to their funders. And who could really blame them?Law professor, activist, candidate in the Democratic Primary for PresidentI\u0027m deeply concerned about America\u0027s young black generation, because if it were not for people who gave me support to be okay with an identity that has nothing to do with looking like or imitating a destructive life, I might mimicked negative stereotypes of violence shown in the media.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundAfter a half century of progress, thanks in large measure to Planned Parenthood, some Republicans seem determined to try to march us backwards - and seem determined to make a circus out of trying to shut down the organization.U.S. Representative for New York\u0027s 12th District; Ranking Democrat, Joint Economic CommitteeHis muted volume shrouds pronouncements which, in both their strangeness and self-certainty, are stunning even by Trumpian standards. For little in Dr. Carson\u0027s campaign thus far suggests the slightest awareness of the feeble qualifications, rhetorical excess, and monumental self-regard he brings to his pursuit of the presidency.Author, political commentatorAm I the only Republican who remembers Ronald Reagan\u0027s 11th Commandment: Thou shalt not speak ill of any fellow Republican? Undoubtedly I\u0027m not, but the people running for the party\u0027s presidential nomination seem to be suffering from collective amnesia as they turn the campaign into a slugfest.Co-founder and former CEO, WWE; 2012 Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in ConnecticutThe caliber of people who now talk to me on the site are... problematic at best. Most people who message me now fall into one of these categories: The Ghost, The Gross, and The Saviour.Artist. Model. Freedom Fighter.Being gay at my HBCU is a bittersweet experience for me. Since birth I was raised with the mentality to be \"The Man.\" I was taught to not pursue anything that \"threatened\" my masculinity. Coming out wasn\u0027t an easy road, but in retrospect I wouldn\u0027t change a thing.Broadcast Journalism Student at Hampton UniversityWhat is the reason Republicans have become the party of anti-intellectuals? The danger is that it may drown out any intelligent discourse about the most important issues of our day. It\u0027s driving at least one of our political parties into insanely ridiculous positions, at the moment.Editor and Publisher, PopularEconomics.comThe same day the Messiah endorsed Sanders, media and politicos focused only on Kanye West\u0027s official decision to run. Yes, he\u0027s running folks, and he\u0027s serious.Columnist published in The Cleveland Plain Dealer, The Baltimore Sun, The Hill, Salon, The Jerusalem Post www.hagoodman.comBy any reasonable standard of what constitutes acceptable public discourse, Donald Trump\u0027s presidential campaign should have ended on Wednesday at about 10:50 p.m. That\u0027s when he set his extravagantly sprayed hair on fire by indulging in some truly dangerous myths about vaccines.Associate professor, School of Journalism, Northeastern University; author, \u0027The Wired City\u0027Our goal is to create a rallying cry that moves every American to step up and realize that the responsibility to prevent sexual assault begins with each of us. To end it requires a change in culture that demands everyone\u0027s engagement.Senior Advisor to the President and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsIslamophobia, and probably racism, certainly played a role in Ahmed\u0027s ordeal, but the fact is overzealous administrators, zero-tolerance policies, and law enforcement officers ill-equipped to deal with schoolchildren have compromised educational environments throughout the country.Executive Director, ACLU of TexasIt\u0027s a given that to be a Republican candidate you have to bash President Obama as being weak on defense. But as evidenced in Wednesday\u0027s debate, while a few of the candidates depart from the party\u0027s most heated foreign policy rhetoric, none of them have come up with a coherent alternative.Director, Arms and Security Project, Center for International PolicyDonald Trump may be a big blowhard, espousing his belief that there\u0027s a link between vaccines and autism based on no medical facts. But with the bully pulpit he has, he can influence parents to not vaccinate their children and the price could be deadly.President \u0026 Editor-in-Chief, HollywoodLife.comThe Pope was a trusted broker in the behind-the-scenes negotiations that led to an official rapprochement between our two countries, so we\u0027re confident that he\u0027ll speak favorably about warming U.S.-Cuba relations on his trip.Associate, Engage CubaReally? Are we really still defending -- and celebrating! -- the idea that sexual orientation is akin to some deep dark secret to be discussed after dark behind closed doors in hushed tones with only our most trusted confidantes?Editorial Director, The Huffington Post VoicesYour zip code, ethnicity and bank balance shouldn\u0027t determine your health. The Kelly Report on Health Disparities in America puts us one step closer to balancing the scales and realizing the core mission of the CBC Health Braintrust: Achieving health equity in a generation.Congressional Black Caucus Health Braintrust Chair, health equity advocate, representative for Illinois\u0027 2nd District.In the Unetaneh Tokef prayer of 2015, we could easily add the phrases: \"who by bullet and who by negligence, who by semi-automatic weapon and who by unlicensed handgun, who by lack of background check and who by accident.\"Rabbi, Temple Sinai, Sharon, MA; Author, Witnesses to the One: the Spiritual History of the Sh\u0027ma (Jewish Lights)Imagine for a moment that the United States faced an existential threat. Variations of this scenario happen in summertime action movies all the time. Sadly this scale is not only seen in movies. Climate change is already an existential threat for many nations.Executive Director of US Climate Action Network (USCAN)Rather than engage in informative, fact-based, positive dialogue about vaccines, Dr. Carson and Dr. Paul did a disservice to science and research.Host of \"Dr. America\" on We Act Radio, pediatrician in Washington DC, member of the National Physicians AllianceIncreasing attacks against ordinary Kurds in the western part of Turkey risks the societal fragmentation of the country, which in turn would encourage political fragmentation and feed into the PKK\u0027s narrative as being the sole protector of the Kurds.Research Director, Al Sharq ForumFrom the beginning of his tenure as pope, Francis has used his position to change our conversations about what, and who, is important. In his words and his actions, he has challenged narratives and assumptions about the Catholic church, the world economic order, immigration, and the environment -- to name a few issues.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersDo I need the Wheaties box to feel fulfilled? Absolutely not! To simply be here, living my life as my true self is rewarding enough.
