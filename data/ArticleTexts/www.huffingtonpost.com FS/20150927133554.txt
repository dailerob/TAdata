{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, the nation was transfixed by the radical humility of Pope Francis. In the midst of an ugly campaign season already marked by xenophobia, scapegoating, and cruelty, this very different Pope brought a very different message. While addressing a joint session of Congress, and again at the United Nations, he urged leaders to see the humanity of those affected by their actions, or lack of action. They should view refugees \"as persons... trying to respond as best we can to their situation.\" He cited the Golden Rule, but expanded it for his Congressional audience, urging the politicians to \"seek for others the same possibilities which we seek for ourselves.\" At the UN he called for \"an examination of conscience,\" and asked that \"real human beings take precedence over partisan interests.\" It was a master class in true leadership, and the awesome power of humility. Let\u0027s hope the Pope\u0027s spirit lingers long after he leaves.The Chinese must understand that America would like to see a peaceful, prosperous, and free China and that we do not wish to undermine the rise of China. Similarly, Americans need to understand that China differs from the Soviet Union that we faced in the Cold War.39th President of the United StatesAs Palin demonstrated, even the ratings-crazed media are capable of falling out of love with a big-ratings stunt candidate. And when the media fall out of love they fall out of love very quickly.The SDGs are the result of the most open and transparent consultation process in the history of the United Nations. Millions of people shared their vision for a better world and what is needed to attain it. The result is truly the people\u0027s agenda.Secretary-General, United NationsHamilton is the single greatest musical ever produced. It has not only revolutionized the form, but it is the best history teacher I could ever want. It makes me want to be young again and able to see history through its eyes.Actress and children\u0027s book authorViolence can never engender peace. Still, I will always pray for the person who holds the weapon, pray that this person finds compassion and recognizes the humanity he or she shares with the person who may be at the other end of that weapon\u0027s sights.Archbishop Emeritus of Cape TownThe geopolitical aspects of the conflicts in the Middle East must not conceal such an enormous humanitarian tragedy, in the face of which the international community, and especially the United Nations, must no longer remain idle.President of BrazilIf you don\u0027t know about the water crisis, you should. 2.5 billion people are affected. They lack clean water and a toilet. Each day kids miss school, Moms walk miles and families get sick from unsafe water. And too many die.Actor and Co-founder, Water.orgIt is un-American and outrageous that special laws can deny us our day in court simply because we were victimized by the gun industry. Our lawsuit was not frivolous. Our Jessi was shot multiple times with high-velocity, armor-piercing bullets that were designed by our military to inflict maximum damage on enemy combatants.Parents of Aurora victim Jessica GhawiYet we too, messengers of peace, have a global force to be reckoned with. We live in an interconnected world. Our global village is more accessible and more informed than it has ever been.Former President of the State of IsraelIn accordance with its legal and moral duty, the United States should step up to the plate and welcome significant numbers of refugees.Professor, Thomas Jefferson School of LawNo one should be allowed to profit from putting more people behind bars -- whether they\u0027re inmates in jail or immigrants held in detention centers. In fact, I believe that private prisons shouldn\u0027t be allowed to exist at all, which is why I\u0027ve introduced legislation to eliminate them.Democratic candidate for President, US Senator from VermontPope Francis speaks out faithfully and forcefully against poverty and has been called \"the pope of the poor.\" But on his first visit to the United States there was demoralizing news about poverty, especially child poverty, in our nation -- the world\u0027s largest economy. Despite six years of economic recovery, children remain the poorest group in America.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundA just outlook would recognize that in many cases it is the communities who have done the least to deplete resources that are the most affected by the shortages.Actor and Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)Barring federal funding for Planned Parenthood, as some in Congress favor, would have a devastating impact on women\u0027s access to health care services through Medicaid -- especially family planning services -- and put many women\u0027s health at risk.Vice President for Health Policy, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesAs a Republican, I am utterly ashamed of my party. As a soldier for 31 years, I am disgusted with these \"courageous\" candidates, none of whom has served a day in the Infantry in their lives. As a citizen, I am deeply concerned for my country.Colonel, U.S. Army (Retired)If intellectual arguments cannot defeat the militaristic foreign policy paradigm (the one that justified preemptive wars and produced the Iraq fiasco), then perhaps religious appeals can. That\u0027s were Pope Francis comes in.President, National Iranian American CouncilWorking together, open governments and their citizens will harness the data revolution for sustainable development.President of MexicoCorporate lobbyists and their friends in the media spout free-market platitudes about why sky-high prices are necessary to promote innovation. It\u0027s time for a serious understanding of the policy issues.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia UniversityWhen new findings appear to reaffirm existing estimates, the tendency is to conclude that the survey was well done. To the contrary, experts have declared that the AAU survey is flawed, in concept, construction, and analyses.Professor of Public Health, University of ArizonaProfessor of Psychology and Associate Dean of the Honors College, Georgia State UniversityEmerita Professor of Psychology, University of North Carolina at GreensboroIt was a beautiful speech, full of heart for the least of these. However, I think we can lay to rest the idea that this is a pope that has no politics.Executive Editor Of Global Spirituality and Religion, The Huffington PostThe men and women of the world are once again disheartened to read yet another story about a black person being brutalized by the NYPD. We are also disheartened by the knee-jerk reaction from ivory tower police union bosses.Founder of Garner Way Foundation and daughter of Eric GarnerPolitical Director for Garner Way FoundationThe United States this past June did something that the Catholic Church and the Vatican have for years railed against: granted marriage equality to its gay and lesbian citizens. Yet, Pope Francis had nothing to say about it. Not then and not now.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostThe Club de Madrid welcomes the effort made by UN Members to prioritize inclusion, giving it much more relevance than in the previous Millennium Development Goals. We, nevertheless, continue to note the absence of a specific and direct reference in support of representative democracy.Former President, East Timor, 1996 Nobel Peace Prize laureateWe in the West aren\u0027t as freed up as we should be, but we also aren\u0027t as busy as we\u0027re constantly told.Executive Blog Editor, Huffington Post Media GroupIt is a universal message -- one that speaks to the challenges climate change is having on society and the environment and the role of individuals, civil society and institutions to address them.CEO, UnileverChairman of the Board and CEO of the Kellogg CompanyWe\u0027ll be inundated Pope, Pope, and more Pope 24-7 this week, as the pontiff makes his rounds in the nation\u0027s capital. Francis plans a White House visit, an outdoor mass in Washington, and a speech before Congress. He\u0027s also likely to join a rally on the National Mall.Money Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsWe often forget that the Greek problem is Europe\u0027s problem. The ongoing debt crisis proves this, and the chaos that the migration and refugee flows have unleashed emphasizes it.Editor in Chief, HuffPost GreeceIt takes a lot of courage to defy the folks who make tens of billions a year selling drugs. We will find out soon whether President Obama has the backbone to stand up to Merck, Pfizer, and the other major drug companies in order to protect the lives of millions.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027If I had a big huge red pen and could permanently strike five words from the Standard Veterinary Dialogue, it would be this: \"You\u0027ll know when it\u0027s time.\"author, veterinarian, and death fairyClimate change denial isn\u0027t actually about the science. It\u0027s about opposition to regulation. It is about science-denying front groups, industry shills, bought-and-sold politicians, and other bad faith actors who continue to provide cover for corporate polluters like ExxonMobil by fooling the public.Director of Penn State Earth System Science Center; Author of \u0027Dire Predictions\u0027 and \u0027The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars\u0027Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
