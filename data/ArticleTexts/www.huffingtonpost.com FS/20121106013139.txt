{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"We\u0027re in the calm between the storms. The one created by Mother Nature has passed; the man-made electoral storm is about to begin. But in the short window before the media goes All Election, All the Time, we should take a moment to ask some big questions. That\u0027s what I\u0027ve found myself doing over nearly a week of living by candlelight once the sun set. Why is it so difficult for us to look around the corner and prevent upcoming disasters, or at least mitigate their impact? Why does it take a disaster to bring out the best in us? Why can\u0027t we sustain that best-self spirit even after these storm-battered communities get back on their feet? In a few hours, we\u0027re going to get lots of results, but we shouldn\u0027t confuse them with answers. Those we\u0027ll have to keep looking for ourselves.Read Post | CommentsDean Baker, 11/05/12Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027When Gov. Romney gave his acceptance speech at the Republican convention he quipped that President Obama wants to slow the rise of the oceans and that he, by contrast, wanted to help American families. It would be interesting to see if Romney would care to repeat this line today.Read Post | Comments (35)Michael Smerconish, 11/04/12Radio hostI objected when George W. Bush was the subject of undeserved, hyperbolic criticism, but the baseless scorn heaped upon President Obama makes Bush\u0027s detractors look diplomatic. The president, the office, and our nation deserve better.Read Post | Comments (1,213)Helen C. Whitney and Gregory A. Prince, Ph.D., 11/03/12Is Romney the face of Mormonism? Or has he so far distanced himself from core values of his religion that Mormons feel constrained to emphasize that he is not that face?Read Post | Comments (2,104)Howard Fineman, 11/04/12Editorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupThe way both Mitt Romney and Barack Obama have campaigned this year makes me wonder. Is there something about the presidency -- or the pursuit of it -- that attacks the character of men and women under its spell?Read Post | Comments (588)Benjamin Todd Jealous, 11/05/12President and Chief Executive Officer of the NAACPTo date, nearly six million formerly-incarcerated Americans are disenfranchised. This is a massive injustice, to be sure, but the real story is that these felony disenfranchisement laws that target former offenders are being enforced in 2012 in key states where they were not in 2008.Read Post | Comments (16)Jim Wallis, 11/05/12Christian leader for social changeDuring this presidential campaign, we lament the way in which religious faith has been abused, manipulated and neglected in the heated, focus-group-tested sound bites that fill our airwaves and pass for \"substantive\" policy debates.Read Post | Comments (156)David Wild, 11/05/12TV Writer; Contributing Editor, Rolling Stone; Co-Author, \u0027Diary of a Player\"\u0027Here\u0027s my 2012 Election Day Playlist, with a few democratically selected suggestions from my followers of all political persuasions @Wildaboutmusic.Read Post | CommentsBeth Broderick, 11/04/12Actress, founding member of MOMENTUMWho would launch a hate campaign against an organization that provides clean safe drinking water to impoverished people in places like Swaziland?

The challenge -- not only for our president and representatives in Washington but for all of us -- is to rediscover the public good.Read Post | Comments (146)Dr. Michael J. Breus, 11/05/12Clinical Psychologist; Board Certified Sleep SpecialistOur culture says tiredness is to be ignored; it says the need for sleep is a weakness to be overcome if success is to be achieved. In many corners of the medical world, admitting to being tired is akin to admitting you\u0027re less than committed to your work.Read Post | Comments (45)Marty Kaplan, 11/04/12Director, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolI was against Chris Christie before I was for him. If Obama wins, when all the exit polling gets sorted through, it\u0027s those images of the Democratic president touring the hurricane damage arm-in-arm with the Republican governor that may turn out to have given him his advantage.Read Post | Comments (14)Michael Hogan and Christopher Rosen, 11/05/12Best Actress has nothing on Best Actor.

It is both horrific and unspeakable to see pro-gun activists advocating the same type of violence on our own soil.Read Post | Comments (763)Chris Weigant, 11/05/12Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comToday, we\u0027re just going to throw caution to the wind, and go ahead and predict the outcome of tomorrow night\u0027s returns.Read Post | CommentsDeepak Chopra, 11/05/12Author, \u0027God: A Story of Revelation\u0027; founder, The Chopra FoundationUnder the most trying conditions he has held the tide against disheartening reactionary opposition. It took character to do that without descending to the level of right-wing ideologues, for whom no tactic is too low.Read Post | CommentsJonathan Weiler, 11/05/12Director of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel HillThat one party goes to such lengths to keep people from voting should be a major national scandal and it\u0027s disgraceful that it\u0027s part of the landscape in which people vote in this country.Read Post | CommentsRobert Kuttner, 11/04/12Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The enormity of last week\u0027s super-storm is just beginning to sink into political consciousness. Hurricane Sandy should transform what Americans expect from their government, and give the party of government activism new force.Read Post | Comments (214)Danny Glover and Mike Farrell, 11/04/12the death penalty is broken beyond repair, and it\u0027s time to replace it with life in prison without the possibility of parole. We support Prop 34 -- and we encourage California voters to get the facts and vote YES on 34 on Tuesday.Read Post | Comments (259)Jamie McGonnigal, 11/05/12Founder, TalkAboutEquality.comTen-year-old Sophia penned a letter to Obama telling him how happy she is that he agrees with her on the topic of marriage equality. You see, young Sophia has two dads. Well, in the middle of his fight to be reelected, the president took some time to share a little advice with a little girl.Read Post | Comments (717)Joe Hansen, 11/05/12International President, United Food and Commercial Workers UnionOne candidate -- President Obama -- supports workers\u0027 rights and is committed to protecting them. The other -- Mitt Romney -- is out to destroy them. That\u0027s what at stake in this election.Read Post | CommentsFrances Beinecke, 11/05/12President, NRDC Action FundClimate change puts us all at risk -- the 47 percent, the 99 percent and the 1 percent -- whether our state is red or blue. We need a president who understands what\u0027s happening to our world and will act -- and has acted -- to address this grave and gathering threat.Read Post | Comments (29)Andrew Fieldhouse, 11/05/12Federal Budget Policy Analyst, Economic Policy Institute and The Century FoundationA grand bargain could successfully navigate the fiscal obstacle course only if it injects hundreds of billions of dollars of stimulative spending into the economy for years to come and delays government spending cuts until the economy emerges from depression.Read Post | Comments (21)Jennifer Rivera, 11/03/12Mezzo sopranoPlease don\u0027t just vote for someone because of how you think it will affect your wallet -- vote for someone who wants to improve your quality of life on many different levels.
