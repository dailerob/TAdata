{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressOne of the biggest debates in American politics involves the ideal size and role of government. Conservatives tend to favor a small federal government. Liberals more often contend that government should play a major part in our lives. Technocrats on all sides talk about the need for government to be, if nothing else, efficient. Everyone has their own opinion about when, exactly, the government crosses the line from being involved to being intrusive. But one thing on which we should all be able to agree is this: Government ought to be small enough that Ted Cruz, if he one day becomes president, can never, ever use it to determine how we, as a people, masturbate.Spring is almost in full swing and summer is just around the corner. Millions of children in America can\u0027t wait for summer vacation, but for millions of poor children who rely on school meals it\u0027s a mixed blessing.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe Brooklyn debate may not have changed any minds, but for either one of the candidates it was an excellent rehearsal for the general election debates that lie ahead. In its contentiousness the event felt more like a cross-party debate than a confrontation between ideological allies.Professor of Journalism, Northeastern University, BostonIt is quite clear whose privacy and very lives are really at risk if state legislatures continue to succumb to anti-trans fear and hatred and give it state sanction.Director of the ACLU Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender \u0026 AIDS ProjectIf Cruz wants to call the Muslim American community radical, he needs to look in the mirror. We are not the ones pushing our religious beliefs into the political process.Writer, Activist, MomWho is left? House Speaker Paul Ryan seems to mean it when he says he\u0027s not interested in the nomination. Jeb Bush has already been rejected by Republican voters in the primaries, notwithstanding his best known name and massive campaign funds. Kasich is the remaining, vetted default option.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorBreaking Barriers is a character education and literacy program that teaches students that we all face barriers in our lives, even Major League players. We help students understand the importance of character and how Jackie Robinson used his core values to overcome his barriers.Educational consultant for Major League BaseballWith the growing tensions on the campaign trail hitting a near boiling point between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders, everyone who follows politics closely saw this collision course on the horizon.Democratic strategist, campaign consultant and political analyst based in Los Angeles, California. Works at the firm Shallman CommunicationsMany Ukrainians expect America and Europe to save them. Suggest that they are living a fantasy gets you tarred as a blatant fool and Russian stooge. Yet Ukraine shouldn\u0027t waste time posing as a fairy tale maiden in distress waiting for rescue by the Western knight in shining armor. Kiev risks ending up as a failed state.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteLast night, I was asked to speak at a rally for Senator Bernie Sanders as a physician and healthcare activist who supports him for president. I did not clear my prepared words with anyone in the campaign, and a portion of my speech has since generated tremendous outrage. I want to apologize.Physician, Executive Chairman of the Courage Campaign, Healthcare Activist\"Your father had a dream where he saw you walking up a ladder to heaven. My hope is that I will see you here on earth again but if I do not, I know you are in heaven. Please serve God faithfully and I pray that God bring you back to me. I miss you, my daughter.\"Founder and Executive Director of Pathfinders Justice Initiative, Inc. (www.pathfindersji.org).But this time around the doctors made it clear that a cure is only possible by going through a bone marrow transplant, or as we affectionately call it, BMT. Just chemo wasn\u0027t going to cut it. That\u0027s when the real learning started.Co-founder of AdGearWe adults can bewail the use of child soldiers by all those thuggish brigades around the world. But as in The Lord of the Flies, those young people are just enacting the savageries of their elders. They are both victims and perpetrators.Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogBoth cases involve nineteen year-olds. One is white. One is black. One comes from wealth. One comes from one of the most impoverished communities in America.Award-Winning Author of Freestyle: Reflections on Faith, Family, Justice, and Pop Culture; Founding Pastor of Joy Tabernacle A.M.E. Church in Dallas, TexasThis was never an attack on Julián Castro personally, or an attack on his broader record as a progressive. It is about the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u0027s track record of playing footsie with Wall Street in terms of distressed housing. And however great Secretary Castro is on other issues, this track record sure isn\u0027t great.Co-Founder, Democracy PartnersDespite its positive mission, SSA has been engaging in a destructive practice that represents government not working for us, but against us. SSA has been sending, to hundreds of thousands of Social Security beneficiaries and SSI recipients, bills for what it concludes are overpayments.Founding Co-director, Social Security WorksTwo years on, and their parents still wake up each morning not knowing whether their daughters are alive or dead, married or single or violated as slaves. They surely deserve more than a forlorn hope.Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which was once at the front and center of the Arab world and a significant player on the global stage due to its oil riches, has been steadily losing its regional influence and prominent role.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUThe completely absurd state-affair surrounding the barely significant poetic and verbal derailments of a thin, pale boy is perhaps the most bizarre, frightening and - in my opinion -- dangerous discussion regarding free speech we\u0027ve encountered in a long time.Actor, comedian, satiristBecause the United States is the most powerful country in the world -- and given the state of the region -- some have second-guessed the decisions that President Obama and his Administration have made on the Middle East.U.S. Permanent Representative to the United NationsConnecticut lawmakers should adopt a budget for fiscal year 2017 that avoids short-term austerity and instead focuses on addressing Connecticut\u0027s long-term, structural challenges. Although the specifics of that budget will require significantly more discussion and compromise, we offer a few guiding principles to set the stage for that conversation.Fiscal Policy Fellow at Connecticut Voices for ChildrenLaw student at Yale UniversityRihanna was once the world\u0027s preeminent pop star. And yes, I use past tense. Despite having her hit \"Work\" firmly ensconced at number one for the past two months, a stat that ties her with the Beatles as second only to Mariah Carey for most weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100 chart, Rihanna has recently transcended pop stardom.Senior Editor, Huffington Post CanadaIf you are considering becoming an organ, eye and tissue donor after death, don\u0027t let those myths stop you from signing up. Here are some important truths you need to know:Chief Medical Officer, United Network for Organ SharingI am a successful physicist -- ambitious, passionate about my work, with an excellent academic pedigree at top institutions.
