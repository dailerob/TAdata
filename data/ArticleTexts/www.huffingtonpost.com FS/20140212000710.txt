{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Mark GongloffChief financial writer, The Huffington PostBelieve it or not, 99 percenters, the 1 percent feels your pain: It suffers from inequality, too. An extremely comfortable inequality. But still, inequality. The incomes of the very, very wealthiest Americans -- the top 0.01 percent -- have exploded since the 1980s, even more dramatically than the incomes of the next-wealthiest Americans -- the top 0.1 percent and 1 percent. Such stark division at the very top of the income scale is known as \"fractal inequality,\" according to The New York Times, which sounds like something out of physics. Speaking of physics, just as the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate, so is inequality.Comments (255)Mark DannerAuthor, \u0027Torture and the Forever War\u0027For all his experience and sophistication, that grimly blank expression -- calmly unflinching gaze, slightly lopsided frown -- embodied a philosophy of power unapologetically, brutally simple: attack, crush enemies; cause others to fear, submit. Power from time to time must be embodied in vivid violence, like Voltaire\u0027s executions, pour encourager les autres.Comments (49)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Since we have a Congress that is unwilling to take the steps to increase demand in the labor market, the best way we may have of increasing job openings is by reducing supply.CommentsRobert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, Beyond OutrageAs the gap between America\u0027s wealthy and the middle has widened, those at the top have felt even richer by comparison. Although a rising tide would lift all boats, many of America\u0027s richest prefer a lower tide and bigger yachts.Comments (82)Josh StearnsPress Freedom Campaign Director at Free PressAfter a year of attacks on whistleblowers and digital journalists and revelations about mass surveillance, the United States plunged 13 spots in the group\u0027s global press freedom rankings to number 46.CommentsToni IrvingExecutive Director, Get In ChicagoHere\u0027s the stark reality. We have spent incalculable dollars on well-intentioned projects to curb juvenile violence. But we can\u0027t say what works best. We simply don\u0027t know. It\u0027s not from failing to try.Comments (22)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkWhat Michael Sam did took tremendous strength and valor. Not only did he proclaim his truth to the world, but he did so knowing that he could very well lose a lot in the process.Comments (17)Arianna HuffingtonEvery day there really are more and more conversations happening about the benefits of mindfulness and sleep and stress reduction. And not just in outlets that write about these topics on a regular basis, but in every part of the media landscape.Comments (16)Larry WomackFounder, 1450 Media; former Associate News Editor, The Huffington PostWas the Christian God cool with slavery? Slave owners sure thought so -- and had plenty of Biblical canon to support it. Abolitionists disagreed. Did God want women to vote? Not according to anti-suffragists. Suffragists were convinced otherwise.Comments (508)Kristen Welchwearethatfamily.comI can confirm the temperature because I have known the extremes: a cold marriage, filled with contempt and misery. A lukewarm marriage, perhaps the worst, filled with idle days, stagnant affection and distant intimacy. We have lived every season.Comments (44)Jeff JarvisAuthor, \u0027Public Parts\u0027 and \u0027What Would Google Do?\u0027Here\u0027s why I hate the convention: The stand-up has zero journalistic value. It wastes time. It wastes precious reportorial resource. It turns the world into a mere backdrop for entertainment. It\u0027s a fake.Comments (57)Jordan PriceDesigner, artist, and father living in San FranciscoAll I know is that I wanted to work at Apple really bad -- and now not so much. Today at lunch time I wiped the iPad data clean, put the files I had been working on neatly on the server, left all their belongings on my desk, and I got in my car and drove home.CommentsJenny DavisAssistant Professor of Sociology, James Madison UniversityThe kind of individualist framing inherent in shaming endeavors, though it certainly highlights the existence of deeply racist people, simultaneously hides the ways that racism is a key structural component of American culture, infiltrating its institutions, organizations, and citizens. This is detrimental to the larger antiracist project.CommentsAdam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911Valentine\u0027s Day is a high-pressure holiday for many people, and we\u0027ve all been in situations where our foolish hearts trump our ability to see through a scam.CommentsJessica RassetteBlogger, Photographer, www.bubandteebs.comI have to believe that in the years to come my babies won\u0027t remember the times I said \"wait\" nearly as clear as the times I said nothing and sat to be with them. I have to believe that as long as I am scraping out every last part of me that I have to give to these children, like scraping out the guts of a pumpkin, and even if after all of the scraping it still doesn\u0027t feel like enough, I have to believe that if I\u0027m really trying then it is enough.CommentsRobert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Watching the film American Hustle, we can enjoy a sublime, over-the-top \u002770s show, as well as some civic satisfaction that some corrupt officials actually went to prison. Meanwhile, the ultimate American Hustlers are still on the street, laughing all the way to the bank.Comments (53)Jordan SchultzThe Huffington Post\u0027s sports columnist, The Schultz ReportAnthony has enjoyed some wonderful individual moments in New York City, but it\u0027s done little good for the organization as a whole.CommentsJohn FefferCo-director, Foreign Policy In FocusJust as the seemingly impregnable Honecker regime rapidly disintegrated along with the Berlin Wall in November 1989, the Kim dynasty in North Korea has been expected to collapse at any minute. This minute, of course, has lasted for more than two decades.CommentsStosh CotlerCEO, Bend the Arc: A Jewish Partnership for JusticeThere is something quintessentially American and quintessentially Jewish about voting -- and fighting for the right to vote. After all, voting is an act of faith. It\u0027s a ritual, part of belonging to the community.CommentsMike LuxCo-Founder, Democracy PartnersWhen you break laws -- hugely significant laws -- over and over again, and those crimes result in harm to millions of people, there should be some justice applied. The fact that the justice has been so inadequate to the crime is a deep and fundamental failure.CommentsEvelyn LauerChicago-based writer and teacher, working on a memoir about loveLove is not part of a checklist to life. But marriage is. This is a reality -- and if you deny this, then you\u0027re not watching \"Say Yes to the Dress\" or flipping through bridal magazines. I\u0027m not thrilled about this fact; it\u0027s one of the reasons I avoided marriage for so long.CommentsRaymmar TiradoWriterBecause while you\u0027re out spending your money on new outfits, new cars, overpriced meals or nights at the bar, I\u0027ll be investing in myself. And while you try to fit in with the world I\u0027ll make the world fit in with me.Comments (59)Jordan K. TurgeonSenior Lifestyle Blog Editor, The Huffington PostWould I be checking because I genuinely wanted to see all those pictures and status updates? Or would I be checking out of some strange obligation now that it was \"allowed\" again? I hadn\u0027t missed social media during my time away, so why go back?CommentsDavid HearstEditor, Middle East EyeSisi\u0027s rise from career officer to national savior is reminiscent of another man who has set back the cause of democracy in his country by decades: Vladimir Putin.CommentsMichael BrennerSenior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghInstitutions in the United States are not meant to be owned by those who lead them. They are not possessions to be disposed of according to the will and inclination of managers or governors.Comments (12)Matthew BershadkerASPCA President and CEOThese arrests and the enormous number of animal seized should open some eyes to the modern face of this abhorrent crime -- it\u0027s both more prevalent and more savage than most dare to think.CommentsJames PeronPresident, Moorfield Storey InstituteGay athletes aren\u0027t the ones who have to worry about being kidnapped and tortured by anti-gay gangs, with videos of the crimes put online to share with other bigots. Iraschko-Stolz speaks from a unique position of privilege, one denied to actual victims.Comments (18)Bruce AckermanProfessor of law and political science, Yale; Author \u0027The Decline and Fall of the American Republic\u0027The present system of checks and balances is broken. Now is a good time to consider serious reform. Neither Democrats nor Republicans can be confident that they will win in 2016, and reap the short-term rewards of the next round of unilateralism.Comments (31)Matt WalshBlogger, talk radio host, father of twinsIf there\u0027s one thing about life that I wish everyone would consider -- particularly my peers, and those younger than me -- it\u0027s that you\u0027ll never do the big things if you\u0027re waiting until you\u0027re ready to do them. You\u0027ll never be ready.Comments (21)Jonathan WeilerDirector of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel HillIn a world in which character often reduces to maintaining proper decorum as media and (often belligerent) fans define it, it\u0027d be nice for there to be a little more acknowledgement of the reality of race in America and the extent to which it informs the world of sports.CommentsMaxwell StrachanBusiness Editor, The Huffington PostIt\u0027s not that I\u0027m some sort of reckless spender who blows money on ridiculous things like cab rides or vegetables. I just have one indefensible and enormously bad habit and I have a hard time admitting it even to myself: I rack up ATM fees like a complete moron.Comments (127)Robert Rosenthal, 2014.11.02Mark Morford, 2014.11.02Dean Baker, 2014.11.02VisualNews.com, 2014.11.02Mary Buffett, 2014.11.02Brian DAmbrosio, 2014.11.02Lynette Mae, 2014.11.02Marcel Hidalgo, 2014.11.02Wayne Maines, 2014.11.02Shana Nys Dambrot, 2014.11.02Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"SOUTH BRACES FOR \u0027CATASTROPHIC\u0027 STORM",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
