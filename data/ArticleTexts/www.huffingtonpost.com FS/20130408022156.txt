{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonOn Tuesday, President Obama announced a federal effort to map the human brain in unprecedented detail. With any luck, it might help explain the kind of loopy thinking we saw demonstrated at the end of the week. On the one hand, we had the latest jobs report, which showed a country still in crisis, with the addition of only 88,000 new jobs, and the share of the population in the workforce falling to the lowest point in decades. Yet the leaked details of the president\u0027s new budget show a focus not on job creation but on cutting the deficit by $1.8 trillion over the next 10 years (in addition to cutting Social Security benefits). So amidst hard evidence of our profound and continuing economic crisis, we get a budget offering a solution to a different (and far less pressing) problem. It\u0027s enough to set what Obama called \"the three pounds of matter that sits between our ears\" spinning.Comments (245)Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOI was struck by what came out of the Troika this week after it finished negotiating the program with the authorities in Cyprus. This is not the first time officials bungle an element of the Cypriot rescue.Comments (40)Jim CarreyActorHow shallow do they think I am? I would trade my money, my fame, my reputation and legacy if there were the slightest chance of preventing the anguish of another Columbine, Virginia Tech, Aurora, or Sandy Hook Elementary School. I ask you, truly, what manner of human being would not?Comments (4,381)Chelsea ClintonSpecial correspondent, NBC NewsAcross gender lines, intelligence exists in equal supply. But in far too many places, opportunity does not. Lost potential especially abounds in the asymmetrical landscape of science, technology, engineering, and math.Comments (1,138)Arianna HuffingtonWhen we launched \"Opportunity: What Is Working\" last July, we envisioned the section as a place to spotlight the opportunities that do exist around job creation. Today, we add to HuffPost\u0027s family of sections dedicated to telling the stories of these opportunities a new section called \"What Is Working: Small Businesses.\"Comments (90)Dylan RatiganNew York Times Best-Selling author and formerly the host of MSNBC\u0027s The Dylan Ratigan ShowAn awakening is happening in America, and it is as simple as creating jobs that solve our actual needs and, in the process, restore the very fabric of our own bodies and our relationship with the very planet we inhabit.Comments (152)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundDespite the loud voice of the National Rifle Association (NRA), scholars, experts on school safety, and teachers overwhelmingly disagree with turning schools into armed camps rather than places of nonviolent positive learning.Comments (495)Paul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostRick Warren\u0027s experience and words won\u0027t take away any of the heart break, but it will take away the shadow of stigma that mental illness and suicide still can hold in our society.Comments (43)Gloria GaynorSingerThe \"Queen is dead,\" was the report rumored to be circulating around my record company. Three months of physical therapy fraught with uncertainty about my career and ability to become financially stable again, ended with me approaching despair.Comments (49)Leonard MaltinFilm critic and historianThe role of critics has been marginalized by the growth of the Internet and the empowerment of self-made bloggers who are eager to share their opinions. But few, if any, of these wannabes will ever surpass Roger Ebert.Comments (59)Valerie JarrettSenior Advisor and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsSupporting small businesses and entrepreneurs has been a priority for President Obama since Day One of his administration. Why? Because he knows small businesses are responsible for creating two out of every three new jobs in the United States.Comments (242)Leo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersRepublicans never knew what their districts had gotten from the federal government. Until it was gone. Until after they\u0027d paved it over with the sequester. Now they\u0027re stalled in an economically barren parking lot of their own creation.Comments (662)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activist\"Stories can conquer fear,\" Nigerian novelist Ben Okri once said. \"They can make the heart bigger.\" There\u0027s a world of truth to that statement. As someone who comes from a long line of storytellers, I\u0027ve always said that our lives are just long and rich stories, knit together over the years, that tell us not only about ourselves, but the human condition, as well.Comments (32)James FrancoActor and authorThis week I went to see The Place Beyond the Pines. I loved the whole film and was engaged every moment of the way. But what I want to talk about is the first section, the Gosling section; I want to make love to this section.Comments (100)Tory BurchCEO and designer, Tory BurchWe\u0027ve realized that many of the women who participated in our mentorship programs needed something beyond advice and direction. They needed tools to help them develop their business and scale it.Comments (27)Ban Ki-moonSecretary-General, United NationsOn April 5, the world will reach a vital moment in history\u0027s largest and most successful anti-poverty push -- the 1,000-day mark before the target date to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.CommentsDr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarAs more and more women in the workplace compete with each other for jobs, they\u0027re calling on gossip as a means to get ahead -- or keep others down.Comments (263)Tavis SmileyPBS talk show host, PRI radio hostWhen is the last time you saw a stage full of Latino thought-leaders, opinion-makers and influencers who were being asked by the mainstream media about their views on something other than immigration reform?Comments (32)Sen. Debbie StabenowU.S. Senator from MichiganOver the last few months the country has been engaged in an in-depth conversation about guns. We need an equally serious conversation about mental health care.Comments (137)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorDespite negative public sentiment and the rise of the Occupy movement, the avarice on Wall Street arrogantly continues on. The big banks are now even bigger and more powerful than they were in 2008 when they were bailed out by the U.S. taxpayers.Comments (259)Annette InsdorfDirector of undergraduate film studies, Columbia University, and author of PHILIP KAUFMANHe knew that his days were numbered, and he filled them with as much intelligent love of film as possible. For those of us who were lucky enough to know Roger, his life was a gift.CommentsJohn KerryU.S. Secretary of StateThrough the expansion of the War Crimes Rewards Program, the Department of State is offering up to $5 million for information that leads to the arrest, transfer, and conviction of the top three leaders of the LRA: Joseph Kony, Okot Odhiambo, and Dominic Ongwen.Comments (249)Amber DusickAuthor and Illustrator: Parenting, Illustrated with Crappy PicturesEveryone snaps at some point.Comments (773)Grover NorquistPresident, Americans for Tax ReformThe IRS has one job, and one job only -- to collect taxes. It measures its success or failure in its ability to collect as much in taxes as possible. To ask the IRS to estimate the tax liability of a taxpayer is akin to asking an alcoholic how much they can have without crossing the line -- the answer will always be \"more.\"Comments (630)Dr. James HansenClimatologistHumanity\u0027s Faustian climate bargain is well-known. Humans have been pumping both greenhouse gases (mainly CO2) and aerosols (fine particles) into the atmosphere for more than a century. Is the new data we present here good news or bad news, and how does it alter the \"Faustian bargain?\"Comments (628)Hollee Actman BeckerWriter and author of the blog suburbabble.comIt\u0027s time for us to take our collective blinders off and really pay attention. Because the minute we give our kids an iPhone or iPod or any other gadget that puts technology quite literally in the palms of their hands, we become responsible for whatever happens next.Comments (403)Orlando JonesActor, ComedianIt\u0027s been hard to keep this one under wraps but I\u0027m about to embark on an exciting new chapter in my career and wanted to share it with my HuffPost family first and foremost before our official announcement tomorrow.Comments (15)Deepak ChopraCo-author, \u0027Super Brain: Unleashing the Explosive Power of Your Mind to Maximize Health, Happiness, and Spiritual Well-Being\u0027; founder, The Chopra FoundationThere is something important here that India\u0027s leaders -- and all global leaders -- must consider: A nation\u0027s soul precedes its human development. Organic human development will not occur in India if the majority of everyday experiences are negative.Comments (87)Gavin ShulmanWriter, ProducerForget fullboob. That\u0027s so flagrant. So in your face. Even the description \"full frontal\" sounds so crude. Wholeboob is a concerted effort, with lights and Photoshop, posing and makeup, planning and care -- sideboob is a sneak attack.Comments (66)Kristin Kirkpatrick, M.S., R.D., L.D.Manager of Wellness Nutrition Services at Cleveland Clinic Wellness InstituteDue to its worldwide popularity, coffee is probably the greatest source of antioxidants in the global diet. And while having lots of it isn\u0027t recommended for everyone, for some of us, it may just be the superfood of the century. Here are nine reasons to start the day with this healing drink.Comments (167)Craig NewmarkFounder, craigslist and craigconnects.orgThere\u0027s a lot of confusion and misinformation regarding the disability claims backlog at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Setting the record straight requires some honest brokering with many years experience in both customer service and writing computer software.Comments (48)Lubomir Kavalek, 2013. 7.04Shawn Amos, 2013. 7.04Don McNay, 2013. 7.04Michael S.
