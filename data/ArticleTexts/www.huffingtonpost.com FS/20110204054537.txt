{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Christian leader for social changeBy all journalistic reports, it was the Egyptian government of President Hosni Mubarak that sent thousands of armed thugs into Tahrir Square and the streets of Cairo yesterday to bring violence to what had been a peaceful and nonviolent protest for democracy. Some think many of those who were attacking the protesters were police in plain clothes. Others are believed to have been hired and bused in to foment violence with machetes, clubs, and razors -- some riding in on horses and camels into the peaceful crowds. A call for peace now must mean a call for Mubarak\u0027s immediate resignation.Read Post | CommentsJoel Simon, 02.03.2011Executive Director, Committee to Protect JournalistsStanding up for the rights of journalists may be our last, best hope of stemming an impending bloodbath that could go down in history as the gravest example of political repression.Read Post | CommentsJoe Cirincione, 02.03.2011President of Ploughshares FundOne of Ronald Reagan\u0027s most powerful and living legacies was his dream of a world free of nuclear weapons.
