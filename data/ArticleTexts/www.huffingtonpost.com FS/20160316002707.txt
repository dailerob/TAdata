{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorAs I\u0027ve watched the decay of our civilization and the devolution of our culture displayed at these Trump for president campaign rallies, I have pondered the words of Booker T. Washington, \"Let no man pull you so low as to make you hate him.\" Donald J. Trump is pulling a whole lot of folks into his cesspit of hate, and he must be held accountable -- not tomorrow when it\u0027s too late, but today, before somebody gets killed. When he pulls you that low, you get drowned in depersonalization and disregard. Your humanity is hidden, and your message is muffled. He\u0027s now pulled us so low that violence has become the story line. Love wins, but hate makes the headlines. Why does America seem to have a love affair with hate?In one sense, Trump is uniquely disturbing, if only because his character disorder is so obvious. But megalomania did not make The Donald great -- our politics did.Novelist and contributing opinion writerIn February 2013, a year before Eddie Zee Holmes was killed, the NRA lobbied against a law that would have required Washington State residents to store their guns safely. If the bill had passed, Eddie might still be alive. But the NRA and gun company executives put profits ahead of safety.Filmmaker, Brave New FoundationI think it is crucial for those who share liberal, progressive values to unite behind the Democratic candidate in November. He or she may not be your first choice, but consider the alternative. I will not sit home. I will not vote for a third party candidate. I will vote for the nominee of the Democratic party.Research Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027It\u0027s the violence which redefined everything: our hopes, our beliefs, and our trust in the world. At a very early stage I had to rethink the answers to many violent questions: Am I a murderer? Am I capable of killing? Do I want to kill?Setting a unique news agenda that builds bridges and global understanding since 2005.This September, Mother Teresa will become Saint Teresa. This is unsurprising; she was beatified in 2003, which is sort of a one-way road to canonization. But it\u0027s the last thing we need. She was no saint.Associate Editor, What\u0027s WorkingThe fact is, recent trade deals are less about trade and more about global investment. Big American corporations no longer make many products in the United States for export abroad. Most of what they sell abroad they make abroad.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027Many in the United States struggle day in and day out with chronic pain.

Burwell, will be argued before the Supreme Court on March 23 -- exactly six years after President Obama signed the ACA into law.President, American Constitution Society for Law and PolicyBad things happen when mainstream public figures engage in incendiary rhetoric that vilifies or scapegoats minorities. The Boston attack is just one incident, and no one can say with certainty that Trump was the cause of it. But a disturbing pattern is developing.President, Southern Poverty Law CenterDear Germany, I think we both need some time apart, and a little distance. Maybe then you\u0027d realize how much you miss me and how boring life would be without me.Former Chairman of the IBC - International Business Club e.V. in GelsenkirchenRather than call out corruption and reassert the primacy of academic values, university presidents duck responsibility and cravenly feed the nation\u0027s basketball \"addiction\". Winning on the hard court, they have decided, is more important than integrity.Historian of Europe, critic of university governance, advocate of educational access for athletes and all students.If we can agree that we want more women to have their voices heard in business and policy, then we can recognize that those voices need to be heard at the conferences and networking events that fuel those arenas.Executive Editor, Business and TechnologyMcConnell is the \"Doctor No\" of American politics. And he has a thirty-year Senate track record of obstructionism to prove it.President, Democracy 21By supporting the June 28, 2009 coup d\u0027état in Honduras when she was secretary of state, Clinton helped create the dire conditions that caused many of these children to flee.Professor, Thomas Jefferson School of LawPutin\u0027s move has led to widespread speculation. Perhaps he has made a deal with the U.S., a grand bargain of sorts. Maybe Washington has offered a major concession on Ukraine, something President Barack Obama may gladly concede given what a disaster the U.S. adventure in that country has become.Foreign Affairs Correspondent, AuthorThree phrases propelled the Trump candidacy to the head of the pack: Red-mapping, front-loading and obstructing.Minister, Political strategist, Civil/Human Rights Activist, Northeast Regional Director, National Action NetworkBernie Sanders found a way to make tuition-free public college a reality with a common-sense approach. Like all of his plans, tuition-free public college is paid for without raising taxes on average Americans.DC native, Tufts grad, Harvard grad, social entrepreneur and Monitor alumHaving been so long stung by the ingredients of war -- oppression, intolerance, hatred, violence -- Syrians need healing, not just for their bodies. They need a signal that the world is not indifferent, that we see them, and we can name their pain and suffering.President and CEO of CARE, a global humanitarian organization that fights poverty by empowering girls and women.When it comes to health care, the United States has many of the same problems as the developing world. Despite the Affordable Care Act, 33 million Americans or 10.4 percent of the U.S. population still lacks health insurance. These people are disproportionately poor, black or Hispanic, and 4.5 million are children.Academic, Researcher, Writer, EntrepreneurCinema is no doubt an elitist form of art -- and then you get this black woman, daughter of a housemaid, saying she wants to become a director. It was definitely difficult.FilmmakerOn the other side of this world, there is hope. Somewhere that hope still exists amid your old lost dreams. You had once hoped to finish your studies but you were arrested after publishing an opinion article that spoke out against the regime.Arab Reform Initiative’s Arabic Communication Officer, Media Analysis Consultant and Freelance JournalistWhat we have today is not civilian supremacy over, nor even civilian control of the military, but what could be characterized as civilian subjugation to the military, where civilian officials are largely militarily illiterate, more militaristic than the military itself, and running scared politically (lest they be labeled weak on defense and security).Professor, National Defense University; West Point Graduate; Vietnam War VetGeorgia\u0027s Governor Nathan Deal has to determine whether HB 859, the \"Campus Carry\" law passed by the Georgia legislature, should be signed. While I\u0027m sure the authors of the bill had good intentions, it violates nearly every Republican principle on the books.Political science professor, LaGrange College in GeorgiaYes, the old white guy is the radical, and I\u0027m thrilled that his ideas are getting national attention, support and legitimacy. But there\u0027s no denying that had Bernie been Bernadette you\u0027d have to get tied to a stake to feel the Bern.Writer, Performer, FeministLee Sedol has transformed this match between the human brain and artificial intelligence into a great and valuable learning opportunity. As we face the emerging era of artificial intelligence, he provided genuine insight into what humans must do and what steps we must take in the future.Professor of Medicine, Ajou UniversityIf you are Puerto Rican, you are probably paying close attention to the Democratic primaries. If you haven\u0027t, now it\u0027s very important that you do. Why? Because one of the candidates just released the most comprehensive and detailed plan on Puerto Rico so far in the race for the White House.Consultant, WriterIn order to rejuvenate government, the American people must become more active participants in elections. There is no better way to improve participation than to abolish the Electoral College, an unnecessary relic of a bygone era.Former Congressman and Secretary of Agriculture and a Senior Fellow at the Bipartisan Policy InstituteShe will act tough, she will pretend she doesn\u0027t have emotions. She does. They\u0027re tucked away deep down inside her broken heart. Let her know she is meant to be loved and you want to love her.Author, \u0027Life Goes On..?\u0027Bernie Sanders can beat Donald Trump, possibly taking the House and Senate with him.
