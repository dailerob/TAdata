{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorIf today\u0027s numbers push the Fed to raise slightly, so be it; a quarter of a percent shouldn\u0027t make much of a difference to the macroeconomy, and we could finally be done with the \"will-they-won\u0027t-they?\" game. But the important discussion now turns to the pace of their campaign. Once again, the critical factor here is to remember that a few months of decent average wage growth at freakishly low inflation does not make up for decades of inequality, wage stagnation, and the persistent, growing split between productivity growth and median compensation. So go ahead and tap the breaks, if you must, Yellen and co., but this recovery, much like the last one, has yet to lift the poor and middle class. Please give it a chance to do so.There was a sense of quiet determination amongst the participants, a feeling that addressing the climate crisis required something more than just emails and petition signatures: it was going to take putting our bodies on the line.Co-founder and Communications Director, 350.orgWe have entered the winnowing phase of the Republican presidential primary process, as those two bastions of the liberal media -- Fox Business Network and the Wall Street Journal -- announce they\u0027re downsizing who will be allowed into the next televised debate.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comI cannot adequately describe the pain. I can only pray that you are spared it and that the rest of us will one day find you in our corner, delaying no longer, but rather changing with sensitivity, intelligence and courage that which can be changed.Professor Emerita, USC Marshall School; Author, \u0027The Secret Handshake\u0027 and \u0027Shadow Campus\u0027Just when the prospects for single-payer or full Medicare for everyone appear to be going nowhere, from Pennsylvania\u0027s Lehigh Valley comes a stirring that could go national and make single-payer a reality.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorUnions are essential building blocks to a democratic economy with a strong middle class. It isn\u0027t an accident that as union membership has declined, inequality has risen to new extremes.President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureI\u0027m alive and I\u0027m a person. I don\u0027t like when a**holes tell me to smile. I don\u0027t like being told to be quiet, and I don\u0027t like having to turn the other cheek because strangers on the Internet could light me up all day long because they don\u0027t like big mean feminists. You don\u0027t get to make me afraid.Founder, Still Kickin; Author, \u0027It’s Okay To Laugh (Crying’s Cool Too)\u0027How ironic that Ryan talks about \"trust,\" because only two years ago the same leader said, \"We do not want to have a society where we have different classes of people who cannot reach their American dream by not being a full citizen.\"Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersI had found the Yin to my Yang and my ultimate BFF. We both went into our own directions but kept in contact and then I received the call. Eddie called me to inform me he was not gay. I remember thinking that this was a lost Queen and there was no way that he was straight.Fashion MarketingSpotlight is framed to highlight the Globe staff\u0027s own shocking epiphany, as reporters overcame a deferential mindset when they began to penetrate the defenses thrown up by the entrenched Catholic hierarchy.Author, Pulitzer’s Gold: Behind the Prize for Public Service JournalismThe star KIC 8462852 may have an unpronounceable name, but just about everyone with an interest in aliens has been talking about it. As of today, they can elaborate their discourse with some new results.Senior Astronomer, SETI InstituteChina\u0027s future development is about economic transformation. Through green growth and the application of Internet technologies, China can spur new opportunities and foster global sustainable development.Editor-in-chief, THEWORLDPOSTChildren desperately need adults to help them process and cope within the violent and uncertain world we have created for them. They also need to see adults working with and for them to create a better, safer nation and world for tomorrowPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundDear Christians, do know that just because you think you\u0027re right doesn\u0027t mean that everyone else is wrong. Though I no longer consider myself a Christian, I\u0027m still keeping a space for God in my heart. I didn\u0027t lose my religion. Instead, I\u0027m creating my own.Writer, Merman \u0026 Your GBF (@KeayNigel)I was an awkward nerd with more of an interest in skate-punk than hip-hop. Not fitting in with the other black kids was tough, but being queer put even more stress on my relationship to my blackness.Voices Editorial FellowSo the sports moguls are getting paid for patriotic events at ballparks like the singing of \"God Bless America,\" surprise homecomings and \"Hometown Heroes\" ceremonies? This tells us more about American fakery than we want to know.Senior Fellow, DemosThe Chinese restaurant across the street from me -- one of the last reasonably priced joints in the neighborhood -- closed last weekend. Their lease was up for renewal and the rent increased from $5,000 a month to $25,000.Senior writer, BillMoyers.com. Former senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.The ability of large corporations and hugely wealthy people to control the mechanisms of American government has been established by the narrowest of margins. One vote can determine if they can have it all. Now you know why Charles Koch is shopping for a president.President, Alliance for Justice and Alliance for Justice Action CampaignFor most of American history, \"religion\" equaled Christianity. Christians understood that the only true \"religion\" was theirs, and other forms of faith, belief, spirituality, and so on, were pagan, heathen, mistaken, corrupted, and so on.Chair of the Department of Religion, Emory University and Editor of Sacred Matters MagazineI swear to God, I\u0027ve aged eons since this election cycle began; the image above would be funny if it weren\u0027t so true. Why does it take Americans so damn long to elect a president? Why? It only took eight months for me to decide to marry my husband; just half a year is needed to grow enough wheat to feed the nation.Sass \u0026 SensibilityBy closing the \"performance pay\" loophole, Senator Warren\u0027s proposal would end a giveaway to the wealthiest in order to provide an extremely well-justified payment to tens of millions who have seen the value of their benefits slowly deteriorate for years.Founding Co-director, Social Security WorksAll this exposure to police misconduct has caused me to be more compliant, hoping to avoid all police officers. I fear that I might encounter that out of control officer who is triggered just by the fact that I am a black woman with a sense of my own dignity.Author, Speaker, ActivistDiabetes is a life-threatening disease. So how about we ditch the blame and the shame, the snarky memes and jokes, and empathize and educate instead?Screenwriter living in Los AngelesI believe there are many misconceptions about what mental health treatment looks like and stigma continues to be a burden by weighing down the choices that people are willing to make in regards to seeking help.LMSW, Founder of Respect Your StruggleData Overlords believe that if we know everything, we can control everything. Data Overlords are in some ways the scariest of the reformster tribes because they are mostly True Believers who don\u0027t ask two critical questions -- is it really possible to do all this? And is it a good thing to do?Teacher and writer; blogger, curmudgucation.blogspot.comThe next time a law like Houston\u0027s comes up -- and it will come up -- we owe transgender people better than tacit agreement. We owe the truth. It may not fix the problem, it may not ensure protection, but it\u0027s a lot better than staying silent.Writer, attorney, designer, and trans gay manI guess you\u0027d call it lube-shaming. But whatever you call it, it\u0027s awful.Columnist and author of \u0027Open: Love, Sex, and Life in an Open Marriage\u0027 and \u0027O Wow! Discovering Your Ultimate Orgasm\u0027I get it. I used to be you. Sometimes I still am. Conflating kindness with being a doormat, being carried by the current of the will of others. But today I want to tell you that what you\u0027ve been told is \"nice\" is really just eating shit with a smile. Let\u0027s talk about what many really mean when they talk about the \"nice girl.\"Writer based in PhiladelphiaGrannan is witness to the people who find themselves on the other side of the American dream in California\u0027s now-arid Central Valley, every bit as parched as the cracked and desiccated soil they live on.Culture Columnist, Huffington Post, CultureZohnNot only does this put into the minds of Americans that transition is something external that is forced, but it also paints us as villains in a time where over 20 trans women have been killed this year.Actress, Writer, Singer from L.A. Starring as Avery Ellis in the upcoming indie film Swallowing Doves.I find myself looking forward to children\u0027s television shows more than adult television shows, especially cartoons. I acknowledge that I can have the attention span of a squirrel, but there is something more to children\u0027s television shows than sunshine and rainbows lately -- there is humanity.Writer and social activist.Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
