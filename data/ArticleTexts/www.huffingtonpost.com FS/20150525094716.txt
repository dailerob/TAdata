{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027In the past, the story goes, as technology displaced some forms of work, the innovation eventually created new, mostly better jobs: fewer buggy-whip makers, more automobile assemblers; fewer telephone operators, more people designing iPhones and working in Apple genius bars. Technology made society richer on average, and employment took care of itself. But no longer, according to a spate of commentators. Why? Because the pace of displacement has accelerated, and it is reaching well into sectors once thought safe. And automation will only breed more automation. This story is mostly malarkey. Not the automation part; technological displacement of human work is indeed accelerating. The part that is malarkey is the assumption that high rates of human unemployment must necessarily result. They will indeed result if we trust “the invisible hand” to do the transition.We must recognize that striking the \"right\" balance between personal liberty and national security requires constant attention and reassessment. This is especially true following periods of crisis, when there is understandable pressure to tip the scales in favor of national security.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoThe press to fast-track TPP is a sellout of democracy, but it is also a symptom of a deeper collapse of faith in American self-government. Increasingly, people who want to get something done find ways around democratic lawmaking: private investment, nonprofit social mobilization, executive actions, lawsuits in the courts, anything but going to Congress.Professor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027For years, I bought into the idea that a relationship needed some type of drama to be legitimized. As I\u0027m settling down, I\u0027m realizing how truly wrong and exhausting that mentality was.Journalist, blogger, sober, Mpls.St.Paul Magazine internDemocrats continue to blame President Bush for beginning the war, in the first place, while Republican candidates are attempting to turn the tables by blaming President Obama for abandoning Iraq. In reality, Republicans and Democrats both share responsibility for Iraq\u0027s dismal state of affairs.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027We always want to avoid the hurt, anger and sense of loss. But I\u0027m really glad I married my ex because I wouldn\u0027t be the person I am today if I hadn\u0027t.Our mission is to help people love their best.Thanks to a 20-year push to avoid making the NAFTA mistake twice, there is now a progressive coalition capable of tossing fast track and corporate-giveaway trade deals into the fiery depths of a congressional volcano. The House of Representatives could very well be the Trans-Pacific Partnership\u0027s Mount Doom.Washington Director, MoveOn.org; host, The Good FightTerminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) has not been demonstrated to work effectively. It pushes China and North Korea to spend more money on more missiles to overwhelm THAAD (just as the U.S. is moved to spend more money on missile upgrades to counteract the missile defense of other countries). And it is a poor substitute for arms-control negotiations.Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogI had lunch recently with a new friend. In the midst of our \u0027getting to know you\u0027 questions, I asked if she had kids. She responded \u0027no.\u0027 The moment was uncomfortable. I felt awkward for asking. We moved on to another topic. This discomfort stayed with me.Author. Blogger. Mentor. Mom. Sharing stories of women reinventing themselves in midlife. Resources and inspiration complimentary.The U.S. has the most powerful military in the history of the world, but it should not be utilized as a political tool or for retribution. The government and its leaders must do their best to make the right decisions, to be truthful with the American people, and to provide all the necessary support needed to fulfill the military\u0027s mission. Unfortunately, this has not always been the case.Hofstra Journalism ProfessorWe have to face the fact that our massive privatization of what once were government functions has been a failure. There are some public services that get really loused up when done privately and for profit.Professor Emeritus, Duke UniversityThe landslide victory for marriage equality in Ireland caught some conservatives off guard. What happened to the staunchly conservative, almost fanatical Catholicism of the Irish people? Paul Valleley, a professor of public ethics at the University of Chester, offered some important suggestions. He lists two major reasons.President, Moorfield Storey InstituteAnne couldn\u0027t have been sweeter or more generous. The last thing she (or Jerry, for that matter) wanted was to have a couple of fans pester them while they attended what was bound to be a memorable comedy show. But they were nothing short of gracious. My wife remembers it as her \"favorite\" birthday. Rest in peace, Anne.Playwright and author (\"It\u0027s Never Been Easy: Essays on Modern Labor\")Memorial Day is, by federal law, a day of prayer for permanent peace. But is it possible to honestly pray for peace while our country is far and away number one in the world in waging war, military presence, military spending and the sale of weapons around the world?Law Professor, Loyola University New Orleans, CCR Associate Legal DirectorAll movements have unsung heroes whose work set the stage for the next generation to come along and make real change. Judge Lee\u0027s impact on the world of bankruptcy was monumental and touched every person in the U.S., but he was one of those people who set the stage for an Elizabeth Warren to come along and make some of the beliefs he felt so strongly become reality.Financial Expert focused on protecting people\u0027s nest eggs.Pretty pastels, sky-high cakes, bold brows and gold foil paper are all trending for spring. Here\u0027s how to make them yours.The go-to guide for all things weddingsIt is estimated that 80 to 85 percent of the energy consumed in the U.S. is from fossil fuels. One of the main reasons given for continuing to use this energy source is that it is much less expensive than alternatives. The true cost, however, depends on what you include in the calculation, and there are so many costs not figured in the bills we pay for energy.Assistant Professor of Clinical Marketing, Marshall School of Business, University of Southern CaliforniaBeing the somnonaut that I am, I have always been interested in trying to sleep in a R.E.S.T tank. While I was never convinced that I would emerge from the experience transformed into a short, hairy primitive being as in the 1980 William Hurt movie Altered States, I have always believed that the experience could be transformative.Medical Director, Charlottesville Neurology \u0026 Sleep Medicine, sleep medicine, neurology specialistDuring a summer weekend, many of us look forward to family activities, going to a beach, eating good food, or maybe just catching up on Mad Men. (Don\u0027t spoil the finale for me!) But while you are enjoying your leisure time, you can also be networking. Here are three tips to incorporate networking into your summer weekends!Ellevate is a global professional women\u0027s network dedicated to the economic engagement of women worldwide.Planning to teach Wharton soon, I took another look at Franzen\u0027s New Yorker hatchet job on Edith Wharton, and it was worse than I remembered. The critics\u0027 darling praises her classics The House of Mirth, The Custom of the Country, and The Age of Innocence but grossly misreads her character and her life.Author, reviewer, and bloggerThroughout our lives no one teaches us how to be in relationships. There are no classes in school that tell us how to have healthy and happy relationships. We are often just navigating them on our own and learning as we go. Given that we are often uneducated on healthy relationships, what are some things one can do to cultivate better relationships with others? Here are a few tips.Licensed psychotherapist, writer and public speaker.Kagame previously commanded the rebel forces that ended the 1994 Genocide and became President in 2000. Under his leadership, Rwanda has transformed from a broken nation into one of the safest, most productive and stable economies in Africa.Contributing Editor The WorldPost, Executive Producer ONE ON ONE SERIESNearly everyone honors our war dead. More ignored are the military dead who died following the wars. Far too often, family and loved ones were abandoned to cope with wounded who would never really recover. Perhaps it is time to discuss when politicians ignore veterans when no one is watching.Veteran and political activistThere seems to be a very beautiful trend taking shape that I am completely devoted to: It is starting to be popular to \"be loving.\"Her vision is to empower women, to be a leader in conscious fashion, and to encourage women to celebrate themselves and their bodies.Ethnicity is a tool rather than the cause for the reappearance of discord in Burundi. As means to rationalize his grab for perpetual office, President Pierre Nkurunziza has reached into the bag of tricks of stoking fear of \"the other.\" That is a zombie from the past that can rise from the dead.Former Bosnian foreign minister and ambassador to the United NationsThere is such a lot of conflicting advice out there on how to write your online dating profile. And let\u0027s be honest, it is important to get it right. I\u0027ve found it helpful to think about your profile rather like a cross between a CV and a great piece of PR. Does that sound tough?Author of Best Knickers Always: 50 Lessons for Midlife, life coach and speakerHad there been a draft when my sons were coming of age, I would have become an anti-war activist. No way would I have let my Cal and Corey go to Iraq or Afghanistan without putting up a fight. But there was not a draft, and my children did not enlist. And so I became one of the silent ones.Harvard Fellow, Advanced Leadership Initiative; Chairman and co-founder, LevengerMost of us were taught as children not to say certain words. But some of those words are really powerful and we need to take back that power.Architect, attorney, badass mother writer and the author of an irreverent novel, Thin Rich Bitches.Since the media have been regularly reporting on indictments and investigations of corporate crime and those responsible for billions of dollars through illegal activity, it becomes apparent that these rich and powerful figures, who now have \"the best government money can buy,\" enjoy a \"law of the rulers\" instead of the \"rule of law\" for which many Americans have fought and died.Education writerLesson learned this week: Don\u0027t sit near a restaurant\u0027s wood-burning pizza oven if you are a woman of a certain age unless you have frostbite.A community for women over 40. Discussing aging, sexuality, changing relationships and more. We\u0027ll tell it to you straight. And make you laugh.Like a clear majority of Israelis, I have long believed that the Palestinians have \"a right to be a free people on their land.\" It would serve not only Palestinian interests but Israeli interests as well.
