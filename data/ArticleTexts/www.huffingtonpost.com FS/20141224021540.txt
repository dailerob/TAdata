{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Last week, I wrote a piece in this space lamenting the fact that so many Democrats had voted for a budget package that gutted a key provision of the Dodd-Frank Act. The so called swaps push-out provision, now repealed, required banks to separate their speculative business in derivatives from depository banking covered by government insurance and further protected by the Federal Reserve. The broader budget deal, technically a continuing resolution to keep the government funded through next September, also cut a lot of needed public spending and added several odious riders, including one that raises the ceiling on individual campaign contributions to party committees about tenfold. Had Democrats resolutely opposed the deal, I argued, it would have revealed Republicans as friends of Wall Street and enemies of Main Street -- a useful party differentiation between now and 2016.Americans are skilled at that combination of complacency and despair that assumes things cannot change and that we, the people, do not have the power to change them. Yet you have to be abysmally ignorant of history, as well as of current events, not to see that our country and our world have always been changing, are in the midst of great and terrible changes, and are occasionally changed through the power of the popular will and idealistic movements.Author, \u0027Men Explain Things to Me\u0027I pray for unity in the city, as pain runs deep in many communities. But, we will no longer tolerate those, like Pat Lynch, who want to create more pain by attempting to divide the people and those who have taken an oath to protect and serve them.Founder, GlobalGrind.comFor me, Christmas is a reading, restful time and I like particularly to read a book that sweeps me into a complete world, somewhere else. It may be a true somewhere else, but it should be far from our own every day. That is precisely what The Queen of Four Kingdoms will do.Writer and creator, \u0027Downton Abbey\u0027The Heathrow plot is among the clearest. Heathrow is certainly a prestigious target -- the IRA fired mortars onto runways during a series of attacks in 1994 -- but the CIA didn\u0027t prevent an attack on the airport by torturing information out of prisoners.Director, Human Rights First\u0027s Human Rights Defenders ProgramI found myself driving by his condo one evening in early December. Through the long rectangular windows, I saw the white lights of a Christmas tree sparkling against the glass. And I knew, in my heart, he had found someone else.Chicago-based writer and teacher, working on a memoir.If the physician determines that the patient is, in fact, a health risk if there\u0027s a gun around, how do you determine the degree of gun access without infringing on his right to own a gun whether he\u0027s a risk for gun violence or not?Mike the Gun GuyI stand on both sides of the so-called \"blue line,\" placing one foot in the world of the NYPD furious over the murder of two of our own and another foot in with the black and brown people of this city angry with the senseless deaths of young people at the hands of the police.Retired New York City Police Captain turned preacher, teacher and theologian\"All men are created equal, endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights...\" We may not live this creed every day; surely we have fallen short. But to deliberately betray it, especially for gains which are \"unknowable,\" is a betrayal of our very identity as a nation.Independent United States Senator from MaineHope is not a feeling. It is a decision -- a choice you make based on what we call faith or moral conscience, whatever most deeply motivates you.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersCDC is America\u0027s health protection agency. Along with our many governmental and private sector partners, we\u0027re working 24/7to find, stop, and prevent disease - in every state, throughout our nation, and in many countries around the globe.Director, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)2014 was a year of great personal sadness for me. Herewith a short list of things that pierced the veil.Culture Columnist, Huffington Post, CultureZohnWe won\u0027t be able to stop disasters from happening. On the contrary, climate change may increase the frequency and severity of floods, droughts and storms. But we are better equipped today to prepare for them and reduce their impact.Chief Operating Officer and Managing Director, World BankAs we steel ourselves to keep combatting this crisis, it\u0027s important to highlight the public health lessons learned over 2014. Such crucial lessons will be critical for nations, health systems, and donors to embrace as Ebola evolves and other challenges emerge in 2015.Dean and DeLamar Professor of Public Health, Columbia University Mailman School of Public HealthLooking forward to 2015, I am hopeful that we will, as a nation, support lifestyle choices and leaders that will support a healthier, safer place to live. We can all aspire to achieve a world without cancer and other life-threatening diseases.Board-certified radiologist; Board member, Lesscancer; Author, \u0027A World Without Cancer\u0027Normalization with Cuba will be a process, and its pace and scope will depend in part on the actions of the Cuban government to permit dissent. A good start would be to join international conventions that protect human rights.Chairman, Senate Judiciary CommitteeMillions of Americans are still filing for bankruptcy because of medical debt, even though they have insurance. In 2015, families could be on the hook for 13,200 in out-of-pocket expenses before their coverage kicks in. That\u0027s far more than many household budgets will allow.Author, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgFor a decade we have had credible reports, testimony and accounts of how the torture program was decided, organized and executed. We have known that the Agency at the highest level took the radical step of destroying video evidence of torture out of fear of criminal prosecution and damage to its bureaucratic empire lavishly funded beyond their wildest dreams thanks to the \"war on terror\" boon.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghAfter declaring this Santa the real article, my 6-year-old nephew Tyler bellowed, \"We\u0027re all very lucky kids!\" But I felt like the lucky one. Because in that moment, I felt the magic of Christmas that had escaped me since mom had died. I couldn\u0027t think of a single reason why I shouldn\u0027t be smiling.Writer, father, video host, one-time fantasy football championIt has been an especially good time over the past month watching President Obama give the congressional Republicans exactly what they asked for when they decided to oppose everything he did. But it\u0027s time to complete the trifecta: raise overtime pay for American workers.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027Two weeks before Charles Schumer once again delivered for Wall Street with the omnibus budget deal, he gave a major speech in which he sounded like a progressive champion. He embodies the contradictions that will tear the Democratic Party apart over the next two years.Senior Fellow, Roosevelt Institute; author of \u0027Fighting for Our Health\u0027In this interview, he explores the work of Thomas Piketty and the need for the field of economics -- and the country -- to come to terms with the growing gulf between haves and have-nots.Author and cultural theoristGet up off that fainting couch. You\u0027re about to become the Banksy of winter footwear.WriterEducation can be your cause when you believe in empowerment through learning. Education can be your cause when you believe that inquiry and communication can lead to positive change in the world. Let\u0027s make education, a broad and pragmatic liberal education, our cause in 2015.President, Wesleyan UniversityWhat we need in the United States is not division; what we need is not hatred; what we need is not violence and lawlessness, but is love, and wisdom, and compassion toward one another, and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityFrom the report on torture we can draw three lessons. The first is a terrible one, but the other two are encouraging. The first thing the report teaches us is that it is possible for the most prominent intelligence agency of the world\u0027s most powerful democracy to commit torture on a large scale.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.Consider this: The federal government could, without any new laws, significantly restrict both the supply of, and demand for, fossil fuels. Only the state has the power to euthanize the fossil fuel industry. If the climate movement is serious about controlling Big Carbon it needs to get serious about Big Government.Contributing editor, The NationEach year, millions of books make their way through The New York Public Library system. With so many books to choose from, it would seem an impossible task for our librarians to select their favorites. But, shockingly, it wasn\u0027t nearly as difficult as we thought!Creating the library for the futureBut deep down inside, behind that smile plastered on your face and your wishes of \"peace on earth\" and \"happy holidays\" there\u0027s something else you\u0027re feeling. It\u0027s panic. For a business owner, the holidays churn up fears and bring out the worst of your financial anxieties.Small business management columnist, author, speaker, and business ownerSince many traditional Democratic constituencies strongly oppose these deals it is reasonable to ask why the Obama administration is so intent on pushing them. The answer is simple: money.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Now that I\u0027m a dad, nobody ever asks me what I want. But if they did? I\u0027d reply exactly the same way as my mom and dad. Because I was wrong; they weren\u0027t joking.
