{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"In the year since Thrive was published, I\u0027ve been thrilled to meet people all over the world who are longing for change. People are rejecting the myth that burnout has to be the price we must pay for success. But again and again, I was asked, \"It\u0027s hard to change old habits -- how do I go from understanding what I need to do in order to thrive to actually doing it?\" That\u0027s why I\u0027m so excited that I\u0027ve partnered with the great team at Oprah.com to launch a six-week course on Thrive -- a bridge from knowing what we need to do in order to thrive to actually doing it and thriving!The essential precursor to any solution -- a will to recognize the equal rights of non-Jews in any of the five states that Israel controls -- is absent. Whether that refusal is best represented by a Bibi who says no concessions or a Buji whose idea of an ideal world is that Israel keeps all of the land it has occupied, I leave that for others to judge.Editor, Middle East EyeHe may believe that he is serving the best interests of the Jewish people, as he understands them. But more than anything, he has been a servant of fear, a tribune of reaction and, ultimately, an obstacle to any enduring or just peace.Director of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel HillFew people in America face more discrimination and are more misunderstood than transgender people. Often, it is the misunderstanding that leads to the discrimination. The CBS Evening News with Scott Pelley will try to shed some much-needed light on their world.Medical Correspondent, CBS Evening News with Scott PelleyPart of the reason why opponents to a nuclear deal with Iran are so bewildered by President Barack Obama\u0027s diplomacy is because their belief that Iran can be forced to capitulate. Nothing could be further from the truth.Research Director, National Iranian American CouncilPresident, National Iranian American CouncilShould the next government end up being led by Netanyahu, every Israeli will live to mourn the demise of Israel as a democratic and Jewish state and the home of brave pioneers who made a millennium-long dream a reality.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUFor now, Ferguson has become the symbol and brand of the challenges we face in a multi-racial society. Perhaps this once sleepy little town has been waiting for this moment all along. Perhaps the country needs to reach deep into the heartland to get its heart right again.JournalistIt\u0027s an open secret that the Pentagon has routinely been using the war budget -- known as the Overseas Contingency Operations account -- as a slush fund to pay for items that don\u0027t fit within the caps on its base budget. If a new report is accurate, the House Budget Committee will propose an increase of over $40 billion in the OCO account, bringing the total to an astounding $90 billion.Director, Arms and Security Project, Center for International PolicyInstead of using Loretta Lynch\u0027s nomination as a bargaining chip, Republicans should stop playing politics and confirm her as the first African-American woman to serve as Attorney General of the United States. There is no valid reason whatsoever to wait another day to bring up her nomination.Senior Member of the Senate Foreign Relations CommitteePearson\u0027s hyperactive attitude towards test security is disturbing not only because of how it is being enacted without concern of proportion, privacy, and the implications of initiating state level investigations into unremarkable student speech.Director of Secondary Education and Secondary Special Education Teacher Preparation, Seton Hall UniversityThere are countless charities to choose from, and many do good work. But a precious few can say they dramatically improve or save people\u0027s lives in a cost-effective way, and then back up their claims with hard data.Senior Editor, The Huffington PostMy name is Seamus, but I don\u0027t celebrate St. Patrick\u0027s Day. I\u0027m worried the holiday has become a farce, a celebration of cartoonish symbols of Irish culture that minimize, dilute and demean what it means to be Irish.Senior Producer, The Players\u0027 TribuneThe BDSP is based on a bedrock belief in how America should work: that the only strength that really matters is military and that a great country is one with the capacity to beat the bejesus out of everyone else.Author of \u0027War Is Not a Game: The New Antiwar Soldiers and the Movement They Built\u0027The economy toward which we\u0027re hurtling -- in which more and more is generated by fewer and fewer people who reap almost all the rewards, leaving the rest of us without enough purchasing power -- can\u0027t function.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027While all water conservation is good, not all water conservation is equal. If you make a few smarter choices, you really shouldn\u0027t feel guilty about the things listed below -- provided you don\u0027t over-indulge.JournalistThis is not just a question of the best slogan for a marketing campaign; it\u0027s a question of how we think about workers\u0027 rights. Walker and his supporters want people to believe that a basic right of workers is being denied if they are forced to pay a union representation fee. This is nonsense if we think about the issue in its full context.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Eating wild seafood can contribute to solving one of our most pressing problems, the fact that one billion people wake up hungry every day. Even so, what does fine dining have to do with solving world hunger?Actor; board member, OceanaCEO, OceanaDo you want to make your ex squirm?

Loves Kittens, photography, and writing my blog, Losergurl.comHis latest and most personal project to date, entitled 2014 Forest Hills Drive, is a reflection on how a boy from North Carolina discovered his life\u0027s purpose. In this clip, J. Cole opens up about one particularly significant track on the album, \"Love Yourz.\"PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorWhat is Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u0027s plan? He offers increased funding, but only if his reforms on teacher evaluation and so-called merit pay are also adopted. But the reality is that using students\u0027 results on standardized tests to measure the effectiveness of teachers -- also known as Value Added Assessment (VAM) -- is simply not supported by research on the matter.Author of \u0027Obama’s America: A Transformative Vision of Our National Identity\u0027Most of us are never educated about feelings. Instead, we\u0027re expected to learn socially acceptable ways to deal with feelings by watching the people around us. But the truth is, many people don\u0027t role model healthy ways to deal with feelings. Here are some of the most common misconceptions about emotions...Psychotherapist and author of 13 Things Mentally Strong People Don\u0027t DoVery few people find early in life what they want to do and get to do it all their lives.

For these reasons, I will not lecture at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in the spring of 2015.Senior Advisor to the Provost at Brandeis University, Professor of LawPearson promotes Common Core and Common Core creates markets for Pearson. Teaching history the Pearson way means teaching it the Common Core way, without any meaningful content. The text, no matter how inaccurate or misleading, rules. Myth replaces history.Social studies educator, Hofstra University, my opinions, of course, are my ownThe Corinthian story is certainly an unjust one. These strikers have raised issues which go to the heart of our nation\u0027s entire student debt crisis. That crisis affects 41 million Americans, who hold an estimated $1.3 trillion in debt. Those are staggering numbers -- and if we do nothing they will continue to soar.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourSenior Fellow, Advanced Leadership Initiative, Harvard University. Co-Founder and President Emeritus, Presidio Graduate SchoolSenior Fellow, Advanced Leadership Initiative, Harvard University. Co-founder, National Student Debt Jubilee ProjectWe could be falling into the abyss of a new dark age where nationalism, populism, and xenophobia rules the world order in a sinister combination of fanaticism, ignorance, and anti-science. Unlikely? No. Look to history.Author, \u0027The Global Economy in Transition\u0027Let\u0027s get real, as the kids say. If Israel fails to get Washington to go to war with Iran, it will have lost a very big bet. More fantasizing will not get it out of that hole.
