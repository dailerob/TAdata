{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressThis week, we were faced with the daunting prospect of having to make sense out of all the Hillary Clinton think pieces that were microwaved into existence after she decided to formally enter the 2016 presidential race. And there were so many pieces of \"think\" to go through! Millions of microscopic particles of thinking! It was all way too tiresome. So, in lieu of adding to an already crowded canon, what follows is a Frankenstein\u0027s monster of everyone else\u0027s hasty Hillary musings. It is one brutal Hillary Clinton think piece to rule them all.At first, I leaned toward keeping our kids vaccine-free. I thought the concern about vaccination made sense. But after hearing both sides of the argument, I decided facts were my friends. I couldn\u0027t rely on word-of-mouth, friend-of-a-friend information. It was going to require actual research from vetted sources; I wanted the truth.Mother, ActressRacism, homophobia, the refusal to regard women as equals -- these beliefs will only end if we keep talking about why and how they\u0027re problematic, and force those who hold them to own them -- and face the consequences.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarIf we play it right and if we listen carefully to what our Arab partners are saying to us, the Iran deal can open the door to constructive discussions with allied Arab leaders that will enhance the prospects of peace and stability across the region. My concerns are not with the deal itself, but with how it was done.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Five years after the BP blowout that killed 11 workers and dumped millions of barrels of oil in the Gulf of Mexico, the Obama administration has proposed exposing Atlantic and Arctic waters to the risk of a similar disaster. It\u0027s time to turn this ship around -- before it\u0027s too late.Former President, NRDCWhile the technology has changed, our constitutional rights haven\u0027t. But how do we translate long-standing free speech and privacy protections at a time when anyone with a mobile phone has the potential to engage in an act of journalism?Senior Director of Strategy, Free PressAfter baring my head and living my life as a bald woman for over two decades, I\u0027ve realized that beauty cannot not be measured by others, and only you can choose fight or flight.On a mission to inspire others to love and accept themselves just as they are.Less than one week into Hillary Clinton\u0027s presidential campaign and it\u0027s a blurry image from a fast-food restaurant security video that\u0027s emerged as the defining media image.Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaIn a nation where millions of working families still can\u0027t earn enough to pay rent, pay the bills, and put food on the table at the same time -- and where in fiscal year 2013 there were 4.9 million households with no income but SNAP, including 1.3 million households with children -- relying on the charity of PB and J Day is not a substitute for justice.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe first year of our son\u0027s life was the most difficult of our marriage to date and it is also the year I learned a very important lesson: My husband must always come before our children. Don\u0027t get me wrong; I love my kids and would do anything for them. But I love my husband more.Our mission is to help people love their best.Hillary Rodham Clinton is running for President. Let the questions begin. My question is, will she be good for public education? Clinton\u0027s track record hasn\u0027t brought her into education issues very often. But there is one huge honking squealing flashing siren wrapped in a fluorescent red flag atop a high-powered blinking crimson light.Teacher and writer; blogger, curmudgucation.blogspot.comWhen it comes to what goes on in the marble corridors of the Federal Reserve, Americans tend to be suspicious. For different reasons, both the right and the left have challenged Fed policies aimed at bolstering the economy in the wake of the Great Recession.Author and cultural theoristWarren\u0027s series of proposed reforms would be a major and much needed boost to an economy still held down by the Wall Street abuses that brought on the collapse of the massive housing bubble, the 2008 financial collapse, and the hardest hitting economic slowdown since the Great Depression.Co-Founder, Democracy PartnersReading blogs, watching videos on YouTube, or reading a book unrelated to your work are all things that really career-focused people sometimes see as wasting time. But actually, these activities can help us discover new things, make new connections, come up with innovative solutions, and challenge our current thinking.Best-Selling Author, Keynote Speaker and Leading Business and Data ExpertPay now or pay later the saying goes. But in global education it is more serious than that. We can either increase overall ambition and resources to reflect the scale and urgency of the challenge of out-of-school children or lose actual children, communities, and in some cases entire countries because of the failure of our leaders to match their rhetoric with investments.Director, Policy and Advocacy - A World at School; Director, Policy and Research - Global Business Coalition for EducationSometimes the selfies are silly. Sometimes the selfies are sweet. Sometimes the selfies are vain. But regardless of what the selfies are, they are always me. My selfies are a constant reminder to me (and to my loved ones) that I\u0027m not just seeing our life together, but that I\u0027m part of it, too.Founder/blogger, Froggy \u0026 The Mouse\"Right now, if I want to find out what\u0027s going on in Ukraine or Syria or Washington, I read the New York Times, other national newspapers, I look at the Associated Press wires, I read the British press, and so on. I use Google all the time, I\u0027m happy it\u0027s there. But just as when I read the New York Times or the Washington Post, or the Wall Street Journal knowing that they have ways of selecting and shaping the material that reaches you, you have to compensate for it.\"CEO of BylineWhat better way to celebrate spring than with an outdoor feast? Think outside the lunchbox and try one of these delicious, easy-to-transport dishes for your next picnic.Chef, Recipe Developer, Busy MomAlmost every time I go out in the gayborhood, I experience some form of ageism. Age shouldn\u0027t matter -- because it doesn\u0027t. It\u0027s the 21st century, and the only things truly dated about us are our idealisms.Writer, Night Owl, Sloth EnthusiastI have noticed how often I -- and my female friends -- apologize for things that are out of our control. This, of course, is different than saying, \"I am sorry for being late,\" or \"I\u0027m sorry I picked a fight last night because I was really hungry and you were taking forever to figure out our plans.\"Senior Editor, Los AngelesWhen we have complicated trade agreements that could put thousands of U.S. workers on the unemployment line and hamper this nation\u0027s economy, shouldn\u0027t our elected officials have a chance to review and make changes to them? After all, lawmakers have certainly spent significant time considering more frivolous matters in recent years.General President, International Brotherhood of TeamstersNo white wedding cakes here! Redefine what it is to have a wedding cake with one of these outside-the-box ideas.The go-to guide for all things weddingsDetermined to find solutions to the injustice I\u0027d experienced, I decided to pursue my education and become a criminal-defense attorney. I took my first job out of law school representing death-row inmates in California.National Director, #cut50In the Toy Story films, the primary personal relationship on display is friendship. And yet, although the films are not romances, there are more realistic representations of romantic love threaded through the three movies than you\u0027ll find in a multiplex full of romantic comedies.WidowerWe need to create a society where girls and women are getting the same encouragement and support to build their careers as the boys and men are. From the start. That\u0027s just my #78cents.Actor, \u0027OITNB\u0027 \u0026 \u0027HTGAWM\u0027When you\u0027re challenging the gods, and those who claim to speak for the gods, you are always punching up.President, Foundation for Individual Rights in EducationMany of our manufacturers are already facing unfair trade practices that are costing jobs. And so far there is nothing in the fast-track bill or TPP to give them any hope that the scenario would change.President, Alliance for American ManufacturingMuch of the buzz around the 2014 Induction Ceremony centered on who -- if anyone -- would perform songs from Nirvana\u0027s celebrated catalog. Inductees Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic, as well as longtime Nirvana rhythm player (and Germs punk) Pat Smear were on hand, ready to play, but who would bravely fill the impossibly large shoes of departed frontman Kurt Cobain?Sleep problems can set teens up for increased risk of substance use and abuse and the dangerous behaviors associated with alcohol and drugs. Poor and insufficient sleep also makes teens more likely to experience other health problems.Clinical Psychologist; Board Certified Sleep SpecialistMuch has been done since then to increase security and safety around federal buildings. Sadly, there has been no such progress in eliminating the types of anti-government sentiments that drove domestic terrorists Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols to target federal government employees on that fateful day.National President, American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIOI\u0027m not getting all morbid on you, people, but it occurred to me that there are things in life that I want to do that I haven\u0027t done. Some people call it a bucket list.
