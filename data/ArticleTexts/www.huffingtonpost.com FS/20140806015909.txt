{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"lincolnmitchell.comThe relationship between Israel and the people of Gaza, and indeed with Palestinians more broadly, has been caught in a miserable and deadly cycle for years. A conflict is followed by a period of unfruitful peace talks, continued Israeli settlements, a violent act of some kind, Hamas shooting rockets into Israel and then a deadly Israeli offensive into Gaza leading to civilian casualties and global outrage against Israel. This latest military conflict in Gaza may have brought this cycle to its breaking point. The transformation, albeit in the very early stages, of the U.S.-Israel relationship, isolation of Hamas and changing allegiances in the Middle East suggest that something will have to give.The nuclear weapons era opened on August 6, 1945, the first day of the countdown to what may be the inglorious end of this strange species, which attained the intelligence to discover the effective means to destroy itself, but -- so the evidence suggests -- not the moral and intellectual capacity to control its worst instincts.Institute Professor emeritus, MIT Department of Linguistics and PhilosophyThere is no question that Africa faces many serious issues on the road to development. But a new reality is emerging. It is time for perceptions to change as well.UN Messenger of PeaceThe world is aflame. Religious minorities are among those who suffer most from increasing conflict. Pakistan is one of the worst homes for non-Muslims. The U.S. government should designate that nation as a \"Country of Particular Concern\" for failing to protect religious liberty, the most basic right of conscience.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteOn issue after issue facing our country, this is a Republican Party so obsessed with blocking the president -- and now suing the president -- that it has abdicated its most basic responsibility to govern.U.S. Senator from CaliforniaAs an autism parent, it offends me that my children\u0027s condition is being used to scare people away from life-saving medical treatments.Freelance writer and mother to three childrenAbandon the cultural myth that all female friendships must be bitchy, toxic, or competitive. This myth is like heels and purses -- pretty but designed to SLOW women down.Author, An Untamed State and AyitiFocusing on issues of character and choice, when discussing poverty, suits conservatives because it emphasizes the causal role of \"agency\" rather than \"structure\" in the creation of social problems.Worrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsNever get married because you think it\u0027s time; get married because you\u0027ve found the right person -- no matter how much time that takes.Psychotherapist, AuthorThe Republican Leadership may be doing just fine with the Wall Street crowd and extremists who oppose birth control, but for the majority of ordinary Americans its actions over the last several weeks have rapidly begun to seal its fate as a minority party.Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersWe veterans will always be bound together by a very special bond. That will never be broken. But that doesn\u0027t mean we have to all endorse the positions or candidacy of every veteran, just because they are a veteran.Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranThe betrayal of intellectuals has been especially noticeable during the days of the operation in Gaza. I don\u0027t accuse intellectuals of bias or of anti-Semitism but too many of them are certainly guilty of intellectual laziness.Israel\u0027s Minister of Finance and the head of Yesh Atid, Israel\u0027s second largest political partyGaza is no stranger to bouts of violence and periods of intense instability, but I have never been there to experience it. Suburban America had sheltered me, but that was all over. My thoughts are still a whirlwind, but my feelings have never been more clear.Optometry student, University of Houston College of Optometry; co-founder, Dunia HealthThe global hunger issue can seem overwhelming. The fact that more people will die from hunger this year than AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and war combined is unbelievable. I\u0027ve seen the emotional and physical toll hunger takes on the communities and families it impacts.Performer and volunteer spokesperson for World Hunger ReliefIn the summer of 1964, nearly 1,000 college students from across the country traveled to Mississippi to carry out a dangerous mission. For 10 harrowing weeks over what came to be known as Mississippi Freedom Summer, they worked to help African American citizens exercise their Constitutional right to vote.PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorFreelance writerCivilians need to understand -- the biggest problem with the destruction of tenure is not that a handful of teachers will lose their jobs, but that entire buildings full of teachers will lose the freedom to do their jobs well.Teacher and writer; blogger, curmudgucation.blogspot.comRunners will appreciate that the Sproing Trainer was designed with them in mind as a way to build endurance and strength without the pain that can come with pounding the pavement.Senior Lifestyle Blog Editor, The Huffington PostOverall, NATO remains militarily ready, but politically faltering.Professor of International Security, Editor of European Security at University of BathOne thing cancer cannot do is lessen the courage and fight a person has in them. Now I\u0027m 17, a year we weren\u0027t sure I\u0027d live to see. Not only am I a childhood cancer survivor, I am still standing.17-year-old Ambassador for Stand Up To CancerThe troubles in Toledo this weekend might seem the stuff of science fiction, but the truth is that a major American city, perched along the Great Lakes just went three days without drinking water after pollution poisoned their supply.Natural Resources Defense Council Midwest Program DirectorI sit at my desk again now to answer the question, \"Why would I pursue ordination after all the pain my Church has put me and my family through?\"WriterIncarcerated youth are teenagers, and may exhibit the same impulsivity, moodiness and oppositional behavior known to parents everywhere. The idea that these challenges require the routine use of pepper spray is mistaken and harmful.Staff Attorney at the San Francisco-based Youth Law CenterThere is certainly no basis for either fear of, or opposition to, the on-going treatment of an infected American doctor in Atlanta. We may instead all be thankful that in return for the courageous service he was providing in Liberia, Dr. Brantly is now receiving an American standard of medical care himselfDirector, Yale Prevention Research CenterThe corporate under-written Common Core standards and tests are at best a distraction and at worse add grievous insult to injury for children of color.Co-Founder, Network for Public EducationAssistant Professor and Deputy Chair in the Department of Puerto Rican \u0026 Latin@ Studies at Brooklyn College (City University of New York)Many in the financial industry couldn\u0027t care less about unemployment. They don\u0027t want to risk any inflation that could erode the value of their wealth. Their voices are being heard at the top levels of the Fed. It is essential that the broader public get involved in this debate as well.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027We can all be heroes flying in stealth mode, capturing the hearts and minds of our fellow Americans, leaving no room for Osama\u0027s ghost and the racism and xenophobia that continues to haunt us.Editorial cartoonistI imagined that the battle between Sega and Nintendo would be similar to the classic rivalry between Magic Johnson and Larry Bird: a story of two great competitors who ultimately gain respect for each other.author, filmmaker, teddy bear enthusiastLast week Woody Allen finally \"broke his silence\" regarding his casting of or, lack of African-Americans. Why the world felt it necessary to hold the director of \"Scoop\" and \"Cassandra\u0027s Dream\" accountable for the lack of African-Americans in cinema is a little beyond me.Host, HuffPost LiveThe first African-American president has been painted as opposing the interests of white people, and while Glenn Beck has stated this verbatim, this sentiment has been a cornerstone of Tea Party politics.Author and Journalist published in Salon.com, the Jerusalem Post, Chicago Tribune, The Hill\u0027s Congress Blog, and other publications. www.hagoodman.comIf the next world war is to happen, it will most likely be in Asia and feature a clash between the incumbent hegemon, the United States, and the principal challenger, China. The good news is China does not want war now and in the foreseeable future, primarily because Beijing knows too well that the odds are not on its side. But if we look ahead 20 years from now, in 2034, the odds will have shifted significantly.Professor Far Eastern Federal University, Vladivostok, Russia \u2028Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"NEW SNOWDEN?",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
