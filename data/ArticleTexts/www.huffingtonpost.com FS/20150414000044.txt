{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureWith a rhetorical bow to Elizabeth Warren, Hillary launched her presidential campaign yesterday in a terrific 2-minute-and-18-second video while heading to Iowa for a series of \"intimate\" meetings with voters. Then came the din. TV talk shows went Hillary 24/7, featuring heated exchanges of talking points between legions of Republican and Democratic \"strategists.\" MSM reporters charted her potential course to the nomination, an early start to horse-race reporting. Progressive listservs, buzzing about how to relate to her candidacy for months, went into overdrive. So before the babble stupefies, here are five simple propositions about the challenges facing Hillary\u0027s candidacy.Hillary Clinton\u0027s campaign announcement is an insult to the presidency. It represents a total capitulation to the political consulting business -- two-and-a-half minutes of marketing images, without anything resembling serious argument.Professor of law and political science, Yale; Author \u0027The Decline and Fall of the American Republic\u0027If we are going to ask our students to work hard and achieve the American Dream, we must do our part to ensure that they have the resources they need. We can start by investing in our schools.U.S. Representative for California\u0027s 27th DistrictIran has been one of Washington\u0027s chief antagonists for nearly four decades. But a broad deal to keep Tehran from building nuclear weapons has been reached. Alas, any accord will face significant opposition. Some Americans -- including many Republican members of Congress--fear peace more than war.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteHillary Clinton has always been a divisive figure in American politics. But love her or hate her, she\u0027s now a two-time Presidential candidate. Perhaps the some of her divisiveness comes from the struggle many ambitious women experience: The complex push-and-pull between who she is, who she wants to be and what society expects her to be.Senior Data Scientist, Huffington PostThe news -- any news -- makes the case. We look to be in the same slow spiral down, where world-threatening unraveling is as loudly addressed as it is unattended.Professor at The Johns Hopkins University Advanced Academic Programs and the US Naval War CollegeThe president can continue the fight for fast-track and the TPP, raising corporate profits while putting good manufacturing jobs and wages at risk. Or he can take action to create jobs and reduce inequality. He can\u0027t do both.Director of Trade and Manufacturing Policy Research, Economic Policy InstituteThe Iranian nuclear psycho-drama is nearly over - barring a fatal Congressional mutiny. A great feat of escaping from a perilous situation we concocted ourselves. Meanwhile, the Middle East is ablaze.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghRacial and ethnic disparities in healthcare are complex and there is no one silver bullet. That\u0027s why we will continue to work in every area of our healthcare system to find and eliminate racial and ethnic barriers to good health.Secretary of Health \u0026 Human Services (HHS)Clinton\u0027s strategy isn\u0027t just about winning over the progressive base. It\u0027s about energizing the electorate. But the devil will be in the details.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The combination of gesturing towards what are usually called \"important ethical issues,\" while steadfastly putting off serious discussion of them, is pretty typical in our technology debates.Visiting Fellow, James Madison Program in American Ideals and Institutions, Princeton UniversityWe are a long way from justice and this case will have to work its way through the prosecutor, jury selection and trial, but just the contrast of this tragic incident and that of Garner\u0027s death and others is remarkable.President, National Action NetworkIn late February, Sen. Barbara Boxer, Sen. Ed Markey, and I sent a letter to 100 organizations affiliated with the fossil fuel industry asking whether they spent money to support climate research. That letter provoked a torrent of criticism from conservative groups and publications mischaracterizing our motives and muddling our message. I\u0027d like to set the record straight.Democratic Senator from Rhode IslandWhile we know how much insurers and oil and gas companies dole out to political campaigns and lobbyists, we don\u0027t have a clue how much of their cash is used to establish front groups or how much of it winds up in the pockets of either pundits for hire or tax-exempt organizations that do their bidding.Author, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgMy OCD convinced me that when I walked into a room, those people were talking about me, and I knew it. It forces me to revisit the same distressing ideas day after day with no reprieve. It isolated me and made me irritable. I lashed out at those I loved, oftentimes irreparably so. The spread of misinformation is harmful to us all, and we should seek to understand before we label.Writer, history-buff, and activist.On opening day, rejoice that the fundamentals that America\u0027s pastime and American democracy share -- character, support, versatility, endurance and diversity -- strengthen and enrich us all. In that spirit, play ball!Chair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusA government agency with a salary structure that makes it nearly impossible to compete against the best legal and accounting firms in the country in the best of times is being forced to fire staff, furlough its remaining employees and subject those who remain to ever-increasing workloads while at the same time the complexity of that workload is increasing exponentially.Senior fellow, Center for American ProgressIt seems that WND has declared a total blackout on treating Cruz the way it did Obama where eligibility is concerned -- and even WND\u0027s chief birther is compelled to play along. All of which hammers home the message that WND cares about the Constitution only when it can be used as a cudgel against its political enemies, not as a document to be applied evenly to all.Founder and Editor, ConWebWatch.com; former senior editor, Media MattersIt struck me that if indeed America delivers a battle between its contemporary political aristocracies, the Bushes and the Clintons, that the challenge for Hillary will be to overcome comparisons not with her Republican rival but with her peripatetic global do-gooding husband.Washington Editor at Large of The Atlantic and founder and senior fellow of the American Strategy Program at the New America Foundation.Latinas are the lowest paid workers in the country. In general, women earn 78 cents for every dollar paid to their male counterparts. For Latinas, the wage gap is even more severe: we\u0027re paid 56 cents for every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men.U.S. Representative, California’s 38th district; Chairwoman, Congressional Hispanic CaucusIf the United States Congress manages to kill the nuclear deal, international support for the sanctions that have brought Iran to the negotiating table will collapse, and the hardliners in Iran who want a nuclear bomb will be strengthened politically and emboldened to race for a bomb.Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersThe Supreme Court\u0027s ruling in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby last summer, recognizing for the first time a (closely held) for-profit corporation\u0027s claim of religious belief, has only fueled the flames of possibility for religious conservatives. That was the beginning, setting the table for the resistance.Executive Director, Gender Rights MarylandI continue to worry about what I have referred to in past posts as \"the age of insanity.\" Recently I met with R.H. Flutes, my old friend from the Lying Institute of America. Dr. R.H. Flutes was in a jubilant mood because his former student, Ted Cruz, was on the presidential campaign trail.Academy Award-winning director, screenwriter and producerI found myself replaying that moment in my mind: a silent flight line shadowed by distant mountains. The rugged peaks stood like sentries along the horizon, making everything seem tiny and insignificant set against them.We create a space for veterans and civilians to talk about conflict and literature.Three of the progressive movements that are most active right now are Black Lives Matter, the push for LGBT rights, and the push for a minimum/living wage. Each of these movements is powerful on its own. Working together, they can achieve much more. And they are coming together.Author of \u0027Obama’s America: A Transformative Vision of Our National Identity\u0027Gender diverse people are human beings of innate worth and intrinsic value. They deserve the same rights as every other citizen under the law. That includes the right to employment based on merit and the ability to do the job.Author, \u0027The Complete Guide to Transgender in the Workplace\u0027Paul is a divisive politician, beloved by younger Republicans, untrusted by religious and social conservatives and feared by the party establishment. Yet it is his non-interventionist worldview that represents the biggest threat, particularly to the neocons for whom perpetual war offers the healthiest returns.Night Editor, The Huffington Post UKIn a classic tale of unintended consequences, just about every time Washington has committed another blunder in the Middle East, Iran has stepped in to take advantage.Author of \"Ghosts of Tom Joad: A Story of the #99Percent\" and \"We Meant Well\"Let\u0027s be real: If we can\u0027t end mountaintop removal, a cancer-linked extreme form of mining that only provides a fraction of our national coal production, how can we expect to move forward on climate change and public health?Author of \"Reckoning at Eagle Creek,\" and \"United States of Appalachia\" www.jeffbiggers.comEnvironmentalist, human rights advocate, documentary photographer.Raises would, of course, cost these billion-dollar corporations something. More costly, though, is the price paid by minimum-wage workers who have not received a raise in six years. Even more dear is what these workers have paid for their campaign to get raises. Managers have harassed, threatened and fired them.International President, United SteelworkersGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"THE RACE REVS UP",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
