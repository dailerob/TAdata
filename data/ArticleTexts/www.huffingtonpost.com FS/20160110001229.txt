{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Children\u0027s Defense FundLegislative action to strengthen huge weaknesses in our nation’s gun laws is still required but the president\u0027s common-sense executive actions move us in the right direction. Several measures highlight one of the key components of our gun violence crisis: that much gun violence begins at home. So many wrongly believe that gun violence happens mostly “out on the streets” and others believe owning a gun will protect their family from gun violence. The opposite is true: A gun in the home increases the risk of homicide, suicide, and accidental death. Guns lethalize anger, domestic disputes, mental illness and despair. A gun in the home makes the likelihood of homicide three times higher, suicide three to five times higher, and accidental death four times higher.On Tuesday, January 12, when you deliver your final State of the Union address, you will have a tremendous opportunity to establish a profound legacy regarding one of the nation\u0027s most important domestic programs -- Social SecurityFounding Co-director, Social Security WorksToday, my kids are deemed \"golden\" and \"adorable\" and \"sweet\" because they look the way society has decided children should look. In a few years, as they grow into black young adults and men, that same line of superficial reasoning will mark them as dangerous.Media funded and run by women.A wave of pessimism leads capable people to underestimate the power of their voice and the strength of their ideals. The truth is this: It is the initiatives of deeply caring people that provide the firmament for our democracy.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorIn addition to serious questions about use of force and why another unarmed person of color has died at the hands of Denver law enforcement, his case illustrates several systemic deficiencies of our criminal justice system, both in Denver and nationwide.Executive Director, ACLU of ColoradoNo one saw this disaster coming, but that\u0027s no excuse for letting the next one happen. Let President Obama know that it\u0027s time for the entire country to adopt strong safeguards against methane leaks from aging oil and gas infrastructure like that in Aliso Canyon.Executive Director, The Sierra ClubDr. Larycia Hawkins is loving her Muslim neighbors as herself at a time when I will admit - we can use some neighborly love. And Dr. Hawkins could be losing her job for it. Is it really necessary for Wheaton College to nitpick the nuances of the differences between Christianity and Islam?Writer, Activist, MomMaine\u0027s Governor Paul LePage is no stranger to making crazy comments in public that are unbecoming to an elected official, but his latest racist rant about heroin use in his state is rightfully getting people up in arms.Managing Director of Communications, Drug Policy AllianceFuture economic historians may not call the period that began in 2007 \"The Greatest Depression.\" But as of now it is highly and increasingly probable that they will call it \"The Longest Depression.\" So what can be done?Professor of economics, U.C. BerkeleyThe U.S.-led order for the region established in the 1990s was bound to collapse. It was based on the exclusion of two of the Mideast\u0027s most powerful states -- Iran and Iraq -- and could only be sustained as long as the U.S. was willing to pay for it through its own blood and treasure. The influence and privilege Saudi Arabia enjoyed under American order will no longer be the same -- because that order is no more.President, National Iranian American CouncilHeroin has taken so much from me over the years. Time I can never get back. People I will never see again. Memories I never had a chance to make. And the craziest part of all of this? I never touched the stuff myself.Writer, Champagne Sipper, French-Fry Lover, Curly-Haired Person. Instagram: @thealiciacookAs the Supreme Court hears this case on Monday, that day will mark the beginning of a week of action to ensure that the public is aware of what\u0027s at stake: the ability of workers to stand up for themselves and for the people they serve.Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureWith presidential primaries fast approaching, Republican voters should be asking themselves a few provocative questions about their front-runners and their party. Are conservatives in the United States so bereft of ideas that their only response to global climate change is to pretend it doesn\u0027t exist?Executive Director, Presidential Climate Action ProjectWarm desserts that pair soft, tart fruit with buttery-crisp toppings are some of my favorite things to bake. They\u0027re perfect for using up seasonal fruit, easy to throw together, and always comforting.Chef, Recipe Developer and Busy MomMuslim millennials are committed to their faith; recognized a need for renewal in Muslim discourse; saw a need for a more visible role for women in religious life; believed that religion would play an important part in their country\u0027s future; and rejected extremist groups as a perversion of their faith.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027To put this in a religious context: overcoming the divisions of race has been central to the church since its beginning, and the dynamic diversity of the body of Christ is one of the most powerful forces in the global church. Our Christian faith stands fundamentally opposed to racism in all its forms, which contradict the good news of the gospel.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersNo one ought to have the right to manufacture and sell weapons of mass destruction to anyone other than the military, and those weapons should not be able to leave a military base under penalty of law.Actress and authorMore than half a million of the poorest Americans will lose a critical tool to help keep food on the table this year. That\u0027s because a three-month limit on SNAP (food stamps) for jobless adults aged 18-49 who aren\u0027t disabled or raising minor children is returning in 23 states for the first time since the Great Recession.Senior Policy AnalystNever did I consider that something so unthinkable -- selling kids for sex -- was happening in my own community. But I was wrong. I was naive. I was unwilling to face the facts. Until last year.ActressIt should come as no surprise, then, that stormtroopers and dinosaurs -- fairy tale visions conjured decades ago, and at great effort, by George Lucas and Steven Spielberg -- are still ruling the box office today.Director and WriterAs a former director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service who was responsible for the conservation and stewardship of the entire National Wildlife Refuge System, I am appalled by the illegal armed occupation of Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in southeastern Oregon.President \u0026 CEO, Defenders of Wildlife2015 was a good year for job growth. By the end of the year, the tightening job market finally started showing signs of generating some wage pressures. But we\u0027ve got a ways to go before the economy\u0027s growth is broadly shared.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThe irony is that the plethora of choices is making our head spin, and giving us an even harder time making or sticking to a decision. We are in a constant state of anxiety where we never know if we are doing our best or having the best that we should and must have.Writer, Merman \u0026 Your GBF (Twitter \u0026 IG @KeayNigel)Increasing Islamic extremism has contributed to the political gains of the far right, which also has a long history of anti-Semitism. The mutual reinforcement of these movements -- with the far right contributing to radicalization among French Muslims -- is not good for the Jews nor does it augur well for democratic values.National Director and CEO of the Anti-Defamation LeaguePresident of CRIF, the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in FranceAll relationships have their ups and downs.

That profit is wasted money that should be spent on improving conditions inside and outside prisons, rather than on covering up the symptoms of a broken system.Executive Director, In the Public InterestA vibrant and dynamic faith institution should acknowledge that whether Christians and Muslims worship the same God is a legitimate and unsettled question for many faithful Christian believers.Leadership consultant, former Outward Bound wilderness guide, sportswriter, Deacon in Shiloh Baptist urban church, Trenton NJ, activist.Not saying what happened wasn\u0027t dangerous, but the fact is Koreans in less than a day have turned away from that news. To be honest, even the day it happened, people here didn\u0027t make a huge fuss about it.Editor in Chief, HuffPost KoreaThe market was supposed to save the planet.
