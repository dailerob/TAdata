Or, at least, they\u0027re not getting excited about dissecting his chicanery. Are you noticing this? CLIFF: I sadly have to agree. With the Obama/Hillary Thrilla in Manila still going on, it seems many have dug in and are more content to bash the other one than McCain. Which is a problem, as he is a scary guy, and people need to know it. I also think some may have internalized the media message. You know the \"he\u0027s not that bad for a Republican\" line or the \"he\u0027s an independent-minded guy\" David Brookisms.Read Post | CommentsBIOJon Soltz, 04.10.2008Here\u0027s the problem with President Bush\u0027s announced reduction in troop deployment times from 15 to 12 months: it\u0027s a PR stunt.
