{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Though the need for sleep has been a constant throughout human history, how we feel about it has gone through dramatic changes over the years. We\u0027re now in the process of renewing our estranged relationship, especially as science, in the last two decades or so, has validated much of the ancient wisdom about the importance of sleep.Now that we have the means to get, relative to most of human history, the most unprecedentedly blissful sleep ever, we should allow ourselves to enjoy it. We live in a time in which we\u0027re plugged in and hyperconnected, often from the moment we wake up until the instant we drift off. Let\u0027s savor and safeguard sleep, not just for its performance benefits but for the special way it allows us to connect with ourselves. During the daytime technology allows us to travel across distance and space, but during the nighttime our dreams allow us to travel across time, spanning and connecting different parts of ourselves, allowing our senses of intuition and wisdom to flourish.The richest Americans hold more of the nation\u0027s wealth than they have in almost a century. What do they spend it on? As you might expect, personal jets, giant yachts, works of art, and luxury penthouses. And also on politics.

Now some will make the classic switch, joining the ranks of the lobbyists of K Street.Author, \"Unaccountable\"Nonviolent direct action is a necessary, vital, and wholly American tool in forcing meaningful, permanent, transformative action from our leaders and fellow citizens. We are not concerned if this inconveniences you. Dead children are more than an inconvenience.Writer, Educator,EducatorJohnetta Elzie is a 25-year-old resident of St. Louis is a curator on the #Ferguson Protester Newsletter.All over the country black people have been stopped, harassed, arrested, injured and even killed at the hands of the police meant to protect them. From Brooklyn to Baltimore, Atlanta to Anaheim, cellphone videos are waking up the rest of the population to the fact that overly aggressive policing is not new in America, especially in black America.Journalist; Founder, Starfish Media GroupMr. Mayor, take some of our inspiration to heart and stand with us to fight Keystone XL, to fight for New York City and to deepen our progressive values as we move into the future.Writer/director, GaslandI once watched my father break up a fight. He was walking me home from school, and we passed by four boys on the sidewalk, three of them menacing the fourth, who was smaller and looked scared. Just as we approached, the biggest of the boys threw a punch at the little one, and it landed. Dad was outraged.Award-winning actress, author and activistIs there a line no writer should cross when writing grisly scenes? In my personal view -- and experience -- no. So long as you obey one rule, which is this: Does whatever you write drive your narrative forward?Outdoor photographer and wilderness travelerFor each modest step forward on climate stabilization, the latest election ensures that Americans are destined to march several steps backward when it comes to reliance on climate-altering fossil fuels. It\u0027s a recipe for good times for Big Energy and its congressional supporters and bad times for the rest of us.Author and Professor of Peace and World-Security Studies, Hampshire CollegeThe Keystone XL Pipeline debate is being called bad political theater as a way to discredit it and label it as just a symbolic fight. These are the times when presidential power can really mean something.Director and ProducerThe first thing you have to ask yourself is whether you have actually tried any of the tips that you have read, let alone performed them over a period of time where you could observe whether there was any effect or not.Startup founder, building builder, ex-philosopher.When there are enough witnesses who say Officer Darren Wilson acted improperly, then why not go to trial, allow both sides to present evidence and make their case, and then let that jury determine Wilson\u0027s guilt or innocence?President, National Action NetworkThis bill would bypass essential reviews, skip safety assessments, and fast track a dangerous project. This has sweeping implications for future generations. And yet it is entangled in the politics of the moment.President, NRDCThe risk of ISIS getting a nuclear bomb are small. But they are not zero.President, Ploughshares Fund; Author, \u0027Nuclear Nightmares: Securing the World Before It Is Too Late\u0027My interviews with middle-class Americans reveal that many are even more concerned with losing what they have than with gaining more of the same.Professor of international relations, George Washington UniversityA meritocracy that insist we have but one measure, and that everybody should be made to use that one standard and measure -- that\u0027s not a meritocracy. It\u0027s something darker, something uglier, something that is offensive both to human and (if you so believe) divine sensibilities.Teacher and writer; blogger, curmudgucation.blogspot.comFor 17 months, you have been very patient with House Republican leaders, encouraging them to either take up and pass the bipartisan Senate bill or work with you to craft a different bill.U.S. Senator from CaliforniaThis month in Boston, thousands of teachers will gather for the annual National Council for the Social Studies (NCSS) conference. Two non-teachers will be there, too: Charles and David Koch, the notorious right-wing billionaires.Co-director, Zinn Education Project; Curriculum editor, Rethinking SchoolsIt is a common mistake to overestimate the contribution of immigration to the increase in poverty.

Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorPresident Barack Obama finally is obeying the law. He wants Congress to authorize military action against the Islamic State. That\u0027s what the Constitution requires.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteIt\u0027s the same old song and dance -- corporations want more control at the expense of consumer choice and at the expense of a fair market.

It has also done more.
