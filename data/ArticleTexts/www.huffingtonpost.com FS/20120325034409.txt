{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOOn Friday, President Obama took two important steps with respect to the world\u0027s premier development agency: He chose a \"development professional\" as America\u0027s nominee, and he stressed that the Bank\u0027s leader should have a deep understanding of \"the role development plays in the world.\" Let us hope that this is reflected not just in the ultimate selection, but also in how the process breaks away from the old and harmful approach based on nationality and political favors.Read Post | Comments (15)Marian Wright Edelman, 03/23/12President, Children\u0027s Defense FundWhere is the outrage over every single one of the thousands of children and teens killed by guns -- too many by gun slinging Americans unrestrained by common sense gun control laws.Read Post | Comments (619)Arianna Huffington, 03/22/12Smart delevering isn\u0027t just about cutting -- and the relentless emphasis on cutting has obscured the more important question of what is being cut.
