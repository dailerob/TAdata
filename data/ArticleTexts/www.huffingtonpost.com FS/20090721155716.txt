{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOPOMPEII -- Walking around the ancient city of Pompeii, reading up on its history, and thinking of its people -- wiped out in 79 A.D. by a volcanic eruption -- got me thinking about unheeded warning signs. In the case of Pompeii, these signs included a severe earthquake, dogs running away, and columns of smoke belching out of Mount Vesuvius. But these warning signs were ignored, and the volcano blew its top, burying the city and its inhabitants under 60 feet of ash and volcanic rock. There is currently plenty of alarming smoke pouring out of our economic Vesuvius -- including rising unemployment, record bankruptcies, record credit card defaults, and record home foreclosures. But the warning signs are once again being ignored.Read Post | CommentsBIOMitchell Bard, 07.20.2009Writer and FilmmakerWe are either going to get no health care reform or watered-down health care legislation that acts as a bandage, helping some people but ignoring the larger problem creating the pain.Read Post | Comments (204)BIORichard Kirsch, 07.21.2009National Campaign Manager, Health Care for America NowNow is the time for bold action to make good, affordable health care a right.
