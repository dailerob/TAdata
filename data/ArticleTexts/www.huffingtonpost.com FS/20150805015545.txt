{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Some progressives expressed dismay last week to discover that Bernie Sanders doesn\u0027t favor a policy of open immigration. While such a policy would undoubtedly allow billions of people in the developing world to improve their lives, there are not many people in the United States who relish the idea of the country\u0027s population tripling or quadrupling over the next three or four decades. It is hard to justify people in the United States living so much better and longer lives than people in places like Bangladesh or Burundi, just like it\u0027s hard to justify the children of the rich and privileged in the United States living so much better and longer lives than their poorer counterparts, but there is not a plausible story where this inequality will be addressed by mass immigration.In 40 years of dealing with presidents, prime ministers and other leaders, I could count on one hand the times I have heard a president or a prime minister or other high official speak candidly about the mistakes their country has made.

And, it\u0027s not surprising that most employees at any company in the world want to perform well and be highly engaged. Since we have the same goals, why is it so hard to reach the outcome we all desire?Chief Human Resources Officer, AccentureNine news outlets, including Politico and the Washington Post, have been given access to the Koch brothers donor fest -- on the condition that they not report on the identities of donors without their permission.Executive producer and host, The Undercurrent, part of Lady Libertine MediaHere we are, 70 years after the nuclear obliteration of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and I\u0027m wondering if we\u0027ve come even one step closer to a moral reckoning with our status as the world\u0027s only country to use atomic weapons to slaughter human beings.Professor of History, University of Massachusetts; Author, \"American Reckoning: The Vietnam War and Our National Identity\"Iran, like Iraq\u0027s Saddam Hussein, wants us to believe that it is close since that makes Iran both powerful (scary) and that threat provides great leverage in dealing with the rest of the world.Host, Fox News\u0027 \u0027On the Record With Greta Van Susteren\u0027We can guess what you\u0027re thinking.

While Trump can\u0027t be ignored, he can be exposed.Founder, Practically RepublicanMy secret lover, John Deere, and I are extremely grateful that Rep.

It is with enormous pride that I post the following announcementProfessor of Theater, Ursinus CollegeWithout an inchoate caliphate, ISIS becomes another bunch of terrorists roaming in the area, competing with several others.ISIS can be defeated, and quite readily. It set itself up as an easier target than other terrorist groups when it defined itself as seeking to found a state, governed in line with its particular interpretation of Islam.Professor of international relations, George Washington UniversityI\u0027ve received emails from readers informing me that my writing contradicts itself.

Progressive. Advocate. Mother. Former Planned Parenthood Policy Director. Attorney.We\u0027ve all had days when we wanted to give up. Breastfeeding isn\u0027t all or nothing. It looks different for each mom and baby. And it is never anyone\u0027s place to judge a mom who chooses not to breastfeed. Whether or not you breastfed or were breastfed matters in many ways, and in many ways it doesn\u0027t matter at all.Mom, writer, lactation consultant (IBCLC)Any order that\u0027s too off-menu will have to be DIY.

It was lots more than that.Investigative historianMUMBAI -- The Gurdaspur attack should remove any doubt that Pakistan\u0027s men on horseback do not want peace with India.
