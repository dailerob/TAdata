{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Chief Operating Officer, FacebookWe\u0027ve all had New Year\u0027s resolutions that we\u0027ve broken. One year, I resolved to learn how to touch-type instead of hunting and pecking for each key. How\u0027d that turn out? I am hunting and pecking this right now. Another year, I vowed to take piano lessons; I didn\u0027t make it through January. Time and time again when I went for it alone, I\u0027d get busy or just let it go. But the resolution I kept? Two years ago, I was with my childhood girlfriends for New Year\u0027s Eve and said I wanted to keep a journal of the milestones in my children\u0027s lives. One of them suggested that I share some of it with them every month. They held me accountable, cheering me on when I sent entries and reminding me when I fell behind. A year later, I was still going strong.We\u0027ve made progress this year -- raising the minimum wage in dozens of states and cities, providing equal marriage rights in a majority of states, limiting carbon emissions. But there\u0027s far more to do.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Rather than feeling deflated and defeated by the passing of any stage in life, we might better direct our energy to the challenges before us. As with each New Year, every major life transition should be a time to think about what we have gained and celebrate our progress.Psychotherapist; Executive/life coachLike many moms, I am often so worried about wrapping presents, preparing the holiday dinner and making sure everyone is happy that making sure everyone is healthy doesn\u0027t always make it to the top of the list.National Sounds of Pertussis® Campaign Ambassador, actress and mother of twoWhen anyone of us resolves toward self-improvement, it can impact the lives of those we love. How much more impact can we have, if in the new year we work to recreate the future of this country we love, by resolving to take bold steps in a new direction in a new year?Former 16-year member of the U.S. Congress and two-time U.S. presidential candidateLet me be frank: Losing weight is not going to make you eternally happy. Temporarily, your pants size may be smaller, but all of your problems will remain.Senior at Barnard College. paulinapinsky.wordpress.comI\u0027ve decided it\u0027s time to fight back and take action against my digital overlords. However, the reality is I actually love these digital distractions, so rather than going cold turkey, I\u0027ve come up with a realistic 12-step plan to a healthier and more productive life in this digital world.Brand \u0026 Digital StrategistAll three meanings of \"resolution\" are wonderfully attractive to me -- and timely for this brand new year.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersDespite the House Republican leadership\u0027s vigorous defense of Scalise Tuesday on the notion that the appearance was a regrettable, long ago, solitary honest mistake by a decent public servant important, uncomfortable questions remain.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityAs we enter the new year, we are inundated with thoughts about things we want to achieve in the next year. Often we set our sights so high that by mid-January we have given up. But that\u0027s no reason to stop trying! Here are 10 ideas and thoughts that anyone can achieve.Spiritual life coach, TV personality and author, \u0027But You Knew That Already: What a Psychic Can Teach You About Life\u0027At stake is whether the Internet remains a democratic, user-powered network -- or falls under the control of a few powerful entities.Senior Director of Strategy, Free PressMost people have horrible sleep fitness, so to speak. They waste time falling asleep, then they spend hours tossing and turning in a light sleep state that doesn\u0027t have the same body and brain-boosting benefits of deep and REM sleep.Author of The Bulletproof Diet and Inventor of Bulletproof Coffee. Entrepreneur turned biohacker who spent $300,000 to hack his own biology.Don\u0027t follow the crowds. Trying to emulate others deters you from that special path you were meant to take. Be inspired from their journey and put that energy into who you were meant to become.Travel and inspirational blogger, Founder of ThisWayNorth.netHow can it be that the head coach of the University of Michigan Wolverines is paid the same as the head coach of the San Francisco 49ers? The 49ers, after all, have yearly revenue in excess of $300 million. The Wolverines\u0027 revenue is closer to $50 million. Can the coach\u0027s incremental value really be similar in the two cases? No.Author of the forthcoming book \u0027Circus Maximus: The Economic Gamble Behind Hosting the Olympics and World Cup\u0027Normalizing both economic and diplomatic relations with Havana should be seen not as a victory for the Castro government, but for the people of Cuba. Liberty will come to that land. The only question is when. Expanding relations should help speed the process.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteYour body is not a problem to be solved. Your body is your home and regarding it as separate, problematic or disgusting can result in a type of detachment that interferes with your ability to hear its valuable messages to you. You need your body. It does not lie.We believe body trust is a birthright. Find our in-person and online programs at www.benourished.org.It is time to reject the failed policies of the past and chart a new course that will better serve America\u0027s interests and improve the lives of Cubans and their families. And President Obama\u0027s decision to normalize relations with Cuba is the right approach.U.S. Senator from CaliforniaThis year, Urban Outfitters sold a \"vintage\" Kent State sweatshirt tastefully splattered with red paint while Donald Sterling\u0027s racial comments cost him his NBA franchise. It\u0027s been a raucous year in the public arena, expressed perfectly by a parade of PR blunders that is as impressive in scope as it is in sheer absurdity.Media Relations proKindness is not the same as being nice. Kindness is an action that is motivated by empathy and compassion -- a sense of understanding and connection. We can be nice to others without the internal experience of genuinely hoping for their wellbeing.Internationally recognized teacher and coachSo what can we do to give ourselves our best chance of maintaining that loving feeling we have when we first realize we are falling for another person? Here are five resolutions I believe all couples would truly benefit from taking on.Psychology expert on relationships, parenting, self-destructive thoughts and suicide; author, \u0027Conquer Your Critical Voice\u0027Kiss someone at midnight.

It will start your 2015 off right!Event Designer2014 was no slouch year.

Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeIf our broken political system represents the greatest threat to the American enterprise and this country\u0027s future, where are the pictures? Why wouldn\u0027t this debacle be the source of endless feature images, slideshows, photo galleries of shame?Publisher of the visual politics and media literacy site, BagNewsNotesLucky is more than a dog; he is a symbol. For some, he is a symbol of resilience and perseverance, a canine \"It Gets Better\" story. For others, he is an affirmation of life and hope. To me, he is the best of what it means to be a dog: remaining positive, living in the moment, providing unconditional love.Professor of Theater, Ursinus CollegeThe state is unwilling to define reparative therapy and denial of medical care to transgender youths as abuse. We cannot change what religious leaders are preaching, nor do our voices carry enough weight to effectively gainsay their religious messaging. A radical new direction is needed. Therefore, I propose an emancipation project.Director of Advocacy, SPART*AGood posture, exercise, and a healthy lifestyle -- believe it or not, all of these things are important factors in avoiding back pain.
