{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jimmy SoniManaging Editor, the Huffington Post Media GroupIt\u0027s simple and painless to decry online toxicity; it\u0027s harder and more important to do something about it. We at The Huffington Post have chosen to take an affirmative step by verifying the identities of new commenter accounts. We won\u0027t eliminate every last note of negativity and nastiness on the site, but we believe this change will offer the guarantee of a gut check. Our hope is that this decision will lead to more of the robust conversations that we love having on HuffPost, and with that end in mind, we invite you to leave your comments below.Comments (756)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkHalf a century after Dr. King\u0027s momentous march, we must continue to push for justice and equality; anything less will be a disservice to the memory of this great leader and all those that paved the way 50 years ago.Comments (27)Maureen RyanTV critic, The Huffington PostMy jaw dropped when I realized what Walt was doing.Comments (397)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The wealth of the Walton family -- which still owns the lion\u0027s share of Walmart stock -- now exceeds the wealth of the bottom 40 percent of American families combined.Comments (540)Marty KaplanDirector, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolOn the surface, the fight between the GOP and NBC is about the effects of media on audiences. The party\u0027s presumption -- based on no evidence -- is that the miniseries would put Clinton in a favorable light, and -- also based on no evidence -- that the halo would translate into votes.CommentsLisa BelkinSenior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, The Huffington PostSo how are you feeling about things this morning? About your career? About the response to your grinding declaration of adulthood on the VMAs last night?Comments (227)Charlie NoxDating coachWhile I don\u0027t go searching for men in relationships, I also don\u0027t pretend I feel nothing when it\u0027s not the case. I won\u0027t try to sleep with your boyfriend, and it\u0027s extremely unlikely, but I can\u0027t promise it won\u0027t ever happen.Comments (330)Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOIf you haven\u0027t already done so, I would strongly suggest that you become familiar with the story of Sara Blakely, the founder of Spanx. Not because she is said to be the youngest self-made female billionaire ever, but because she seems to epitomize the combined power of hard work, persistence, innovation and humility.Comments (68)Paul SzepTwo-time Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonistCommentsKia MakarechiEntertainment Editor, The Huffington PostMiley Cyrus put on her best \"look at me, I\u0027m wild\" act at Sunday\u0027s Video Music Awards, performing \"We Can\u0027t Stop\" (her take the syrupy strip club anthems re-popularized as of late by Rihanna, a resurgent Juicy J and a host of other black acts) and fumbling her way through an instantly polarizing smorgasbord of lip-licking, wannabe twerking and (black) ass slapping.Comments (543)Rev. Hugh HollowellPastor and director, Love Wins MinistriesNo representative from the police department was willing to tell us which ordinance we broke, or why, after six years, they are now preventing us from feeding hungry people.Comments (128)Nathan GardelsEditor, NPQ, Global Services of Los Angeles Times Syndicate/Tribune MediaThe indications are certainly in the direction of the use of chemical weapons. However, we all should wait to see the report of the United Nations inspectors before action is taken. The political dynamics are running ahead of due process.CommentsJonathan WeilerDirector of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel HillTo a significant extent, ESPN has always been in la-la land about its ability to do news reporting while it also hocks the products its supposed to be covering evenhandedly. But the NFL concussion story may well prove to be the most serious blow to its self-image yet.Comments (15)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorThe widening circle applauding megamillionaire Larry Summers -- of Harvard University, Washington, D.C. and Wall Street -- agrees on one word to describe the colossal failure -- Brilliant!Comments (27)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarWhat\u0027s different about Cyrus\u0027s performance, which seems to have generated an unprecedented level of outrage, is not its by-now old-hat hypersexuality but its particular seaminess. Cyrus was sexual, de rigueur in pop performances, but also more than a little repelling.Comments (43)Isabel Foxen DukeCertified health coach and emotional eating expert.And after years of studying, I\u0027ve discovered the fundamental mentalities of \"normal\" eaters that are keeping you from freedom with food. Buckle up.Comments (225)Eric H. Holder, Jr.Attorney General of the United StatesAs we gather today, 50 years later, their march -- now our march -- goes on. And our focus has broadened to include the cause of women, of Latinos, of Asian Americans, of lesbians, of gays, of people with disabilities and of countless others across this country who still yearn for equality.Comments (500)Gideon LichfieldGlobal News Editor, QuartzWas the soldier who served a tour of duty in Iraq \"Bradley\" or \"Chelsea\"? And if you wanted to respect her current choice of pronoun, how would you rewrite the sentence \"In Iraq, Manning kept the fact that he was a gay man under wraps\"? (Go on, give it a try.)CommentsTom BarrettMayor of Milwaukee, WIJust as city forefathers took purposeful steps to connect Milwaukee\u0027s first settlements, protect our lakefront, and build world-leading manufacturing companies, so too must our current generation take ownership of our challenges and future.CommentsAmanda ReimanPolicy manager, Drug Policy AllianceThe goal of drug policy is a balance between personal freedom and public safety. It\u0027s a model the public supports, but visualizing what that means in terms of policies and programs can be difficult.CommentsSteve WiensPastor, writer, runnerBy far the best moment every day was when the kids were finally in bed, and the adults all gathered upstairs to laugh, moan about our sore, aging bodies, and relive every precious part of that day.Comments (32)Jeanne Devon (AKMuckraker)Managing Editor, TheMudflats.netIn the never ending edge-of-your-seat ennui that is Sarah Palin\u0027s future political career, there\u0027s some news from the Last Frontier.Comments (243)Raymond J. LearsyAuthor, \u0027Ruminations on the Distortion of Oil Prices and Crony Capitalism\u0027What transpired on Friday was a brutal movement in the price of oil to the enormous benefit to oil interests. And for no reason that can be explained by either an interruption in supply, direct nor indirect, nor significant change in demand, nor economic data supporting the move.Comments (74)Jeff ElderSocial media lead, SF Chronicle, SFGate.com\"No one cares what you had for lunch\" was one of the earliest and stickiest condemnations of social media. Years later and countless photos of food flipped through, social media users by the millions disprove this every day.CommentsAnthony W. OrlandoLecturer in the College of Business and Economics at California State University, Los AngelesThis historical amnesia is a dangerous mistake. It poisons our hearts with pessimism. It blinds us to the lessons and solutions we need. Most New Yorkers have no idea how prevalent poverty used to be -- or how their predecessors made it go away.Comments (260)Jack MirkinsonMedia Editor, The Huffington Post\"Red Team III\" was good! It was a good episode. It really was. Now, of course, in being good, it was also essentially the opposite of every single other episode of the season.Comments (90)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorBecause economics both poses as a hard science and fails to generate reliable predictions, establishing economic facts is an elusive exercise.Comments (339)Sandy WeinerDating Coach at Last First DateResearch has shown that the more compatible you are with your mate, the more successful your relationship will be.Comments (84)Lisa-Jo BakerBlogger at LisaJoBaker.comWhen the car crashes. When you have more long distance charges than you thought possible. When you run out of gas, chocolate chip cookies and faith. I will be there.Comments (24)Seth ShostakSenior Astronomer, SETI InstituteThe \"water found on Mars\" story is as perennial as Christmas. NASA doesn\u0027t need to tell us that again. So why not cut out the seemingly endless stream of robotic middlemen, and just send hardware that will search for life, big or small? Isn\u0027t it time to cut to the chase?Comments (258)Ella Frances SandersIntern, MaptiaAs Friedrich Nietzsche said, \"Words are but symbols for the relations of things to one another and to us; nowhere do they touch upon the absolute truth.\" Here, illustrated, are 11 words whose concepts cannot be properly explained across cultures.Comments (17)Daan Braveman, 2013.26.08Chris Weigant, 2013.26.08Justine Kay, 2013.26.08Michael A.
