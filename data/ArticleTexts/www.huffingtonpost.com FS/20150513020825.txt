{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Author, \u0027Dangerous Ground\u0027There is no defense of Russia\u0027s ongoing actions vis-à-vis Ukraine, or its annexation of the Crimea. But nothing happens in a vacuum, and when it comes to international relations, Newton\u0027s third law of physics applies in full force: for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. George Santayana has famously noted that those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it. But what of those who simply are ignorant of history, especially when it is not their own? America, in particular, seems to be populated by people who, wittingly or not, have taken Francis Fukuyama\u0027s theory of \"the end of history\" to heart. But what sounded plausible at the nexus of American ascendancy over the Soviet Union in the early 1990\u0027s seems laughable today.The difference between understanding oneself as a \"citizen\" and understanding oneself as a \"taxpayer\" is not merely wide; it is antagonistic. A citizen thinks primarily about his or her community. A taxpayer thinks mostly about himself or herself. The Progressive Agenda seeks to return us to the adult responsibility of being citizens to each other.Nobel Prize- and Pulitzer Prize-winning American novelist; Robert F. Goheen Professor of Humanities, Emeritus, Princeton UniversityI strongly believe everything happens for a reason. Had terminal cancer not happened to me, I would not have been able to inspire my closest friends and family to appreciate the beautiful gift of life a little more and live more appreciative and positive lives with my story.#SunsetsForShalinOne of the lasting legacies of the George W. Bush presidency is that it severely lowered the bar on what we expect the president to know. Bush and mainly his primary handler, Karl Rove, made it generally acceptable for the chief executive to be no smarter than the great unwashed he\u0027s governing.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027Republicans are determined to gut Social Security, while Democrats have yet to flatly reject budget cuts or endorse its expansion as part of the party platform. This means that there are two possible futures for Social Security.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourThe TPP gave the United States an opportunity to address the problem of an over-valued dollar, but President Obama chose not to take it. This failure would likely condemn us to many more years of weak labor markets in which workers lack the bargaining power to secure their share of economic growth.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027In the next ten years, we will see the definition of media continuing to take on a new meaning almost every day. In a way, the term \"media\" itself may be endangered as a concept: who is and isn\u0027t a member of the media is harder to understand today than it was when television broadcasters and newspaper publishers were the rulers of the realm.Founder and Partner, Revolution GrowthAs our hearts ache, I can remember that for nine months, he grew within me. My heartbeat was his lullaby. He was safe, and he was already so loved. My body bears the signs and screams out he was here. He was here. He was here.Writer, Scribbles and CrumbsClimate change will emerge as a new driver of migration. As the oceans warm, feeding Atlantic hurricanes with ever-great energy, super storms will become more frequent and more devastating, wracking Central America and the islands of the Caribbean, demolishing homes, businesses, and jobs.Professor at American University in Washington, D.C.You have to be bleeding to death or unconscious to go to the emergency room. When my dad started complaining of chest pain in the middle of the night and said he wanted to go to the ER, my mom warned him that it better not be his gallbladder.Registered nurse behind the blog Adventures of a Labor Nurse: the Highs and Lows of Labor and DeliveryFor more than four years -- ever since his indictment on Espionage Act charges -- the public could not hear the voice of CIA whistleblower Jeffrey Sterling. Until now.Author, \u0027War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death\u0027In perhaps the strongest sign of how far their $15 movement has come, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced a plan to raise pay for fast-food workers statewide, setting up a potentially historic victory that could ripple across the countryPresident, Service Employees International UnionMost people will not see the next tech revolution coming -- it will be largely invisible. Innovation will come from an ecosystem of pervasive computing so natural and all-encompassing that it disappears into the background.President, Microsoft InternationalWhen you become a mother, you want to make the world a better place. Our biggest job as mothers is to teach our children by example, by how we live and what we do. I want to teach my children to always come from a place of love.Actress and recording artistEmmy Award-winning journalistThe death of unarmed Freddie Gray in police custody and the subsequent riots in Baltimore demonstrate the profound systemic injustice in our country, as well as the complete misunderstanding and widespread hypocrisy about nonviolence.Christian peace activist, author of \"The Nonviolent Life,\" JohnDear.org | CampaignNonviolence.orgThere\u0027s a big political fight happening in Washington, but for once it does not break down easily along partisan lines. There are free-traders among both the Democrats and the Republicans, and opposition exists on both sides. But the main skirmish in this fight is currently happening between President Obama and some of his fellow Democrats.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comI went to Kabul, Afghanistan, in March to see old friends. By chance, I arrived the day after a woman had been beaten to death and burned by a mob of young men. The world would soon come to know her name: Farkhunda. The name means \"auspicious\" or \"jubilant.\"Author, \u0027They Were Soldiers: How the Wounded Return From America’s Wars -- The Untold Story\u0027Take away Deflategate, and Tom Brady finds himself in the conversation for greatest quarterback of all time. Of course, if you take away the steroid controversy, Barry Bonds is your unquestioned home run king, and Alex Rodriguez would likely be on his way to catching him.Sports bloggerInstead of focusing entirely on William Weikert, we wanted to learn more about his family, acquaintances, and the Iowa communities where he lived. Finding details about the lives of extended family members and even neighbors can often lead us back to common ancestors shared by different individuals on their separate family trees.Alphonse Fletcher University Professor and Director of the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research at Harvard UniversityVice president of community relations, Ancestry.comThe Internet needs a lot of electricity, and its footprint is only growing as more people around the world get connected. If the Internet is powered by renewable energy, then it can help usher in the clean-energy revolution we so desperately need to avoid catastrophic climate change. This is a major opportunity, and responsibility, for Internet companies to join activists in a crucial fight.Executive Director, Greenpeace USAI have deep concern -- and some dismay -- when the president says that \"we are just wrong,\" or we are \"satisfied with the status quo,\" or worse, we are \"making this stuff up\" when we express concerns about the status of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade negotiations.Sandy Levin is the Ranking Member of the House Ways and Means CommitteeQuantum computers are already here in a limited form, and fully functional versions are on the way. They will be as transformative for mankind as were the mainframe computers, personal computers, and smartphones that we all use. As do all advancing technologies, they will also create new nightmares. The most worrisome development will be in cryptography.Academic, Researcher, Writer, EntrepreneurOne reason Hillary Clinton is a formidable politician is that she\u0027s very smart and very comfortable with ideas. Another reason is an uncanny ability to ignore the past, and its mistakes.Senior Fellow, DemosWe\u0027re living in an age of where the emotional domino effect follows the slogan, \"Do unto others first, before they do unto you.\" Be the bully, lest you be the victim.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarAll the elements that make NBA basketball such a beautiful thing -- the speed, the flow, the rhythm -- were erased for too much of Sunday’s game and replaced by a plodding, groan-worthy affair. It was, it must be said, worse than watching a baseball game.Senior Sports Editor, The Huffington PostYou might want to suggest that your employer look into this. It\u0027s possible, maybe even likely, that your health insurer has been ripping off both you and your employer -- to the tune of several million dollars every year -- for decades.Author, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgBrandon Rittiman and Kyle Clark are political reporters at KUSA-TV, the NBC affiliate in Denver, which says it has \"adopted a \u0027pro-fact\u0027 philosophy.\" I\u0027d love to see them go all pro-fact on Scott Walker, Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush, and on Hilary Clinton too, the way they did with Cory Gardner and Mark Udall in Colorado.USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorI\u0027m the girl that took the picture of the soldier and child in Baltimore that went viral. I meant to capture a sad moment, one of wasted resources and failure. Who knew that so many people think all of our race and economic problems could be solved if someone would just think to smile at a child?Activist and writer, MandaWritesThings.comSHENZHEN -- Today\u0027s cities are not sustainable, no matter how we look at them. Here is an optimistic look at how we can turn challenges into opportunities, and create pulsating future cities.Principle investigator, Future Cities Laboratory, Singapore-ETH CentreNo one who loves me is critical of the decisions I made then. They don\u0027t say to me, \"Anna, I still can\u0027t believe you did that to your unborn child.\" My experience was valid. The person who needs to forgive me is me.Founder/blogger, AnnaSpargoRyan.comInclusion has never expanded my opportunities, or tapped into my creative excellence to solve organizational problems. But engagement has. This is because inclusion is about the company choosing which aspects of me to embrace. When I\u0027m engaged, not only do I excel, the company wins.National Diversity Expert; Principal and Chief Strategist of Criticality Management Consulting; Former Associate Dean of Harvard CollegeGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"TRADE BLOWUP Dems Deal Obama Setback...
