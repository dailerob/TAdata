{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Director, Earth Institute at Columbia University; author, \u0027The Price of Civilization\u0027It\u0027s hard to imagine a less satisfactory jobs report at this stage of President Obama\u0027s term. The economy is dead in the water. Obama has no plan but to wait for the upturn. Mitt Romney\u0027s plan to cut taxes would be disastrously worse, plunging us into a deep financial and social crisis. It\u0027s long past time to face basic facts. America\u0027s economic problems are structural and will not be solved by more tax cuts, quantitative easing, or short-term stimulus. Neither party offers real solutions, though the Republicans\u0027 policies would drive us much faster to ruin. Real solutions require fresh strategies to break free of vested interests in energy, healthcare, education, and infrastructure. In other words, in today\u0027s political environment, real solutions won\u0027t happen any time soon. We are stuck.Read Post | Comments (191)Mohamed A. El-Erian, 09/07/12CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOAs hard as Ben Bernanke and his Fed colleagues try -- and they have been trying very hard, taking monetary policy ever deeper into unfamiliar/experimental territory -- the institution does not have the proper tools to deal with our unemployment crisis.Read Post | Comments (825)Rev. Otis Moss III, 09/08/12Senior Pastor of Trinity United Church of Christ, Christian Activist and Cultural CriticIn this day of the viral \"empty chair,\" the church community and the interfaith community must speak to the \"empty chair\" and what it represents -- the invisible racism and voter suppression in America.Read Post | Comments (243)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 09/08/12Author, research psychologist, and gender scholarMallory was nearing 30 when her 60-something father got divorced from her mother and started dating younger women. As in much younger women--none more than a few years older than Mallory, and some even younger. Naturally, a few issues came up.Read Post | Comments (82)Amb. Marc Ginsberg, 09/07/12Former U.S. Ambassador to MoroccoWhat is striking about Kerry\u0027s stewardship in the past two years is the comradeship he has forged with foreign dignitaries and with Republican committee members to create a small, effective bastion of bipartisan cooperation on matters essential to the nation\u0027s national security.Read Post | Comments (80)Marian Wright Edelman, 09/07/12President, Children\u0027s Defense FundEvery 29 seconds, a child is born into poverty in America. Every 29 seconds. One hundred and twenty-four children every hour. Children like 10-year-old Tyler, five-year-old Keiris, and four-year-old Jerimiah, who live with their mother, Christina Wyatt, 24, in Middletown, Ohio.Read Post | Comments (136)Chris Kluwe, 09/07/12NFL player, Minnesota VikingsI find it inconceivable that you are an elected official of the United States government. Your vitriolic hatred and bigotry make me ashamed and disgusted to think that you are in any way responsible for shaping policy at any level.Read Post | Comments (1,339)Eric Kester, 09/07/12AuthorWhen a few students cheat on a test, it\u0027s easy to dismiss the problem as one of individual folly. But when 125 -- one hundred and twenty five -- students coordinate to commit academia\u0027s cardinal sin, well, that speaks to a vastly larger issue, an issue of a flawed culture.Read Post | Comments (87)Charles J. Reid, Jr., 09/07/12Professor of Law, University of St. ThomasRepublicans have made much about the word \"God\" in the Democratic platform. Like the Pharisees, they stand ostentatiously in the front of the synagogue, congratulating themselves on their righteousness. But I have looked, and I cannot find God in the GOP platform.Read Post | Comments (419)Cristen Conger, 09/07/12Co-host, Stuff Mom Never Told You podcast and staff writer, HowStuffWorks.com.When the Internet told me that Amy Poehler and Will Arnett are splitting after nine years of marriage, I audibly gasped.Read Post | Comments (27)Janet Harris, 09/07/12News analyst and president, Upstream AnalysisTwo weeks of Republican and Democratic conventioneering concluded last night with President Obama\u0027s speech accepting the nomination of his party. Whether one considered his speech brilliant oratory or just a good effort, in many ways it was typical of speeches given by incumbent presidents.Read Post | Comments (30)Michael Moore, 09/07/12Oscar and Emmy-winning directorDon\u0027t sit it out. Don\u0027t try to convince anyone Obama has magically transformed us - just tell them four years is simply not enough time to undo all the hurt caused by biggest economic crash since the Great Depression and the biggest military blunder/lie in our history.Read Post | Comments (1,164)Linda Bergthold, 09/07/12Health policy consultantThe Democrats are the only ones who have a specific plan to improve quality in health care, access to affordable coverage, and ultimately a way to control costs.
