{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Today, the march for civil rights isn\u0027t about convincing Americans that racism is wrong. It is about getting money out of politics, so that the profit from institutional racism is eliminated. The Supreme Court\u0027s decision in Plessy vs. Ferguson saying \"separate but equal\" has been trumped by the Supreme Court\u0027s Citizens United decision, eliminating all restrictions on corporate cash in politics.

This is a great victory for the vast majority of the country, the 99 percent, over the One Percent.Read Post | CommentsSteven Van Zandt, 1/16/12Record producer, songwriter, and musicianIf we were to indulge in the \"best\" thing, we would have to attach the characteristic of \"important\" to \"best\" to help justify the value judgment.
