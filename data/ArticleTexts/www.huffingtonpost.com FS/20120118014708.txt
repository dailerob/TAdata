{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"On Wednesday, I\u0027ll be speaking at the winter meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors in Washington. The juxtaposition between our national leaders and our local leaders has never been more stark. On a national level, we\u0027re paralyzed and polarized -- and the chance, at least for the foreseeable future, that any innovative thinking or meaningful change will be coming out of Washington seems laughable. That\u0027s why I believe the solutions the country is so desperately looking for are going to come at the local level -- from our mayors and engaged citizens working with their communities. It\u0027s our cities, not the nation\u0027s capital, that are the real idea factory of our country.
