{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupIt’s easy enough to be cynical about what the Democrats were up to in this report. They wanted to heap retrospective blame on Bush and his cronies. Yet at least some top Democrats knew -- or had reason to know -- that their own cry for blood and retribution after 9/11 would lead where it did. The Democrats wanted to insulate themselves, and by extension, President Barack Obama. The president may not authorize torture, but he nevertheless is raining down drones in Afghanistan -- drones that kill supposed terrorists and innocent civilians alike. Bush defenders and the Central Intelligence Agency race to defend themselves, and call Democrats complicit. But supporters of the program not only let things get horribly out of hand, they also covered up efforts to find out the truth of what they did.For the CIA officials involved in torture, one thing was clear from the very beginning: The only way they would be forgiven for what they did was if they could show it had saved lives. It was the heart of their rationale. It was vital to public acceptance. It was how they would avoid prosecution.Senior Writer, The InterceptA half-century later, my father\u0027s words are still powerful, still relevant. Justice, racial equality, and the Beloved Community that he often described are still, to paraphrase Victor Hugo, ideas whose time has come. In fact, their time is long overdue.Chief Executive Officer, The King CenterThere has been a suggestion in recent days that now is not a good time to release a review prepared by the Senate Intelligence Committee of the CIA\u0027s detention and interrogation program. But is there ever a good time to admit our country tortured people?U.S. Senator from CaliforniaThe Bush-Cheney torture techniques were never meant to elicit reliable intelligence--they were meant to torture. I know, because they were used on me.J.D. candidate, University of Washington School of Law; Lieutenant Commander, U.S. Navy ReserveI have forgotten most of them, and so has the public. However, I am proud of the ones I will tell you about. A few are sentimental favorites that mark meaningful times in my off-screen life and milestones in my rise to stardom. Others are meaningful to me because they also gave insight into serious issues.Actor, author of 10 books and a book of poems \"Life Could Be Verse” to be published by HCI, December 2014If traditional capital punishment has declined, another kind of capital punishment continues unabated. This other form of capital punishment, far more common than the traditional kind, involves the killing of Americans by the police without benefit of charges, trial, jury, or the right to appeal.Professor of sociology, University of California at BerkeleyIn the absence of greater agitation, limitation and oversight, the national security establishment is likely to get worse, not better, in terms of its accountability to democratic control and the rule of law.Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicyNelson Mandela, who founded The Elders in 2007, believed transformative leaders needed the generosity and courage to see beyond narrow self-interest.

They are emblematic of a looming water crisis that will directly impact us all.ActorU.S. Representative from OregonThe outpouring of anger that we\u0027ve seen on college campuses and in the streets of the U.S. is a reason for hopefulness that when the media turns its attention away from this issue some of the consciousness about racism will remain alive beyond the peoples of color who can never forget it.Editor, Tikkun MagazineFew of the \"emerging\" rights have yet garnered sufficient consensus to be considered established universal rights. But what the political nature of human rights does point to is this: each one of us has a role to play in shaping the human rights of the future.President and CEO, Unitarian Universalist Service CommitteeThe Yorkville garbage processing factory scandal reveals just about everything that\u0027s wrong with government and a lot that\u0027s wrong with journalism. How local reporters have managed to get this story so wrong and miss so much is a mystery.Writer/director, \u0027The Ledge\u0027; Author, Trials of the Monkey\u0027; President, ScienceDebate.orgHere, at Guantanamo, I am never heard. I am only ignored. In 13 years of imprisonment without charge, I\u0027ve never been able to tell anyone who I really am. I am not ISN 026. That is the government\u0027s number. My name is Fahd Abdullah Ahmed Ghazy. I am a human being -- a man -- who is loved and who loves.Detainee, Guantánamo BayHere is a list of brands I think are making great products for kids, women and men. I encourage you to consider them as you continue your hunt for the perfect gift! Here are a few of my favorite things...Dear son: It hurts my heart to tell you this. The fact is, some people in this country will first and foremost only see your chocolate skin. And they will judge you for it. They won\u0027t want to hear what you have to say. All that will matter to them is your skin tone.Award-winning writer, copywriter, entrepreneurA new leak of confidential documents expands the list of big companies seeking secret tax deals in Luxembourg, exposing tax-saving maneuvers by American entertainment icon The Walt Disney Co., politically controversial Koch Industries Inc. and 33 other companies.The International Consortium of Investigative JournalistsWe tried to sound the alarm about what harm torture could bring. The Bush administration didn\u0027t listen. Had they, we simply wouldn\u0027t be here today. If there is any positive to come out of the release of this report, and turmoil that may come as a result of facts being released, let it be, finally, a wake-up call.Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranThe Libyan revolution triumphed in autumn 2011 with the aid of several friendly countries, foremost among them France and the United States. At last, the future seemed open: fraternity, liberty, and prosperity would reign; we were united. Three years after our liberation, my heart bleeds.BusinessmanEmploying this many workers may make the company seem virtuous and altruistic, but the business model is not a model other companies should emulate.Communications Director, Brave New FoundationToday, retirement is something that fairy tales are made of.

You simply were never part of the plan. Growing up and dreaming of my family I never included you. I didn\u0027t want help from another woman to raise my child. But then you arrived. Dang your kind smile! I was planing on really hating you. I wanted to resent you but you made it impossible.Founder, Women With WorthThe debate over whether the CIA did or did not mislead the Bush administration is a red herring.
