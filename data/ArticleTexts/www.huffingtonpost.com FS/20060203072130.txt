{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"From pbs.orgFrom news.bbc.co.ukAP/NY TImes/Jim EstrinThere is nothing more infuriating than hearing something you passionately believe in -- and indeed have been advocating for years -- cynically co-opted by someone who clearly doesn\u0027t mean it. That\u0027s why the smoke started pouring out of my ears Tuesday night when President Bush announced: \"America is addicted to oil, which is often imported from unstable parts of the world.\" I also wondered if the Detroit Project, which I co-founded three years ago, should ask the White House for a royalty check. Here are two of the TV ads we produced urging American consumers to connect the dots between the cars we drive, our addiction to oil, and our national security...READ POST | comments (33)02.02.2006 David CornThis is a rather big deal. The president of the United States caught conspiring to create a modern-day version of the sinking of the Maine? Talk about an impeachable offense.READ POST | comments (17)02.02.2006 David FidererIs Porter Goss saying that, before the New York Times story, the terrorists and their friends had no idea the U.S. government wiretaps people?

It hardly seems too much to ask that the 15 people responsible for global peace and security meet to discuss the subject each morning.READ POST | comments02.02.2006 Howard A. RodmanPresident Bush said today that the reason he invented events that never happened and embellished his account of his life in his widely-viewed talk, \"A State of the Union Speech,\" is because it made a better talk.READ POST | comments02.02.2006 Deanne StillmanThe ban on the slaughter of wild horses is scheduled to begin in March and expire eight months later.

And unless we have the guts to force conservatives to defend their out-of-the-mainstream views on taxes, we will forever be fighting battles on Big Money\u0027s tilted playing field.READ POST | comments (15)02.02.2006 Eric AltermanA day after Bush got done telling the country what a brave, noble and generous people we are, the Republican Congress votes to stick it to the poor, the old, the indigent and the most vulnerable.READ POST | comments02.02.2006 Sam HarrisI recently spent a week with one hundred fellow scientists at a retreat devoted to the study of the human mind.
