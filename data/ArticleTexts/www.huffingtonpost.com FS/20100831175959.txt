{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"As a senator, Barack Obama spoke eloquently of Americans deciding that \"their work, their possessions, their diversions, their sheer busyness, is not enough.\" But the hunger for a larger purpose in public life remains unfulfilled. And the big turnout at Glenn Beck\u0027s rally on the anniversary of Martin Luther King\u0027s \"I Have a Dream\" speech is more evidence of this unmet yearning. Beck delivered a speech noticeably devoid of partisan rhetoric -- talking instead about values and morals and God and the power of individuals to change the world. In 2006, Obama warned that if progressives didn\u0027t \"reach out to evangelical Christians and other religious Americans and tell them what we stand for,\" others would \"fill the vacuum.\" In 2010, the president\u0027s stepping back from his promise to call us to a higher form of civic engagement means that a vacuum has been left during this historic moment of transition in America.Read Post | CommentsDrew Westen, 08.31.2010Psychologist and neuroscientist; Emory University ProfessorRepublicans are running Tea Party candidates who are so far to the right you can\u0027t see Middle America from their porch.
