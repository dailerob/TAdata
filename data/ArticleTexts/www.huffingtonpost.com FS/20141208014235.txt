{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, the nation experienced yet another collective shock as a Staten Island grand jury declined to indict an NYPD officer in the chokehold death of Eric Garner. As Chris Rock tweeted, \"This one was on film\" -- a nod to the grand jury in Ferguson declining to indict Darren Wilson in the shooting death of Michael Brown just a week earlier. And on Thursday, the Justice Department released a damning report about a seemingly out-of-control police force in Cleveland (where a police officer recently killed Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old holding a pellet gun). In response to all this, largely peaceful protests have broken out across America. The question isn\u0027t just how to police our police. The problem is how to fix a broken justice system that has, for obvious reasons, lost the trust of much of our country. The first step is translating people\u0027s anger into political action to reassert accountability and put justice back into the justice system. #BlackLivesMatterI didn\u0027t cry. But a part of me died. When I heard the news about Eric Garner, my casual \"faith\" in America died -- and I am thankful for its death.Executive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostWe cannot allow Eric Garner\u0027s sadly prophetic next words, \"It stops today,\" to refer only to his life. It is past time that we admit what so many have known for too long: that all too often, our justice system simply is not just.Director, ACLU National Office\u0027s Racial Justice ProgramMaybe death, pleasure, security, and risk are the products of this region. The risk: One day driving down the Strip about a decade ago, I realized that every hotel tower, every fountain, and every chandelier was largely paid for by losing bets. I understood for the first time what gambling really means.Author, \u0027Men Explain Things to Me\u0027If local police are going to receive military weapons at all, the federal government has an obligation to put some reasonable constraints on how they are able to use them.Senior counsel, Center for Justice, ACLUIt\u0027s past time to fix it, and the church must stand alongside a new generation of young leaders and help the nation find the way forward.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersWith the same predictability and inevitability of a House vote to abolish Obamacare, Bill O\u0027Reilly yet again has declared his false war on the faux war on Christmas.Scientist and former White House Senior Policy Analyst; Ph.D. in marine biology/neurophysiologyChange is undeniably hard. Progress is not an exercise in expediency. But if you are committed, then you will understand that you have no choice but to keep going not to see if you will win but until you win.President, National Action NetworkI was in Bhopal, India, 10 years after the 1984 disaster in which a now-infamous Union Carbide pesticide plant released 27 tons of a toxic chemical into a crowded, sleeping city, killing 8,000 people immediately and over 20,000 to date.Executive Director, Greenpeace USAEducation -- the backbone of these countries\u0027 futures -- is not immune to Ebola\u0027s insidious reach.Actress and Concern Worldwide Global AmbassadorIf the term \"apartheid\" shames the establishment into acting -- and prompts pundits to utter the word \"race\" when discussing inequality -- then by all means let\u0027s use the unflattering comparison. It\u0027s a fitting way of bearing witness to the life and times of Michael B. and everyone else who has suffered under this abhorrent system.Director, Foreign Policy In FocusThe long-term deterioration of the middle class, accelerated by the Wall Street crash of 2008, has not been pretty. Today, we have more wealth and income inequality than any major country on Earth.Independent U.S. Senator from VermontOne year ago, a sexual assault survivor in the U.S. military faced a daunting landscape. The president gave military leaders one year to implement the defense bill and show significant progress. And so this week, those military leaders will give their report to the president.U.S. Senator from MissouriOur nation is cracking wide open on the fault line of race. In order to repair what is broken, we need each other. We need to heal, to connect, and to be the change.Senior Minister, Middle Collegiate ChurchEnriching the informational base of democracy and making greater use of interactive public reasoning can contribute significantly to making democracy more workable, and also allow reasoned assessment of social welfare.Nobel Laureate Economic SciencesThe emergence of this deadly, mysterious disease tested us like never before. In many ways, we as a society failed that test.Governor of New YorkThere are so many crises that when we turn our attention to working to bring one of these under control -- or trying to reduce the suffering that a particular crisis is causing -- two more pop up. At a different time in our history, we may have felt tempted to ignore some of these threats.U.S. Ambassador to the United NationsThe World Health Organization reported a global total of more than 16,000 cases and nearly 6,943 deaths. We also expect economic losses in the billions of dollars in the West Africa region, as employees stay home, markets close, and food prices rise. At the same time, we are seeing some hopeful signs.President, World Bank GroupOne can only hope that Ashton Carter has moved past his glib endorsements of Donald Rumsfeld\u0027s disingenuous \"group think\" and Neil McElroy\u0027s outright distortion of the truth and on to a personal code of conduct where speaking truth to power is seen not as a vice but as a virtue.Author, \u0027Dangerous Ground\u0027On this Giving Tuesday, where charity is a priority for all of us who have shelter, health and peace, we all must act on behalf of the 51 million.ActorI took this trip because of a perpetual heartache I felt, a lack of connectivity with myself and with the world. I needed to step out of my comfort zone and decided to do that halfway across the world. And there is where I found a tribe of individuals who felt exactly the same way.Blog Editor, The Huffington PostFor all the debate about the specifics of each case and the need for body cameras, reformed grand jury procedures, training, diverse police forces and the like, the Garner case brings another critical macro issue to the surface about the intensity of policing in a time of low crime rates.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityThe weight loss journey begins -- and much of the battle is won -- when you believe you deserve that end game and can see the finish line with clarity. Can you envision what life will be like when your clothes finally fit comfortably? How will it feel when you chase after the kids in the park without getting breathless?Author, Host \"Dr. Phil\"The review of CIA interrogation methods during George W. Bush\u0027s presidency has been the subject of a contentious back-and-forth, with U.S. intelligence agencies and the White House on one side pushing for mass redactions in the name of national security, and committee staffers on the other arguing that the proposed redactions render the report unintelligible.Senior Writer, The InterceptThe surest way to avoid ever having your most private photos shared publicly is to not take them in the first place. This is the philosophy behind the most common advice given to teens, among whom the rates of \"sexting\" continue to rise. Trust no one. Share nothing. Even better: Take nothing. It\u0027s ridiculous logic.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarThe lawyer\u0027s work and that of the detective\u0027s long hours is how many mysteries have been solved -- or not. And then DNA entered criminology to add to the writer\u0027s magical box of solutions. Here is an example in my own case.Author and Historian; author of the acclaimed Anjou Trilogy and frequent lecturer and historical writer.It\u0027s curious that four crucial aspects of war, American-style, were missing from the blitz of Hagel reportage. Here\u0027s a rundown.Editor, TomDispatch.comSomething changes when your parents get divorced, when you console your friends after devastating breakups, when an argument changes the course of a relationship and no matter how many apologies happen, it\u0027s still heading due South.Associate Editor, Blogs \u0026 CommunityDiscovering an ancestor\u0027s elusive Irish birthplace is a big deal for genealogists.

How could anyone ever tell you otherwise?Writer, comedian, mom. http://girlonsaturday.blogspot.comI looked over at my daughter and wondered where she got her hearty constitution. If someone gave me a doll-man and told me it would watch my every move and then astrally project itself at night, I\u0027d have chronic diarrhea and never sleep again.Writer, editor, and radio host; blogger, mommyklatch.blogspot.comGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"TRUTH: U.S. RACISM \u0027DEEPLY ROOTED\u0027",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
