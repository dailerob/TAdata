{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, Greece fended off a looming exit from the eurozone with its election of New Democracy\u0027s Antonis Samaras -- but couldn\u0027t fend off political nemesis Germany on the soccer field, falling 4-2 in the European Cup quarterfinals. In the U.S., the Obama campaign released a new video attacking Mitt Romney\u0027s record of shipping American jobs overseas -- both as governor and as a \"corporate buyout specialist.\" Meanwhile, Bloomberg News reported that Romney had asked Florida\u0027s Republican governor to stop touting his state\u0027s good economic news because it clashed with the GOP candidate\u0027s message that Obama is destroying the economy. And there are still 135 more days until the election -- a long, hot run-up that promises to be increasingly ugly.

Now it\u0027s simply about how 50-something-year-old women are to behave.
