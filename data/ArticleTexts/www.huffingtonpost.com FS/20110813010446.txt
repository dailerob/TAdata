{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"The Ames Straw Poll serves a heroic purpose in our American lives. It gives the media something to fixate on in the critical month of August, when there is \"nothing to write about\" because all the powerful men and women have left Washington. As for the candidates, whoever takes the top spot in the poll will win one Complete News Cycle, and enjoy prominent placement in the political newshole until something else shiny happens, unless that winner is Ron Paul, in which case the media will quickly downplay its importance. The loser of the Ames Straw Poll will probably also enjoy prominent placement in the political newshole. So, in reality, nobody should have anything on the line, here.Read Post | CommentsMohamed el-Erian, 8/12/11CEO and co-CIO, Pacific Investment Management CompanyIf policymakers in America and Europe do not act boldly, and do so in a globally-coordinated fashion, the world risks tipping into a prolonged recession with worrisome institutional, political and social consequences.Read Post | CommentsReza Aslan, 8/12/11Founder, AslanMedia.com; Author, \u0027Beyond Fundamentalism\u0027By focusing on a wider range of domestic threats beyond just \"radical Islam,\" and by moving more government resources toward preventive measures, the Obama White House is being neither politically correct nor weak on terrorism.

This lack of representation on the debt ceiling Super Committee which is charged with cutting $1.5 trillion from the federal budget is pathetic.Read Post | CommentsAndy Ostroy, 8/12/11Political \u0026 pop culture analystGood news for Obama. He officially won Thursday night\u0027s Republican debate and he didn\u0027t even have to show up. Despite all the criticism coming at him from all sides, not one GOP hopeful was able to present him or herself as a viable alternative for 2012.Read Post | CommentsAlec Baldwin, 8/11/11ActorAm I running for mayor?

In the following interview, she reflects on the current state of women and politics, and her own vision for the future of feminism.Read Post | CommentsMarian Wright Edelman, 8/12/11President, Children\u0027s Defense FundStaying in school and receiving a quality education are the best deterrents to juvenile delinquency. Yet almost half of our states spend on average more than three times as much per prisoner as per public school pupil.Read Post | CommentsTherese Borchard, 8/11/11Author of the blog Beyond Blue on Beliefnet.comI know a woman who recently asked her husband to either give her his Facebook password or close out his account after she found an email that he had sent to a former classmate that she found to be rather suggestive. He thought it was perfectly appropriate. Who\u0027s right?Read Post | CommentsRebecca Carroll, 8/12/11Features Editor, HuffPost Black VoicesI felt angry, not because the behavior of those kids wasn\u0027t completely ill-mannered, but because if they had been three white boys dressed in J. Crew blazers, this man probably wouldn\u0027t be talking to the cops about it.Read Post | CommentsArianna Huffington, 8/11/11These are really challenging times for millions of Latinos. But as an immigrant to this country I know that the immigrant spirit and resilience that are at the heart of the American experience can help us all overcome whatever obstacles lie ahead and truly move mountains.Read Post | CommentsRichard (RJ) Eskow, 8/12/11Consultant, Writer, Senior Fellow with The Campaign for America\u0027s FutureThere\u0027s a reason why the Super Committee was designed to bypass normal democratic processes. The public hates what it\u0027s trying to do. And so do policy experts who understand how destructive their cuts would be to an already-wounded economy.Read Post | CommentsTom Gregory, 8/12/11Actor, radio personality, Tony-nominated producer, and tastemakerArt, like language, morphs words and tones to describe the world. It can be a reflective, interpretive, literal, and/or emotional. Important art passes the litmus test of time. It remains in the pop culture lingo to mark the space from whence it came.Read Post | CommentsScott Mendelson, 8/12/11Film CriticBert and Ernie are just friends. I know that because the producers of Sesame Street told me so. Does the gay rights movement really want to be seen as forcing two men to get married irrespective of their actual say in the matter?Read Post | CommentsMatt J. Rossano, 8/12/11Professor of Psychology, Southeastern Louisiana UniversityI don\u0027t pay much attention to creationism for the same reason that I don\u0027t watch much television -- it\u0027s boring. Real science is far more interesting than an amateurish knockoff.Read Post | CommentsAdam Hamilton, 8/12/11Author, \u0027Making Sense of God\u0027s Will\u0027This year, change.org had a petition drive to protest Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz\u0027 plans to speak on leadership at Willow Creek, which was described as having a \"long history of anti-gay persecution.\"Read Post | CommentsPaul Iorio, 8/12/11Freelance writer/reporterYou\u0027re in downtown San Francisco, having just finished, say, a business trip.
