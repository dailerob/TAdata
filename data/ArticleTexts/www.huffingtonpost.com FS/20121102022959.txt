{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Just about a year ago, I visited OWN studios in Los Angeles for a TV/web simulcast of Oprah\u0027s Lifeclass. As I watched Oprah effortlessly integrate her live audience with those joining online and via social media, I was struck by the realization that even though she\u0027d been a dominant player on television for more than two decades, Oprah was, in fact, made for the Internet. She was about engagement and authenticity and connection long before the web discovered them. And since engagement is deeply embedded in the DNA of HuffPost as well, I\u0027m delighted that we\u0027re partnering with the Oprah Winfrey Network to bring some of Oprah\u0027s best content to the HuffPost platform. So welcome to HuffPost OWN, where we\u0027ll focus on self-empowerment, healthy living for the mind and body, relationships, and deepening the conversation on, as Oprah puts it, living our best lives.Read Post | Comments (20)Oprah Winfrey, 11/01/12Chairman and CEO, Oprah Winfrey NetworkUnderstanding that we are all more powerful than we know -- that we are all connected to something bigger than ourselves -- is the real conversation I want to have in the new OWN section on HuffPost. In many ways, it is the only conversation, I believe, truly worth having.Read Post | Comments (199)Bob Cesca, 11/01/12Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez Show, Media ProducerDuring the Bush years, the Republicans used to say it was unpatriotic to criticize the commander-in-chief when troops were in harm\u0027s way -- that it would endanger the lives of our soldiers and damage morale. But this deeply heart-felt declaration of wartime patriotism has now been completely abandoned.Read Post | Comments (291)Jared Bernstein, 11/01/12Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorWhat\u0027s particularly ridiculous about Romney\u0027s swiftboating is that he is criticizing Chrysler\u0027s global expansion. Since when do conservatives object to that? Is there anyone who believes for a nanosecond that expansion abroad by U.S. multinational\u0027s would be viewed critically by a Romney administration?Read Post | Comments (497)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 11/01/12Author, research psychologist, and gender scholarTalking to kids about politics helps them understand the world and their place in it, and starts to shift their thinking from \"me\" to \"we.\" Which is why it\u0027s important to discuss with kids, even those too young to yet understand all the specific policy points or platforms, why politics matters.Read Post | CommentsRobert L. Borosage, 11/01/12President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureStep back from the partisan posturing and political rhetoric for a moment. Ask yourself a simple question. What is the agenda of the richest Americans? What would they want to consolidate their position? In every case, Romney takes up their cause.Read Post | Comments (141)Oliver Stone and Peter Kuznick, 11/01/12It is time for a national conversation about what this country\u0027s history has really been -- good and bad, warts and all.Read Post | Comments (55)Eleanor Smeal, 11/01/12President of The Feminist MajorityDon\u0027t be fooled that the gender gap -- the measurable difference in the way women and men vote for candidates and in the way they view political issues -- is disappearing. To the contrary, it is driving the 2012 election.Read Post | CommentsChristopher Hennessy, 10/30/12Poet and author, \u0027Love-in-Idleness\u0027 and \u0027Outside the Lines: Talking with Contemporary Gay Poets\u0027We have a week left. Share your feelings with those who love you, and ask that they do the right thing. Tell them that the future they think Romney will give them comes at a cost, sadly. And it might not be their friends but their very children who ask for their money back.Read Post | Comments (777)Sen. Barbara Boxer, 10/31/12U.S. Senator from California; Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public WorksHurricane Sandy reminds us of a basic truth: Disaster relief and preparedness matter. In times of great crisis, it is critical that we have a strong national response to help provide a lifeline to affected states.Read Post | Comments (163)Lucas Kavner, 11/01/12Culture Reporter, Huffington PostWe\u0027ve already seen a number of true heroes emerge in the aftermath of this hurricane. But lucky for us, one man has come bursting out of the rubble of the storm like some feather-haired phoenix, ready to spread bile and ill-will via his Twitter account.Read Post | Comments (53)Paul Gordon, 11/01/12MFA studentA flood\u0027s an auspicious and devastating way of \"cleaning house,\" yet we never know from where the next large-scale change in our lives will come. Though it surely will. Mother Nature\u0027s forces are so great, and as far as she\u0027s concerned, the notion of what is fair for us doesn\u0027t figure in.Read Post | CommentsTom Angell, 10/30/12Founder and Chairman, Marijuana MajorityThree legalization initiatives on state ballots are drawing support from voters, newspapers, civic groups, celebrities and even some members of law enforcement. But guess who else is speaking out in support of changing marijuana laws?Read Post | Comments (251)Naomi Wolf, 11/01/12Bestselling author, \u0027The End of America: Letter of Warning to a Young Patriot\u0027I keep learning more eye-opening information about my fellow human beings as I travel around the country talking about Vagina: A New Biography. The adventures continue.Read Post | CommentsRichard Schiff, 11/01/12Actor, Screen Actor’s Guild MemberI shudder to think what will happen if this president does not retain the lease to our Oval Office.

(Witness Hurrican Sandy and its lost lives and tens of billions of dollars in wreckage.) It\u0027s high time that candiates for the presidency and Congress participate in a debate dedicated to these topics.Read Post | CommentsStephanie Guico, 11/01/12Masters Student in Co-operative and Credit Union ManagementBeginning a business may be a small part of a much larger dream to build a better world, but it is a necessary step and the beginning of a transformation which will see people build stable lives for themselves and their loved ones.Read Post | CommentsTamara Mann, 11/01/12Ph.D. candidate, Columbia UniversityOn June 19, the state of Ohio declared that I had a voluntary abortion. My rabbi and my doctors disagreed. I simply wanted to be pregnant.Read Post | Comments (256)Richard (RJ) Eskow, 11/01/12Writer; host, \u0027The Breakdown\u0027; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureIt\u0027s a sign of our shadowy times that the latest regulatory \"reform\" bill hasn\u0027t been laughed out of Washington. Same goes for the latest bankers\u0027 complaint, this time about being asked to cover their own bets.Read Post | CommentsMike Ragogna, 11/01/12Radio Personality on Solar Powered KRUU-FM, Music Biz VetHere\u0027s a brand new song that Sheryl Crow just wrote in light of the current political atmosphere. This is the first time anyone has heard the new track, and she\u0027s also offering a free download.Read Post | CommentsDavid Halperin, 11/01/12Attorney, advocate, writer at RepublicReport.orgAs the truth catches up with the major for-profit colleges, it appears these companies are doubling down on a Mitt Romney victory as their last best hope to retain unquestioned access to a torrent of taxpayer money.Read Post | Comments (18)Scott Lilly, 11/01/12Senior fellow, Center for American ProgressWhen Colin Powell or other military leaders look at the Romney campaign and find that more than a third of the national security advisors come from a single conservative think tank, maybe they fear a disastrous replay of the past decade.Read Post | Comments (11)Pamela Dussault, 11/01/12Spiritual teacher, mentor, counselor, author, soul mate relationship specialist, founder of R.E.A.P.

That the Republican ticket would end Medicare as we know it, turning it into a costly and confusing voucher program.Read Post | Comments (229)Lincoln Mitchell, 11/01/12Harriman Institute, Columbia UniversityUnwillingness to criticize the federal government for taking on these tasks might be read as sensitivity at a difficult time, but it also demonstrates that Republican ideas about drastically reducing government are so extreme that they themselves don\u0027t take them seriously.Read Post | Comments (16)Elliott Negin, 11/01/12Director of News \u0026 Commentary, Union of Concerned ScientistsMaligning Al Gore for making shrewd investments is silly. But trying to poison public opinion about the need to promote clean energy alternatives with what we know about climate change?
