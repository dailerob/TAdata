{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AriannaIf you haven’t read Jay Rosen’s brilliant take on the Downing Street Memo coverage, do yourself a favor and do it before the day is out. Rosen\u0027s theory is that blogs have become the news cycle\u0027s appeals court, and that the Downing Street Memo story is still alive because it won on appeal. And thank God.If you were to get your news only from television, you’d think the top issue facing our country right now is an 18-year-old girl named Natalee who went missing in Aruba. Every time one of these stories comes up, like, say, Michael Jackson, when it’s finally over I think, what a relief, now we can get back to real news. But we never do. When one of these big league nonstories ends, they just call up a new one from the minors... and off they go with another round of breathless reporting. Anything to not have to actually report actual news.When defending these choices, news execs inevitably fall back on the old \"we’re just giving the people what they want.\" But are they? Fox News averages around two and a quarter million viewers in primetime; CNN hovers just under a million; MSNBC pulls in a quarter million. We have 280 million people in the country. That means that tens of millions of people actually don’t want what they’re being given -- and that there are huge slices of audience a real news operation could go after.Read More06.20.2005 Laurie DavidThe latest environmental atrocity is a scientific analysis of the impact of cattle grazing on public lands that has been falsified -- leading to a relaxation of grazing rules. The study -- paid for with taxpayer dollars -- originally said that the new grazing rules would have “a significant adverse impact” on wildlife. Enter an as-yet-unidentified Dept. of Interior re-write man and -- presto! -- the report suddenly said that the new rules would be “beneficial to animals”. I don’t have my thesaurus handy, but I’m pretty sure “adverse” and “beneficial” are not synonyms.read whole post | permalink | comments06.20.2005 Jay RosenWhat journalists call news judgment used to be king. If the press ruled against you, you just weren\u0027t news. But if you weren\u0027t news how would anyone know enough about you (or care) to contest the ruling? That\u0027s what having singular influence was all about. The way it works today, the World Wide Web is the sovereign force, and journalists live and work according to its rules. Now if there\u0027s something newsworthy coming out of the U.K. but neglected in America the political blogs in America and other activists online keep talking about it. Quickly the story\u0027s unjust obscurity will reach a political player who can change that by acting in a newsworthy way, lending fresh facts and additional reason to cover the story.read whole post | permalink | comments06.20.2005 Danielle Crittenden“The execs are completely divorced from reality” critics warn as box office war enters 17th week of quagmire Los Angeles [AP] – Hollywood continued to be pounded by poor box office receipts for the seventeenth week in a row. Despite hundreds of millions spent by studios so far, recent bombs such as “The Perfect Man” and “The Honeymooners” have shaken executives’ optimism about the outcome of the war for summertime entertainment dollars. Experts agree that even the strong offensive launched this weekend by “Batman Begins,” will not be enough to reverse the tide or restore confidence in the studio administrations’ war plans. In fact, new polls show that a growing number of Americans favor a withdrawal from theaters to other forms of entertainment.read whole post | permalink | comments06.20.2005 Cenk UygurAre the people in the mainstream media this dumb or are they complicit? All weekend long, all you could hear on the Sunday morning talk shows and on the “news” was whether Dick Durbin should be punished for what he said about Guantanamo Bay. I simply cannot believe that we are talking about what the Senator said about Gitmo instead of what happened at Gitmo. The appropriate question that the media should be hammering away at is, “Did the administration sanction the abuses at Guantanamo? And who should be held responsible for those abuses?”read whole post | permalink | comments06.19.2005 Walter ShapiroThere is a kabuki quality to the histrionics over Bolton. Soon Congress, exhausted from its sound-bite skirmishing, will rush home for a holiday break, since patriotic tradition decrees that you cannot have a Fourth of July parade without a blowhard congressman on the premises. As soon as the Senate leaves town, George W. Bush presumably will appoint Bolton to the UN slot as an 18-month \"recess appointment.\" This is the constitutional equivalent of getting into Brown off the waiting list -- there\u0027s a small stigma attached, but you get over it by the time of the first freshman mixer.read whole post | permalink | comments06.20.2005 Jon Robin BaitzThe writer who dares to take on his own past has to be really fucking careful. Memory can get you into a lot of trouble because it involves these things called Other People. Just ask Lillian Hellman. (I could go on.) This odd hubris, this attempt to harvest a narrative as it were, out of the murky and mutually-owned past, can drive people who were part of that past crazy...read whole post | permalink | comments06.18.2005 Marty KaplanI watched Congressman Conyers\u0027 Downing Street Memo hearings on Cspan 3. Comcast, my cable provider, doesn\u0027t carry Cspan 3 in my Los Angeles neighborhood, so I had to watch it on my laptop. In this golden era, there\u0027s plenty for everyone: seven different broadcast and cable channels using their free public licenses and monopoly franchises in order to broadcast the same pathetic car chase, and not one channel airing what was arguably the most newsy and historic event of the day. And the FCC wants me to shout, \"Hooray! Diversity!\" for the Internet for letting me stream a two-inch screen online.read whole post | permalink | comments06.19.2005 Stephen BurtThings we -- and Bruce Wayne -- learn during Batman Begins:The worst weapons modern terrorists can use are the ones they\u0027d like to steal from us.

One was the decision by Zimbabwe\u0027s rather nutty ruler, Robert Mugabe, to sweep poor people out of the capital, Harare. The other story, also reflected in ads, committee-signed op-eds, and subway posters, concerns the 60th birthday of Burmese activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung Sang Suu Kyi.read whole post | permalink | comments06.19.2005 Robert SchlesingerRecall Dr. Frist -- the senator from Tennessee -- diagnosing the vegetative Mrs. Schiavo after an hour\u0027s video-tape consultation. Recall Rep. Tom DeLay -- he of the no medical training at all -- saying that Schiavo was not brain-dead and that the media was lying about that fact. Frist has since denied ever saying what he said. Has anyone heard anything from DeLay on this?read whole post | permalink | comments06.18.2005 Paul KrassnerMy friends Lane and Carol Sarasohn have an extraordinary grandchild, Flynn, who is on the front lines as he internalizes American culture. For example, his first words came, belatedly, straight out of a TV commercial: “Or your mattress is free!” More recently, he doodled “madeinchina.com.” When he learned that Haagen-Daz was a made-up word signifying nothing, he began making up words himself, such as “Lavortis,” which sounds like a new prescription drug.read whole post | permalink | comments06.19.2005 Randall RobinsonVisualize jihadist soldiers encamped on our soil, ensconced in the White House, occupying all of our major cities, speaking an unintelligible language, blowing up our neighborhoods, frisking our women, poking their guns through the windows of our cars, dragging our men from their spousal beds in the dark of night, killing some of our everyone – our men, our women, our children, our aged, our civilians, our revanchists, our patriots, our traitors.read whole post | permalink | comments06.18.2005 Hooman MajdThe NY Times’ editors agreed with President Bush’s dismissal of the Iranian elections as undemocratic, although oddly they did encourage Iranians to actually vote. The Iranians however, grateful as I’m sure they are to the NY Times for explaining how deficient their political process is, were probably not following its advice when they did exactly that, in numbers far greater than had been predicted. As of this writing, it appears that some 62% of eligible voters cast a ballot, a healthy turnout by any standards including our own.read whole post | permalink | comments06.18.2005 Richard BradleyA weird relationship gets weirder: Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes have gotten engaged. I love the way that tabloid editors are suddenly kissing up to the couple in the hopes that they\u0027ll be rewarded with a wedding exclusive. Consider this quote from Bonnie Fuller, editorial director of American Media, the parent company of Star magazine: \"It could last forever. It could last till death do them part. These are two people that are known to be serious individuals.\" It could last forever, sure. And, as the eminently quotable Mike Meyers would say, monkeys might fly out of my butt.read whole post | permalink | comments06.20.2005 Nellie B\"Pro-life\" activists constantly decried alleged suffering and neglect, if not outright abuse, and regularly stormed Hospice House Woodside to take food or water to Ms. Schiavo.
