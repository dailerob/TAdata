{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonA lot of the who, what, where, and how of the Boston bombing and what led up to it have already been answered and, no doubt, more details will eventually be filled in. The why, however, is the more elusive question. But it\u0027s also a crucial one. Why do we have so many disaffected young men in our culture, and what compels them to act out that disaffection in violent ways? As of 2006, boys accounted for 83 percent of arrests for violent crimes. By the age of 17, over a quarter of boys report having carried a handgun. In 2010, there were an estimated 756,000 gang members throughout the country. With Tucson, with Newtown, with countless other places, and now with Boston, the justifications may differ, but the end results have a lot in common. And so, likely, do the beginnings.Comments (360)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistWhen it comes to physical fitness, I\u0027ve always opted for the tried, true and traditional. I\u0027m perfectly happy with my light weight-training and a good jog in the park. But apparently I\u0027ve been missing out on a whole new wave of inventive, fun and sometimes hilarious workout routines -- from \"aerial yoga\" to \"booty ballet!\"Comments (30)Arianna HuffingtonI\u0027m delighted to announce The RaiseForWomen Challenge, an initiative to help women-focused nonprofits gain resources and recognition, in partnership with The Skoll Foundation, Crowdrise, and Sheryl WuDunn and Nick Kristof\u0027s Half the Sky Movement.

I was brought up believing that another man, who passed away in 2003, was my father. Now, in just days, the man who killed my real father will be sentenced for taking his life.Comments (113)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarWhile discipline is crucial during all stages of raising a child, discipline is not about getting even, inducing guilt, or even punishing -- all of which are forms of shaming a child. Instead, disciplining, at any age, is about correcting and guiding him toward more appropriate behavior.Comments (93)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkJust as the appalling alleged acts of Jared Loughner, James Holmes, Adam Lanza, Timothy McVeigh and others do not represent their entire communities, we cannot allow the appalling acts of Tamerlan and Dzhokhar to speak for their respective communities whether it be Islamic, Chechen or any other.Comments (39)Michael F. JacobsonExecutive Director, Center for Science in the Public InterestWe decided to analyze outbreak data to answer the question: What are the riskiest -- and the safest -- meat and poultry products? Which foods are most likely to make us sick and cause the most severe cases of illness?CommentsGlobal Fund for WomenAdvancing women\u0027s rights by investing in women-led organizations worldwideWhy women\u0027s health? Because when women control their bodies they control their destinies.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorYou can\u0027t order up your government dysfunction with a side of efficiency. You\u0027re either on the we\u0027re-the-Tea-Party-and-we\u0027re-here-to-shut-things-down bus or you\u0027re off of it.Comments (39)Scott AtranAnthropologist; Author, \u0027Talking to the Enemy: Faith, Brotherhood, and the (Un)Making of Terrorists\u0027Because would-be jihadis best thrive and act in mostly small, self-organizing groups within networks of family and friends -- not in large movements or armies -- their threat can only match their ambitions if fueled way beyond actual strength by publicity.Comments (138)William BradleyPolitical Analyst, NewWestNotes.comIf the Boston bombing was terrorism, as Tsarnaev claims, it looks like an especially boneheaded form of terrorism. Let\u0027s call it idiocratic terrorism. That\u0027s an adaptation of the title of the cult 2006 film Idiocracy, a satire about a dystopic future in which pretty much everyone is an idiot.CommentsAva NeyerMom, writerI went on Amazon and bought all the top books on baby sleep and development. I read through them all, as well as several blogs and sleep websites. I gathered lots of advice.Comments (156)Qasim RashidAuthor, \u0027The Wrong Kind of Muslim\u0027America is not under threat from radical Islam, but it is under threat from radical ignorance. This ignorance is a far more powerful and far more destructive force than any act of terror. I have experienced its horrific after effects.Comments (443)Mark WeinsteinLeading privacy advocate and founder of SGROUPLES.COMWe are living in an era where Facebook\u0027s Graph Search gives strangers greater access than ever to our \"private\" data and Google arbitrarily steals our passwords and emails. Did our forefathers misunderstand the demand for privacy as an inalienable right for law-abiding citizens in democracy?CommentsPeter Alexander MeyersPolitical theorist and author of \u0027Civic War and the Corruption of the Citizen\u0027What if Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is more like Adam Lanza than Mohamed Atta? What if Boston is more like Newtown than 9/11? Will we be able to see that? And are you prepared to come to grips with what it actually means?Comments (918)Larry MagidTechnology journalistAs we crave those new devices that I and other tech journalists frequently laud, we need to think of the total cost of ownership -- not just for us personally, but for the world and the planet we live on.CommentsRabbi Marc SchneierPresident, Foundation for Ethnic Understanding; Vice President, World Jewish CongressIn the wake of the horrific attacks in Boston last week perpetrated by two ethnic Chechen brothers who appear to have been motivated by extreme Islamist ideology, we are already seeing a dangerous tendency to blame the overall American Muslim community for the heinous deeds of a very few.Comments (60)Tony SchwartzPresident of The Energy Project; Author of Be Excellent at Anything: The Four Keys to Transforming the Way We Work and LiveI woke up one morning about four weeks ago and realized in a flash that I\u0027d hit a wall. Most days I can\u0027t wait to get to work. On this day, I struggled to get myself out of the house.Comments (25)Amitai EtzioniProfessor of international relations, George Washington UniversityI should have responded that laws in general are made for knaves. Good citizens are assumed to do what is right on their own. We apply these laws only to those who for one reason or another pay no mind to others and the common good.Comments (22)Amb. Marc GinsbergFmr. U.S. Ambassador to Morocco \u0026 White House Middle East AdviserThe Northern Caucasus of Russia have for decades been an \"off-the-radar\" safe haven for Islamic salafist terrorism. Tamerlan Tsarnaev\u0027s alleged terrorism in Boston has changed all that.Comments (30)White Ribbon AllianceNon-Profit OrganizationPlease join us in making needless maternal deaths a thing of the past -- for girls and women everywhere.CommentsEmma GrayAssociate Editor, HuffPost WomenGreat sex happens when both parties are into it, and telling women that they need to offer more sex in order for their husbands to maintain a fighting weight and sunny disposition seems like a twisted way to incentivize the act. So please, Wall Street Journal, stop discussing sex as though it\u0027s a duty instead of a pleasure. That isn\u0027t good for anyone.Comments (159)Jennifer \u0027JJ\u0027 DavisExecutive Director, Dell Women’s Entrepreneur NetworkWhat we know is that the rise of women-owned businesses and increasing the talent pool is essential to global economic growth and to giving kids, especially in the poorest parts of the world, a chance for a better life.CommentsRita WilsonEditor at Large, Huff/Post50; Actor, Producer, SingerCalling all fiction writers 50 and older! Huff/Post50 is seeking short-story submissions from our readers. We believe storytelling is a powerful art form and tool for self-expression, and we have a feeling there’s a lot of hidden writing talent among our audience just waiting to be discovered.Comments (119)Deborah Ramirez and Tara Lai QuinlanIt is true that not all terrorist acts in the United States can be avoided, and unfortunately more will succeed. But by incorporating voluntary, partnership-based community intelligence gathering practices into our national security infrastructure, we can improve our chances of preventing some attacks.CommentsSally SteenlandDirector, the Faith and Progressive Policy Initiative, Center for American ProgressAccording to the pundits and experts, the 1973 decision to legalize abortion outraged millions of Americans and mobilized them into a powerful movement to defend the rights of the unborn. But this tale turns out to be a myth.CommentsJudith Natelli McLaughlinPoet, author, lover of wordsEnough already! You are stressed out. Overworked. Underpaid. And buried under your day-to-day life. Sure, you could practice yoga, try to eat healthier and learn to rest more. But how about, for one brief moment, recapturing your youth. For me, these six things do the trick.Comments (43)Menachem RosensaftProfessor of law and son of Holocaust survivorsSixty-eight years after the liberation of Bergen-Belsen, 68 years after the end of the Holocaust, we may not ignore a disturbing resurgence of racist and neo-fascist political groups in at least three countries that belong to both the European Union and NATO.Comments (43)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesAmericans hold dear the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. But for gay people trapped in the closet under fear of losing their jobs, life offers anything but liberty and happiness.Comments (74)Erin GanjuCo-founder and CEO, Room to ReadIn societies such as sub-Saharan Africa where women are struggling to access their most basic right, education, a different type of \"Lean In\" circle is surfacing -- a camaraderie that does not play out in boardrooms, but rather in school rooms.CommentsChristiane TaubiraJustice minister and attorney general of FranceWhat are others losing? Or more directly, what could it be that is more precious for heterosexual couples and heterosexual parents, and how could this be changing it?Comments (21)Jonathan Handel, 2013.24.04Don Bacigalupi, 2013.24.04William Bradley, 2013.24.04Mark Rice, 2013.24.04Marie Woolf, 2013.24.04Joe Kort, Ph.D., 2013.24.04Chris Weigant, 2013.24.04Kyle Hillman, 2013.24.04Esha Bhandari, 2013.24.04Dave Scheidt, 2013.24.04Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"CAN\u0027T BE BOTHERED",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
