{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"The United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as COP21, begins later this month in Paris. There, as Newsweek put it, \"leaders and high-level officials from 196 parties have 12 days to reach an accord that could save the planet.\" That\u0027s not an exaggeration. The stakes are huge and we\u0027re not going to have many opportunities, with everyone gathered together, to come up with a solution equal to the problem. And the business world is going to have to be a part of that solution. So I\u0027m delighted that Michael Bloomberg, whose commitment to working toward solutions to this crisis is inspiring, has asked me to share my own thoughts on the subject as part of \"Businesses for Climate,\" a series on how businesses are addressing climate change leading up to the conference.We are living in one of the most turbulent times in human history. While the world\u0027s attention is focused on small groups of people that are hell-bent on destruction and terror, I will be in Paris to honor certain small groups of people that stand for the opposite of terror. They stand for life, cooperation and the health of the planet.ActorTed Cruz is so thrilled that someone who wants abortion providers to be killed is supporting him that he actually sent out a press release to celebrate the endorsement. Is that what this Republican primary has come to? No one should tolerate calls to put someone to death because of his or her legal profession.Actress, Activist, People For the American Way Foundation Board MemberAs we move toward war against ISIS, we must be vigilant -- to fairly allocate the burdens of who\u0027s called on to fight the war, to protect civil liberties, to protect innocent civilians abroad, to avoid hate and bigotry, and to fairly distribute the cost of paying for war.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027But now that I\u0027m aware of who I am, what I need, making it a priority is invigorating me and inspiring me in a new way. So I\u0027m here to say proudly that I\u0027m an introvert and I like to be by myself.writer and blogger, trustychucks.comThe people who broke into my home took a framed picture of my children that had been tucked away out of view and put it face down out in the open. This incident occurred as I\u0027m carrying out an investigative reporting project into Mexico\u0027s most high-profile human rights crime.Investigative journalistThe NRA will continue to attempt to recruit young men like Jacob into the gun culture. It therefore falls upon the rest of us to teach young Americans that guns will never be a solution to what ails them, either personally or politically.Executive Director, Coalition to Stop Gun ViolenceAffordable health insurance should not be a luxury. It is a necessity. Since I was elected to Congress in 2009, I have done everything I can to make sure that residents of the San Gabriel Valley can easily obtain affordable insurance that provides quality care.U.S. Representative for California\u0027s 27th DistrictThe fact is, people want live in cities with clean air -- and where people want to live, businesses want to invest.

The time is now to build new models of development that are climate compatible and lift people out of poverty.Cardinal Archbishop of Manila, Philippines; President of Caritas InternationalisLawyerLet\u0027s talk about education, let\u0027s talk about good, real data and how to get it, let\u0027s talk about calling trans and gender nonconforming people -- ?dead or alive -- by their proper names. If there\u0027s one thing my mom refusing to open her bills has taught me, it\u0027s that ignoring something doesn\u0027t make it go away.Filmmaker. Contrarian. Trans Woman of Color.Trump can pose as standing up to political correctness. The actual political correctness is how torture is used by war makers to get the tortured \"evidence\" they want to have a pretext for war and other hideous policies.Communications director, Institute for Public AccuracyA top government official with energy industry holdings huddles in secret with oil company executives to work out the details of a potentially lucrative \"national energy policy.\" Later, that same official steers billions of government dollars to his former oil-field services company. What country is this?Author, \u0027Mainstreaming Torture\u0027In response to Kristallnacht, the British government agreed to allow thousands of children -- no limit was ever publicly announced -- under the age of 17 to enter Great Britain from Germany. The understanding was that the children would emigrate from Britain when the conflict was over.Professor of international relations, George Washington UniversityI realized on November 24th 2014 that I needed to change direction. Up until then, I had dedicated myself to helping People of Color change- to attain employment authorization, or become US citizens, or attain corporate careers. From that evening on, I shifted focus- to helping White people changeDiversity and Inclusion Strategist, Antiracism ActivistOur immigration system is an immoral mess that throws obstacle after barricade in front of the huddled masses yearning to breathe free. It doesn\u0027t prevent terrorists from entering the U.S. And it certainly doesn\u0027t excel at making America more competitive or innovative.CEO/Founder of Cheezburger and co-founder of CircaChildren have their own set of needs. Don\u0027t add yours to theirs. Stay focused on being the parent. It\u0027s all about them. You had your time pre-divorce. Once the papers are signed, start living your new life.Marketing consultant, blogger, momAs you open yourself, others will open up as well, thus beginning a virtuous circle of vulnerability. Embrace those moments to share and be vulnerable. Now you have the power, and no one can take it from you.Senior Fellow, Harvard Business SchoolThe neighbourhoods outside of Paris, where the longtime Muslim European residents live have become a security problem. They have become slums which the central government actively avoids. Due to a lack of government involvement, a growing detachment from the State grows within the local Muslim youth. In these lost neighbourhoods, the terrorists of today and tomorrow are raised. These are the areas were ISIS operatives look to recruit new foreign fighters.WriterDark money not only dominates our campaigns; it also transfers political power to unknown actors. No doubt as intended, the increased flow of dark money is even harder to follow. For all we know, some of it comes from Manchuria.Novelist and contributing opinion writerIf a young person of color is fed a steady diet of movies, television shows, and plays in which characters that look like her exist only on the margins, how can we expect her to dream of taking center stage in school or work?Independent filmmaker, Theatre artist, and Education consultantSeveral years ago, when opposition to the repressive Assad regime began to erupt into open violence, I was frustrated that the U.S. was not being more assertive. While I continue to think we might have done more there early on, I have come to appreciate that the White House essentially got the policy right.Senior fellow, Center for American ProgressIn the somber days since ISIS terrorists killed 130 people in coordinated attacks on Paris, elected leaders from around the world have been searching for solutions. But far too many American politicians have fallen back, instead, on that old standby in times of crisis: Stirring up fear and finding someone, anyone, to scapegoat, no matter how unconnected the scapegoated person is with the problem at hand.President, People For the American WayThe incident reflects the growing brazenness of the Russians after their much-touted quasi-invasion of Syria. It also indicates the limits of Russian power, contrary to what President Putin loves to boast about.Contributing WriterI never felt my breasts defined me or who I was as a woman. Rather, my breasts were a part of me. Losing my breasts has been a brutal process, but having the opportunity to honor that part of me in advance has helped me to move forward.Mother of two grown childrenI miss my dad and mom every day. I especially miss their example of faith in action, a faith that was rooted in hope and love. In these times of terrorism, when mad men kill and terrify people around the world, I often close my eyes and repeat Dad\u0027s words.President, Save the Children Action NetworkLast week United Health Care, the country\u0027s largest health insurance company, announced that it was considering leaving the health care exchanges set up under the Affordable Care Act.

Much remains to be implemented, but we can say for certain that a movement has been launched.President, Pas de Calais region, FrancePresident, Northern France Chamber of Commerce and IndustryDespite the current violent unrest in Israel that is not yet a third intifada, I came away thinking that as hopeless as it too often seems, against all odds, there\u0027s still a solution to be had, still time for the sides to sit down at the table and make a deal. But not much.Senior writer, BillMoyers.com. Former senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.We must fervently voice our resolve and courage through an outpouring of compassion. We must not fear, but rather embrace the Syrian refugees.
