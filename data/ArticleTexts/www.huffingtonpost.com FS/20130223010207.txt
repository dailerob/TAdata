{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Actress and playwrightAn unusual number of films nominated for Oscars this year deal with real people, real histories, and real dilemmas. Artists brought the tools of big screen virtuosity, humor, beauty and sometimes brutality to images fished from the real world. At the same time, critics and members of the casual public asked that filmmakers be guardians of fact and responsible for the impact of their fiction.
