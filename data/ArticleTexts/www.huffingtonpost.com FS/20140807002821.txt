{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressPolitics Video FellowWhat\u0027s a politician to do when he or she takes a tough question from a reporter? Well, in general, they do this thing called \"dodging the question,\" dispensing a publicist-massaged talking point, or changing the subject, or spinning like a dervish, or just lying. (I suppose in some instances, there are those who answer questions as forthrightly as possible, too. It\u0027s a theory, anyway.) But then there are those special moments when wits and words fail the poor fool, and the politician -- suddenly gripped by animal panic -- attempts a clunkier contrivance.We have drifted very far from our understanding of the relationship that is supposed to exist between We the People, our government, and the businesses that our government allow to exist.Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureThe world is aflame. Religious minorities are among those who suffer most from increasing conflict. Pakistan is one of the worst homes for non-Muslims. The U.S. government should designate that nation as a \"Country of Particular Concern\" for failing to protect religious liberty, the most basic right of conscience.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteIt is becoming clear that researchers working on these pathogens don\u0027t agree on how best to study these particularly dangerous viruses and two groups have now emerged with different views.Scientist and science communication; mainly viruses and other micro-organismsIf we keep accepting this as reality, if we keep dieting and trying to fit into the stereotypes, or if we keep apologizing for not fitting into the stereotypes, we\u0027re doomed. No matter who you are, it\u0027s almost impossible to be \"pretty\" and \"thin\" to everyone. You will always be \"fat\" or \"ugly\" to someone.Writer, editor, drag queen enthusiastThe severely ill are now often jailed or homeless -- worse off than they were when I started psychiatry. I can speak from painful experience about the slippery downward slope of the past 50 years.Professor Emeritus, Duke UniversityGovernor Ventura, if you understand what the word \"honor\" means, you will end this search for greed by donating the $1.8M award to charity -- effective immediately -- just as Chris Kyle did with a large share of the proceeds from his best selling book, American Sniper.Policy advisorOn issue after issue facing our country, this is a Republican Party so obsessed with blocking the president -- and now suing the president -- that it has abdicated its most basic responsibility to govern.U.S. Senator from CaliforniaThe CIA, with the backing or orders of the White House, ran a worldwide network of secret prisons where it tortured men with barbaric techniques; kidnapped people from European streets; and then reportedly lied to Congress, the White House, and the Justice Department about it.Senior Legislative Counsel, American Civil Liberties Union’s Washington Legislative OfficeLife on Mars is inevitable. Now, such a statement may sound audacious, farfetched, and maybe even just a little bit crazy. It might be viewed as being just a wild prognostication about finding extraterrestrial microbial life on Mars - but it is based firmly in the realm of reality.Executive Director, Explore MarsThink your meal options are absurdly limited in Italy? Not so.Gluten free lifestyle writer. Author of forthcoming children\u0027s book.Unfortunately, thanks to the Supreme Court, this week we\u0027re not just celebrating the anniversary of the VRA -- we\u0027re fighting to rebuild it.Executive Vice President for Policy and Program, People For the American Way \u0026 People For the American Way FoundationThough the size of Warren Bennis\u0027s obituary in the New York Times was epic -- all six columns across, filling most of the space above the fold on the back page of the A section -- its text made no mention of something about him I always thought inextricable from who he was and the success he achieved.USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorIs it possible that the mere prospect of terrifying battle experiences is enough to traumatize soldiers before they actually deploy?Author, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027If you continue to end up in dead-end relationships, your fear of being alone is probably keeping you with the wrong partners.Veteran, licensed PsychologistTo respond to the growing rates of infection, citizens of the countries affected by Ebola need to be educated and approached in culturally relevant ways.Assistant professor of Africana Studies at Wellesley CollegeFocusing on issues of character and choice, when discussing poverty, suits conservatives because it emphasizes the causal role of \"agency\" rather than \"structure\" in the creation of social problems.Worrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsToday marks the 49th anniversary of the passage of a monumental law which forever changed our democracy. While some argue that the issues addressed by the Voting Rights Act of 1965 were long ago resolved, for the communities of South Florida, the law still plays a prominent role in our lives.U.S. representative from Florida\u0027s 26th congressional districtSomebody PLEASE nominate San Antonio Spurs Gregg Popovich for governor of Texas.Author, attorney, and member of the Blackfeet Nation and Suquamish territoriesIn Israel I am considered to be a lefty who hates his own country. In the States I\u0027m an occupier whose every attempt to dialogue is normalizing the occupation and diminishing the Palestinian struggle.Israeli student in NYC. Passionate about economics, human rights, peace in the Middle East, and soccer.The border isn\u0027t along the border alone, it\u0027s everywhere in America. It lives along the frayed lines of battered nerves, those of American-born citizens who fear their parents\u0027 deportation could come at any time (in many cases, grandparents of now second-generation Americans).Singer-songwriter/writer, \u0027The Greyhound Diaries\u0027; Former foreign correspondentHockey is a human game. No one wants to fail, and it can be an internal mental struggle to avoid dwelling on a mistake. A missed call can cause an official to lose his poise. He is more focused on what already happened than what\u0027s going on now.Retired NHL Player and NHL Referee, ECAC Director of Hockey Officiating, Chairman KHL Officiating Evaluation and Discipline CommitteesThe neglect of menstruation and its implications for the dignity, health and safety of women is increasingly well documented and urgently needs attention.Zimbabwean citizen and human rights defenderAs conservatives have been telling us since the wave of inversions began, we can\u0027t expect corporations to be \"moral\" or \"patriotic.\" If we write the rules that let them get away with immoral and unpatriotic betrayal of U.S. taxpayers, they will do it. So the next order of business is to get Congress to pass legislation.Co-Director, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureBy growing food locally and giving underserved urban neighborhoods access to fresh produce, jobs are created, local economies are strengthened by circulating dollars within the community, the harmful effects of food deserts are reduced, and consumers become engaged in learning how food is grown.U.S. Representative from Ohio\u0027s 11th DistrictBack in 2007 Rubio seemed to believe in the importance of solving climate change, and the scientific evidence has only grown stronger since then. What\u0027s also grown since 2007? The amount of money pumped into Rubio\u0027s campaign coffers by polluter interests.Director, NRDC Action FundThe transformation, albeit in the very early stages, of the U.S.-Israel relationship, isolation of Hamas and changing allegiances in the Middle East suggest that something will have to give.lincolnmitchell.comI wasn\u0027t expecting so many people to assume it was all a joke. After all, no one would think to ask a man if that proposal he put so much time and effort into was just for laughs. Is a woman proposing to a man so hilariously misguided that it could only ever be a prank?grad student and grammar enthusiastStop spending all day obsessing, cursing, perfecting your body like it\u0027s all you\u0027ve got to offer the world.Bestselling Author, Carry On, Warrior and Founder of MomasteryJim Carrey says many of us make fear-based decisions and turn our back on what we love to do and \"disguise it as practicality.\" The opposite is true -- following your passion is practical. And it\u0027s wonderful. How can you get started?Life Coach, New York CityDo we go to sleep, as modern science suggests, primarily seeking respite and restoration from the challenges of waking life? Or, as many sacred traditions around the globe teach, is the essence of sleep about returning to our true spiritual home?Sleep and dream specialistGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"NET NEUTRALITY BREAKTHROUGH",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
