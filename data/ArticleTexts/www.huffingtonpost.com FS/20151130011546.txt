{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, the nation stopped to give thanks. And not a moment too soon because it\u0027s especially important to remember all we\u0027re grateful for in the midst of news about a gunman opening fire at a Planned Parenthood clinic, the release of a video of a teenager being killed by police with 16 shots, rising hostilities between Russia and Turkey, and a political candidate making fun of a reporter\u0027s disability -- then denying it -- in a race turned ugly with xenophobia. All the more reason to count our blessings, not just at Thanksgiving, but every day -- especially now that science has confirmed the incredible health benefits of gratitude. And finally, as we head into a presidential election year, let\u0027s also be really grateful that we have the power to elect our leaders and reject those who don\u0027t reflect our values.Ted Cruz is so thrilled that someone who wants abortion providers to be killed is supporting him that he actually sent out a press release to celebrate the endorsement. Is that what this Republican primary has come to? No one should tolerate calls to put someone to death because of his or her legal profession.Actress, Activist, People For the American Way Foundation Board MemberWe are living in one of the most turbulent times in human history. While the world\u0027s attention is focused on small groups of people that are hell-bent on destruction and terror, I will be in Paris to honor certain small groups of people that stand for the opposite of terror. They stand for life, cooperation and the health of the planet.ActorThe United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as COP21, begins later this month in Paris. The stakes are huge and we\u0027re not going to have many opportunities, with everyone gathered together, to come up with a solution equal to the problem. And the business world is going to have to be a part of that solution.The thin child with big sad eyes and a braid hanging down her back, the one holding a bag containing all her worldly possessions with one hand, and with the other she clutches her baby brother: that refugee girl was once me.SupermodelIf we are serious about changing the climate, we need to get serious about changing agriculture.Author of \"The Omnivore\u0027s Dilemma,\" \"In Defense of Food\"Donald Trump\u0027s toxic comments about immigrants and women are completely counter to the spirit of my late husband Gene Kelly. Not only would Gene be appalled by Trump\u0027s deplorable words and actions, he would be stricken that such depravity could be tolerated in a race for President of the United States.Writer, Trustee of The Gene Kelly Image TrustThe fact is, people want live in cities with clean air -- and where people want to live, businesses want to invest. One way to do that is by investing in low carbon transportation infrastructure -- from bus rapid transit to bike share systems -- that help reduce congestion and improve mobility.Fmr. three-term mayor of New York City; Founder of Bloomberg Philanthropies and Bloomberg LPToday, we are faced with the same choice we have confronted in the past -- whether to give into fear and prejudice or align ourselves with our highest ideals.Founding Co-director, Social Security WorksCOP21 represents one of those rare opportunities to change the course of human history. I believe that a net-zero target is achievable by 2050. It shouldn\u0027t worry us. To be honest, I couldn\u0027t think of a more exciting opportunity. .Founder, Virgin GroupAffordable health insurance should not be a luxury. It is a necessity. Since I was elected to Congress in 2009, I have done everything I can to make sure that residents of the San Gabriel Valley can easily obtain affordable insurance that provides quality care.U.S. Representative for California\u0027s 27th DistrictWhen we cook with a spiritual compass, we are cooking with intention in order minimize waste and be as efficient as possible. In America, we throw away roughly 40 percent of our food, but if you truly know how to cook, you know how to reuse food throughout the week in order to reduce waste and be cost-efficient.Award-Winning Chef, Restaurateur \u0026 AuthorThe case of Abigail Hanna--the pretty, blonde 21-year-old who allegedly kidnapped a toddler she once cared for--has the media fascinated. How can someone like her become, as the Daily Beast calls her, \"the babysitter from hell\"?Author, research psychologist and gender scholarThe scientific community agrees on a crucial fact: we must leave most remaining fossil fuels in the ground, or our children and future generations are screwed. Yet Obama is not proposing the action required for the essential change in energy policy direction.Climatologist and Adjunct Professor, Columbia University Earth InstituteThe reality is that for the summit to succeed, business leaders must and will stand shoulder to shoulder with world leaders and play a critical supporting role in empowering national governments to agree a path to prosperity for us all.CEO, UnileverI\u0027ve never had the privilege of visiting Idaho so I can\u0027t say that I know you. I don\u0027t know your specific fears or experiences and I would never presume to minimize or dismiss them. All I can say is that we\u0027re all Americans, and we share the ability to talk to each other with an open mind and an open heart.Truman National Security Fellow, civil servant in the U.S. Department of Defense and a graduate of Georgetown\u0027s School of Foreign ServiceEvery person deserves a safe, stable place to call home. But in the wealthiest nation in the world, more than half a million Americans sleep on the streets or spend their Thanksgiving in a homeless shelter. Many of them are children.Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban DevelopmentThe National Mining Association\u0027s president recently wrote that the impact of uranium mining on Grand Canyon National Park is \"virtually nonexistent.\" That\u0027s about as reassuring as BP saying that deep water oil drilling poses virtually no risk to the Gulf of Mexico.Former U.S. Senator from Colorado; Board member, Grand Canyon TrustLove or hate it, shopping is our national pastime. It\u0027s even easier now that you can do it in your pajamas in front of your computer, or on the phone in between texting while driving. But for many, those new black shopping days signify a time of worry -- maybe even desperation.Money Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsAs we move toward war against ISIS, we must be vigilant -- to fairly allocate the burdens of who\u0027s called on to fight the war, to protect civil liberties, to protect innocent civilians abroad, to avoid hate and bigotry, and to fairly distribute the cost of paying for war.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027Yet, in the wake of five protestors being shot while peacefully protesting the death of Jamar Clark near the Fourth Precinct police station in Minneapolis, it is once again revealed that the most longstanding and deadly terrorist groups in America have always operated under the banner of white supremacy.Award-Winning Author of Freestyle: Reflections on Faith, Family, Justice, and Pop Culture; Founding Pastor of Joy Tabernacle A.M.E. Church in Dallas, TexasWhile I applaud the sentiment that Israelis and Palestinians are closely connected, what struck me the most is his characterization of himself, as if being a Jew means automatic support of Netanyahu\u0027s policies, regardless of how misguided they may be.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUWe may have to make some tough choices, including some new alterations to policy to better protect our country. However, if America is going to live up to its definitional ideals, we cannot simply shun the rescue of tiny portion of God\u0027s most vulnerable children, irrespective of the faith they embrace.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityI am trying to stay above water. Trying not to drown in the poisonous pool of hate and ignorance.

That\u0027s important for all of us to remember, not just those who are tasked with reaching an agreement in Paris.Executive Director, The Sierra ClubEquality should be the standard for anyone in the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus. And Polis, Sinema and Maloney failed miserably at meeting that standard.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostThanksgiving is a time for family, food and joy, but unfortunately it can also be a source of health-impacting stress and anxiety for many. Between the influx of visitors and the necessary shopping, cooking and cleaning up, there can be far too little time devoted to reflective conversation with friends and family.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorIn the discussions of the events now taking place on an increasing number of college campuses the phrases \"free speech\" and \"academic freedom\" are routinely invoked. Neither is an appropriate rubric for the analysis of what is happening.Davidson-Kahn Distinguished University Professor and Professor of Law at Florida International University; Floershimer Distinguished Visiting Professor of Law at Cardozo Law SchoolCharging Officer Van Dyke with murder is a critical step towards justice, but it can\u0027t be the beginning and end of this story. Some have used the fact that Officer Van Dyke has been charged with murder to advance the narrative that he was a \"bad apple\" acting outside the culture of the department.Deputy Legal Director and the Director of the Center for Justice, ACLUThere\u0027s this thing that happens whenever I speak about or write about women\u0027s issues. Things like dress codes, rape culture and sexism. I get the comments: Is this really that big of a deal? Aren\u0027t you being overly sensitive? Every. Single. Time.

Blogger at DriftingThrough.comThe NRA will continue to attempt to recruit young men like Jacob into the gun culture.
