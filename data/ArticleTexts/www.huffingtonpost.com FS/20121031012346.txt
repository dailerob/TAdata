{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Hurricane Sandy may have been downgraded from Category 2 after it barreled through the Caribbean, but it sure didn\u0027t feel like it. What was unmistakable, though, was how quickly and completely Sandy downgraded our election. As Sandy moved in, the election was almost literally moved off the map. But Sandy didn\u0027t just knock the campaign off the front pages; it transformed it as well. At a moment of extreme polarization, Mother Nature brought us together. Suddenly the artificial walls that our political process erects to separate us into little demographic micro-groups to make us believe we have no mutual interests got blown away by the massive hurricane. The collective effort, the we\u0027re-all-in-this-together spirit, has been great to see. But it shouldn\u0027t take a natural disaster to make us tap into our natural humanity.Read Post | Comments (93)George Lakoff, 10/30/12Author, The Political Mind, Moral Politics, Don\u0027t Think of an Elephant!Global warming is real, and it is here. It is causing -- yes, causing -- death, destruction, and vast economic loss. And the causal effects are getting greater with time. We cannot merely adapt to it. The costs are incalculable. What we are facing is huge.Read Post | Comments (603)Jamie Lee Curtis, 10/30/12Actress and children\u0027s book authorYes, it was a super storm but we are a super society which is super because of our ability to help ourselves and each other.Read Post | Comments (32)William K. Black, 10/30/12Assoc. Professor, Univ. of Missouri, Kansas City; Sr. regulator during S\u0026L debacleThere are credible warnings that Obama intends to seek a \"grand bargain\" causing the U.S. to adopt the type of austerity program that threw the Eurozone back into a gratuitous recession. Worse, Obama intends to begin to unravel the safety net (Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid) to convince the Republicans to enter into this Faustian bargain.Read Post | Comments (344)Robert Reich, 10/30/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Lies like the latest from Mitt Romney, financed by deep pockets, are hard to refute, but they must be refuted. Otherwise, there is no accountability in our democracy.Read Post | Comments (114)Erika Katz, 10/30/12Author, Bonding Over BeautyHalloween is easy when they are little. You chaperone them trick or treating at 5 p.m. and they are in bed by 8 p.m. But, tweens and teens still love Halloween and want to roam the streets by themselves in the dark. How do you keep them safe? Here are 10 safety tips.Read Post | CommentsAl Gore, 10/30/12Chairman, Current TVHurricane Sandy is a disturbing sign of things to come.

El-Erian, 10/30/12CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOIf history is a guide, and notwithstanding the significant devastation created by Hurricane Sandy, there should be limited expectation that even this stark situation will prompt Congress to take concerted and meaningful action.Read Post | CommentsRob Delaney, 10/30/12Comedian and writerAs I looked at these pictures of the babies being evacuated, I had a depressing thought. What are the financial situations of these babies\u0027 parents? Are they poor? Do they have insurance? Are they on Medicaid?Read Post | CommentsScott Mendelson, 10/30/12Film critic at Mendelson\u0027s Memos, Valley Scene MagazineI don\u0027t demand subversion of the status quo in every would-be genre film.  But Wreck-It Ralph promises next-generation gaming and delivers old-school Nintendo in a shinier box.Read Post | CommentsShepard Fairey, 10/30/12ObeyGiant.comI want to see this country move forward, not backward, and I know that four more years of Obama in office will have our country and our planet looking far more like the ones I want to see than a Romney presidency ever could.Read Post | Comments (38)Matthew Dowd, 10/30/12Political strategistA few months ago, I said that there would be five events in October that would determine who was going to get elected: three presidential debates, one vice-presidential debate, and an unexpected event. I never anticipated a historic hurricane hitting the most populous regions of the country.Read Post | CommentsMichael B. Keegan, 10/30/12President, People for the American WayIf President Obama wins with the help of Latino voters, he will have a strong mandate to create clear and lasting immigration reform. And Republicans will have to think twice before hitching their futures on the politics of demonization and exclusion.Read Post | Comments (70)David Berri, 10/30/12Co-author, \u0027Stumbling on Wins\u0027; Economics professor, Southern Utah UniversityYes, the Thunder are still an above average team. But Harden\u0027s production of wins will be very difficult to replace. So for the 2012-13 season, it doesn\u0027t look like the Thunder will be favored to get back to the NBA Finals.Read Post | CommentsMaxwell Kennedy, 10/29/12Author, attorney and environmentalistA tough friend of mine used to say, \"Watch what people do, not what they say.\" I think it is also important to listen to what they say is just or fair. Personal determinations of what is \"fair\" tells a lot about a person -- and this applies to no one more than Mitt Romney right now.Read Post | Comments (146)Tom Angell, 10/30/12Founder and Chairman, Marijuana MajorityThree legalization initiatives on state ballots are drawing support from voters, newspapers, civic groups, celebrities and even some members of law enforcement. But guess who else is speaking out in support of changing marijuana laws?Read Post | CommentsRabbi Shmuley Boteach, 10/30/12Rabbi and WriterWe are capable of being positive and unified, even while we contest some of the great political issues of our day. We can be one people while we entertain very different opinions.

It\u0027s called dating ADD. Symptoms of this disorder are similar to the more common form of ADD: easy distractibility, lack of focus and inability to stick to a task.Read Post | CommentsPaul B. Tripp, 10/30/12Author and retired naval officerThe first time I remember contemplating suicide I was 9 years old. An awkward pre-teen raised in a small Montana town with a rough home life and an even rougher time at school -- I was a target of bullying in every aspect of my life.Read Post | CommentsSimon Jackman, 10/30/12Professor of Political Science, Stanford UniversityAs we enter the final week of the campaign, an obvious question to ask is how to convert the state-by-state probabilities of an Obama or Romney lead in the polls to probabilities that Obama or Romney will win the state and the election itself.Read Post | Comments (22)Michelangelo Signorile, 10/29/12Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesIn my last blog post I quoted Mitt Romney making shocking remarks that were highlighted in a Boston Globe story last week.

If the numbers are bad, it could give Romney the last-second momentum he needs. If the numbers are good, Obama could waltz to victory.Read Post | Comments (59)Tom Zeller Jr., 10/27/12Senior Writer, The Huffington PostSo what\u0027s going on?
