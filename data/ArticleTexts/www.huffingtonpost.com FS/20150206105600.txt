{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Chief Executive Officer, The King CenterLong gone are the days of the liberal consensus that characterized the United States from Franklin Roosevelt\u0027s New Deal, to Harry Truman\u0027s Fair Deal, to John F. Kennedy\u0027s New Frontier, and finally, to, perhaps the most liberal reforms of them all--Lyndon Johnson\u0027s Great Society. Shamefully, the Court\u0027s systematic dismantling of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act and the Court\u0027s anticipated modification of the Fair Housing Act may cause it to be remembered by history as a strict constructionist Court with neither heart nor soul. Within five years, it has erased the gains of almost 60 years of progressive reform that sought to foster a spirit of what my father called \"interconnectedness.\" This is extremely detrimental to our nation, to our global citizenry and to the realization of the \"Beloved Community.\"With the murder of Moaz al-Kasasbeh, the Islamic State knew that the resulting public outrage in Jordan would push Jordan toward accepting a larger role in the fight against ISIS. And it also knows that, in assuming this role, the Jordanian King would be even further aligning himself with the United States and, indirectly, with a competing Shi\u0027a alliance involving Iran, Iraq, Syria and Hezbollah.Author, \u0027Dangerous Ground\u0027Hopefully Ashton Carter, President Obama\u0027s nominee for Secretary of Defense, will make a strong commitment to closing down Guantanamo before the end of President Obama\u0027s term. His confirmation hearing will be a key indicator of how committed he is to this goal.Senior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstWomen are still most definitely outsiders in places that matter, not least in finance. And we saw last fall what a Wall Street outsider can uncover, just the latest woman in finance to blow the whistle.Author, \"Unaccountable\"We\u0027ve barely heard from the other clown-car passengers and already Huckabee has navigated his way through at least three major new cycles in which he says something obnoxious then walks it back, but only after the GOP base scarfs it down like, I don\u0027t know, whatever it eats.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027I am not a scientist. I am not smart enough for that. But I am a mother. And although I am not really smart enough for that either, I do know autism from that angle. I know the rigidity and the obsessiveness and the rage over having an aide in school. I know the quiet longing that comes with being different or weird, because I see it every single day.WriterThe fantasy that millions of people will simply disappear if we just have stricter laws, the old \"self-deportation\" theory and the lynchpin of the Romney campaign in 2012, did not work as a political strategy and is laughable as a policy.Congressman Representing Illinois\u0027 4th District in ChicagoAs approval of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline appears to be resting on extremely thin ice, TransCanada on Wednesday announced they would be entering the oil-by-rail business to help further their tar sands investments.California Philanthropist \u0026 Climate ChampionYou want to have an affair. You haven\u0027t even been married long. Wait a sec, are you married or just roommates? You check and yep, your marriage license is in your nightstand drawer. The wedding video that cost $800 is covered with dust. No question -- you\u0027ve made a lifelong commitment.Humorist at \"Once Upon Your Prime\"There\u0027s a problem with the rising crescendo of alarm about lone wolves: most of it simply isn\u0027t true. There\u0027s nothing new about the \"threat\" and the concept is notoriously unreliable, as well as selectively used.Senior Writer/Editor - ACLUUsing purchase metadata with no credit card numbers, names or any other simple identifiers, the report\u0027s co-authors found they could track a specific person\u0027s purchases using three factors: a receipt, an Instagram and a Tweet about a new purchase or a Facebook post.Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911In both American Sniper and that other controversial recent release The Interview, Americans are the heroes and foreigners are the targets. And not just foreigners but furriners: an undifferentiated group of people so alien in their ways that they are practically subhuman.Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogWhy is meditation being highlighted now? In today\u0027s complex society with excessive information, top leaders might feel that logical thinking is not always a valid means of finding solutions. What lies beyond logic is \"intuition,\" and meditation can be an effective means to bring forth the voice within.Journalist, newscasterJordan\u0027s boundless generosity has provided a safe haven for the human tide of refugees that have been thrust upon it from war-ravaged Syria and Iraq.Fmr. U.S. Ambassador to Morocco; White House Middle East AdviserAs a generation, we face a choice: either continue the disastrous environmental, and economic food policies of the Boomers or make new choices regarding how and what we eat. It\u0027s time for us to start hunting.Entrepreneur \u0026 FilmmakerWhen companies go bankrupt, a debt-equity swap is a fair and efficient solution. The analogous approach for Greece is to convert its current bonds into GDP-linked bonds. If Greece does well, its creditors will receive more of their money; if it does not, they will get less.Professor at Columbia University and a Nobel Laureate in EconomicsPresident Obama is evidently taking a ration of right-wing blow back for comments at today\u0027s National Prayer Breakfast comparing the heinous actions of ISIS to the heinous actions of the Crusades.Episcopal priest and activist from Pasadena, Calif.It isn\u0027t hard to empathize with the guy who just wants to slow down and smell the roses, especially because most moms I know beat themselves up for not being more present-focused, mindful, and calm with the kids.www.drpsychmom.comIt\u0027s like signing up to be a leper. Everyone shunned us because only a \"dishonorable\" family couldn\u0027t keep its house in order.FilmmakerThe word\u0027s a dog whistle that releases the hounds, if not the Foxes. And yet, one of my rules of thumb in this work is that when policy does a lot of something and that something cannot be spoken of, we\u0027re courting dysfunction and distortion.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorFor many people, the winter blahs might have already kicked in. Or maybe you\u0027re resisting feeling down and teetering on the possibility of giving in or pushing through the next few months as you anticipate spring.Life Coach \u0026 Empowerment CoachAs we celebrate Black History Month, I challenge us to dig deeper and recognize that some of our most honored and courageous trailblazers in the movement were immigrants.Coordinator of the Black Immigration Network and the Arizona Organizer for the Black Alliance for Just Immigration (BAJI)In the 40 years since Congress established strict restrictions on campaign financing, the Chamber of Commerce and the Supreme Court have hacked away at government oversight with their First Amendment sickles.Co-Founder, Ben \u0026 Jerry\u0027s Ice Cream and Head Stamper, StampStampede.orgTreat your \"failed\" romances with gratitude, knowing that you deserve to commit yourself to an incredible person. Pour yourself into your friends and encourage their dreams and aspirations. And don\u0027t fear death. Fear not allowing yourself to live the life that you deserve.Author. Blogger. Adventurer. And everything in-between.On Wednesday the European Central Bank announced it would no longer accept Greek government bonds and government-guaranteed debt as collateral. But Syriza\u0027s leadership are playing it smart. They responded to the ECB\u0027s assault without animosity or denunciations. They want the world to know who is the aggressor here and who is being reasonable.Co-director, Center for Economic and Policy Research, Washington, D.C.While Obamacare has been a step in the right direction, more and more people across the country understand that a single-payer healthcare system is the only way to guarantee quality care and at the same time reduce medical costs.Dean of the US House of Representatives | Ranking Member, House Judiciary CommitteeWe must tell our stories from the boardroom to the courtroom; and from the outhouse to the White House. That we are at the heart of the American story, and without our story, there is no authentic American story.Graduate student, Yale UniversityEvery day brings more headlines in the European debt drama: \"Greece elects anti-austerity government.\" \"Greek Finance Minister says he won\u0027t negotiate with the \u0027Troika.\u0027\" \"Anti-austerity movements gain ground across Europe.\" What\u0027s behind these stories? What does the future hold? Are there any implications for the U.S.? Here\u0027s an overview of the situation as it currently stands.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourSome have suggested that it would be better for Congress to legislate net-neutrality rules instead of relying on the FCC\u0027s rule-making authority. That would be fine too; after all, Congress always has the prerogative to legislate. But the open Internet we know today occurred under our existing communications laws and the FCC\u0027s watch, so passing a law to trump the FCC\u0027s rules is premature.U.S. Senator from HawaiiScientists Nick Epley and Juliana Schroeder believe there is something about speech that conveys not just the content of a person\u0027s mind but the capacity for reasoning, thoughtfulness and intellect. If they are right, job seekers should appear more thoughtful and intelligent when given the opportunity to speak, rather than write, about themselves. That\u0027s what they set out to test.Author, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027We have forgotten that we benefited from the generosity of those who went before us. And now it is our turn to be generous, now it is our turn to return the favor, but we don\u0027t want to.Philip Gulley is a Quaker pastor, speaker and author of 20 books.
