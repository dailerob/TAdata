{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"CEO and Co-Founder of UberWhile the dangers of drunk driving are now well known, drowsy driving is still a silent epidemic. Research suggests that tired drivers are responsible for as many as 1.2 million crashes a year which tragically kill 8,000 people. Those numbers are sobering, but hardly surprising given that one study found that being awake for 17 to 19 hours -- a normal day for many of us! -- causes cognitive impairment equal to having a blood alcohol level of .05 percent. That\u0027s just under the legal limit in many US states. Stay up just a few hours more, and it\u0027s equivalent to 0.1 percent -- legally drunk. It doesn\u0027t have to be this way, which is why The Huffington Post is teaming up with Uber and Toyota to raise awareness of the issue and help save lives.Whether you support Bernie or Hillary, how many of you want Republicans to abolish freedom of reproductive choice? I thought so. But here\u0027s the kicker -- in much of the country, the GOP already has.Novelist and contributing opinion writerHuman beings are waking up early in the mornings to drive to offices to perform imaginary business in imaginary markets involving imaginary customers using imaginary money to buy imaginary goods and services instead of simply enjoying their non-imaginary and most definitely real lives with each other.Writer and basic income advocateWhile most of us may not always literally get to sleep, we do have an advantage of pursuing sleep at night. But what about plumbers, fire and water restoration experts, tow truck drivers, or others who are on call for 24-hour emergencies...for us? Do they sleep well?Founder and Chief Marketing Officer, Angie\u0027s ListIn military circles, there is a term to describe this type of behavior.

The ASPCA was proud to work with Walmart on this historic decision.ASPCA President and CEOThe way working people win justice is by joining together and taking a stand. Our wins this week from coast to coast show more than anything the power of workers organizing.McDonald\u0027s worker, Fight for $15 activistMcDonald\u0027s worker; Fight for $15 activistService-year programs are critical to New York City for more than one reason. They help address our city\u0027s critical needs, but they also develop our city\u0027s workforce and build civic leaders.109th Mayor of New York CityThe major national media are interested mainly in personalities and in the money behind the personalities. Political reporting is dominated by stories about the quirks and foibles of the candidates, and about the people and resources behind them.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027I’ve noticed there’s often something missing from most conversations regarding solo travel: The people you encounter along the way. Here are eight reasons why I travel alone to meet other people.Lifestyle Blog Editor, The Huffington PostThe Eastern Mediterranean island of Cyprus leapt into the headlines with the landing of a hijacked EgyptAir plane. It will soon make headlines again as the US and the UN move to end the 42-year division of that country, through its capital city of Nicosia, by 40,000 Turkish troops. These negotiations will have significant ramifications for the region and the U.S.President, Manatos \u0026 ManatosI realised I was fed up with clinging to my sofa like a raft on the weekend, wishing I had the energy to do all of the things I wanted. And I was definitely fed up with feeling like I was on the brink of work overwhelming me all the time.Executive Editor, The Huffington Post UKThere are legitimate reasons for not supporting Hillary Clinton, but they are, almost inevitably, only partially complete. She pays a very high price, as a candidate, for her lady genes.Feminist, writer, and satirist (not always in that order)Players who take shortcuts to success may advance for a while, but end up hurting themselves and their teams in the end. Campaigns who ignore the fundamentals of a campaign by failing to turn the self expression of activism into movement-building or organizing will fall short.Chair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusWhen I argue for greater compassion towards addicts, I often get somebody replying who says something like: \"Then you shouldn\u0027t call them \u0027addicts.\u0027 Stop using that word.\" It\u0027s a serious argument, and one that is worth thinking through in public.The full spectrum of human relationships with drugsVery few people in the United States have any appetite for revolution, or anything like it. Even the ones attracted to the man who\u0027s slinging the term around. Bernie Sanders supporters are all after incremental change, just like Hillary supporters are, whether they\u0027re self-aware enough to know so or not.Actor, author, screenwriter, and journalistToo many women and men are getting hurt on our campuses, and too much of our culture still accepts this reality as inevitable. There are incredible advocates on every campus in this country and It\u0027s On Us seeks to connect us - and in so many ways, this effort is succeeding.Student, advocate, writer, coffee enthusiastThe drone war will be as much Obama\u0027s legacy as health care or reshaping of the Supreme Court. The program may have been born under the George W Bush administration, but it has expanded and grown to be the focal point of the GWOT over the past seven years.eoinhiggins.comBeing a decent parent takes hard work and a lot of energy. Some folks might have more tools, resources and energy to give to multiple children. But I don\u0027t, or at least I didn\u0027t at the time. Acknowledging that fact about myself allowed me to make what was ultimately the best decision for my family.Media funded and run by women.We are excited to launch Talk to Me, a new HuffPost series that is classic HuffPost: engagement, conversation, and connecting people across boundaries.Creator and executive producer of \"Talk To Me\" at The Huffington PostThere can be large benefits to countries from trading, and there is no doubt that the United States is enormously richer as a result of international trade. But that hardly means that everyone was benefitted by the patterns of trade over the last three decades, nor is it a reason to support the TPP.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027April is Autism Awareness Month. While I truly hope Autism Awareness Month becomes Autism Acceptance Month, I realize there is a gaping awareness issue.Author of two books, artist, autism advocate, University of Miami law studentThe fundamental problem is this: The U.S.A. is becoming more and more diverse in its racial and ethnic background, its religion, its lifestyle choices and its thinking. Meanwhile, the Republican party has become the party of reaction against what America has become. The Trump/Cruz party openly embraces racism, nativism, misogyny and lack of toleration.Co-Founder, Democracy PartnersThe Post certainly didn\u0027t lie; it simply made a big mistake. But corrections never do catch up with mistakes. And combined with a widespread and generally unwarranted mistrust of Clinton by the American people, those mistakes will certainly make her life and candidacy even more difficult.Retired producer for NBC Nightly NewsIn short, most guys have been taught since birth that when it comes to pain, you suck it up. Which means we don\u0027t get to the doctor for regular checkups. Which means we ignore chest pains until they become heart attacks. Which means we die too young.Financial Expert and Best Selling AuthorBut what does Ivana think? In response to that question, likely asked by no one, the former wife of Donald Trump has weighed in on her ex-husband, why he will be good for the country, and how she advises him on his 2016 campaign.Attorney; NBCNews.com Contributor, CNN Opinion columnistHuffPost just launched Talk To Me, a new video series to inspire authentic conversations between parents and children. I thoroughly enjoyed my conversation with my son, Logan, which we recorded with just one take (as I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll be able to tell).Campus MinisterEighty-four percent of Americans think money has too much influence in U.S. politics. Why is there such overwhelming consensus on this point? Because it reflects a common-sense understanding of how our elections run and why the government fails to adopt available solutions to our biggest problems.President, Public CitizenI grew paler and thought ah, I must be fair now. I would wink at myself in the mirror as I got ready in the mornings. Now I am suitable and desirable and marriage material. And I carried on like that till college.Writer, editor, and zine queenAs curator of the Oscar de la Renta exhibition, now at de Young Museum of Fine Arts, in San Fransisco, it was a great privilege to illustrate in eight galleries, the comprehensive and profound depths of his career, from his early works in the Sixties, under the label Elizabeth Arden, to his own name, to the end of his life, when he died in October 2014.Contributing editor, VogueBut I am not alone. On average, one person dies by suicide every 40 seconds. This means that each year there are over a million families, like ours, living with the aftershocks of suicide.
