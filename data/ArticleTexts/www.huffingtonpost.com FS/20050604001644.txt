{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AriannaOkay, it’s Friday, time to gear up for another round of missed opportunities and vital questions that won’t be asked on this week’s edition of Meet the Press. Welcome to Week Three of The Russert Watch. For those of you who missed our previous installments (and we know who you are), this is the plan: every Friday we’ll give you a sneak peak at the guest list for the upcoming MTP (gathered from our moles on the show... okay, we’ll actually just look at the MTP website) and offer up a few of the hard-hitting questions we’re sure that our man Tim won’t be asking. We’ll also ask for your suggestions for questions Russert should be asking his guests, and we’ll post the best of them. And if Russert doesn’t take them, they will stand in virtual reality as a reprimand, conspicuous by their absence. Then, on Sunday, after the show, we will count the bodies...Read More06.03.2005 Jesse KornbluthHidden in the \"Leave No Child Behind\" Act is a demand for public high schools to give contact information for its students to military recruiters. Gee, why would recruiters want that information? Maybe so they can call kids turning 18 and suggest they\u0027d do well to \"be all you can be.\" What happens if a school refuses to hand over those phone numbers? It could lose federal funds -- and, in effect, leave all its students behind...read whole post | permalink | comments06.02.2005 Matt CooperI was delighted to see that a bipartisan group of attorneys general from the states and the District of Columbia have filed a brief to the Supreme Court asking them to take the case that I’ve brought to the high court.read whole post | permalink06.03.2005 Paul RieckhoffDavid Corn is exactly right about the Take Back America Conference and the lack of Iraq War discussion. The progressives are more afraid of the war in Iraq than a 19 year-old kid approached by an Army recruiter at the mall. So keep it up, progressives. Keep avoiding the war talk. McCain, Giuliani, and Hagel will be more than happy to talk about Iraq. They\u0027ll make you look soft on defense issues, slap you around in \u002706, and then kick your asses in another Presidential election in \u002708. And you\u0027ll be left with another few years of cozy conferences and navel-gazing, bitching about how you are misunderstood in the red states. It\u0027s the war, stupid.read whole post | permalink | comments06.03.2005 Robert A GeorgeWhat Watergate should still tell us -- but Stein, Noonan and Buchanan appear to willfully ignore -- is that a corrupt administration is dangerous. Men in the Nixon administration went to jail, not just for \"dirty tricks,\" but for multiple break-ins (which, it is true, Felt also did in the FBI\u0027s pursuit of violent radical groups), misusing the CIA for political ends, payoffs, cover-ups, etc. These actions, committed domestically, had reverberations around the globe...read whole post | permalink06.03.2005 Gary HartAmerican political parties, as we have known them for two centuries, are disintegrating. They are being replaced by shifting coalitions that are forming and reforming constantly.

Bush supporter who\u0027s skimming through the Huffington Post to see who the liberal traitors and agitators are, I have some questions for you. And these are honest, \"I really am looking for an answer\" questions, not rhetorical snarky questions. I\u0027m really looking to figure out this divide in our country between the so called true patriots and the shiftless liberals. So help me out and then when you see me on the road with my \"Wal-Mart: Low Wages, Low Morals... Always\" bumper sticker, feel free to flip me off.read whole post | permalink | comments06.02.2005 Kelly PrestonWhere in all of medicine is a diagnosis of disease made strictly by talking to someone? Would a parents subject their child to chemotherapy if there were no evidence of cancer cells? Would they take a doctor’s word for it that he could diagnose their child with cancer simply by asking the child some questions or observing his behavior?read whole post | permalink06.02.2005 Harry ShearerDuring the election campaign, Larry King interviewed President and Laura Bush. Just before the interview started, Larry (1) patted himself on the back for his fine interviewing style and, (2) put in a plug for himself as a panelist on one of the then-upcoming debates. In passing, he ignored the fascinating hint dropped by G.W. and Laura of the \"drinking debate\". That\u0027s called a nose for news. LINKpermalink | comments06.02.2005 Bill DiamondI think Arianna’s working the wrong metaphor when she compares the Democratic faithful to “parched earth, desperate for some drops of truth about Iraq from their elected representatives.” Seems to me the Democratic faithful are more whipped dog than delicate desert flower ready to bloom. Watching Hillary ever-so-delicately maneuver herself for ‘08 has the look and feel of a Hummer trying to fit into a compact parking space.read whole post | permalink | comments06.03.2005 Hooman MajdThe Bush administration has made it clear that it doesn’t believe the elections in Iran are democratic (as opposed to say, Pakistan?). A low turnout or better still, a boycott by “freedom-loving” Iranians, would serve the administration quite well. But failing that (and the last “low” turnout in Iran was 67% of the voting population), what outcome would the U.S. prefer?read whole post | permalink06.02.2005 Bob LeveyI sat right between The Boys, when our hair was dark and blood was in the air. To my left, Bob Woodward -- intense, methodical, precise, ambitious. To my right, Carl Bernstein -- who never met a moment he didn\u0027t enjoy, a woman he didn\u0027t try to enjoy or a situation he didn\u0027t try to charm his way through. I divide them as follows: I once asked Bob for five bucks. He lent me ten. Carl once asked me for five bucks. He owes it to me still. Of course, they belong to the ages now, thanks in large part to Redford, Hoffman and that delusional wonder, Richard Nixon...read whole post | permalink | comments06.02.2005 Madeline Janis-AparicioThe living wage idea is about empowering the working poor and providing a wage that allows them to be self-reliant and not dependent on government assistance programs. The law has now affected nearly 10,000 workers in the city of Los Angeles. Contrary to the fear-mongering of doomsayers, Los Angeles did not turn into a rustbelt tragedy of fleeing businesses and mass unemployment. In fact, just the opposite has occurred.read whole post | permalink | comments06.02.2005 Bree WalkerIf there is any momentum building toward a legitimate revolt in the blogosphere, it must necesssarily include a seroius look at how we worship celebrity. Oprah as God, Paris Hilton as sex goddess, Michael Jackson as a martyr to persecution -- no wonder we have given new meaning around the world to the phrase \"Ugly American\". I write these words with a renewed sense of my own vulnerability as a very minor celebrity with a small but inescapable disability.read whole post | permalink06.02.2005 Jerry and Joe LongA few random thoughts while trying to figure out how it is that Al Qaeda can even have websites?

There are still more racial murders that scream for redress. Mack Charles Parker, Herbert Lee, and Jimmy Lee Jackson, to name three of the more blatant cases, were victims of racially motivated violence. No state or federal charges were ever brought against their murderers. Some of their suspected killers may still be alive.read whole post | permalink | comments06.02.2005 James BoyceIt\u0027s time for Democrats to carpe their manhood and start hitting Dick Cheney on his claim that the Iraqi insurgency is in its \"last throes.\" (Did any prominent Democrat cry bullshit on this?

I couldn’t, and when I ask her, she smiles slightly and just shakes her head. I talk to five separate women about how they came to be living in the IDP camps, and the differences are mostly in the details. “We woke up... the men came on camels with guns at 1 a.m.... 4 a.m.... 5 a.m.”read whole post | permalink | commentsWatch The Video","h1":"China\u0027s Military Growing As Fast As Its EconomyAp·pog·gia·tu·ra",".title":"","h2":"On The Blog NowHow to (help) stop the war: Opt Your Kid OutProtecting SourcesProgressives Are Weak, and Memorial Week -- Installment #3\"He Put America First.\"The Parties Are OverSome Honest Questions for Bush Republicans From a Liberal PussyFighting for KidsA King-Sized Week, Pt 3Whipped Colorful Dogs Stuck in NeutralThe Iranian ElectionsThe Next Watergate: It Won\u0027t Happen Without \u0027Big Journalism\u0027Apocalypse NOTCelebrity Acquittal RiddleOde To DickWhy The Till Case Still MattersOpportunity Knocking For All Democrats: Cheney and Republicans in Their Last Throes of CredibilityWitness to Darfur (Part 4)","h3":"BlogsBreaking NewsU.S. NewspapersInternational NewspapersNational News NetworkInternational News NetworksNews Search Engines",".snippet":"","h4":"Limbaugh: \u0027Dem Voters Don\u0027t Work Anyway\u0027 ...
