{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Novelist, Screenwriter, and Associate Professor at Columbia UniversityFrom 12 to 50 it\u0027s assumed we\u0027re packing, assumed that like the Hulk or zombies we possess superhuman, virtually unstoppable destructive power. So where an average citizen may disagree, even argue and berate a police officer, treating them as the public servant that they indeed are, a black man, if he wishes to continue living, must channel his ancestors. His slave ancestors. Today, in a world of black presidents, electric cars and talking iPhones, it\u0027s so hard to convince young black men, like my 13-year-old son, that if a police officer merely perceives you are a lethal threat, he may shoot you dead. So what I have to drill into him, since I want him to continue to live, is to listen to his Guardian Slave and be preternaturally polite and respectful no matter how ugly and unreasonable the policeman\u0027s demand. Then at least he\u0027ll probably only be tased.This is a strange year, even an awful one, to celebrate Thanksgiving. A grand jury\u0027s refusal to indict Ferguson, Missouri police officer Darren Wilson has crystallized ugly truths indeed.Professor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027We are in a state of emergency, a time of challenge and controversy, but not because of the protestors. That state of emergency will continue until we stand, become uncomfortable, and demand a justice system that addresses the manifestation of pain in protest, the further chipping away of respect, and the real state of emergency our country faces.Director of African American Religious Affairs, People For the American Way and People For the American Way FoundationAs we sit around our holiday table, we can celebrate the manifold opportunities to teach our parents, children, grandchildren and guests that it would be a terrible waste of life if all we focused on was our own personal blessings without simultaneously raising to consciousness all that needs \u0027tikkun.\u0027Editor, Tikkun MagazineWe now all have the chance to examine the evidence -- released last night -- in the grand jury\u0027s decision not to indict white police officer Darren Wilson, who fired multiple bullets into Michael Brown. But the verdict on America\u0027s criminal justice system is already in for many Americans: guilty, for treating young black men differently than young white men.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersMy husband always has the option of changing careers. My son can never change who he is. But my son and other black boys need allies in uniform to protect him. Allies like his father.News Reporter \u0026 BloggerI don\u0027t think the fate of Darren Wilson as a human being really means anything to the ruling class. At the end of the day, people like Bob McCulloch aren\u0027t protecting Wilson so much as the system that he stood for.Author, \u0027Tear Down This Myth\u0027This is consistent with the cultural logic that makes it okay in America to use brutal force when confronted by a Black villain. Thus, how can a grand jury indict Officer Darren Wilson when he was battling The Hulk?Author, \u0027Black Queer Identity Matrix\u0027 and \u0027Black Comics: Politics of Race and Representation\u0027; professor of communication studies, Rider UniversityEven if the federal government declines to prosecute Wilson, it is highly probable that the Justice Department under a 1994 federal law will take the Ferguson police department to federal court itself. Once there, upon a showing of a pattern of civil rights violations, they can force reforms under consent decrees with federal monitors.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityI can\u0027t speak. My country has scarred me once again. How can I go to work in the morning on a train full of people who care not? At a workplace of people who missed the story because of football or reality television?University Chaplain, University of PennsylvaniaInstead of greater freedom over our work and family lives, \"flexibility\" now often means that workers need to come in whenever the employer wants them and are sent home when demand is slack. Employers have adopted the language of \"flexibility\" but rebranded its meaning.Distinguished University Professor in the sociology department, University of Massachusetts AmherstProfessor of Sociology, University of Massachusetts AmherstI am very fond of my little dolls which are \"mini-me\u0027s\" and have a very special and dear meaning to me. But I like to look at my Father\u0027s works for what they are: Picasso\u0027s work and I am in awe of so many things he created.Culture Columnist, Huffington Post, CultureZohnThrough daily moral consciousness we must all counter the proliferating voices of racial and ethnic and religious division that are regaining too much respectability over the land.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe workers covered by the president\u0027s orders already have paid a price, however. They know that any day, their families may be torn apart. They work hard and pay taxes but the risk of being caught and deported keeps them on the fringes of society.President, Common CauseEstimates vary, but somewhere between 10 and 16 million Americans are defrauded each year in this way. Thanksgiving can be an awkward time of year for some victims, since family members account for more than 30 percent of the identity thieves.Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911Cooking is one of my favorite pastimes, but cooking a big meal without a plan can take time away from family and friends and add stress to the season. Most of us would rather watch the Bears play the Lions from the couch, not from the kitchen. With that in mind, here are a few tips for removing stress from Thanksgiving and adding more time to focus on family.Former WNBA MVP, four-time Olympic Gold MedalistBesides giving us insights, surveys and findings, can more social scientists like these few but important examples change some routines to provide strategies, tactics, and solutions that can more practically flow from their knowledge to action?Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorThanksgiving is all about giving thanks, and being grateful and kind is not something we should restrict to this time of year. It\u0027s a gift that keeps on giving all year long -- not just for those we interact with, but for ourselves as well.AuthorI have a neuromuscular autoimmune disease called myasthenia gravis. Like other friends of mine with MG, lupus, multiple sclerosis, and other illnesses, I have to weigh the joys of being with loved ones against the risks of getting a cold or the flu, which can lead to relapses, hospitalization, and weeks (or months) bedridden.Writer, speaker, lipstick lover.

Blogs at www.jessicagimeno.comOn Nov. 18, in Kiev, philanthropist Victor Pinchuk was awarded the Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky Medal of Honor by the Jewish Confederation of Ukraine for his contributions to Ukrainian-Jewish understanding and cooperation. What follows is a version of my remarks at the ceremony.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.I don\u0027t believe that girls are turned off by STEM because it\u0027s hard or simply because girls think they\u0027re bad at math. Girls aren\u0027t wimps or wilting flowers; they don\u0027t shrink from challenges just because something isn\u0027t a strength.

As long as the bankers\u0027 culture of corruption goes unpunished, the safety of the global economy -- and of individual families\u0027 well-being -- remains at risk.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourAs you feel the dry, rough skin of your father\u0027s hand, or perhaps the pudgy, sticky fingers of your nephew in the palm of your own, you may find yourself feeling both uncomfortable and comforted.
