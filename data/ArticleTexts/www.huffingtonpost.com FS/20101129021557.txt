{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week\u0027s arrest of a Somali-born U.S. citizen as he attempted to detonate a car bomb during a Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Oregon was a chilling reminder that national security begins at home. It\u0027s one more reason why bringing our troops home from Afghanistan quickly needs to be more than \"aspirational\" (as the Pentagon recently termed the goal of being out by 2014). It\u0027s not just the at least $413 billion we\u0027ll spend between now and then trying to manage an unwinnable civil war (though it would certainly help with some much needed nation-building here at home). It\u0027s that every week -- from Yemen to North Korea to the Senate\u0027s likely refusal to ratify the new START treaty -- we are reminded of the many dangers to our national security emanating from all around the world, and including our own soil. The opportunity cost of remaining in Afghanistan is growing every day.Read Post | CommentsAri Emanuel, 11.21.2010CEO, William Morris Endeavor EntertainmentLike Truman, Obama will not be fully appreciated until he is out of office.

But that couldn\u0027t be true, could it?Read Post | CommentsArianna Huffington, 11.24.2010At a tech conference I attended recently in Abu Dhabi, I gave a talk about how to use social media to promote peace in the Middle East.

Dennis Kucinich, 11.23.2010U.S. House RepresentativeIt\u0027s truly amazing that our government said we were negotiating with a high-level Taliban leader (who, we just learned, was an impostor) even as we were stepping up air strikes to wipe them out.Read Post | CommentsLee Camp, 11.21.2010Comedian commentator featured on ABC, PBS, Comedy Central, Al Jazeera \u0026 Showtime; www.LeeCamp.netIt has come to light that some scenes were cut because they did not portray the Palins in a manner congruent with their image or brand.
