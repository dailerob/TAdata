{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"LONDON - I am delighted to be in London today for the first Huffington Post launch outside of North America: Welcome to HuffPost UK. Britain has always held a very special place in my heart, having gone to college and started my career here. Indeed, my time in the UK set the course for the rest of my life -- leading all the way, in fact, to the creation of The Huffington Post in May of 2005. We are arriving here in the midst of a rich and thriving media culture marked by great innovation. We look forward to adding HuffPost UK to the mix, and to our real-time \u0027digital water cooler\u0027 -- which embraces the best of the new (immediacy, transparency, interactivity) and the best of the old (fact-checking, accuracy, fairness, and an emphasis on storytelling) -- becoming the spark for many interesting conversations. So check out HuffPost UK and let us know what you think.Read Post | CommentsJason Linkins, 07/6/11 02:09 PM ETEditor, Eat the PressNow that Michele Bachmann is out on the stump and breaking upwards in most polls, it seems to be time to start putting her personal life through the media churn.Read Post | CommentsBob Cesca, 07/6/11 02:29 PM ETProducer, Editor of BobCesca.comIn the last six or seven months alone, there are enough examples of Republicans botching very basic ideas and facts to fill stacks of \"Bushism\" style novelty calendars.Read Post | CommentsEve Ensler, 07/6/11 04:36 PM ETAuthor of \u0027I Am An Emotional Creature\" and \"The Vagina Monologues,\" Founder of V-DayThe Strauss-Kahn case is not about winning or losing, but opening a dialogue on rape, violence and gender.Read Post | CommentsAmb.
