{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This is truly a Latino moment. Latino Americans -- 50 million strong and counting -- are both the largest and the fastest-growing minority in the country. They played a decisive role in the 2008 election, making the difference for Obama in Florida, Colorado, and New Mexico. They represent close to a trillion dollars of buying power. And with 32 million Hispanics online, they are among the most wired and connected groups in the country. So I\u0027m delighted to announce the launch of HuffPost LatinoVoices. These are really challenging times for millions of Latinos. But as I said when I recently spoke at La Raza\u0027s conference in Washington, as an immigrant to this country I know that the immigrant spirit and resilience that are at the heart of the American experience can help us overcome whatever obstacles lie ahead and truly move mountains.Read Post | CommentsAlec Baldwin, 8/11/11ActorAm I running for mayor?

Hilda Solis, 8/10/11U.S. Secretary of LaborAs the country\u0027s first Latina Labor Secretary, I appreciate both how far our community has come and how far we still have to go. Latinos come from a heritage of hard work, but our great work ethic will only flourish if we have the qualifications for job openings where we can apply it.Read Post | CommentsStaceyann Chin, 8/11/11Author, \u0027The Other Side of Paradise\u0027One day I looked up from the jaded wreckage of my umpteenth breakup and was deafened by the horror of my ticking biological clock.
