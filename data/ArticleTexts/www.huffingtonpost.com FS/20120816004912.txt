{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Assoc. Professor, Univ. of Missouri, Kansas City; Sr. regulator during S\u0026L debacleOne of Governor Romney\u0027s criticisms of President Obama is that he \"takes his political inspiration from Europe...\" Romney never gives specifics on this criticism.

Al Sharpton, 08/15/12President, National Action NetworkIn Pennsylvania, a judge has ruled in favor of upholding the draconian Republican-supported voter ID law.
