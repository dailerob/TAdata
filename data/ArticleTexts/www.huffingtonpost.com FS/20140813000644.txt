{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Author and former head of communications to Tony BlairWe live in a celebrity culture, like it or not. It means that around the world in coming days, people will be talking about this terrible event, reflecting not just on Robin Williams\u0027 career, but on the reality of the illness which led him to his death. He will forever be remembered for his acting and comedic skills, and the films are there for all time for future generation to enjoy. But I hope too that he will be remembered as someone whose death was another staging post in the changing attitudes to mental health and mental illness which are desperately required all around the world.The disturbing nature of the frequency of recent news reports in which unarmed Black men have been killed by law enforcement officers is only exceeded by this fact: the act itself is deeply embedded into the racial fabric of our nation.Author, \u0027FREESTYLE: Reflections on Faith, Family, Justice, and Pop Culture\u0027; Founding Pastor, Joy Tabernacle A.M.E. Church, Dallas, TexasEven though I didn\u0027t know Robin Williams, I\u0027m affected by his suicide. It feels like we all are. We all feel so goddamn sad.

Although Sisi\u0027s road to perdition may be a long one, the HRW report will ensure that the Egyptian leader will be haunted by the ghosts of his victims at Rabaa. Editor, Middle East EyeThe call for change was loud. But, it was lost on me because I had heard this all before. I had seen online and heard in conversations the focus shift away from Michael Brown to the ills of black St. Louis. I wanted to know about Michael Brown.Doctoral candidate in American studies, Saint Louis UniversityHas America\u0027s moral arc bent toward justice over the last half century? By some measures, it appears not.Actor, \u0027M*A*S*H\u0027 and \u0027Providence\u0027Mr. Williams\u0027s electric presence, comic genius and comforting fallibility made him not only a great actor, but, perhaps, an emotional bridge from which the Millennials and their parents, the Boomers, could come together, better aware of their collective imperfections and differences.Senior/International Blog Editor, The Huffington PostThe negative perceptions of blacks, especially black males, by much of the public are not the only problem in effecting effective legal measures against police violence. There is no ironclad standard of what is or isn\u0027t an acceptable use of force in police misconduct cases.Author and political analystToday, I remember and appreciate an actor whose talents filled the wounds in peoples lives through his talent, his gentleness and his ability to make people laugh.Oglala Lakota Sioux | Writer | Advocate | UPenn AlumThe systematic and widespread killing of at least 1,150 demonstrators by Egyptian security forces in July and August 2013 probably amounts to crimes against humanity, Human Rights Watch said today in a report based on a year-long investigation.Defending human rights world wideEven though I had not spoken with Robin in a very long time, I always assumed there would be some future opportunity to tell him that his letter changed my life. It taught me that you stand up for the things that matter. And even if your attempts fail, you tried. You told the truth. You took care of your friends. You fought back.Author, former child actorThe international community is failing to recognize that ISIS is an international -- not just Iraqi -- problem, as a hotbed of terrorism makes roots in such a vital area.Egyptian Copt; President, Board of Coptic SolidarityAs we take in the tragedy of Robin Williams\u0027 passing, we should also reject the shambles that is mental health care for most Americans. If there is an \"if only\" that makes sense, it is a societal one.Professor Emerita, USC Marshall School; Author, \u0027The Secret Handshake\u0027 and \u0027Shadow Campus\u0027The claims put forward by advocates of Common Core and its attendant standardized testing regime are just not true, at least according to the latest research on how the human brain operates and how people learn.Social studies educator, Hofstra UniversityHealing from self-blame for wrong done to you is possible, especially through a compassionate connection. I have hardly ever seen this demonstrated as well as in the film Good Will Hunting, starring Robin Williams and Matt Damon.Professor of Theology, Chicago Theological SeminaryIt is not fair. It is not even rational. It just is. But death and depression are not who anyone is. They are nothing more or less than accomplices, the low-rent architects of your self-destruction and despair.WriterFor the last eight years, Israel and the U.S. had repeated opportunities to opt for a diplomatic solution in Gaza. Each time, they have chosen war, with devastating consequences for the families of Gaza.Author of \"The Lemon Tree: An Arab, a Jew, and the Heart of the Middle East.\"The trouble with suicide is that no one knows what to say. No one knows how to react. So they smile and wave and attempt distraction... but they never ever say the word. The survivors, it seems, are often left to survive on their own.Child and Adolescent Psychotherapist, Parenting ExpertNegative caricatures of aging are far too prevalent in our culture -- and they are harmful. Simply telling people to think positively about aging doesn\u0027t work, because the mind is very good at thwarting such explicit lessons. There may, however, be a more subtle way to mitigate the deleterious effects of such caricatures.Author, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027Being a teenager today is not easy. As schools open throughout the country during August and September, teens are dealing with more than the normal stress that we dealt with before technology.Author and Parent and Family Internet AdvocateI had the great opportunity to share a meal with Robin Williams.

But even though an estimated 13 million Americans have become newly insured since the first of this year, the predictions of the gloom-and-doomers have not panned out.Author, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgMy message to Democrats is: Dump your corporate consultants. Just campaign for the necessities of the people. And publicize those Republican votes crisply, widely and repeatedly.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorI\u0027ve lost count of how many times I\u0027ve heard, \"I could never do what you do,\" but I think that\u0027s only because people don\u0027t know what they are missing out on.women\u0027s fiction author www.gretedeangelo.comUkraine. Gaza. Syria. Yemen. Pakistan. If it feels like the United States is always at war somewhere, that\u0027s because it is. Not just Iraq and Afghanistan - the two wars we all know about. Why?
