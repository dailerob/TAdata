{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"I\u0027m delighted to announce the launch of HuffPost Alberta and HuffPost British Columbia, which will bring HuffPost\u0027s signature mix of news, blogging, community, and social engagement to these western provinces. From Alberta and British Columbia\u0027s vast energy industry and environmentalist traditions to First Nations lands and the Northern Gateway pipeline, these new Canadian editions will tell the stories that need to be told -- and, just as importantly, help those in Alberta and British Columbia tell their stories themselves. As the HuffPost family grows -- it was just last month that we welcomed HuffPost Canada Impact -- we can\u0027t wait to see how these new editions will start conversations around the stories that get to the heart of each province\u0027s identity, and those that will decide their future.Read Post | Comments (19)Norman Lear, 08/16/12Founder, People for the American WayAm I crazy to suspect that Paul Ryan\u0027s \"God not government\" usage is less an homage to Thomas Jefferson or John Locke than it is a rhetorical boost for the right-wing project to claim a divine mandate for the Tea Party\u0027s radically restricted view of the role of government?Read Post | Comments (394)Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm, 08/16/12Former governor of Michigan; Host, \u0027The War Room\u0027 on Current TV; columnist, Politico; faculty member, UC BerkeleyIf you\u0027re staying at home because you\u0027re disgusted by the negative tone of the campaign; or you believe both sides run the same vile, lying, attack ads; or because you\u0027re turned off by politics: Congratulations, you are fulfilling someone else\u0027s agenda. You are following their plan to the letter.Read Post | Comments (1,109)Robert L. Borosage, 08/16/12President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureIt\u0027s unclear what effect Romney\u0027s decision to add Rep. Paul Ryan to his ticket will have on his candidacy, if any. But the choice certainly has had a salutary effect on the Obama re-election campaign.Read Post | Comments (310)Jon Soltz, 08/16/12Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranI think back to Romney, in 2007, saying it wasn\u0027t \"worth moving heaven and earth\" to get Osama bin Laden, and the Iraq veteran in me thanks God he wasn\u0027t president these past few years. If Romney was president, bin Laden may very well be alive today.Read Post | Comments (138)Joe Sestak, 08/16/12Dad; Former Congressman; 3 Star Admiral; Director, Defense Policy, Director, Navy Anti-TerrorismThe failure to prevent the millions of troubled mortgages from becoming delinquent and being foreclosed causes damage not only to individual borrowers who lose their homes, but also to their communities and to the economy as a whole.Read Post | Comments (96)Jill Blakeway, 08/16/12Acupuncturist, Herbalist And AuthorI\u0027ve talked with thousands of people about their sex lives. I\u0027ve heard over and over about how much sex people are not having, how they just don\u0027t feel like it, how they are too tired to think about it. I\u0027m always happy to be able to tell them there are simple solutions available.Read Post | Comments (72)Heidi Grant Halvorson, Ph.D., 08/16/12Motivational psychologist and author, \u0027Succeed\u0027 and \"Nine Things Successful People Do Differently\"Why can\u0027t we make the happiness last? Psychologists (and renown happiness experts) Kennon Sheldon and Sonja Lyubomirsky argue in a recent paper that our hedonic adaption occurs for two reasons.Read Post | Comments (13)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 08/16/12Author, research psychologist, and gender expertThere is little doubt -- particularly in the current climate -- that gender-specific coverage and attacks will remain a factor in political races. The question is whether being a woman running for office is something that the country needs and fairness demands.Read Post | CommentsCarolyn Maloney, 08/15/12U.S. Representative from New YorkWe can all agree that there are hard choices to be made. But Mr. Ryan\u0027s way is not the right way. His \"hard choices\" are hard on women, hard on children, hard on the middle class, and hard on the disadvantaged.Read Post | Comments (304)Bill Moyers, 08/16/12Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyRecently I\u0027ve been coming across messages from some of you who say you just want to give up -- there\u0027s so much going wrong in America and the world you feel overwhelmed and helpless. So I wanted to meet you here for a moment, face to face -- so to speak -- with a simple three-word response: get over it.Read Post | CommentsJohn Kinnear, 08/16/12Father and part-time \u0027daddy blogger\u0027My little girl turns 2 next week. I write that sentence, and yet it still feels unreal -- from both directions. I can\u0027t believe two years have disappeared and, at the same time, I feel like she\u0027s been a part of our lives for much, much longer than that.Read Post | Comments (25)Paul Brandeis Raushenbush, 08/16/12Senior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostFor a Christian like me, the question that the Pussy Riot action begs is where might Jesus stand in the controversy between the combined power of the Church and State vs. three girls who made a prayer for deliverance from it.Read Post | Comments (76)Peter Van Buren, 08/16/12Fmr. State Department Iraq PRT leader; Author, \u0027We Meant Well\u0027Strange that when I do media interviews now, only two years later, nobody even thinks to ask \"Did we succeed in Iraq?\" or \"Will reconstruction pay off?\" The question du jour has finally shifted to: \"Why did we fail?\"Read Post | Comments (45)Michelangelo Signorile, 08/16/12Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesThere are unconfirmed reports that the alleged shooter was angry with the Family Research Council\u0027s position on same-sex marriage, and that he made comments against the group\u0027s position as he attempted to enter. If true, this would be an anomaly.Read Post | Comments (268)Mohamed A. El-Erian, 08/15/12CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOPaul Ryan may be too hasty in dismissing the extent to which the new normal is becoming embedded in our economy and, with each passing week, transitioning from a short-term exception into an even more painful multi-year reality.Read Post | Comments (380)Rep. Gwen Moore, 08/16/12U.S. Representative for Wisconsin\u0027s 4th Congressional DistrictAs with other provisions in VAWA, the SaVE Act is another commonsense protection that is mired in partisan politics. What Republicans have refused to understand is that sexual violence, dating violence and stalking transcend political lines.Read Post | CommentsLawrence Korb, 08/16/12Senior Fellow, Center for American ProgressEven those who believe that modernization is more important to the Air Force than any other pressing issues should be encouraged by the actual budget data. The Air Force is not locked in a \"downward spiral\" but is dealing, like the rest of our military, with a drawdown from war and a tight fiscal situation.Read Post | Commentsdanah boyd, 08/16/12Senior researcher, Microsoft Research; Research Assistant Professor, New York UniversityFar too often, the exploitation that is occurring is a result of social and structural conditions that we\u0027ve created as a society. Collapsing choice, circumstance, and coercion into one category of sex work or trafficking erodes the nuances that explain people\u0027s engagement with sex for money.Read Post | CommentsJustin Moss, 08/15/12Director of Broward Operations, Florida Grand OperaToday\u0027s opera stars, men and women alike, must have the whole package. They need to be as convincing in their appearance as they are in their singing.Read Post | CommentsRobert Hughes, Jr., 08/16/12Professor of Human Development, University of Illinois at Urbana-ChampaignShould you live with your future spouse before tying the knot? Does cohabitation provide a good trial run for marriage or is it just a sign of a lack of commitment?Read Post | Comments (32)Van Jones, 08/16/12President, RebuildtheDream.com; Author of NY Times bestseller, \u0027The Green-Collar Economy\u0027Housing and foreclosures have been largely absent from the political debate, but they\u0027re about to break through in a big way. Battleground states like Nevada, Florida, Ohio, Colorado, Wisconsin, and North Carolina have been among the hardest hit by the housing crisis.Read Post | Comments (18)Marlo Thomas, 08/15/12Award-winning actress, author, and activistA secretary-turned-copywriter-turned author, Helen rocked the culture with her revolutionary ideas about women and sexuality -- and she did so without fear or apology.Read Post | Comments (122)Catherine New, 08/16/12Reporter and writerSome men bring women flowers on a first date. I bring my dates lottery tickets. What better way to potentiate a lifetime of romance and wonderment than by winning $80 million, or more, together?Read Post | CommentsBonnie Kavoussi, 08/16/12Economics Reporter, The Huffington PostThe lottery is ruining your life. Whether you buy lottery tickets once a day or once a year, the lottery is destroying you because it is insidiously convincing you that the only way you can succeed in life is through luck instead of skill.Read Post | CommentsRichard (RJ) Eskow, 08/16/12Writer; host, \u0027The Breakdown\u0027; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureNot only has the Republican Party shown that its most intransigent wing is now in the ascendancy, making a post-election deal unlikely, but the Ryan nomination makes it easier to draw a clear distinction between the parties on Social Security and Medicare.Read Post | Comments (195)Andree Lau, 2012.17.08Dr. David J.
