{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week\u0027s headlines were dominated by the Arab Spring turning to Arab Fall in Egypt, as clashes between Muslim Brotherhood supporters and government forces claimed over 600 lives. Not getting a fraction of the media attention was the continuing violence in Iraq, where more than 1,000 have been killed since July, including 33 on Thursday alone. More than 10 years after it began, and 20 months since U.S. withdrawal, the Iraq War continues to be a disaster of epic proportions, with a seemingly limitless supply of unintended consequences. Reports note that U.S. efforts are now focused on making sure Iraq\u0027s Shiite government doesn\u0027t get too close to Iran\u0027s Shiite government, which is sending weapons to Syria, whose conflict is destabilizing key U.S. ally Jordan. And yet the war\u0027s catastrophic impact remains inversely related to our desire to reckon with how it happened. Case in point: the prominence still afforded those who beat the drums of war the loudest.Comments (111)Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOWith political will, America has the ability to promote high and inclusive economic growth, create sustainable jobs, enhance productive opportunities for its citizens, improve public services, and arrest the type of inequality that silently eats away at social integrity and cohesion.Comments (313)Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoThe American judiciary exists, first and foremost, to protect the constitutional rights of those who are not in the majority. It exists to ensure that our government treats all of us with respect.Comments (928)Arianna HuffingtonThe future will definitely be a hybrid one, combining the best practices of traditional journalism with the best tools available to the digital world. Jeff Bezos has already changed the definition of what retail is; our definition of what constitutes news could use the same level of rethinking.Comments (110)Kirk DouglasActorI sat in the driver\u0027s seat and I saw a note on the wheel. I recognized Michael\u0027s handwriting: \"Dad, you always say I never asked you for anything but you gave me a lot. Love, Michael.\" What is the opposite of rejection? Acceptance.Comments (136)Sen. Bernie Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth WarrenThe next Fed chair will have an opportunity to get our economy back on track and to help rebuild America\u0027s middle class. But that will require the right temperament and a willingness to take on Wall Street CEOs when necessary.Comments (1,023)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarA new study from the London School of Economics found that an increasing number of younger women are choosing to have children earlier, with the idea that they\u0027ll return to, or even start, their careers later on.Comments (483)Nathan MyhrvoldFormer CTO, MicrosoftUnfortunately, there\u0027s no magic approach to separate the bad crazy ideas from the good crazy ideas, but the good ones do have a few distinguishing characteristics that help us improve our success rate.Comments (97)Tracy McMillanAuthor, TV writerEvery good thing you can imagine happening in the world -- from the eradication of hunger to the end of Citizens United -- will happen sooner if each one of us takes responsibility for ourselves, and from there, reaches out to serve others.Comments (425)Doug BandowSenior Fellow, the Cato InstituteToo bad the hundreds shot dead on Cairo streets won\u0027t be able to vote in the new restored democracy. Washington needs to \"reset\" relations with Egypt.Comments (424)Keli GoffAuthor and Special Correspondent, TheRoot.comIf women are looking to achieve anything close to the myth known as \"having it all,\" the more children they have, the harder it will be. That\u0027s not judgment. That\u0027s simple math.Comments (653)Kal PennActor/ProducerIt was a mistake to try to casually engage in 140 characters with folks who I thought understood my background and beliefs; instead, folks misunderstood this as a strong advocation of something entirely different. I feel terrible about that and am sorry.Comments (176)Iris HigginsCertified hypnotherapist, past life regression specialist, and women\u0027s health coachI\u0027m sorry because every time you ate something you \"shouldn\u0027t\" or ate more than you \"should,\" I talked about \"getting back on the bandwagon.\" I cringe now every time someone uses that phrase. When did the way we eat become a bandwagon? When did everyone stop eating and become professional dieters?Comments (442)Russell SimmonsFounder, GlobalGrind.comThe time has come to end the so-called \"War on Drugs.\" Forty years of a failed war has destroyed communities and families all across our land. Hard earned tax-payer dollars have been wasted on ineffective policies that have resulted in over-incarceration.Comments (402)Katie HurleyChild and Adolescent Psychotherapist, Parenting ExpertLife is far too scripted today. Plans are made. Classes are attended. Craft projects are intended to mimic those found on Pinterest. Gone are the days of free play and creating something out of nothing. Many kids today are simply following a script.Comments (242)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Comments (1,740)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundOur children are afraid for their friends, their families, and themselves. They know something needs to change. But they can\u0027t get there without us -- and they certainly can\u0027t get there by arming themselves with still more guns.Comments (175)Adam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; founder of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911For Americans concerned about their privacy, the NSA data grabs are daunting, but what about the data grabs happening inside your own home, perpetrated not by the government but by your coffee machine?Comments (400)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistAt first, Internet dating sites carried a stigma; they were perceived as ground zero for socially awkward and desperately hopeless souls who could not find love in the \"real world.\" All of that changed, however, as online technology became more sophisticated, and cupid-driven algorithms pushed matchmaking light years beyond the old \"What\u0027s your sign?\" formula.Comments (31)Jonathan WeilerDirector of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel HillCan we please stop talking as if the phrase \"Republican moderate\" has any basis in political reality? Nationally, the GOP has become a party of radicals, proudly wearing on its sleeve its contempt for the less well off and its ignorance of basic scientific reality.Comments (1,461)Cherie BlairFounder, Cherie Blair Foundation for WomenEliminating discrimination against women is a strategy that will move global development progress forward. We will fail to achieve lasting positive change if women are excluded.Comments (142)Rob BrooksEvolutionary biologist and authorNews just in, guaranteed to stir smug nods from non-believers and incite irritation among the devout: intelligence correlates negatively with religious belief.Comments (2,268)Sarah Hankel-HoffmanWife and straight allyIt is our lifetime conviction that all people are created equal, and it is our belief that good people subscribe to the \"golden rule\" that has resulted in our decision to withdraw our reservation to hold our wedding reception at the Görtz Haus Gallery in Grimes, Iowa, on Sept. 7, 2013.Comments (824)Leo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersLast month, McDonald\u0027s gave its workers a little gift -- a budget purporting to show how to survive on the starvation wages the burger behemoth pays. The bizarre financial plan made millionaire McDonald\u0027s CEO Don Thompson look like a real clown.Comments (759)Ann BrenoffSenior Writer, The Huffington PostWe are now living with an entire generation of disinterested store clerks, rude waiters, indifferent cable company operators and medical office staffs who frankly don\u0027t give a damn whether you ever cross their employer\u0027s doorway again. Does Best Buy really wonder why it\u0027s in bankruptcy? (Hint: Shoppers hate you.)Comments (1,314)Mike RyanSenior Entertainment Writer, The Huffington PostJim Carrey was probably right to denounce \"Kick-Ass 2.\"Comments (399)The Daily MealTheDailyMeal.comThere is no doubt that the classic college bar is a major part of an undergrad\u0027s life. Everyone\u0027s got their favorite campus late-night hangout. But some of these college bars, from universities and colleges big and small, truly define what it means to be a (insert your college mascot here).Comments (15)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkParents and grandparents in this city are tired of having to warn their children about both criminals and the police. Do we want to see crime reduced? Absolutely, because they are doing it to us. But don\u0027t criminalize us at the same time.Comments (340)Soraya ChemalyFeminist, Writer, Satirist... not always in that orderIt seems logical to me that the same way I try to teach my kids to exercise, sleep well and be good people, I would teach them to have healthy sex and sleep with other good people.Comments (1,060)Eli LehrerPresident, R StreetI\u0027m a conservative and would have voted against Obamacare if I were a member of Congress. I think that many of its provisions are silly and have criticized some of them rather loudly. That said, I\u0027m likely to count myself among the winners as the revised health care system rolls out.Comments (593)Jamie McGonnigalCommunity Engagement Manager, New Organizing InstituteInstead of actually standing up for LGBT athletes, the IOC is essentially siding with Russia and issuing a warning to lesbian and gay athletes. The IOC has made it clear that they have a double standard when it comes to accepting all athletes.Comments (344)Michael Calderone, 2013.18.08Jared Bernstein, 2013.18.08Bill McKibben, 2013.18.08Susan Buchanan, 2013.18.08Kevin Grandia, 2013.18.08Lisa Arends, 2013.18.08Jabril Faraj, 2013.18.08David Shing, 2013.18.08Lisa-Jo Baker, 2013.18.08Brian Kennedy, 2013.18.08Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"BRITS DETAIN GREENWALD\u0027S PARTNER",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
