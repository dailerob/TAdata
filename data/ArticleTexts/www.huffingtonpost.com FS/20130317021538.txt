Do corporate profits from dangerous products or harmful practices trump children\u0027s security and safety in our nation? Is compromise that allows gross or some significant human injustice the best we can expect from American democracy? Isn\u0027t it time to engage in a fuller discussion about the breakdown of core values in America and the values we do agree on and need and want to instill in the next generation? What does it mean to be an American? What does it mean to be a human being?Comments (116)Greg TobinAmerican AuthorSt. Patrick is not the benign figure wearing a green bishop\u0027s miter holding a shamrock and casting the snakes from the shores of his homeland,Comments (181)Kathy Mulvany, 03.15.2013Senior Director, Cisco Corporate AffairsWhat does the term \"shared value\" mean?

He failed to do so, however, because he anticipated, correctly, that the war would divide the Democrats down the middle, and that the division would benefit the Bush administration politically.CommentsStacey KramerFounder, BrandPlayI lost a friend and colleague last spring. His diagnosis was way worse than mine. He was not so lucky.Comments (207)Paul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostWhen the now familiar face of the Cardinal from Buenos Aires appeared I found myself shouting at the screen: \"who is that?\" And soon we knew: Pope Francis, potentially the most transformative pope the church has seen in 50 years.Comments (34)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarIt\u0027s important to raise children to value honesty, and to prevent lying from becoming frequent and consistent, the point at which lying is most troublesome. The first step in figuring out how to address a lie is to consider why your child is telling it. Is the child trying to avoid trouble? Save face?Comments (19)Gary HartPresident, Hart International, Ltd.Underlying all the media focus on the cardinals\u0027 selection of a new pope, and the predictable focus on personality over meaning, was a much greater struggle between tradition and reform, conservatism and progress. That struggle mirrors politics in America and most western democracies.CommentsJohn PavleyCTO @ The Huffington Post, BloggerNaturally I turn to technology to help me out. Modern technology is awesome, but not enough. Here is my current, highly optimized, guide to personal productivity using a combination of technology, common sense, and ideas stolen (with love) from various experts and scientific studies.CommentsJohn FarrEditor, bestmoviesbyfarr.comI love St. Patrick\u0027s Day. It\u0027s so inclusive. By that I mean that though it\u0027s a bona fide religious holiday, you don\u0027t need to be particularly pious to enjoy it. Wishing everyone a safe and (reasonably) responsible holiday, I present my own candidates for the top drinking movies of all time.Comments (78)Lucia AnnunziataEditorial Director, L\u0027Huffington PostTwo exceptional people have now risen to the top of both chambers of Parliament -- and for a country whose political institutions are undergoing an especially trying moment, this is a startlingly positive outcome.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorI\u0027d been discussing the absolute non-reality of his proposal -- how the numbers don\u0027t begin to add up, the unrealistic budget cuts, the plethora of magic asterisks in the absence of actual proposals -- and the interviewer was like, \"OK... but if you\u0027re right, why is his budget front page news?\"Comments (838)Lisa BelkinSenior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, The Huffington PostAll the talk about \"leaning in\" at work, inevitably leads to the subject of leaning in at home. You can\u0027t be equal at the office unless you are equal outside of it.  Comments (55)J.W. HarveySocial Media/Event ManagerEven children in this city act first because they risk being targeted themselves. But aggression turns to hate when action supercedes rationalization, analysis, and compassion. Knowing that, we must respond to hate with what it lacks: understanding.Comments (212)Douglas C. JohnsonAssistant Professor of Psychiatry, UCSD School of MedicineWe know that suffering is amplified when we don\u0027t see it coming, when we don\u0027t have any control over it, and when it\u0027s something we\u0027ve never had to deal with before. All of which makes Stacey Kramer, and those who respond to suffering like she has, even more remarkable.CommentsArianna HuffingtonIn this week\u0027s issue, Jaweed Kaleem shines a light on how race and efforts to diversify have affected the two-million-strong Buddhist movement in the U.S., and Mallika Rao reports on how efforts to encourage mindfulness, relaxation and stress-reduction are changing the American workplace.Comments (17)Barry LevinsonAcademy Award-winning director, screenwriter and producerI spoke with Dr. R.H Flutes again, who heads up the Lying Institute of America. For those not familiar with the good doctor, he has schooled hundreds of politicians both on the local and the national level to help them refine their lying skills.Comments (176)Devon CornealLawyer, MotherI wish I had good news for you.

I was not anxious to have a baby\u0027s birthday overshadowed by a holiday. Secondly, we had planned to give our son a very Irish name, and a matching very Irish birthday would just be too much.CommentsTzipi WeissAssociate professor, LIU Post Department of Social WorkSurvivors can learn to avoid worrying about the small stuff and attend to the awe and wonder all around us. But how does this dramatic transformation happen?CommentsJohn KinnearAuthor of AskYourDadBlog.comBefore she starts quoting Faulkner and writes a fan-fiction sequel to \"The Sound and the Fury,\" I decided now would be a good time to write down some of the toddlerisms that are slowly fading away from her mind.Comments (213)Ann BrenoffSenior Writer, The Huffington PostI can honestly say I have never given two consecutive minutes of thought to what my retired life will look like -- largely because I\u0027m convinced I can\u0027t afford to have one.Comments (53)Christa VidaverExecutive Director, Dress for Success BuffaloThe opening of the Buffalo Dress For Success affiliate was a full circle moment for me. It had begun with an e-mail from Senator Gillibrand, and there she was standing with me at our opening.CommentsSen. Brian SchatzU.S. Senator from HawaiiFirst, let\u0027s accept the facts: Climate change is real. It is caused by humans. It must be confronted.

And others don\u0027t see it until they hear those terrifying words: \"I want a divorce.\"Comments (33)Jennifer SegalOnce Upon a ChefIn this traditional Irish stew, lamb is braised in a Guinness-spiked broth along with carrots, potatoes and bright green peas. Served with a crusty loaf of bread, it\u0027s the perfect hearty fare for a St. Patrick\u0027s Day feast.CommentsScott AtranAnthropologist; Author, \u0027Talking to the Enemy: Faith, Brotherhood, and the (Un)Making of Terrorists\u0027The Founding Fathers envisioned a Republic with an enlightened citizenry educated in \"all philosophical Experiments that Light into the Nature of Things ... and multiply the Conveniences or Pleasures of Life\" -- not just technical training for jobs that pay well.Comments (71)Alice CareyWriter and Style IconFor years America has viewed Ireland through a veil of fond remembrance.Comments (18)Dan TreadwayAssociate blog editor, The Huffington PostRob Portman is a good father for changing his view on this issue so that he may support the rights of his son. But the fact that he was only able to feel empathy for the plight of gay people in this country only after the issue directly affected him is definitive proof that he is an unfit politician.Comments (355)Angie Schuller Wyatt, 2013.16.03Common Ground News Service, 2013.16.03James Scarborough, 2013.16.03Lucia Annunziata, 2013.16.03Susan Buchanan, 2013.16.03Aaron Belkin, 2013.16.03Susan D.
