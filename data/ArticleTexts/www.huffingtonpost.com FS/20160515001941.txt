{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersUsing the understandable anger of economically marginalized people whose lives and families are falling apart to hatefully blame “others” who are not the ones responsible for their problems — in order to take political power for oneself — has been one of the most despicable and dangerous patterns in American politics and world history. As you likely know, faith-based organizations don’t endorse candidates. So you won’t be surprised that I am not going to endorse Donald Trump — nor will I endorse his Democratic opponent. But we faith leaders will comment on the morality of this presidential campaign, the issues raised or not raised, and the morality of candidates based on our moral values. That’s what we “values voters” do.If the goal was to create a truly democratic representative system of governance in both Iraq and Syria than the voices of the leadership of Christian and other minority communities should have been taken into account.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027As a child, I hated not being allowed into the segregated library in my hometown. But I am honored and grateful that today the Marlboro County Public Library -- the Marian Wright Edelman Library in Bennettsville, SC -- provides a panoply of early childhood and adult literacy programs.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe ice caps will melt. Big deal, we already knew that. But have you ever thought of the stuff trapped in that ice that\u0027s going to thaw? What if some of that stuff isn\u0027t really dead, just dormant, waiting to come back? Sounds like fiction, but it\u0027s not.Scientist, Photographer, and WriterThe plain-spoken, public-spirited former Federal Communications Commissioner, Michael Copps, is indignant -- and for good reason: The FCC is not enforcing the law requiring the \"dark money\" super PACs and other campaign cash conduits to reveal, on-the-air, the names of the real donors behind all political advertisements.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorIf managers want their best people to stay, they need to think carefully about how they treat them. While good employees are as tough as nails, their talent gives them an abundance of options. Managers need to make people want to work for them.Author of #1 bestselling book, Emotional Intelligence 2.0, and president of TalentSmart, world\u0027s leading provider of emotional intelligence.Nothing satisfies the sweet tooth better than a perfect little cookie (or three).

The Iraqi Christian community has been devastated. Syria\u0027s civil war loosed the murderous Islamic State on Christians and others. Libya\u0027s disintegration opened the nation to IS fighters bent on killing anyone of the wrong faith.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteMy gut told me I needed to go and hear for myself the false rhetoric aimed at my transgender community and at me. I wanted to see if they truly believed the hate speech and if they would say it to my face.Transgender advocate, author, educator and consultantHow interested is NRA in saving lives? The answer is, I guess they\u0027re not. How interested is the NRA in selling guns no matter what the cost in human lives?Freelance writer, communications facilitator using improv comedy techniques, lost a niece to gun violence..Would all of these LGBT-related laws and lawsuits have transpired if more empathy and care were directed toward the social conservatives who were shocked and shaken by the gay marriage ruling? Probably.Founder, Capital D Strategies; Brand \u0026 Messaging Strategist; Digital Experience LeaderNakba day is a significant day for the Palestinian people.

Below are some simple tricks to help stop the clock.Internationally-recognized nutritionist; International Speaker; Adjunct professor of nutrition at NYU; Author, \u0027The Portion Teller Plan\u0027It just happens that you outgrow each other. It\u0027s not a big deal. But that doesn\u0027t mean you should stop seeing each other or that you should declare to the world that the friendship is over.Author of Massive Life Success and founder of Procrastinate ZeroIf Sanders doesn\u0027t bow out, then he at least needs to tone down his rhetoric against Clinton. Donald Trump himself is impressed by the Senator\u0027s heated rhetoric. He even plans to use some of Sanders\u0027 statements against Clinton should she secure the nomination in a general election.Multimedia Journalist/NBC Sports Game Logger/Emerson College GradI am old enough to remember when there was no Amnesty International.

But there are times when social media can truly be a beautiful thing. Social media can keep us in the know, it can help us network. And for me, social media saved my life.Youtuber, Writer, Cancer Survivor, Outspeak Contributor, Activist and Beer EnthusiastThe recent spike in the use of heroin and other opioids, sparking frightening headlines about addiction and overdose, has left families struggling to find solutions.The full spectrum of human relationships with drugsThis week we heard that the gun George Zimmerman used to kill Trayvon Martin was being placed up for auction, with an opening bid of $5000. It\u0027s sickening.Founder of The Simple Way, co-director of Red Letter ChristiansThe prototypical Trump backer is a poorly educated, slob of a blue collar white male worker or farmer in the backwoods of the Deep South or Midwest who alternately fears and loathes Blacks, Hispanics, gays, liberals of all stripes, Obama, and big government.

That is, after all, the logic of the death penalty.Political writer, author, mediator and death penalty appeals lawyerWe know that nuclear weapons are scary, but we must be much louder in defining them as unacceptable, as illegitimate.
