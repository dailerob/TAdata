{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Director of the emergencies program at Human Rights WatchI am currently in Hungary, documenting the journeys of Syrian refugees, the very journey that today took another young life. It\u0027s easy to blame the parents for exposing their son to such deadly danger, but only if you forget the barrel bombs and Islamic State beheadings that they are fleeing. All morning yesterday at the Serbian-Hungarian border, I saw Syrian parents determinedly walking with their children -- trying to remove them from the horrors of the slaughter in Syria, which have been allowed to continue for four years, and to the promise of security in Europe. Those parents are heroes; I admire their sheer determination to bring their children to a better life.By loving our kids, and loving them unconditionally, we\u0027re giving them an enormous advantage. That love is a private gift that stands entirely outside of money, position and power.Editor-at-Large and former Executive Features Editor of The Huffington PostThis \"wave of people\" is more like a trickle when considered against the pool that must absorb it. The influx this year is only 0.068 percent of the EU\u0027s population. Before we get carried away by apocalyptic rhetoric, we should recognize that if there is a crisis, it is one of politics, not capacity.Executive director of Human Rights WatchBy continuing to invest in these and other proven interventions -- especially those aimed at saving newborns during their vulnerable first month -- we can use the next 15 years to cut the child-mortality rate by half again. But let\u0027s face it: What we really want for children -- for our own children, for anyone\u0027s children -- is not simply to survive, but to thrive.Co-chair, the Bill and Melinda Gates FoundationI had been talking about how to get more sleep for a long time -- but really I was just complaining about being tired. I like being awake; my work, friends and family are compelling, and I\u0027ve always been willing to trade sleep for exercise.Vice President of People Development at GoogleThe good news is that we\u0027re uniquely poised to achieve dramatic progress toward many of the ambitious targets of SDG3. Right now, we have a once-in-human-history opportunity to achieve what we are calling a \"grand convergence\" in global health.Charles W. Eliot University Professor and President Emeritus at Harvard UniversityProfessor of the Practice of Global Health and Public Policy at Duke University, and a member of The Lancet CommissionWhat do you say during your last few minutes \"on Earth\"? Things will break. We will not. How I know that I just can\u0027t say. I think it\u0027s because we prefer to laugh more than we like just about anything else. Even science. Even being astronauts for a year during NASA\u0027s longest planned Mars simulation.Chief Medical Officer of HI-SEAS IV, Earth\u0027s longest simulated Mars mission. Physician, medical writer, science educator.Still, 6.3 million children continue to die each year in their first month of life. That\u0027s nearly 17,000 each and every day. Most of these deaths can easily be prevented.President, Save the Children Action NetworkI was miserable, so I decided to take a break from drinking to see if my life would improve. Now I haven\u0027t had a drink in 40 days and here are six ways I feel that my life has improved since.A 22 year old psychology student, puppy momma and blogger on www.liv-light.orgPresented as containing some damning revelations, upon closer examination the emails simply produced more yawns. They contained nothing proving any kind of wrongdoing on the part of Clinton. (Unless Clinton aide Huma Abedin using emails to organize a small dinner for the former secretary of state now qualifies as wrongdoing.)Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaEurope cannot close its doors to people who are fleeing war and persecution, as this would entail betraying the fundamental values which make it a model worldwide. Barbed wire fences will also tear at the fabric of its soul.President of the Chamber of Deputies, ItalyGiven the significant invasion of privacy occasioned by the use of drones by law enforcement, warrants should be mandatory before using them for surveillance. And weaponized drones of any sort should be outlawed.Professor, Thomas Jefferson School of LawPositing the blame solely on a vocal, but still small group of individuals who voice these concerns, calling this a \"movement\" in order to fan the flames of reaction, and slapping them with a dismissive label only makes matters worse.Louise Hewlett Nixon Professor, Stanford UniversityBrown didn\u0027t take responsibility for the mistakes of the past. His love letter to himself was about all of the ways he was wronged or misunderstood. His regrets seems to revolve around not more accurately predicting how the media and congressional investigators would spin his words, take what he said out of context, or lay blame at his door.Vice President, Strategy \u0026 External Affairs, The Bromwich Group. Views expressed are her own.How was Santorum able to take peer-reviewed scientific research and distort it beyond recognition? To understand how science can get distorted, you need to understand the techniques of science denial.Researcher in climate communication at The University of QldSome men shy away from the nursing field because of the perception that nursing is a female-dominated field. But, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, the proportion of male nurses has increased significantly over the years. As a male nurse myself, here are nine things that I have learned along the way.Once upon a time I was a refugee who, unlike many of my relatives, was fortunate to escape persecution and genocide. Despite the refugee crisis being the largest humanitarian one since World War II, the UN has done little other than decry Europe\u0027s belated and confused response to the problem.Nonresident Fellow, Brookings InstitutionYou already know about the worst types of people on Instagram. Sometimes, though, an otherwise lovely account is marred by a misstep: a cringe-worthy pic that was probably better off remaining in your camera roll forever. Here, 15 photos to avoid posting. Your followers will thank you.The women\u0027s lifestyle destinationNo, I will not paint your nails right before you eat popcorn. That is just pointless.Blogger, \"Carriage Before Marriage\"America is \"treating\" mental illness through incarceration -- and the price we are paying as a country is enormous.Writer, Filmmaker, Actress - Brave New Films; The ProtologVice President, Impact JusticeWe need to remember how artists\u0027 work can make things easier to see, that together we must continue to make our country a more vibrant, transparent, clear-eyed, self-aware place.Culture Columnist, Huffington Post, CultureZohnTo parents who want to provide a memorable Labor Day weekend for your children, I wish you well. After you vacuum the minivan, drop the dog at the kennel, and hunt down one damn DVD that isn\u0027t scratched to death, you might want to toss out your laminated itinerary, bedazzle your noise-reducing headphones and prepare for Plan B.Writer, cheesehead, dreamer.Yo-Yo Ma\u0027s remarkable sounds emerge from a collaboration between him and his cello. We choose to view his contributions as more important. We don\u0027t view Yo-Yo Ma as mere facilitator of sounds produced by the cello. There\u0027s nothing that prevents us from granting the same kind of recognition to humans whose jobs require them to collaborate with computers.Author, The Sceptical Optimist: Why Technology Isn\u0027t the Answer to EverythingPut simply, we need to do some unlearning in our lives. I have observed that there are key things we do that keep us stuck, unhappy and living in the past. By holding on and continuing to do these we are guilty of sabotaging our success, our sense of peace and our joy.Confidence Coach, New York CityKim Davis, as county clerk, is engaging her personal prejudices by refusing to issue marriage licenses to gay couples. That she claims her bigotry is religiously based is immaterial to whether or not she has to do her job.President, Moorfield Storey InstituteGovernor Brown\u0027s signature on legislation increasing the filing fee for citizens who file ballot initiatives from $200 to $2,000 is the modern equivalent of the famous salvo attributed to Marie Antoinette upon hearing of a famine among the French peasants, \"Let Them Eat Cake.\"President, Consumer WatchdogPolicymakers have recently sought to regulate the long shadow cast by social media slip-ups. In Europe and California, laws now exist that enable people to take digital erasers to their online activity, deleting stains we once considered permanent. But rather than empower individuals to purify their online personas, our culture needs to become more tolerant of a generation\u0027s habit to airs its flaws online.Blogs Editor, Huffington PostOn September 5th and every day afterwards remember that there are no human rights that \"they\" are denied that \"we\" enjoy, be that defined by gender or geography. When it comes to humanity, we are them and they are us.Executive Director, A Woman’s NationWashington obviously intends sanctions to cause economic hardship, but for what purpose? In the early 1990s Khartoum supported Saddam Hussein\u0027s Iraq against America and dallied with Islamic radicalism, even inviting Osama bin Laden to stay. However, that practice ended after 9/11.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteWhile the world\u0027s eyes were on Roanoke last week, this week most national and international media have made their exodus from this small community I now call home, and though their focus is on the next horrible breaking news story, it\u0027s as if time was frozen here. 8/26/15.Broadcast JournalistI want to find out how other countries are fighting for democracy against its corruption by powerful private interests. My learning began in a conversation with Secretary General Yves Leterme of the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA), a Stockholm-based organization of 28 member states.Author, \u0027Diet for a Small Planet\u0027Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
