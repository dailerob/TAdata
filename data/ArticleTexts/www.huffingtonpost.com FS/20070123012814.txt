{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"APDivorced from the reality of what\u0027s going on in Iraq. Wedded to a deluded perception of the war. Unwilling to acknowledge widespread and irrefutable evidence to the contrary. Sound like anyone you know? No, I\u0027m not talking about President Bush -- though it\u0027s certainly true of him as well. I\u0027m talking about the mainstream media, and their relentless depiction of the Iraq war as a left/right issue, even as the facts give lie to this outdated, obsolete, and thunderingly inaccurate framing. Poll after poll attests to the bipartisan nature of the support for ending the war. But you\u0027d never know it from watching the pundits on television.READ POST | comments (137)01.22.2007 Esther DysonEditors coach, they encourage, they ask awkward questions, they help people to do their best work and they guard them from mistakes.READ POST01.22.2007 Greg NickelsWe now have 369 mayors pledging to do what the Bush Administration will not: take meaningful steps to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases that are toasting the planet.READ POST | comments01.22.2007 Nathan GardelsDavos gets it right because its motto, which might be described as \"follow the money, with the conscience trailing behind,\" pretty much approximates how the world works.READ POST | comments01.22.2007 Bob CescaAfter the hydrocarbon law is passed, an enormous influx in Big Oil lobbyists and negotiators will certainly ride into Baghdad like well-dressed ticks clinging tenaciously to the necks of our soldiers.READ POST | comments (20)01.22.2007 Robert L.

How would you feel about someone showing up at your place of work to do more or less what you do, for free?READ POST | comments01.22.2007 Dave Johnson and James BoyceThe right wing has employed a powerful strategy of \"$ell and Smear.\" They insist on being the gatekeepers to public opinion and have developed a powerful machine that tells us who to like - and who to hate.READ POST | comments (21)01.22.2007 Tony DokoupilJournalists covering a black candidate are more likely to emphasize party affiliation and voter demographics, while providing relatively less coverage of substantive issues.READ POST | comments (14)01.22.2007 Steve CaseMany problems with our health care system require government solutions.
