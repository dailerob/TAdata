{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AP/Charles DharapakYesterday\u0027s in-your-face decision by Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, Iraq\u0027s most influential Shiite leader, to renege on his pledge to amend the new Constitution in a manner acceptable to Sunnis is the match that could ignite an all-out civil war in Iraq. But despite this looming disaster, the mainstream media are giving this major development hardly any play, with the New York Times\u0027 news coverage appearing on page A-10, the Washington Post\u0027s on A-14, and the Los Angeles Times and USA Today not covering the story at all. And there wasn\u0027t a single mention of the story on any of the broadcast or cable news shows!READ POST | comments (15)01.12.2006 Nora EphronI\u0027m with Oprah, who said the whole concern over whether Frey was telling the truth or not was just \"much ado about nothing.\" I feel the same way about what the President says about how we\u0027re doing in the war. I mean, big deal. We have got to get past these details and focus on what is important.READ POST | comments01.12.2006 Rep. John MurthaThese particular explosive hatreds and tensions will be there if our troops leave in six months, six years or six decades. It is time to re-deploy our troops and to re-focus our attention on the real threats posed by global terrorism.READ POST | comments (57)01.12.2006 Robert SchlesingerSince 1998, lobbyists have served as treasurer on the personal or leadership PACs of 79 lawmakers. How did we get here?READ POST | comments01.12.2006 Bob CescaWhy am I defending Alito on this front? The non-stop badgering made his wife cry. From now on, any question that might make Mrs. Alito cry is off limits.READ POST | comments (26)01.12.2006 Martin GarbusThat Samuel Alito is bright, personable, Catholic and a devoted son and husband, is adroit at avoiding a question, is interesting, but less important than where he votes will lead to.READ POST | comments (25)01.12.2006 Katrina vanden HeuvelToday, some thirty years after Watergate, Elizabeth Holtzman, a leader in the impeachment of Richard Nixon, returns to the national stage stage to make the case for impeachment again: this time against President George W. Bush.READ POST | comments (67)01.12.2006 Max BlumenthalPeter Kirsanow\u0027s mere presence today as a pro-Alito witness raises serious questions about the nominee\u0027s willingness to protect established legal precedent on civil rights.READ POST | comments (29)01.12.2006 Harry ShearerCNN drove me crazy with the Quad Split -- a four-way divide of the TV screen: a shot of Alito, a shot of his questioner (so far, so good) and then, inexplicably, a long shot of the hearing room and a LIVE!!!!! exterior shot of the Supreme Court.READ POST | comments01.11.2006 Suzanne NosselAl Qaeda and its insurgent enemies in Iraq are locked in cycles of vicious killing and revenge, but the bloodshed is only making Iraq more difficult to control.READ POST | comments01.11.2006 James P. HoffaIt was the deadliest train crash in nearly 30 years, spewing a poisonous cloud of chlorine gas over the small community of Graniteville, South Carolina. And it could happen again.READ POST | comments01.11.2006 David Mixner and James McGreeveyBy embracing the age-old virtue of loving thy fellow man, many of these tenacious McDowell County residents find redemption for themselves. Marsha Timpson is one of those people.READ POST | comments01.11.2006 Jonathan TasiniIt\u0027s ironic that the people who can\u0027t be bothered to provide the right equipment to save the lives of hundreds of soldiers run around attacking the call for immediate withdrawal of the troops as a danger to morale.READ POST | comments (39)01.11.2006 Ralph DittmanThe shy, yet charismatic Dr. Woo-suk Hwang will go down in the annals of scientific history as one of the most brazen perpetrators of scientific chicanery.READ POST | comments01.11.2006 Michael SmerconishIf The Smoking Gun has it right then James Frey is a dirtbag. Worse, a dirtbag who hurt people - people are the least equipped to withstand his harm.READ POST | comments (21)01.11.2006 Hooman Majdit strikes one as rather bizarre that after over forty years of Fidel Castro\u0027s rule, our government still believes that Cuba might fall into our laps at any moment.READ POST | comments (27)01.11.2006 Jeralyn MerrittBloggers and liberal organizations are much harsher in than the MSM in their analysis of Alito\u0027s performance yesterday. Digby calls Alito a \"freeper.\" Armando at Daily Kos calls Alito Say Anything Sammy, while Jane at Firedoglake calls him Strip-Search Sammy.READ POST | comments (37)01.11.2006 Bill BarolCNN just bannered some hours-old video of a Las Vegas hotel implosion with the words \"DEVELOPING STORY.\" Question over here, please: In what sense is a hotel implosion not a finite event?READ POST | comments (12)01.11.2006 Richard BradleyI could easily have made up some \"facts\" about my subject, John Kennedy, or attributed quotes to him that would have stirred up controversy and sold more books. But, well, that would be wrong.READ POST | comments (17)01.11.2006 David SirotaIf you want to know why many people believe the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC) severely hobbles the Democratic Party and gives cover to the worst right-wing stereotypes, just take a look at a guy they employ named Marshall Wittman.READ POST | comments (80)01.11.2006 Micah SifryWhen will one of those charitable organizations who are now being showered with campaign contributions from Abramoff and his clients tell their would-be benefactors, \"we don\u0027t want your dirty money\"?READ POST | comments (16)AP/ Ng Han GuanAP/Gerald HerbertAP/Charles DharapakFrom livescience.comFrom katu.comFrom handbag.comLogin to Huffington Post  |  Make Huff Post your Home Page  |  RSS/XML  |  Sitemap  |  Advertising  |  JobsCopyright 2005 © HuffingtonPost.com, LLC   |  User Agreement  |  Privacy  |  Comment Policy  |  Powered by MovableType","h1":"",".title":"","h2":"Murtha: Iraq Is Not Part Of The War On Terrorism...As The President Portrays It...
