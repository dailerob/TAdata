{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Director of the Earth Institute, Columbia U. Author of \"The Price of Civilization\"With President Obama\u0027s jobs speech on Monday and Speaker Boehner\u0027s jobs speech yesterday, we can put the Democratic and Republican Party economic plans side by side. What is stunning is that neither side offers a serious diagnosis or a solution. The truth this time is not in the middle -- a compromise of the two views. The truth, alas, requires a new view, and probably a new party. Most Americans now are suffering the decline of American living standards and loss of American competitiveness as those in Washington turn their backs on education, science, and infrastructure. This country\u0027s revival will only come through a new political movement, one that isn\u0027t on the take.Read Post | Comments (391)Martina Davis-Correia, 9/16/11Sister of Troy DavisMy son was six weeks old when I first brought him to meet his uncle, Troy Davis.

This is a national disgrace.Read Post | Comments (130)Sen. Bernie Sanders, 9/16/11Independent U.S. Senator from VermontIt\u0027s time to lift the veil of secrecy in the oil futures market. The American people have a right to know how much excessive speculation has driven up oil prices and which Wall Street firms are doing it.Read Post | Comments (272)Daphne Eviatar, 9/16/11Senior Associate, Human Rights First’s Law and Security ProgramAs if we didn\u0027t have enough wars already, a battle is now reportedly taking place within the Obama administration over whether the U.S. government has the legal authority to kill low-level suspected terrorist supporters where the U.S. now has troops on the ground.Read Post | Comments (23)Shane Claiborne, 9/16/11Activist and bestselling author, \u0027The Irresistible Revolution\u0027It is this dual conviction that no one is above reproach and that no one is beyond redemption that lies at the heart of our faith. Undoubtedly it\u0027s why the early Christians were characterized by non-violence.Read Post | Comments (30)Paul Slansky, 9/16/11Writer; Contributor to The New YorkerWe don\u0027t need Sarah Palin anymore. After three years of overexposure to her tawdry toxicity, we know her too well, and our remaining schadenfreudal needs will more than be met by the cornucopia of damning nuggets Joe McGinniss has unearthed.Read Post | Comments (335)Howard Kissel, 9/16/11Blogger, Cultural Tourist\"Follies\" is a look backward at an art form that represented innocence at the moment when Vietnam cast its shadow over everything and rendered the very idea of innocence dubious. It is a musical full of ambiguity and irony and an irresistible musical power.Read Post | CommentsElisabeth Braw, 9/16/11Senior Reporter, Metro InternationalThey\u0027ve been talking about it. They\u0027ve been negotiating about it. Some have used violence to achieve it. Now, say Palestinians, they\u0027ll finally become a state. Metro met Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad for an exclusive interview.Read Post | Comments (48)Beth Arnold, 9/16/11Journalist and award-winning writer, living in ParisIn general, I know that going off the Internet cold turkey for four weeks will be a shocking change to my body, mind and lifestyle ...

Websites like Politifact try to sort things out. But people still seem willing to believe the most negative things about two of our most durable social programs: Social Security and Medicare.Read Post | Comments (570)Jeff Reeves, 9/16/11Financial journalist, Editor, InvestorPlace.comAmericans need loans to start businesses, go to college, buy homes, protect themselves in times of crisis and countless other things. The nation needs to relearn how to use debt as a tool to build and protect wealth, not destroy it.Read Post | Comments (53)Cynthia Ellis, 9/16/11Writer/JournalistChristina Hendricks has the old-world, but never old, sex appeal of our Marilyn, and is perhaps our first red-headed pin-up since Rita Hayworth.

Social networks and the web have not changed human nature, but they have provided a swifter delivery system for news and an engaging platform for discussion.Read Post | CommentsBob Cesca, 9/15/11Producer, Editor of BobCesca.comThe cable news media has gone from simply cracking gaming and sports metaphors to actually becoming a game, with politicians as the contestants and a rotating guest panel of snickering propagandists and \"analysts\" as the judges.Read Post | Comments (474)Bruce A. Barron, 9/16/11Adjunct Professor at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine and Professor at New York University School of MedicineI present this discussion to demonstrate how misleading it is to attempt to inform the public about a complex issue sandwiched between advertisements for the treatment of bladder control and erectile dysfunction.Read Post | CommentsRobert Reich, 9/16/11Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Aftershock\u0027The Weapon of Mass Cynicism has convinced most Americans they can\u0027t rely on government to help with anything. But if we can\u0027t trust government at a time like this, whom can we trust? Corporations? Wall Street? Warren Buffett? Or is each of us now simply on our own?Read Post | Comments (671)Michael Shaw, 9/16/11Publisher of BagNewsNotes, topping LIFE.com\u0027s 2011 Best Photo BlogsConsidering that TIME has always reserved the \"big floating head\" treatment for shoe-in nominees, their Rick Perry cover suggests an air of inevitability.Read Post | Comments (121)Rep. Steny Hoyer, 9/16/11At this moment, more than 700,000 patents are caught in the backlog.
