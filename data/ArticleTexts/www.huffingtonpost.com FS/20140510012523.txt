{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonToday is the 9th anniversary of the launch of The Huffington Post. There is so much to celebrate, so much that has exceeded my wildest dreams -- no, back in 2005, I wasn\u0027t dreaming of more than 90 million unique visitors a month, more than 60 verticals, more than 50,000 bloggers, more than 300 million comments, or double-digit international editions, a game-changing live streaming network, and a wall-full of awards. Looking back, however, there are a number of things that I know now that I wish I\u0027d known then. To mark our 9th anniversary, here are 9 of them...In commemoration of our ninth birthday, here\u0027s a look back at nine memorable blog posts since 2005 -- one from each year.The Huffington Post BlogWhat if most of us aren\u0027t \"gay\" or \"straight,\" but somewhere in between? Artist and activist iO Tillett Wright makes a passionate case for accepting the complexity of individuality -- without making anybody feel like a second-class citizen. If her words don\u0027t persuade you, the images she shares just might.TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"The situation in Nigeria has focused us on the plight of these abducted girls, but were we blind before to this possibility? It always takes a current event to snap us out of our collective fog, to clear away the cobwebs of our own inaction and make us take notice. What can we do to help them and to make our Mother\u0027s Day mean a little more?Jamie Lee CurtisActress and children\u0027s book authorWhat piece of advice did your mother give you that has had a lasting impact?Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistSix decades into the \"post-Brown v. Board\" era, will the doors of opportunity finally open wide or continue to stay half shut on our watch? It\u0027s time to close the opportunity gap and fulfill the promise of education as a great equalizer and a strong pathway to opportunity for all of our nation\u0027s children.Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundSimple question. Are you Nigerian? If not, I have news you. You can\u0027t do anything about the girls missing in Nigeria. You can\u0027t. Your insistence on urging American power, specifically American military power, to address this issue will ultimately hurt the people of Nigeria.Jumoke BalogunCo-Founder of CompareAfrique.comBeau CoffronHusband, father and blogger, LunchboxDad.comThe name of Washington, D.C.\u0027s football team is a racial slur, a racist epithet. The U.S. trademark office agrees; so does the dictionary. But more importantly, Native American people feel it. How important is that to the rest of us? That is the moral question for all of us: Are we going to show respect for our nation\u0027s original citizens?Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersI have a friend who lovingly placed her child for adoption because she was too young to be a mother herself. While she\u0027s comforted by the feeling that she made the right choice, there remains in her a sense of longing -- the innate desire to be a mother. Mother\u0027s Day reminds her of those things.Seth Adam SmithAuthor and Blogger at SethAdamSmith.comWe are taught to believe that everyone thinks the same way, that everyone is in control of their own mind, and that free will operates under their command. This is the paradox of living with a chronic and disabling thought disorder. We know differently. Everyone knows differently.Henry Boy JenkinsBlogger, BringChange2Mind.orgI have been watching Russian and French television all day, and for the former, fascinating TV agitprop -- ????? ???????? ? ?????????? -- set against the grand fireworks display in Moscow and Sebastopol.Michael VlahosIs thinking positive and cultivating a happy and balanced outlook important to people with cancer? Absolutely. Is telling someone else to think positive even the slightest bit helpful? Not at all. And don\u0027t get me started on The Secret.Dr. Nikhil JoshiPhysician, speaker and author of \u0027The End of Suffering\u0027Michael ShawPublisher of the visual politics and media literacy site, BagNewsNotesWe\u0027ve been able to get to the bottom of nine common spirits myths and what we\u0027ve found is, to be honest, quite mind-blowing.Liquor.comLiquor.comSome people consider themselves highly educated and lettered literarians, but in fact they are often ULTRACREPIDARIAN -- a word which refers to someone who gives an opinion on things s/he knows nothing about.Oliver TearleAuthor; Lecturer in English, Loughborough Univ.Let\u0027s celebrate with the same spirit as the women whose activism sparked the holiday in the first place. Let\u0027s celebrate by taking action. Support the women around us. Fight for family-focused public policy. Lift up women in office who are writing these policies, and elect more women like them. A card is nice. Change is better.Barbara LeePresident, Barbara Lee Political Office and Barbara Lee Family FoundationMedia coverage of drugs and drug policy has grown much more sophisticated in the past quarter-century. Yet many journalists still often use inaccurate, offensive, or just plain absurd language that would be considered unthinkable when covering any other issue.Jag DaviesPublications Manager, Drug Policy AllianceA lot of people say that Mother\u0027s Day is one of those \"Hallmark holidays\" that don\u0027t really exist in the calendar, and I can certainly see their point. The commercialization of Mother\u0027s Day doesn\u0027t enhance anyone\u0027s idea of family. But there\u0027s another way that society is \"dumbing down\" motherhood that we must name and shame.Terry O\u0027NeillPresident, National Organization for WomenI had a conversation years ago with Grigory Yavlinsky, who lost to Putin in Russia\u0027s 2000 presidential election. When I asked what Putin was like, Yavlinsky said, \"He has the mind of a mid-level KGB officer.\" That struck me as right then, and in the years since and especially in the last couple of months I think Yavlinsky has been proven right.Ted KaufmanFmr. U.S. Senator from DelawareConsider how much time you commit to shaping your ass versus the time you commit to opening your heart. Let\u0027s redefine what the face of sexy looks like.Jesse BrunePersonal trainer; chef; co-founder and director, Project Service LAThe Common Core is not a national curriculum, because it is not a curriculum at all. It is only a set of standards, and that\u0027s completely different from the scope and sequence of curriculum planning. But like that terrible Match.com date you went on, the standards/curriculum distinction only looks good on paper.Peter GreeneTeacher, writerOnce upon a time, etiquette was important.Bon AppetitBon Appétit MagazineMy commitment to organics is to make sure I do my part to leave my children with a better, healthier planet. It\u0027s not just about today and this moment -- rather, it\u0027s about doing things with expanded thought and an interest in seeing a healthier future.Bill CouzensFounder, Lesscancer.orgOften I would wonder, \"What\u0027s wrong with me? Why doesn\u0027t he like me?\" My mother helped me realize that this line of thinking was becoming self-destructive.Tamara Duricka JohnsonJournalist and author of \u002731 Dates in 31 Days\u0027Today I define myself as a happy, successful, devilishly handsome 44 year-old guy with a wonderful family and a bunch of great friends. Had I given up and let those first two doctors define me, I never would\u0027ve made it past 23.Chris EdwardsAdvertising Copywriter, Creative Director and Author of the upcoming memoir, \"Balls\"Can\u0027t we please at least get to see one Puerto Rican (or any other Latino character for that matter) portrayed as an actual New York City human being?Michele Carlowriter/performerThis community is about fake sweeteners and zero-point soup and grossing yourself out with your own body.Food RiotPlay with your food.Women are not looking just for love in a marriage; they are primarily looking for lust. A woman wants to be wanted, needs to be needed, desires to be desired.Rabbi Shmuley BoteachRabbi and WriterA job should be a means to an ends. The ends should be economic survival. That relationship has been severed so that the idea of a job is not what it once was.Lincoln Mitchelllincolnmitchell.comIn addition to the escalating cost of dental care, a big reason why many Americans don\u0027t get the checkups and preventive care they need is the growing shortage of dentists in the U.S. We need 6,000 new dentists to eliminate the shortage. There\u0027s little chance we\u0027ll get them, however, at least anytime soon.Wendell PotterAuthor, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"HEEEEEERE\u0027S LARRY!",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
