{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghAmerica\u0027s position in the Middle East is a shambles. That is due in part to forces and circumstances beyond its control. Mainly, though, it owes to the long series of ill-judged actions that Washington has taken at its own volition. Those date from the historic error of invading Iraq, a decision whose roots lay in the gross distortions of the Global War On Terror. Recent developments in Syria, Iraq and Yemen exacerbate deteriorating conditions as the entire region descends deeper into disorder and sectarian war. Yet, Washington proceeds aimlessly along the same dangerous paths while the country\u0027s political class suspends its critical faculties in playing along with these fateful games of make-believe.We are on the cusp of a promising new economic era, with far-reaching benefits for humankind. What\u0027s required now is a global commitment to facilitate the transition to a digitalized green economy if we are to avert catastrophic climate change and create a more prosperous and sustainable society.Author, \u0027The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of Things, the Collaborative Commons, and the Eclipse of Capitalism\u0027I have lived in Columbia and been at the university for almost 18 years. During this time, I have been called the n-word too many times to count. Yes, we are better off now than we were in the \u002750s, but to some extent, we are taking many steps backward by ignoring or not talking about the racial issues.Associate professor, Missouri School of JournalismThese continual strident, shouting, red-faced rebuttals to Atheists and non-Christians and corporations are doing exponentially more harm than good. When did the Good News of Jesus become a massive middle finger to anyone who doesn\u0027t believe what we believe?Rogue Pastor and WriterWhile I\u0027m honored to have been selected to serve on this committee as an advocate for women\u0027s health, the truth is that the Select Committee to Attack Women\u0027s Health is political theatre with no substantive purpose.U.S. Representative, New Jersey\u0027s 12th Congressional DistrictSince France, after fighting hard to toughen the terms of the deal, has ratified it, there are five essential reasons for us to move forward with the process and to play, determinedly but without illusion, the card of rapprochement and dialogue.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.After years of contentious debate, Keystone XL has been rejected once and for all. This is the behind-the-scenes story of how a small group of unlikely allies turned what everyone expected to be a routine governmental approval process into one of the most heated environmental battles in US history -- and prevailed.Canada Project Director, NRDCWalking into the funeral home, I had the same \"What could possibly go wrong?\" mentality of a deer right before he leaps onto the freeway.Business in the front, party in the back.The horserace polls dominating today\u0027s political news are worse than misleading -- they\u0027re bad for democracy. They\u0027re as corrosive for America\u0027s self-image as the news industry\u0027s obsession with murder and disaster. Worse, once the nominees are chosen, the point of poll coverage will be that, unless you live in a handful of zip codes, your vote for president is irrelevant. How\u0027s that for civic uplift?USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorIt doesn\u0027t make you Satan to purchase coffee from a place that doesn\u0027t celebrate Christmas, if that\u0027s even the point they are trying to make. News flash: Jesus died. You can handle a blank red cup. Stop looking for ways to be offended.Blogger, hedgehog owner, lover of caffeine.Increasing physical activity without losing weight will not likely improve these patients\u0027 lives. To improve their health and quality of life, it is important to exercise every day, eat healthy food and, most importantly, lose some weight.Independent source of news and analysis, from the academic and research community.Although President Obama held the pen, the real heroes are the ordinary people who refused to give in, give up, or give way. They came together from an incredible array of backgrounds and communities -- united by a determination not to let Big Oil have its way.Executive Director, The Sierra ClubYou\u0027ve probably seen the video of a Yale student yelling at a professor, the post about a \"white girls only\" party, or the email about offensive Halloween costumes. Unfortunately, the short clips and articles I\u0027ve seen don\u0027t come close to painting an accurate picture of what\u0027s happening at Yale.Senior at Yale studying cognitive science and designDespite a session at the recent Manama Dialogue conference on \"The Challenges of Extremism,\" an issue that can\u0027t be properly addressed without the expertise of civil society experts, there was no room for civil society voices in the agenda.Director, Human Rights First\u0027s Human Rights Defenders ProgramWhile there is merit to looking ahead, to planning, and to dog-earing goals, hopes and possibilities, it\u0027s equally important to pause and appreciate this ground that we stand on, right here and now.Writing, blogging, hoppy ale drinking, stay-at-home-yoga mama machine. Author of The Best Day of Your Life and The Art of Parenting.While DNA might not confirm the legend you\u0027ve heard since you learned to walk, it might bring you a little closer to understanding who your ancestors actually were. Our ancestors were real people, with real successes and real failures.Alphonse Fletcher University Professor and Director of the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research at Harvard UniversityComputational Biologist for AncestryDNAHealthcare today is reactive, retrospective, bureaucratic and expensive. It\u0027s sick care, not healthcare.Chairman/CEO, XPRIZEEven if we believe that self-funded campaigns are less prone to quid pro quo transactions between candidate and donor, surely a system where billionaire politicians hold extraordinary advantages over regular politicians is just as corrupt.Consultant, writer, Yale graduateWe are weaving together a rich tapestry of our women\u0027s stories, told in a uniquely human way. These are stories of hope, courage, aspiration, challenge and achievement. They are meant to inspire, highlight tips and advice and also raise provocative questions about what more can be done.Chief Human Resources Officer, AccentureIn the kerfuffle over presidential candidate Ben Carson\u0027s claim that he was admitted to West Point, the news media have pointed out that the \"full scholarship\" part of his story adds even more confusion because, as the New York Times story today put it, \"Technically, West Point does not offer scholarships. It is free.\" Actually, no, West Point and the other military academies are not free, technically or otherwise.Senior Fellow at The Century Foundation; former education official in the Obama and Clinton AdministrationsEven if the Fed kept interest rates at effectively zero for another year, it\u0027s increasingly clear that monetary policy alone is not sufficient to get unemployment rates down to where they need to be -- or to translate falling jobless rates into raises for workers.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Instead of Netanyahu repenting for what he has done and now agreeing to support the deal, the chutzpah-filled leader of Israel will seek new military weaponry from the U.S. and Obama has already made clear that he will be agreeing to new advanced military weapons.Editor, Tikkun MagazinePutin is trying to burnish his credentials as an international tough guy in Syria, fighting ISIS, or at least appearing to do so. In reality, he seems to be directing bombs against dictator Bashar al-Assad\u0027s beleaguered opposition these days. He\u0027s doing it, because that\u0027s just about all he can do these days.Political science professor, LaGrange College in GeorgiaBurma now has a hybrid system of military rule and democracy. It\u0027s democracy on a leash. The victims of human rights abuses can\u0027t wait for a hoped slow transition. They need genuine democracy, and they need it now. For them it is, quite literally, a matter of life and death.Director of Burma Campaign UKSymbols have meaning and can influence perceptions and values. But they should not be confused with real, operational change on the ground.Executive Director, Columbia University\u0027s Earth InstituteSome recent studies have found a paradox: The pursuit of happiness tends to make individual Americans unhappy. Did the Founding Fathers set us up for failure?Based at the University of California, BerkeleyChristian persecution has become a new religion for many. These people take it on faith that a war on Christianity is being waged in America. The reality is, the only war being waged right now is one to define the religious freedoms afforded to Americans by the Constitution.Political blogger, Detroit NewsIn an age where social media is, for many, the predominant form of news, expression and assembly, allowing any country or any government agencies within a country to ban it is a violation of children\u0027s rights.Technology journalistHenry Kissinger is, of course, not singularly responsible for the evolution of the U.S. national security state into a monstrosity. That state has had many administrators. But his example has coursed through the decades, shedding a spectral light on the road that has brought us to a state of eternal war.Professor of History, New York UniversityFor decades, the regulations for international commerce, for so-called free trade, have lined the pockets of the already wealthy and emptied those of workers thrown out of their jobs.International President, United SteelworkersI want an honest progressive, not a Republican, which is why I will not support Trump or Clinton. Bernie Sanders will win the presidency in 2016 because there are millions of people like me, and I\u0027ll no longer be intimidated by the phrase, \"You can\u0027t let a Republican win!\"Columnist published in The Cleveland Plain Dealer, The Baltimore Sun, The Hill, Salon, The Jerusalem Post www.hagoodman.comGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
