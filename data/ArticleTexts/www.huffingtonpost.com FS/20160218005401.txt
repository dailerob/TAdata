{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressWay, way back in December 2014, The Daily Beast\u0027s Michael Tomasky asked a question that, at the time, no one could really answer: \"Can Marco Rubio even win a primary?\" At the time, Rubio was trailing in the polls in all four of the early state contests, so it was worth asking. Now, however, he ... well, he\u0027s lost two contests and is trailing badly in the other two. But guess what! The Florida senator is winning the political pundit primary, much to the disappointment of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, because that was supposed to be the primary Bush and all his super PAC money was going to win. Yes, Rubio has stacked up a lot of hopeful headlines ahead of the Palmetto State\u0027s contest, all of which suggest that he -- and not Jeb, sorry! -- is on the path to a comeback.Sadly, too often, the stigma around mental health prevents people who need help from seeking it.

How much weed killer is carried from the farm field into our food supply is information the public deserves to know.Veteran former Reuters journalist, current research director for U.S. Right to Know, investigating the risks and rewards of biotech crop technology and agrichemicalsI simply can\u0027t imagine how much harder it is to be a young child today, let alone dealing with bullying.

But the smooth rollout of Medicare-for-Seniors in 1965 -- which many had also predicted would bring chaos -- belies that charge.Professor in the CUNY School of Public Health at Hunter College; Lecturer in Medicine, Harvard Medical School; Co-founder, Physicians for a National Health ProgramProfessor of Public Health at CUNY and Lecturer in Medicine at Harvard Medical School; Co-founder, Physicians for a National Health Programknow these are just a few of the lessons I will continue to learn as I progress forward as a survivor.

The doctors planned his first dose of chemotherapy for mid-January.

So we went on a mad dash search to find the medicine any way we could.Journalist and authorIt shouldn\u0027t have been such a difficult issue.
