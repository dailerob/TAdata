{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorWhy am I highlighting this plan? In part, after all the ink spilled around the Ryan budget, to provide equal time for a progressive vision. But more so, because it\u0027s useful to lay out such a vision -- to articulate all of its moving parts -- in order to see that it\u0027s really quite simple. To hear the rhetoric these days, you\u0027d think faster job creation was impossible -- we\u0027re stuck with structural unemployment, depressed labor force participation, and weak wage growth. You\u0027d think growth deficits and debt were inevitable unless we\u0027re willing to sacrifice our social insurance programs and our safety net. You\u0027d think investment in opportunity and mobility targeted at the least advantaged among us had to be sacrificed in order to achieve fiscal balance. You\u0027d think we have to disinvest in our children today in order to save them from inheriting \"mountains of debt\" tomorrow. Nope.I strongly support the notion of building systems and developing public policies that enable and take advantage of zero marginal costs, for example in the context of various infrastructure and knowledge commons. But what about the fixed costs?Brett FrischmannAuthor, \u0027Infrastructure: The Social Value of Shared Resources\u0027The Web is regularly hailed for its \"openness\" and that\u0027s where the confusion begins, since \"open\" in no way means \"equal.\" While the Internet may create space for many voices, it also reflects and often amplifies real-world inequities in striking ways.Astra TaylorWriter, documentary filmmakerI personally found Nirvana on a remote Eastern European island so small its name could accommodate only two letters.Lance GouldExecutive Impact editor, The Huffington PostIt makes sense why the \"21 Days\" myth would spread. It\u0027s easy to understand. The time frame is short enough to be inspiring, but long enough to be believable. And who wouldn\u0027t like the idea of changing your life in just three weeks?James ClearEntrepreneur, weightlifter, and travel photographer at http://jamesclear.comHere at Harvard, where students have big dreams and an abundance of resources, it can be difficult to allow ourselves the time to put away our devices and relax. In the spirit of Arianna\u0027s visit to campus, I interviewed Harvard students on how they \"thrive.\"Eva ShangEditor-at-Large, Harvard UniversityIf a network chose to place a woman behind the desk of a late night show, there would be an opportunity to do something both historic and radical -- suggest that the voice of a female comedian is as relevant as that of her male counterpart.Ann marie HoughtailingAuthor, founder, Millionaire Girls\u0027 MovementThe news regarding the Star-Ledger isn\u0027t just about the challenges New Jersey\u0027s largest newspaper faces with a newsroom one-third its previous size. The larger question is what happens to newsgathering, and what happens to a democracy, when the cutbacks show no signs of abating while super-donor forces in politics exert unprecedented influence?Eric BoehlertSenior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaI had 11 surgeries. It\u0027s been almost 10 months now. I still don\u0027t know how to run, and things still hurt. I still have a ways to go. My physical therapist told me to stop thinking about my rehab in days and weeks and start thinking about it in seasons.Oral FixationA Live Storytelling Series in Dallas, Texas Featuring True, Personal StoriesWe see music and art as cultural bridges from the Middle East to the world. The arts offer the best representation of a people. They transcend politics, race, religion, color and language.Badr JafarChief Executive, Crescent Enterprises; Impact EntrepreneurWe stopped outside the fraternity house. One girl ran over to the front walk and crouched down about 20 feet from the front door.Katie KoestnerDirector, Take Back The Night FoundationCNN took off with the Malaysian airliner\u0027s disappearance and hasn\u0027t landed since. And it has been widely ridiculed for it. But before you laugh, it\u0027s worth considering if CNN is onto something here. At least commercially.Marwan BisharaAl Jazeera\u0027s senior political analyst and host of the Al Jazeera program \u0027Empire\u0027There is a small space between experiencing something in our lives and reacting to it. For most of us, that space hardly exists.Mary-Lou StephensAuthor, Sex, Drugs and MeditationOur society loves success, but even more we love failure. Infrequently do we admire, or even talk about, what happens in between.Michael Brooks Jr.CTO and Co-Founder @Spire; UX/UI Designer; Soccer playerThe world is OK if we take a few hours to ourselves to relax and revive a little. I start the weekend relaxed, organized and in a splendid mood. Do you need any more reasons?Susie MooreLife Coach, New York CityOn day one, Comcast will control nearly 50 percent of the truly high-speed Internet market, and it will be the only broadband provider that can deliver Internet and pay-TV services to nearly four out of every 10 U.S. homes.Craig AaronPresident and CEO, Free PressMike SmithLas Vegas Sun’s editorial cartoonistIn case you\u0027ve ever looked at the whitewashed array of dystopian and post-apocalyptic books that line the shelves and asked yourself, \"Do people of color survive the apocalypse?\" the answer is yes. Read these books.Olivia ColePoet, author, and activistThe drug war has increasingly become a war against migrant communities. It fuels racial profiling, border militarization, violence against immigrants, intrusive government surveillance and, especially, widespread detentions and deportations.Daniel RobeloResearch associate in the Drug Policy Alliance’s Office of Legal Affairs in Berkeley, CaliforniaDehydration can also cause kidney stones, because it allows for stone-causing minerals to concentrate and settle in the kidneys and urinary tract. One of the best measures you can take to avoid kidney stones is to drink plenty of water, resulting in passing lots of clear urine.Leslie Spry, M.D., FACPNational Kidney Foundation spokesperson; Medical director, Dialysis Center of Lincoln, Neb.Nothing truly brilliant comes from meager output, nothing worth doing is not met by some sort of equal resistance. The darkness polarizes the light, it takes trudging through the darkness and abandoning yourself to realize that the light is worth the fight.Sean SmithMarketer, writer, and creative strategistWe spend many more resources policing and prosecuting crime in the streets than crime in the suites, even though corporate crime is much more costly in terms of death, injury and disease.Peter DreierE.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeThe idea of \"gaming\" your already-excellent credit score to drive it up is not going to benefit you in any substantive way -- there\u0027s little or no difference between the interest rates or credit terms offered to people with an 800 and those offered to people with the elusive 850. So gaming it doesn\u0027t help anything but your ego.Adam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911\"I never pressed charges because I wanted to protect you. I couldn\u0027t bear to see another black man in jail.\"Gordon BraxtonBlogger and activistThe United States is missing out on economic opportunities every single day the House of Representatives refuses to act on comprehensive immigration reform. We cannot let the economic growth and job creation that millions of new Americans would bring slip through our fingers.Rep. Joe GarciaRep. Jared PolisRep. Joaquin CastroGeena RoceroModel, Transgender activistOn April 9, the US Senate held its first hearing on the proposed Comcast-Time Warner deal -- a $45 billion transaction that will affect millions of consumers and further pad some already well-lined pockets.Michael WinshipSenior writer, Moyers \u0026 Company on public TV. Senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.Ask most women about their book clubs and I\u0027ll bet they mention wine within 30 seconds. Husbands laugh at their wives who use literature as an excuse to impress their friends with phyllo-pastry appetizers. So what\u0027s the big deal? The problem isn\u0027t with the clubs themselves, but with the stereotype they reinforce: women may read fiction, but they don\u0027t take it seriously.Angelina ChapinBlogs Editor, Huffington Post CanadaEven if Washington were to resolve the conflict over the Holy Land, it is unlikely that that would help reduce the power of the radicals to lessen the chances for war in the region.Leon T. HadarSenior Analyst, WikistratThe new-wave acts of the early \u002780s represent everything that mainstream pop acts aren\u0027t so free to be today. Imagine One Direction hitting the stage dressed like Kajagoogoo. Would teenage girls still go wild? Would Taylor Swift have dated one of them?Jeremy HelligarFreelance journalist, blogger, author, ‘Is It True What They Say about Black Men?’Last year, Englewood\u0027s very own, Interscope Records recording artist Chief Keef, moved to the north suburban enclave of Northfield.
