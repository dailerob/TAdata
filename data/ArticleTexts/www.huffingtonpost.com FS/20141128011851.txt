{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President and CEO of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)Two days after the grand jury\u0027s decision not to indict Darren Wilson for the death of Michael Brown, there appears so little to be thankful for. Decades of overaggressive policing are all too common in all too many communities that some may want to give up. But today, as we celebrate Thanksgiving, be encouraged that even in the midst of such profound sadness and darkness, there are still glimmers of hope and things worthy of gratitude: We can be grateful for the young activists of yesterday and today, our country\u0027s ability to transform for the better and our own capacity to effect meaningful change. Peaceful, nonviolent protest is part and parcel of our American tradition -- from Selma to Montgomery to Occupy Wall Street. And in each of these instances, our young people have stepped up and stood on the front lines for justice. For each of them, we can be grateful.Through daily moral consciousness we must all counter the proliferating voices of racial and ethnic and religious division that are regaining too much respectability over the land.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundFrom 12 to 50 it\u0027s assumed we\u0027re packing, assumed that like the Hulk or zombies we possess superhuman, virtually unstoppable destructive power. So where an average citizen may disagree, even argue and berate a police officer, treating them as the public servant that they indeed are, a black man, if he wishes to continue living, must channel his ancestors.Novelist, Screenwriter, and Associate Professor at Columbia UniversityWe now all have the chance to examine the evidence -- released last night -- in the grand jury\u0027s decision not to indict white police officer Darren Wilson, who fired multiple bullets into Michael Brown. But the verdict on America\u0027s criminal justice system is already in for many Americans: guilty, for treating young black men differently than young white men.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersI want to offer a special thanks to the technologists of the world -- all those who work anonymously in the world\u0027s labs and engineering departments to come up with the circuits, code, and contraptions that have combined to change life as I know it.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarIn some places, the police seem, and act, like an occupying force. If the law does not represent you but only governs you, you are a subject, not a citizen. So what are the \"blessings\" that Americans should \"gratefully acknowledge,\" as Abraham Lincoln put it in the 1863 proclamation creating the first national Thanksgiving?Professor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027We are in a state of emergency, a time of challenge and controversy, but not because of the protestors. That state of emergency will continue until we stand, become uncomfortable, and demand a justice system that addresses the manifestation of pain in protest, the further chipping away of respect, and the real state of emergency our country faces.Director of African American Religious Affairs, People For the American Way and People For the American Way FoundationAs we sit around our holiday table, we can celebrate the manifold opportunities to teach our parents, children, grandchildren and guests that it would be a terrible waste of life if all we focused on was our own personal blessings without simultaneously raising to consciousness all that needs \u0027tikkun.\u0027Editor, Tikkun MagazineMany American children won\u0027t have a safe, stable home this holiday season. Homelessness among families with children isn\u0027t an intractable problem; federal rental assistance -- like the Housing Choice Voucher program -- is an effective solution. But funding is seriously inadequate and has faced significant cuts.Senior Policy Analyst, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesThanksgiving is all about giving thanks, and being grateful and kind is not something we should restrict to this time of year. It\u0027s a gift that keeps on giving all year long -- not just for those we interact with, but for ourselves as well.AuthorIt occurred to me that afternoon as I was heading toward a stroke that no amount of facts or evidence was going to change this guy\u0027s mind and that neither of us was going to leave unscathed. I took the easy way out and said, \"I\u0027m sorry, but I\u0027ve stopped arguing with people who are impervious to reality,\" and left it at that.Richard Zombeck is a freelance writer for hire living in the Boston area and hangs out at www.zombeckink.comThis year the day after Thanksgiving will be remembered not as the biggest shopping day of the year but as the day Americans took action to demand that Walmart, the country\u0027s largest employer, pay workers livable wages and play a part in improving our economy.E.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeYou don\u0027t have to feel like an outsider this holiday season. Join the party and live full out. Just make sure you devote more time to your health than you do to your indulgences and then you can start your New Year without any guilt for how you ended this year.National fitness expert, speaker, contributor to Prevention magazine, author of several books and fitness DVDsI don\u0027t think the fate of Darren Wilson as a human being really means anything to the ruling class. At the end of the day, people like Bob McCulloch aren\u0027t protecting Wilson so much as the system that he stood for.Author, \u0027Tear Down This Myth\u0027Have you ever seen Penn Station on the Wednesday night before Thanksgiving? It\u0027s like that scene from I Am Legend, multiplied by that scene from World War Z, divided by your happiness and raised to the power of eleventy-bajillion grumbling Garden Staters.Everything worth caring about in food, drink, and travelEven if the federal government declines to prosecute Wilson, it is highly probable that the Justice Department under a 1994 federal law will take the Ferguson police department to federal court itself. Once there, upon a showing of a pattern of civil rights violations, they can force reforms under consent decrees with federal monitors.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityUnplug, shut down, get together with friends and family face to face, and be thankful for this crazy life. That\u0027s what the holidays are about -- celebrating life and those close to us who put the color in it.Party Stylist at Evitehusband, father, photographer, writer, producer and director kenhammphoto.comWhen it comes to Thanksgiving, librarians enjoy pumpkin pie and the Thanksgiving Day Parade as much as the next person. But it should come as no surprise that for the librarians at The New York Public Library, one of the things they\u0027re most thankful for are books.Creating the library for the futureI can\u0027t speak. My country has scarred me once again. How can I go to work in the morning on a train full of people who care not? At a workplace of people who missed the story because of football or reality television?University Chaplain, University of PennsylvaniaDouble chocolate pavlova could be the ultimate sweet ending to your feast. No one will miss the pumpkin pie.Once Upon a ChefAs education becomes dematerialized, demonetized and democratized, every man, woman and child on the planet will be able to reap the benefits of knowledge. We\u0027re rapidly heading toward a world of education abundance.Chairman/CEO, XPRIZECooking is one of my favorite pastimes, but cooking a big meal without a plan can take time away from family and friends and add stress to the season.

They know that any day, their families may be torn apart. They work hard and pay taxes but the risk of being caught and deported keeps them on the fringes of society.President, Common CauseEstimates vary, but somewhere between 10 and 16 million Americans are defrauded each year in this way. Thanksgiving can be an awkward time of year for some victims, since family members account for more than 30 percent of the identity thieves.Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911Besides giving us insights, surveys and findings, can more social scientists like these few but important examples change some routines to provide strategies, tactics, and solutions that can more practically flow from their knowledge to action?Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorDecades of segregation and inequality in Ferguson, as well as most American metropolitan areas, have fostered a racial inequality exacerbated by the criminalization of not just poverty, but the criminalization of black and brown bodies. Too many whites are too willing to believe that a black body poses a threat.Director, Haas Institute for a Fair and Inclusive Society and Professor of Law, African American and Ethnic Studies at UC BerkeleyI have a neuromuscular autoimmune disease called myasthenia gravis. Like other friends of mine with MG, lupus, multiple sclerosis, and other illnesses, I have to weigh the joys of being with loved ones against the risks of getting a cold or the flu, which can lead to relapses, hospitalization, and weeks (or months) bedridden.Writer, speaker, lipstick lover.
