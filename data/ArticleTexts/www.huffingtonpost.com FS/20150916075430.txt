{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027This week marks the 7th anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the huge investment bank. This collapse set off the worldwide financial panic that brought Wall Street to its knees. The anniversary of this collapse, September 15, is the day set aside to ridicule the people who warned of a second Great Depression (SGD) if the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Board didn\u0027t rescue the Wall Street banks. Just to recount the basic story, there is no doubt that without a government bailout most of the big Wall Street banks would have gone under. There is no doubt that the initial downturn would have been more severe if the market was allowed to work its magic and put these banks out of business. But the question the SGD gang could never answer is how this collapse would prevent the government from boosting the economy immediately afterward?What Donald Trump doesn\u0027t understand is this. Historically speaking, government antipoverty programs haven\u0027t weakened the work incentive. On the contrary, welfare has provided the temporary lifeblood that Sarah, her daughter, and thousands of law-abiding citizens like them depend on, not for convenience, but for survival.Technology Analyst at R/GAIt is said of economists that they know the cost of everything but the value of nothing. In the case of the article \"Price Tag of Bernie Sanders\u0027s Proposals: $18 Trillion,\" this accusation is a better fit for the Wall Street Journal that published it.Professor of Economics, University of Massachusetts at AmherstPresident Obama must know that it is impossible to protect the Arctic while allowing Shell to drill for oil 70 miles off the coast of Alaska. He cannot have it both ways. His policies and proclamations are irreconcilable.Founder and Chair, Bianca Jagger Human Rights FoundationFor workers like me, $15 an hour means being able to feed my family without worrying that we\u0027re taking money we need for the gas or water bill or for bus passes. It means being able to see my kids grow up. It means real change in our lives.KFC employee, Fight for $15 advocateWe just witnessed the embarrassing results of the last US attempt to train Syrians: only few completed the training, and once they reached Syria, they were ambushed, shot, kidnapped, or went missing.Professor of international relations, George Washington UniversityThe military cemeteries of the United States, whether on American soil or foreign shores, contain the remains of men whom war has taken from their families. Any loss of a life is a tragedy, but the unfulfilled human potential that perishes as a result of war is doubly so.Author, \u0027Dangerous Ground\u0027The most amazing -- and decidedly Christian -- thing Francis has done since ascending to the papacy is his not-so-subtle attempt last week to welcome divorcees back to the church\u0027s fold. The move not only shows signs of a warmer, gentler Church, it also embraces and (literally) legitimizes people like me.Writer, TV Journalist, Mom of FourI also have images from Macedonia burned into my mind. We experienced absolute horrors there. We were carted in a train to the Serbian border. We couldn\u0027t move, and had to wait -- anxious and afraid -- for many hours. We were like animals in a cage.17-year-old from Damascus, SyriaFrom neighborhoods to states, from the suburbs to the city, and from farms to factories, people are blazing a clean energy path to economic growth and greater equality.Oscar-nominated actor, climate change activistA four-year civil war has forced more than half of Syria\u0027s population to neighboring countries or other parts within it. While big NGOs have issued aid appeals, smaller relief organizations tend to operate with lower overhead costs so more of your money can directly support those in need.Blog Editor, The Huffington PostSanders should learn from what happened with Black Lives Matter. A candidate can\u0027t rely on people knowing what he\u0027s done in the past and needs to both speak about that past record and about what he\u0027s going to do right now.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostThere are so many fatal flaws in President Obama\u0027s recently unveiled New College Scorecard it is difficult to know where to begin our nation\u0027s imperative critique. For starters, how shocking it is to see that our educational leaders housed within the U. S. Department of Education could prove so inept in collecting, interpreting, and providing our president reliable data.President, Carson-Newman UniversityRepublicans know they can\u0027t beat Hillary fair and square. All they can do is hope to confuse and exhaust enough Democrats who lose their nerve and chicken out when it comes to refuting false attacks on her.Founder, Media Matters for AmericaThe purpose of the penal system is social rehabilitation, according to the ICCPR. In contravention of that mandate, the California legislature has specified that the purpose of sentencing is punishment. Solitary confinement implicitly denies any chance of social rehabilitation.Professor, Thomas Jefferson School of LawAs proud as I am to discuss my heritage, I was constantly put down in school for claiming to be \"something I\u0027m not.\" My light olive-colored skin is all that people needed to know to slap a label on me and call me white. I wanted so badly to represent the culture I held so close to my heart in a physical way, but I couldn\u0027t.Actress/SingerWhat else don\u0027t our elected officials know? And should we be concerned? More important, can we do anything to ensure that our representatives are informed on important issues?Psychologist; Journalist; College ProfessorI\u0027m not obsessed with Burning Man, I don\u0027t spend my whole year planning for it, I don\u0027t have a playa name, and I don\u0027t think of it as my \"home.\" But I do think the culture it has created is amazing and impressive, and I\u0027m bothered by how much people are missing the forest of values preservation for the trees of commercial intrusion. Founder, ClimateTruth.org / Director CEL Climate LabAfter six years of silent preparations, the Obama White House has recently unveiled some bold diplomatic initiatives. As these moves unfold, Obama is revealing himself as one of those rare grandmasters who appear every generation or two with an ability to go beyond mere foreign policy and play that ruthless global game called geopolitics.Professor of History at the University of Wisconsin-MadisonThe second debate of the Republican nomination race is fast approaching, so in preparation I thought it would be a good time to take a look at the entire GOP field once again. First, though, a word about the debates themselves.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comAs we remember on September 15, please pause to know that for many, justice forgot. Maybe this year we can work to change the philosophy that is still at work in our nation that produces hate and murder.Pastor / Writer / MomLet\u0027s pay close attention to what happens in Europe in the wake of two events of major importance: the Greek crisis, with the attendant risk of failure of the Euro area, and the refugee tragedy, which has reached massive proportions against a backdrop of growing populist, demagogic, xenophobic, and racist tendencies.MEP, President of Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European ParliamentThis is a critical moment for people who care about psychedelics to bring their voices to the table. The drug policy landscape has changed as quickly as any other issue in U.S. politics over the past few years.Director of Communications Strategy, Drug Policy AllianceI\u0027m tired of it because, at best it silences women and keeps their voices out of the pulpits and the classrooms. At worst it traps women and girls in abusive and damaging situations, and fuels a culture of male privilege and power.Pastor, Wife, MotherA review of Israel\u0027s detention policy reveals how outrageous and convoluted the legal system behind this policy is. Israel maintains a perpetual state of emergency as a political tool to provide the legal rationale, however twisted, for the policy of continuing administrative detention.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUThe U.S. will arrive with its strongest-ever commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, with a proven record of success over the past decade, and with a Clean Power Plan from the EPA that can get us all the way to a 30 percent reduction in emissions and beyond. We\u0027re not alone, either.Executive Director, The Sierra ClubThe record industry is a mere shadow of its former self (apt punishment for its cowardice), and CD\u0027s and vinyl albums have almost become \"novelties\" in a world driven by downloads. Yet, the warning labels still adorn individual track listings and albums online.rock star, radio show host, actor, writer, television personalityI was naive, scared and broke yet determined to enhance my foreign language studies. Looking back, it amazes me that I even made it through the process of getting there, however, it can certainly be done.A place to find useful information from the people who\u0027ve been there. Learn from others. Adult together.The genie cannot be put back in the bottle and wars cannot \"unhappen\". Yet besides the humanitarian help which decency dictates should be offered to refugees, the resort to diplomacy instead of war would also help millions of people now fleeing their countries and trying to make a new life elsewhere.Professor, l\u0027Université Paris Ouest NanterreBy Tony Abbott\u0027s reckoning there are two main culprits in the growing toxicity of the Australian landscape -- poll-driven politicians and a \"febrile\" media that \"rewards treachery.\"Editor-in-Chief, HuffPost AustraliaThe SDGs and Universal Declaration should be a packaged deal. At UNGA, leaders will commit themselves to the former. But for that commitment to bear fruit, they must also rededicate themselves to the latter.President, Robert F.
