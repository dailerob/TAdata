{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027Much has happened since, including the rise and decline of the Religious Right, which, all the surveys show, caused many people to turn away from faith because of their attempt to turn religion into right-wing politics and judgment against so many people. Those in the Religious Right were ultimately defeated when they lost their own children -- literally. Traveling and speaking on the road, I often meet young, disaffected evangelicals or religiously unaffiliated (some from the families of Religious Right organizations) wanting to talk. They don\u0027t want to talk about politics but about how to save their faith from all the disillusionment and betrayal they feel.Comments (21)TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"Cute, precious... brilliant? You bet. Behind that adorable facade, your baby is performing complex calculations in an effort to figure out how exactly this crazy world of ours works.Comments (23)Michael KimmelAuthorRemember Howard Beale? Played by Peter Finch in the movie Network (1976), the deranged former TV news anchor Beale tries to generate a social movement by admonishing viewers with a simple sentiment: \"I\u0027m mad as hell and I\u0027m not going to take it anymore!\"Comments (449)Johnny JetTravel ExpertA few minutes after touchdown, we did indeed have a water canon salute, which I\u0027d previously only experienced on happy occasions like inaugural flights. This time, the water glistening on the windowpanes looked like tears.Comments (25)Martin ScorseseDirectorIt\u0027s impossible to separate the power of Dean\u0027s presence and his extraordinary impact on teenage viewers (like me) from the fact that his two key pictures were made in color and Scope, which was being used for the first time by Elia Kazan (in East of Eden) and Nick Ray.Comments (21)Rebecca SearlesSocial Community Editor, The Huffington PostMisusing the label and sounding like an idiot isn\u0027t good for anyone. So, I made a simple flowchart to make it easy on you.Comments (194)Elizabeth H. Bradley, Lauren A. Taylor and Aly MooreOver the past several decades, and particularly in the Affordable Care Act, we have focused on reforming health care payment schemes, medical provider networks, and health care insurance regulations, while virtually none of the legislation addresses the powerful, non-medical determinants of health.Comments (17)Kimberly K. Arcand and Megan WatzkeWe\u0027ve put together a group of our favorite selfies of someone that could actually use more face time: Mother Earth.CommentsMarian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundFifteen-year-old Davion Navar Henry Only has spent his entire life in Florida\u0027s foster care system. He\u0027s been moved from placement to placement throughout his childhood. For some children like Davion, foster care can last an entire childhood.CommentsJohn GlaserEditor at Antiwar.comThe national security state should no longer be able to get away with exploiting public fears about monsters from abroad to justify repression at home. There is no \"balance\" to be struck between liberty and security when the security justification is so obviously counterfeit.Comments (25)Marguerite WilsonVisiting Assistant Professor, Department of Human Development at Binghamton UniversityNot everyone shares the Western assumption that children should have an extended, protected childhood. The circumstances of life in different parts of the world create different assumptions about what childhood should look like.CommentsAlexandra RosarioBlog Editor, The Huffington PostPeople are downright fascinated when I tell them I\u0027m about to marry a chef. Celebrity chef culture is so pervasive in this country; chefs are today\u0027s new rock stars, wielding Japanese knives instead of electric guitars. It all looks so fun and glamorous. Right?CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThe deficit is down 6 percentage points of GDP since 2009 -- the largest four-year decline since 1950. We\u0027re engaged in a level of budget austerity that would make a European policy maker proud.Comments (234)Brett GallaherFounder, WeOccupyJesus.orgJesus would send out an emergency text to his homegirls to come rescue him. He\u0027d stall in the meantime: \"Mark, I\u0027m really flattered that you\u0027ve devoted your entire ministry to me. That means a lot. Tell me more about what attracted you to Christianity.\" Mark would lean over and whisper two words in Jesus\u0027 ear: \"Real. Men.\"Comments (13)David WildTV Writer; Contributing Editor, Rolling Stone; Co-Author, \u0027Everybody\u0027s Brother\u0027In recent years, I\u0027ve grown tired of hearing people who would classify themselves as music lovers offering vaguely snide comments about rap and Hip hop artists making the grade in the Rock \u0026 Roll Hall of Fame.CommentsOff Track PlanetThe Independent Travel Lifestyles Guide for the Young, Sexy and BrokeBeds are made for sleeping.

Try your luck at getting laid at some of these places from all around the world.Comments (26)Tulani ElisaOptimist, opportunist and lover of all things social.We\u0027re not accustomed to being wanted. Lusted after, yes. Fantasized about, no doubt. Objectified, without question. But wanted, loved, dreamed for? Not so much. This, is why black women love Scandal. Everything about it is against how we\u0027re usually depicted on TV and in movies.Comments (94)Susan Katz MillerAuthor, Being Both: Embracing Two Religions in One Interfaith FamilyThis time of year, many interfaith families are preparing to feast on latkes, light Hanukkah candles at the Thanksgiving table and then move on to making Christmas cookies. But beyond holiday celebrations, is it a good idea to raise kids in two religions?CommentsRep. Debbie Wasserman SchultzAuthor, \u0027For the Next Generation\u0027; Chair, Democratic National CommitteeIf we strive to understand the challenges that teachers face and empower them to improve flawed policy, we will get so much more from our investment in their salaries. Forcing teachers to compete against one another for better scores on a standardized test is not the way to improve education.Comments (176)Mike RyanSenior Entertainment Writer, The Huffington PostThere has been a lot of doom and gloom surrounding the development of Episode VII as of late. There have been rumblings for awhile that J.J. Abrams hasn\u0027t been the happiest of souls thus far, as production crawls along. Last week\u0027s departure of screenwriter Michael Arndt (who wrote the first Episode VII treatment and script) only added fuel to this already explosive story.Comments (59)Martha BurkMoney Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsOn one of the issues that polls highest with American women -- pay equity -- we sink even lower, to 67th, right below Yemen. We did beat out Saudi Arabia at 111th, no doubt because women in the U.S. are allowed to drive to work.Comments (68)Russell SimmonsFounder, GlobalGrind.comMy question for you, New York Times, is how can you allow such strong voices such as corporations that promote war, destroy the environment, lobby for assault weapons, etc., and yet take issue when those that fight for animals give them a voice?Comments (13)RoadtrippersDiscover Your AmericaA couple weeks ago, Albuquerque, New Mexico held its 41st annual International Balloon Fiesta. It\u0027s a nine-day event where over 700 balloons see liftoff. It\u0027s the largest hot air balloon festival in the entire world and we were on hand to capture the action.CommentsDoug BandowSenior Fellow, the Cato InstituteAttention in Washington recently focused on the government shutdown. But a far more important issue confronts America while the president and congressional leaders dither: rising chocolate prices. When will the government address this terrifying global crisis?Comments (50)Peter GrayResearch professor of psychology, Boston CollegeThink of it; none of these characteristics are present in our standard schools. In our standard schools we deprive children of the conditions they need to educate themselves, and then we try to teach them something.CommentsVirginia SullivanAuthor, First Class WomanI can still remember where I was sitting the day that my daughter called me and told me she was expecting. I had moved to New York with my second husband and my two younger children. I remember the feel of the phone against my ear, the sound of the happiness in her voice, the curtains that decorated the windows.CommentsJonathan KimGentleman farmer, film critic for ReThink Reviews and the Uprising ShowAs a newcomer to the series, I found myself much more interested in the film\u0027s take on leadership, the military, war, and empathy for one\u0027s enemy.CommentsJay WinstenAssociate Dean, Harvard School of Public HealthAt any given daylight moment across the U.S., approximately 660,000 drivers are using electronic devices. In 2011, 3,331 people lost their lives and 387,000 suffered injuries in crashes involving a distracted driver.Comments (16)Theo RandallChef, restaurant ownerThis is a really good way to use Italian sausages. They have lots of flavour as they are a mixture of cured and fresh pork. By taking them out their skins you have an instant mince which can cook very quickly. The addition of a tablespoon of cream just finishes of this sauce perfectly.CommentsLarry StraussVeteran high school teacher and coach, writerShould there even be high school football? Just asking that question is probably an affront to players and their fans at every level. But I\u0027m asking because the question needs to be asked. Because don\u0027t we put student safety above all else?Comments (24)Lester \u0026 CharliePolitical satiristsWe\u0027re relieved to hear that former child star Britney Spears isn\u0027t twerking or going on homophobic rants or getting drunk or becoming a go-go boy.
