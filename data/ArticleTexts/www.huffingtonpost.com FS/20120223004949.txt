What\u0027s become apparent to me is that the rate of change on this planet, due to technological, ecological, and financial mechanisms, is the highest it\u0027s ever been. That means that our rate of adaptation must also be high, that we must adapt our communities, companies, and selves to what is quickly becoming a new and different world. We must experiment, or die.Read Post | Comments (56)Robert Reich, 02/22/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Aftershock\u0027Why isn\u0027t the White House just proposing to close the loopholes without reducing overall corporate tax rates? That would generate more tax revenue that could be used for, say, public schools.Read Post | Comments (174)Ellen DeGeneres, 02/22/12Animatrice, \u0027The Ellen DeGeneres Show\u0027The Oscars are this Sunday, and I have a feeling The Artist is going to do very well. It\u0027s nominated for 10 awards, and if I hadn\u0027t lost all my money on the Super Bowl, I\u0027d be placing my bets.Read Post | Comments (17)Jared Bernstein, 02/22/12Senior Fellow, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesPretty much every discussion of tax reform these days ends with an agreement that we need to broaden the base and lower the rates. Well, the White House today will release the broad outlines of a plan to do just that on the corporate side of the federal tax code.Read Post | Comments (84)Margaret Cho, 02/22/12Comedian, actor, and recording artistMy former bullies pay extra to come backstage and meet me after shows, and I pretend not to know them in front of their friends. It is the most divine pleasure to exact the revenge of the brutalized child that resides within.Read Post | Comments (31)Dennis A. Henigan, 02/22/12Acting President, Brady Campaign; Author, \u0027Lethal Logic\u0027The solution to gun trafficking to Mexico is also the solution to gun trafficking within the U.S.: stronger federal gun laws.Read Post | Comments (51)Arianna Huffington, 02/21/12With unemployment still over 8 percent, we currently have more ingenuity, energy, and expertise than we have jobs -- and definitely more time on our hands. That\u0027s one reason I was so drawn to Abundance, a new book by Peter Diamandis and Steven Kotler.Read Post | Comments (104)Howard Fineman, 02/20/12Editorial Director, AOL Huffington Post Media GroupIn spite of the ever-deepening flood of candidate advertising, politics (and journalism) today are do-it-yourself, web-based and socially-connected enterprises. Which is where you come in.Read Post | Comments (67)Mike Lux, 02/21/12Co-founder and CEO, Progressive StrategiesThere is simply no way to read the Bible I read and not come to the conclusion that it is overwhelmingly supportive of helping the poor, showing mercy to the weak, refraining from judging, and all kinds of other liberal, lefty, progressive values.Read Post | Comments (1,520)Michelangelo Signorile, 02/22/12Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay Voices; host, \u0027The Michelangelo Signorile Show\u0027 on Sirius XM\u0027s OutQIt\u0027s amazing how coming out of the closet has propelled Sheriff Babeu to publicly espouse a whole other brand of Republicanism than the one he was embracing just days ago. It\u0027s just one example of how the closet corrupts -- and how coming out liberates.Read Post | Comments (14)Trey Ellis, 02/22/12Novelist, Screenwriter, and Associate Professor at Columbia UniversityWhat\u0027s Master doing with my crate?

Gottlieb, 02/22/12Professor of Philosophy, Worcester Polytechnic InstituteSantorum\u0027s virtual ignoring of environmental issues may be correct or incorrect, depending on your point of view. But it is not orthodox Catholicism -- at least not the morally, politically and spiritually serious Catholicism of 2012.Read Post | CommentsRoger Smith, 02/22/12Inventor, raconteur, star of the show that’s on after \u0027Family Guy\u0027Here is my interview with Terry Bates of Action 3 News about why I\u0027m running for president.Read Post | CommentsTiphani N. Montgomery, 02/22/12#1 Essence Magazine Bestselling Author, Motivational Speaker, Business CoachI did some reevaluating of my life and realized that the reason I was failing at everything I touched was because it wasn\u0027t in my destiny to do them. So I made the decision to live my life according to what was going to make ME the happiest.Read Post | Comments (30)MJ Rosenberg, 02/22/12Senior Foreign Policy Fellow, Media Matters Action NetworkPresidents need latitude to make decisions affecting matters of national security (another name for matters of life and death) and, until now, all presidents have been afforded it, as provided for in the United States Constitution. But, in the case of Iran, the rules are changing.Read Post | Comments (35)Evan Shapiro, 02/22/12President, IFCConsider what is now reality -- television is an important way to expand your talents, extend your career and rid yourself of cubas (named for the epitome of the post-Oscar slump, Cuba Gooding, Jr.).

Elisberg, 02/22/12Screenwriter, columnistThe only thing galling about Pat Buchanan getting fired by MSNBC is that he\u0027d been hired by them in the first place.Read Post | Comments (19)Maer Roshan, 02/22/12Our nation\u0027s seemingly ravenous appetite for drugs also raises problematic questions about the larger culture the media has helped create. Why is it that a nation that enjoys one of the highest standards of living in the world also suffers one of the highest rates of drug abuse?Read Post | CommentsSuleika Jaouad and Seamus McKiernan, 02/22/12If it takes a village to raise a child, you might say it also takes one to care for the sick. Cancer is at once personal and communal. And yet, caring for the sick can feel like writing a travelogue about a country you\u0027ve never visited. You can\u0027t know where you haven\u0027t been.Read Post | CommentsLaurence Watts, 02/22/12Freelance journalist and founding member, Servicemembers United\u0027s Campaign for Military PartnersRead Post | Comments (107)Dee Evans, 02/22/12Political Junkie and Chamber of Commerce ExecIt would be interesting to know what the thought process was behind the decision not to have the first black president participate in the shovel part of the ceremony for the first national museum dedicated to African American history; heck, Obama is African American history!Read Post | CommentsAlaa Al Aswany, 02/22/12Best-selling Egyptian author and columnistTrue religion requires us to defend human values: truth, justice and freedom.
