{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor of Literature, Yale UniversityThe Israeli election falls exactly two weeks after Netanyahu\u0027s visit to Washington. How then can we avoid interpreting his speech to Congress as an attempt to merge the interests of the Republican Party and Benjamin Netanyahu? The Republican Party carries a banner that reads \"United States\" and Netanyahu carries a banner that reads \"Israel.\" His acceptance of the invitation is thus several things at once. It is an attempt to disrupt a process of international negotiations in which the US and Europe have been deeply involved. It is an exercise of brazen electioneering to promote his continued leadership of Israel itself. And it is a calculated insult to the sovereignty of the United States.Far from falling back into line and yielding to terror, tens of thousands of Russian men and women, in the manner of the French who so recently proclaimed \"Je suis Charlie,\" came out to shout \"I am Boris\" into the ears of Vladimir Putin, who has never faced an adversary as vibrantly alive as this newly dead man.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.Female recruits are promised a wonderful husband and a free house with top-of-the-line appliances, such as a fridge, microwave and even a milkshake machine.Professor of Security Studies, University of Massachusetts, Lowell; research fellow, Center for Terrorism and Security StudiesDoes it have to be Hillary?

And while I think that polite words and gentle hearts make the world go round, what changes the world, what also matters, is confidence.Author of Kindness Wins, a simple no-nonsense guide to teaching our kids how to be kind online.Republicans in Congress have been saying for five years now that their top priority is to \"repeal and replace\" Obamacare. The problem, however, is that they are now scrambling to come up with something (anything!) that would help convince John Roberts to vote against the ACA.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comA fight is coming because past trade deals have cost jobs and wages, devastated entire regions, and accelerated corporate power and income/wealth inequality -- which it is becoming clear was the intent.Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureThis may be one of the most transparent public killings of our time, and yet evidence is hard to come by. Nemtsov was shot four times in the back. Even when there is a smoking gun, there is no smoking gun. In the absence of facts, the speculation about possible culprits says far less about reality than it does about the speculators\u0027 worldviews.Professor of Russian \u0026 Slavic Studies, New York UniversityProven, science-based protocols worked for me, and it has worked for hundreds of my colleagues who have returned from this and past Ebola outbreaks without infecting anyone.Associate Professor of Medicine at Columbia University Medical Center, Attending Physician in Emergency Medicine at New York-Presbyterian Hospital in New YorkA TBI changes you. Literally and figuratively. My personality is different. My energy levels and sleep patterns are foreign to me. The confused woman in the kitchen staring at the oven is someone I am just now starting to understand.Professional Photographer, Creative Business Coach, Writer, Traveler, life lover, TBI Survivor, and mommy to a rescue YorkieIn acting upon the Expert Group\u0027s report, Norway has a problem. Not only is the Fund\u0027s immense wealth derived from North Sea oil, the Norwegian Parliament controls Statoil, one of the largest oil companies in the world. These facts pose a dilemma. They also offer Norway a unique opportunity.Former SEC CommissionerThe federal budget is a reflection of our nation\u0027s priorities. As the budget debate heats up in Washington, Congress must choose between investing in a safe and economically secure America, or siding with special interests and continuing to spend billions on wasteful programs that military leaders do not even want.Ohio State Senator, 15th District; Exec. Dir., Multiethnic Advocates for Cultural Competence; chair, WAND Education Fund Board; CNHC, Inc. (board member)Here\u0027s a little secret that might surprise meat-eaters: Vegetarians like to eat more than just salads. We like a nice hearty sandwich as much as the next person. We like salty, cheap food, too. And we\u0027d eat a lot more of that stuff if only fast food restaurants were willing to sell it to us.Animal Welfare Editor, The Huffington PostEvery tweet, interview, Facebook post and letter speaks to Kelly\u0027s willingness to not only pursue peace but to minister to other inmates, sharing hope and light from a place of internal resilience.Minister, Writer, Community Developer.According to some of my friends who are athletes in Special Olympics, when they hear the word \u0027retard\u0027 being used in that context, they feel hurt, anger, sadness, disgust -- and I even heard \"It\u0027s like a knife cutting into my heart.\"Special Olympics athleteTerrorist ideology can\u0027t be \"killed\" like a person. It must be diluted and weakened through means other than physical force. Before an ISIS terrorist kills innocent human beings, he\u0027s brainwashed into doing so by extremist propaganda.Columnist, journalist, and author published in The Hill\u0027s Congress Blog, The Jerusalem Post, Salon.com, and other publicationsWe cannot raise awareness about the heroines and heroes of history, and then turn around and be cowards 50 years later. This Congress must deal with overt moves among states to obstruct people\u0027s right to vote, and they must restore federal protections of voting rights.President, National Action NetworkThe recent decision of the Board of Governors of the University of North Carolina to close the University of North Carolina Law School\u0027s Center on Poverty, Work and Opportunity is a blatant and dangerous instance of political interference with academic freedom.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoWe Americans usually reserve the more kindly word \"patriot\" for ourselves and use \"nationalist\" to diss other people who exhibit special feeling for their country. In the extreme, it\u0027s \"superpatriot\" for us and \"ultranationalist\" for them.Editor, TomDispatch.comEven the President admits there is reason to be skeptical based on past trade agreements. This time let\u0027s read the 1,200 pages before we write a blank check based on wishful thinking.President, Communications Workers of AmericaNina Teicholz, author of The Big Fat Surprise, wrote an op-ed in The New York Times entitled \"The Government\u0027s Bad Diet Advice.\" Unfortunately for Times readers, the op-ed was packed with errors and distortions.Executive Director, Center for Science in the Public InterestBut you would never know it if you listened to the cries coming from key members of Congress and hawkish D.C. think tanks. It is important to note that these substantial proposed increases in Pentagon spending are arbitrary numbers cherry-picked from past Pentagon five-year plans, not careful assessments of current defense needs.Director, Arms and Security Project, Center for International PolicyHigh school students across New Mexico walked out en masse this morning to protest the start PARCC testing, which began Monday morning.Executive Director, ProgressNow New MexicoThe ALEC drill team was on full display this week.

Bush has forfeited the right to march. He does not get to partake in such a solemn and sacred time in our history that moved us forward as a nation when all he did was set us back.Associate Professor of History at Montgomery CollegeOnly the United States has the means, the will and the mentality to contemplate the kind of military engagement that could shift the terms of the current equation. What the Obama administration might do once it realizes that its present disjointed efforts are unavailing, though, is unpredictable.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghPurposeful Pauses don\u0027t add time to your schedule, so why not make them a habit? What you notice may astound you.Founder and Executive Director, Institute for Mindful LeadershipMrs. Hughes and Bates will get quietly married, then be not-so-quietly arrested for conspiracy in the death of Mr. Green, then get exonerated by the King.Author, reviewer, and bloggerTexas lawmakers are gunning for the judge who let two lesbians to get married. Meanwhile, homophobic lawmakers celebrate the 10th anniversary of the state\u0027s marriage ban.
