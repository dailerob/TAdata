{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027With the economy just barely on a path to durable recovery, some very dumb fiscal chickens are coming home to roost on January 1 of next year. First, the legacy of last summer\u0027s ill-fated bipartisan fiscal bargain -- an automatic set of budget cuts totaling $1.2 trillion -- kicks in next January 1. Second, President Obama\u0027s temporary payroll tax cuts expire. And third -- this is a good witch -- all of President George B. Bush\u0027s tax cuts sunset. The trouble is that all of this adds up to a massive fiscal contraction. If you want to snuff out a fragile recovery, there is no better way than to cut spending and otherwise shrink the federal deficit prematurely.Read Post | CommentsGreta Van Susteren, 04/01/12Host of Fox News\u0027 \u0027On the Record with Greta Van Susteren\u0027Yes, of course the president wants his signature health care law upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, but I suspect that it would help him politically if the statute were to be struck down in its entirety.Read Post | Comments (356)Penn Jillette, 04/01/12Bestselling author; Larger, louder half of Penn \u0026 TellerIt was this week\u0027s episode of Celebrity Apprentice where Donald Trump and Clay Aiken understood that they didn\u0027t understand me, and feeling misunderstood by Donald Trump and Clay Aiken is it\u0027s own kind of joy.

No one else will ever trade these bonds to any significant degree.Read Post | CommentsAbby Huntsman, 04/01/12PR and media professionalNo one can help but to speculate on how a 5-4 verdict against the law might impact the general election. From my perspective, I\u0027ll be relieved that we can now remove the popular and overused phrase \"Repeal Obamacare\" from the GOP vernacular.Read Post | CommentsMitchell Bard, 04/01/12Writer and FilmmakerThis recall election will determine whether Scott Walker continues to damage the lower and middle classes in Wisconsin, and you may, in fact, be the only candidate that can beat him.Read Post | Comments (27)Priyamvada Natarajan, 04/01/12Cosmologist, Yale UniversityThe era of America\u0027s unchallenged world dominance as a scientific superpower is coming to an end.
