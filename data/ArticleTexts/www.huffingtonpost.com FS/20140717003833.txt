We are living through the greatest macroeconomic experiment in the history of the U.S. Never was so much printed and spent by so few. And I continue to believe that the Dow will see 5,000 before it sees 20,000.Finance professor, Chapman UniversityThe Republicans believe that suing Obama will excite and turn out their base voters, and they\u0027re betting that this benefit will be larger than any political blowback.
