{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week saw the rise of late-in-the-game Christie for President hoopla, and the dramatic, defeat-snatched-from-the-jaws-of-victory final fall of the Boston Red Sox. It also brought the start of Michael Jackson\u0027s doctor\u0027s trial (thrilling HLN\u0027s anchors, though Nancy Grace\u0027s wardrobe malfunction was caused by an energetic quickstep, not titillating testimony) and the end of Andy Rooney\u0027s run as America\u0027s favorite curmudgeon. Meeting a more final end was senior al Qaeda leader Anwar al-Awlaki, whose killing prompted Leon Panetta to offer this classic shot of wry: \"This has been a bad year for terrorists.\" Meanwhile, the Occupy Wall Street protests intensified, a welcome reminder that, for angry Americans, the Tea Party is not the only option -- and that the energy for real change will definitely come from outside Washington. Keep your eye on Zuccotti Square.Read Post | Comments (69)Alec Baldwin, 9/26/11ActorWe don\u0027t need the death penalty. Life in prison without parole is the worst possible sentence. Have you ever visited a prison and spoken to inmates about what goes on there? How they feel? I have. Prison itself is the death penalty. In the slowest of slow motion.Read Post | Comments (1,449)Marlo Thomas, 9/26/11Award-winning actress, author and activistHard to believe now, but 45 years ago my character, Ann Marie, was the only girl in town.

This time the office has to seek someone serious, and whoever that person is, has to come out of the closet soon.Read Post | Comments (251)Arianna Huffington, 9/26/11In the absence of jobs and a strong economy, voters at least want someone who speaks boldly about his plans to turn things around. It\u0027s not about the left or the right or the center, nor being smart or being reasonable. It\u0027s less about the brain and more about the lizard brain.Read Post | Comments (602)Van Jones, 9/30/11President of RebuildtheDream.com and author of NY Times bestseller, \"The Green-Collar Economy\"Wall Street has long been the home of the biggest threat to American Democracy. Now it has become home to what may be our best hope for rescuing it.Read Post | Comments (2,060)Lance Armstrong, 10/2/11Founder and Chairman, LIVESTRONGFifteen years ago, soon after I began treatment and long before I knew if I would survive, I received an email from a cancer patient that said, \"You don\u0027t know it yet, but we\u0027re the lucky ones.\" I didn\u0027t understand it immediately, but I do now.Read Post | Comments (20)Sen. Claire McCaskill, 9/30/11U.S. Senator from MissouriAcross the country, Social Security and Medicare are an integral part of sustaining millions of seniors\u0027 health and dignity.

In some ways, I think they\u0027re trying to tell me that thanks to the film, they now get it.Read Post | Comments (571)Rep. Keith Ellison, 9/27/11Co-Chair, Congressional Progressive CaucusInstead of supporting legislation to solve the jobs crisis, right-wing pundits and politicians are encouraging this gloom by claiming America is in \"decline.\" These critics are cynical and wrong.Read Post | Comments (187)Nelly Furtado, 9/29/11Mother, singer-songwriter, record producer and actressMy thoughts immediately went back to a concert I performed as part of a celebration thrown by someone described as an \"oil sheik\" in Italy in 2007. That night, I met a \"son of Gadhafi\" who had helped pay for the celebration. I didn\u0027t know much about Libya then.Read Post | Comments (47)Dylan Ratigan, 9/28/11Host, MSNBC\u0027s \u0027The Dylan Ratigan Show\u0027; Author, soon to be released \u0027Greedy Bastards\u0027Until we get money out of our politics we can\u0027t address the corrupt structures that prevail over health, energy, education, defense, trade and banking.Read Post | Comments (188)Desmond Tutu and José Ramos-Horta, 9/25/11While we believe that both historically and in today\u0027s \"wired\" world it is futile to suppress the quest for knowledge, there are many in Iran whose lives are being threatened or damaged by that regime\u0027s attempt. They need our support.Read Post | Comments (267)Marian Wright Edelman, 9/30/11President, Children\u0027s Defense FundOur child poverty statistics are morally and economically indefensible. Is this the best America can do? Is this the reflection of our values as a nation?Read Post | Comments (113)Kal Penn, 9/27/11Actor/ProducerProgress is possible with a leader who understands what\u0027s at stake.

Presidential elections are coming and the role of \"the evangelicals\" is predictably becoming a hot political story. Ironically, voices on both the right and the left want to falsely describe most evangelicals as zealous members of the ultra-conservative political base.Read Post | Comments (318)Marcus Samuelsson, 9/27/11Chef; AuthorRead Post | Comments (15)Bill Gates, 9/27/11Co-chair of the Bill \u0026 Melinda Gates FoundationThe numbers don\u0027t lie.
