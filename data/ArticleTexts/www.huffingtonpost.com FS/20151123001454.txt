{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, as the death toll in the Paris attacks climbed to 130, the rhetoric in the U.S. turned ugly. Even though all the attackers identified so far were European nationals, American politicians were vying to see who could shut the door on Syrian refugees the hardest. On Thursday, the House voted to add more requirements to what is already an arduous process. Even worse was Jeb Bush\u0027s suggestion that perhaps refugees should have to prove that they\u0027re Christian, or Donald Trump saying we might have \"no choice\" but to shut down mosques. Marco Rubio went one step further, saying \"it\u0027s about closing down any place\" where \"radicals are being inspired.\" Even as Americans continue to stand with Parisians, our leaders seem ready to abandon our principles. What the terrorists are attacking is openness and tolerance - giving them exactly what they want seems like a very odd way to fight them.Contrary to Hillary Clinton\u0027s statements in the most recent Democratic debate, Muammar Gaddafi was not \"deposed.\" He was tortured and murdered, very likely by Islamists allied with NATO forces. The \"radical elements\" that are causing \"a lot of turmoil and trouble\" in \"this arc of instability\" are, in fact, Islamists whom Clinton picked as allies in the region, and she has pressed to supply them with arms in Syria as well as Libya.Professor of Literature, Yale UniversityNo is powerful. It\u0027s a big weapon to have in your arsenal. But it is a very tough weapon to deploy.Creator and Executive Producer of Grey’s Anatomy and Scandal and Executive Producer of How to Get Away With MurderI\u0027m disappointed in you, Governor Snyder, for your heartless and un-Christian actions, and for joining in with at least 25 other governors who\u0027ve decided to block legal Syrian refugees from coming into their states. What you\u0027ve done is anti-American. This is not who we are supposed to be.Oscar and Emmy-winning Directorif you\u0027re thinking about adopting a child, remember that it\u0027s a gift you\u0027re getting and it comes with just as much responsibility as if you had your child biologically. On top of that, it\u0027s a beautiful blessing that you were chosen to take care of this child and become his or her parent.Emmy and Tony Award-winning actress and singerIf you cherry-pick scientific truths to serve cultural, economic, religious or political objectives, you undermine the foundations of an informed democracy.Author, \u0027Space Chronicles: Facing the Ultimate Frontier\u0027#PorteOuverte is about open hearts, open minds, open arms and open doors. What we\u0027ve seen these last few days by U.S. politicians has been a shameful subversion of that spirit: closed hearts, closed minds, clenched arms, barred doors.Host/Producer, HuffPost LiveI don\u0027t really care one way or the other whether Princeton erases Woodrow Wilson from its history - except to the extent that such an action would inevitably invite an endless array of similar claims that would both fundamentally distort the realities of our history and distract attention from the real issues of deeply-rooted injustice in our contemporary society that we need to take seriously today.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoAfter tragedies like this, when there are votes to be gained, who cares about the facts or about basic human compassion?Actress and authorFear is toxic to a democracy. Fear divides. Fear overreacts. Fear discriminates. It\u0027s a lesson we\u0027ve learned throughout our history, from the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 to the imprisonment of Japanese Americans during World War II to the post-9/11 Patriot Act.Executive Director of the American Civil Liberties UnionThe most difficult thing that is left to be done after this massacre is to understand what is happening to us, to conceptualize the hate that is enveloping us, to conceptualize the profound threats looming over our democracies.Editorial Director, Le Huffington PostFor over thirty years we\u0027ve treated something as fact which is actually false. Economists we trusted to know better didn\u0027t, and so people have suffered and continue to suffer. This pernicious economic myth is the idea that a rising yacht lifts all tides, or as more popularly described, \"trickle-down economics.\"Writer and basic income advocateWhen Donald Trump said he would not rule out special identification cards for Muslims, I got the chills. It took me back to when I was a child, and I learned that Jews were forced by the Nazis to wear the Star of David on their clothing.Senior Member of the Senate Foreign Relations CommitteeWe cannot tolerate intolerance and violent extremist views that are unwilling to accept co-existence with others different from themselves. These extremists are the minority in our society, but unfortunately those who are practicing active tolerance are also in the minority. There are too many of us sitting in silence, unable or unwilling to take action.Founder and Chairman of Generations For PeaceSpiritual seekers should not be infantile, fuzzy-brained, naive observers merely standing on the sidelines with nothing to contribute but loving hashtags while the world community faces an unprecedented crisis. Quite the opposite, we should be major factors in healing the crisis.AuthorIn the United States, the immigrant story is part of the blueprint of our country. It disheartens me to see my community or any other culture under attack. Some presidential candidates do not seem to care that by promoting negative stereotypes, they are alienating one of the biggest voting blocs in America.Actor and activistRussian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev may have been hoodwinked by his close friend in the biggest scandal to hit the art world in decades.Contributing editor, Vanity FairImperial Washington is so caught up in its myths, lies and hegemonic stupidity that it can not see the obvious. And that is why a quarter century after the cold war ended, peace still hasn\u0027t been given a chance; it is the reason why horrific events like last week\u0027s barbarism in Paris still keep happening.Author, \u0027The Great Deformation: The Corruption of Capitalism in America\u0027During Obama\u0027s time in office, his administration has taken no action to actually rebalance the system so candidates are accountable to ordinary Americans, not just wealthy special interests. As the president enters his final 14 months, he would do well to consider how history will remember him on this issue.CEO of MAYDAY.US, Associate Law Professor at Fordham, Corruption ScholarRI State Representative, Former Congressional Candidate, Demand Progress Exec DirectorOf the four doctors who worked on me, not one had mental health screenings in place for their patients, except for asking if I had a history of depression, which I said I did, and that was that. None of the doctors suggested I consult a psychologist for what was clearly a psychological issue.Actor, StudentShaming the oil and gas industry might very well be a good thing to do, but it is not an academically good thing to do. Saving the world from fossil fuels is not a pedagogical goal and doesn\u0027t belong either in the classroom or in the mission statement of a university.Davidson-Kahn Distinguished University Professor and Professor of Law at Florida International University; Floershimer Distinguished Visiting Professor of Law at Cardozo Law SchoolWith greater investment in alternative energy innovation, strong political will within Africa and outside its borders, and an end to endemic corruption, Africa could become a leader in sustainability, lighting the way for all of us.Director of Development and Correspondent, Seeker NetworkWe must not send those fleeing persecution back to their persecutors. The definition of moral courage is to resist allowing fear to overwhelm our humanity.Director of Immigration Policy, Niskanen CenterOf course we\u0027re thinking about Paris. Do we really -- each and, it seemed, every single one of us -- need to repeat the same trite words or post the same stock photos to prove as much? Is it not enough to just feel anymore, without taking to social media to put those feelings on display?Author, research psychologist and gender scholarTrump\u0027s outrageous idea of creating a Muslim database, Carson\u0027s ridiculous comparison between Muslims and dogs, Bush\u0027s Christian litmus test for Syrian refugees, and Cruz\u0027s politicization of the issue are all empowering ISIS. The terrorist attacks in France were horrific. But Americans should not react out of fear.Hofstra Journalism ProfessorMake life easy on yourself this Thanksgiving -- and avoid being a frazzled host -- by selecting dishes that are easy and/or make-ahead. When your guests arrive, you\u0027ll be ready to celebrate rather than slaving away in the kitchen or, worse, nodding off at the table.Chef, Recipe Developer and Busy MomTo win the \"war\" against ISIS, we must win the moral narrative -- we must reveal ISIS\u0027s distortions and lies and thus destroy their moral and religious legitimacy to those they seek to recruit. The best way to defeat bad religion is with good religion, and the better way to defeat religious fundamentalism is from within rather than trying to smash it from without.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersI thought about the intertwined recent histories of our two countries and how much the French really loved the Americans, which made me all the more ashamed of the Republicans under George W. Bush who ridiculed that country and its people.Professor, historian, authorUnfortunately, for many of us, we\u0027ve been exposed to so many unhealthy relationships in our lives that we don\u0027t know what a truly healthy relationship even looks and feels like. So here are 10 characteristics of a healthy relationship:Self and relationship coach, teacher, and writer. Founder of JenniferTwardowski.comIn 1939, some 900 Jews fled Germany aboard a cruise liner. They had hoped to reach Cuba and then travel to the United States and safety. But when they arrived at the Florida coast, they were forced to return home. In the end, 250 of those on board were ultimately killed by the Nazis.Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersToday\u0027s students\u0027 equating of hurt feelings with scarring wounds is a departure that leads to dangerous overreaction. When unwelcome ideas are decried in the language of pain and injury, the impulse to suppress them -- rather than to challenge and debate them -- can be irresistible.Executive Director, First Amendment CoalitionGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
