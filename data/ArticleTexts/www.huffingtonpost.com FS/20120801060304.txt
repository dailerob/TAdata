{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"I\u0027m delighted to announce the launch of HuffPost Canada Impact. Impact has always been a key part of HuffPost\u0027s DNA, and our goal of starting conversations and inviting our readers to connect, engage, and make a difference in the lives of others is perfectly captured by HuffPost Canada Impact\u0027s motto: \"One story can spark a flame, one person can make a difference.\" As HuffPost continues to expand internationally, and as our ability to connect and engage with others becomes less and less constrained by borders, we believe Impact has tremendous potential to helps us all widen the circle of our caring. In Canada, there\u0027s no better time than now to use all the tools at our disposal to widen that circle.Read Post | Comments (16)Cenk Uygur, 07/31/12Host, \u0027The Young Turks\u0027Romney\u0027s deeply offensive comments about the Palestinians probably won\u0027t hurt him in the election at all.

But when talking about gay, straight, or anything else, the principles of how we want to teach our kids to live are the same as any other discussion about growing up right: Practice kindness and love and treat others as you\u0027d like to be treated. Plain and simple.Read Post | Comments (109)Sec. Kathleen Sebelius, 07/31/12Secretary of Health and Human ServicesWomen\u0027s health decisions shouldn\u0027t be made by politicians or insurance companies.
