{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"APFrom de.wikipedia.orgAPFrom theage.comFor Bush administration members not facing indictment, it\u0027s never too soon to contemplate unemployment. But with sand in the gears of Tom DeLay\u0027s K Street project, and with too many lickspittles chasing too few \"Republican Strategist\" chyrons on cable tv, the job picture is looking pretty bleak for soon-to-be-former White House staff and Cabinet types. The traditional recourse for newly-minted exes is to write a political memoir, but if the sales of Ari Fleischer or Karen Hughes are any guide to the future, the chances of getting a publisher to pony up more than pin money are slim. Into this gloom now shines the blinding smile of OJ Simpson. He\u0027s writing a book called \"If I Did It, Here\u0027s How It Happened.\"READ POST | comments (15)11.15.2006 Bob CescaDemocrats have a very real opportunity to fix this madness: our Constitution, our liberties and our democracy are bogged down in a quagmire spawned by the same consummation of tools who brought us Iraq.READ POST | comments (12)11.15.2006 Rep.
