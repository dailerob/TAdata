{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Author and Fellow at the Century FoundationA Democratic president is in trouble. He is seeking a second term in the midst of a grim economic crisis -- one of the worst ever to hit the United States. The average unemployment rate is an astonishing 16.9%. The jobless number amounts to six to eight million people. A conservative Supreme Court has invalidated some of his most important measures to deal with the economic collapse. Few observers give him much of a chance. Yet he goes on to win in a landslide. That president was Franklin Delano Roosevelt; the year was 1936.Read Post | Comments (264)Peter Diamandis, 07/13/12Chairman/CEO, X PRIZE FoundationWho is going to solve this problem? Government?

He can\u0027t tout the last GOP president\u0027s record because it was terrible. He can\u0027t tout recent GOP policies because they\u0027ve all been negative.
