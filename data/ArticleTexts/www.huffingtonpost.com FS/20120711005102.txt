{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"HuffPost Live, our new live streaming network, is launching August 13. One of our goals is to create the most social video experience possible. That\u0027s why we\u0027re putting you, the HuffPost community, front and center in everything we do. And since we want you be real partners in what we are building, we\u0027ve created \"HuffPost Live 3, 2,1...,\" a section that will help us find out what kind of network you want to be a part of -- and which of our community members want to join us live on the air as regularly featured guests. The first step is going to \"3, 2, 1...\" and recording a video sounding off on what you are passionate about. HuffPost Live aims to be as disruptive in video as HuffPost has been in the way news is consumed and engaged with. But we can\u0027t do it without you. So check out \"HuffPost Live 3, 2, 1...\" and join the conversation.Read Post | Comments (231)Marlo Thomas, 07/10/12Award-winning actress, author, and activistWhen most people think of Alan Alda, a smile of recognition comes to their faces because they recall the hundreds of memorable roles that he\u0027s played.Read Post | Comments (42)Drew Westen, 07/09/12Professor, Departments of Psychology and Psychiatry at Emory UniversityPresident Obama\u0027s latest tax cut announcement is more bad messaging. When you throw out an arbitrary number as your cap for tax cuts, you immediately get off message and into the weeds. Why? Because your number rapidly becomes contested.Read Post | Comments (652)Lisa Belkin, 07/10/12Senior columnist for Life/Work/ Family, The Huffington PostThe message sent to the 12-year-olds on the field at Britt David Park in Columbus was that winning matters so much it is worth fighting over. I\u0027m betting that is the same message that the 16-year-old cheating Stuyvesant students were sent over the years.Read Post | Comments (66)Keli Goff, 07/10/12Author, Commentator and Contributing Editor, TheLoop21.comHistorically, Americans don\u0027t seem to trust a man whose hair always looks that perfect, whose shirts always look that starched and whose wife claims they never fight. When voters can\u0027t see flaws it leaves them to imagine or invent them.Read Post | Comments (143)Arianna Huffington, 07/09/12We cannot overestimate the devastating human consequences of our unemployment crisis. But we also must not miss out on spotlighting what is working. That\u0027s the belief behind the new jobs section we\u0027re launching today, Opportunity: What Is Working.Read Post | Comments (617)Glenn W. Smith, 07/10/12Writer, campaign manager, activist, think tank analystTexas Gov. Rick Perry is turning the state\u0027s health care system into the equivalent of a deadly carnival dunking booth. Taxpayers will be forced to buy mandatory tickets to guarantee that some of their neighbors drown.Read Post | Comments (86)Alex French and Howie Kahn, 07/10/12On July 1, 1987, WFAN, a 24-hour sports talk radio station, broadcasting out of a sub-basement in Queens, hit the air. It didn\u0027t come out of nowhere, exactly. The format had been evolving.Read Post | CommentsHoward Fineman, 07/09/12Editorial Director, AOL Huffington Post Media GroupYes, it is unrealistic and predictable. It is preachy and takes place in a galaxy long ago and far away. In other words, it is a fairy tale. Well, fairy tales are meant to inspire and instruct, and The Newsroom manages to do both in a mostly entertaining way.Read Post | Comments (112)Reince Priebus, 07/10/12Chairman, RNCWhat do Finnish cars, Mexican solar panels, and Danish windmills have in common? They were all funded by your tax dollars.Read Post | Comments (590)Jennie Ketcham, 07/10/12AuthorLuck landed me my first job out of pornography, working as a hostess for $10/hr, with a wonderful boss and no judgment. And it was luck that brought the man I love into my life.Read Post | Comments (43)Rev. Jesse Jackson, 07/10/12Civil rights activistThis economy is not working for most Americans. With hard-hit families tightening their belts, employers won\u0027t hire until they see a lot more customers with cash in their pockets.Read Post | CommentsAnn Brenoff, 07/10/12Senior Writer, The Huffington PostTell me more about what it was like back then, my son urged. Well, I never rode in a car seat as a baby, I told him. In fact, my mom held me on her lap, juggling me and a cigarette at the same time.Read Post | Comments (42)Robert Reich, 07/10/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Everyone is treated exactly the same. Everyone gets a one-year extension of the Bush tax cut on the first $250,000 of income. No \"class warfare.\" Yet regressive Republicans want Americans to believe differently.Read Post | Comments (348)Taylor Cole Miller, 07/10/12Doctoral student in Media and Cultural Studies, University of Wisconsin - MadisonTrue Blood has always and probably will always have a socio-political agenda. For these \"anti-vampire white trash,\" the face of Obama himself has become the \"big bad\" who is to be feared for the devastation and chaos he will surely leave in his wake.Read Post | CommentsDr. Peggy Drexler, 07/09/12Author, Research Psychologist, Gender ScholarLet\u0027s put aside the more commonly-asked question these days -- that is, should you be Facebook friends with your children -- and get down to a much more basic quandary: Can you be real life friends with them?Read Post | Comments (192)Lillian Daniel, 07/10/12Author, \u0027When \"Spiritual But Not Religious\" is Not Enough: Seeing God in Unexpected Places, Even the Church\u0027Here\u0027s one: You find yourself asking the clergy to take all the references to Jesus out of the service.Read Post | Comments (66)Paul Abrams, 07/10/12Last person on Earth not on FacebookHouse Republicans are planning a vote to repeal Obamacare.

She\u0027s a goofy kid sister but with an edge. She must be disappointed to start this coveted, high profile job under uncomfortable circumstances, but she never cracked under the scrutiny.Read Post | CommentsBlake Danford, 07/10/12Anti-bullying activist and member, Youth Empowered to Act (YETA)As an openly gay student, I have faced adversity in many forms, from students and school administrators alike. Bullying from students is common, but when it comes from the administration, it becomes downright dangerous.Read Post | CommentsRabbi Shmuley Boteach, 07/10/12Rabbi and WriterOrdinarily, an attack by a political hack of one party about a mega-contributor to another would not merit comment. But what made David Harris\u0027 vitriol most unfortunate was that it was one Jew deriding the two foremost private supporters of Jewish identity in the entire world: the Adelsons.Read Post | Comments (58)Richard Florida, 07/10/12AuthorThe tectonic upheavals our economy is enduring are the result not just of ?nancial shenanigans by the global One Percent, but of a deeper and more fundamental shift -- the passing of the old industrial order as it gives way to the emerging Creative Economy.Read Post | CommentsJoseph Bobrow, 07/10/12Founder and president, Coming Home ProjectAs important as getting a job is for veterans, I\u0027m not sure we take the time to consider the factors that support finding, getting, and keeping a job: Being successful on the job.Read Post | CommentsMichael Rossmann, SJ, 07/10/12Jesuit scholastic (Catholic seminarian)Sure, pop music seems to have little in the way of ... umm ... depth. The question is whether God is present even in what can seem to be vacuously superficial. Can what initially appears to be a cheesy song be a way to imagine God singing sweet nothings to you?Read Post | Comments (96)Richard (RJ) Eskow, 07/10/12Writer; host, \u0027The Breakdown\u0027; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureThe problem isn\u0027t a shortage of scandalous stories. We\u0027ve seen a lot of those. What we haven\u0027t seen, at least here in the United States, is a single indictment of a senior Wall Street banker from the United States Department of Justice.Read Post | Comments (123)Leslie Lagerstrom, 07/09/12Proud mom of two children; advocate for families with transgender and gender-variant kidsWhen your child is transgender, do you err on the side of full disclosure, thereby risking rejection, or do you proceed without exposing your child\u0027s biology, because it really shouldn\u0027t matter, right? Such was the case when Sam went to camp for the first time as a boy.Read Post | Comments (58)Sharon Sacks, 2012.20.07Chuck Wolfe, 2012.10.07Richard L. Revesz and Michael A.
