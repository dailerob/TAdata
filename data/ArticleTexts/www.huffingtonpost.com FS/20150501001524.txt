So why hasn\u0027t Obama done anything about it?Senior Writer, Union of Concerned ScientistsOn the one hand, we lift up and celebrate the non-violent legacy of Dr. King.

Hillary has been non-committal to date, with many assuming she will eventually support the president whom she served as Secretary of State. But now the pressure to take a stand is growing.President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureHe\u0027d get on the back of a jet ski and point that box at me while I surfed, or fell.

It is time for us, as Americans, to exercise our responsibility as citizens and take control of the debate.Author; Professor of history, Stanford UniversityBERLIN -- Tsipras squandered Greece\u0027s opportunity, because he and other Syriza leaders were unable to see beyond the horizon of their party\u0027s origins in radical opposition activism.
