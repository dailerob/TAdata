{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027The debate about immigration reform has been very productive in America over these past several years. And that debate has been won -- by those who favor a common sense agenda for reform. There are really few policy debates left on this issue, except about details. There is no real substance behind the opposition to reforming what mostly everyone agrees is a broken and brutal system. Rather it is politics: angry politics, fearful politics, and, sadly, racially-based politics, with institutional political practices and rules that can avoid democratic accountability. That is just wrong. Democracy is being vetoed by corrupt and racial politics. It\u0027s not just our immigration system that is broken -- our politics are too.Comments (41)TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"Are people who do physically demanding, not-afraid-to-get-dirty jobs like farming, mining and sheep castration (yes, you read that right) the happiest people on earth?Comments (161)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarParents have nosed around in their kids\u0027 lives ever since the invention of the telephone, but these days, technology has taken the spying game to an entirely new level with multiple points of entry, from Facebook and Twitter to Instagram, Vine, and Tumblr.CommentsMatt WalshBlogger, talk radio host, father of twinsThat\u0027s our entire economic system: buy things.
