{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Europe is right on the edge of another downward lurch into prolonged deflation. GDP growth is hovering right around zero. Germany, as an export powerhouse, continues to thrive, but at the expense of the rest of the continent. The euro, which keeps sinking against the U.S. dollar, is now trading at just $1.20, its lowest level in four and a half years. Unemployment outside prosperous Germany remains stuck at over 12 percent. All of this weakens the political center that supports the EU, and increases the appeal of far-right parties. So what does Europe have left? It is a mark of the delusion of Europe\u0027s leaders that the EU is putting its chips on a trade deal with the U.S. -- the so-called Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. TTIP is not really a trade deal at all but a series of measures intended to promote further deregulation of economic, financial, health, labor, safety, privacy, and environmental protections on both sides of the Atlantic.Mr. Fahmy has been imprisoned for over a year in a case that shocks the conscience of many observers in Egypt and abroad. We look forward to working constructively with the Egyptian and Canadian authorities in the coming days to reach an agreement for his release as soon as possible.LawyerLawyerGreece is on the cusp of a historic change. SYRIZA is no longer just a hope for Greece and the Greek people. It is also an expectation of a change of course for the whole of Europe.Leader of the opposition in Greece, president of SYRIZAThink of someone you admire -- a talented artist or scientist, entrepreneur or adventurer. Do you know what their great regret in life is? What advice would they share about parenting, or aging, or finding fulfillment? What book has had the greatest impact on their life? Chances are you don\u0027t know. Which is why we\u0027ve created Sophia.Senior Editor, The Huffington PostI am learning that the less I worry about the way we divide up the heavy lifting of being married, the more I feel like it seems pretty fair. And it feels like we can give and sacrifice with less effort and to take with less guilt.Mother, Writer, Student. Sometimes funny fat girl at parties.The truth is the Internet of Things has yet to deliver on its promise. While there are a few great integrated experiences today, many products still have their own discrete applications that are just too complicated to use or to connect to. As a result, few devices really talk effectively to anything else.Founder and CEO, JawboneAmerica just celebrated the season of giving with Hanukkah and Christmas presents, year-end charity donations and soup kitchen volunteering. It is a time when Americans demonstrate the generosity, caring and kindness that define them as a people. Now, however, Americans may suffer the season of GOP taking.International President, United SteelworkersYou\u0027re having a fabulous work day. You\u0027re on your second cup of coffee. You\u0027re breezing through your to-do list. And you\u0027re feeling awesome!Award-winning writer, communications strategist, entrepreneurAre we just another part of nature, doing what nature does: reproducing to the limits of environmental capacity, after which we will suffer a population crash?Writer and broadcasterIn the brave new world envisioned by pundits, we will all be micro-entrepreneurs with personal brands -- each of us controlling our own destiny, selling our services into digitally enabled markets. Traditional employers and wage slavery will be extinct.John L. Weinberg/Goldman Sachs \u0026 Co. Visiting Professor at Princeton University\u0027s Woodrow Wilson School and Adjunct Lecturer at the Harvard Kennedy SchoolThis woman looks like my mother. She sounds like my mother. She smells like my mother. There is that visceral feeling when I hug her, that I am hugging the woman I came from, the woman of whom I am a piece, a rib. But each time she opens her mouth, I find that she is just an echo.Writer, artist, performer, vintage seller, Bar Method teacherWhat is feared today is not the loss of any particular country to foreign conquest, but the loss of an imagined entity that binds us together. The Occident is a central piece of our mental maps and our cultural inventory. In a very visceral sense, Europeans are seized by fears of decline and by memories of cultural blossoming. Those fears culminate in the belief that our cathedrals will eventually turn into mosques, that their bells will fall silent and will be replaced by the cries of the muezzin.Founder and publisher of The EuropeanKoch-backed organizations and foundations are at the forefront of the anti-Common Core campaign, which is not surprising. What is surprising is that Koch money is going to the other side in the Common Core war as well.Social studies educator, Hofstra University, my opinions, of course, are my ownIf their names were Clinton and Kerry, or Hagel and Susan Rice, what would Rush Limbaugh have said about their failure to protect America?Columnist, journalist, and author published in The Hill\u0027s Congress Blog, The Jerusalem Post, Salon.com, and other publicationsThe trial of former CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling, set to begin in mid-January, is shaping up as a major battle in the U.S. government\u0027s siege against whistleblowing.Author, \u0027War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death\u0027While it is true that dark currents once flowed through our questions about who we come from, darkness is not integral to the activity.Author and journalistSome people think 13 is a lucky number, and some say the opposite. When it comes to the fresh faces in the Senate, this particular number 13 is likely to be very unlucky for women.Money Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsIf the United States is frustrated by the Palestinian turn toward the ICC, then it has only itself to blame for its unwillingness to halt Israel\u0027s colonization and occupation of Palestinian land.Policy Director, US Campaign to End the Israeli OccupationUnless lawmakers can be made to understand the critical role these and other educational professionals play in contributing to schools in which we can all be confident and proud, then many of these positions will remain in jeopardy to the detriment of the students and communities they serve.Historian, professor, education activist and author of Teaching US History Beyond the Textbook (2008)The Cuomos, father and son, remind us of the power of public service and the need to couple principles and ideals with pragmatism and the exercise of power and authority.Executive Director, Columbia University\u0027s Earth InstituteIt\u0027s called a basement and my kids play video games there. This basement does not have a wine cellar, a scullery, or a little room where someone shines my husband\u0027s shoes and darns my boys\u0027 Nike Elites.Author of women\u0027s fiction (ON GRACE and THE BALANCE PROJECT: A NOVEL) and Founder of The Balance Project interview series.My personal opinion on all this: the change in the scoring rules is an effort to smooth the way to \"tax reform\" and the less we hear about \"tax reform\" in this Congress the better.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorYou might not realize it immediately but one day you\u0027ll see it for what it is. You grew, evolved and moved on. You faced setbacks and dealt with them on your own. You overcame obstacles, beat back the naysayers and you have the scars to prove it.Writer, blogger, expat, and travelerAmerica is the richest country in all of history. We have the largest economy and the largest number of millionaires and billionaires. At the same time, however, we lead the developed world in economic inequality.Author, \"How to Make a Million Dollars an Hour\" (Wiley 2013)Despite fulfilling all my New Year\u0027s resolutions of 2014, I couldn\u0027t help but feel slightly under-accomplished as I approached the quarter-life mark. Digging deep I realized it was partially due to the myths I maintained about youth and love and life.Media maker, social entrepreneur and teapot enthusiastIf Uber can come up with market designs that allocate scarce perishable resources in real time more efficiently and make people happier, that\u0027s applicable in a lot of areas and worth far more than the taxi industry they\u0027re disrupting. It\u0027s a hundreds-of-billions of dollars type of problem.Founder, StreetEYE.comLet us not forget that transgender is an umbrella that encompasses all persons whose authentic identity does not conform unambiguously to conventional notions of male or female genders and assigned gender at birth. Male and female are increasingly being presented as two distinct states, with nothing between.Musician, writer, social justice activist, social media guruWhen I was younger and felt, as I often did, that I had been the victim of some injustice, my father used to tell me a parable. He would start telling it, and I would roll my eyes. Because I\u0027d heard it before, and teenagers often roll their eyes. But I also liked the story, and I always enjoyed my father telling it. So I listened.Writer and toddler-wrangler at Becoming SuperMommyI interview Ryan Phillippe, director and star of the self-satirizing thrillerCatch Hell, about Clint Eastwood, why you should never sleep with a cop\u0027s girlfriend, why comedians get away with murder, and why hedge fund people don\u0027t care that you\u0027re a movie star.Writer, musician and television personalityNotwithstanding a much more accurate national title setup, the College Football Playoff still must go one step further. An 8-team tournament is still a far better option and might have possibly gifted us a different title game, but we\u0027ll never know.Host, PacWest MagazineYoga isn\u0027t just about pretzel shapes and handstands, it\u0027s about recognizing and nourishing the light that resides within.Author, \"Yin, Yang, Yogini\"Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"WHITE HOUSE LOWERS THE BOOM ON SCALISE",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
