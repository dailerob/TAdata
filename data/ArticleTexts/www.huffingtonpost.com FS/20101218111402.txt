{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Everyone loves a good storyline, but after an election day in which the GOP made decisive gains, your media storytellers found themselves down a narrative cul-de-sac at the very moment they needed to shift their focus toward the excitement and melodrama of the 2012 presidential campaign. What to do? Where to go? Well, those questions have all been answered now that the tax cut compromise package deal has been sealed. President Barack Obama\u0027s political comeback is underway! And he only had to break a campaign promise to be relevant again.Read Post | CommentsGordon Brown, 12.17.2010Former Prime Minister of the United KingdomAmerica must now lead and ask the world to agree on a modern Marshall Plan that coordinates trade and macroeconomic policies to boost global growth.Read Post | CommentsRobin Lakoff, 12.17.2010Professor of linguistics, University of California, BerkeleyThe left likes to argue to the head; conservatives know that the further down you go, the more persuasive you will be.Read Post | CommentsCliff Schecter, 12.17.2010Best-selling author, public-relations consultant, pundit, bon vivantWhen you take America\u0027s vast wealth gap, combine it with the Orwellian \"Newspeak\" so pervasive in our media, and multiply that by the NRA\u0027s mission to increase access to guns, you have a toxic stew, ready to erupt.Read Post | CommentsMike Lux, 12.17.2010Author, The Progressive Revolution: How the Best in America Came to BeThe Big Banks Bonus Bonanza report makes the case strongly for an economic play that would give the country a far bigger economic boost than anything Obama is going to be able to get out of Congress in the next two years.Read Post | CommentsDavid J. Skorton, 12.17.2010President, Cornell UniversityThe recession we are experiencing is not a normal, cyclical \"blip\" -- it is unlike anything that most of us have ever experienced. Consequently, we in higher education have to make some fundamental changes in the way we do business.Read Post | CommentsTimothy Karr, 12.17.2010Campaign Director, Free Press and SavetheInternet.comAs so many in Congress take their cues from powerful phone and cable companies, it\u0027s refreshing to see several representatives go against the grain to take a principled stand on behalf of Internet users.Read Post | CommentsJoel Derfner, 12.17.2010Author, ComposerThe problem I\u0027d had when I sat down to write an \u0027it gets better\u0027 piece, was that I\u0027d had it so easy as a gay kid. I was pretty fey, but I was never the target of constant bullying.Read Post | CommentsDaniel Sokatch, 12.17.2010CEO, New Israel Fund (NIF)When dozens of Israeli ultra-Orthodox rabbis signed a formal edict prohibiting Jews from renting or selling real estate to non-Jews, the ensuing uproar was reassuring to those of us working for a democratic, pluralist Israel.Read Post | CommentsMarielena Hincapié, 12.17.2010Executive director, National Immigration Law CenterWe have invested in DREAMers with a K-12 education, but stop them short of fully contributing to our society. Our own irrational laws restrict the return we can see on our investment. America deserves better. We can do better.Read Post | CommentsMichael Moore, 12.17.2010Oscar and Emmy-winning directorThe tactic of using a rape charge to go after minorities or troublemakers, guilty or innocent -- while turning a blind eye to clear crimes of rape the rest of the time -- is what I fear is happening in the case of Sweden and Julian Assange.Read Post | CommentsBruce Fein, 12.17.2010Author, \u0027American Empire: Before the Fall\u0027The boast of American exceptionalism betrays ignorance of the Founding Fathers and the tarnished history of the United States. In any event, to overlook faults because other nations are more flawed is juvenile, and leads nowhere.Read Post | CommentsPamela Redmond Satran, 12.17.2010Developer of nameberry.comNow that Americans have started following the British lead and using two middle names, the Brits have to do us one better by using three.Read Post | CommentsLarry Flynt, 12.17.2010Publisher of Hustler magazine and free speech advocateLet\u0027s get something straight: Julian Assange is a journalist. You can argue he is not practicing journalism the way you think it should be practiced, but he\u0027s a journalist nonetheless. And for many of us he\u0027s a hero.Read Post | CommentsRichard (RJ) Eskow, 12.17.2010Consultant, Writer, Senior Fellow with The Campaign for America\u0027s FutureBrooks is smart, and he\u0027s a good salesman, so his ideas may resonate with the President. That would be a very bad thing indeed. He\u0027s using new catchphrases to dress up some very bad, very old, and very unpopular ideas.Read Post | CommentsRobert L. Borosage, 12.16.2010President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureYou can\u0027t fault the president for showing a little love to America\u0027s corporate leaders, but there is one small problem here: The entire premise of the meeting is wrong. What is good for General Motors or General Electric or IBM is no longer necessarily good for America.Read Post | CommentsArianna Huffington, 12.15.2010When it comes to WikiLeaks, much of media has planted its flag on the wrong side of the secrecy battle. The government\u0027s legitimate need for secrecy is very different from the government\u0027s desire to get away with hiding the truth.Read Post | CommentsMark Joseph, 11.16.2010Producer, author, talk show host and editor of Bullypulpit.comI\u0027m one of the few people who\u0027ve had the good fortune to turn the tables on Larry King by interviewing him and it remains an unforgettable experience.Read Post | CommentsLaura Ziskin, 12.17.2010Co-Founder of Stand Up to Cancer/Producer of the Spider Man FranchiseIn learning about the courage of one amazing couple, we are forced to ask ourselves, \"Would I marry someone I knew was terminal?\"Read Post | CommentsLes Leopold, 12.17.2010Author, \"The Looting of America\"Here we are in December 2010 having a debate about \"tax reform\" that hasn\u0027t even touched on a financial transactions tax and a tax on hedge funds.

Luis Gutierrez, 12.17.2010Congressman representing Illinois\u0027 4th District in ChicagoSenators, stand with those immigration opponents who defend the deportations and stonewall the DREAM Act if you want to -- but you better enjoy it while you can.Read Post | CommentsCarlo Strenger, 12.17.2010Chair of the Clinical Graduate Program of the Department of Psychology, Tel Aviv UniversityIsrael needs the two-state solution not to please the gentiles, but because of Jewish values, and the lessons of Jewish history.Read Post | CommentsDave Pell, 12.16.2010Author, Tweetage Wasteland: Confessions of an Internet SuperheroThe friending, the liking, the status updating: sooner or later we all grow to hate it, but we can\u0027t stop.Read Post | CommentsAri Melber, 12.17.2010Correspondent, The NationThe arguments of former loyalists like Graham-Felsen are striking because they not only appeal to the idealism of the Obama campaign, they also press blunt warnings about the president\u0027s political survival.Read Post | CommentsJohann Hari, 12.17.2010Columnist for the London IndependentIf you block the right to protest, you block the path to progress.
