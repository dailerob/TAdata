{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOI\u0027m thrilled to announce the launch of HuffPost Impact, our new section devoted to service, causes, and giving back. This section holds a special place in my heart. It\u0027s an idea I\u0027ve been pursuing in one form or another for over 15 years. Back in 1993, I pitched the idea of creating C-SPAN 3, a channel devoted 24/7 to the work of nonprofit groups and giving back. I pictured people being able to tune in at any time and see programming that moved them, and inspired them to take action. That was before I recognized the power of 24/7 engagement made possible by the Internet -- so that with a click and a link we can not only learn all about a cause but also immediately take action... and make an impact. That\u0027s what we\u0027re launching today. Check out HuffPost Impact -- and get involved.Read Post | CommentsBIORep. Jane Harman and Rep.
