Chief among them is that though Bin Laden is dead, others will plot to attack the United States. We will need more men like the SEALs who answered the call in Abbottabad last May.Read Post | Comments (335)Arianna Huffington, 08/31/12This week\u0027s double issue of Huffington arrives in the brief lull between the conventions.

Granholm, 09/01/12Former governor of Michigan; Host, \u0027The War Room\u0027 on Current TV; columnist, Politico; faculty member, UC BerkeleyThis past week, self-glorification trumped common national vision.

Borosage, 08/31/12President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureFor all the talk about \"introducing\" Romney to America, Romney has to remain an enigma. He can\u0027t talk honestly about the economic calamity that Obama inherited because he champions the very policies that led to it.
