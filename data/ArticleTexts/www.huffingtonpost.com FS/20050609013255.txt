{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AriannaThis is definitely not your father\u0027s anti-war movement. Unlike Vietnam, opposition to the war in Iraq is not being driven by the \"make love, not war\" crowd. Indeed, a growing number of conservative voices are being raised -- and asking whether the ongoing disaster in Iraq is draining precious resources from the war on terror (remember that?) and efforts to secure the homeland. So this is not war vs peace; it\u0027s war vs security.The most surprising of these voices belongs to Mr. \"Freedom Fries\" himself, Rep. Walter Jones (R-NC). After being a staunch supporter of the war, Jones recently voted for the Woolsey Amendment, which calls on President Bush to develop an exit strategy as soon as possible. Is Jones -- along with fellow anti-war conservatives such as Rep. Howard Coble, Bill Buckley, and former Rep. Doug Bereuter -- like the canary in the coal mine?Read More06.08.2005 Joseph NyeWe should not aim for hard or soft power, but to combine the two as a \"smart power.\" That is what we did in the Cold War. Our hard military power helped to deter Soviet aggression while our soft power ate away the basis of communism behind the Iron Curtain. When the Berlin Wall came down, it was under hammers and bulldozers, not artillery. We are failing to make that combination of hard and soft power in the so called \"war on terrorism\". We spend 450 times more on our hard military power than we do on our budget for public diplomacy (including broadcasts and exchanges). If we spent one percent, we would quadruple the expenditure for that particular instrument of soft power.read whole post | permalink | comments06.08.2005 Danielle CrittendenLIVE13 CONCERT FOR TEENAGE RELIEF Every day, thousands of American teenagers run themselves into debt. Although they live in one of the richest economies of the world, they are deprived of the most basic necessities: Playstation Portables, iPODS, cell phones, and Juicy Couture jeans. They are forced to borrow money for such necessities from their parents, or face extreme humiliation amongst their peers. Most of the time their parents will refuse to provide the necessary items or aid... By doubling allowances, canceling debt, and delivering justice to those under parental domination, Live13 could change the lives of thousands of American teenagers.read whole post | permalink | comments06.07.2005 Amy WilentzIn Haiti on Saturday, Haitian police forces raided a slum I know very well, and killed as many as 30 people. Meanwhile...5,000 miles away, the Israeli government is planning to demolish 88 houses in Silwan. The Israelis definitely have a nicer touch in executing their political operations than do the Haitians, who are using more heavy-handed, presto-destructo methods, like the Vogon Earth-destroyers in The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.read whole post | permalink | comments06.08.2005 Jay GordonThis week’s “New England Journal of Medicine,” arguably the most prestigious medical journal in America, has an article and an editorial about a new shingles vaccine for adults. The editorial supporting the vaccine’s use is written by Dr. Ann Arvin. Merck, the vaccine’s manufacturer, supplied almost all the funding for the $30 million study. So, the manufacturer funded the study of a vaccine against an illness and the NEJM allowed a consultant to that same pharmaceutical company to write an article praising the vaccine.

That\u0027s what links the Gitmo project to far worse depradations like the Gulag. FYI: the people who\u0027ve been released thus far from Gitmo have been viewed by the US military as a non-threat.

But any momentary satisfaction is replaced by acute embarrassment for poor Tony Blair, who no matter how good a boy he is can\u0027t seem to get Daddy Bush to raise his allowance.read whole post | permalink06.07.2005 Randall RobinsonJean Bertrand Aristide, Haiti’s lawful president, had been democratically elected twice, and by indisputably wide margins. On the evening of the coup’s culminating event, American soldiers in full battle gear abducted the President and his wife from their home and placed them aboard a white unmarked plane that bore the tail number of a defunct Midwestern small business. The Aristides were not at any time allowed to raise their window shades to look out.read whole post | permalink | comments06.07.2005 Andrea HarnerI recently received a text message from you kindly alerting me to my overdue bill.

We know that it took a year and a half, and the 9.11 attacks, for the president finally to accept our pre-9.11 recommendation to create a Department of Homeland Security. But few, if any, of the other 49 recommendations have so-far been adopted.read whole post | permalink06.07.2005 Rep.

And there are really really bad guys there, maybe as many as twenty. Fifteen have been designated for trial and four charged with crimes. There are three ways out of Guantanamo. The first is death -- suicide attempts are routine. The second is the court, but death is more likely. The third and best chance is if your country insists its citizens be released.
