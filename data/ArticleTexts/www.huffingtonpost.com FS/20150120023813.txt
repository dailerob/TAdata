{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Looking forward to Tuesday\u0027s State of the Union address, we are seeing a somewhat bolder Barack Obama. The White House has already pre-announced or leaked several \"fourth-quarter initiatives,\" in the president\u0027s words. Some of these can be accomplished by executive order; most will require legislation. The measures that can be achieved by presidential order include reducing the down-payment or interest on federally insured mortgages to stimulate home ownership. Among the measures requiring legislation is a tax plan that would increase taxes on the wealthiest in order to finance the tuition help for community college students and more generous child tax credits for working families. Obama also wants an excise tax on large banks and he is calling on Congress to pass a law giving all workers seven days of annual sick leave. All this amounts to a salutary whiff of class warfare, of the sort that identifies the president with most Americans, against the one percent.I first heard Dr. King speak in person at a Spelman College chapel service during my senior year in college. Dr. King was just 31 but he had already gained a national reputation during the successful Montgomery Bus Boycott five years earlier.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundFew people today know of Dr. King\u0027s opinions on issues like poverty and income inequality, or of his early support for Israel and his public opposition to the war in Vietnam. This blog post addresses some of the important contemporary domestic and international issues that I believe would be of major concern to Dr. King if he were alive today.Diversity Visiting Professor, University of San Francisco; and Scholar Writer in Residence, MLK, Jr. Institute, Stanford UniversityThe Republican establishment\u0027s leading presidential hopefuls know the current upbeat economy isn\u0027t trickling down to most Americans. But they\u0027ve got a whopping credibility problem, starting with trickle-down economics.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027In a world that considers cathedrals of stone and even the pulpit where Dr. King spoke irrelevant, what is the future of the church? We must come out of our pulpits and into the streets, into the gaps of broken relationship and broken trust. We must do the hard and beautiful work of building the beloved community.Senior Minister, Riverside ChurchEnormous profits and massive paychecks have been earned in recent times through the proliferation of complex derivative instruments and the promotion of the rapid turnover of stock and other assets. This would all change with the FTT that Van Hollen is proposing.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027If Dr. King proved anything, it\u0027s that service isn\u0027t a series of discrete acts -- it\u0027s a way of life.First Lady of New York CityDr. King\u0027s life is a reminder to seek light in darkness, to be the change itself. In this, I find much room for optimism around the world in young men and women equipped with both skills and moral courage, daring to do what is right, not easy.Founder and CEO of AcumenImagine how refreshing it would be to hear a State of the Union Address that is a list of shared goals instead of the all-too-typical wish list developed in a White House vacuum. Imagine a State of the Union in the voice not of \"I,\" but of \"we\" -- meaning we, your elected leaders.Fmr. Governor of Utah and National Chairman for No LabelsFmr. U.S. Senator from Connecticut and national honorary co-chairman for No LabelsThe plight of the New York Police Department and the city it serves provides us with an object case of what can go wrong in an America that is subjecting itself to destructive forces of its own making.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghInstead of the plodding turtle he\u0027s normally satirized as, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is all cat-on-a-hot-tin-roof about Trade Promotion Authority, better known as Fast Track.International President, United SteelworkersA man who has assimilated very well, Cohen knows the pleasures and also the loneliness of diaspora. In writing his stirring memoir, in constructing a past with which he can live, he wrestled with demons both historical and personal.President, Wesleyan UniversityThe simple truth is that murderers and presidents, and governments and groups may use the evocative power of religious language to justify their behavior. The problem is not in the language or the religion. The problem is with those who abuse it for their evil ends.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027On January 27, domestic violence survivor Marissa Alexander will walk out of Florida\u0027s Duval County jail -- but she won\u0027t be free.Editor in Chief, Truthout; Author, \u0027Locked Down, Locked Out: Why Prison Doesn\u0027t Work and How We Can Do Better\u0027Several of my favorite King quotes speak powerfully to an idea that I believe can help advance King\u0027s vision for America. That idea is large-scale, voluntary national service as a civic rite of passage.CEO and Co-Founder, City YearThis year, Dr. King\u0027s legacy is being thought of in the context of the #BlackLivesMatter movement which has spread like wildfire throughout the U.S. What we know about his legacy has been largely sanitized, re-configured, and appropriated to obscure his radical vision.Executive Director of the Black Alliance for Just Immigration, Co-Founder of Black Lives MatterThe Congressional GOP\u0027s unhealthy obsession with President Obama\u0027s use of his presidential powers has driven them into a strategic black hole, with very high, long-term costs for the party and future candidates.Univision America Host \u0026 contributor to NPR, The Hill, FoxNews Latino and other mediaMy dad was a seminary student at Yale Divinity School when the first of three Selma-to-Montgomery marches took place, in 1965. The marches led to the passage later that year of the Voting Rights Act. But a lot of blood was shed in the process.Writer, editor, momUnless the president gets trade policy right, and starts to tackle some uncomfortable truths about trading partners like China and Japan, America will be stuck with little more than a marketing campaign in place of serious manufacturing policy.President, Alliance for American ManufacturingBy standing with Memphis sanitation workers and calling on the city to treat these black workers with dignity and respect, MLK taught us that racial and economic justice are intrinsically linked. That lesson inspires me today, because 47 years later, the fight isn\u0027t over for black and Latino workers.Executive Director, Workers Defense ProjectKing was looking forward to attending a Passover Seder at Heschel\u0027s home that year, but he was assassinated a few weeks before the Jewish holiday. Heschel was the only Jew to deliver a eulogy at King\u0027s funeral service.E.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegePeople are searching for a way to transform an economic system that benefits the few over the many. They are searching for fairness, opportunity, justice and real change. I believe that search can and should lead to the labor movement.President, American Federation of TeachersPeople of faith have an important role to play bolstering and amplifying this resurgent racial justice movement to ensure the strategic demands originating in #BlackLivesMatter and Ferguson Action are translated into cultural, legislative and policy wins.CEO, Bend the Arc: A Jewish Partnership for JusticeDr. King became a martyr for peace, justice and equality. Did his life and death truly change social conditions in the United States? Or, were the federal laws associated with the Civil Rights Movement only window dressing, disguising fundamental inequalities that remain intransigent?World historian, professor at Monmouth University in New JerseyToday Oxfam announced that the combined wealth of the richest 1% will overtake that of the other 99% of people next year unless the current trend of rising inequality is checked. Inequality is spiralling out of control, but consensus on taking action against this issue of our time is gathering pace.Executive Director, Oxfam InternationalAssociate Professor in African Politics, Oxford UniversityIt seemed like a tall order to be gluten-free and eat convenient, inexpensive, healthy meals at the same time. But it had to be done. If I wanted to spend no more energy thinking about what I\u0027d eat the next day than I spent on thinking about it when I wasn\u0027t gluten-free, I\u0027d have to have a plan.Gluten free lifestyle writer. Author of forthcoming children\u0027s book.If you are ever in doubt about whether to ask some burning question, first ask yourself if you would pose the same question about the body of a non-trans youth or adult, perhaps your own child or a student or neighbor. If the answer is no, don\u0027t ask. If you find yourself biting your tongue, keep biting.Writer, editor, parentThe amazing thing about love and attention and encouragement and grace and success and joy is that these things are infinite. We get a new supply every single morning and so we can give it away all day.Bestselling Author, Carry On, Warrior and Founder of MomasteryIf you\u0027re in need of a little winter pick-me-up, this vegetarian soup is just the ticket. You can make it with ingredients you likely have on hand, it\u0027s ready in 30 minutes yet tastes like you spent all day in the kitchen making it, and it\u0027s hearty enough to be a complete meal.Once Upon a ChefOn any day of your choice, the United States, with 5 percent of the world\u0027s population, has close to 25 percent of the people imprisoned on this planet.Editor, TomDispatch.comWhile the proposal is not likely to survive, it does introduce a new dynamic into the debate on how to increase access in American higher education.
