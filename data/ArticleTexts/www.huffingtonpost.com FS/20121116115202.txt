{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Christian leader for social changeIf demographics changed this election, they have also now changed the meaning of the term \"evangelical.\" Religious right leaders like Ralph Reed, Franklin Graham and Tony Perkins did everything they could to turn evangelicals to Romney, especially in the final run-up to the election. Their efforts to turn concerns about abortion and gay marriage into partisan arguments for a Republican victory -- and to threaten dangerous consequences of a Democratic win -- were, by their own estimates, the most extensive ever. But they failed and didn\u0027t change the outcome of the election. The ironic and tragic thing about the religious right is how little of their own agenda they have achieved. And by voting for a conservative ideological agenda, they have actually hurt the poor, resisted immigration reform, promoted endless wars and neglected the environment.Read Post | Comments (814)Bob Cesca, 11/15/12Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez Show, Media ProducerI hate to disappoint the 675,000 whiny diaper babies calling for secession in the wake of the election but, sorry, no matter how hard they stomp their feet and pout and fling their feces at the electoral map, demands for secession might as well be demands for goblins and unicorns.Read Post | Comments (1,682)John Mitchell, 11.12.2012Chef \u0026 VP of Product Development, LYFE Kitchen RetailI\u0027ve had the opportunity to work with herb farmers and ingredient suppliers that have access to amazing ingredients. When I\u0027m in the kitchen experimenting with ways to create new and delicious flavor profiles, I rely on getting those flavors from herbs, spices, and vinegars. They amplify taste and can add color and texture to a meal, all with less sodium.Read Post | Comments (1)Elizabeth Warren, 11/15/12Democratic Senator-elect from MassachusettsWhen I\u0027m sworn in, I want to fight for jobs for people who want to work. I want millionaires and billionaires and Big Oil companies to pay their fair share. And I want to hold Wall Street accountable. But here\u0027s the honest truth: we\u0027ll never do any of that if we can\u0027t get up-or-down votes in the Senate.Read Post | Comments (1,752)Arianna Huffington, 11/14/12A new presidential term starts on January 21st with our country facing a myriad of urgent problems. President Obama still has the opportunity to have a transformational presidency -- but, as he has said again and again, bringing about the changes we need is going to require the active participation of all of us.Read Post | Comments (611)Laurel Dewey, 11/14/12Author, Betty\u0027s (Little Basement) Garden and the Jane Perry mystical crime thriller seriesFor those who have made the \"pot plunge\" and quit drinking, the benefits outweigh any stigma. \"I never thought I\u0027d say this but pot makes my head feel less muddled than booze,\" one woman told me, adding with a smile, \"and it makes sex incredible.\"Read Post | Comments (456)Sen. Barbara Boxer, 11/15/12U.S. Senator from California; Senior Member, Senate Foreign Relations CommitteeAs I have listened to leading Republicans denigrate Ambassador Susan Rice, I am struck by how unfair this attack is, how untruthful it is, and how at odds it is with their past actions.Read Post | Comments (184)Gabriel Sayegh, 11/14/12New York State Director, Drug Policy AllianceSaving lives should always take priority over punishing behavior. Today, Jon Bon Jovi\u0027s daughter Stephanie is alive because someone called for help. Let\u0027s make sure others know that they can and should do the same.Read Post | Comments (70)Michael Roth, 11/15/12President, Wesleyan UniversityThe goal of inquiry isn\u0027t Truth with a capital \"T;\" it is more inquiry. The goal of liberal learning is more learning. We hold onto our \"plasticity\" by holding onto our ability to be affected by others -- to learn from experience in context.Read Post | Comments (20)Robert Greenwald, 11/14/12Filmmaker, Brave New FoundationI\u0027m going to Pakistan to investigate what life is like for those living under drones. Critical questions must be asked. Do these drone strikes make the United States any safer, or are they a prime recruitment tool resulting in more militancy?Read Post | Comments (27)Dan Froomkin, 11/15/12Senior Washington Correspondent, Huffington PostIt\u0027s been 148 years since the events dramatized in Lincoln. Much has changed, but much is the same. The question now is how the tall, pensive man in the White House will use his power, and whether he will rise to the challenge of history.Read Post | Comments (48)Lisa Belkin, 11/15/12Senior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, The Huffington PostA few weeks ago, a reader who we called \"SH\" wrote to ask advice from readers about whether to go visit her dying father. He had been abusive to her mother throughout a 20-year-marriage, she wrote, and had cut all ties with his children back when SH was still in her teens. She just made her decision.Read Post | Comments (71)Doug Bandow, 11/15/12Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteThe most important vote on November 6 was not reelecting Barack Obama as president. It was legalizing marijuana in Colorado and Washington. The fight over drug policy will go on for a long time. But the Drug War is ending.Read Post | Comments (143)William Bradley, 11/14/12Political Analyst, NewWestNotes.comEasily the most dramatic sequence in a rather strong press conference performance today by President Barack Obama was his vehement defense of UN Ambassador Susan Rice against attacks by Republican Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham.Read Post | Comments (286)Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm, 11/15/12Former governor of Michigan; host, \u0027The War Room\u0027 on Current TV; columnist, Politico; faculty member, UC BerkeleyThank you, ma\u0027am, for not taking the easy way out.

Then, I dreamed of peace. Now, on the second day of an Israeli incursion into Gaza that began with the killing of Hamas\u0027 military leader, I still dream of peace.Read Post | Comments (72)David Halperin, 11/15/12Attorney, advocate, writer at RepublicReport.orgBeneath the raw offensiveness of Mitt Romney\u0027s statement to his donors that President Obama had won by providing \"gifts\" to African-Americans, Latinos, and young people, is a layer of remarkable hypocrisy.Read Post | Comments (75)John Becker, 11/15/12LGBT activist, writer, bloggerHow are the Catholic bishops in America -- so eager to engage in anti-gay politicking at home -- reacting to their Ugandan colleagues\u0027 endorsement of a bill that would bring horror, persecution and bloodshed to Uganda\u0027s LGBT community? With stone-cold silence, that\u0027s how.Read Post | Comments (63)David Bromwich, 11/14/12Professor of Literature at YaleThe largest hope of 2012 surely rests not with the president, but with those senators of political skill and passion who have been elected or reelected. They may give the party a backbone it has missed in recent years. For these are unembarrassed Democrats, none of them as immature as Obama was in 2008.Read Post | Comments (372)David Rock, 11/15/12Director, NeuroLeadership InstituteIf we are to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff arriving in 2013, President Obama could benefit from understanding what brain research tells us about building coalitions and finding agreement with people we perceive as being in our \"out-group.\"Read Post | Comments (42)Sanjay Sanghoee, 11/15/12Banker; author of thriller novels \u0027Merger\u0027 and \u0027Portrait of Malice\u0027Raising taxes on the rich, who usually pay a lower rate than everyone else because of the loopholes available to them, is not about redistribution of wealth but about creating a level economic playing field for all Americans.Read Post | Comments (144)Carl Jeffers, 11/15/12Television political commentator, radio talk show host, lecturer, political analystAnother frequent post-election question we hear is whether President Obama has a \"mandate\" with the results of this election.
