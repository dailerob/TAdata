{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghThe United States Freedom Act does not trouble Intelligence agency leaders. They have widely assumed, as admitted in private statements, that the compromise provisions merely create a few procedural inconveniences that could be circumvented or neutralized by exploiting loopholes -- no more than speed bumps. None of the Agency\u0027s core activities would be significantly affected. So there is no reason for anyone in the intelligence agencies to sweat the small stuff: a shift in the number of days the NSA can retain the sweepings of Metadata collection; or whether the data should be held at their storage lock-up or the one across the street protected by a bicycle lock and owned by a very accommodating neighbor? And who\u0027s checking, anyway -- the FBI? the FCC?Some in Europe, especially in Germany, seem nonchalant about a Greek exit from the eurozone. The market has, they claim, already \"priced in\" such a rupture. I believe that such views significantly underestimate both the current and future risks involved.Professor at Columbia University and a Nobel Laureate in EconomicsThere\u0027s been a lot of talk about the place of women in country music lately, so it seems like the perfect time for two women to host the 2015 CMT Music Awards, and with any luck whatsoever, that is what we intend to do this Wednesday night on CMT.Sportscaster, journalist, and television personalityActressSomething is rotten in the state of Michigan.

Another dissolved its public school district and replaced it with a charter school system, only to witness the for-profit management company it hired flee the scene.Author, \u0027A Dream Foreclosed\u0027An anti-ISIS conference was held in Paris on June 2. The only armed forces that, so far, have stood up to the beheaders, the only ones capable of holding a front a thousand kilometers long, the only ones that have not yielded an inch of ground -- the Kurdish armed forces, the army of the Iraqi Kurds and its heroic Peshmerga -- were not invited.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.After five years of stall tactics and changing the rules to whatever suits him, Senator Ron Johnson long ago forfeited whatever deference he feels he is owed. The president has a list of names and he should act, selecting the nominee who will best protect the rights of everyday people in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin.President, Alliance for Justice and Alliance for Justice Action CampaignHistory shows the very opposite of progress when it comes to these democratic sovereignty-shredding and job-exporting corporate-driven trade treaties -- unless progress is referring to fulfilling the deepest wishes of runaway global corporations.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorIt is often said that the economy is too simple for economists to understand. This is clearly the story with the continuing weakness of the job market and the trade deficit.

They know they have to do everything they can to silence the voices of everyday Americans because it\u0027s the only way they\u0027ll keep winning elections.President of EMILY\u0027s List and American Women\"All across the nation when they do projects like this,\" Walker said. \"It\u0027s a good deal.\" The Bucks franchise, valued at $600 million, is owned by a group of billionaire financiers in New York. But no matter what it\u0027s worth, Walker\u0027s statement is at wide variance with the findings of independent economists.Executive Vice President, Cato Institute; Author, \u0027The Libertarian Mind\u0027 (2015)Forty-two Republicans, none of whom even bothered to speak in opposition, voted to continue discrimination, and my amendment was defeated. Some of those Republicans had previously voted for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, so they retreated from their earlier stand against workplace discrimination against LGBT Americans.U.S. Senator from New HampshireFor political wonks, June is not the month to celebrate grads, dads, and brides, but instead the biggest SCOTUS month of the year. This year, the biggest two (or the two with the biggest political overtones, at any rate) will likely be held back until the very end of the month.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comWhen someone dies it\u0027s such a private time and yet so very public.

It is this ideology that leads adult white men -- police officers -- to use the kind of force we\u0027ve seen in the McKinney footage against black children.Author, blogger, and poet.When you\u0027re not paying attention to content and you\u0027re simply trying to indulge the delicate sensibilities of a society waiting to be outraged, you\u0027ve already lost.Comedian. Author. Idiot.Japan has always been Washington\u0027s number one Asian ally. That was demonstrated with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u0027s trip to Washington, highlighted by a speech to Congress. Unfortunately, the relationship increases the likelihood of a confrontation between the U.S. and China.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteCould the desire to add artistic value to the world be only human?

But we can\u0027t lie -- location matters, too.CondeNastTraveler.comFranklin Graham took to Facebook to announce he is moving his accounts to another bank to protest the Wells Fargo commercial featuring a lesbian couple.

The too-big-to-fail Wall Street banks that brought us the 2008 financial collapse and the Great Recession, the Koch brothers and their like, with their Ayn Randian \"selfishness is good\" philosophy, have sadly brought us an economy utterly dominated by the Henry Potters of the world -- except on steroids.Co-Founder, Democracy PartnersJim Bob claims that, \"This wasn\u0027t rape or anything like that. This was touching over the clothes.\" This perception that touching is somehow less traumatic than penetration is not only false, it is incredibly damaging to victims, and helps perpetuate a culture of victim-blaming.Speaker, advocate, and attorney dedicated to empowering women and ending sexual and domestic violence.
