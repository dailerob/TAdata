{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Children\u0027s Defense FundThose of us who follow Jesus\u0027 teachings and the call in every major faith tradition to care for children must act on our faith. We must see these thousands of children in need of help right now not as a political dilemma but as an urgent humanitarian crisis. We must help ensure sufficient resources are provided so these vulnerable children will be treated humanely, find safe families and warm food to eat, and receive the counsel and due process hearings guaranteed them in law before any are returned to their dangerous homelands and possible deaths. It is deplorable that Members of Congress left town for their own summer vacations with the humanitarian crisis continuing and without providing the resources the government needs to ensure safety and justice for these innocent children.Magician and New York Times crossword puzzle wizard David Kwong says we\u0027re wired to solve puzzles and make order out of chaos -- and he\u0027s got a trick to prove it.\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"With or without an infusion of massive amounts of international aid, clearing away the mess of this war will take years. Streets can be cleaned, but the wounds, both physical and mental, will not soon heal, nor will the survivors easily erase the feelings of helplessness, despair and anger with which they have been left.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Most researchers believe there are three primary motivating factors behind dating someone at work -- love, ego and job. Men do it for love. Women do it to get ahead. That\u0027s the outrageously biased way people judge office romances -- and another example of women getting a bum deal.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarEvery time the president -- this president or any president -- is allowed to \"cut corners\" on the Constitutional question of Congressional war powers, it sets a bad precedent for the future, eroding a key Constitutional, democratic speed bump against unnecessary wars of choice.Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicyPlease, for the love of all that\u0027s good and holy, stop the nonsense. We\u0027ve overcome this problem before and we can do it again. Remember saying things were \"radical\" or \"rad\"?Blogger, \"Hot Flashes of Inspiration\"I asked Jeremy Courtney for his opinion on what Christians might be able to do to help Christians on the ground in Iraq, and his answer surprised me and might surprise Christians and non-Christians alike.Executive Religion Editor, The Huffington Post\u0027ve been \"prowlin\u0027 and a growlin\u0027\" for 70 years now and sometimes you forget to take stock of the world around you. It\u0027s easy to think that what\u0027s here now will be here tomorrow, but it doesn\u0027t just happen. It takes you. Only you.Only you can prevent wildfiresOur traditions and spirituality are essential elements of our survival. As human beings we know this. Unfortunately, much of the world has forgotten.Member of the Red Cliff Tribe of Wisconsin Ojibwe; Independent writer and photographerThe president was correct in announcing humanitarian action yesterday in Iraq. He will be helping to prevent genocide. But, more than that, his announcement of limited military action, both to overtly protect US troops and installations, and tacitly support the Kurds in their fight against the Islamic State, is the correct move.Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranSexual assault is a major issue on America\u0027s campuses. The Ray Rice incident offers an opportunity for educators to express our concerns about on the assaults occurring on campuses, the questionable use of the athletic department to investigate these issues, and the need for punishment that fits the crime.President, Southern Vermont CollegeISIS has attacked the Yazidi people -- a sect of the Kurds -- in Iraq. The jihadists have driven the survivors to the slopes of Mt. Sinjar, where the Yazidi are running out of food, water and hope. Who are the Yazidi? Why is ISIS after them, why have Sunni and Shi\u0027a attacked them in the past, and why are they at risk of genocide now?Publisher, the-environmentalist.orgHe cynically fanned racism, manipulated white voters and prepared the ground for the conservative assault on civil rights, affirmative action and social programs that, in the years after his plunge to disgrace, the GOP has honed to a fine art.Author and political analystThe andropausal man and the post-menopausal woman are more alike than any other time in their adult lives. This is when, with a bit of work, they can make peace with their partners, recall shared history, experience love in a new way and make relevant how it relates to the parts of their lives that they actively care about.Founder and Chairman: The Second Half Foundation and Centre; Author, The Second Half of Your LifeThis conflict has devastated the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians, and readers of the Times require clear and accurate comparisons of data.Advocacy Director for Middle East North Africa issues at Amnesty International USA.Luckily, the two Americans who received ZMapp, the new experimental drug for Ebola, seem to be improving, which holds great promise and hope for thousands of other people but also raises broader ethical issues and questions.Professor of Psychiatry and Director of the Masters of Bioethics Program, Columbia University; author, \u0027Am I My Genes?\u0027Personally, I don\u0027t believe my tax dollars should be used to pay the salary of someone who wants to convince the world that my ultimate desire is to be able to legally molest children.WriterWomen are the ones who have elective abortions, and women (mostly) get breast cancer, so therefore, abortion causes breast cancer? Come on, let\u0027s be better than this -- correlation does not equal causation.Blogger, breast cancer survivorRather than simply dismissing the show as being blasphemous, maybe we should continue to watch with an awareness of contemporary issues and a strong sense of irony. To do so, would ask us to consider what then does it mean to have a black Jesus living and moving in impoverished black spaces?Minister, professor, scholar and public intellectualIt has been widely reported that August 9 marks the 40th anniversary of President Nixon\u0027s resignation. What has received considerably less attention is that the date also marks the 30th anniversary of the publication of what may well be the stupidest thing ever written about Watergate: an op-ed column for The Washington Post by one Benjamin J. Stein.The 25th anniversary edition of Paul Slansky\u0027s The Clothes Have No Emperor will be published this fall.CREDO commends President Obama for responding to a clear humanitarian crisis with emergency supplies. More is needed, the U.S. need not continue alone, but starting quickly while refugees are literally dying on the mountain is the right thing to do now.President, CREDO MobileYou need to say thank you. It can be a tiring place, this happily ever after. Yes, there is love and there are kitchen dances and sweet cream baby cheeks. But there are also sleepless nights and mortgages and post baby stretch marks.WriterIf you go to the time and trouble of curing and smoking your own bacon, start by procuring a pork belly worthy of your efforts. This means from organic hogs (or hogs raised humanely without hormones or antibiotics).Grilling Authority, www.barbecuebible.comI wonder what my 20s would have been like if I had learned to meditate sooner. I wonder if my health would have been different or if I would have been able to handle it all better. Or if maybe all of this was part of a grand order of things. I have room in my life now where I didn\u0027t before.Senior Editor, HuffPost LAI have been a vocal opponent of that war since George W. Bush proposed the invasion in 2002. I strongly believe that the actions President Obama announced in Iraq last night deserve progressive support.Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersPresident Obama\u0027s announcement that the US will protect 40,000 Yazidis trapped on Iraq\u0027s Sinjar Mountain is a decisive response to an unfolding humanitarian disaster. Airdrops of water and food will save lives. The Yazidis, however, will not really be safe until they can get off the desert mountain and back to their homes in Sinjar.Former U.S. Ambassador to CroatiaThere are still moments of sadness, moments when I yearn for the physical presence of my daughter. I have learned that joy and sadness will be part of my experience for the remainder of my life. However, I have also found my peace in a forever-changed world; that has been empowering.Writer with specialities in grief and loss, spirituality and addiction. Speaker on grief and loss nationally.The Obama Administration\u0027s proposed regulation of existing power-sector sources of CO2 has the potential to be cost-effective, and if you accept these numbers, it can also be welfare-enhancing, if not welfare-maximizing.Director of the Harvard Environmental Economics ProgramSome people are asking, \"What kind of message is the NFL sending to women and girls about how they are valued in society?\" We have another question: What kinds of messages are young boys receiving from the Ray Rice incident?Former NBA basketball star and coach for the Boston CelticsFormer Attorney General of the State of New JerseyIn medicine, our goal is health, to make everything better.
