{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Military Correspondent, The Huffington PostThe abrupt change of command at the Pentagon, with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel resigning under pressure Monday, is more than a change of faces. It marks the final disillusionment with the two war-fighting strategies the United States has relied on for 13 years in Iraq and Afghanistan: the \"hearts and minds\" counterinsurgency formerly defined and pursued by Gen. David Petraeus, and the costly \"train and equip\" effort to build self-sustaining security forces in both countries. After the sacrifices of more than 5,300 American battle dead and 52,000 wounded, it has become clear that something more -- and different -- is needed, not least a new, strategy-savvy defense secretary who will articulate a coherent new approach, sell it to the White House, Congress, and the uniformed brass across the river at the Pentagon, and oversee its implementation.If you want to understand what makes Elizabeth Warren so special in American politics, consider her nervy leadership of the campaign to block President Obama\u0027s foolish nomination of one Antonio Weiss to be the top Treasury official in charge of the domestic financial system, including enforcement of the Dodd-Frank Act.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Why did Chuck Hagel step down as secretary of defense? Was it his choice, as Obama has suggested, or was he pushed? We may never be absolutely sure. But one thing that is clear is that Hagel\u0027s tenure was a missed opportunity to put our security policy on a sounder footing at a time of increasing uncertainty.Director, Arms and Security Project, Center for International PolicyFor decades now, the first four of these assertions have formed the foundation of U.S. policy in the Middle East. The events of 9/11 added the fifth, without in any way prompting a reconsideration of the first four.Author, \u0027The Limits of Power: The End of American Exceptionalism\u0027While the Republicans are scrambling to figure out their next steps and keep their forces together, the President and Democrats are taking victory laps with cheering crowds of recent immigrants who are mobilizing to stand up and defend executive action.Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersSecretary of Defense Chuck Hagel was supposed to steer the Pentagon away from a decade of war, including bringing U.S. troops home from Afghanistan and paving the way for a reduction in the Pentagon budget.Co-founder, CODEPINK: Women for PeaceApparently if the seventh investigation finds wrongdoing on the part of the administration, that\u0027s the one that will really matter? Sorry Fox News, but six strikes and you\u0027re out.Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaThe real problem is not that we\u0027re an addiction-addled culture of oversharers, though that may indeed be true. Instead, it\u0027s that we\u0027re a culture of complainers. We complain because it\u0027s in our nature, and we\u0027re more apt to complain than to do something about it.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarThe bottom line is that New Jersey charters do not serve the same population as the districts that house them. Specifically, they serve a smaller percentage of poor students and students with extra learning challenges.Teacher and writer; blogger, curmudgucation.blogspot.comThanksgiving has been celebrated by Native Americans, Christians, Jews and whoever else wants to since 1621, and I firmly believe we should continue unapologetically to celebrate giving thanks to God Almighty for our many blessings.AuthorThe world of short blogs and 140 characters is symbolic of the all too prevalent overly simplified analyses, and sensational headlines that might generation \"likes\" and \"retweets,\" but do not bring us to a better understanding of people, communities or our history.Global Consultant, Executive Coach focusing on issues of civil rights and diversityThe framers debated the meaning of corruption at the Constitutional Convention in 1787, and Americans have been arguing about it ever since. Today, gifts to politicians that were once called graft or bribes are called contributions.Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanySenior writer, Moyers \u0026 Company on public TV. Senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.Whether they look imposing, highly sexualized or catlike, Picasso\u0027s women are so specific and recognizable and so clearly part of the fabric of his inspiration and imagination.Culture Columnist, Huffington Post, CultureZohnPutin\u0027s post-Soviet regime may be approaching a crucial tipping point in its level of domestic support. Let\u0027s hope that the United States doesn\u0027t take his bait, and inadvertently prop him back up by giving him a military enemy to fight against.International security expert, Russia and Eurasia watcher; Professor at Barnard College, Columbia University; author of four booksNichols\u0027 blend of brutality, bite and poignancy was his brilliance, spilling over with insight -- on film, in comedy, on stage, on TV, in love, and in life.Writer/performer and Radio Host, Mia\u0027s WorldAt the first Thanksgiving 383 years ago, Native Americans and Pilgrim immigrants gathered with mutual respect to share a bountiful harvest they\u0027d produced together. This Thanksgiving, though, there\u0027s no respect or sharing in the homes of GOP nativists.International President, United SteelworkersWhat we are really asking when we ask sexual assault victims why they stayed, why they drank, why they took the pills, is Why did you allow yourself to become prey?International Fellow, Huffington PostThe authors of the article on recurrent violent injuries note that we have developed outpatient plans for people suffering from chronic disease. For some conditions, such programs usually involve self-monitoring by the patient and timely intervention by a medical professional. Shouldn\u0027t we have a comprehensive medical strategy for dealing with violence?Mike the Gun GuyThe CIO\u0027s role must evolve for the progressive enlightened enterprise to something else -- perhaps Chief Innovation Officer, Chief Integration Officer or, like a supermarket manager, a Chief Inventory Officer.Advisor to government and business leaders; Author, The Digital Economy, 20th Anniversary EditionToward the end of the campaign, in a series of targeted, lightly publicized meetings, Cuomo\u0027s top legislative priority emerged. It is rewarding campaign donors and block voting by religious communities with a back-door school vouchers plan for private and religious schools.Social studies educator, Hofstra University, my opinions, of course, are my ownReporting requirements like Connecticut\u0027s presumably reflect the belief that mentally ill persons who voluntarily seek hospital treatment are, as a group, at greater risk for future violence than the general population of the U.S. But this belief is false.President and Medical Director, Silver Hill HospitalAlthough every day provides an opportunity for reflection and change, Thanksgiving stands out as the perfect day to kick off a few new habits that will effect the longevity of our planet. If each of us revamped our consumption and waste habits by slightly adjusting what\u0027s already in place, the overall impact could be huge.Founder, Editor-In-Chief, Groovy Green LivinWith APSCU leading the effort to overturn the Obama administration\u0027s \"gainful employment rule,\" and with the collapse of Corinthian raising issues about how to protect students when predatory for-profit colleges fail, it\u0027s crucial to understand that this industry signs up many of its students through blatant deceptions.Attorney, advocate, writer at RepublicReport.orgThroughout America, disinvestment in infrastructure is far more typical. America\u0027s focus seems to be on individual spending, not investment in community resources. We refuse to tax ourselves and the signs of neglect are everywhere.Executive Director, Columbia University\u0027s Earth InstituteNow, this may seem a bit extreme in support of a dead poet but maybe you are not familiar with Constantine P. Cavafy. The translations of his words are timeless.Fashion MarketingPumpkin pie is always expected at Thanksgiving, but why not shake things up and make one of these five-star recipes instead? Double chocolate pavlova could be the ultimate sweet ending to your Thanksgiving feast -- and no one will miss that tired ol\u0027 pumpkin pie.Once Upon a ChefVanden Heuvel and Lowry debate \u0027Bamnesty\u0027 and \u0027Obamacare\u0027. Perhaps the best Left-Right framing of big reforms is FDR in 1936 comparing governments imperfectly reforming to status quo-ers kvetching from the sidelines. Or as Gypsies say, \"Dogs bark but the caravan moves on.\"I\u0027m happy that President Obama finally has moved forward with immigration reform.

How it seems to strike friends and family powerfully and at random. Lives are forever changed. That could have happened to our family today. For some reason, we were spared.
