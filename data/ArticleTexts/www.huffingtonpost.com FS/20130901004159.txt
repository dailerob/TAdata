{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"David BromwichProfessor of Literature, Yale UniversityThe way out of war is always peace. The way out is not limited, well-tailored, well-spoken, discreet, \"smart\" shots across the bow which you pretend are not acts of war. But peace comes from negotiations: an activity of which this president has always spoken in the warmest terms but at which he has shown few results during five years in office -- not in Afghanistan, not in Iran, not with Russia or China, not on global warming or nuclear proliferation. Why not start with Syria? It is smaller than those other cases, and peace there might lead to peace elsewhere. It will be unsatisfactory, no doubt. And deeply disappointing to people who admire speed and decision and the chance to wrestle with fortune while employing the largest weapons in the world. But it will be better than the multiplication of deaths.Comments (636)Joshua PragerAuthor, JournalistIt was not until last month -- 23 years later -- that I considered that my visions in the intensive care unit were related to the visions that had come upon me, off and on, in the years since.Comments (71)Jamie Lee CurtisActress and children\u0027s book authorAs we pause, and broil or grill or just sit and watch a ball game with our friends and family, let us remember those who have worked and struggled and died for us, for us to be better people individually as well as better people as a nation.Comments (22)Alec BaldwinActorJulie Harris\u0027 voice was like rainfall. Her eyes connected directly to and channeled the depths of her powerful and tender heart. Her talent, a gift from God.Comments (35)Jonathan D. LovitzPublic speakerYou know you know gay people. You realize by now that they\u0027re all around. You\u0027ve been on baseball teams and in locker rooms and rushed frats together. We, as the impossible to define bunch known as Gen-Y, have become increasingly cool with our gay brothers and friends.Comments (232)Peter S. GoodmanExecutive Business and Global News Editor, The Huffington PostOnly those who have forgotten how the United States and its allies wound up in a catastrophic war in Iraq could now charge toward military confrontation with Syria, absent a clear and credible annunciation of the intelligence that supposedly ties Bashar Assad\u0027s government to the chemical weapons attack, and without an agreed upon plan for how to handle the potential repercussions.Comments (642)Arianna HuffingtonSolvitur ambulando -- \"it is solved by walking.\" This phrase refers to the 4th century Greek philosopher Diogenes\u0027s response to the question of whether motion is real -- he got up and walked. \"It is solved by walking.\" As it turns out, there are many other problems to which walking is the solution.Comments (171)James ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027It will not be easy to reconstitute the Syrian nation, to reconcile its people, and to heal the many wounds inflicted by this devastating war. But this, not revenge, must be the goal we seek -- for the sake of the region, for Syria and most especially for the Syrian people.Comments (54)Frida BerriganBoard member, War Resisters League; Columnist, Waging NonviolenceThis back-to-school season, the average U.S. household will spend $634.78 on apparel, shoes, supplies and electronics. My husband Patrick and I, however, did not keep up with the Joneses on this one and our credit rating thanks us for our miserliness.CommentsKen ReedSports Policy Director, League of FansIt\u0027s mind-boggling that at a time when overweight and obesity levels are sky high among our young people, and physical activity levels are down, our schools are cutting physical education classes, recess and intramural sports programs.Comments (20)Nancy BrownCEO, American Heart AssociationAs we head into the Labor Day weekend, many Americans are looking forward to some well-deserved time off and relaxation. From a health standpoint, nothing could be better, especially if you\u0027re one of those people who make a habit of burning the candle at both ends.CommentsMohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOWhere do markets collectively stand on Syria? Here are four things to note as we enter a weekend full of political maneuverings and difficult decisions.Comments (20)Neal Barnard, M.D.President, Physicians Committee for Responsible MedicineIt sounds like a scene from a horror movie: injecting rabies into beagle puppies and watching as they succumb to one of the most miserable of diseases. This isn\u0027t fiction. It\u0027s a cruel experiment that is real and imminent.Comments (81)Kathleen ReardonProfessor, USC Marshall School; Author, \u0027The Secret Handshake\u0027 and \u0027Shadow Campus\u0027Over and over we have told ourselves, surely this latest attack on another country must have something to do with national security; surely our government has the big picture in mind and surely our government wouldn\u0027t put us in the same kind of fix yet again.Comments (229)Joseph A. PalermoProfessor, historian, authorThe British parliament\u0027s vote against going along with the United States\u0027 attack on Syria is a direct result of that country\u0027s attempts to come to terms with the lies of the Iraq War.Comments (604)Arianna HuffingtonIn this week\u0027s issue, we launch \"Invisible Casualties,\" a month-long series that examines the ever-growing -- but not widely discussed -- issue of suicide in the military.CommentsMichael SteelePolitical analyst; Fmr. Chairman, Republican National Committee; Fmr. Lt. Governor, MarylandDr. King\u0027s speech challenged the status quo of his time and now so must we. But we must first answer for our generation the question often asked of him: \u0027When will you be satisfied?\u0027Comments (46)Heather RoffVisiting Associate Professor, Josef Korbel School of International Studies at the University of DenverThat the Syrian regime used chemical weapons does not necessarily entail that the U.S. becomes the international judge, jury and executive to dole out punishments. Indeed, reprisals are subject to strict criteria.Comments (79)Paul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostReligion will be positively affected by the Internet to the degree that we own what we think and approach one another via the web with all the same integrity we maintain in our interactions offline.Comments (982)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Comments (449)Scott Barry Kaufman, Ph.D.Author, \u0027Ungifted: Intelligence Redefined\u0027; co-founder, The Creativity PostWhile introversion, sensitivity, and narcissism are all partially separate traits, hypersensitive covert narcissists are more likely to report that they are introverted and sensitive.Comments (128)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundJanol\u0027s good grades allowed him to attend an excellent magnet high school but he realized he didn\u0027t see his own experience reflected in the curriculum. He wants to see a new kind of teacher training become a priority throughout the educational system.Comments (118)Mike DunnProud Nutmegger, Univ. of Nebraska graduateIt\u0027s been described as a meltdown, but it really wasn\u0027t. At no point during Dave Chappelle\u0027s show at the Oddball Festival in Hartford was he ever anything other than in measured control of his actions. I was part of the audience at the show.Comments (135)Les LeopoldAuthor, \"How to Make a Million Dollars an Hour\" (Wiley 2013)Today, much of the \"strength, prosperity and well-being\" of our hard labor is being siphoned into the coffers of Wall Street. Perhaps, in honor of our labor we should remind ourselves how we are being robbed blind.Comments (55)Maureen ConwayThe question I\u0027m struggling with this Labor Day is: why do we expect so many jobs to pay so poorly? For the people who care for our children and our elderly, prepare and serve us our food, ring up our purchases, guard the buildings in which we work, and a host of other occupations, our policy response is that these individuals should become more skilled so that they can move out of these jobsComments (191)Doug BandowSenior Fellow, the Cato InstituteObama administration policy toward Syria is a slow train wreck. Unremitting pressure from war-minded elites is pushing President Barack Obama closer to military intervention in the bloody civil war. Yet getting involved would be a fool\u0027s errand.Comments (509)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027The dream was more than the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act, which both followed in the years after the history-changing 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. It finally was about King\u0027s vision for \"the beloved community.\"Comments (18)Nida KhanIndependent journalist; Radio correspondent and producerWhen the rhetoric against the Assad regime and Syria is eerily parallel to that prior to the Iraq war, wouldn\u0027t it make sense to wait, and to ask our leaders for actual information and proof? Are we ready to allow our government and the governments of our allies to commit such drastic action under our names yet again?Comments (64)Eva M. Selhub, M.D.Medical Doctor, executive coach, motivational speaker, and author of The Love ResponseHow you perceive yourself influences more than you realize. It determines how you experience your life and more so, how you handle uncertainty and adversity.CommentsRalph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorThe meaning Labor Day has been dulled by both rampant commercialism and public apathy. Shouldn\u0027t Labor Day be a time to gather, contemplate and celebrate more just treatment of all those who toil without proper recognition or compensation?Comments (42)Ross LuippoldHuffPost Comedy Deputy EditorAudiences must learn how to respect Dave Chappelle, or we might lose him for good.Comments (47)Dr. Josef Olmert, 2013.31.08Christine Owens, 2013.31.08Marc Gopin, 2013.31.08Craig Martin, 2013.31.08Susan Buchanan, 2013.31.08George Heymont, 2013.31.08Frida Berrigan, 2013.31.08Jerry Lanson, 2013.31.08Lin Evola, 2013.31.08Laura Cococcia, 2013.31.08Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"I WANT A VOTE! \u0027U.S. Should Take Military Action\u0027...
