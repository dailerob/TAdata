{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Our economy has slowed down to 1.3 percent growth, nine states are about to cut unemployment benefits, and, of course, our debt rating has just been downgraded. So it\u0027s no wonder people have lost faith that our broken political system will produce solutions to improve their lives. And as we approach the 2012 election, the debate is likely to get even further removed from the reality of what\u0027s going on in the country. Washington has tuned out the country, and the sentiment is being reciprocated. The question becomes: what now? Well, one place to start is with ourselves. Our politicians have chosen to narrow their imaginations, but they can\u0027t narrow ours. Even if we can\u0027t control how Washington responds to our problems, we still have control over how we respond to them.Read Post | CommentsPeter S. Goodman, 8/9/11Business Editor, The Huffington PostThe global economy is weak and still weakening, while policymakers seem unable or unwilling to marshal a reassuring response. From the United States to Europe to Japan, economies are stagnating, and governments are tightening the straits by cutting back on spending.Read Post | CommentsBarbara Ehrenreich, 8/9/11New York Times bestselling authorThe most shocking thing I learned from my research on the fate of the working poor in the recession was the extent to which poverty has been criminalized in America.Read Post | CommentsDan Rather, 8/9/11Host, \u0027Dan Rather Reports\u0027There\u0027s a real sense out there, even amongst people not prone to hyperbole, that perhaps our nation\u0027s best days are behind us. I guess it matters how you define \"best days,\" but I, for one, am not buying it. \u2028Read Post | CommentsJason Linkins, 8/9/11Editor, Eat the PressWere you wondering if President Barack Obama is secretly siding with London\u0027s opportunistic looters and arsonists? Probably not, because that sounds crazy... but not at National Review!Read Post | CommentsPaula Ravets, Ph.D., 8/9/11Clinical psychologistWhen I do a toast right I feel great. Not just because I don\u0027t get scolded, but because someone is there on the other side of the glass looking back at me. In this moment of being mutually engaged, everything feels possible.Read Post | CommentsMelissa Ramos, 8/9/11Nutritionist, Chinese Medical PractitionerFrom heartbreak to frustrations, many of us run to food to fill a void or feed our anger so much so that North America is facing an obesity epidemic -- an addiction to food in its own right. Maybe we can find love and comfort with whole foods.Read Post | CommentsVeronica Byrd, 8/9/11Director of African-American media for Planned Parenthood Federation of AmericaIs someone pushing black women into abortion against our will? Of course not. Our high abortion rate reflects our high rate of unintended pregnancy -- which in turn reflects poverty and a lack of accessible, affordable health care.Read Post | CommentsJared Bernstein, 8/9/11Senior Fellow, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesWhat was the biggest economic debate in this country in recent months? Was it which are the best jobs measures to get America back to work? No. It was whether to raise the debt ceiling or default. Enough already.Read Post | CommentsJune Carbone and Naomi Cahn, 8/9/11The creation of greater inequality, the shredding of the social safety net, and the increasing cost of higher education have much more do with the changing structure of the family than Hollywood mores or internet porn.Read Post | CommentsDavid Macaray, 8/9/11Playwright, labor columnist and authorIt\u0027s now a bit embarrassing to admit, but organized labor actually had high hopes for Barack Obama. But unfortunately, the man who said, \"Politics didn\u0027t lead me to working folks; working folks led me to politics,\" hasn\u0027t done much to help working folks.Read Post | CommentsKeli Goff, 8/9/11Author, commentator and contributing editor, TheLoop21.comWe ladies clearly don\u0027t have enough to worry about when it comes to our body image, so in addition to our thighs, our tummies, our rear-ends, our chests and our faces, the media has helpfully pointed out yet another body part we are supposed to feel insecure about: our feet.Read Post | CommentsCenk Uygur, 8/9/11Host of The Young TurksIf the clever guys at the White House don\u0027t realize they\u0027ve hit their tipping point, they\u0027re in for a rude awakening when that tsunami washes over them. They\u0027re headed into the 30s in the polls and I don\u0027t think they have any clue how to get out of there.Read Post | CommentsLindsay Maines, 8/9/11Blogger, Rock and Roll MamaI heard a Kenyan joke, \"We don\u0027t have oil here in Kenya -- our people are our main exports.\" We all laughed, but the truth is, though Kenya has many great natural resources, the people are an amazing asset. I have yet to meet an ordinary person.Read Post | CommentsPeter Montgomery, 8/9/11Senior Fellow at People for the American WayRick Perry is clearly positioning himself to enter the Republican presidential primary as a political savior to right-wing activists who are underwhelmed with their choices so far. Yet, he insists that America\u0027s problems are beyond human ability to fix.Read Post | CommentsStephanie Schriock, 8/9/11President, EMILY\u0027s ListToday is about our fight: women, labor, the progressive movement. We\u0027ve come together to support the policies that made this country great -- and the idea that we all do better, when we all do better.Read Post | CommentsFrances Beinecke, 8/9/11President, Natural Resources Defense CouncilA growing number of GOP lawmakers are starting to question the Tea Party\u0027s reckless overreach. They realize that anti-environmental efforts do not reflect the wishes of the American people.Read Post | CommentsCarly Schwartz, 8/8/11San Francisco Editor, The Huffington PostTo get in the festival spirit, we\u0027ll be rolling out a slew of Outside Lands-centric stories throughout the week, including a roundup of homegrown acts to check out, the best of OSL\u0027s non-music offerings, and your ultimate weekend survival guide.Read Post | CommentsLola Adesioye, 8/7/11British, NY-based writer, thought leader and commentator.There are some deep issues which must be handled here if we are to avoid a repeat of this type of violence. Hopefully we can use this as a teachable moment.Read Post | CommentsZaki Hasan, 8/9/11zakiscorner.comAt its core, the Apes series has always been about self-inflicted wounds -- the idea that man\u0027s unquenchable hubris inevitably leads to catastrophic consequences both for himself and those around him.Read Post | CommentsLeo Hindery, Jr., 8/9/11Chairman, U.S. Economy/Smart Globalization Initiative at the New America FoundationWith all the sturm und drang in recent weeks over raising the debt ceiling it\u0027s more than clear that we\u0027ve lost sight of the greatest economic challenge now facing our country, which is the legions of unemployed workers.Read Post | CommentsDon Tapscott, 8/9/11Advisor to government and business leaders; Author, \u0027Macrowikinomics\u0027We need no debate between old media and new media.

How many times do you ask yourself that question? Or think to yourself \"now that I bought these hot shoes, how can I make them fit and feel better?\"Read Post | CommentsAndy Ostroy, 8/9/11Political \u0026 pop culture analystI\u0027m not gonna say Hillary Clinton\u0027s perfect or baggage-free, but I firmly believe she would have fought much more effectively for Democrats if she\u0027d won in 2008. She knows first-hand how ruthless Republicans are when they\u0027re in battle.Read Post | CommentsNancy Keenan, 8/8/11President, NARALRick Perry invites charges of hypocrisy when he speaks so glowingly of so-called \"states\u0027 rights\" while at the same time vowing to use the powers of the federal government to erode women\u0027s freedom.Read Post | CommentsDavid H.
