{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, Hurricane Sandy slammed into the East Coast, leaving devastation in its wake -- and a long cleanup ahead. One of the things blown away by the superstorm was our ability to continue to willfully ignore the issues of climate change and disaster preparedness -- especially given our fast-deteriorating infrastructure. Though the presidential candidates might have largely ignored these problems, Sandy\u0027s storm surge swept them to the forefront of the campaign -- and the national conversation. Now that we\u0027re talking about them, the question becomes: will we actually do what\u0027s needed to ready ourselves for the next disaster -- or will we dry ourselves off, recharge our devices, and bury our heads back in the sand (after we rebuild the sand pile, of course)? Hopefully, Tuesday\u0027s election will be the last one that happens without a substantive debate on these issues. In the meantime, here is how you can help those who are still desperately in need.Read Post | Comments (159)Robert Redford, 11/02/12Actor, director and environmental activistIt will take resourcefulness and grit to reduce the carbon pollution that\u0027s fueling these storms, but Hurricane Sandy proves once again we have it.

Suddenly the artificial walls that our political process erects to separate us into little demographic micro-groups to make us believe we have no mutual interests got blown away. The collective effort, the we\u0027re-all-in-this-together spirit, has been great to see.Read Post | Comments (332)Will.i.am, 11/02/12Musician, technology advocate, and creator/executive producer of i.am FIRST: ScienceI made a new song that\u0027s a reminder of what this election is all about... we are all fighting for a better life... we are all wanting greater opportunities... we are all looking for solutions... we are all hurting wishing and praying for \"Great Times.\"Read Post | Comments (89)Kathleen Turner, 11/02/12ActressIf we have Todd Akin and Richard Mourdock making laws about who can access contraception, and a Romney Supreme Court deciding what rights women are entitled to, we can all forget about the DeLorean.

And Mitt Romney would appoint Supreme Court Justices who would uphold it.Read Post | Comments (210)Marlo Thomas, 10/31/12Award-winning actress, author and activistIn 1972, I was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention.
