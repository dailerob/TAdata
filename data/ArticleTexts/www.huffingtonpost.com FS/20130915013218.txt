{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Mark Gongloff, Jan Diehm and Katy HallThe financial crisis was hell for pretty much everybody, rich or poor. But the recovery that has followed has not been nearly as fair. Wall Street, the wealthy and the powerful have done amazingly well since the crisis ended. Little of that has trickled down to everybody else, in what has been the most uneven recovery in at least several decades. How about some charts to illustrate this infuriating result? The first sad chart might tell most of the story. It tracks the growth in corporate profits, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and average hourly wages of the typical worker since the crisis. To quote Sesame Street, one of these things is not like the others, one of these things just doesn\u0027t belong. (Hint: It is your pitiful wages.)Comments (7,568)Gary HartPresident, Hart International, Ltd.\"Often wrong, but never in doubt\" is a description of one kind of political mind. \"Occasionally wrong, but often in doubt\" is another. Applied to foreign policy, and especially the use of US military power, this formulation offers an insight into policy confusion over Syria.Comments (29)Anas Aremeyaw AnasUndercover journalist and private eyeIn my TEDTalk, I tell the full story of how it all started. I look back on over 14 years of my undercover reporting. There have been high and low points, but one thing that remains is the kind of impact this kind of journalism brings.Comments (100)Rep. Charles RangelRepresentative from the 13th Congressional District in New YorkIt is time to seize the moment.

Bernie SandersIndependent U.S. Senator from VermontWith a loud and clear voice, the overwhelming majority of the American people, across the political spectrum, are saying NO to another war in the Middle East -- Syria\u0027s bloody and complicated civil war.Comments (461)Deborah ChangEducator EntrepreneurI am a child of immigrants who came to the United States with next to nothing. When I was twelve, my father suffered from a stroke and has not been able to work since.Comments (24)James ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027In the end, the flaws of Oslo proved fatal. Today, the number of Israeli settlers has tripled; the Palestinian economy remains dependent on Israeli good-will and international largess; and thousands have died, victims of acts of terror, military assaults and settler violence.Comments (40)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureThe Republicans on the Hill are in absolute disarray, despite the leadership\u0027s genuflections to the radical right. It\u0027s amateur hour up there.Comments (900)Jamie BruesehoffBlogger, \u0027I Am Totally *That* Mom\u0027I know it\u0027s hard, but thank you for what you do when you bring your children to church. Please know that your family -- with all of its noise, struggle, commotion, and joy -- are not simply tolerated, you are a vital part of the community gathered in worship.Comments (352)Lauren DucaEditorial Fellow, The Huffington PostMeet Jessica \"Biel\" Timberlake. You may know her as the teenage girl who starred as Mary Camden-Rivera on \"7th Heaven\" or maybe you\u0027re more familiar with that person who married Justin Timberlake.Comments (144)Kia MakarechiEntertainment Editor, The Huffington PostOn Friday, Spinnin\u0027 decided it makes enough money from frat boys in bro tanks. Luckily for dance music fans with any sense of decorum, there are plenty of other record labels putting quality music out.Comments (15)Beth GriffithsBeauty and fashion bloggerThere are many reasons why a person uses a wheelchair, but the biggest thing to remember is this: if you do not know the person then why they use a wheelchair is none of your business.Comments (735)Arianna HuffingtonIn this week\u0027s issue, Jaweed Kaleem looks at the state of American conversation around \"the big questions,\" as students return to college campuses across the country.CommentsAllen FrancesProfessor Emeritus, Duke UniversityThe evidence is compelling that we in the developed countries (especially the US) are overtesting for disease, overdiagnosing it, and overtreating.Comments (87)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarMany children who grow up \"having it all\" find themselves burdened by a notorious surname, being recognized by nearly everyone as \"so-and-so\u0027s child.\" And when that parent is in the news -- observed, scrutinized -- so, too, is the child.CommentsGeorge LakoffAuthor, \u0027The Political Mind,\u0027 \u0027Moral Politics\u0027 and \u0027Don\u0027t Think of an Elephant!\u0027To President Obama, \"Syria\" is not primarily about direct causation. It is about systemic causation as it affects the world as a whole.Comments (346)Adam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; founder of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911The politics of the Affordable Care Act are irrelevant. The issue for me is privacy and data security and whether you\u0027re for Obamacare or against it, there are two ways the program\u0027s rollout could put your personal information at risk.Comments (149)Jonathan WeilerDirector of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel HillAnas\u0027 extraordinary work has me thinking about a debate in America that has acquired new meaning since Glenn Greenwald and others first started reporting in June on the NSA documents leaked by Edward Snowden.

Very rarely does one sentence change the way I interact with my family. But this one did.Comments (151)Chris NashawatyMovie Critic, Entertainment WeeklyWhen people hear that I review movies for a living, they usually assume that the films I must like are the kinds that win Oscars.Comments (37)DJ Louie XIVDJI\u0027ve been attending Fashion Week in some form or another since I was about 12, but I\u0027ve always done so as somewhat of an outsider. It started with my mother, then a prominent stylist, who would take me as her plus one to a show whenever possible.CommentsMichelle HansonMiss Arlington 2013I have memories of my judges smiles, and of the sound of my sweet teen yelling for me every time I stepped on stage. Photos are wonderful, but the memories are far more valuable. Live in the moment.Comments (37)Albert BrooksActor, Writer, Filmmaker, Comedian, Author, 2030: The Real Story of What Happens To AmericaMr. Putin, it\u0027s one thing to put down exceptionalism, but before you do that, you at least have to produce one Broadway show, or make one commercial airliner, or invent one type of salad.Comments (1,988)Alison SpiegelBlog Editor, Huffington Post Taste \u0026 TravelIf Portland, the so-called birthplace of the hipster, has become disingenuous, Astoria, Oregon feels just the opposite. It\u0027s not trying to be gritty, rustic and cool -- it just is. A town of restoration and renewal, it\u0027s a beacon of resilience and a great place to visit.Comments (22)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorShouldn\u0027t it make sense that President Obama would enjoy spending more time addressing rising child poverty and restoring taxes on the rich and corporations than ordering self-defeating metastasizing military operations?Comments (192)Kirk DouglasActorThere can never be forgiveness if we do not first admit our mistakes. Racism is a sin for which we have never atoned. It is a grave injustice that must be addressed before we can ever truly move forward as a nation. Apologies are not excuses, but they are a good start on the road to repentance.Comments (356)Barbara ColluraPresident/CEO, RESOLVE: The National Infertility AssociationAisha did not have to share her story.
