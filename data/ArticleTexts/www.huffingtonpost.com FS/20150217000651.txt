{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Greece and the European Union could face a showdown in their debt talks as early as this week. And if you had to place odds right now, the likelihood is that the stubbornness of Europe\u0027s senior leaders will create a catastrophe for both Greece and the EU. Here is the state of play. The new Greek leaders, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, spent most of the past two weeks making the case for relaxed terms. They hit a stone wall. Under the current agreement, EU financial institutions spoon-feed loans to Greece, 80 percent of which cycle right out of Greece to pay holders of Greek bonds. Greece itself gets little benefit. In return, Greece is supposed to continue imposing crushing austerity terms. Most onerously, the Greek government is expected to run a \"primary\" budget surplus (excluding interest payments) equal to 4.5 percent of GDP. Greece is also supposed to keep cutting wages. Thanks to this medicine, the Greek economy keeps shrinking and debt as a share of Greek GDP keeps increasing.President Obama\u0027s remarks, last week, at the annual National Prayer Breakfast were theologically sound and politically smart. In spite of this, his comments set off a storm of criticism from conservative critics who took him to task for both his theology and his politics.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027A high-quality public education can unlock our children\u0027s potential. It can bring communities together. It can ensure a top-notch workforce for our economy and an engaged citizenry for our democracy. We have an opportunity with the ESEA reauthorization to help reclaim the promise of public education.President, American Federation of TeachersThe Copenhagen killings are reviving the Charlie Hebdo experience. The dramatic video, the bloodied office, the manhunt, the hostages, the outrage, the marches, the ubiquitous Je Suis Charlie placards. And then the politicians\u0027 pledges, the analysis, the endless commentaries.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghTo be the guest of a great lord in his castle was an honor reserved for notable visitors known to the host, but others would arrive with a letter of introduction from the king or queen or a member of their family or friends of the host.Author and Historian; author of the acclaimed Anjou Trilogy and frequent lecturer and historical writer.As a nation, we have to grapple with events such as these in ways that collectively deepen our understanding of the intersections between race, class and gender at every level. We need to ask: How can we bring our communities together to end intolerance, hate and violence?Filmmaker and CEO of Not In Our Town, a national movement to stop hate and create safe, inclusive communities for all. NIOT.orgNow that the FBI Director and a sitting Supreme Court judge have spoken, maybe people will stop name-calling and let us deal with the gravity of the issue. Now it is our job to make this renewed attention lead to sustainable results. At the end of the day, it doesn\u0027t matter who the messenger is, as long as those that are the hardest to reach can hear it.President, National Action NetworkAm I black in a cop\u0027s hands when he is pushing, pressing hard for dope or a gun or a rope or a knife or a fist? I am not a black body, yet my body is somehow, somewhere, theirs -- Trayvon\u0027s, Emmett\u0027s, thousands more at the end of a rope\u0027s tight murderous swing.Writer, JournalistAside from the arguments about the merits of hate-crime statutes, these crimes are notoriously difficult to prosecute because of the high burden prosecutors face when proving that the defendant\u0027s bias indeed motivated the crime.Professor of Law at Wake Forest University School of LawThe many positive character traits that Lincoln displayed have the ability to impact all of us, lead to greater entrepreneurial success and serve to inspire the next generation.President, CEO, Women’s Business Development CenterThe fact that someone has a propensity to behave violently doesn\u0027t ipso facto mean that they would ever express this anger by using a gun. But there is no other form of personal behavior that is as dangerous and costly as pulling a trigger at yourself or someone else. Wouldn\u0027t it be much easier to just get rid of the guns?Mike the Gun GuyNBC News\u0027 investigative unit has a unique opportunity to find out why its award-winning journalism fell so short of the mark on one of the biggest domestic stories of this young century. Whether they succeed or fail will be far more important than the ultimate fate of Brian Williams.Your dog\u0027s best friendSo while many women are able to get the birth control that\u0027s right for them, with small or no co-pays, too many are still like Alice after her fall in Carroll\u0027s first chapter -- lying on one side, peering through a keyhole into a garden of treasures she couldn\u0027t quite get to.Pulitzer Prize-winning journalistThe only word for it is chutzpah: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u0027s call for European Jews to flee to Israel from the claws of a newly rampant anti-Semitism that is supposedly sweeping Europe.Author, \"The Watchman\u0027s File\"The world is becoming more accessible, with airlines, accommodation and everything in between available at budget-friendly prices. If you can sort through the droves of information, you can go a lot further for a lot less. You can collect and redeem miles, watch for seat sales but if you\u0027re open minded to other ideas, here are a few other options that can help you travel on a budget.Digital Marketer in Asiaif non-Christians should be tolerant of Christian symbols and references in public spaces then why shouldn\u0027t Christian\u0027s be tolerant of public spaces being void of all religious paraphernalia. After all who does it hurt if the areas owned by everyone are free from all religious trappings?Political blogger, Detroit NewsSince it feels so big and important, I asked friends of mine who have survived their thirtieth year to give me one piece of advice that they felt would be of value when I hit the big milestone.Publicist in Beverly HillsWhen members of Congress caved to demands from the insurance industry and ditched their plan to establish a \"public option\" health plan, the lawmakers also ditched one of their favorite talking points, that a government-run plan was necessary to \"keep insurers honest.\"Author, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgMore Americans are dying of drug overdoses than traffic accidents, primarily from heroin and prescription pills like oxycodone and Vicodin.

We\u0027ll take a look at just how messy it got last week, and what happens now.

The big standardized tests.Teacher and writer; blogger, curmudgucation.blogspot.comThe story of the court intrigues in Abdullah\u0027s last days, and the leaked recordings which have come out since then, show something that was not immediately apparent in June 2013, when Egypt\u0027s first elected president Mohammed Morsi was overthrown by his army, after mass demonstrations against his rule.Editor, Middle East EyeOnce in a while in the U.S. we hear about a bill or a law that seems like it must be a joke. These examples might seem silly and inconsequential, but even so, at their core, they speak to very discriminatory ideas about gender, authority and rights that manifest themselves in much more dangerous ways all over the world.Feminist, writer, and satirist (not always in that order)There\u0027s hardly been enough time to consider what you really want.

So here is a moment for David Carr.Author, \u0027Public Parts\u0027 and \u0027What Would Google Do?\u0027It will come as no surprise to you that we\u0027re top-notch when it comes to denouncing barbarism -- as long as it\u0027s theirs. Unfortunately, when it comes to our own barbarism, we turn out to be a tad weaker, whether you\u0027re talking about torture or the deaths of children by drone.Editor, TomDispatch.comAfter nearly 16 years, comedian Jon Stewart is leaving the reins of The Daily Show. Recently, a number of comic hosts have left long-term late-night gigs, but barely a blip on the giggle continuity screen. I mean, Stewart\u0027s departure is not like Walter Cronkite signing off.
