{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"They say good things come in threes, and in that spirit, I\u0027m delighted to announce three great additions to the Huffington Post: HuffPost Culture, HuffPost Celebrity, and HuffPost San Francisco. HuffPost Culture is designed to be a one-stop shop that will give you the latest news -- and hopefully spark impassioned conversations -- about the worlds of film, theater, art, architecture, music, opera, TV, and design, while HuffPost Celebrity happily embraces our country\u0027s ongoing obsession with celebrities... it\u0027s the latest news, the biggest deals, the sexiest looks, the scariest mug shots. And HuffPost San Francisco will cover all the Bay Area has to offer, from its glamorous, fun side to the issues -- including homelessness and unemployment -- that are threatening to turn the City by the Bay into a tale of two cities... one marked by opulence and plenty, the other by misery and deprivation. Check out all three sections, and let us know what you think.Read Post | CommentsDoug Kendall, 7/13/11Founder and President, Constitutional Accountability CenterRepresentative Bachmann has been steadily improving in the polls, but it seems that the more she talks, the more gaffes she makes.Read Post | CommentsRobert Reich, 7/13/11Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Aftershock\u0027Mitch McConnell\u0027s debt ceiling compromise allows Republicans to vote against raising the debt limit without bearing the horrendous consequences of a government default.
