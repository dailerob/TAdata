{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Associate professor, historian, authorBefore the liberals write the GOP\u0027s obituary it would be wise to acknowledge the role other \"bubbles\" play in inventing new and ingenious ways to get people to vote against their own self-interests. Rather than one all-encompassing \"bubble\" that hermetically seals the Republicans inside their media universe, there\u0027s no shortage of other equally important bubbles that serve corporate power.

(The first of three Hobbit movies, actually.) But, most of the buzz -- both good and bad -- stems from the fact that The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey will be shown on a special kind of film with a rate of 48 frames per second. Truth be told, I had no idea what this meant when it was first announced.Read Post | Comments (577)Marlo Thomas, 12/04/12Award-winning actress, author and activistAs the holidays approach I can already taste the fabulous holiday meals.
