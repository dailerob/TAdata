{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Executive Director of the American Civil Liberties UnionAlmost 13 years later, the most egregious part of the Patriot Act, Section 215 -- which underlies the National Security Agency\u0027s call-records program -- is scheduled to expire on June 1. Some legislators want Congress to reauthorize it in its current form -- Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has just introduced a bill that would do exactly that, extending it for another five years. Others want to make relatively minor changes. Congress shouldn\u0027t do either of these things. Unless Congress can coalesce around far-reaching reform, it should simply let the provision expire.

But it\u0027s true.TV news reporter turned stay-at-home mama. Creator, SheJustGlows.comI have no idea what the Benghazi House Committee will find or conclude, but delaying their findings and conclusion until 2016 is wrong.Host, Fox News\u0027 \u0027On the Record With Greta Van Susteren\u0027We tend to treat these desperate migrant appearances en masse as sudden, unexpected events, almost like a tornado or tsunami, disconnected from the daily grind of national policy making and bad habits. They are not disconnected.Executive Director, MIT Center for International StudiesOnly a sweeping Constitutional Amendment can save us from a global environmental disaster beyond our imagination.Editor, Tikkun MagazineThe Republican claims are laughable -- but the GOP budget cuts seeking to decimate the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy are deadly serious.Chair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusToday, with climate change, our problem is that we are all part of the problem, leaving many of us feeling powerless to contribute much to solutions.

President Obama and Congress should reject the invitation.Professor of law and political science, Yale; Author \u0027We the People:The Civil Rights Revolution\u0027As we celebrate Earth Day, it\u0027s a good time to remember that pollution and climate change aren\u0027t just environmental issues. They\u0027re justice issues. Worldwide, people of color shoulder a heavier burden from toxic water, contaminated air, and dwindling natural resources.U.S. Representative, California\u0027s 13th congressional districtJews and Muslims should not be working against each other, but with each other to promote their common interests and rights as religious minorities in Europe, particularly with the rise of right-wing parties across the continent.Ibn Khaldun Chair Research Fellow, American UniversityIt\u0027s for such reasons that I wish every policy maker trying to work with Iran could school himself in Farhadi\u0027s movies and see how every new step and revelation leaves one only deeper in an ever more bewildering maze. What is gambit and what sincere, where devil\u0027s advocacy ends and genuine unexpectedness begins, is hard for anyone (even those orchestrating all the moves) ever to know.Essayist, novelist, travel writerAlabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas and Virginia all participate in this misguided paean to a troubling past. No, this is not the continuation of some long-standing tradition, but amazingly a creature of modern politics starting in 1994.Scientist and former White House Senior Policy Analyst; Ph.D. in marine biology/neurophysiologyRush, let me talk to you the way I\u0027d talk to someone who knows absolutely nothing about the differences between capitalism and socialism. When a business owner decides on a wage policy for his employees, that is something that only happens in capitalism. In socialism, the government doesn\u0027t just set a minimum wage; it determines all wages.Author of \u0027Obama’s America: A Transformative Vision of Our National Identity\u0027My personal motto is never be ashamed of something that keeps you alive. That\u0027s what I\u0027ve stuck with. My tubes are my lifeline and without them I would literally drop dead.Chronic Illness Advocate/Blogger Chronicallyawesome23.blogspot.comRose may never be the player he was before a series of catastrophic knee surgeries, and that\u0027s OK. But the Bulls currently have a roster capable of beating anybody in a prolonged series -- and that all hinges on whether Rose can be the guy, if only for a couple months.The Huffington Post\u0027s sports columnist, The Schultz ReportEarth day is a reminder that change takes time and work, and decades of commoditized political influence can only be undone by \"We the People\" through a constitutional amendment that states, \"Money is not free speech -- and corporations are not people.\"Co-Founder, Ben \u0026 Jerry\u0027s Ice Cream and Head Stamper, StampStampede.orgThe most interesting part of Mad Men, now in its final season, is the tense dynamic between the show\u0027s two female leads. Peggy and Joan should have reason to bond. Instead, the sexism they experience in the workplace often drives them apart.Blogs Editor, Huffington Post CanadaPrime Minister Narendra Modi and his government have a strong commitment to bringing \"24/7\" power to all. But while the government works to expand access to the grid, the growth of renewables -- including solar, wind, and biomass -- has opened up new frontiers of decentralized energy models to bring electricity to households and business enterprises now.President of The Rockefeller FoundationThis Earth Day while celebrating our big accomplishments, we also need to think about something small: the honeybee. Though less than an inch long, the tiny honeybee has major implications for our food supply.Executive director, Environment AmericaWhile Periscope continues to curry favor, Meerkat\u0027s life is not on the line yet.

Live streaming will bring a new dynamic to social media that has the potency to last.Head of Social at MEC, Digital Content and Audience guyIt was Saturday night and my 6-year-old was bursting with excitement.

The babysitter was on her way.Author, blogger at MommyAtoZBlog.comToo many of us are hesitant to question a medical diagnosis: a 2005 Gallup poll that surveyed 5,000 Americans found that about half reported \"never\" seeking a second opinion and a paltry three percent always sought out a second opinion on a diagnosis, treatment, drug or operation. Pretty frightening statistics, don\u0027t you think?Freelance Writer, www.sherylkraft.com, www.mysocalledmidlife.net, www.healthywomen.orgSome observers thought that conservative candidates would be inclined to avoid the so-called \"third rail\" of American politics this time around, but the opposite seems to be true.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero Hourf you spend the entire trip trying to capture the absolute best shot of the Taj Mahal, it cheapens the whole experience.

And three out of the four were short-term and looked at a very small number of participants. And none address the elephant in the room: What happens to your risk of heart disease, cancer, and overall mortality if you follow this diet for years?Registered DietitianEast Coast citizens are crying out against the oil industry coming to their coast, but it seems that neither this -- nor the devastating impacts of the BP disaster -- are enough to protect them from offshore drilling activity.Actor; board member, OceanaCEO, OceanaGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"LET\u0027S GET READY TO RUMBLE",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
