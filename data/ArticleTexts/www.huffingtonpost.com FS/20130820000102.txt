{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Adam GrantWharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027We all know people who are go-getters. They’re the power brokers and business tycoons who are ambitious and enterprising in their pursuit of success. But there’s another path to success, one that focuses less on getting and more on giving. Think of the people you know who go out of their way to benefit others. Authors Bob Burg and John David Mann call them go-givers. Go-givers view money and power as incomplete dimensions of success. They define success more broadly to include Third Metric measures: contributing to others, sharing their wisdom and creativity, and promoting the well-being of groups and communities. And starting today, The Huffington Post is putting the spotlight on Go-Givers with a track record of helpfulness and generosity.Comments (24)Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027In this anti-government, laissez-faire nation, the military gets a safe conduct pass to do something that no other branch of government is ideologically allowed to do -- commit the sin of economic planning.Comments (180)Lisa BelkinSenior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, The Huffington PostWhy do I care? Let’s start by admitting that I do. I watched that door of the Lindo Wing of St. Mary\u0027s Hospital in London for the first glimpse of the new family. I cooed at the new Prince’s little Royal Wave.CommentsMaureen RyanTV critic, The Huffington PostUltimately Skyler\u0027s arc is an overt and concrete rejection of \"the antihero\u0027s wife as victim\" trope. \"Breaking Bad\" may have unconsciously fed into that trend when it started out, but it\u0027s energetically spent the last season and a half making Skyler every bit as formidable as Walt, Hank or Gus.Comments (116)Mike JulianelleBlogger, DadandBuried.comIt\u0027s uncanny how many aspects of the parenting experience remind me of prison -- complete with a sadistic little warden who harbors a Napoleon complex.Comments (1,127)Stefanie WilliamsWriter and bloggerWe all fear this label. And the ironic part is, most of us do the slutty slut stuff. We take pics. We sext. We sleep with our boyfriends. Husbands. We get naked. We have vaginas. We use them. Some of us, sometimes, even enjoy using them.Comments (38)Ayaan Hirsi AliFounder, AHA FoundationIn Cairo, Egyptian history appears to have completed a bloody full circle. First the crowds filled Tahrir Square to demand the end of a military-backed dictatorship. Then, just two years later, the crowds filled Tahrir Square again to demand the restoration of a military-backed dictatorship.Comments (154)Beth KohmDeputy Executive Director, PFLAG NationalAbout six months ago my 6-year-old, Joshua, asked, \"Mom, what is \u0027transgender\u0027?\" I explained as best as I could, but I also said that it\u0027s a very complicated topic that sometimes even grownups struggle with. Joshua thought about it for a moment and then issued his surprising response.Comments (325)Mike Hogan and Christopher RosenSo, what can we expect from Lee Daniels\u0027 The Butler? Nothing, I guess, but for the sake of some dog-days chatter let\u0027s start here: nominations for Best Picture, Best Actor (Forest Whitaker), Best Supporting Actress (Oprah Winfrey), Best Costumes and Best Makeup all seem possible, with Danny Strong certainly on the list for Best Original Screenplay.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorWhile \"entrepreneurial culture\" will always be essential, many innovations that turned out to be economically important in the U.S. have government fingerprints all over them.Comments (207)Robert LockardBusiness and Entertainment WriterThe revelations about the government engaging in unprecedented levels of surveillance have inspired many people to worry about their freedom and privacy. It might seem odd to talk about a religious book in this context, but the Book of Mormon has a lot to say about this issue.Comments (87)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesGlenn is right in describing it as \"designed to send a message of intimidation.\" At this point, the governments involved are desperate to shut things down and don\u0027t seem to care how arrogant, over-reaching or unbelievable they come off.Comments (115)Carolina LarrieraSergio Vieira de Mello\u0027s partner; Fellow, Harvard UniversityOn this anniversary we should take a moment to reflect on the life of a UN official who was truly committed to the ideals and principles of peace. However, we must also demand an independent investigation, doing justice to the memory of the people who lost their lives in Baghdad on August 19, 2003.CommentsKathleen ReardonProfessor, USC Marshall School; Author, \u0027The Secret Handshake\u0027 and \u0027Shadow Campus\u0027A mammography unit that won\u0027t do its best to make you comfortable shouldn\u0027t be in business. You wouldn\u0027t normally volunteer for a colonoscopy where they had run out of anesthetic -- so why volunteer to be abused during a mammogram because they don\u0027t train their technicians properly?CommentsDr. Yvonne Bohn, Dr. Allison Hill \u0026 Dr. Alane ParkOB/GYNs and authors of The Mommy Docs\u0027 Ultimate Guide to Pregnancy and BirthCollege comes with big life changes that you need to be prepared for, but it\u0027s important to pay respect to your vagina as well.Comments (13)William K. BlackAssoc. Professor, Univ. of Missouri, Kansas City; Sr. regulator during S\u0026L debacleThe Mortgage Bankers Association has conned the FBI in 2007, and the FBI has remained conned. The result is that the FBI operates under a faux definition of \"mortgage fraud\" in which it is conceptually impossible for the banks and their controlling officers to be criminals.Comments (45)Toni VerstandigChair of the Aspen Institute\u0027s Middle East Programs and Senior Vice President at the S. Daniel Abraham Center for Middle East PeaceToday, Secretary Kerry not only recognizes the added value of the private sector in supporting the advancement of peace between Palestinians and Israelis, but he is leading a full-scale approach to building new partnerships that will have sustainable impact on the ground. Focusing on creating the economic, as well as political and security conditions needed to build a long-term solution of an independent Palestinian state is critical to the viability of the peace process.CommentsSec. Kathleen SebeliusSecretary of Health and Human ServicesFor months, we have seen local stories of families and communities struggling to cope as Head Start programs have been forced to turn away children. And now we have added up all those cuts from across the country to better understand the national impact.Comments (120)AmeliaMother, wife, partner and breadwinnerWhile the stylist was working on my son\u0027s hair, she started talking about what a lady killer he must be and how he must be fighting off the girls with a stick, etc. I knew she was still trying to be complimentary, but my son is gay and has self-identified that way for almost two years.Comments (34)Abby WambachTwo-time Olympic gold medalist, 2012 FIFA World Player of the YearI was a teenager... and I idolized the US Women\u0027s National Team. They were amazing players and people who were living a life that was hard to comprehend. Fortunately, I was also beginning to play on youth national teams and I slowly started to envision myself in their shoes.CommentsBill McKibbenAuthor of a dozen books, including \u0027The End of Nature\u0027 and \u0027Deep Economy\u0027We may not need capital-L Leaders, but we certainly need small-l leaders by the tens of thousands. You could say that, instead of a leaderless movement, we need a leader-full one.Comments (83)Daniel ZoughbieCEO of Microclinic International, TED FellowIf we are ever going to solve this trillion-dollar problem, we have to think outside the box, outside the clinics, and outside the hospitals. We have to think about how people behave in their neighborhoods, homes, and places of business.CommentsMohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOWith political will, America has the ability to promote high and inclusive economic growth, create sustainable jobs, enhance productive opportunities for its citizens, improve public services, and arrest the type of inequality that silently eats away at social integrity and cohesion.Comments (486)Kirk DouglasActorI sat in the driver\u0027s seat and I saw a note on the wheel. I recognized Michael\u0027s handwriting: \"Dad, you always say I never asked you for anything but you gave me a lot. Love, Michael.\" What is the opposite of rejection? Acceptance.Comments (156)Shai AgassiFounder, Better Place, Inc.The entire car industry should probably study Tesla, to understand if and how it plans to take such market share from all current incumbents. Assuming they will all learn the same underlying secret, what car will they make after they finished their collective hypothetical study?Comments (96)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundOur children are afraid for their friends, their families, and themselves. They know something needs to change. But they can\u0027t get there without us -- and they certainly can\u0027t get there by arming themselves with still more guns.Comments (309)Jennifer HarveyAssociate Professor of Religion, Drake UniversityWe don\u0027t assume pat answers are adequate for enabling our children to learn to navigate relationships, nutrition, sexuality, religion, emotions or any other challenging reality. Why should race and racism be any different?Comments (484)Raymond J. LearsyAuthor, \u0027Ruminations on the Distortion of Oil Prices and Crony Capitalism\u0027How extraordinary it would be were we to figuratively \"beat our swords into plowshares,\" that is, to convert our weaponry deliveries to a like value in wheat deliveries, showing a brotherly concern for the travails of all Egyptians in this, their dark hour.Comments (15)Linda RobertsonLeader, Local HIV/AIDS Outreach Team, Overlake Christian Church; Volunteer, RoseHedge MultiFaith WorksWhile your child is still alive, don\u0027t worry about what your friends will think. Twenty years from now, your friends\u0027 opinions won\u0027t keep you up at night. But your remorse about not loving your child while you still had the chance will. Trust me on this.Comments (225)Christine PelosiChair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusNinety-three years ago today women officially earned our right to vote and we\u0027ve been making our voices heard ever since. We\u0027ve come a long way in 93 years, but the recent assaults on women\u0027s health, worker\u0027s voices and voting rights signal that we still have far to go.Comments (41)Tyler KingkadeI want to offer Lena Dunham some unsolicited advice about a simple write-in to appease the Girls naysayers. It\u0027s actually pretty simple: make Shoshanna have student loan problems.CommentsPam Grout, 2013.19.08Mark Sissons, 2013.19.08Monique El-Faizy, 2013.19.08Sue Kerr, 2013.19.08DJ Jaffe, 2013.19.08Irene Monroe, 2013.19.08Chris Holden, 2013.19.08Andy Braner, 2013.19.08Steve Mariotti, 2013.19.08Dr. Susan Albers, 2013.19.08Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"\u0027YOU\u0027VE HAD YOUR FUN.
