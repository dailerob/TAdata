{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Mitt Romney formed a presidential exploratory committee this week. So did Rick Santorum. The pair joined fellow Republicans Tim Pawlenty and former Louisiana Gov. Buddy Roemer, who have previously gone the exploratory committee route, and Newt Gingrich who, in early March, launched \"Newt Explore 2012,\" a website that proclaims he is \"excited about exploring\" the idea of running for president. I guess that means that likely-but-not-yet-in candidates Mike Huckabee, Michele Bachmann, Haley Barbour, Jon Huntsman, Mitch Daniels, and Sarah Palin are exploring the idea of exploring the idea of an exploratory committee. Since when did all this political Lewis and Clarking become the norm of running for president? It\u0027s like announcing that you\u0027re forming a committee to see if you want to marry your girlfriend. Either you want to commit or you don\u0027t. Why would we want to support a candidate who needs to explore whether he or she wants to lead us?Read Post | CommentsHoward Fineman, 04.12.2011Editorial Director, Huffington Post Media GroupIf President Obama thinks Medicare is essential to our Union, he had better make the case convincingly.
