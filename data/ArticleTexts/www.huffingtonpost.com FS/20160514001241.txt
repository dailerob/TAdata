As you likely know, faith-based organizations don’t endorse candidates. So you won’t be surprised that I am not going to endorse Donald Trump — nor will I endorse his Democratic opponent. But we faith leaders will comment on the morality of this presidential campaign, the issues raised or not raised, and the morality of candidates based on our moral values.

Sounds like fiction, but it\u0027s not.Scientist, Photographer, and WriterWatching the mad, mad, mad, mad world that is the 2016 presidential campaign, I was trying to remember a presidential campaign that was as jaw-dropping, at least in my lifetime, and easily settled on 1968.Senior writer, BillMoyers.com.

But I am honored and grateful that today the Marlboro County Public Library -- the Marian Wright Edelman Library in Bennettsville, SC -- provides a panoply of early childhood and adult literacy programs.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundNot so fast: the rebel movement of distressed and despairing Republicans who have emerged under the hashtag-cum-banner #NeverTrump has not given up the fight to keep the ranting rawhide chew from reaching the Oval Office.
