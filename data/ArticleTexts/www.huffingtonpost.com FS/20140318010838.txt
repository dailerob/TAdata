{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Mohamed A. El-ErianChief Economic Advisor, AllianzCan good old-fashioned economic self-interest provide temporary relief for what now seems to be an intractable crisis in the Ukraine? The answer is yes it can; and, more importantly, may well eventually and temporarily do so... by incentivizing a de-escalation of mounting tensions, but failing to durably resolve underlying problems that will likely re-emerge down the road. The crisis in Ukraine pits multiple parties against each other, both domestic and foreign. Each of them is operating with a different set of internal and external constraints, along with contrasting interpretations of the past and present -- and of course, the future. As recent developments vividly illustrate, none of the parties involved is strong enough to impose its will and interpretation of events on the others. Because of this complex reality, the crisis has already taken quite a few surprising and precarious turns, including this weekend\u0027s referendum.CommentsJustin RosensteinCo-Founder, AsanaThe things that money can buy haven\u0027t contributed a fraction as much to my happiness as the satisfaction I experience from contributing to the world.CommentsBlair ChristieSenior Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, CiscoThree things are true in STEM: There are a lot of job openings. These jobs pay well. And there are not enough qualified people to fill these jobs.Comments (2)Barbra StreisandSinger; Actress; Director; Composer; ActivistThe critics say we need industrial agriculture to feed the growing population of the world. We\u0027re told that we cannot go back to natural, regenerative, organic farming as the way we grow our food. In short, this isn\u0027t true.CommentsMax TegmarkMIT physicist, author of \"Our Mathematical Universe\"It\u0027s a sensational breakthrough involving not only our cosmic origins, but also the nature of space: by producing the first-ever detection of Hawking radiation (the process by which inflation\u0027s rapid doubling generates these gravitational waves), the BICEP2 team has found the first experimental evidence for quantum gravity.Comments (18)Chade-Meng TanJolly Good Fellow, GoogleWhen it comes to mindfulness meditation, especially how it is practiced and taught in the context of the workplace, I have good news, even better news and bad news.CommentsEvelyn LeopoldVeteran journalist reporting from the United NationsThe West\u0027s objective in the UN Security Council was to show Moscow it was isolated in conducting a referendum in the Crimea asking Russia to annex the region. But none of this affected President Vladimir Putin.Comments (33)Adam GrantWharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027If we want girls to receive positive reinforcement for early acts of leadership, let\u0027s discourage bossy behavior along with banning bossy labels. That means teaching girls to engage in behaviors that earn admiration before they assert their authority.Comments (25)Randi WeingartenPresident, American Federation of TeachersIt\u0027s hard work to try to help all kids, not just some. This is the underlying fight in New York and elsewhere right now. Mayor de Blasio has crafted a thoughtful, comprehensive plan to strengthen education for all children.Comments (23)Seamus McKiernanSenior Blog Editor, Special Projects, Huffington PostMy name is Seamus, but I don\u0027t celebrate St. Patrick\u0027s Day. I\u0027m worried the holiday has become a farce, a celebration of cartoonish symbols of Irish culture that minimize, dilute and demean what it means to be Irish.Comments (84)Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The best thing that Democrats -- including President Obama -- have come up with lately are measures to remind voters that Democrats care about the worsened economic condition of ordinary working families and Republicans don\u0027t.Comments (261)Dan ArelWriter, speaker and journalistEpisode two of Cosmos, hosted by Neil DeGrasse Tyson aired this week and Tyson, towards the end of the program made one of the best statements that one can hope sank into the minds of young and old viewers alike, and most importantly, creationists.Comments (85)Kristin ArmstrongAuthor, contributing editor for Runner\u0027s World magazine, Runner, MotherI see it all around me, women who shrug and describe their purpose as being a wife or a mother when those are roles, not purposes. A ring finger and a uterus do not a calling make (Yoda-speak for think bigger).CommentsMichael BrennerSenior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghThe United States is prone to arrogance along with everyone else. That tendency is reinforced by the conviction that America was born under a Providential star - singled out to lead the world, whether by example or action, down the path of enlightenment.Comments (21)Lewis LaphamEditor of Lapham\u0027s QuarterlyFor the last several years, the word \u0027revolution\u0027 has been hanging around backstage on the national television talk-show circuit waiting for somebody, anybody -- visionary poet, unemployed automobile worker, late-night comedian -- to cue its appearance on camera.Comments (13)Peter DreierE.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeYou\u0027ve never seen a documentary like this. Brothers Hypnotic is not a concert film, but a documentary about how eight individuals forged a collective musical enterprise in a society and industry that rewards individualism, competition, and celebrity.CommentsRev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkIt\u0027s easy to attack and demagogue those who don\u0027t have a voice. It\u0027s easy to blame others when you fail to provide true leadership. And it\u0027s easy to reinforce stereotypes and misconceptions to win elections, or to win over your party\u0027s base. That is precisely what Paul Ryan did last week.CommentsPeter WattsWriter and presenterThere\u0027s nothing as politically intoxicating as a wildly baying crowd, and social media turned the dragon into a self-enforcing cycle. Negative politics are now instantly rewarded by the re-tweeting adulation of the base.CommentsAllison VesterfeltWriterYou hate your job. You try to pretend like you don\u0027t, but you do. You get in the car every morning, with your coffee in hand and take a deep breath.CommentsLeo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersRepublicans despise America\u0027s poor and jobless. The GOP made that perfectly clear by repeatedly denouncing them and cutting food stamps and unemployment benefits. But last week, Republicans revealed that they also hate hard-working Americans!Comments (59)Amitai EtzioniProfessor of international relations, George Washington UniversityPresident Obama needs to launch a project or two that he can start, develop, and complete successfully -- or, at the very least, projects on which he can make major significant progress. President Reagan had one shining \"city on a hill\" that he was fond of pointing to. Obama has half a dozen.CommentsNicholas TampioAssistant Professor of Political Science, Fordham UniversityPoliticians cannot make the Common Core problem disappear with smoke and mirrors. Sooner or later, most people will admit that the Common Core experiment has failed. Why wait?Comments (15)Greg LouganisFour-time Olympic gold medalist, gay man living with HIV, and activistYou will understand those confusing feelings you are having about \"who you love\" or fall in love with. It is your nature to love, and it is just who you are that you love a man. It is OK. You will survive your suicide attempt, and something glorious will happen.CommentsMatt KepnesAward-winning budget travel site, Nomadic Matt\u0027s Travel SiteBelow are my 27 golden rules for travel.

By doing this, the left has has succumbed to right-wing ideas about social change -- that it comes from great men, rather than collective action.CommentsEmma BrodieWriterWhen I look back at these past few weeks from the quiet future, they will stand out for two reasons. The first is that I had my 25th birthday, and the second is that I lost an apartment I love.CommentsJeff DanzigerPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideCommentsShannon Bradley-CollearyBeauty Maven, Mom Butler, Wife Dominatrix, Slightly MustachioedHeading toward 50 we all have it.
