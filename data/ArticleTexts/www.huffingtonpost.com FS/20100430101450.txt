This is going to make prevention and cleanup much more difficult.Read Post | CommentsRichard Trumka, 04.29.2010President, AFL-CIOOur message is simple: Big Banks tanked our economy and took our money when they needed a bailout.

Such \"solutions\" solve nothing; these are the seeds of resentment.Read Post | CommentsJared Bernstein, 04.29.2010Chief Economist and Economic Policy Adviser to Vice President Joseph BidenElectronics firm SBE, Inc. is a great example of the Recovery Act making the right investment at the right time.

Luis Gutierrez, 04.29.2010CongressmanThe Democrats need to make it crystal clear where we stand on comprehensive immigration reform.

Is the NPT review conference truly succeeding? Ask whether this loophole is closed. My expectation? Don\u0027t hold your breath.Read Post | CommentsDr. Jon LaPook, 04.29.2010Medical correspondent for the CBS Evening News with Katie CouricI watched a nurse in northern Haiti remove a clinic\u0027s only oxygen machine from a premature baby in order to give it to a woman suffering in labor.

Murphy, 04.29.2010Director ACLU Washington Legislative OfficeThe female icons of the civil rights movement are a vanishing species in our collective consciousness.

Whenever we met, she always said, \"Carry on.\"Read Post | CommentsDave Zirin, 04.29.2010Sports correspondent for the Nation MagazineMake no mistake about it: the Diamondbacks protest is catching fire.
