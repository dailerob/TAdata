{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Marty KaplanDirector, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolIf mice can have false memories planted in their brains by scientists, then I guess it shouldn\u0027t be surprising that cultures can have false memories planted in their brains by politicians and their media enablers. What brings this to mind is news of the death of sociologist Robert Bellah, coauthor of a landmark study of American values, Habits of the Heart. When it was published in 1985, it was \"morning in America,\" as Ronald Reagan\u0027s campaign ads had spent millions proclaiming. But Bellah and his collaborators were less sunny than the president. \"Radical individualism\" in America, they wrote, \"may have grown cancerous, ... may be threatening the survival of freedom itself.\" Thanks to generations of hagiographic Republican politicians, and the press\u0027s lazy confusion of partisan mythmaking with historical facts, the retroactive meaning of Reaganism has come to include the triumph of religious faith over secular humanism, family values over hippie hedonism, the market over the state.Comments (296)Jonathan WeilerDirector of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel HillNow that Commissioner Selig has thrown the book at Alex Rodriguez, it is past time for sports media to stop giving a free pass to the man who is most responsible for having allowed the steroid problem to fester for as long as it did -- the commissioner himself.Comments (32)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Instead of spending August on the beach, corporate lobbyists are readying arguments for when Congress returns in September about why corporate taxes should be lowered. But they\u0027re lies. You need to know why so you can spread the truth.Comments (383)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureWhich Jeff Bezos will publish the Washington Post: the anti-tax libertarian or the iconoclastic business thinker? We don\u0027t know. But either way, the plot thickens.CommentsValarie KaurAward-winning filmmaker, speaker, and advocateToday, on the one-year anniversary, we must remember Oak Creek as the largest act of violence on a faith community since the 1963 church bombings.Comments (45)Jack MirkinsonMedia Editor, The Huffington Post\"Let me start with a really tough question,\" the lawyer tells Maggie. Was I the only one who was thinking it would be, \"WHAT\u0027S WITH THE HAIR?\"Comments (67)Carrie GoldmanAuthor, BULLIED: What Every Parent, Teacher, and Kid Needs to Know About Ending the Cycle of FearA mother is only as happy as her least-happy child. I couldn\u0027t get a read on my child, because I couldn\u0027t see her or talk with her. Was the homesickness the defining state of her being right now? Or was she having a grand old time with occasional bouts of homesickness at night?Comments (67)Mike RyanSenior Entertainment Writer, The Huffington PostWill Elysium live up to the expectations set by District 9? As a service, we answer every question that you could possibly have about Elysium.Comments (94)Violeta AyalaBolivian filmmakerWhat Manning, Snowden and Assange did for us is more than the thousands of NGO\u0027s, the United Nations and all those \u0027good-hearted\u0027 organizations have failed to do in a hundred years. These men have given us information.Comments (11)Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Instead of furloughing public employees, the government should be adding new public jobs. Obama\u0027s tour to promote a recovery from the \"middle out\" is a good start, but there is nothing in his agenda that would fundamentally change the pitifully slow recovery.Comments (530)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027President Obama seems to think that the country should be thankful to Larry Summers that we didn\u0027t have another Great Depression. This is like telling little kids that if they don\u0027t eat their spinach the bogeyman will get them.CommentsDr. Michael J. BreusClinical Psychologist; Board Certified Sleep SpecialistIf you are one of the millions who suffer from either Type 2 diabetes or hypertension, you can improve your health and lower your risks if you are properly evaluated for obstructive sleep apnea.Comments (32)John PavleyCTO @ The Huffington Post, BloggerNextLesson is a web app where teachers and parents can get access to pre-designed lesson plans or create their own. It wasn\u0027t created by a 20-year-old to jump on the next big trend. It was created by a couple of dads using the ideas and techniques of high tech to solve a real problem in education.Comments (28)José Ramos-HortaFormer President, East Timor, 1996 Nobel Peace Prize laureateIf the position of Nobel Peace Prize laureate adds authority and force to one\u0027s words, it is better used to encourage calm, dialogue and peaceful resolution than to further polarize.Comments (47)Dr. Chris MartineDavid Burpee Professor at Bucknell UniversityIn any given year, the biggest buzz coming out of the annual national Botany conference is normally among the botanists ourselves. This year, however, we\u0027ve been painted as either the heroic defenders of evolutionary biology or the attackers of Louisiana\u0027s right to worship freely.Comments (75)Mandeep SinghStudent at Columbia UniversityOak Creek was an American tragedy that deeply affects us all. Though the challenges marginalized communities face can be sorrowful, I truly have faith in our nation to collectively take a stance and put an end to these detrimental mentalities.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorAt the bottom of the globalization debate is a fundamental error by the policy, political, and punditry community: the assumption that people are first and last consumers, not workers. But when trade effects prices, it also effects jobs and wages.Comments (14)Dr. Karin L. SmithsonPsychotherapist and spirituality expertAs college doors start to swish and swing open, slurping young people back in for fall classes, I feel compelled to put my hand up and say, \"Wait, you forgot something.\"Comments (29)Conde Nast TravelerCondeNastTraveler.comWe sure do like our clichés in the States. In our annual Readers\u0027 Choice Survey, Southern hospitality shines on that \"friendliness\" front, while a total of five towns in the stereotypically brash Northeast earned spots on the mean-city list.CommentsMatthew DowdPolitical strategistWhat can a simple yet extraordinarily deep man from more than a century ago teach us about our times and us today? Much, it seems to me, after spending time walking in those same woods by Walden last week.Comments (51)Ocean RobbinsAuthor, Speaker, www.foodrevolution.orgAmy Meyer wanted to see for herself where her food was coming from. But in the state of Utah, she discovered, that was against the law.Comments (47)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarWhile there\u0027s no longer a question of whether a woman can succeed in \"a man\u0027s world,\" statistics indicate that either the glass ceiling is thicker and lower than we imagined, or that younger women on the way up are finding a way out. Or, quite possibly, both.Comments (406)Christine PelosiChair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusAt a meeting in chambers with the judge and defense counsel, we discussed scheduling for the afternoon. The judge then looked at me and said words I\u0027ll never forget: \"If he really stalked her, why isn\u0027t she crying?\"Comments (288)Sandy GoodmanRetired producer for NBC Nightly News; freelance writerIt\u0027s a dispute over dollars, a battle one consumer advocate called \"a food fight between two haves at our expense.\"CommentsRana FloridaCEO, The Creative Class Group \u0026 Author, UpgradeThe \"Explainer in Chief\" believes that successful leadership starts by asking the right questions. But great leaders are good listeners too. And while they forge new paths, they also build consensus and \"creative networks of cooperation.\"Comments (312)Rohin DharCo-founder and CEO, PriceonomicsLet\u0027s agree that diamonds are bullsh*t and reject their role in the marriage process. Let\u0027s admit that as a society we got tricked for about a century into coveting sparkling pieces of carbon, but it\u0027s time to end the nonsense.Comments (93)Janice L. MarturanoFounder and Executive Director, Institute for Mindful LeadershipA mindful leader is someone who embodies leadership presence by cultivating focus, clarity, creativity and compassion in the service of others. These innate capabilities of the mind -- focus, clarity, creativity and compassion -- can be trained and strengthened.CommentsPeter Van BurenAuthor, \u0027We Meant Well\u0027 and the upcoming \u0027Ghosts of Tom Joad, A Story of the #99Percent\u0027Even before the Manning trial began, the emerging look of a new America was coming into view. In recent years, weapons, tactics, and techniques developed in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as in the war on terror have begun arriving in \"the homeland.\"Comments (125)Leo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersThe party is so focused on wrangling that it has turned itself into a spandex-wearing professional wrestling cartoon character. Fighting is not what Americans want. They want peace and prosperity. Republicans need to get that message and get to work.Comments (95)Debbie SalamoneCommunications officer, The Pew Charitable TrustsI asked the survivors to band together and travel to the U.S. Capitol and the United Nations to speak about the plight of sharks. The survivors responded enthusiastically because they were ocean lovers before their attacks and because their attitudes hadn\u0027t changed--despite their lost limbs. Nearly all the survivors I contacted understood they were uniquely qualified to help. They were happy to transform a tragedy into something positive.CommentsTrita ParsiPresident, National Iranian American CouncilThe Ahmadinejad era has officially come to an end. Rest assure, few in Iran are mourning this occasion. But questions still remain as to whether the new President, Hassan Rouhani can usher in a new era.
