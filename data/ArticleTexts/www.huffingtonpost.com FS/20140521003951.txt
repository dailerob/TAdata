{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Mark GongloffChief financial writer, The Huffington PostPleading guilty to criminal charges is proving so harsh and damaging to Credit Suisse that its stock price is only up 1 percent Tuesday morning. Must be nice to be too big to truly prosecute. The Swiss bank pleaded guilty Monday evening to conspiring to help U.S. customers evade taxes, the first such guilty plea by a major financial institution in years. Not long ago, prosecutors, regulators, banks and shareholders all feared that having a major bank like Credit Suisse plead guilty could have catastrophic consequences for the bank and the global economy. Now they know better -- everything will be just fine.Love your self, love your work, love the people around you. Dare to love those who are different from you, no matter where they\u0027re from, what they look like, and who they love. Pursue this life of love with focus and passion and ambition and courage. Give it your all. And that will be your path to true success.John LegendRecording artist, concert performer and philanthropistFeminism is an endeavor to change something very old, widespread, and deeply rooted in many, perhaps most, cultures around the world, innumerable institutions, and most households on Earth -- and in our minds, where it all begins and ends.Rebecca SolnitAuthor, \u0027A Paradise Built in Hell\u0027The arts are not the whole solution for education in the 21st century. We need strong leadership, effective teachers and hard work on many fronts. But arts education gives our schools effective tools to reach and teach students.Kerry WashingtonActressIt is hard to imagine that most parents, even in conservative states, are comfortable dining next to a group of people toting large weapons. By distributing photos that show just what that looks like, Moms Demand Action has hit on an effective strategy.Ben HallmanSenior Financial Writer, The Huffington PostThe GOP\u0027s recent efforts to gin up presidential scandals in punitive hearings, media lynchings, and weekly calls for impeachment, evince a party-wide pathology that puts partisanship over patriotism.Robert F.

Doubt, as has been observed, kills more dreams than failure ever will.Parker MantellGraduate of Indiana UniversityThe wrong question is being asked. It is not, can faith exist with science? It is rather, can enchantment be restored in the age of enlightenment?Gary HartUnited States Senator (Ret.)Banks and equity funds that invest in charter schools in underserved areas can take advantage of a very generous tax credit, which they can combine with other tax breaks while they also collect interest on any money they lend out. Doing this, they can double their money in seven years.Alan SingerSocial studies educator, Hofstra UniversityMany of society\u0027s favorite psychoactive compounds, both legal and illegal, work by hijacking our own neurotransmitters and brain receptor sites. In other words, they aren\u0027t creating something out of nothing -- they only work because our brains are set up to get high and feel pleasure.Mark SissonFormer elite marathoner and triathlete; Author, \u0027The Primal Blueprint\u0027You know the feeling. When it hurts to see other people succeed. When you read articles about Mark Zuckerberg, the world\u0027s youngest billionaire.

Nah. It was a genius strategy, I thought, congratulating myself.Brendan LeonardOutdoorsman and author of \u0027The New American Road Trip Mixtape\u0027Conversations about trigger warnings seem more and more like superficial proxies for ones about deeper problems on campuses regarding diversity, equity, the corporatization of education, and, the dreaded word, privilege.Soraya ChemalyFeminist, Writer, Satirist... not always in that orderNo single person or entity has the expertise, resources or reach to effectively address global challenges alone. Instead, it will take a collaborative effort among the public, private and nonprofit sectors to move forward.Anne FinucaneChief Global Strategy and Marketing Officer at Bank of AmericaPresident Obama has only one option -- use every ounce of his authority to unilaterally improve economic security. He is more than willing to work with congressional Republicans, but he is certainly not going to wait for them.Dan PfeifferSenior Advisor to President ObamaBeauty abounds in the most unexpected places, making the minor and mundane suddenly magnificent. The trick is to include yourself in this expanded version of beauty.Lisa SadikmanWriter, tween whisperer, toddler wrangler.A coalition of black pastors filed an amicus brief in Michigan\u0027s gay marriage trial last Wednesday.

RyanPresident and CEO, Covenant HouseSociologists say that unless you\u0027re a tech aficionado, it\u0027s hard to care about government spying that doesn\u0027t affect your daily life. For most white, middle-class people, data gathering seems abstract.
