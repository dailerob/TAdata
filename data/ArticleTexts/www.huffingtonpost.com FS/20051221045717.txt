{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"From americanartifacts.comAPIt\u0027s Day Three of my South Pacific vacation, and I\u0027m still obsessing. But now it\u0027s not about matters of war and peace, civil liberties, and the sorry state of the mainstream media -- it\u0027s about the growing misuse of that puny piece of punctuation called the apostrophe. Okay, I know you\u0027re thinking that the Pacific air has got to me and, instead of gaining perspective, I\u0027m losing it. But hear me out. The phenomenon is spreading so rapidly, it\u0027s practically, well, an apostrodemic.READ POST | comments (121)12.20.2005 RJ EskowAn election driven by religion. A deeply polarized electorate. Disputed voting results, where the only question is whether the fraud was small-scale or massive. Yes,...READ POST | comments (20)12.20.2005 Paul RieckhoffIt is this Pollyanna-esque view of the world, and of the war, that has consistently made it unnecessarily difficult for our military leaders to get the job done.READ POST | comments (20)12.20.2005 Paul KrassnerI would like to present the first annual “Homer Simpson D’oh!

John ConyersMy new report concludes that a number of the administration\u0027s actions amount to prima facie evidence that federal criminal laws have been violated. Legal violations span from false statements to Congress to whistleblower laws.READ POST | comments (101)12.20.2005 Geoffrey R. StoneBush apparently believes that the evil-doers assume we act within the bounds of our own Constitution. So, we’ll trick them. We won’t.READ POST | comments (45)12.20.2005 Toby BarlowDear Holiday Celebrants: There is growing concern amongst some of us that the “Christians” are now celebrating the birth of their deity right around (or on!) December 25.READ POST | comments (35)12.19.2005 Kristen BreitweiserPresident Bush should be stopped in his tracks with regard to his use of 9/11 scare tactics to circumvent constitutional laws that are meant to protect U.S. citizens.READ POST | comments (56)12.20.2005 Bob BurnettAccording to the President there are only two positions on terrorists: One is to continue to fight them in Iraq. The other is to “leave them alone.” The choice is between “victory” and “defeat.”READ POST | comments (27)12.20.2005 Cenk Uygurt\u0027s not that he violated a federal statute -- he\u0027s done that before. It\u0027s not that he circumvented the constitution -- he\u0027s been there before. It\u0027s his defense that makes this case stand out so much.READ POST | comments (56)12.19.2005 Aaron FreemanCould somebody please stop the spread of democracy in the Middle East? I do not like the way it\u0027s turning out. Iran for example has been having elections for almost thirty years, and look who wins them.READ POST | comments (16)12.20.2005 Norman SolomonThe P.U.-litzer Prizes recognize the stinkiest media performances of the year. In 2005, a large volume of strong competitors made the selection process very difficult.READ POST | comments (16)12.19.2005 Michael ShawGiven the nature of the Administration, one might also consider that the Iraqi is just a prop. Judging by uniforms, insignias and appearance, it\u0027s not clear there is another Iraqi soldier in the whole room.READ POST | comments (21)12.19.2005 Steven G.
