{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Bill MaherHost of HBO\u0027s \"Real Time with Bill Maher\"Everything Republicans say can\u0027t or won\u0027t work -- gun control, immigration reform, high-speed rail -- California is making work. And everything conservatives claim will unravel the fabric of our society -- universal healthcare, higher taxes on the rich, gay marriage, medical marijuana -- has only made California stronger. And all we had to do to accomplish that was vote out every single Republican. Without a Republican governor and without a legislature being cock-blocked by Republicans, a $27 billion deficit was turned into a surplus, continuing the proud American tradition of Republicans blowing a huge hole in the budget and then Democrats coming in and cleaning it up.Comments (2,481)Diane BenscoterAuthor, \u0027Shoes of a Servant\u0027Extremism has become a sensationalized catchall phrase, often used by politicians and mass media to polarize and to label groups of people as \"the bad guys.\" But, what is extremism? And how do we get to the root of its destructiveness?Comments (112)Rep. Charles RangelRepresentative from the 13th Congressional District in New YorkI\u0027ve been around Congress long enough to know there are issues we may never see eye-to-eye from the opposite aisle, but we should all agree that our job is to move America forward and benefit the people. It\u0027s irresponsible to play games and handcuff the process so that nothing gets done at all.Comments (175)Victor StengerPhysicist, PhD, bestselling authorFaith would not be such a negative force in society if it were just about religion. However, the magical thinking that becomes deeply ingrained whenever blind faith rules over facts warps all areas of life.Comments (200)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesWhat many people don\u0027t understand is that in Italy what Barilla said is, sadly, too often perfectly acceptable. He was speaking on an Italian radio program. He was likely oblivious to how it would play globally, and probably not very conscious of how the rights and conditions of LGBT people, and the role of women, have changed dramatically in the rest of the industrialized West.Comments (69)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundJaime, Katie, and La\u0027Mont are three young servant leaders whose stories we are celebrating as part of our 40th anniversary celebration. They are a reminder that we must never ever give up on any child.CommentsSen. Kirsten GillibrandU.S. Senator from New YorkWe know the American workforce is changing at a rapid pace as families rely more and more on women\u0027s income to get by. But, as the face of the American workplace has changed, the federal rules that govern it have not kept up.Comments (17)JJ KeithWriter www.jjkeith.netThis tendency for vaccinating parents to stay out of the discussion is what\u0027s causing vaccination to lose its bandwagon appeal. Anti-vaxers are loud. The rest of us need to be loud too, because there\u0027s nothing crunchy about a resurgence of polio.Comments (1,475)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorWhether it is the debate about intervention in the civil war in Syria or the signing of an arms trade treaty, the role of the UN on the world stage is far too often reduced to that of the intermediary between world powers -- or it is ridiculed or maligned by grand-standing American politicians.CommentsAdam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; founder of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911We are a confident generation, which is a good thing. But when it comes to the way we manage our financial lives -- particularly our credit -- that confidence can make us vulnerable.Comments (18)Robin WilkeyEditor, The Huffington Post San FranciscoA reporter once wrote that sports train us for the heartbreaks of real life without imposing any actual consequences. That\u0027s the beauty of the game: there\u0027s always next year. But there is no next year for Jonathan Denver. And this is what\u0027s robbing sports of everything good.CommentsLisa KerrCreator, \u0027My Cult Life\u0027What makes a bright young woman join a cult and sacrifice her life to someone else\u0027s dreams? For starters, nobody joins a \"cult.\" From the outside Master\u0027s Commission looked like the quickest path to change the world.Comments (12)Kia MakarechiEntertainment Editor, The Huffington PostWe live in a world where countless celebrities have engaged in horrific acts of domestic violence and continue to work, and yet America is upset about a visionary creative who doesn\u0027t always say the politically correct thing.Comments (327)Bob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowHow many are \"enough?\" How many \"good guys?\" How many guns? Indeed, there will never be enough \"good guys with guns\" for LaPierre\u0027s taste, chiefly because the NRA\u0027s sole mission is to sell as many guns as they can.Comments (716)Jackson BrowneSinger/SongwriterThe problem is not the things we like, it\u0027s the way we do business. It\u0027s the way huge corporations handle distributing goods, maximizing profits. We absolutely have the power to turn this around, to whatever extent that we really want to turn it around.CommentsMeghan RalstonHarm Reduction Manager, Drug Policy AllianceIt\u0027s easy to focus on the sensational aspects of the emerging krokodil \"flesh-rotting drug\" story, but that ignores the most troubling issues around its origins, its popularity and its continued use.CommentsJim Yong KimPresident, World Bank GroupYou might not believe it, but extreme poverty is in retreat. If the world can avoid becoming complacent and keep momentum on the side of the poor, there\u0027s a real opportunity to end extreme poverty within a generation -- this generation.CommentsAlan SingerSocial studies educator, Hofstra UniversityIt turns out students in Los Angeles really are smarter than school board members and two of Americans largest and most powerful corporations.CommentsCecile RichardsPresident of Planned Parenthood Federation of America and Planned Parenthood Action FundToday, Planned Parenthood, the ACLU and the Center for Reproductive Rights filed a lawsuit in federal court to stop the Texas law that would drastically reduce access to safe and legal abortion for many women from taking effect.CommentsPeter DreierE.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeOn Tuesday, during his 21-hour marathon \"filibuster\" against Obamacare, Senator Ted Cruz read aloud to his daughters back home the Dr. Seuss book Green Eggs and Ham. But he clearly missed its message. To commemorate the occasion, I wrote this poem.CommentsKim SimonMother, Wife, Blogger, mamabythebay.comIf you cover because it makes YOU feel better, then by all means keep covering up. I support you. But if you cover to make OTHER PEOPLE feel better, well then sister, come sit by me and we\u0027ll nurse in public together.Comments (176)Eliyahu FedermanCivil rights activist, writer and SVP, CCO of 1SaleADayIt was either the modern unknown world, or their family. If they chose not to return, their family would disown them. Leaving their loved ones behind was not seen as an option. Sadly, that is the definition of a cult.CommentsJeff KlimaAuthor, The Dead Janitors ClubSo desperate and hungry were people for accessible fiction that \"speaks their language,\" they turned a bastardized Twilight f**kfest fan-fiction turnip into a pop culture phenomenon. Imagine how well something as sexy as a contemporary Tropic of Cancer or Lolita would do in this day and age?CommentsMichael E. MannDirector of Penn State Earth System Science Center; Author of \u0027Dire Predictions\u0027 and \u0027The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars\u0027Never underestimate the inventiveness of climate-change deniers. Where there\u0027s a will, there is, indeed, a way.Comments (117)Ericka AndersenSenior Digital Communications Associate, The Heritage FoundationCrossFit haters like to blame CrossFit as a whole -- call it a cult, label people as \"weird\" or \"obsessed.\" Folks will say CrossFit causes injury and is irresponsible. Newsflash: CrossFit does not cause injury -- individuals do things that cause themselves injury.Comments (95)RoadtrippersDiscover Your AmericaWhat better way to reminisce about Walter White\u0027s journey from Mr. Chips to Scarface than to follow in the steps of Heisenberg on this Breaking Bad Road Trip? Here\u0027s our guide to the most iconic Breaking Bad locations.CommentsRep. Carolyn MaloneyU.S. Representative for New York\u0027s 12th District; Ranking House Member, Joint Economic CommitteeAt our country\u0027s pace of job creation, it would take more than seven years to fully recover all the jobs that were lost in the Great Recession. That is just not acceptable.CommentsJayanti TammAuthor, \u0027Cartwheels in a Sari: A Memoir of Growing Up Cult\u0027Are they victims? Only those on the outside and ex-members view them that way. To the devout, the concept that they are \u0027victims\u0027 is a direct insult. How can they be victims when they have chosen their path?CommentsLinda WolffBlogger, Carpool GoddessThe five days I didn\u0027t have Internet access at home were painful and strangely wonderful -- just not at the same time. It all started one morning when I went to my desk, coffee in hand, as I always do, to start my day. A few clicks and nothing. No bars. No Safari. Nothing.Comments (28)Nathan J. WinogradDirector, No Kill Advocacy CenterWe now have a proven solution to shelter killing and it is not difficult, expensive nor beyond practical means to achieve. And the large national animal protection groups should be working feverishly to ensure that the model is replicated in every community in the country. But they are not.Comments (12)Bob BurnettBerkeley writer, retired Silicon Valley executiveThe president may not have done a good job selling Obamacare but he\u0027s done enough to push it across the starting line. And once Americans understand Obamacare they are going to like it. That\u0027s bad news for Republicans.CommentsMichelle Chen, 2013.27.09Morgan Guyton, 2013.27.09Budget Travel, 2013.27.09Imbibe, 2013.27.09Andrew Arakawa, 2013.27.09Nancy Rappaport, 2013.27.09Tony Loftis, 2013.27.09Gordy Grundy, 2013.27.09Dr. Jane Aronson, 2013.27.09Neda Najibi, 2013.27.09Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"SPEAKER CRUZ?",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechnologyYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
