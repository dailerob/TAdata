What has occurred there is but the next chapter in a centuries-old American narrative in which unarmed Black women and men are killed in the custody of police officers. Multitudes have protested peacefully in Baltimore and around the nation. Yet, a question now arises as to what should be done in response to the violent protests presently unfolding on the streets.

And today that tone is more honest and authentic than ever before.Freelance Writer and Stand-Up ComedianBruce Jenner said he was afraid of \"disappointing people.\" Bruce, have no fear -- you didn\u0027t.

The true state of emergency now, like back in 1968, isn\u0027t rage or even rock throwing. It is the racial profiling and racial brutality of the police. America\u0027s real state of emergency remains that black lives still don\u0027t matter enough.Historian writing on the history, politics, and current impact of incarceration in AmericaDo you think \"vacation\" equals Las Vegas resort or New York City adventure?
