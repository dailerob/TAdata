{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027House Speaker John Boehner says raising the minimum wage is \"bad policy\" because it will cause job losses. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce says a minimum wage increase would be a job killer. Republicans and the Chamber also say unions are job killers, workplace safety regulations are job killers, environmental regulations are job killers, and the Affordable Care Act is a job killer. The California Chamber of Commerce even publishes an annual list of \"job killers,\" including almost any measures that lift wages or protect workers and the environment. Most of this is bunk. When in 1996 I recommended the minimum wage be raised, Republicans and the Chamber screamed it would \"kill jobs.\" In fact, in the four years after it was raised, the U.S. economy created more jobs than were ever created in any four-year period.Comments (411)TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"In this incredibly moving talk, waitress-turned-equal-rights-advocate Ash Beckham shares a story about how a little girl\u0027s innocence stopped her in her tracks. See what this profound encounter reveals about finding the courage to be yourself and to say the things you never thought you could say.Comments (121)Mark GongloffChief financial writer, The Huffington PostWhen you read that story recently about the Burger King customers who were insulted on their order receipt, you may have felt shock, outrage and sympathy for the customers. I felt a little of that, but something else, too: I felt empathy for the employee who typed up the receipt and then got fired over it.Comments (273)Beth LeybaCommunity activist, writer, student, momI am somebody. I have value. I am working, even if it\u0027s barely enough to get by. I will simply keep doing the best I can for my children, and I will continue feeding homeless youth even as I struggle to put food on my own table.Comments (153)Arianna HuffingtonAhn-nyong-ha-seh-yo from Seoul. I\u0027m here for the launch of HuffPost Korea, which marks the 11th country where The Huffington Post\u0027s hybrid approach to journalism -- as a hub for original reporting and a blogging platform for a range of voices, both new and established -- is expanding the worldwide conversation.CommentsKia MakarechiSenior Editor for Mobile and Innovations, The Huffington PostThe debate over gentrification is in full-swing again after Spike Lee weighed in. His critics are calling him racist for ripping \u0027hipsters.\" They\u0027re wrong.Comments (66)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarThere is an argument that the Internet makes us smarter, makes us faster, makes us more connected; it also appears to be making us meaner; especially in the warren of social media.CommentsMina SohnEditor-at-large, HuffPost KoreaHuffPost Korea will, above all, change the tone of existing news and suggest measures to recognize problems and improve them cheerfully and intelligently. Breaking social prejudice and dissolving journalistic hierarchies, it intends to convey the reader the \"real\" news of life in which all of us are the hosts and main characters.CommentsJames ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu never tires of inventing new hoops through which he insists Palestinians jump. As he acknowledged a few weeks back, it\u0027s all part of a cynical game that he plays in an effort to kill the chances for peace.CommentsVictor StengerPhysicist, PhD, bestselling authorReligious debaters are usually very smooth and well prepared. The reason is not that their arguments are so persuasive but that they generally have spent years polishing the same old arguments.Comments (442)Martha BurkMoney Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsIf you look only at the categories for acting, women come in for an equal share of the Oscars, and are often held in higher esteem than the men. But peeking behind the velvet curtains, the scene shifts.CommentsWilliam DameronWriter and Blogger, \u0027The Authentic Life\u0027Eventually I worked up enough courage to come out to my older brother Chuck, who lived seven hundred miles away. I sat on the floor of my basement apartment bedroom and dialed his number, each time hanging up before the first ring. On the fourth try I let the call complete.CommentsMarian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundThroughout much of her long life Mrs. Clark was often at odds with South Carolina leaders and made other enemies as she traveled throughout the Deep South pioneering literacy and citizenship education for black Americans.CommentsKuoth WielSouth Sudanese model and actorWomen make up over 60 percent of South Sudan\u0027s population and they make up the majority of those suffering. Despite the fact that the conflict is the result of political divisions within the South Sudan government, these women and all those who are suffering, displaced and hungry do not care about politics.CommentsRalph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorShort of a mass popular resurgence, how can we break free of this destructive cycle of same-old bought and sold elections and tired rhetoric that ultimately leads to gridlock government?Comments (27)Philip K. HowardAuthor, \u0027The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America\u0027America now ranks 20th in the world in ease of starting a business, and probably close to last in ease of rebuilding infrastructure. But this is because of the massive accretion of obsolete laws and regulations, not the new ones.CommentsChristopher Rosen and Mike Hogan12 Years a Slave, Gravity and American Hustle are vying for this year\u0027s Best Picture honors. Let\u0027s figure out which one wins.Comments (27)Jack MirkinsonSenior Media Editor, The Huffington PostThis is a film in which the true hero of the AIDS movement is a straight bigot who helps educate all of the queer people he once despised about how to treat themselves and fight the system. In its haste to canonize Ron Woodroof, McConaughey\u0027s character, it almost entirely erases the real saints of the AIDS movement: the men and women of the LGBT community who saved their own lives.Comments (55)Judy AppelExecutive director of Our Family CoaltionThe battle for acceptance is not solely taking place in the courts, but also at playgrounds, little league games, chess tournaments and in churches, synagogues, mosques, everywhere LGBT families are quietly going about the business of raising children and living their lives.Comments (29)BustleNews, entertainment, lifestyle siteThis was reality TV, and unlike the actors I was used to interviewing, I wasn\u0027t playing a character, I was playing myself. Or so I thought.CommentsJim WallisChristian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersDiffering theological views on important issues of sexuality will need time, patience, deep biblical reflection, respectful discourse, and religious liberty to be worked out in the churches. But the perception of Christian faith is in grave danger when Christians try to use the law to publicly discriminate against those who don\u0027t adhere to their point of view.Comments (42)Suzanne FleetWriter behind the award-winning blog, Toulouse \u0026 Tonic,Plant deep within him the knowledge that showing affection is a sign of strength, not weakness.CommentsChris WeigantPolitical writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comEven when Republicans weren\u0027t shooting at their own feet this week, it appears they were conducting a circular firing squad instead. The 2014 campaign, in other words, is off to a raucous start... and it\u0027s only February.CommentsEm \u0026 LoThe Emily Posts of the modern bedroomThis year\u0027s crop of best acting nominees in the lead and supporting roles somehow manage to represent the archetypes of every person you\u0027ve ever dated. To wit...CommentsRay HalbritterOneida Indian Nation Representative; CEO, Oneida Nation EnterprisesSometimes you have to listen for the silences to understand what is actually being said. The NFL is considering penalties against players if they utter one of the most despicable racial slurs against African Americans.Comments (13)Valerie JarrettSenior Advisor to the President and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsWith her slight build, distinctly precise diction, and relentless energy, Representative Shirley Chisholm of New York will be forever remembered for the ground she broke in Congress, and the ground she laid for millions of women, girls, and African Americans in this country.CommentsCecile RichardsPresident of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, \u0026 Planned Parenthood VotesIt\u0027s clear that this bill isn\u0027t about religious liberties. It\u0027s about corporations who want a license to discriminate against people by denying services, taking away birth control coverage, and blocking access to health care. If Governor Jan Brewer can see that this is way too extreme, surely the U.S. Supreme Court can, too.Comments (65)Vanessa CullinsVice President for External Medical Affairs, Planned Parenthood Federation of AmericaMarch 31 is just around the corner and Planned Parenthood staff and volunteers are working double time to ensure our patients and the communities we serve have information about new, more affordable health insurance plans available to them thanks to the Affordable Care Act.CommentsLauren LubinExecutive producer, \u0027We Exist\u0027\"Gender binary\" describes our current belief system that gender exists as only male or female.

BreusClinical Psychologist; Board Certified Sleep SpecialistBad dreams and nightmares are among the most startling and emotionally potent of remembered dreams. Even a partially remembered disturbing dream can linger in our waking minds. But what do we know about this phenomenon of disturbed dreaming? And what\u0027s the difference between a bad dream and a nightmare?CommentsTim SackettHR and recruiting proHello. My name is Tim Sackett, and I\u0027m a hugger. Being a hugger can make for some awkward moments -- what if the other person isn\u0027t expecting a hug, or doesn\u0027t want one, and you\u0027re coming in arms-wide-open!?Comments (20)John Feffer, 2014. 1.03Jamie Henn, 2014. 1.03Eric White, 2014. 1.03Roger I.
