{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonOne of the first people who came to mind when I heard the news last week that Jeff Bezos was buying the Washington Post was a fellow countryman, the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, who around 2,500 years ago said, \"No man ever steps in the same river twice.” Or as James Fallows put it, the sale was \"one of those episode-that-encapsulates-an-era occurrences.\" This combining of the best of traditional media with the boundless potential of digital media represents an amazing opportunity to further move the conversation away from the future of newspapers to the future of journalism -- in whatever form it\u0027s delivered. The future will definitely be a hybrid one, combining the best practices of traditional journalism with the best tools available to the digital world. Jeff Bezos has already changed the definition of what retail is; our definition of what constitutes news could use the same level of rethinking.Comments (24)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Comments (554)Keli GoffAuthor and Special Correspondent, TheRoot.comIf women are looking to achieve anything close to the myth known as \"having it all,\" the more children they have, the harder it will be.

Co-founder, GenerationFabulous.comMy 21-year-old son, who can sometimes surprise me with his level of maturity -- I still think of him as a goofy 8-year-old far too often -- has opted out of a 21st birthday celebration in Las Vegas with some of his friends.Comments (162)Ferrett SteinmetzScience fiction writerI refuse to perpetuate, even through the plausible deniability of humor, the idea that the people my daughter is attracted to are my enemy.Comments (262)Ken ReedSports Policy Director, League of FansThe NCAA has delegated the concussion issue to schools as a strategy to avoid any legal liability and potential financial losses. Meanwhile, the NCAA continues to rake in billions of dollars from television and other sources through its revenue-at-all-costs policies.Comments (16)Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoThe American judiciary exists, first and foremost, to protect the constitutional rights of those who are not in the majority. It exists to ensure that our government treats all of us with respect.Comments (708)Carl Elliott, M.D., Ph.D.Professor, Center for Bioethics, University of MinnesotaImagine that you lose your only son to suicide in a medical experiment. When you try to get his study records, the university refuses. When you file suit, the university argues successfully in court that it is \"immune.\" Believe it or not, these are the actions taken by the University of Minnesota.CommentsThought CatalogOnline Magazine for People Passionate About CultureAside from celebrating your own face and lunch, Instagram is used for bragging about your social life.

Then again, perhaps that\u0027s the point.Comments (90)Mike RyanSenior Entertainment Writer, The Huffington PostJim Carrey was probably right to denounce \"Kick-Ass 2.\"Comments (239)Carey PolisEditor, HuffPost FoodI don\u0027t want lifestyle blogs or glossy magazines to go away -- I just sometimes wish that the definition of \"lifestyle\" could encompass more quirks, mistakes, imperfections and stains.Comments (37)Adam WexlerFounder and Chief Strategy Officer, InsightpoolIt was tough to miss the excellent piece penned by 13-year-old Ruby Karp this week. As she explained in her Mashable post, Facebook is struggling to resonate with the next teenage generation. Funny thing is I agree with almost everything she says.Comments (11)John BeckerManaging Editor, The Bilerico ProjectThe Russian government owns or is a major shareholder in most of Russia\u0027s television stations, so every time Procter \u0026 Gamble purchases an ad on those networks, the company puts money into the pockets of the Russian government and finances Putin\u0027s bloody crusade against LGBT people.Comments (137)Katie HurleyChild and Adolescent Psychotherapist, Parenting ExpertLife is far too scripted today.
