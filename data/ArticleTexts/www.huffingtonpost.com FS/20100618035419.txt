{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"New York Editor-At-Large of The Huffington PostRemember 9/11, Mr. President. There are lessons there for the oil spill crisis, and not the ones you might imagine. The frustration and anger from the Gulf Coast are understandable. Everybody shares it. Particularly when we hear stories that suggest the government isn\u0027t doing all it can to protect the coast, the beaches, the wildlife and the fishing industry from the effects of the spill. But for those of us who lived through the aftermath of Sept. 11, the story of the emergency responders has a chilling familiarity.Read Post | CommentsJim Wallis, 06.17.2010Christian leader for social changeThis week, in Obama\u0027s Oval Office speech on the oil spill, he used the term \"mission.\" That\u0027s the right word. It will take a purposeful commitment to a mission of change to truly respond to the epiphany in the Gulf.Read Post | CommentsJason Linkins, 06.17.2010CNN has talked to a \"language analyst\" who reported that Obama was too \"professorial.\" To \"connect\" with Americans, Obama should have said: \"OIL GO BOOM!

It wouldn\u0027t have hurt. But it would have been mostly ignored.Read Post | CommentsMichael Kieschnick, 06.17.2010President of CREDO MobileAs the old song goes: which side are you on? Rep. Joe Barton\u0027s not on our side, that\u0027s for sure. After taking more than $1.4 million in political contributions from the oil industry, he apologized to BP\u0027s CEO for his company\u0027s troubles.Read Post | CommentsErich Pica, 06.17.2010President, Friends of the EarthThe tough questions deservedly piled on BP\u0027s CEO at today\u0027s hearing will ring hollow if committee members don\u0027t also ask this tough question of themselves: Whose interests are they serving?
