{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Doug BandowSenior Fellow, the Cato InstituteI don\u0027t expect very much from Santa Claus these days. I mean, he\u0027s been a disappointment over the years. My desires are few--power, money, and fame, that sort of thing--but he\u0027s yet to satisfy any of them. So I tried downgrading my requests to world peace and the end of international poverty. But that didn\u0027t work either. He still didn\u0027t deliver. This year I tried to be more realistic. I had just a few simple requests. It\u0027s been a difficult year so Santa, this would have been a good time to give me at least something that I wanted. But no! It\u0027s Christmas Day and I got up early to check under the tree, and nothing.Comments (11)Diane RavitchHistorian, NYU professorWhen I go with my partner to midnight Mass, I am glad I know the words to the songs. I look around and am not surprised to see a fairly large number of other Jews from the neighborhood, also joining in singing the songs with the choir. It is Christmas. It is a time to celebrate peace and joy and goodwill towards all. We can all share those hopes.CommentsJulie TarneyWriterMy heart swelled as I patted Harry\u0027s head. He was happy, and so was I. Because while too many people questioned my young son\u0027s preferences, and therefore my skills as a mother, we both stood strong with a cartoon rabbit who carried an anvil in his pink purse.CommentsLinda BergtholdHealth policy researcherIf you did not sign up for health insurance by Christmas Eve this year, you are not out of luck. You can still get insured. With all the news about the Obamacare website, the deadlines, the delays, you would think that would be clear. But it could not be more confusing.Comments (46)Padmini ParthasarathyJournalist based in New York, NYI was raised an American Hindu who feels more nostalgia for December pine in New York than October sulfur in Mumbai. I didn\u0027t think I would see a Christmas tree this year. And this one was startlingly alive, outside, swaying between private mourning and public celebration.CommentsConde Nast TravelerCondeNastTraveler.comWe are going to hell for thinking these photos are so funny.CommentsGeoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoAfter examining the evidence provided by the NSA, the Review Group concluded that the information obtained through the section 215 telephony meta-data program had not proved necessary to the prevention of any planned terrorist attack since the program\u0027s inception in 2006.Comments (12)Rev. Kenneth TannerPastor, Holy Redeemer; WriterHow can gratitude for this gift be confined to a day or a season? Every moment -- all our breaths -- ought to resound with praise for this radical identification of God with us.CommentsFarai ChideyaMultimedia journalist and authorA lot has been written about interfaith families and how they blend or respect traditions. But you don\u0027t have to be in a relationship to be interfaith. We all grow and evolve. How do we relate to the divine, if we choose not to do it in the way we once did as a child?CommentsViatorTours and activities around the worldSanta Claus, Father Christmas, Papa Noel, Saint Nicholas -- whatever name you want to call the rotund man in the red suit, it\u0027s hard to deny the magnetic charms of everyone\u0027s favorite Christmas character.CommentsBlake KernenA 8th grader from Morristown-Beard School, New JerseyMy younger brother found out that those presents under the tree don\u0027t come from Santa\u0027s workshop; they come from the mall. Shock, disbelief and disappointment quickly set in.CommentsJulie Kuriakose, M.D.Dual board-certified in allergy and immunology and internal medicineSeasonal allergies don\u0027t need to ruin your holiday season. Being prepared and taking precaution can go a long way in the fight against your allergies.CommentsMicah J. MurrayBlogger at RedemptionPictures.comIt\u0027s the same every year, and if I\u0027m completely honest with myself, I\u0027m disappointed. Christmas isn\u0027t going to complete me. It can\u0027t. And it doesn\u0027t have to. I\u0027m learning that this is okay.CommentsWhitney CaudillAssociate Dean, Manchester University \u0026 Blogger, It is pretty.Needless to say, it is easy to focus on the negatives of being single at the holidays. But the truth is that it isn\u0027t all bad. In fact, I believe there is a strong argument that it is better, or at least more fun, to be single during the holidays.CommentsMarilyn SewellUnitarian Univeralist minister, writerEach year my tree, still graced with these gathered, given ornaments, reminds me of the abundance of love in the universe, and challenges me to keep my heart ever open to receive.CommentsJJ VirginFitness/Nutrition Expert, Author of NY Times Bestseller The Virgin Diet.For most of us, optimal mood begins with the right foods. These mood-boosting foods can subtly but powerfully brighten your outlook, reduce stress, and boost feel-good hormones to help you not only cope but thrive during the hectic holiday season and beyond.CommentsToni NagyBlogger, tonibologna.comAs I frantically search Amazon for the perfect Lady Bug costume that isn\u0027t too itchy, has antennas and comes with a tutu (but not a black one, only red), I can\u0027t help but feel conflicted. Gifts are a huge part of the exhilaration children feel at Christmas, but I don\u0027t want it to be limited to that.CommentsLana Gorlinski15-year-old sophomore from Orange County, CaliforniaFor one month, it becomes socially acceptable to be as childish and unapologetically corny as possible. In an age of modernism, it\u0027s refreshing to bask in nonsensical whimsy and tradition.CommentsJana Lee FrazierFormer zookeeper, wildlife biologist and rehabilitatorFor us, the holiday evolved from and revolved around the Christmas tree. But the trip, the many trips, to find the right tree were for my mother only an excuse to shamelessly, obscenely revel in the pure pleasure of nature.CommentsRobert CreamerPolitical Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersOver the last decade the far right, that now dominates the GOP, has conducted a real war on the values that we celebrate at Christmas.Comments (254)Michael HurtPhotographer, ProfessorChristmas is one of the most successfully marketed holidays of the year and also the most lucrative for retailers and a great boost for the consumer economy. For Koreans, it is also the most fun.CommentsJeffrey LaurentiInternational affairs analyst and commentatorIncomprehensibly, John Kerry was not on Time\u0027s short list. The U.S. secretary of state may not deal with cosmic truths, but by any secular standard Kerry has, in one short year, justifiably laid claim to the blessings the gospels promise to peacemakers.CommentsTrevor TimmExecutive Director, Freedom of the Press FoundationEvery American should be outraged that leakers and whistleblowers are being prosecuted under an espionage statute without ever having to show they meant to harm the U.S. or that any harm actually occurred.Comments (102)Sukey ForbesAuthor, The Angel in My PocketI will take care of the presents under the tree but when you pop down our chimney on Christmas Eve if you could place in our stockings a certain santa-je-ne-sais-quoi that fills each of us with the desire and ability to be our kindest, best, most generous selves every day that would be the greatest gift of all.CommentsGary HartUnited States Senator (Ret.)Safe landings are not news; crashes are news. But we must not be left without hope. For many of us, what makes life worthwhile is to focus on safe landings and those who make a difference every day, every year. Today my heart is full of gratitude for the lives of a surprising number of heroes I have been privileged to know.CommentsIsiah ThomasNBA Hall of FamerWe owe it to our children and ourselves to demand higher expectations and a system where all stakeholders, from the state house to the school house are held accountable when it comes to education.Comments (12)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorHealth coverage is not cheap, because health care is not cheap. In the interest of sustainability, we have to implement some version of reform to squeeze inefficiencies out of the system. Some will pay more, though they will often get more coverage for their extra bucks. Many -- post subsidy -- will pay less.Comments (313)Rep. Barbara LeeU.S. Representative, California\u0027s 13th congressional districtI know firsthand how important this type of assistance can be to families on the edge. In the 1970s, when I was a student trying to raise two boys as a single mother, I was on public assistance. I know I would not be where I am today as a member of Congress if it were not for the generosity that the American people.Comments (45)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Congress and the president have decided to craft budgets that lead to tens of millions of people being unemployed or underemployed.Comments (246)Brie DyasThis is it, guys. The last weekend before Christmas. Malls are open until midnight. There\u0027s an abnormal surplus of \"safe\" last-minute gifts (read: robes, commemorative ornaments and off-brand bath sets) in the front of every store. And everyone you encounter is pretty much a jerk.Comments (80)Margaret SullivanFreelance writerFor us, Santa has many faces and comes in many guises. And, Megyn, if you need yours to be a white, \u0027Twas-the-night-before-Christmas Santa, fine. That\u0027s what you need. He\u0027s that way for you. Others of us see him other ways. They all work.CommentsCatherine Clinch, 2013.25.12Padmini Parthasarathy, 2013.25.12Bill Burnett, 2013.25.12Julie Tarney, 2013.25.12Paula H.
