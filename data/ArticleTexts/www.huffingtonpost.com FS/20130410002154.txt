{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonLast week, President Obama proposed an initiative to map the complete structure and activity of the brain. \"As humans we can identify galaxies light-years away,\" he said. \"We can study particles smaller than an atom, but we still haven\u0027t unlocked the mystery of the three pounds of matter that sits between our ears.\" I\u0027m all in favor of the effort, especially if it can unlock one particular mystery of those three pounds that was very much in evidence in the days following the president\u0027s proposal: How can the human brain not perceive something that\u0027s right in front of it? I\u0027m talking about the massive jobs crisis in which the country remains mired. You might think that, given the obviousness of our most urgent economic problem, the president\u0027s budget -- details of which were released only a few hours after the jobs numbers -- would naturally focus on this problem. But if that\u0027s what you thought, then the three pounds of matter between your ears led you astray.Comments (61)Russell BrandActor and comedianWhen I was a kid, Thatcher was the headmistress of our country. Her voice, a bellicose yawn, somehow both boring and boring -- I could ignore the content but the intent drilled its way in. I am, safe to say, one of Thatcher\u0027s children. How then do I feel on this day of matriarchal mourning?Comments (165)Robert CreamerPolitical Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersAmerica is not broke. We are not in a time of \"scarcity\" and when we buy into this fallacy, we contribute to political decisions that actually will do damage to our standard of living and that of our children.Comments (957)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistIf your nose is itchy and running as you read this, don\u0027t just reach for a tissue -- pour yourself a cup of peppermint tea, too. I\u0027ll explain. For all of the wonderful things that come with spring -- the sun, the flowers, the singing birds, even the spring cleaning -- there is one aspect of the season that is not so wonderful: allergies!Comments (24)Shelley EmlingEditor, Post 50So what are some things one should never say to one\u0027s dearly beloved? After speaking with Grossman, as well as with some other relationship experts, Huff/Post50 came up with the following list of nine things to never say to your spouse.Comments (552)David CoatesWorrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsWe are told that Obama\u0027s budget will trade \"modest entitlement savings\" for immediate tax hikes on the corporate rich. If that is so, the trade that will be proposed tomorrow will reflect poor judgment -- poor moral judgment, poor economic judgment and poor political judgment.Comments (23)Sarah JenksFounder of Live More Weigh LessSo many of us have been taught that we need to \"weigh less in order to live more,\" but I really believe we have to live more in order to weigh less. We have to stop waiting on the weight and start having fun -- only then will we finally stop being a slave to food and get out of body jail.Comments (30)Ken Dychtwald Ph.D.Gerontologist, psychologist, author, entrepreneur and public speakerHow will the boomers\u0027 desire to stay socially engaged give rise to a revolution in mentoring, volunteering and philanthropreneuring? What are the personal, social and financial challenges of each of the five stages of retirement.CommentsBarbara Bush and Maimunat Alex-AdeomiWe recognize the work of mothers worldwide who ensure their families receive the vital and necessary care they need to live full and healthy lives. In turn, the global community should offer the support needed to these women.CommentsJamie MalanowskiAuthor of \u0027The Book of Levon: The Trials and Triumphs of Levon Helm\u0027Roger Ebert, Levon Helm, Sixto Rodriquez -- models of stoicism. They are men who met disappointment and worse, and faced their challenges with determination and courage. We used to have a lot of role models like them.CommentsRobert NaimanPolicy Director, Just Foreign PolicySay what you want about President Obama\u0027s proposal to cut Social Security and veterans\u0027 benefits with the \"chained CPI.\" He did accomplish one thing for liberals that they often have a hard time doing on their own. He united them -- in opposition to his proposal.Comments (27)David LandselContributing editor at Airfarewatchdog.comAnd where you should go instead.Comments (1,011)Allison TateAuthor, mother of fourHow do I raise my baby girl to love -- or, at the very least, not to hate -- the same features I have picked apart for so long?Comments (16)Sen. Patty MurrayU.S. Senator from WashingtonParents, seniors, business owners, and workers are already sharing experiences with their elected leaders that make it clear sequestration must be replaced. And these stories are changing the one that\u0027s being told in Washington, D.C.CommentsAdam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; founder of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911Stealing a tax refund is one of the most direct ways for an identity thief to monetize the information they steal. And it\u0027s way too easy.CommentsRobert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027With the sequester, America has adopted austerity economics. Yet austerity economics is the wrong medicine at exactly the wrong time. Look what it\u0027s done to Europe.Comments (365)Peter Alexander MeyersAuthor, professor, political theoristThe most important instrument we have for formulating and controlling everyday action -- our imagination -- has been off-loaded to screens and boxes with industrial abandon. This is the underpinning of our cinematic culture and it sustains the abuse of guns.Comments (673)Russell SimmonsFounder, GlobalGrind.comFor 42 years, we have waged war against our own people that we have disguised as the \"War on Drugs.\" Forty-two years of failure that has cost the American taxpayers $1 trillion, resulted in 45 million drug arrests, and overfilled America\u0027s prisons while failing to reduce the availability, sale, or use of drugs in the United States.Comments (690)Joseph A. PalermoAssociate professor, historian, authorCan students really be taught critical thinking, civics, and citizenship skills in a standardized format that values conformity? Will relying on MOOCs and automation in the long-term turn professors into \"delivery managers\" and students into automatons and passive consumers rather than citizens?CommentsRob BrooksEvolutionary biologist and authorCritics of this type of study love to point out that women usually decide if they will have sex with a man well before ever sighting his genitals. And, if so, then how can penis size influence choice?Comments (12)Tom Zeller Jr.Senior Writer, The Huffington PostIf TransCanada felt it had weathered the worst of a five-year battle with environmentalists and other critics of the Keystone XL pipeline project, events of the last week or so will have curbed their enthusiasm.Comments (123)William K. BlackAssoc. Professor, Univ. of Missouri, Kansas City; Sr. regulator during S\u0026L debacleHas the New York Times ever had Krugman spend two hours educating its financial reporters about austerity and the euro\u0027s design defects? That would be one of the best investments it could ever make in raising the quality of its reportage on these issues.Comments (34)Barbara GarsonAuthor, \u0027Down the Up Escalator: How the 99% Live in the Great Recession\u0027If you had to date the Great Recession, you might say it started in September 2008 when Lehman Brothers vaporized over a weekend. By 2008, however, the majority of American workers had already endured a 40-year decline in wages, security, and hope -- a Long Recession of their own.Comments (12)Mark A. AshwillAuthor, \u0027Vietnam Today: A Guide to a Nation at a Crossroads\u0027Instead of a historical whitewash, why not confront the monstrous reality that the Vietnam War, or the American War, as it\u0027s logically known in Vietnam, was unjust, unnecessary, and immoral?Comments (22)Laura ReyesSecretary-Treasurer, AFSCMEEqual Pay Day is held on a different date each year, on whatever day represents how far into the year a woman must work to earn the same pay as a man earned, on average, in the previous year.Comments (17)Keli GoffAuthor and political correspondent, TheRoot.comThe question is this: What is our responsibility as women when it comes to supporting, celebrating or critiquing trailblazing women whom we may not agree with, like or respect.Comments (384)Sen. Tom HarkinDemocratic Senator from IowaToday, we recognize the progress we have made toward pay equality -- but too many women are still underpaid for the same or nearly the same work as men do.CommentsCarolyn GregoireAssociate Lifestyle EditorIn creating a healthy lifestyle, managing stress is just as important as maintaining a nutritious diet, exercising, and getting proper rest. So kick-start a de-stressing routine that works for you this month by signing up for the challenge.CommentsEugene JareckiAward-winning dramatic and documentary filmmakerI\u0027m not naive. I know what bureaucratic thrust drives the war on drugs and what an obstacle this represents. Yet still, everywhere I look, I also see the writing on the wall. Everyday, a growing number of states moves closer to legalizing marijuana as Colorado and Washington did on Election Day.Comments (171)Joyce BandaPresident, Republic of MalawiToday I am blessed to be the president of a country filled with people who share my desire for a better Malawi and a better Africa, but we cannot do it alone. Today I stand proudly next to the Global Fund, its partners, and my fellow Africans with a promise.CommentsRobert RedfordActor, director and environmental activistTar sands expansion rewards the oil industry while putting us all at risk of oil spills and climate change. That\u0027s a raw deal by any calculation.Comments (195)Joseph A.
