{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Served as Chairman of the Financial Crisis Inquiry CommissionThe Federal Housing Finance Agency and DOJ have obtained more than $36 billion in fines from 18 major financial institutions, including banks like JP Morgan and Bank of America. However, stunningly, not one individual has been indicted or charged civilly for the conduct that resulted in these massive fines. If the banks engaged in such egregious misconduct so as to warrant tens of billions of dollars in fines, then certainly bankers were involved. DOJ must now conduct a thorough inquiry up the chain of command at each of the big banks to determine who specifically was responsible for the conduct that DOJ itself has said \"sowed the seeds of the financial meltdown.\"Kat Duff is the award-winning author of The Alchemy of Illness and The Secret Life of Sleep, which both set out to illuminate experiences often dismissed as private and off limits. In answer to my questions, she shared her insights on sleep in ancient cultures, changing attitudes toward sleep over time, and how (and especially how not) to wake someone up.This election, as we\u0027ve all heard, is dominated by angry white people. That is because the primary system is fundamentally racist. The first two presidential contests occur in states whose populations are 92 percent and 94 percent white, respectively.Author, \u0027Public Parts\u0027 and \u0027What Would Google Do?\u0027It must be difficult when you find out the super hero you idolized looks like she\u0027s just another villain that is paid by the oligarchs we\u0027re trying to defeat. It can hurt one\u0027s pride, but I\u0027m hoping my friends don\u0027t allow their fear to have a negative influence on the primaries.Stand-Up Comedianif Sanders actually does win Iowa and New Hampshire, the rest of Silver\u0027s state forecasts will change, which could result in his new model making Hillary Clinton the underdog.Des Moines nativeHillary Clinton likes to extol her foreign policy credentials, particularly her experience as secretary of state. She attaches herself to Barack Obama\u0027s coattails, pledging to continue his policies. But she is even more hawkish than the president.Professor, Thomas Jefferson School of LawFor your amusement and mine, this being an all-fun-all-the-time election campaign, let\u0027s examine the relationships between our twenty-first-century plutocrats and the contenders who have raised $5 million or more in individual contributions or through super PACs and are at 5 percent or more in composite national polls.Distinguished Senior Fellow, DemosSuspend democracy. Cut taxes for the rich. Make the poor drink toxic river water. And everybody\u0027s happy. Except those who were poisoned in the process. All 102,000 of them. In the richest country in the world.Oscar and Emmy-winning DirectorSystems of domination wage wars against our psyches and imagination, constantly presenting us with realities in which Black people are dying in the present and have no possible future. Let us dream and conjure Black queer futures without prisons, police and gender-based violence.Black femme performance artist, activist, and butterfly from Newark, New JerseyImagine what our lives would look like if for the last several decades, the snack food industry had put a portion of every bag of chips ever purchased into a fund set aside strictly to promote and preserve your personal right to crunch.Filmmaker, Brave New FoundationHow is it possible that we live in a time when progressives say #blacklivesmatter, but call the ideas of Bernie Sanders too \"radical\" to implement, and conclude his \"radical\" ideas make him unelectable?Award-winning freelance journalist, educator, and writer at www.blackandwordy.comWorking families in America often make impossible choices between food, clothing, and housing. When families struggle to afford basic necessities, they often sacrifice the things most of us take for granted.Co-chair, Congressional Progressive Caucus; U.S. Representative for Minnesota\u0027s 5th DistrictU.S. Representative, Connecticut\u0027s Third DistrictTrump frightens the Republican elite both because he is uninformed and unpredictable, but also because he is in many respects the least conservative of the conservatives. He doesn\u0027t hate government and he doesn\u0027t have much use for Wall Street and free trade. But the Trump program, to the extent that he has one, doesn\u0027t address the deeper causes of working class rage.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Today is the first Election Day of 2016 - and the stakes for the 45th president could not be higher. Go get \u0027em, right? Wrong.Chair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusWe must embrace these children after their traumatic experiences and tell them: \"You are a loved human being who\u0027s worthy in our society, who has rights to freedom and liberty, and to being valued for mind, body, and soul.\"ActressDonald Trump, a billionaire who opposes raising the minimum wage, now at the poverty level of $7.25 an hour, is holding himself out to working people as the man who will stand as a dam against that torrent.International President, United SteelworkersPoor people don\u0027t have an immediate network of others available to offer advice, or refer them to cushy on-campus jobs that will allow them a flexible work schedule, or parents that can afford to pay rent and car notes so their kids don\u0027t have to stress themselves to death.Kaelyn Thompson is a student in Texas.So Bernie Sanders doesn\u0027t kiss babies. For men like Sanders, likeability isn\u0027t a priority because it doesn\u0027t need to be.President, Barbara Lee Political Office and Barbara Lee Family FoundationThe idea that any LGBT people could support Trump while he demagogues other minorities is not just sad; it\u0027s repellant. But the Log Cabin Republicans\u0027 thinking that he\u0027d actually be \"good for the gays\" was also just plain deluded.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostFor the past decade, the Latino population in Iowa has been growing faster than the national rate, and has resulted in a larger Latino population within the Hawkeye State. As a result, the Latino community can impact an important caucus, provided they turn out and participate.National Executive Director, League of United Latin American CitizensAs a nation, we\u0027re nibbling around the edges with accountability measures and other reforms, but we\u0027re ignoring the immutable core issue: much of white and wealthy America is perfectly happy with segregated schools and inequity in funding.2016 Washington State Teacher of YearPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideWhile the folks who illegally occupied the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge claimed to want to overthrow the tyranny of the federal government, they seemed quite willing to leave the tyranny of patriarchy unquestioned.Professor of Women, Gender, \u0026 Sexuality Studies and Director of the School of Language, Culture, \u0026 Society at Oregon State UniversityI think we need to change the phrase \"breed like rabbits\" to \"breed like humans,\" as no other species on this planet even comes close to the human reproduction rate. As our population grows, available land shrinks and more and more people are forced to live in crowded, urbanized environments, a situation ripe for the easy spread and emergence of infectious agents.Neurologist, public health specialist, authorIn many ways, the health debate between Clinton and Sanders is really less about health policy than about the entire conception of their campaigns: Clinton the pragmatic incrementalist and Sanders the bold visionary. But neither of the two candidates is focused on measures, incremental or bold, that move our health care system to focus on promoting good health, demanding that health care providers get paid for quality care or reducing racial inequities in health care.Senior Fellow, Roosevelt Institute; author of \u0027Fighting for Our Health\u0027In this historic moment, many are skeptical, if not outright afraid of what is next. Remarkable innovations like AlphaGo scare enough people that there is a legitimate debate about whether the risks of artificial intelligence could outweigh the rewards.CEO, Professional Investor and Chairman, Intelligence Squared U.S. DebatesRecently we passed another sad milestone in the history of the Guantánamo prison: As of Sunday, January 31st, President Obama has kept Guantánamo open for longer than President Bush did.Here\u0027s the thing: It is entirely possible that Orlando Cicilia really is a changed man who\u0027s simply trying to make a decent, legitimate living. And maybe everything Rubio wrote about him being qualified to sell houses was true. But a real estate license is a privilege; voting is a right.Editor in Chief, AMERICAblogMost of us don\u0027t think twice about hopping in the shower or running a load of dishes in the dishwasher. But for Flint, Michigan, resident Melissa Mays, 37, these daily acts are fraught with anxiety and fearThe StirVideo Editor, ArcadegoTo my fellow parents, remember: you don\u0027t need to follow the crowd.
