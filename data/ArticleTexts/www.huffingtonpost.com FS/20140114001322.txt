{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorI\u0027m finding some of the responses by conservative politicians, economists, et al to the War on Poverty discussion to be interesting and revealing. There\u0027s a lot of silliness, and worse, of course. I\u0027d assign the Reagan quip, \"we fought a war on poverty and lost,\" to that category, as well as the misleading $20 trillion talking point. But once they get past the canned stuff, there\u0027s some interesting substance. Progressives have largely been pointing out that, in fact, rigorous analysis shows both significant and even lasting progress against poverty, amidst steep remaining challenges.CommentsRev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkWhile the investigation continues, subpoenas get issued and details hashed out, one thing has become abundantly clear: the residents of Fort Lee and the people of New Jersey were treated as some sort of an afterthought.CommentsTessa GouldDirector, HuffPost Partner StudioThe banter around native advertising, and more specifically native content publishing, reached fever pitch this year. Every man and his dog had a view on how it should be defined, measured, labeled, scaled and priced. And while the the jury may still be out on a number of these issues, one thing we do know here at HuffPost Partner Studio is bloody good native content when we see it.CommentsDennis PowersInternet technologistI am the new working poor. The \"better life\" that my parents worked so hard to make for me, that I worked so hard to improve, had come down to this decision: whether to purchase food for my belly or the medication to prevent another stroke.CommentsWait But Whywww.waitbutwhy.comBeware of what I call the \"Name Fad.\" Sure, it sounds hip now, but in 30 years, the names Natalie, Chelsea, Samantha, and Lindsay will sound how Nancy, Cheryl, Susan, and Linda do today. And in 60 years, the names Ethan, Cody, Brandon, and Matthew will be Earl, Chester, Bernard, and Melvin. These are all just Name Fads -- only difference is when they happened.Comments (18)Nancy HuehnergarthPresident, Nancy F. Huehnergarth ConsultingWhat else is Big Soda doing to quash consumer water consumption, and damage the First Lady\u0027s Drink Up campaign, that we have yet to discover?Comments (46)Michael Shtender-Auerbach and Markus E. BouillonSec. of State Kerry is certainly aware of the history and histrionics of the peace process, as well as the risks of failure, and his persistence despite seeming intransigence underscores the potentially grave consequences of walking away.Comments (13)Christine PelosiChair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusNot even the Teflon fleece can save him now: the hypocrisy of pretending to be a man of the people and using the government to hurt the people will spell the end of Chris Christie\u0027s presidential chances.Comments (37)Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Something is horribly wrong with both America\u0027s employment situation and with the way we measure it. In case you missed the news, the economy generated just 74,000 payroll jobs in December, but the unemployment rate dropped by three tenths of a percentage point, from 7.0 percent to 6.7 percent. How can that be?Comments (217)Anthony W. OrlandoLecturer in the College of Business and Economics at California State University, Los AngelesOn the 50th anniversary of the War on Poverty, many Americans are still operating under the assumption that people choose to be poor and unemployed, that they\u0027d rather be lazy than rich, that they can afford the basic necessities of life. But the numbers tell a different story.Comments (300)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and author14 hospitals in the United States are charging more than ten times their costs for treatment. Specifically, for every $100 one of these hospitals spends, the charge on the corresponding bill is nearly $1,200.Comments (25)William McNultyCo-founder, Team RubiconToday, PTSD is better understood and treated than it has ever been. Why, then, is suicide so much more prevalent in young men and women who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan when compared with the general population?CommentsCaitlyn BeckerProducer, HuffPost LiveThe more you remove yourself from your devices, the more you realize that, despite what you thought, you can successfully handle being away from them.CommentsLaura SteppPulitzer Prize-winning journalistIf shows like 16 and Pregnant motivate teens to think and talk seriously with their friends, partners and parents about sex and pregnancy, that\u0027s a good thing. Teens need -- indeed are hungry for -- deeper knowledge about sex, pregnancy and pregnancy prevention.CommentsAndrey TolokonnikovFather of Pussy Riot Band MemberAs the teachers say in kindergarten, \"Gera was an adult from the beginning.\" When your mother is in prison -- adulthood comes quickly.CommentsMarty KaplanUSC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorI did not have sex with that bridge. That was Chris Christie\u0027s Hail Mary play at his press conference last week. He looked us in the eye, he told us he\u0027d done nothing wrong and he prayed it would turn out better for him with George Washington than it did for Bill Clinton with Ms. Lewinsky.CommentsFelix Reed-TsochasJames Martin Lecturer in Complex Systems, Saïd Business School, University of OxfordIn recent years new technologies have entered virtually all aspects of our social lives. At the very least, shouldn\u0027t we expect that these new technological means improve our ability to support an increasing circle of close friends? Interestingly, the answer appears to be no.CommentsMax TegmarkMIT physicist, author of \"Our Mathematical Universe\"Exactly three years ago, on January 13, 2011, we humans were dethroned by a computer on the quiz show Jeopardy!. A year later, a computer was licensed to drive cars in Nevada after being judged safer than a human. What\u0027s next?CommentsRichard (RJ) EskowSenior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host, Take Action NewsThe Republican argument against extending unemployment insurance benefits is disingenuous, mean-spirited, and insincere. But instead of calling them out on it, loudly and repeatedly, many Democrats are likewise lamenting that \"we can\u0027t find enough money.\"Comments (53)Peter Van BurenAuthor, \u0027We Meant Well\u0027 and the upcoming \u0027Ghosts of Tom Joad, A Story of the #99Percent\u0027The debate Edward Snowden envisioned when he revealed the extent of National Security Agency (NSA) spying on Americans has taken a bad turn. It\u0027s time to face these arguments directly. So here are ten myths about NSA surveillance that need debunking.Comments (17)Leo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersWithout significant changes, TPP will just be another American factory shuttering, dream shattering trade deal. Of course, the corporations that stand to profit support the current TPP scheme, as they did the other job-destroying trade deals. And so do corporate politicians.Comments (11)Aysha Akhtar, M.D., M.P.H.Neurologist, public health specialist, authorI have tried to draw attention to the general ineffectiveness of animal experiments and how they impede our chances of finding cures. I have focused on the human side of the equation. But just who are these animals abused in experimentation?Comments (18)Rep. Steve IsraelCongressman from New York\u0027s 3rd Congressional DistrictWe have all seen reports that the governor\u0027s office in New Jersey intentionally shut down highway lanes to retaliate against a political opponent. We will not tolerate such abuses in our great State. As governor, I have reviewed our own Political Retaliation Procedures (OOG-1224/g). Please review.CommentsSoraya ChemalyFeminist, Writer, Satirist... not always in that orderThese are just this weekend\u0027s examples of men having a hard time-sharing culture. Sounds an awful lot like my 3-year-old brother, who used to chant, \"Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!!!\"CommentsTerence SmithJournalistHis death brings the Sharon legacy back into the forefront of the Israeli national consciousness and confronts the current Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, with an awkward dilemma.CommentsElana Miller, MDPsychiatrist and writer at Zen PsychiatryI\u0027ve wondered, is this real? Is this really happening? Is this just a dream? I\u0027ve wondered what you would all think of me if you knew, despite the positivity in my recent writing, that at my worst moments I\u0027ve cried because I\u0027ve been in such physical pain, that I\u0027ve cried because I\u0027ve felt sorry for myself.CommentsEarl Ofari HutchinsonAuthor and political analystEven before Bridgegate, Christie had a huge problem. It had absolutely nothing to do with Hillary Clinton or any other Democrat. It has everything to do with his own party.Comments (16)Larry CohenPresident, Communications Workers of AmericaThe TPP will affect our laws, our jobs, our food and our environment. Fast track, also known as Trade Promotion Authority, forces Congress to give up its right to amend and improve this trade deal for ordinary Americans.CommentsBill MoyersManaging Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyIn a multi-part series with famed astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, we explore a variety of topics, including the nature of an expanding, accelerating universe (and how it might end), the difference between \"dark energy\" and \"dark matter,\" and the concept of God in cosmologyCommentsMichael WinshipSenior writer, Moyers \u0026 Company on public TV. Senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.An analysis of personal financial disclosure data by the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics reveals that \"for the first time in history\" a majority of senators and representatives are millionaires.CommentsAbraham H. FoxmanNational Director, Anti-Defamation LeagueSharon moved from being a warrior to becoming a statesman. In both capacities, Sharon was thinking and acting on behalf of his beloved Israel. Sometimes this meant strength and toughness. Other times it meant creative non-military decision-making.CommentsHuffPost RadioYes, Christie\u0027s presser was a \u0027tour de force performance\u0027 but was it based on implausible deniability? Clinton (Flowers) and Obama (Wright) adeptly skated by their prez campaign woes -- will Christie? Rich and Bob also debate if the Gates book helps/hurts Obama, Clinton, Biden.CommentsBruce Ettinger, 2014.13.01Bruce Kushnick, 2014.13.01Steven Kurlander, 2014.13.01Robert Naiman, 2014.13.01Charlotte Platt, 2014.13.01David Katz, M.D., 2014.13.01Daniel Wagner, 2014.13.01Rachael Clarke, 2014.13.01Tessie Castillo, 2014.13.01Jared Bernstein, 2014.13.01Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"WALLS CLOSE IN ON CHRISTIE NEW FEDERAL INQUIRY STATE PROBE HEATS UP",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BizYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
