Just for one day -- on the King Holiday -- in recognition of my father, and as TIME magazine has said, one of our nation\u0027s Founding Fathers, let us honor the memory of one of the world\u0027s most highly regarded nonviolent proponents of peace on his holiday, with no shots fired. Instead, we ask that people engage in something positive and uplifting in service to humanity.CommentsClarence B.

I am not a mistake...,\" we are engaged in that kind of love.Comments (14)Martin LondonRetired trial lawyerThis real estate development has a dramatic history: It was first proposed in the early \u002770s, and quickly morphed into a saga involving reputed mafia figures, the former mayor of Fort Lee, two of Christie\u0027s predecessors in the U.S. attorney\u0027s office and a large cast of attorneys, including me.CommentsMichael BrennerSenior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghWe live in the age of communication.
