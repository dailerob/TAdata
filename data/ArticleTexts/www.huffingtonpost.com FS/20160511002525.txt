{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Novelist and contributing opinion writerThe first part is simple. Hillary Clinton got more votes. 3 million more popular votes, to be precise. This margin will not significantly change between now and the end of the primary season. Nor will her margin in pledged delegates, close to 300, awarded proportionally state-by-state. By the normal metrics of any primary contest, Bernie Sanders has lost. Why? This, too, is not hard to answer. In the end, he came up against a truism of electoral politics -- a following primarily composed of young people and white progressives, while substantial, does not in itself carry the party or the country. The more vexing and important question we will save for last: what should Sanders and his dedicated followers do in November and beyond.Careful studies of al-Qaeda and ISIS have shown that the United States and its allies are following their game plan with some precision. Their goal is to \"draw the West as deeply and actively as possible into the quagmire.\"Institute Professor emeritus, MIT Department of Linguistics and Philosophy; Author, \u0027Who Rules the World?\u0027The President\u0027s order to fight an unauthorized war requires conscientious military members to violate their oath to \"support and uphold the Constitution,\" which by extension requires them to disobey orders that are unconstitutional. Herein lies the crux of my brother Nathan\u0027s case.Professional musician residing in the San Francisco areaNorth Carolina isn\u0027t the only state coming up with creative and unique ways to dehumanize and discriminate against an entire segment of the population. There are a half a dozen other states who have passed or are working on passing laws that allow their citizens to \"praise Jesus\" by treating His children like \"the least of these\"... and I don\u0027t want North Carolina to get all the credit for being the best \"Christians.\"Democratic candidate for U.S. Representative of North Carolina\u0027s 2nd Congressional DistrictThe combination of limiting the amount of (unpaid) maternity leave we can take and not making accommodations for us to pump breast milk once we return to work puts new mothers in a heart-wrenching position.Pilot, Frontier AirlinesWe must come to see ourselves as much more interdependent than independent, related rather than autonomous, and re-adjust our ordering of values accordingly.Confucian scholarSupporters of the law are inventing a problem where none exists, and creating fear and hysteria in order to drum up support for their cause. And for people like North Carolina\u0027s Governor Pat McCrory to use this issue for political purposes: It is outrageous, vile and a sad testament to how low politicians will go to maintain power.President, National Action NetworkIt is painfully evident that the UN\u0027s current capacity to provide humanitarian relief, support, and assistance in the face of recent crises has proven to be inadequate. As Secretary-General, I would act decisively to mobilize sufficient resources on the part of the UN System to support affected populations around the world.Candidate for UN Secretary-GeneralObama got us moving in the right direction, but when you are fleeing a forest fire, it is not just a question of direction but also of speed. Can we get to safety before catastrophe engulfs us?President, Ploughshares Fund; Author, \u0027Nuclear Nightmares: Securing the World Before It Is Too Late\u0027I have no doubt that Uber and Lyft will be back in Austin soon, but until then, the real \"losers\" in this situation are the thousands of full-time drivers in Austin who have just been put out of work with less than 48 hours\u0027 notice.McCombs School of Business student at UT Austin and Social Media Analyst at Rooster TeethToday, yes today, the United States of America maintains the largest system of immigrant detention camps of any nation on the planet. Not North Korea, not Yemen, not the People\u0027s Republic of China, but us. The People of the United States. Have we not learned our lesson?Former Governor of Maryland and Mayor of BaltimoreOh no, I\u0027ve got it -- it\u0027s because we\u0027re just poor black kids from Detroit who don\u0027t have a future anyways. Why promise us anything when we probably won\u0027t live past 18, right?Created in 1960, the Skillman Foundation is a private philanthropy that serves children in Detroit.As a white male who served in the military as an enlisted soldier and later attended West Point, I can say, without a doubt, that nothing in this photo says \"I hate white people.\"Writer, Social Equality Advocate and Army VeteranThe proponents of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) like to describe it as a free-trade deal for the 21st century. That might be a good sales pitch, but it\u0027s not accurate. The TPP has little to with reducing trade barriers, which in most cases were already low.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027\"It probably makes you better at your job,\" a CEO of an innovative health-care company recently told me. She wasn\u0027t talking about my Midwest work ethic (I\u0027m from Missouri). The implication was that because I have OCD, I must be extremely detailed, and being that detailed has helped me succeed as editor-in-chief of Women\u0027s Health magazine.Editor-in-Chief of Women’s Health MagazineIs your craving for a steak or for a rasher of crisply fried bacon a real physiological need? Not exactly. There is one thing that many animals such as cockroaches, minks, cats and humans have in common -- and that thing is an innate craving for protein.Journalist and author of MEATHOOKEDSuggesting that transgender people have ulterior motives when all they want to do is pee serves to stigmatize transgender people and trivialize who they are. That, unfortunately, is what poses a real threat to the safety of people in our communities.Counseling psychology doctoral candidateThe first rule of the Hippocratic Oath all doctors take is, \"First, do no harm.\" Why did Theranos, Valeant and Turing assume so much risk? They focused on the short-term at the expense of their companies, their patients and the health care industry.Senior Fellow, Harvard Business SchoolAll across this country women are being turned away because hospitals are allowing religion to take precedence over medical standards of care. Today one in six U.S. hospital beds is in a facility that abides by the directives.Staff Attorney, ACLU’s Reproductive Freedom ProjectThere has been intense interest on both sides of the Pacific in the possibility of a presidential visit to Hiroshima? -- ?the first by a sitting U.S. President ?-- ?so I wanted to share some details on what the purpose of the visit is, and what the President will do.Assistant to the President and Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications and SpeechwritingCan Clinton actually break the 400 Electoral Vote barrier? This hasn\u0027t happened since 1988, but it used to be a lot more common. In the 10 elections from 1952 through 1988, the winning candidate got more than 400 votes seven times.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comThe Urban Institute and the Tax Policy Center today released analyses of the costs of Sen. Bernie Sanders\u0027 domestic policy proposals, including single-payer national health insurance. They claim that Sanders\u0027 proposals would raise the federal deficit by $18 trillion over the next decade.Co-founder, Physicians for a National Health ProgramCo-founder, Physicians for a National Health ProgramNorth Carolina Governor Pat McCrory continues to tie himself in knots trying to explain the indefensible House Bill 2, North Carolina\u0027s notorious bathroom law.Director of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel HillEating your own poo is considered a faux pas. Please stop. And playing with your own urine is only considered acceptable in certain very small circles, so probably best to cut that out, too.Freelance journalistChris Mellon has spent nearly 20 years in the federal government serving in various national security positions. For the first time, he has agreed to speak publicly about his experiences within government as they relate to UFOs.Author, New York Times bestseller, \u0027UFOs: Generals, Pilots and Government Officials Go On the Record\u0027Maybe he cares so little about learning about what the GI Bill is, because he cares so little about veterans. Most of the money he raised \"for veterans,\" when he bailed on a Republican debate, still hasn\u0027t been given to veterans\u0027 groups.Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranIn the finale of a heretofore brilliant series, we watched as our heroine stumbled off post-slap, tugging at her designer suit, her always perfect hair ever-so-mussed; eyes teary, men gone, mentor betrayed, children confused, career on the precipice, and we, like Peggy Lee, could only ponder: \"Is that all there is?\"Sass \u0026 SensibilityMake no mistake -- NATO is by far the strongest and most capable military alliance in history. But big challenges loom as a new commander takes the reins in Europe. First, he must improve NATO\u0027s cybersecurity. There are still big, gaping holes in NATO\u0027s readiness in the area of offensive cyber action.Supreme Commander of NATO (2009-2013); Dean, Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts UniversityI believed that it was important for more women to run for office to address the gender gap in Congress, where fewer than one in five representatives are women. Only by getting off the sidelines will women change the dynamic and make sure their voices are added to the mix.Her influence has helped me to believe in myself. I\u0027ve lived on my own and paid the bills with no help from anyone. I\u0027ve negotiated impressive salaries, thrived in competitive sales situations, and I\u0027ve successfully stood up for myself when I experienced gender discrimination in the workplace.Author of American Woman: The Poll Dance, Media Director for We Are WomanIt is unfortunate that we were able to book with ease in the past and a simple profile picture change seems to have caused us much trouble. The situation is tough and institutionalized racism appears to be the obvious cause.Traveler, Model, and Writer for www.Followmeaway.comGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
