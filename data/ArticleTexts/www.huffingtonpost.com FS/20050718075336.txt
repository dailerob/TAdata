{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AFP07.17.2005 Arianna HuffingtonAs I continue my European tour of the Coalition of the Willing to Blog, I’ve found that, although Americans tend to think of everything outside our shores as “over there,” in truth there are significant differences “over here” when it comes to blogging. So here I am in Porto Cervo in Sardinia, surfing Italian and French blogs while reading a Business Week article about French blogs. The French, it seems, are crazy for blogging -- which only makes sense. I mean, if you think of a blog as a means of self-expression for people who like to think a lot about things, and then tell other people about those things, and then discuss what those people think about what the blogger thinks about things, what other country would love blogging more than France? In the same way that water finds its own level, modes of communication find their own communities (mon dieu, I sound almost French!). For the French, blogging hasn’t so much been a revolution as an extension of what they\u0027ve been doing for centuries...read whole post | permalink | comments07.17.2005 Harry ShearerArianna has asked me to take the reins of the Russert Watch for a couple of weeks. This week\u0027s broadcast had two huge elephants in the studio that went unnoticed for the full hour. First: Like his guest Matt Cooper, Russert had testified to the grand jury on the Plame affair, yet at no point during the interview did the salient fact sally forth to the viewer. The pretense was uninvolved journalist interviewing involved participant: the reality was one pea in the pod interviewing a fellow pea. Cooper almost made news, but Russert saved him. RUSSERT: \"…there may have been more sources [than Rove and Libby]?\" COOPER: \"Yes.\" And there that line of questioning ends... whatever desire Tim has to get into it vanishes in the morning mist.read whole post | permalink | comments07.17.2005 Andy SternLast week I was in the UK and met the shaken but resolute bus driver from the London bus bombing, George Psaradakis. He and his family were being honored at a union event, and looking at him and his kids made you cry. By the grace of god, he somehow not only survived, but managed to assist his passengers. \"Just doing my job,\" he said. \"Always trying to keep my passengers safe.\" Seeing George and his wife and two children made you remember that life is precious, just wars have human consequences, and unjust wars are crimes that stain our planet.read whole post | permalink | comments07.17.2005 Dr. Peter BregginOn June 25, Tom Cruise did the unthinkable on TV. He got serious about our widespread use of psychiatric drugs to solve our personal distress and anguish. He said that antidepressants can only “mask the problem” and that “these drugs are very dangerous.” He called psychiatry a “pseudoscience” and suggested that there are better approaches. He was right about all of this. In fact, I’d go further. Modern biological psychiatry is a materialistic religion masquerading as a science. Modern psychiatry makes believe that psychological and spiritual problems, such as anxiety and depression, are caused by mechanical failures in the physical brain.read whole post | permalink | comments07.17.2005 Alex KeyssarLike many others, I read with interest last week\u0027s report that Morgan Stanley had offered severance pay of roughly $113 million to its now-deposed head Philip Purcell. Purcell, as was widely reported, was finally forced out of his job after driving down the firm\u0027s stock price, badly harming morale, and leading numerous other executives to quit and go elsewhere. This set me to thinking. With my ignorance of investment banking and my vast inexperience as a corporate manager, I am quite certain that, if appointed to run Morgan Stanley (or any comparable firm), I too could produce a decline in the firm\u0027s stock value. And here\u0027s the great part: I would be willing to do this for a song. $10 million. Even $5 million for a year or two….read whole post | permalink | comments07.17.2005 Richard ValerianiPresident Bush says he\u0027ll consult with actor and former Senator Fred Thompson on his Supreme Court nominee.

It is the vacuum created by the steadfast refusal of Congress to enact a federal journalist-source privilege. Although forty-nine states and the District of Columbia have recognized some version of this privilege, Congress stands mute. Its failure to act has not only produced the quagmire of the Plame affair, but has also undermined our democratic system. With a federal shield law in place, journalists will have no excuse to promise confidentiality they cannot legally deliver, and sources will have a better sense of whether their effort to inform the public will or will not land them in the drink.read whole post | permalink | comments07.16.2005 Michelle PileckiIt\u0027s been more than a week since I It\u0027s been more than a week since I pointed out how amply the major US media covered the August 2004 outing of an al-Qaeda insider that Pakistani intelligence had \"flipped\" into spying on the bad guys for our side. \"Until U.S. officials leaked the arrest of Muhammad Naeem Noor Khan to reporters, Pakistan had been using him in a sting operation to track down al-Qaeda operatives around the world,\" reported CNN at the time. The United States apologized for the leaks, which put a premature end to \"a big MI5 and police surveillance operation in Britain.\" After the bombing attacks on London\u0027s transit system last week, the blogosphere bristled with questions about whether there was any connection. Why aren\u0027t the US media pursuing this: to confirm, refute, or at least ask questions?read whole post | permalink | comments07.17.2005 Jillian Crane\"Ten more,\" my trainer said. \"Use your stomach. 10, 9, 8, 7...\" CRACK. That was my back. I was at Will Roger’s Park working out with one of the elite of Hollywood trainers. I could no longer walk. As I was lying on my couch without ice to put on my back or pain killers to dull the pain, I heard a knock at the door. It was my very good girl friend, recently diagnosed with cancer. She slowly rubbed my back while she waited for the guy she had recently started dating to come over. He was going to give her a ride to a Kabbalist psychic--it was a full moon and the psychic wanted my friend to be at her house by eleven o’clock to drink a special brew that would help heal her...read whole post | permalink | comments07.16.2005 Jay RosenThe brutalizing of Scott McClellan at the White House podium on Monday is a development with long roots. They stretch well beyond the particulars of what McClellan earlier said about Karl Rove and the use of Valerie Plame to discredit Joseph Wilson. Frustrations roared to life that day from hundreds of briefings prior. Press rollback, the policy for which McClellan signed on, means not feeding but starving the beast, downgrading journalism where possible, and reducing its effectiveness as an interlocutor with the president. The president and his advisors have declared invalid the \"fourth estate\" and watchdog press model. They have moved on, and take it for granted that adversaries will not be as bold.read whole post | permalink | comments07.16.2005 Paul FeigYou remember the game of Clue, right? Well, instead of the board being a representation of a mansion, pretend the board is instead a map of Washington, DC. Using your love of intrigue and deduction, try to figure out who the second source for the Valerie Plame leak is. C\u0027mon, it\u0027ll be fun. It\u0027s the weekend. You\u0027re allowed to play games. After you mow the lawn, that is. And the garage could use a little paint, too. But just do your chores and then settle in for a little diversion.read whole post | permalink | comments07.16.2005 Earl Ofari HutchinsonLAPD violence against blacks and Latinos has continually gotten the department into hot water, and tagged it as America’s poster police agency for abuse.
