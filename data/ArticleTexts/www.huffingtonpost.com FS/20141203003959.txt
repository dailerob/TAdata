{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027If we can\u0027t take steps to increase the demand for labor, we can go the other way and try to reduce the supply. Specifically, we can try to increase the number of people employed by reducing the average number of hours worked. That should not sound far out. This is exactly the route taken by Germany, a country often held up as one of the few economic success stories in the world today. Contrary to what is often claimed, Germany has not had booming growth. In fact, its growth since the beginning of the recession has been somewhat slower than growth in the United States. Nonetheless, its unemployment rate is 5.0 percent. And unlike the United States, its low unemployment rate is not due to people leaving the labor force. There is an alternative.The racist backlash to Star Wars was especially resonant in the wake of the grand jury decision not to indict Darren Wilson in the shooting death of Michael Brown.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027Maybe death, pleasure, security, and risk are the products of this region. The risk: One day driving down the Strip about a decade ago, I realized that every hotel tower, every fountain, and every chandelier was largely paid for by losing bets. I understood for the first time what gambling really means.Author, \u0027Men Explain Things to Me\u0027If local police are going to receive military weapons at all, the federal government has an obligation to put some reasonable constraints on how they are able to use them.Senior counsel, Center for Justice, ACLUIt\u0027s a sign of how far right the Republican Party has moved that John Boehner is the standard bearer for moderate Republicans. But there\u0027s a new meaning to the word \"moderate\" that illuminates the new political reality for the GOP and for the country.Senior Fellow, DemosWhen women stand up and defend themselves, it works. Remember -- in 1975, 98% of women were mutilated just like I was. Today, it is 27%. That\u0027s 27% too many, but it\u0027s also the sign of a revolution. It wasn\u0027t handed down on high.Building to One Billion Rising REVOLUTIONThe World Health Organization reported a global total of more than 16,000 cases and nearly 6,943 deaths. We also expect economic losses in the billions of dollars in the West Africa region, as employees stay home, markets close, and food prices rise. At the same time, we are seeing some hopeful signs.President, World Bank GroupOne year ago, a sexual assault survivor in the U.S. military faced a daunting landscape. The president gave military leaders one year to implement the defense bill and show significant progress. And so this week, those military leaders will give their report to the president.U.S. Senator from MissouriSexual harassment often starts at an early age and there are intervention strategies that can sometimes help redirect and rehabilitate the young man. One should not assume that the person committing the harassment is beyond redemption, especially if they are young.Technology journalistThe reality is that we are no longer preparing our children to work in factories; we are readying them for today\u0027s knowledge-based economy. This requires mastery of a wide assortment of technical skills, ability to work in groups, and continual learning.Academic, Researcher, Writer, EntrepreneurChange is undeniably hard. Progress is not an exercise in expediency. But if you are committed, then you will understand that you have no choice but to keep going not to see if you will win, but until you win.President, National Action NetworkCops have really hard jobs. That doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s off limits ever to question the manner in which some of them fulfill their responsibilities or to raise serious concerns about the institutional racism that undeniably pervades our culture and inevitably affects how policing is carried out.Director of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel HillThere are so many crises that when we turn our attention to working to bring one of these under control - or trying to reduce the suffering that a particular crisis is causing - two more pop up. At a different time in our history, we may have felt tempted to ignore some of these threats.U.S. Ambassador to the United NationsEnriching the informational base of democracy and making greater use of interactive public reasoning can contribute significantly to making democracy more workable, and also allow reasoned assessment of social welfare.Nobel Laureate Economic SciencesOn this Giving Tuesday, where charity is a priority for all of us who have shelter, health and peace, we all must act on behalf of the 51 million.ActorEducation -- the backbone of these countries\u0027 futures -- is not immune to Ebola\u0027s insidious reach.Actress and Concern Worldwide Global AmbassadorIn most industries, the surest way to create major and lasting value is not through market share, but by expanding or creating new markets. That\u0027s what women are doing to the stats by starting their own businesses.Director on the boards of Berkshire Hathaway, Costco Wholesale, and Intel Corporation; Trustee on the board of Save the Children; Advisor to Hampton CreekBoth powers would benefit if the United States abandoned its current tendency to consider most every Chinese move to be a form of aggression, and if China abandoned its tendency to consider most American moves as an attempt to constrain and restrain, if not humiliate, a growing China.Professor of international relations, George Washington UniversityRepublicans should be more concerned about the failure of GOP leadership to address this issue. Not only did Boehner miss out on an opportunity to mend fences with a growing Hispanic voting bloc, he has now backed himself into a corner with no clear way out.Political blogger, Detroit NewsEbola scares. Antivaccination fads. Rampant obesity. Never has the U.S. been in more urgent need of a Surgeon General. The current nominee, Dr. Murthy, is an outstanding candidate who should have been approved and in place months ago to deal with these urgent challenges. Unfortunately, Congress refuses to take action.Author, \u0027The Color of Atmosphere: One Doctor\u0027s Journey In and Out of Medicine\u0027We are beginning to see glimmers of hope that this deadly virus can be stopped, but much work remains to be done. It is time now for Americans, as individuals, to step up and show their compassion for the people of West Africa.Actor and director, currently stars in ScandalEveryone wants to know the secret to a flawless face.

They were wrong. Five years later, their promises stand in stark contrast to the world we live in today.Political activist and writerThe long-term deterioration of the middle class, accelerated by the Wall Street crash of 2008, has not been pretty. Today, we have more wealth and income inequality than any major country on earth.Independent U.S. Senator from VermontToday, the Washington Post ran a \"Fact Checker\" story on CAP\u0027s estimate and gave it two Pinocchios. We believe their conclusions were incorrect by missing the forest for the trees.Vice President for Immigration Policy, Center for American ProgressOpposition to Obama\u0027s Net Neutrality statement has come from unlikely bedfellows ranging from Sen. Ted Cruz to Rev. Jesse Jackson. With so much nonsense, the editors of our most established newspapers have stepped into the fray to set the record straight. Well, not exactly.Senior Director of Strategy, Free PressScientists wanted to see if children\u0027s experiences with their parents shape their nervous system responses much later on, when they are in romantic relationships.
