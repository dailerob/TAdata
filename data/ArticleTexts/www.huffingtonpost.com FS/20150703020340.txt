{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorToday\u0027s jobs report was a bit weaker than expected, and a bit weaker than it looked at first blush. While payrolls were up 223,000 in June, in line with expectations, and the unemployment rate fell to a record low in this recovery of 5.3 percent, there were several mitigating factors. Hourly wage growth was flat in June, a slight deceleration from last month\u0027s report, while the labor force participation rate ticked down a significant 0.3 percentage points to 62.6 percent, its lowest level since the late 1970s. As the job market has gradually tightened, I\u0027ve expected to see some upward movement in the participation rate. The fact that this has yet to occur suggests that there is much more slack than the 5.3 percent unemployment rate suggests.I don\u0027t want to spend my time chastising you. I\u0027ll leave that to your business partners who have the power to scold you where it hurts. Instead, I\u0027m writing to say thank you! What you did with your straight talk was send more Latino voters to the polls than several registration rallies combined!Award-Winning ActressFor all its genuine achievements, the sad reality is that the once-proud edifice of the European Union has turned into a wobbling house of cards. What has gone wrong? Let me suggest a few of the most obvious weaknesses.Christian Author and SpeakerFalcon 9 is the third resupply mission of its kind to fail in recent months. Is it more than a failure, but also a metaphor of our times? Ambitions that, even in their smallness, can\u0027t be realized?Founding Editor, Duke MagazineGiven the economy\u0027s size and complexity, our problems cannot be solved by tinkering around the edges. Instead, a total revamp is necessary, one that both grows the middle class while reining in the runaway excess of the business class.General President, International Brotherhood of TeamstersHow much worse is it going to have to get before we take accountability for our racism and actively engage in dismantling it?Race Educator, Problem Solver1400 years ago, the Prophet Muhammad prophesized that a time would come when nothing would remain of Islam but its name, nothing of the Quran but its word, and that many \"Mosques would be splendidly furnished but destitute of guidance\" (Mishkatul Masabih).Physician, writer and human rights advocateThe NYPL, like many other libraries around the country, has already begun to seize the day in an effort to answer the needs and wants of its community.Author, \u0027Dreaming in Chinese\u0027Military power is by definition destructive, but in the past such force often cleared the ground for the building of local, regional, or even global structures, however grim or oppressive they might have been. If force always was meant to break things, it sometimes achieved other ends as well. Now, it seems as if breaking is all it can do.Editor, TomDispatch.comLiberation movements want a place at the table. The Islamic State, on the other hand, wants to destroy the table. The Islamic State isn\u0027t simply an insurgency. Though it certainly aspires to overthrow the current regimes in Damascus and Baghdad, it doesn\u0027t have any particular attachment to this territory. It maintains a warm spot in its cold heart for the holy sites in Saudi Arabia. Otherwise, it doesn\u0027t care about national boundaries.Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogHere\u0027s the real message behind the congressional votes on fast-track authority and trade-adjustment assistance: Democrats will no longer support major trade agreements that cost American jobs and create further downward pressure on wages, especially as inequality continues to accelerate.U.S. Representative, Connecticut\u0027s Third DistrictAs the 2016 presidential campaign kicks off, the economy is growing and Americans are getting back to work. However, for far too many people plotting a course from the working class to the middle class requires navigating dangerous waters filled with financial icebergs.President, Center for Responsible LendingOvertime pay has become such a rarity that many Americans don\u0027t even realize that the majority of salaried workers were once eligible for it. We just keep working longer and harder, for less. Meanwhile, corporate profits have doubled over the last three decades.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Anyone who aspires to our nation\u0027s highest office should have spoken up strongly against Trump\u0027s remarks immediately, without hesitation. It shouldn\u0027t be a surprise, though, that the major Republican presidential candidates did not. They didn\u0027t want to ruffle the feathers of their party\u0027s anti-immigrant base.Political Director, People For the American WaySocial Security is as American as fireworks on the Fourth of July. This summer marks the eightieth anniversary of its enactment. To celebrate the birthday, let\u0027s do what past generations have done.Founding Co-director, Social Security WorksWe don\u0027t have to ignore the biology of addiction to appreciate its psychology and to approach those who suffer humanistically rather than moralistically.Developmental neuroscientist and professor of developmental psychologyWe must never forget the genocide in Srebrenica. We must always honor its victims, its survivors. But we must never forget also that our words will ring hollow if, in the here and now, we don\u0027t believe the unbelievable, if we don\u0027t end the culture of impunity that exists in so many places around the world, and if we don\u0027t strengthen our resolve to protect those who count on us all.U.S. Permanent Representative to the United NationsDoing away with official reverence for the Confederate battle flag is largely a symbolic move that doesn\u0027t come close to addressing the problems surrounding race in America, including disparities in treatment by the criminal justice system and the resurgence of voter suppression laws and other schemes designed to rig the elections in favor of powerful conservative interests.President, People For the American WayI was raised to be a strong, black woman who could handle her own emotions -- not ask someone to help me sort them out. How dare I need treatment for feeling worthless and for being bullied when I come from a lineage of ancestors who used strength and endurance as a way to survive?Social Worker, Founder of Respect Your StruggleCatholic Vote has created a video, \"Not Alone,\" in opposition to last week\u0027s Supreme Court ruling granting same-sex couples the right to marry. On their website, they tell us that the video is about \"6 courageous young people\" who want to \"tell the world\" that they are not afraid to express their views against same-sex marriage. This video is offensive. Here\u0027s why.Professor of Theater, Ursinus CollegeFocus on what is good in the U.S. too often slips into chauvinist nationalism. So we need to reframe the celebrations this July 3-5 weekend as Inter-Dependence Day, avoiding all the implications of thinking that somehow it is possible to be independent of the global economy, culture or environment.Fair warning, if you use the terms, \"Fire and Brimstone,\" \"God\u0027s Wrath,\" \"Sodom and Gommorah\" or \"Damnation\"... this is not the questionnaire for you.Playwright, ActorIf you\u0027re waiting for your next big vacation to truly de-stress, you may be putting yourself at risk for burnout. Here in the U.S., we don\u0027t even guarantee paid time off for all, making us the only advanced country leaving our workers with zero time to regroup.Behavioral Therapist and Author of Reset: Make the Most of Your StressIf someone ever tells you that it\u0027s just meta data, remind him or her of how the British could have used meta data to find Paul Revere and show them this network visualization.Senior Editor for Technology and Society, The Huffington PostSomething unexpected has happened along the way -- more and more participants have expressed the sentiment that what we really need is a new declaration of independence.ChristopherPhillips.com, Author, Socratic sojourner, Network Ethics Fellow @ Harvard, Rabble rouser 4 true democracy, happy Hubby \u0026 Daddy, aspiring enlightened generalistI breathed a huge sigh of relief as the Supreme Court rejected an attempt to undermine the housing law that was passed in Dr. King\u0027s memory. Yet it was hard to forget that last week also marked two years since the Court eviscerated the voting rights protections that activists like Dr. King and my father had given so much of their lives to achieve.Member of People For the American Way\u0027s African American Ministers In Action, former pastor of St. Luke United Methodist ChurchWordsmith, photo nerd, sitcom junkie, dog lover, and Editor at 500px. Everything I ever needed to know I learned from Calvin and Hobbes.Professional photographerWhen the EEOC began recognizing that discrimination against trans persons was a form of sex discrimination, the community was nearly completely silent. When cases began being won, the silence continued; the issue was avoided when it wasn\u0027t being misrepresented.Executive Director, Gender Rights MarylandMissing out on sleep won\u0027t just leave you groggy the next day. Over time, sleep deprivation can start to mess with nearly every system in your body, which can put your health and well-being at risk.Entrepreneur, CEO at One Mall GroupIt may be tough to handle, but there are ways of dealing with anxiety. Breathing exercises, getting all of your beauty rest, and staying away from the coffee are all great ways to feel better, but if all else fails, maybe you should eat a pickle.
