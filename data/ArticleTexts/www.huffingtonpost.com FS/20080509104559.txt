{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOAppearing on the O\u0027Reilly Factor yesterday, John McCain grabbed a shovel and dug himself deeper with yet another denial of having said he didn\u0027t vote for Bush, insisting: \"I voted for Bush in 2000 and 2004.\" But on the way to that unequivocal refutation, his unconscious mind jumped up, started waving its hands and yelled: \"Not so fast!\" O\u0027REILLY: Did you vote for President Bush? McCAIN: Of course not. I campaigned all over this country for him. As dear old Dr. Freud would tell you, the unconscious is a powerful thing. And the new, do-and-say-anything- to-be-president McCain clearly couldn\u0027t keep the old, give-it-to-you-straight McCain -- and the truth -- from slipping out.Read Post | CommentsBIOAdam Blickstein, 05.09.2008Name one other policy area besides Iraq that solely uses endless time, endless patience and endless resources as an acceptable rubric for successfully implementing policy.Read Post | CommentsBIOJohn Ridley, 05.09.2008It has become an obsession, and as with any obsession it is unhealthy. The conclusions drawn from these excavations usually reflect the media\u0027s own bias.Read Post | CommentsBIORobert F. Kennedy Jr. and Brendan DeMelle, 05.09.2008Hundreds of ducks made a fatal landing in oil and toxic sludge; Republicans block federal aid to wind and solar; the shocking testimony of three whistleblowers on US contractors in Iraq.Read Post | CommentsBIOHarry Shearer, 05.08.2008Maybe we\u0027re not surprised anymore when hidden motives paraded before us are ignored by the corporate media. Have we also moved beyond public radio being held to a higher standard?Read Post | Comments (95)BIOMax and the Marginalized, 05.09.2008McCain doesn\u0027t remember who he was in 2000, so why should he remember what he said either? Anytime John McCain opens his mouth, it\u0027s worth considering the source.Read Post | CommentsBIOLorelei Kelly, 05.09.2008My congratulations to everyone involved in this movie -- you pulled off a more subtle treatment of hugely complex issues than what often passes for a Congressional hearing.Read Post | CommentsBIOAmy Ephron, 05.08.2008Cindy McCain won\u0027t release her tax returns. I could say a lot of things about this, like the sheer arrogance of it and implication that the first lady doesn\u0027t have a public responsibility.Read Post | Comments (27)BIOArt Levine, 05.08.2008Apparently white people hold a grudge: ever since Democrats pushed for African-American voting rights and integration, most whites haven\u0027t voted for a Democratic president for over 40 years.Read Post | Comments (470)BIOKathleen Reardon, 05.09.2008We have some mutual persuading to do. Forcing Clinton to drop out isn\u0027t the answer. It will leave extensive, irreparable damage, and the press will have a field day with that.Read Post | CommentsBIOAndy Borowitz, 05.09.2008Sources close to the former president said that Mr. Clinton had been mulling such a defection as early as the night of the Iowa primary, but that he only decided to make his decision public today.Read Post | Comments (18)BIOHuff TV, 05.09.2008Read Post | CommentsBIOJohn Cusack, 05.08.2008That was fun -- just got done spending $3 trillion.
