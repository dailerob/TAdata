{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupMitch McConnell has done his share of bipartisan deals in the Senate, but almost always on his own terms and almost always after he helped create the crisis that he then takes credit for ending. Now he must keep the peace among potential Republican presidential candidates in the Senate, pacify the tea party wing while showing that the GOP is “ready to govern,” deal with the hapless Republican leadership in the House, and even reach out to President Barack Obama, who has reason to be wary. McConnell has the skill to bridge divides within the GOP in the Senate, and maybe in Congress as a whole. That will be his first challenge. Whether he can speak to the whole country and try to bring Americans together -- and whether he wants to -- will become clear in the months ahead.In the lame duck and for the next two years, if Republicans behave as if the outcome of this election was a mandate for their radical policies, they will find themselves in deep trouble.Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersSciencey Sun Venerator + Political CartoonsThe polling place I usually go to -- the local Sherriff\u0027s office just down the street -- was closed down this year. So I ventured out to the alternative this time, the local Grocery store, and stood in line. It was boring. It was maddeningly inefficient. It was cold (we extended the line down the frozen food isle) and it was educational.Director, Education \u0026 Development for Constant Contact, Inc.While gaining control of Congress sounds good to the Republicans on paper, I suspect that 24 months from now, when the presidential election is upon us, they\u0027ll be regretting having taken the helm on foreign policy.CEO of Country Risk Solutions and COO of RiskSoukWe\u0027ve launched a dedicated section on The Huffington Post, ReWork: Rethinking Work and Well-being. Here you\u0027ll find success stories, news about what\u0027s working, innovative programs, case studies and the latest data about the many positive business effects of well-being and sustainable work practices.Political cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideSo many conversations are initiated and shaped by women on Twitter. Important conversations about terms that used to fly right by me in their ideological camouflage: Rape culture. Misogyny. Privilege, gender bias, slut-shaming.Writer, comedian, and author, \u0027Funny On Purpose\u0027When politics has gone bankrupt and finds its extension in fratricidal war, there is only one way forward, which is to make everyone understand that no one can win alone and that salvation, and suicide alike, can only be collective.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.Numerous fairy tales, and the legends behind them, are actually watered-down versions of uncomfortable historical events. These darker stories might be too terrifying for today\u0027s little lambkins, as well as some adults!AuthorCalifornia voters have approved Proposition 1 -- the 2014 California Water Bond. The ultimate value and effectiveness of the bond will depend on how it is implemented and how the funds are spent. Here are some key issues to watch, things to understand about the new water bond, and recommendations:President, Pacific InstituteSome liken the Republican victory to a giant wave. However, when compared to historical elections involving the houses of congress, this win is more like spilling a glass of water. The following elections are the worst defeats of either Democrats or Republicans in the last 100 years.Writer. Editor for the Literati QuarterlyAt 47, with several projects on the horizon, the last thing one hopes for is a visit from Parkinson and for him to overstay his welcome.PeriodistaHating Obama should not be an effective political organizing strategy, but is indeed in the absence of any effective Democratic backbone to counter right-wing absurdities. Democrats deserve their losses; they ceded the battle before it began.Scientist and former White House Senior Policy Analyst; Ph.D. in marine biology/neurophysiologySomething has to give. We have a serious health crisis in America and it\u0027s impacting a whole lot more people than the Ebola virus.Author, Producer, AdvocateProducer and AuthorEven if you believe government has no role banning large sodas or taxing sugar, do yourself a favor -- cut sugary drinks out of your diet. It could be the difference that saves your life.CEO and President of Mount Sinai Health SystemClinical director of the Mount Sinai Diabetes CenterMindfulness is not complicated. It\u0027s something we can all do: notice things. By just standing back and being aware, you immediately gain a new view of your inner and outer world along with internal changes in the brain.Popular comedian and bestselling author of \u0027Sane New World\u0027Apple became the world\u0027s most valuable company for a number of complex reasons, including the design genius of its brilliant founder. But when you look under the surface, it is more open than you might think.Advisor to government and business leaders; Author, \u0027Macrowikinomics\u0027Meet Steven Rose, aka Detoxx Bustiáe, an Old Navy sales associate by day, performance drag queen by night.International photographer, photojournalist and artistSometimes it seemed that only two issues mattered in the midterm election campaigns just ended -- two issues on the lips of politicians nationwide, at the top of the news 24/7, and constantly trending on social media: ISIS and Ebola. Think of them as the two horsemen of the present American apocalypse.Editor, TomDispatch.comAt the same time humanitarian organizations are being encouraged to rapidly scale-up efforts to contain the deadliest Ebola outbreak in history, increased political rhetoric on travel restrictions threatens to create new barriers to the NGO community\u0027s response to this crisis.President, InterActionKnowing what to say and how to act in your campaign\u0027s lowest moment can be the spark that helps you kick-start your next successful run for office. It\u0027s an audition for the role you didn\u0027t know you were up for. In short, people are watching. Make it good.Professor of political management and director of the Graduate School of Political Management, George Washington UniversityIf the Republican Party takes full control of the U.S. Congress in the midterm election, policy gridlock is likely to worsen, risking a rerun of the damaging fiscal battles that led last year to a government shutdown and almost to a technical debt default. More broadly, the gridlock will prevent the passage of important structural reforms that the U.S. needs to boost growth.Chairman of Roubini Global Economics, Professor of Economics at the Stern School of BusinessVoters are facing an ugly surprise on their way to the voting booth on Tuesday. What most people don\u0027t realize is that since 2006, some 34 state legislatures have worked diligently to chip away at the fundamental right to vote -- and overwhelmingly, people of color are the target.Director, ACLU Washington Legislative OfficeIf you\u0027ve ever wondered what Lizzie and Jane\u0027s lives would have been like if their overbearing mother could reach them 24/7 to discuss their dwindling marriage prospects, look no further than Ortberg\u0027s wonderfully playful book. The only thing missing? Bridal emojis.Co-creator of The ToastSo far there haven\u0027t been very many progressives willing to stick their head out there and say they\u0027re willing to take on Team Hillary. I understand that the Washington media is saying that she can\u0027t be beat. That\u0027s hilarious. Isn\u0027t that exactly what they said in 2008?Host, \u0027The Young Turks\u0027Here are ten unusual words that sum up the writing experience, and our attitudes to writing, in one way or another.Author; Lecturer in English, Loughborough Univ.One need not look far and wide to discern Netanyahu\u0027s disingenuousness and misguided policies that have only undermined Israel\u0027s future security. He uses his political skills to deceive and mislead in order to \"protect himself from political defeat\" while disregarding what is best for the future of the state.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUYou would think that TV stations have a public-interest obligation to cover government, public affairs, important issues -- stories citizens need to know. After all, stations owners pay nothing for the licenses the public gives them to broadcast over the airwaves the public owns. But if you believe that, you\u0027d be wrong.USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorIt would be comforting to think that life and death decisions are made more deliberately than traffic navigation, but this is not the case. Indeed, they are often at least as rushed and impulsive, with emotions running overwhelmingly high.Psychotherapist; Executive/life coachThe next time the Pentagon congratulates itself on another \"good year\" for arms transfers, Congress, the public, and the press should take a closer look at how those arms are being used. Being the world\u0027s leading arms trading nation is nothing to brag about.Director, Arms and Security Project, Center for International PolicyGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
