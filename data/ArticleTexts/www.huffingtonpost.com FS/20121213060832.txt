{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"To hear the media tell it, all eyes are on the fiscal cliff. What will the deal ultimately be? And, most important, which side will win and which side will lose? Actually, only Washington and the media are transfixed. The rest of the nation is absorbed with trying to make it in the struggling economy -- the same economy that will still be struggling after the champagne corks are popped as soon as the fiscal deal, whatever it may be, is announced in a few weeks. So why are none of our political leaders looking beyond the cliff, planning for what happens next? Far from having a debate about how to grow the economy, all we\u0027re currently talking about is how to preserve the status quo -- which, for millions, is an utter disaster. Getting our economy moving will require a larger, bolder and more forward-looking conversation than the one we\u0027re currently locked into.Read Post | Comments (100)Robert Reich, 12/12/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027By linking interest rates directly to the rate of unemployment, Bernanke is acknowledging that the Federal Reserve Board has two mandates: not just price but also employment. But the sad fact is near-zero interest rates won\u0027t do much for jobs because banks aren\u0027t allowing many people to take advantage of them.Read Post | Comments (22)Sue Talley, EdD, 12.12.2012Dean, School of TechnologyIn the U.S., we have the people, the talent, and the technology to meet the cyber security threat head on. Now we need the will to recognize the size of the challenge--and leaders willing to transition our current military spending to this new way of preparing those who will defend us.Read Post | CommentsCecile Richards, 12/12/12President of Planned Parenthood Federation of America and Planned Parenthood Action FundAn alarming set of bills is about to move to Michigan Governor Rick Snyder\u0027s desk as soon as today. Pushed through by lame-duck legislators who are about to leave office, these bills would make Michigan one of the most regressive states in the nation on women\u0027s health.Read Post | Comments (377)Mohamed A. El-Erian, 12/12/12CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOAnalysts will be hard pressed to explain how equity markets ended unchanged on the day of an unprecedented policy announcement from the Fed. An answer can be found by considering the competing emotions a patient feels when confronted with a new drug that has yet to go through clinical testing.Read Post | CommentsWilliam T. Talman, MD, 12/07/12Professor of Neurology and Neuroscience, University of IowaI suspect that most people don\u0027t realize how much they owe their well-being, even their lives, to research using experimental animals. Do animals used in research deserve protection? Yes, and they get it.Read Post | Comments (259)Bill Gates and Melinda Gates, 12/12/12This holiday season, we decided to list several of the charity initiatives that have sparked our interest. Each of these projects takes a different approach, but they have three things in common: they\u0027re innovative, committed to transparency and accountability, and they\u0027re getting good results.Read Post | Comments (28)Rev. Al Sharpton, 12/12/12President, National Action NetworkWhether it\u0027s a statutory initiative, a veto referendum or an outright recall election, we must take action in Michigan and anywhere workers\u0027 rights are under threat. There has been far too much sacrifice to secure our ability to collectively bargain and create fairer working conditions for us to give up now.Read Post | Comments (732)Diana Butler Bass, 12/11/12Author, \"Christianity After Religion: The End of Church and the Birth of a New Spiritual Awakening\"Ancient Christian saints, theologians and evangelists would be horrified that those who claim to stand for tradition have forgotten the most important aspect of it.

The \"chained CPI\" concept can be explained in one sentence: It calculates cost-of-living increases much more slowly than before, by subtracting the cost of the things you can\u0027t afford to buy anymore.Read Post | CommentsJimmy Baron, 12/12/12Former Radio DJWhy have pranks always been such a big part of morning radio? Because people like them. Research and ratings both show it, undeniably.

While one explorer came looking for India, the other took India to the world.

During the Institutional Revolutionary Party rule, Mario Vargas Llosa called Mexico the \"perfect dictatorship\" because it had the trappings of democracy, but was ruled harshly by one party.

Pretend that when they are yelling at the president they are actually yelling at you. Imagine that each insult is very personally directed at your stupid face. Try not to cry. When the eight hours are up, imagine that this is every day of your life and ask yourself if you still want to be a chef.Read Post | Comments (29)Bruce Ackerman and Yair Listokin, 12/12/12As Keynes emphasized, \"The boom, not the slump, is the right time for austerity.\" Following this maxim, the grand bargain should contain special belt-tightening provisions that raise taxes above Clinton era rates if unemployment falls significantly below the 6 percent mark.Read Post | Comments (40)Seth Shostak, 12/12/12Senior Astronomer, SETI InstituteFor the last hundred years, science has become a boutique activity, performed by high priests assumed to possess superior intellects and inferior social skills.
