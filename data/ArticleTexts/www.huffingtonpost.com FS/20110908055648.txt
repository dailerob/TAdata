{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Two years ago, I asked Arthur Delaney, one of our gifted young reporters at The Huffington Post, to focus his coverage on one thing: putting flesh and blood on the data of our economic crisis, and bringing to our readers the real stories of the unemployed, of those facing foreclosure, of the \"formerly middle class.\" Arthur embraced his mission with a powerful combination of passion, empathy, and a healthy dose of anger. His poignant reporting has now been collected in A People\u0027s History of the Great Recession, an e-book that is being published today, in the shadow of Labor Day, and in the wake of the worst jobs report in 11 months. I hope that it will help bring a much-needed sense of urgency to the public debate and our leaders\u0027 priorities.

She\u0027s either shut off or exhausted her sensitivity in order to serve and survive. She\u0027s put her life on hold and has seen so much that the rest of us can\u0027t even imagine.
