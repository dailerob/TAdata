{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Nora Ephron is gone -- and I can\u0027t believe it. Whenever I was around her through the years the air crackled with energy and ideas and one-liners -- and a sense of celebration. That\u0027s what makes yesterday\u0027s news so hard to take in. Nora was an integral part of the HuffPost family -- an investor, a supporter, and a constant sounding board months before we launched. Since then, she\u0027s been a contributing editor who more than lived up to her name -- regularly offering up notes, suggestions, and terrific ideas (our very popular Divorce section was one of them). Professionally, her legacy will be that of an exceptionally gifted and versatile artist who could do it all, and do it all incredibly well. Personally, she\u0027ll be cherished as a wife and mother, and a devoted, giving, treasured -- and irreplaceable -- friend. Indeed, she was as talented at friendship as she was at everything else she tried.Read Post | Comments (124)Rita Wilson, 06/27/12Editor at Large, Huff/Post50; Actor, Producer, SingerNora celebrated life to an insatiable degree, yet without any of the manic energy one associates with people who have \"insatiable appetites\" for life.

I won\u0027t get near the first two right now, but I\u0027ll hazard a guess on what the Court is likely to decide tomorrow: It will uphold the constitutionality of Obamacare by a vote of 6 to 3.Read Post | Comments (408)Marlo Thomas, 06/27/12Award-winning actress, author, and activistFor Nora Ephron, life was something to celebrate. And explore. And bitch about. And then celebrate again. You didn\u0027t have to read all of her brilliant essays to immediately see that the woman had a titanium-strength point of view --and she was achingly funny about it.Read Post | CommentsAmy Corbett Storch, 06/26/12Blogger, Amalah.comThey really are different than girls.
