{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"APAPopensecrets.orgSee all posts »BIOWe learned this week that, even though White House counsel Fred Fielding had advised him that the Libby jury had reached a reasonable verdict, the president decided to commute Libby\u0027s sentence because if he didn\u0027t \"it would have caused a fracture with the vice president.\" So Scooter got off because George Bush was afraid to piss off Dick Cheney. Is the same dynamic driving the president on Iraq? Are the efforts of administration pragmatists like Robert Gates and Condi Rice to shift the White House on the war being thwarted by 43\u0027s reluctance to face the wrath of his venomous veep? There\u0027s a scary thought: Americans continue to die in Iraq not because Bush is worried withdrawal would embolden al-Qaeda over there but because it would infuriate al-Cheney here at home.Read Post | Comments (83)BIOChris Kelly, 07.10.2007Real patriots -- like the thin yellow line of heroes at the National Review Online -- have just about had it with the \"mothers\" of the \"soldiers\" in actual \"combat.\"Read Post | Comments (245)BIOMarty Kaplan, 07.11.2007In Bush\u0027s faith-based epistemology, the strongest possible justification for any action he takes is that he believes in it.
