Type, for example, \"public diplomacy\" when you\u0027re on Twitter, and you\u0027ll get the latest on what twitterers are saying about the subject. But what\u0027s happening is not necessarily what\u0027s important.Read Post | CommentsMitchell Bard, 07.16.2010Writer and FilmmakerRepublican policies precipitated the recession, and the party\u0027s solutions are to offer more of the same.
