{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, we lost Joan Rivers, who died on Thursday, at 81-years-young (as Sarah Silverman tweeted: \"She wasn\u0027t done.\"). Rivers was a true trailblazer. Known now for the red carpet, she began with the glass ceiling, shattering it by telling-- and sometimes shouting -- unspoken truths. \"A girl, you\u0027re 30-years-old, you\u0027re not married -- you\u0027re an old maid,\" she said, satirizing the prevalent culture. \"A man, he\u0027s 90-years-old, he\u0027s not married -- he\u0027s a catch!\" That was 1967 on the Ed Sullivan Show. \"My act spoke to women who weren\u0027t able to talk about things,\" she said. \"I was talking about things that were really true.\" And she never stopped. Through all her iterations, struggles, ups and downs, there was never anything fake about her -- except for her plastic-surgery-altered face, which, of course, she gleefully lampooned. Asked what she wanted on her tombstone, she replied: \"She had a great time.\" As did we.Time is running out. The more we delay, the more we will pay. Climate change is accelerating and human activities are the principal cause.Secretary-General, United NationsThank you on behalf of all comedians working today who know that you always fought the enemies of comedy. You controlled the room always, in the most professional way. You leveled the playing ground for all comedians. You\u0027ll be missed, but not forgotten. Copied but never matched. Never bested.Presidential Candidate, Peace and Freedom PartyTo withdraw, to go away, to retreat: These are the literal definitions of \"retire,\" but, increasingly, they fail to accurately describe the possibilities of modern retirement. If we were choosing a word today for what life looks like as we hit our mid-60s, 70s and 80s, it seems unlikely that we\u0027d land on \"retirement.\"There shall be eternal summer in the grateful heart, a poet wrote, and as this year\u0027s summer winds toward its end and elections approach, gratitude is indeed what our politicians have flowing from that space where their hearts should be.Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanySenior writer, Moyers \u0026 Company on public TV.

But for some, it will be a nightmare. Specifically the nightmare of sexual assault for one in five female coeds. You read that right -- one in five.Money Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsWe have a global warming president presiding over a massive expansion of fossil fuel production. Think of this as a form of collective mental compartmentalization that should frighten us all -- and yet from the president on down, it\u0027s remarkable how few seem disturbed by it.Author and Professor of Peace and World-Security Studies, Hampshire CollegeIf the Walton family is truly interested in helping every child achieve a high-quality education, they could begin by committing to pay their own workers a decent wage instead of spending their billions to wipe out our nation\u0027s public school system.President, American Federation of TeachersInternational President, United Food and Commercial Workers UnionAs surely -- if not as enthusiastically -- as his predecessor, Obama has succumbed to the powerful systemic pressures that serve the needs of the military-intelligence-industrial complex. Secrecy is rampant. Politics drives policy. There is no accountability.Senior Writer, The InterceptAmericans prefer to believe that all problems have solutions. There may, however, be no obvious or at least immediate solution when it comes to ISIS, an organization based on exclusivity and divisiveness in a region that couldn\u0027t be more divided.Editor, TomDispatch.comThe Netanyahu-led government\u0027s announcement of its decision to annex nearly 1,000 acres of Palestinian land in the West Bank between the Etzion settlement block and Jerusalem amounts to nothing less than a reckless and offensive act that only further undermines Israel\u0027s moral international standing and has dire future consequences.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUFive dogs. 12 weeks.

And the dogs didn\u0027t charge for their services.Wellness Editor, The Huffington Post; Doctor of acupuncture and Oriental medicine; Nutritionist; Animal Welfare AdvocateThe real target of ISIS must be the Hijaz -- the seizure of Mecca and Medina -- and the legitimacy that this will confer on ISIS as the new Emirs of Arabia. We should understand that there is really almost nothing that the West can now do about it but sit and watch.Fmr. MI-6 agent; Author, \u0027Resistance: The Essence of Islamic Revolution\u0027Across the country it\u0027s back to school time. I hope it is a year full of promise and not disappointment and added stress for all children -- especially those most vulnerable. I also hope this school year begins with a renewed commitment to help every child succeed.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe function of Ex-Im is to subsidize businesses that export American products. The major problem with this agency comes from the fact that a big bulk of Ex-Im funds go to huge, wealthy companies, such as the Ex-Im\u0027s largest beneficiary Boeing, which in 2013 received 30 percent of its loans and guarantees.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorI was discussing an upcoming New Orleans trip with friend and fellow foodie Jessica Collins. She said \"When I took my first bite of turtle soup at Commander\u0027s Palace, I knew there was no other city I could be in than New Orleans.\" Truer words have never been spoken.Owner Traveler\u0027s Bookcase, co-founder Oscar and Mae literary salon, travel expert and writer, 80s aficionado, bicycle lover.While Libya may not make the front page on a daily basis, it stands as the latest example of blowback, the adverse consequences of our reflexive military intervention.Former 16-year member of the U.S. Congress and two-time U.S. presidential candidateThese women have have lives. Have bodies. Have sex. Take pictures. Trust people. I am sorry their privacy was violated, but I am not surprised that under their clothes and professional demeanors, they\u0027re simply human beings who like to have sex as much as the next person.This week, millions of young people head to college and universities, aiming for a four-year liberal arts degree. They assume that degree is the only gateway to the American middle class. It shouldn\u0027t be.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027As our country moves forward with awareness and acknowledgment of the epidemic of rape on campus, someone\u0027s been left behind: our college men.President, The New AgendaThe NFL is a league that tolerates homophobia, the lofty words of its officials notwithstanding. And until LGBT groups and politicians stand up and take it on rather than cowering, homophobia will continue to get a pass.Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesJoan Rivers had a barbed tongue but she also had a soft spot for animals. Despite her penchant for wearing fur, Joan always appreciated PETA\u0027s efforts.Senior vice president, PETA; Author, Committed: A Rabble Rouser\u0027s MemoirFor the past 48 hours, every time I\u0027ve gone to that sad place about the unexpected -- unfathomable -- passing of my friend, Joan Rivers, I\u0027ve found myself, just a few moments later, beginning to laugh.Award-winning actress, author and activistIn our rush to return to war in Iraq we are playing into the Islamic State\u0027s hands, just as we played into the hands of al Qaeda in Iraq in 2004 and into Osama bin Laden\u0027s larger strategy with our morally disastrous Global War on Terror.Senior Fellow, Center for International Policy; Board of Directors, Council for a Livable World; MatthewHoh.comThe anger at Amber Rose comes from a place of fear -- all hate is fear, at its root -- fear of a woman who exists outside of patriarchal parameters.

Forget being normal, she says: Be extraordinary.\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"The ISIS challenge is, at its core, a war of ideas. We need to recognize that while it is possible to destroy an ideology, doing so is not easy, and it cannot be done without an effective, fully supported counter message.Director, Center on Congress at Indiana UniversityOver two nights, our conversation covered many things -- her devotion to her family, her legendary work ethic, her delight in making people laugh -- and then it took on what turned out to be a prescient dimension.PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorWhat is starkly noticeable in the wake of Rivers\u0027 death is how much has changed for funny ladies since Rivers first walked onto the Tonight Show stage in 1965.An award-winning freelance writer covering religion, culture \u0026 philanthropy.No one ever told me how irrationally crushed I would be the first time my little girl wanted to marry the silly, handsome boy from preschool instead of me.Writer at thedadissues.com, Husband to Mary and stay-at-home dad to three small children.Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"ANOTHER NBA OWNER GOES WRONG ON RACE",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
