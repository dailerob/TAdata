{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editorial Director, AOL Huffington Post Media GroupEd Conard\u0027s book Unintended Consequences is on The New York Times best-seller list, but it was hard to find at my neighborhood Washington bookstore, Politics and Prose, deep in what you could call Obama Country. That\u0027s too bad. Mitt Romney is running his campaign so close to the vest as to be nearly invisible. The theory is to disappear, leaving President Obama to run against himself and his record on the economy. So if you want to know where Romney is coming from, you need to read not only the Book of Mormon and clips from The Boston Globe and his tax returns, you also need to read Conard\u0027s technical but fervent paean to the folks whom the soon-to-be Republican presidential nominee reverently calls \"the job creators.\" That is: America\u0027s wealthiest and yearning-to-be-wealthiest.Read Post | Comments (69)Marlo Thomas, 07/24/12Award-winning actress, author, and activistThis Friday night, July 27th, the eyes of the world will turn to London as the 2012 Olympic Games begin.

Talbott, 07/24/12Author, \"Survival Investing: How to Prosper Amid Thieving Banks and Corrupt Governments\"Bloomberg Business News and the Washington Post are guessing that Romney may have paid near zero federal taxes in 2009 due to losses on his investments resulting from the financial crisis.
