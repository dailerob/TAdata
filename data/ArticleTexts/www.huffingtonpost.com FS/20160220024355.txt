{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Children\u0027s Defense FundVisitors to the U.S. Capitol can see a marker in the building’s Emancipation Hall honoring the slaves and other laborers who helped construct it. Beneath the inscription on a marble platform is a large chunk of sandstone from the Capitol’s original East Front Portico, with chisel marks still visible. Even with important steps like these, so much more of this other Washington remains hidden and forgotten. It’s time to uncover and remember these parts of our shared history -- in Washington and in states and cities and small towns across the country. Each February should remind us all that, just as the new National Museum of African-American History and Culture will tell America’s story, Black history is American history. An honest accounting of the past is the best way to keep moving forward together.Everyone following the Democratic presidential primary race almost certainly heard about the Big Letter.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027With a long and well documented trail of corrupt practices that continue to unfold by the day, it is disheartening, but not surprising, that over the course of the past few weeks, a credible theory has emerged that the upcoming election for the FIFA President will be no more than mere window dressing for pre-cooked backroom deals among the old FIFA guard.Former President, East Timor, 1996 Nobel Peace Prize laureateHillary\u0027s pledge to deliver on all her promises is at the heart of her pitch to Democratic voters. It is demonstrably false. The minimum wage and health care are just two examples of promises Hillary Clinton is unlikely to keep.Entertainment attorney, producer, writer and political activistWhen brands like MAC highlight the beauty of black women, it makes a powerful statement and takes a huge step toward eliminating a monolithic standard of beauty. To the Internet trolls, I say have several seats and bask in this #BlackGirlMagic.Executive Fashion And Beauty Editor, The Huffington PostJustice Scalia espoused the doctrine of \"originalism,\" which meant that in cases, he interpreted the Constitution by the \"original public meaning\" of the words written by the framers, as understood nearly 240 years ago. That was, he believed, the only way to insulate the Constitution from the personal values of judges and the political winds of the day.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorWatching the procedural details getting worked out can get pretty boring, which is why you won\u0027t hear many news reports about it. But underlying this dragged-out ho-hum process is a critical fact: The government could have avoided putting itself on trial and instead focused on seeking accountability for the mass murder that took place simply by conceding its mistakes from the beginning and working out an accommodation in an experienced federal civilian court.Senior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstAs long as the Sunni Iraqis do not know what the future has in store for them, they will be unwilling to make the necessary sacrifices to battle ISIS only to benefit the Shiite government in Baghdad, which they despise even more than ISIS.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUWhat if we used everything we knew about the root causes of partner violence and put our full resources and expertise to work? What could we create to heal our communities? How much pain and trauma could we prevent? How many lives could we save?Writer, Emotional Health AdvocateYou might have read the Apple CEO\u0027s open response to the U.S. government earlier today. They are demanding access to an iPhone that was involved in the San Bernardino attacks. But what exactly is the FBI demanding here, how does all this actually work, and why is this such a big deal?iOS and Mac developer, Founder of NXTBGTHNGAs the world focuses on the war in Syria, the refugee crisis in Europe, and the primary slugfest in the United States, the two Koreas are heading toward a catastrophe in the Far East.Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogThe personality extremes associated with entrepreneurship often aren\u0027t all that different from those associated with mental illness, especially bipolar disorder and depression.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarFebruary is Black History Month -- and along with it comes the inevitable onslaught of facepalm-worthy comments on the Internet from certain white people.Writer, musician, lover of life.Imagine if the government required you to have a combination lock on your door and to give it the key. It would create security and privacy risks for you and your family. This is what could happen if we required the technology industry to add back doors to its software and devices.Academic, Researcher, Writer, EntrepreneurWhile serving as a Marine in the Vietnam War, Ron Kovic suffered a spinal cord injury that left him paralyzed from the chest down. Kovic\u0027s book, Born On the Fourth of July, published 40 years ago, discusses his time on the battlefield as well as the fight after coming home to end the war and get better treatment for veterans.Editor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027They Know Everything About You\u0027The problem is that Manny didn\u0027t become anti-gay this week, and Nike has had an endorsement deal with Manny since the mid-2000s. Nike has sold a large fortune\u0027s worth of products based on Manny\u0027s good word.Fintech entrepreneur and founder of Executive Pride (ExecutivePride.org), a network of executives supporting LGBT rightsTogether we can make Facebook into a free society of the citizens, by the citizens, and for the citizens, based on our innate rights as human beings. I ask for everyone\u0027s support.Director, The Asia InstituteFalling in love with my son -- and by extension, babies in general -- only further cemented my conviction that abortion should be available on demand, for any reason.Media funded and run by women.Albright shouldn\u0027t have used the quote in the context she did during her campaign stop, but I feel the quote itself is being needlessly attacked. You see, I find it hard to separate my college from that quote.New York-based entertainment journalistThe Catholic Church constructs barriers while speaking in doublespeak saying \"we love you,\" \"we welcome you,\" \"we offer you \u0027Christian love,\u0027\" and \"we are here to help you change your unwanted attractions and gender identities and expressions.\"Independent WriterWith the GOP \"Fight Club Tour 2016\" currently in South Carolina, it\u0027s a good time to trot out one of those old clichés about our two political parties. It goes like this: Democrats fall in love; Republicans fall in line.Author/Professor, Miami University, Oxford, OhioThe current VA system is ill-equipped to handle the current numbers of female veterans, in other words. What will happen when those numbers only continue to raise and place more strain on an already struggling process.Veteran, writer, and brain health warrior being portrayed in the film \"Light Wounds\"My stepmother died August 1, 2012. I returned to Florida for the interment of her ashes October 19, and my 84-year-old father announced he wanted to get married again. I suggested we start with a dog.Award-winning freelance actor, director and writerLast Month Secretary of State John Kerry traveled to Riyadh to reassure the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states that the U.S. stood with them. \"Nothing has changed\" as a result of the nuclear pact with Iran, he insisted.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteLast night\u0027s town hall in Nevada revealed a crucial difference between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. Bernie came out strongly for a $15 per hour minimum wage. A living wage, as he called it. Hillary demurred, suggesting that $12 per hour was sufficient.Writer, Professor, Retired Lt. Colonel, Air ForceOnce I was in the gallery of the House Chamber, I was overwhelmed with the history of this place and space. During this powerful moment, I had an epiphany about the people before us who had gone through the difficulties and hardships in this land of America.Physician, Writer, Community AdvocateVisiting your family in Iran does not connote an \"allegiance\" to the Iranian government. Being born to an Iranian parent does not make you less of an American.Executive Director, NIAC ActionScot Sanborn stood behind the bar and concentrated on a drinking glass. He wiped it clean and carefully laid the glass on the bar, alongside another just like it. He pointed at each glass and counted in silence, save for the soft jazz that came from a speaker set high in the corner of the candle-lit room.Father of twins, journalist, writer, lover of bourbon, wine and great beerTo lose a child is to lose the very heart and soul of you. It is overwhelmingly disorienting. It takes a long, long time to find yourself again. It takes a long time to grow new life around the chasm of such grave loss. It takes a long time to grow beauty from ashes.Writer, author, grief advocate, founder of ABedForMyHeart.comIt\u0027s strange to me to think about how much effort I expended for something which no one around me cares about. No one asks about it, I have no connection to other alums, it doesn\u0027t affect my career in any meaningful way.Actor, ex-Google / AmazonI irrationally trust that work can\u0027t hurt me in a way that love could, and so work has become the one exercise through which I\u0027ve known how to navigate my life. Deep down, I doubt whether this single-mindedness to work is sustainable or simply an anesthetic from a greater truth.Student, Yale UniversityGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
