{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027While the Administration and the Republicans and far too much of the commentariat are obsessed with public debt, private debts are killing the recovery. Some 22 percent of mortgages are still under water, and student debt has surpassed a trillion dollars. Banks can unload their toxic securities onto the Fed. Corporations can use the bankruptcy code\u0027s Chapter 11 to write off old debts (including to their pensioners) and get a \"fresh start.\" But college borrowers stay indentured forever, as do underwater homeowners unless they want to lose the house.The upside-down policy, of cutting public spending, giving debt relief to banks and corporations, while showing no mercy to students and homeowners, keeps the whole economy in debtors\u0027 prison. Until these policies change, we can look forward to a decade of high unemployment and an underperforming economy.CommentsDavid BromwichProfessor of Literature at YaleIs America at War with Islam? The question began to be asked when the first evidence emerged of the transfer of hundreds of innocent Muslims to Guantanamo and the despotic new order that permitted indefinite detention of suspects.Comments (225)Gary HartPresident, Hart International, Ltd.By the time we reach the 2014 election, almost one third of the current Senate will have resigned in the past three elections. Recent reports indicate that those formerly considered to be virtually automatic candidates are rejecting the opportunity to seek the vacated seats.Comments (54)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Repealing laws by hollowing them out -- failing to fund their enforcement or implementation -- works because the public doesn\u0027t know it\u0027s happening. Enactment of a law attracts attention; de-funding it doesn\u0027t.CommentsRandi ZuckerbergFounder and CEO, Zuckerberg Media; Editor-In-Chief, Dot ComplicatedAs parents, we need to ask ourselves whether we\u0027re posting photos for our children or for ourselves. And if you\u0027re posting it for yourself, wait a little bit before pressing the \"share\" button so you can really think about if it\u0027s in your child\u0027s best interest.CommentsKim SimonMother, Wife, Blogger, mamabythebay.comThe mothers who have walked this road before me tell me that new babies find more curves of your body to snuggle into, everyone fitting perfectly, nestled together like a set of measuring spoons that were always meant to accompany each other. I suppose that it must be true. But what if it isn\u0027t?CommentsHuffPost RadioWhile both sides can lapse into \"content bias,\" should the following facts alter pre-conceived views: the Boston bombers were young Muslim men; some sarin gas was detected in Syria; the Reinhart-Rogoff study is flawed? Erick Erickson and Ron Reagan debate.CommentsSteven StraussAdjunct Lecturer in Public Policy, Harvard Kennedy SchoolOnly hypocrisy and demagoguery can explain Republican opposition to gun regulation, alleging potential infringement of constitutional freedoms alongside Republican support for monitoring American citizens based solely on religion and empowering the government to deprive citizens of their rights, by deeming them enemy combatants.CommentsC. M. RubinBlogger and author, \u0027The Real Alice in Wonderland\u0027During the course of my son\u0027s elementary and secondary school education, he has been able to forge warm and in some cases life-changing relationships with remarkable teachers.CommentsMike Weisser\u0027The Gun Guy\u0027 at EvolveSorry I couldn\u0027t make it to the annual meeting. I\u0027m a Life Member and I try to get there every year. But this year is different. If I showed up you\u0027d tried to get me to help you fight a \"culture war.\" But if there is a war going on, you represent the wrong side.Comments (38)Carly FiorinaGlobal Ambassador for Opportunity InternationalIn developing countries, women are disproportionately affected by the challenges of extreme poverty yet time and time again find the courage to provide a brighter future for their children.CommentsEcumenical Patriarch BartholomewSpiritual leader of 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwideThe Resurrection challenges us to reflect on where we most deeply experience hostility and disunity. Images of this reality abound: Within the space of only a few weeks, in America alone, we have painfully witnessed the loss of children to gun violence, the loss of life to religious radicalism and the loss of residents to a plant explosion.Comments (81)Noel A. PoyoExecutive Director for the National Association for Latino Community Asset Builders (NALCAB)Too much emphasis has been put on immigration reform as a social policy that will benefit immigrants, and not enough has been done to highlight the positive economic impact that immigration reform will have on entire cities and regions.CommentsAngela MaiersEducator, Author, SpeakerMy engagement usually has an official sounding title. I conduct \"walk-throughs\" and \"technology audits,\" and advise on \"best practices for technology integration.\" So what is the first piece of advice I offer to every group of educators I advise?CommentsDave JohnsonFellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FuturePresident Obama set a goal of 1 million new manufacturing jobs in his second term. Last month we added zero. Not one. Nada. Zip. We did add low-wage jobs, though. Maybe we can talk about a national manufacturing strategy now?Comments (24)Tanya D. MarshProfessor, Wake Forest Law SchoolAfter a person dies, we clearly need to make decisions regarding final disposition, for public health reasons as well as closure for the family and community. But what happens when the remains are those of a person believed to have committed a horrific, recent crime?CommentsBhaskar ChakravortiSenior Associate Dean of International Business \u0026 Finance, The Fletcher School at Tufts UniversityThere is, indeed, a bomb waiting to go off on the Korean Peninsula, but it is not of the Kim Jong-un\u0027s making. Seoul and its allies in the U.S. and elsewhere must give equal -- if not greater emphasis -- to the very real and complex crisis that might cause the Korean economic miracle to implode.CommentsAli A. RizviPakistani-Canadian writer, physician and musicianMuslims have rightly complained about the Israeli government labeling them anti-Semitic for legitimate criticism of Israeli policy, but today Muslims (along with liberal apologist allies) are doing the same thing with their broad use of the \"Islamophobia\" label against the \"new atheists.\"Comments (615)Carre OtisWife, mother, author, activist, modelI\u0027ve come to understand that language impacts thought, and vice versa. Without owning the word \"no,\" and all the other language under what I like to think of as the \"No Umbrella,\" I was denying myself the conviction and power that comes with it.CommentsJeff DanzigerPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideCommentsWillow DeaIntegral Education Pioneer, Editor, \u0027Igniting Brilliance: Integral Education in the 21st Century\u0027When you reflect on the quality of the relationship between yourself and your teacher, isn\u0027t it fundamentally because you were trusted? Because you felt safe? Because you sensed that they believed in you?CommentsTammy Nelson, Ph.D.Sex and relationship expert; Psychotherapist; Author of The New Monogamy and Getting the Sex You Want; International speakerYour friend calls you in the middle of the night, crying. She sniffles and barely manages to say, \"He did it again. He cheated!\"Comments (140)Ellen DolgenAuthor, \u0027Shmirshky: The Pursuit of Hormone Happiness\u0027So now that you are motivated to meditate, here are three quick and easy meditations for finding menopausal bliss.CommentsFahad HassanFounder and CEO, Always PreppedI want to bring special attention to the \"non-traditional\" teachers we\u0027ve all had that are often the unsung heroes of our lives. I\u0027m talking about our coaches, mentors, friends, and even our first few bosses who hired us for all those summer internships.CommentsTerri BarnesSpouse Calls, Stars and StripesMilitary members and families are not cultural aberrants looking for a cold niche in which to hide. We are not cold timid souls whose lack of emotion leads us to a military life scrubbed of feeling. The experiences of our lives, much like yours, are inextricably tied to our emotions.CommentsJim FloodFreelance writerEven before NBA player Jason Collins came out as gay, the lack of out gay men in pro sports was a major theme in the media. But at other levels -- high school, college, recreational, amateur --there are plenty of gay men in team sports. One such sport is roller derby.Comments (16)Sarah HodgsonProfessional dog trainerThough I\u0027m often called the miracle worker, it\u0027s the dogs that always impress me. The most forgiving and trusting of all the earth\u0027s creatures, I\u0027m left in awe of their healing abilities.CommentsMatthew B.
