{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Attorney, advocate, writer at RepublicReport.orgLast week, at a critical point in the Paris negotiations on global climate change, Secretary of State John Kerry announced that the United States would commit $800 million annually to help developing nations adapt to a warming climate and move to cleaner energy. $800 million doubled the prior U.S. pledge, and the announcement may have helped seal the deal. $800 million is a great deal of money. But it is actually less than U.S. taxpayers provided in the past year to each of five major for-profit college companies -- all of which have been under investigation in recent years by federal and state law enforcement agencies for deceiving their students, lying to government regulators, and other abuses.I am guessing this is probably not the last time I will say the wrong thing, or say something the wrong way. I promise to keep learning, and to try to be more articulate in the future. We have a lot of hard work to do. I am looking forward to doing it together.Public speaker, activist, OlympianThe anxious class feels vulnerable to forces over which they have no control. Terrible things happen for no reason. Yet government can\u0027t be counted on to protect them.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027Public health research on gun violence by the CDC and NIH can save Americans from firearm injury and deaths. Congress must support scientists who are willing to ask tough questions, do credible analyses, and share truthful conclusions.Host of \"Dr. America\" on We Act Radio, pediatrician in Washington DC, member of the National Physicians AllianceHowever brilliant Jeff Bezos may be, the public should recognize that his success has come with a huge helping hand from the taxpayers. He has received in the neighborhood of $4 billion in subsidies from taxpayers over the last two decades to help his business grow.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027These days many people shy away from entertaining, especially a crowd. This is a shame. Holiday parties end up being held at the office, which is no fun for anyone. The Chrismukkah holiday season is a wonderful excuse to bring together friends.Creative Director and CEO, Fig Tree \u0026 VineLittle more than unadulterated racist hatred, Trump\u0027s anti-Muslim diatribe must have greatly pleased ISIS\u0027s delusional leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.Alaraby TVOne cannot understate the importance of the agreement arrived at in Paris. For the first time, world leaders have faced up to the stark warnings that climate scientists have been issuing for years, instead of shrinking away with denial and delay. And while the commitments made in Paris aren\u0027t on their own enough to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations at safe levels, they are enough to begin bending the emissions curve towards a safe climate. Paris is a beginning of a process.Director of Penn State Earth System Science Center; Author of \u0027Dire Predictions\u0027 and \u0027The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars\u0027The theme is to desperately convince us that Sanders can\u0027t win. They repeat it over and over, even though Sanders polls as well or better than Hillary Clinton does against every leading Republican candidate.Executive director, National Nurses United (AFL-CIO) and California Nurses AssociationIf you like your lies served BIG, BIGGER, BEST, then this was the year for you! In 2015, lies were everywhere: in international sports, presidential campaigns, at the largest corporations and important non-profits, among Super Bowl contenders, and even among those tasked with telling us the news.Founder and CEO, CalibrateThe Modi dream is fading. An Economist report found him widely described as an \"authoritarian\" and a \"megalomaniac\" even by supporters. More important, by all accounts, he does not believe in a liberal free market. Rather, like so many Republican politicians who routinely applaud free enterprise, he is more pro-business than pro-market.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstitutePeople across the world using the platform for various purposes at once, all coalescing around one isolated event -- that is completely unprecedented.Vocativ - news sourced from the deep web.For good and often surrealistic entertainment, read the Journal. I do every morning. For serious business analysis, it\u0027s The Financial Times and other specialized business outlets.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia UniversityWashington has been the main contributor to the emergence of a singularly complex challenge that threatens our interests and the stability of the region. We only compound our culpability while reducing the chances of finding a tolerable way out of the jam if we remain addicted to fanciful thinking.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghIn a system still characterized by entrenched patriarchy, voting for municipal council seats might seem like progress, or simply window dressing.Co-founder, CODEPINK: Women for PeaceAmerica has been a sitting duck for a figure like Trump for a long time. More and more Americans are simply disconnected from government, politics and civic life. They are deeply cynical. Voting turnout keeps falling, especially among lower income people.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Division and diversion help the one percent capture government, securing policies that further enrich the rich, like trickle-down economics under which no benefits ever actually descend, bailouts for Wall Street but not Main Street and job-destroying trade deals like NAFTA and the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership.International President, United SteelworkersNational security experts across the political spectrum say Syrian refugees not only pose less risk than anyone else who comes to the United States, but rejecting them plays right into the terrorists\u0027 strategy of stoking global conflict.Senior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstChampions of the colorblind mythology dangerously misuse Dr. King\u0027s axiom that we should judge people by content of their character, not color of their skin, to hold that if we simply ignore race in the application process, racism will dissipate. The problem with such conceptions is that, followed to their logical roots, they are incredibly flawed.Writer, Researcher, EducatorIt is not often that Democratic and Republican insurgent candidates for President achieve such prominence and maintain staying power against the establishment \"pols\" of the two-party duopoly that manages elections for the plutocracy that finances campaigns.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorTrump\u0027s racist commentary about Muslims is dangerous, divisive and disgusting -- but what is worse is that he doesn\u0027t need to win to do irreparable damage to America. And sadly none of this should come as a surprise. Hate speech against Muslims is nothing new.VICE Correspondent \u0026 Emmy-nominated JournalistWhen posed with the possibility of war, in theory, Americans like the idea of invading other countries. In practice -- when lives are actually lost -- they like invading other countries much less. When an invasion seems like it might be costly, Americans often prefer more limited airstrikes or no military involvement at all.Professor and Fellow, Department of Communication and Public Policy Research Institute, Texas A\u0026M UniversityPresidential Professor \u0026 Chair of Political Science at the University of OklahomaFear is on the rise in the U.S. Politicians who stoke fear like Donald Trump benefit in their poll numbers. Strength is not giving in to enemy-stereotyping and it is the only way we will defeat ISIS and the temptation it offers us to overreact. Strength is not giving in to enemy-stereotyping in our domestic political struggles.Professor of Theology, Chicago Theological SeminaryThere\u0027s always been this rhetoric that people of color who are accepted into these schools are accepted because of their skin color due to Affirmative Action.if this writing stuff doesn\u0027t pan out catch me residing in the suburbs owning a bunch of burger king franchises2015 can be viewed as the year in which the epochal transition from one set of fuels to another took off, with renewables making such significant strides that, for the first time in centuries, the beginning of the end of the Fossil Fuel Era has come into sight.Author and Professor of Peace and World-Security Studies, Hampshire CollegeBeyond ratifying the substantial, but inadequate, voluntary national commitments to lower climate emissions, which had already emerged as the first major Paris contribution to climate progress, the final Paris agreement opened three major avenues for climate advocates and solutions.Former executive director and chairman, Sierra ClubIf the filmmakers had taken enough time to get to know real transgender people prior to making this film, the depiction of Lili would have been one of a lucid, reasonable person trying to live honestly to herself in the midst of a world that wants to interpret and label her as crazy.LGBT activist and software engineer working in the aeronautics industryAs many of his guests are Arabs and Muslims, he operates an Arabic-language website in an unabashed marketing effort to get Arabs and Muslims to come to the United States and enjoy the fruits of our country.Former reporter for the New York Times and Daily News; taught Political Science at NYUIn 2016, New Hampshire and Iowa will save the nation from a future of endless quagmires, especially since Bernie Sanders offers a fresh approach to foreign policy and so many other key issues. History will be written by human beings, not skewed polls.Columnist published in The Cleveland Plain Dealer, The Baltimore Sun, The Hill, Salon, The Jerusalem Post www.hagoodman.comIf you truly wish to maintain the Bush family\u0027s dynastic hold on the White House, I have some advice for you. It\u0027s going to sound aggressive, especially for a mild-mannered softy like you, but if I were you I\u0027d take my anemic 5 percent and roll the dice. You have nothing to lose, and everything to gain.Political and Pop Culture AnalystThis week, we celebrate the year\u0027s most anticipated film, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, by welcoming two visionary icons central to the movie\u0027s creation.PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
