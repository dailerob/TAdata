{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027Restated for the 21st century, \"socialism\" simply means that a people\u0027s judgments about its own economic life come before the supposedly iron rules of the international economy. It would be fair to call it \"economic democracy.\" The condescending view of the Greeks as somehow not understanding economic reason and the direction of history writes off this kind of economic democracy as infeasible, archaic, and probably senseless. Syriza\u0027s government has a chance to reverse the lens. Economic democracy (or, as Syriza calls it, socialism) is politics that puts human needs first and accepts that market-based destabilization, impoverishment, and humiliation are not natural disasters or comeuppance for bad behavior but forms of political violence.My president doesn\u0027t love me. How sad! But forget me, I\u0027m just another citizen. The real tragedy here, I just learned, is that the president doesn\u0027t love Rudy Giuliani, a man who was an honest-to-God elected official.Founder, People for the American WayIt is not Greece that is broken, it is the world\u0027s financial system and banks that need repair. And that cannot happen given their lobbying control over our governments.Bestselling author of Survival Investing: How to Prosper Amid Thieving Banks and Corrupt Governments and professor of finance at S P Jain School of Global ManagementFriends of liberty worldwide should offer aid and support to Burmese activists seeking to transform what remains an authoritarian system. Such assistance best comes outside of the U.S. government, lest democracy promotion be seen as yet another tool of American foreign policy.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteIf people are afraid -- and it is fear that underlies the refusal to vaccinate -- they don\u0027t need to be badgered or sneered at, they need to be reassured. And that reassurance comes best from someone they trust. If not Roald Dahl, perhaps an older person who might remember what it was like before vaccines.Executive Director, National Center for Science EducationWe know that military means alone will not achieve our goals of peace and security in the Middle East. In addition to passing the AUMF, the Congress should take the far-sighted step of passing the Women, Peace and Security Act at the same time.CEO, The Carter CenterThe history in Internet innovation is the story of outsiders building a better mouse trap -- kids, dropouts, and non-Americans, given a neutral platform to prove their ideas. It was neutral because it was built that way.Author, \u0027Republic, Lost\u0027; Founder, RootstrikersFor the entire first year of your life, Cody, I kept wondering when the wonderment of being your mother would wear off. And after 12 months of diapers and white noise, nursing and nighttime battles, babbles and snuggles and something new learned every day, I\u0027ve come to the conclusion that it never will.Writer, therapist, new momOne of the most important goals of gender violence prevention work is to teach boys and young men that violence is not manly, and abuse is not sexy. To the extent that this movie complicates our efforts, it harms not just women. It also does damage to young heterosexual men.Educator, author, filmmaker, and cultural theoristI\u0027ve been accused of being responsible for the loss of innocent lives and labeled a Nazi who is having Muslims for breakfast.Foreign Editor, Jyllands-Posten and author of “The Tyranny of Silence\"Things will only start to change once we stop blaming women, and start challenging the flawed system they must navigate. And I have no problem saying that assertively.practical dreamer. hopeful realist. ravishly.com co-editor.The president says he\u0027ll veto the Keystone XL pipeline. He should do more, and put an end to the project altogether. He has the authority.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The Israeli general election, scheduled for March 17, can be fateful for the Israeli Arabs. If they want equal distribution of resources to improve their socioeconomic conditions, fully integrate into Israeli society, and contribute constructively to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, they must now fully exercise their right to vote and not squander this historic opportunity.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUAs long as Republicans keep opposing policies that most Latinos and Americans as a whole support, it\u0027s unlikely the Libre Initiative will have much success. But given the deep support and huge bank accounts of its two most important funders, the threat posed by Libre is one that we should all take seriously.President, People For the American WayTo doubt evolution at this late date is to reveal oneself to be willfully, invincibly ignorant of basic scientific principles. And there is no room in the Oval Office -- none -- for the scientifically illiterate.Professor of Law, University of St. ThomasIt isn\u0027t easy, since nothing worth doing ever is, but these first days and weeks and months will unfold and so will your love.Wife of one, mom of six boys, author, editor, musician, blogger at Crash Test Parents and Racheltoalson.comThe labor and civil rights movements worked hard to eliminate systems that perpetuate discrimination and segregation, and it is with this tradition in mind that the labor movement calls on the Supreme Court to uphold the disparate-impact protections of the Fair Housing Act to ensure fair treatment for every working American.President, AFL-CIOThe voters that make up the Republican base don\u0027t just want chili-cheese fries... they want to feast on the ground, raw, red meat of anyone who disagrees with them, while claiming that America is a Christian nation. That\u0027s the kind of diet we should make fun of.Columnist, National MemoMuch attention has rightly been paid to reforming student loans, such as making sure borrowers can refinance high-interest loans and expanding income-based payment options. These programs, though they would help millions of struggling borrowers, aren\u0027t a tourniquet, but only a bandage on a $1.2 trillion student debt crisis.Digital Strategy Manager, Young InvinciblesMany people unnecessarily lose energy in ways they are not aware of that are actually changeable, even if you can\u0027t currently get off your treadmill. If you can stop that depletion, you can find the strength to change your situation.Clinical psychologist and marriage counselor for over 40 years, founder of heroiclove.comThis is my first fully public statement criticizing a sitting Israeli government official. This statement comes after careful consideration because I am heartbroken about the current state of affairs. Like an increasing number of American Jews, I want to make it clear that Netanyahu does not speak for me.Director, Center for Jewish Ethics, Reconstructionist Rabbinical CollegeI never knew how much I was truly cared about or that I actually influence people\u0027s lives. Society has a tendency to see me as a broken individual, but with love, I\u0027ve learned to shatter those lenses and begin to see myself as a source of love.US Paralympic Athlete, Disability AdvocateATMs randomly coughing up cash -- and a lot of it. Like an international lottery, the phenomenon has occurred in more than 30 countries, leading to potentially as much as $1 billion in stolen funds.Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911So is James really the worst writer ever? Not exactly. We found similar errors in the work of everyone from Nicholas Sparks to Edith Wharton. When it comes to grammar goofs, no writer is immune.Automated ProofreaderSome of the best science fiction out there has been penned by women, and we could go on for hours naming all the female writers who have contributed to and changed the landscape of SF.AuthorShould non-violent animal rights activists really be charged as \"terrorists\"? The fur lobby says yes. Common sense and the Constitution say otherwise.This year\u0027s All-Star Game was a blast, continuing the high-scoring trend we\u0027ve seen lately in these yearly exhibitions. Fans vote in players they love to see put the ball in the basket, and it\u0027d be silly to deny them that right.High school studentPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideOver the past few days and weeks, we have seen too much evidence that far from being a painful memory of the past, anti-Semitism is still very much alive in Europe.Europe researcher, Human Rights WatchOur campaigns don\u0027t feature issue debates. But win or lose, a strong populist run would strengthen the rising movement on the left of the Democratic Party.President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureWe need to stop using military force as a solution to everything -- indeed, it is a solution to nothing. We must push for the repeal of the 2001 AUMF and prevent the passage of a new AUMF. We cannot rely on Congress or the president to reverse the course of rampant U.S. militarism. It is up to us to make our voices heard.Professor, Thomas Jefferson School of LawGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"\u0027CHRISTIE BUBBLE\u0027 LAGGING ALREADY",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
