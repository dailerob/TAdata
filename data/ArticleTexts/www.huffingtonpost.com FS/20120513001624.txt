{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Fellow, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesFinancial markets are inherently unstable. They will neither self-correct nor self-regulate. Their instability poses a threat to markets and economies and people across the globe. Therefore, they need to be regulated. That\u0027s not to say that anyone knows the best way to do this yet in order to balance the necessity of oversight with the dynamics of the markets. We don\u0027t know where to set the speed limits. It must be an iterative process. But we do know they need to be set, and JP Morgan\u0027s loss should be taken as a warning that our tendency is to set them too low. And it should be taken as an even bigger warning against positions like that of Gov. Romney that Dodd-Frank should be repealed.Read Post | Comments (33)Matt Damon and Gary White, 05/12/12Mother\u0027s Day is another day where in many countries women will be responsible for finding and fetching water for their families.Read Post | Comments (20)Mark Hyman, MD, 05/12/12Practicing physicianWhat are you doing in your home, your family, in your schools and communities to end the attack on our children and our nation\u0027s future?

Mothers in the Congo face unimaginable hardships. But there\u0027s hope in amazing community-based organizations.Read Post | CommentsClaire McCarthy, M.D., 05/12/12Pediatrician, Children\u0027s Hospital Boston, Harvard Medical SchoolI am the mother of a child who died. And that makes Mother\u0027s Day very hard. Other days of the year you can pretend that you are an ordinary person and that life is normal. But not on Mother\u0027s Day.Read Post | Comments (41)James Zogby, 05/12/12President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Don\u0027t hold your breath expecting big things, either bad or good, from this big new government.

She has taught me tolerance, patience, caregiving, and unconditional love. She was the original calm and assertive person in my life.Read Post | CommentsJanet Tavakoli, 05/12/12President, Tavakoli Structured FinanceThe United States is trying to pull out of the greatest financial tailspins in its history. Dice-rolling braggadacio by a key officer at one of the nation\u0027s largest banks is exactly the kind of thing Congress, taxpayers and voters should find scary.Read Post | Comments (13)Noel Irwin Hentschel, 05/11/12Chairman, CEO and co-Founder, AmericanTours InternationalIn a world more focused on material gain and personal status, let us highlight the fruits of spiritual growth and shared virtues.Read Post | CommentsHelen Croydon, 05/11/12Author, Journalist and BroadcasterThis week I was interviewing long-term happy bachelors for a women\u0027s magazine on the rise of singledom. When I say long-term, I mean willingly long-term. Not the spluttering, nervous, perspiring ones who hang around speed dating events desperate to find a girlfriend.Read Post | Comments (53)John Corvino and Maggie Gallagher, 05/11/12Obama\u0027s open approval of same sex marriage represents a huge change in popular attitudes towards the issue. But does this mean greater social stigma will be directed towards those who are against changing the definition of traditional marriage?Read Post | CommentsGreta Van Susteren, 05/11/12Host of Fox News\u0027 \u0027On the Record with Greta Van Susteren\u0027Everyone (yes, everyone!) wanted that interview with President Obama this week (I would have loved it).

We\u0027ve all done stupid, callous things during our youth. But that 65-year-old man does not deserve a pass for the way he\u0027s behaving now.Read Post | Comments (418)Shannon Bradley-Colleary, 05/11/12Author, screenwriter, wife dominatrix, mom butlerThe woman on the cover, while as stunningly beautiful as the real Jamie, doesn\u0027t reflect the inclusive, intelligent, loving, nurturing, non-judgmental woman I know.Read Post | Comments (220)Priyamvada Natarajan, 05/11/12Cosmologist, Yale UniversityThe reality of how science works is in sharp contrast to the way most Americans seem to see it--perhaps as definitive, time-limited, and based on speculation or assertion.Read Post | Comments (337)Marian Wright Edelman, 05/11/12President, Children\u0027s Defense FundPrograms like Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, food stamps, and transitional housing are lifelines that work when people fall on hard times. We need to preserve them. But that\u0027s not what the Ryan \"reconciliation budget\" just passed by the House of Representatives would do.Read Post | Comments (35)Marlo Thomas, 05/11/12Award-winning actress, author, and activistBefore midday, Wednesday, May 8th, America was a different place. Millions of our people in all states were living in torment.
