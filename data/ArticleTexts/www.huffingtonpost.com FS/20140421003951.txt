{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week began the way so many do: with more tragic gun violence, as three people were killed in two shootings at Jewish centers in the Kansas City area, part of the 86 killed by guns in the U.S. every day. \"We are united in our condemnation of this heinous attack,\" said Attorney General Holder. \"These acts cannot be ignored.\" And yet, one year ago this month, the Senate rejected even a modest background check bill, despite the support of 90 percent of Americans. In the wake of the Kansas shootings, Michael Bloomberg\u0027s $50 million gun control effort, \"Everytown for Gun Safety,\" unveiled its first ad. We \"have another chance to stop a child from being killed,\" it said. We do, but only if we refuse to lower our expectations. As Gabriel García Márquez, who died on Thursday, wrote, \"It is not true that people stop pursuing dreams because they grow old, they grow old because they stop pursuing dreams.\"As the Hollywood blockbuster Transcendence debuts this weekend with Johnny Depp, Morgan Freeman and clashing visions for the future of humanity, it\u0027s tempting to dismiss the notion of highly intelligent machines as mere science fiction. But this would be a mistake, and potentially our worst mistake ever.Stephen HawkingStuart RussellMax TegmarkFrank WilczekLaurie DavidProducer, author, NRDC TrusteeThis year my book tour is taking me to a lot of colleges, and my first piece of advice is to start by defining success for yourself -- by being clear about what you want, what you value and what you are about. But to do that, we need to abandon, or at least mitigate, some of the worst practices of the adult world that students are already mired in: burnout, sleep deprivation, stress and anxiety.Arianna HuffingtonThe single most important step the US government can take to reverse discouraging economic trends is to mount a concerted, large-scale program directed at renewing our national infrastructure.Lawrence H. SummersCharles W. Eliot University Professor and President Emeritus at Harvard UniversityOne essential question has received little attention: Is amassing mountains of privacy-sensitive \"metadata\" technically necessary for effective, lawful electronic tracking and surveillance of legitimate targets? The answer is emphatically no.Joan FeigenbaumBryan FordFor so many of us, Easter is not just a religious holiday -- it is a personal celebration and re-commitment. How do we personally experience the resurrection? Every year, as I hear and say \"He is risen,\" I remember that it\u0027s not just a theological affirmation, but something I need personally.Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersThose laws should prevent or bust up concentrations of economic power that not only harm consumers but also undermine our democracy -- such as the pending Comcast acquisition of Time-Warner.Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Spill-related health problems plague the people and the wildlife of the Gulf to this very day. I personally hoped that we, as a nation, would quickly learn from this tragedy and move swiftly to prevent a repeat disaster in our most vulnerable coastal environments.Robert RedfordActor, director and environmental activistThe idea of forcing myself to enter into a certain mindset because of the date on the calendar just doesn\u0027t jive with my personality.Kristen HowertonBlogger, Rage Against the MinivanYou want to know how the working poor really live? My husband works an average of 50 hours per week just so we can barely make it paycheck to paycheck. We are the in-betweeners. Not making enough to live \"comfortably\" -- but not \"poor\" enough to get any assistance either.Ashley SchmidtbauerMother, wife, and bloggerA Louisiana elected official once said \"the flag of Texaco flies over the Louisiana State Capitol.\" Right now that flag is flapping in the face of every citizen.Robert F. Kennedy Jr.President, Waterkeeper Alliance; Senior Attorney, NRDCWe cannot treat a lack of confidence as an involuntary affliction to be tiptoed around, or as an irrational response women just need to get over already. Especially when confidence is not just a prerequisite for a job, but a requirement of the job itself. Amanda DubermanNews Editor, HuffPost WomenThere are obvious hurdles to any gun control advocacy group. There are a lot of single-issue, pro-gun voters in America but not a lot of single-issue, pro-gun-control voters.Adam WinklerProfessor of Law, UCLAThe phrase \"The customer is always right\" is typically used by businesses to convince customers that they will get good service at this company and convince employees to give customers good service; however, I think businesses should abandon this phrase once and for all.Alexander KjerulfSpeaker, consultant and authorCan you imagine how I felt when I heard that jury say I was guilty, when I knew I was in Florida at Disney World with my family when the murder was committed? I couldn\u0027t believe what was happening. It all felt like a nightmare, but one that I could never wake up from.Jonathan FlemingWrongfully convictedOn Wednesday 16, Korean media broadcasted the news about the sinking of the ferry in Jindo during the whole day. It was horrible. And the current state of Korean media is as horrible as the news.Yongjun MinFeature Editor, Elle KoreaDemocrats Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Hakeem Jeffreys of New York want to clamp down on what can be said on radio under the rubric of \"hate speech,\" and it\u0027s a terrible idea. Government should stay as far away from broadcast content as possible.Alan ColmesLiberal political commentator, host of \"The Alan Colmes Show\" on Fox News Radio, publisher of alan.com, author of \"Thank the Liberals … For Saving America\"Agapi StassinopoulosAuthor of \u0027Unbinding the Heart\u0027The truth is that the agenda of the Koch brothers is to move this country from a democratic society with a strong middle class to an oligarchic form of society in which the economic and political life of the nation are controlled by a handful of billionaire families.Sen. Bernie SandersIndependent U.S. Senator from VermontIvan Lopez\u0027s killings at Fort Hood, while on a scale not often matched, are one more marker on a bloody trail of death that leads from Iraq and Afghanistan into the American heartland, to bases and backyards nationwide.Ann JonesAuthor, \u0027They Were Soldiers: How the Wounded Return From America’s Wars -- The Untold Story\u0027Easter, if it is to mean anything, must always stands face to face with Good Friday, and the crucifixion. Because God knows the crucifixions did not stop because the resurrection happened.Paul Brandeis RaushenbushExecutive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostIn the ongoing Mommy Wars, the stay-at-home mother has been, at turns, revered and demonized. But there\u0027s a third reality that rarely enters the discussion: Moms whose choices to do one or the other -- stay home or return to work -- are not really choices at all.Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarI love looking at the silhouettes, colors, prints and fabrics worn by idols, from Grace Kelly and Jackie Onassis to modern day trend-setters like Charlotte Gainsbourg, Jessica Alba and Zooey Deschanel.Tommy HilfigerAmerican Fashion DesignerNew York City is moving forward for children -- and it isn\u0027t the only major city and school district making strides towards providing high-quality public preschool programs to as many children as possible. Several large districts that have been doing this for a while are already seeing strong results.Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundThose of us of a progressive predisposition are drifting towards a political defeat of historic proportions -- one underpinned by an economic and social settlement of a highly conservative kind -- and we are doing so with what would appear to be only the slightest sense of alarm.David CoatesWorrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsMaybe I\u0027m naïve or maybe it\u0027s because I went through years of infertility treatment but I\u0027m continually stunned at how many people ask the question, \"When are you going to have kids?\"Jennifer “Jay” PalumboWriter, Stand-Up Comic, Current Infertile, Author of the blog, ‘The 2 Week Wait,’ the Director of Patient Care at FertilityAuthority.com and a Proud IVF MomBrittney GrinerWNBA Player, Phoenix MercuryWe assign a cultural significance to sex; it is for procreation and the preservation of the family unit. We are told it is to be cherished and not commodified, but meanwhile sex screams at us from every billboard and TV channel. It seems sex can be used to sell everything except for sex itself.Belle KnoxDuke porn star; sex-positive feminist; activist for sex-worker rightsSt. Louis is already a city that has lost so many good-paying blue-collar jobs. Lyft and Uber are part of the Walmartization of America: part-time workers earning fast-food wages. These drivers are in a very real sense akin to scab workers, and like the companies they drive for, represent regression and not progression.Umar LeeCab driver, father, crime-fiction authorDon\u0027t believe the hype!
