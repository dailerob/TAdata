{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Paul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostToday we can ask ourselves the ultimate question: To what will we devote our life in this very short span of time that we have in this world? What will captivate us, be the focus of our life\u0027s energy, be what we care most about in the world. In short -- what will we worship? I use the term \u0027worship\u0027 because we worship that which we value, that which holds the highest place in the pantheon of our lives. Much of what we worship is, as we all know, not worthy of our time. We succumb to the desire for luxury that is out of our reach, or the perfect body, that will never be ours, or the status of power and intelligence that is fleeting and fraudulent. We can be aware of these unworthy objects of devotion while still spending far too much time bowing down at their altars. Yet we can replace these false idols. The decision of what is worthy of devotion, and actually devoting ourselves to it, is ours to make this New Year\u0027s and every day of our lives.Comments (79)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, Beyond OutrageDespite do-nothing congressional Republicans, we ARE making progress around the country because Americans are organizing and mobilizing. Together we can make 2014 the year we turn the tide on economic inequality.Comments (139)Tessa GouldDirector, HuffPost Partner StudioThe banter around native advertising, and more specifically native content publishing, reached fever pitch this year. Every man and his dog had a view on how it should be defined, measured, labeled, scaled and priced. And while the the jury may still be out on a number of these issues, one thing we do know here at HuffPost Partner Studio is bloody good native content when we see it.CommentsEric RobergeCertified Financial Planner, Founder of Beyond Your HammockIf there\u0027s one thing I\u0027d like you to take away from this story, it\u0027s this: Don\u0027t put off until someday all the things you know you should do today. Life is short enough, and circumstances can easily derail us from our true intentions at any moment.CommentsJillian LaurenAuthor and bloggerI resent my body and its annoying needs, its troublesome memories and emotions, its alarming register of the passing years. But I have learned time and time again that it is my only way back to feeling grounded and present in the world.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorMichael Moore\u0027s oped in today\u0027s NYT about both the shortcomings and attributes of the Affordable Care Act, on the day its coverage officially begins to kick in, gets the politics wrong but he gets the policy right in important ways.Comments (33)Jordan K. TurgeonLifestyle Blog Editor, The Huffington PostMy compulsive checking had become a burden instead of a fun way to keep in touch. I wanted to live a better, more present life, and in order to do that I had to stop bombarding myself with information on how everyone else was living theirs.CommentsScott Barry Kaufman, Ph.D.Co-founder, The Creativity Post; Author, \u0027Ungifted: Intelligence Redefined\u0027Today billions of Americans will pull out their lists of New Year\u0027s resolutions, full of intentions to control their many temptations, from one-night stands to junk food to alcohol to smoking. What are the costs of all that self-control?CommentsJennifer BenderyWhen I really think about 2013, I realize I spent most of the year looking for her. We once had a pact: If one of us died, you\u0027d have to send the other one a sign that you were okay, that you weren\u0027t reeeeeally gone but just in a different place.Comments (63)Paul AbramsLast person on Earth not on FacebookAs the D.C. media feigns apoplexy over enrollment rates in the Affordable Care Act, the rest of the country will awaken to a world in which people with pre-existing illnesses will be covered and people will not live in constant fear of being an illness away from bankruptcy.CommentsChristine PelosiChair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusAs 2014 dawns, women on the run in political office and public service have multitasking ahead. How well we juggle doing it all -- home life, work life, personal space and public engagement -- may well determine the fate of our families and our nation.CommentsGeoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoThe Intelligence Community needs to win back the trust of the American people. It can do that, not by being defensive, but by acknowledging that periodic review, reexamination and recalibration are healthy and constructive in a self-governing society, and by bending over backwards to embrace reforms that will help restore the public\u0027s trust.Comments (12)Avidan MilevskyProfessor of Psychology, Therapist, Author, Parenting media expertFinally, kick off your resolution with a bang. Often, resolutions begin and end with an idea. The goal is to launch the idea into action.CommentsRep. Debbie Wasserman SchultzAuthor, \u0027For the Next Generation\u0027; Chair, Democratic National CommitteeThe Republican party\u0027s government shutdown that lasted 16 days and cost the economy $24 billion offered a clear illustration of the dysfunction in Washington. But it doesn\u0027t have to be that way.Comments (127)Leigh WeingusAssistant Editor, HuffPost TVWhat did I want for myself in 2013? My mind drifted to yoga. I had signed up for a teacher training program, so why not make this my Year Of Yoga by supplementing my training with additional classes? 200 seemed like a nice round number, and it\u0027s not like it would take over my life.CommentsJoseph ParkerAuthor and Digital Marketing ProfessionalThe temptation you may have to rob others may come to you suddenly this year given the state of things, but I urge you to avoid it. Working provides you with a cerebral sense of satisfaction that goes beyond the simple collection of a paycheck. Also, robbery is a felony.CommentsDavid RockDirector, NeuroLeadership InstituteIn 2013, we continued to push the boundaries of what we know about ourselves; going boldly into questions no researcher has gone before. Like, what should we do when we need a little lift -- take a run, have a coffee, or grab a beer?CommentsBetsy Brown BraunChild development and behavior specialist, author, wife, mom, granny and friendLet\u0027s talk about resolving to make some changes in your parenting -- small adjustments that you can do and keep up, that will make a big difference in your life with your child.CommentsMatthew HutsonScience writer; author, \u0027The 7 Laws of Magical Thinking\u0027The running joke about New Year\u0027s resolutions is that they don\u0027t outlast the hangover. But if you\u0027re going to make a resolution to improve yourself, New Year\u0027s Eve is a good time to do it. Recent research helps explains why we pick this date for personal renovation.CommentsClaire FallonManaging Blog Editor, The Huffington PostMy real resolution, however, involves a different kind of muscle -- one that\u0027s been atrophying in recent years. Yes, it\u0027s my brain, which needs to be strengthened with a healthy reading regimen.Comments (11)Mark RadcliffeWriter and singer/songwriterDear Ladies Who Are On The Fence About Whether Or Not to Dump The Guy Who\u0027s Taking You For Granted: Here\u0027s what you should be hearing from the guy who\u0027s worthy of your time.Comments (32)Devon CornealMother, writer, lawyerHe\u0027s so innocent and I\u0027m so jaded and I want to preserve this curiosity and openness forever, but I can\u0027t. He thinks I know the answers.CommentsDean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Last week former New York Times editor Bill Keller had a column that distinguished the \"left-left\" and the center-left. However, what\u0027s more important than the labeling is the main line of distinction Keller tries to draw.Comments (68)Debbi DickinsonEntrepreneurWhat I realized is that my resolutions were focused more around what I should NOT be doing versus who I SHOULD strive to be. I usually found that by the second or third week of January, I had reverted back to my old habits and my resolutions were forgotten or at least ignored.CommentsGeorge HalvorsonFormer Chairman and CEO, Kaiser PermanenteThirty minutes a day of reading can determine whether or not a child can read or not read -- and that interaction can determine whether a child will stay in school or not stay in school.CommentsAmy ChanRelationship \u0026 lifestyle columnist, founder of www.JustMyType.caThis year, instead of creating a new set of goals and resolutions, I\u0027ve decided to create a contract. This is a contract with myself, on the everyday behaviors and perspectives I can incorporate so I can grow -- so that I can be the best version of \"me,\" that I can be.Comments (32)V-DayA global activist movement to end violence against women and girlsI saw, like a picture, every step of our 13-year journey in their fierceness, in their courage, in their generosity and love of our women and our country -- as well as in their joy and insistence on hope.CommentsDavid Katz, M.D.Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterResolutions, born of a \"ready or not, let\u0027s go\" mentality, invite failure. So reinvent your resolutions and make them more likely to succeed. Resolve to get ready, and go only when you are.CommentsJeffrey BuchananSenior Domestic Policy Advisor, Oxfam AmericaMuch ink is spilt in end-of-year recaps this time of year, but the most compelling national analysis so far came from Joan Walsh of Salon. She proclaimed 2013 as the year \"Americans discovered the crisis of the working poor.\" But unfortunately Congress still hasn\u0027t discovered it.Comments (11)Jacob GoldING retirement coach and authorMany people shy away from New Year\u0027s resolutions, but setting concrete goals for 2014 can be the start of making some truly positive changes in your life.CommentsRachelle FriedmanBlogger; speaker; ambassador for the spinal cord injury communityI really don\u0027t mean for this to be a guilt trip, but more of a swift kick in the rear to get you moving! I learned a very hard lesson at a young age and hindsight truly is 20/20.CommentsRalph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorYears ago books mattered more in provoking change. It is up to readers today not to be overwhelmed by information overload, to be selective and make books matter again.CommentsDavid Wallechinsky, 2014. 1.01Stephanie Vanderslice, 2014. 1.01Emma Tattenbaum-Fine, 2014. 1.01Steve Rosenbaum, 2014. 1.01Joseph Parker, 2014. 1.01Jeff Danziger, 2014. 1.01Vana Dabney, 2014. 1.01Alia Al-Ali, 2014. 1.01Andrew Wang, 2014. 1.01David Finkle, 2014. 1.01Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"COLORADO LIGHTS UP THE NEW YEAR",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BizYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
