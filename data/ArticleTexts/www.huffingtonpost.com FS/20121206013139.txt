{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Health policy consultantI don\u0027t know about you but I\u0027m getting really tired of the hysteria over this so-called, somewhat media created, \"fiscal cliff\" thing. The White House called the Republicans\u0027 latest proposal \"fairy dust.\" But I do think we are in for some changes in health care as a result of the discussions going on in Washington, D.C., so I thought you should know what to expect. First, try to ignore the hysteria. Whatever laws will expire December 31, there will be a solution and at some point we will need to restructure and reform some of our government programs. Which ones? Probably Medicare. Maybe Medicaid. And at some point, although certainly not urgent now -- Social Security. The Republicans want you to think that without \"entitlement reform,\" we cannot reach a deal on the so-called fiscal cliff. But step back for a moment.Read Post | Comments (150)Michael Shaw, 12/05/12Publisher of BagNewsNotes, topping LIFE.com\u0027s 2011 Best Photo BlogsBeyond the pitched cries of editorial impropriety, perhaps it\u0027s not all clear what the subway photo is really about.

Al Sharpton, 12/05/12President, National Action NetworkWhen the top 2 percent were enjoying tax breaks and stockpiling prosperity, there was no sharing. Now they have the audacity to ask seniors, minorities, folks whose children fought in our wars, the disenfranchised and the most vulnerable among us to sacrifice some more. Does that seem fair?Read Post | CommentsRebecca Hughes Parker, 12/05/12Attorney, Journalist, Editor of FCPA ReportTwins for Kate?
