Wolinsky, 9/26/11Media consultant, former managing editor of the Los Angeles TimesThe premiere of \"Pan Am\" and the audio interview with Jacqueline Kennedy were both reminders of a bygone era during which graciousness and manners were prized above today\u0027s values of raw candor and self-absorption.Read Post | CommentsMohamed A. El-Erian, 9/25/11CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOWhether they like it or not -- and they do not like it -- the global economy and markets will remain in the backseat of a car being driven very erratically by policymakers in Europe and in the US who continue to dither.Read Post | Comments (151)Andy Ostroy, 9/26/11Political \u0026 pop culture analystWith Tea Party royalty fighting to stay alive, does that make the landscape deliciously ripe for the Queen herself, Sarah Palin, to enter the race?Read Post | Comments (146)Dennis A. Henigan, 9/26/11Acting President, Brady Campaign; Author, \u0027Lethal Logic\u0027It\u0027s no secret that Republican Presidential candidate Rick Perry likes guns.

Acker, 9/26/11Attorney, Legal and Political AnalystThe issue of Murray\u0027s guilt or innocence will turn on a few discrete questions: Did the doctor fail to perform a legal duty that he owed to Michael Jackson?
