{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AriannaI just landed at Vail airport, right next to the Vice President’s Gulfstream jet (actually, there were two Vice Presidential planes, not one... how much of an entourage does one VP need?). He’s here to speak at the World Forum at Beaver Creek, sponsored by the American Enterprise Institute, and held, of course, behind closed doors. The guy sent to pick me up by the Vail Valley Institute (where I’m speaking) told me that he had seen the VP’s motorcade speed towards the local hospital. Being an intrepid HuffPost reporter, I asked him to take me straight there. Upon our arrival, we encountered a high level of security -- and a lot of zipped lips: “We cannot tell you anything,” “No comment,” “That information is not available...” But one hospital staffer, obviously not schooled in the secretive ways of Cheney, let it slip: “He’s no longer here”. And since you cannot “no longer” be someplace you’ve never been, we can deduce -- though not confirm -- that Cheney did, in fact, pay a visit to the local hospital. The reason? Over to you AP...06.24.2005 Sen. Evan BayhSometimes when I come back to Washington from Indiana, I feel like an ambassador to a foreign country. The reality of the Bush administration and the reality of people around the country seem to be two very different propositions. Take the debate over energy in Washington. It doesn’t take a degree in economics to know that something is wrong when it takes $30 or $40 to fill up the gas tank. And we don’t need some Washington think tank to tell us that it’s a problem when so much of our economic and national security depends on whether Saudi Arabia and Russia are in the mood to be nice to us on any given day.read whole post | permalink | comments06.24.2005 Trey EllisKarl Rove won’t apologize and those that love the administration now will only love it more after this dust up settles. \"I think Karl was very specific, very accurate, in who he was pointing out,\" communications director Dan Bartlett said. \"It\u0027s touched a chord with these Democrats. I\u0027m not sure why.\" See how Dan Barlett masterfully spins from defense to offense by saying, “I’m not sure why”? He leaves hanging in the air the implicit answer, “Because Democrats are girly-men metrosexuals, quick to cry and woefully unprepared to protect this nation against those that mean us harm.”read whole post | permalink | comments06.24.2005 Janet GrilloLast night I did something highly unusual for a parent of a child with Autism...I left the house before my son was asleep. I went out to dinner with the parent of another Autistic boy. We swapped war stories...his son ran out of the car in the middle of Wilshire Blvd, my son insisted he could fly and tried to jump off a two story balcony, his son has held up a butcher knife and tried to attack him with it when in the midst of a raging tantrum more times than he can remember, my son has only done this once. My son called my celphone no less than 8 times during the hour I was away, spinning in a vortex of anxiety, desperate for me to return. He is eleven years old. And he is doing remarkably well.read whole post | permalink | comments06.24.2005 David CornSo Rove, who works for a guy who says he wants to be a uniter-not-a-divider, accuses liberals of not wanting to defend their country, and the Bushies proclaim, \"Well done!\" Could it be that Bush was not serious when he spoke of his heartfelt desire to heal and unite this nation? Unless he meant, \"I will be a uniter but I will happily employ those who traffic in the most divisive politics possible.\"read whole post | permalink | comments06.24.2005 Peter LaarmanIt’s hard to choose the nastiest among the many nastier aspects of a June 22 House vote against flag “desecration.” As a minister, I am interested in that word desecration because I cannot recall when the American flag was first made into a holy or sacred object -— when it was sanctified.read whole post | permalink | comments06.24.2005 Erica JongI was once the wife of a psychiatrist drafted into the US Army during the Viet Nam War. I know that there’s always the right way and the Army way. The Viet Nam war caused army doctors to learn special skills—like counseling victims of Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome or counseling the children of personnel who were traumatized or helping adolescents to deal with the distress of moving every two years when their parents were transferred. . . But never in my three years as a medical officer’s wife did I hear of trained specialists assisting torturers.read whole post | permalink | comments06.24.2005 Gara LaMarcheThe British have quaint, innocuous-seeming euphemisms for everything, and the growing reliance on \"quality of life\" laws -- calling to mind Rudy Giuliani\u0027s crackdown on squeegee men and other menaces to society -- is here called \"Asbo\", for Anti-Social Behavior Ordinances. You won\u0027t be surprised, given the history of such laws in the U.S., especially city curfews, that non-white kids are most affected.read whole post | permalink | comments06.24.2005 Paul RieckhoffWith all the munitions scattered across Iraq, RPGs and artillery shells are practically household items. And they continue to make IEDs (Imporvised Explosive Devices/ roadside bombs) from just about everything. What does this mean? It means the enemy threat is evolving. As I saw in Iraq when I was there, the insurgents are smart. And are clearly getting smarter.read whole post | permalink | comments06.23.2005 Kristen BreitweiserNow Karl, a question for you, since you seem to be the nation\u0027s self-styled sensei with regard to 9/11: Is Usama Bin Laden still important? Lately, your coterie of friends seems to be giving out mixed messages. Recall that in the early days, Bin Laden was wanted “dead or alive.” I mention Bin Laden because recently Director of the CIA, Porter Goss, has mentioned that he knows exactly where Bin Laden is located but that he cannot capture him for fear of offending sovereign nations. Which frankly, I find ironic because of Iraq--and let\u0027s just leave it at that.read whole post | permalink | comments06.23.2005 Bill DiamondWhile conservatives saw “the savagery of 9/11 and the attacks and prepared for war”, what were we doing? Sitting on our huge, tax-lovin\u0027 asses, doing nothing but coming up with ways to provide “therapy and understanding” for the September 11 attacks. How else do you explain that while Republicans were taking care of business, the only response by congressional Democrats was to propose the “Jihadist Bed and Breakfast Discount Act of 2002”? Or the “What Do You Say We Don’t Inspect All Cargo Containers” rider to last year’s farm bill?read whole post | permalink | comments06.23.2005 Hooman MajdIn Senate hearings on Thursday, Donald Rumsfeld maintained the administration’s delusional stance on Iraq by stating that the U.S. is not losing the war. Notably, he didn’t say that we’re winning either, rather, he used the word “success” in the context of what to expect from our adventure in Mesopotamia. Success? What does that mean? Is it something like Nixon’s “peace with honor”, which means we’ll retreat one day, helicopters shuttling between Green Zone rooftops and aircraft carriers in the Persian Gulf?read whole post | permalink | comments06.23.2005 Marty KaplanThis week the Pentagon began working with a private company called BeNow to create a marketing database of Americans 16- to 18- years old. According to the Washington Post, the product being marketed to these kids, you will not be shocked to learn, is enlistment in the military. So just as Amazon.com can send you an email saying that you might want to buy the new Anne Coulter book because you bought Mussolini’s memoirs in the past, now the Pentagon can pick off kids whose grades aren’t scholarship material ... and paint a rosy picture of their future in uniform.read whole post | permalink | comments06.24.2005 Robin BronkFreedom of Artistic Expression is currently under attack in Congress under the terms of the \"Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act.\" Although termed \"performer fines,\" these penalties would apply not just to high-profile entertainers like Janet Jackson, Howard Stern or Bono, but to any American citizen. Thus, anyone who speaks their mind over the public airwaves -- man on the street interviewees, radio call-in listeners, newscasters, athletes, even politicians -- could face financial ruin for an unintentional slip of the tongue.read whole post | permalink | comments06.23.2005 Nellie BPharmacists are denying patients needed pain relief and mental-health medication prescribed by their doctors? And nobody is covering this? Well, NPR did have a brief item, but I\u0027ve been unable to find any followup coverage on either the veracity or the depth of the problem. Sure, chronic pain is significantly less sexy than contraception -- or tanning beds and video games, for that matter -- but it might actually be a little bit newsworthy.

No more needs to be said about the motives of liberals.\" Yes, the executives at Al Jazeera, having no visuals or video of torture or civilian casualties, were pacing the office while feverishly checking their C-Span feed for something, anything to incite the Muslim world.
