{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week, the House voted along party lines to open yet another Benghazi investigation -- adding to the 13 hearings and 50 briefings already completed. Democrats, who are considering boycotting the hearings, should instead hold alternate hearings on all the real and ongoing problems being ignored, like income inequality, gun deaths (approximately more than 40,000 since Benghazi), and climate change. On Tuesday, climate change was the subject of a very different kind of investigation. The National Climate Assessment -- an 800-page report from 300 scientists -- warned that climate change is already here. \"The question,\" said one lead scientist, \"is are we able to meet the challenges, given the growing understanding of how much the climate could change this century?\" Unfortunately, the answer for the GOP seems to be: \"Benghazi.\" On an utterly non-partisan note: here\u0027s wishing moms everywhere a very happy Mother\u0027s Day!The most recent findings from the U.S. Department of Education\u0027s Civil Rights Data Collection, called the \"richest, fullest\" collection so far for measuring education access and equity in our nation\u0027s public schools, show many children are still receiving an unequal education. This is the unfinished work of the Civil Rights Movement.Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe situation in Nigeria has focused us on the plight of these abducted girls, but were we blind before to this possibility? It always takes a current event to snap us out of our collective fog, to clear away the cobwebs of our own inaction and make us take notice. What can we do to help them and to make our Mother\u0027s Day mean a little more?Jamie Lee CurtisActress and children\u0027s book authorSunday is Mother\u0027s Day, and there\u0027s no better time to join the movement to improve the health and well-being of mothers and babies everywhere. That\u0027s the goal of the Global Moms Relay. In partnership with the UN Foundation, Johnson \u0026 Johnson and BabyCenter, HuffPost is putting the spotlight on the ways we can bring new opportunities to women and children around the world.Arianna HuffingtonIf you live nearby, a visit never fails. My favorite mothers\u0027 days have been the ones I\u0027ve spent at home and that feel like any other lazy Sunday morning, but with my kids and my husband and all three dogs lazing around with me.Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarToday, the country is at a tipping point. The most recent events in Bor and Bentiu are alarming. They bear all the troubling signs of a country drifting into a dangerous polarization of the conflict along ethnic lines which is about to spin out of control.Sean PennHilde JohnsonWe can only get married because millions of people took a stand to defend and protect us. The gay people of Brunei -- and Russia, and Uganda, and many other countries -- need us to take another stand today.Elton JohnDavid FurnishI am constantly asking myself \"What would my mother do?\" when situations and questions like these arise. The only difference is what happens after I answer that question: I do the opposite.Jamie KrugWriter, SAHM, CMO - Chief Medical Officer (of my family), Wife, Blogger at Our Stroke of LuckIt took three weeks for President Obama to publicly address the crisis of over 250 Nigerian school girls kidnapped on April 14, and to pledge to send modest support. That is 22 days of unfathomable cruelty to vulnerable girls.Dambisa MoyoAuthor, \u0027Dead Aid: Why Aid is Not Working and How There is a Better Way for Africa\u0027On Friday we learned that a lot of Republican U.S. senators and a smattering of Democrats are once again trying to make an end run around a legitimate process to assess the impacts of the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline.Robert RedfordActor, director and environmental activistIn the future foretold by French economist Thomas Piketty, the rich will keep getting richer by doing basically nothing, living off the income generated by their already massive wealth. For many hedge-fund managers, that future is now.Mark GongloffChief financial writer, The Huffington PostWhen Pensacola, Florida, gets two feet of rain in 26 hours, that is exactly the kind of extreme and destructive event that scientists have long warned will become way more common.Al GoreChairman, Generation Investment Management and The Climate Reality ProjectAs children, we often strive for separation and differentiation from our parents, perhaps our mothers in particular. For many of us, our mothers were the mainstay in our childhood lives, the very epitome of regularity and the ordinary. But we don\u0027t want ordinary; we want extraordinary.Christine OrganAuthor; Freelance Writer; BloggerDuring the Cold War and the war on terrorism, expediency too often trumped principle. That is what makes our foreign policy weak, not the failure to use military force. The best way to strengthen our foreign policy is to rebuild our nation and revitalize our economy at home and make that our beacon to the world.Gary HartUnited States Senator (Ret.)In commemoration of our ninth birthday, here\u0027s a look back at nine memorable blog posts since 2005 -- one from each year.The Huffington Post BlogBarack Obama told us there would be no compromise on net neutrality. We heard him say it back in 2007, when he first was running for president. He said it many more times. And defenders of net neutrality believed him.Bill MoyersMichael WinshipSimple question. Are you Nigerian? If not, I have news you. You can\u0027t do anything about the girls missing in Nigeria. You can\u0027t. Your insistence on urging American power, specifically American military power, to address this issue will ultimately hurt the people of Nigeria.Jumoke BalogunCo-Founder of CompareAfrique.comInstead of looking in the mirror, our politicians blame the schools. They say that we lost those jobs because our schools were preparing students poorly, not because the \"job creators\" wanted to export jobs to countries that pay their workers a few dollars a day.Diane RavitchResearch Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027The name of Washington, D.C.\u0027s football team is a racial slur, a racist epithet. The U.S. trademark office agrees; so does the dictionary. But more importantly, Native American people feel it. How important is that to the rest of us? That is the moral question for all of us: Are we going to show respect for our nation\u0027s original citizens?Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersHis school will receive a zero for my opting him out, which will lower his school\u0027s proficiency standings. On one hand, I feel bad that his school is being punished for my decision. But it is not me who is punishing the school: Our government is punishing them.Pauline HawkinsEnglish teacherRewarding Brunei, the first East Asian nation to follow in the footsteps of Taliban-era Afghanistan by stoning gays to death, will send a grotesque message to the world.Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesMotherhood. It\u0027s something I think about often, tracing my fingers around its fuzzy edges, trying to make sense of it with with words, trying to get it right. But I fail and fail again.Aidan Donnelley RowleyAuthor, \u0027Life After Yes\u0027I\u0027m learning that person who was under the cloud of constant alcohol blackouts for the last several years was not me. I am not the stupid, embarrassing things I did; I am a real person who does not mix well with alcohol.Kelly FitzgeraldSocial media manager and bloggerFor many of us, mom was our first teacher. She taught us to recite the alphabet, how to tie our shoes, to swim and not to hit our siblings. This year, we honor moms and their wisdom by sharing the lessons learned from mom by some of our nation\u0027s most accomplished people.Kristin Rowe-FinkbeinerExecutive Director/CEO and Co-Founder of MomsRising.orgI spent MANY years hating and hiding a body I was ashamed of because it wasn\u0027t society\u0027s ideal of beautiful. Being asked to send a photo of myself with a shirt on made me feel like I again should be ashamed of my body.Brooke BirminghamHealthy lifestyle bloggerLike all moms, my mother gave me some wonderful pieces advice over the years, the most valuable being her encouragement to follow my own course and seize the career I wanted. She\u0027d left her singing behind when she\u0027d decided to marry and raise a family; and so I think she poured much of that passion into ensuring that my sister and brother and I never lost sight of our own dreams. I\u0027ve never forgotten that about my mom -- and so this year, I thought I\u0027d turn the tables around and ask you: What piece of advice did your mother give you that has had a lasting impact?Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistThere\u0027s no legal limit to what you can be paid as the charter school operator. The only limits to your salary are the limits set by your own sense of shame. If you have no shame, then ka-ching, my friend. Ka. Ching.Peter GreeneTeacher, writerUntil we have a full-proof justice system that treats everyone equally under the law, we cannot falsely believe that everyone executed is in fact guilty. The process itself is cruel and in one of the most modern countries on the planet, there is simply no place for it.Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkIs thinking positive and cultivating a happy and balanced outlook important to people with cancer? Absolutely. Is telling someone else to think positive even the slightest bit helpful? Not at all. And don\u0027t get me started on The Secret.Dr. Nikhil JoshiPhysician, speaker and author of \u0027The End of Suffering\u0027Can\u0027t we please at least get to see one Puerto Rican (or any other Latino character for that matter) portrayed as an actual New York City human being?Michele Carlowriter/performerThe average net worth of the 41 GOP senators who opposed the first minimum wage increase in half a decade is $6.26 million.Leo W.
