{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranThe president was correct in announcing humanitarian action yesterday in Iraq. He will be helping to prevent genocide. But, more than that, his announcement of limited military action, both to overtly protect US troops and installations, and tacitly support the Kurds in their fight against the Islamic State, is the correct move. In fact, today\u0027s air strikes against Islamic State forces outside Irbil serves two purposes. First, it protect U.S. interests in a city we cannot afford to lose, lest we see another Benghazi-type situation there. Second, it help the Kurds, our best ally in the region, in their efforts to prevent genocide. This kind of action is the right call.Magician and New York Times crossword puzzle wizard David Kwong says we\u0027re wired to solve puzzles and make order out of chaos -- and he\u0027s got a trick to prove it.\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"Every time the president -- this president or any president -- is allowed to \"cut corners\" on the Constitutional question of Congressional war powers, it sets a bad precedent for the future, eroding a key Constitutional, democratic speed bump against unnecessary wars of choice.Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicyIt has been widely reported that August 9 marks the 40th anniversary of President Nixon\u0027s resignation. What has received considerably less attention is that the date also marks the 30th anniversary of the publication of what may well be the stupidest thing ever written about Watergate: an op-ed column for The Washington Post by one Benjamin J. Stein.The 25th anniversary edition of Paul Slansky\u0027s The Clothes Have No Emperor will be published this fall.I asked Jeremy Courtney for his opinion on what Christians might be able to do to help Christians on the ground in Iraq, and his answer surprised me and might surprise Christians and non-Christians alike.Executive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostI have been a vocal opponent of that war since George W. Bush proposed the invasion in 2002. I strongly believe that the actions President Obama announced in Iraq last night deserve progressive support.Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersPlease, for the love of all that\u0027s good and holy, stop the nonsense. We\u0027ve overcome this problem before and we can do it again. Remember saying things were \"radical\" or \"rad\"?Blogger, \"Hot Flashes of Inspiration\"You need to say thank you. It can be a tiring place, this happily ever after. Yes, there is love and there are kitchen dances and sweet cream baby cheeks. But there are also sleepless nights and mortgages and post baby stretch marks.WriterISIS has attacked the Yazidi people -- a sect of the Kurds -- in Iraq. The jihadists have driven the survivors to the slopes of Mt. Sinjar, where the Yazidi are running out of food, water and hope. Who are the Yazidi?

This is when, with a bit of work, they can make peace with their partners, recall shared history, experience love in a new way and make relevant how it relates to the parts of their lives that they actively care about.Founder and Chairman: The Second Half Foundation and Centre; Author, The Second Half of Your LifeToday, we don\u0027t blink an eye when the world\u0027s wealthiest individuals donate enormous sums of money to charitable causes. In fact, we expect them to do so. But large-scale philanthropy hasn\u0027t always been a part of history.Chairman/CEO, XPRIZEThis crisis needs a compassionate response from every city and our entire nation. I shudder when I see the angry outbursts about these helpless children coming from some communities.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundThis conflict has devastated the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians, and readers of the Times require clear and accurate comparisons of data.Advocacy Director for Middle East North Africa issues at Amnesty International USA.Women are the ones who have elective abortions, and women (mostly) get breast cancer, so therefore, abortion causes breast cancer? Come on, let\u0027s be better than this -- correlation does not equal causation.Blogger, breast cancer survivorThis situation is unlike previous rounds of fighting between Israel and Hamas for the very reason that Israel has found a partner so zealous in Egypt that it can afford to ignore signals from Washington urging restraint.Editor, Middle East Eye\u0027ve been \"prowlin\u0027 and a growlin\u0027\" for 70 years now and sometimes you forget to take stock of the world around you. It\u0027s easy to think that what\u0027s here now will be here tomorrow, but it doesn\u0027t just happen. It takes you. Only you.Only you can prevent wildfiresCREDO commends President Obama for responding to a clear humanitarian crisis with emergency supplies. More is needed, the U.S. need not continue alone, but starting quickly while refugees are literally dying on the mountain is the right thing to do now.President, CREDO MobileI disagree with those who suggest that Netanyahu will never change his stripes. Many deeply ideological leaders before him have unexpectedly risen to the occasion to answer the call from their people and the international community for a drastic change.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUIf you go to the time and trouble of curing and smoking your own bacon, start by procuring a pork belly worthy of your efforts. This means from organic hogs (or hogs raised humanely without hormones or antibiotics).Grilling Authority, www.barbecuebible.comHe cynically fanned racism, manipulated white voters and prepared the ground for the conservative assault on civil rights, affirmative action and social programs that, in the years after his plunge to disgrace, the GOP has honed to a fine art.Author and political analystThere are hundreds of cases in West Africa and now a new cluster of cases in Nigeria is very concerning. The spread of Ebola shows what happens if we don\u0027t have meticulous infection control, contact tracing, and proper isolation of those with symptoms of the disease.Director, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)President Obama\u0027s announcement that the US will protect 40,000 Yazidis trapped on Iraq\u0027s Sinjar Mountain is a decisive response to an unfolding humanitarian disaster. Airdrops of water and food will save lives. The Yazidis, however, will not really be safe until they can get off the desert mountain and back to their homes in Sinjar.Former U.S. Ambassador to CroatiaI wonder what my 20s would have been like if I had learned to meditate sooner. I wonder if my health would have been different or if I would have been able to handle it all better. Or if maybe all of this was part of a grand order of things. I have room in my life now where I didn\u0027t before.Senior Editor, HuffPost LAThere are still moments of sadness, moments when I yearn for the physical presence of my daughter.
