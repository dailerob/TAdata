{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Fellow, DemosIntellectual consistency has never been an attribute of American politics. Life is complicated, and voters want different things at different times. But real social progress is a function of ideas and leaders who stick by them. Occasionally, the genuine libertarian impulse of some Republicans rears up and undoes conventional alliances. Rand Paul\u0027s insistence on undoing parts of the post 9/11 wiretapping laws has created a series of strange bedfellows, and opens an interesting door to further unusual coalitions. Where Republicans and Democrats can find compatible intellectual grounds, there are all kinds of possibilities. Let\u0027s pretend that the Rand Paul/Obama wiretap alliance becomes politically attractive in other areas. What would emerge?I think when tragedy occurs, it presents a choice. You can give in to the void, the emptiness that fills your heart, your lungs, constricts your ability to think or even breathe. Or you can try to find meaning.Chief Operating Officer, FacebookEx-lobbyist Tom Wheeler\u0027s courage in battling deep-pocketed corporations on competition, open Internet, privacy, the digital divide, and robocalls transformed him in my mind from oligarch apologist to American Avenger. That\u0027s why I\u0027m so bummed he won\u0027t use his superpowers to fight the super PACs.USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorBen Bronsther is a creator of Chrona, a memory-foam insert that goes inside your pillowcase and tracks your sleep based on the movements of your head and torso.

I am not prideful enough to assume that the same could not happen to me. It\u0027s not that teachers are looking for a reason to leave. America, we\u0027re looking for a reason to stay.Educator, speech and debate coach, writerI am a sister to a beautiful and kind young transgender woman.

But I have to ask you to do me a solid and make sure you don\u0027t ever come visit my high school. You see, Steph, if you come to my school you will be your usual inspiring, humble self and you will say all the right things. But the reason I don\u0027t want you to come has to do with what you won\u0027t say.Writer and high school English teach from the San Francisco Bay areaCapitalism is also hampered by its own inherent limitations as an economic system rooted in competition. Competition creates losers for winners; the true trickle-down effect that decades of data is now beginning to validate. Competition divides -- always.Humanitarian and Author of Awakening Leadership: Embracing Mindfulness, Your Life\u0027s Purpose, and the Leader You Were Born to BePart of what makes the piece so compelling is a series of storytelling devices and disclosures that also make it, frankly, irresponsible. What most people don\u0027t realize is that ESPN\u0027s coverage of Holleran\u0027s death could potentially harm vulnerable individuals.Healthy Living Editor, The Huffington PostSenior Lifestyle Blog Editor, The Huffington PostWalker was an ALEC member as a state legislator in the 1990s, and the agenda that Walker has championed throughout his long political career has closely tracked the policies promoted by ALEC and its corporate funders, despite public opposition to many of those measures.

This June, the Court will hand down decisions in a number of high-profile cases.Assistant Director at the Institute for JusticeIn the view of Margaret Heffernan, author of A Bigger Prize: Why Competition Isn\u0027t Everything, and How We Do Better, teaching competition from the earliest years produces adults who fail at creative thinking and generates a society where cheating is incentivized and people never learn to collaborate. In the following interview, she explains why this failure puts us all at risk.Author and cultural theoristKing v. Burwell and its potential aftermath represent the last stand for those looking to kill the ACA.

Most of the people inside are poor and Black. Here are 40 reasons why.Law Professor, Loyola University New Orleans, CCR Associate Legal DirectorThe two recent attacks on mosques in eastern Saudi Arabia can\u0027t be labeled as anything but evil acts of terrorism. Such a classification seems obvious to most of us; however, having just attended brain-storming sessions at the WEF summit, I fear there might be some confusion as to what is defined as terrorism and what isn\u0027t.Editor-in-Chief, Al Arabiya English; author of upcoming book on Arab mediaTo be fair, I\u0027d actually done it a few times in weeks prior and found it to be gentle and relaxing. But apparently, that was just the placebo effect because two hours into dinner, it kicked in. My temperature started rising and everyone in the room was suddenly out for my blood.

Blogger at Crash Test Parents and Racheltoalson.comNow, it\u0027s Bernie Sanders who is likely to be the only real progressive to be willing to take on Clinton, Inc. in the Democratic primary, although, unlike Warren, he has virtually no chance of defeating Clinton. No longer a threat to Hillary\u0027s candidacy, Warren\u0027s real-world influence will wane, and she\u0027ll be reduced to the Sanders role as the Senate gadfly.Entertainment attorney, writer and political activistBig sacrifices like the ones I made -- giving up a career and a fat paycheck of my own -- deserve a little extra recognition. Calling it a bonus and making it clear that it is mine further underscores my right to spend it as I see fit.Blogger, The Nomad Mom DiaryWhen I moved to the United States 10 years ago, I was adamant that I would eventually return to India. I had heard that I wouldn\u0027t. I refused to concede. But I have run out of excuses for my country.
