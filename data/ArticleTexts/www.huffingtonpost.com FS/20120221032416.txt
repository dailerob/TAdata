{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editorial Director, AOL Huffington Post Media GroupIn spite of the ever-deepening flood of candidate advertising, politics (and journalism) today are do-it-yourself, web-based and socially-connected enterprises. Which is where you come in. We want to find the best, most creative citizen journalists in America and Canada and send them, at our expense, to cover the conventions in their own way, with their own vision and their own ideas.

Daughters, Fathers, And The Changing American Family\u0027With mounting signs that the economy is getting some traction, boiling populist rage is dialing down to a grumbling simmer. This raises the possibility of the GOP nightmare scenario: voters going into the election in a reasonably upbeat mood.Read Post | Comments (31)Marlo Thomas, 2/20/12Award-winning actress, author, and activistFor many of us, Presidents Day means an extra day off work and the chance to hit up the holiday sales. But, as we recall from our school days, it\u0027s actually more than that.Read Post | Comments (76)Jared Bernstein, 2/20/12Senior Fellow, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesFor many years, policy makers and public officials have argued about whether public policy should help promote American manufacturing or whether we should leave it alone and let the market do what it will. As usual, such stark positions have little to do with reality.Read Post | Comments (95)Ellen DeGeneres, 2/20/12Host, \u0027The Ellen DeGeneres Show\u0027I think everyone should see at least one independent film a year. It\u0027s a great way to experience something different, and you get to wear a beret. Who knows? Maybe you\u0027ll wind up seeing your favorite film of the year.Read Post | Comments (47)Leo W. Gerard, 2/20/12International President, United SteelworkersIn a presidential election year, Boehner \u0026 Co. surrendered to a simple calculus: the 99 percent has something that the 1 percent doesn\u0027t -- more votes. Way more.Read Post | Comments (218)Annie McKee, 2/19/12Bestselling author, leadership advisor, cofounder of Teleos Leadership InstituteLearning to live mindfully and to focus on hope and compassion will help you to ward off stress and balance yourself.Read Post | Comments (45)Paul Brandeis Raushenbush, 2/18/12Senior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostMr. Santorum should be careful in his efforts to score political points using biblical mandates on the same week that he shows such callousness towards the lives of the poor.Read Post | Comments (1,599)Mache Seibel, MD, 2/20/12Professor, UMass Medical School; Co-author, Save Your Life: What to Do In A Medical EmergencyThe U.S. Attorney General recently announced a revised definition of rape so that it can be more accurately reported and prosecuted.

This is especially striking in light of the fact that Lincoln presided over a period more challenging and economically destructive than any other in America\u0027s history.Read Post | CommentsIan Fletcher, 2/20/12Author, \u0027Free Trade Doesn\u0027t Work: What Should Replace It and Why\u0027Ron Paul, even among his detractors, enjoys a reputation as a man of clear principle. But the more I study his positions on free trade, the more the one word that comes to mind is... disingenuous.Read Post | Comments (175)Robert Kuttner, 2/19/12Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027A secretive independent party financed by hedge fund and private equity plutocrats is not only a blight on the democratic process. It could end up being a dangerous wild card in a momentous election.Read Post | Comments (644)Jacob Brunette, 2/20/12High school sophomore in WashingtonAs the situation stands now, Santorum has presented the first real threat to Romney\u0027s campaign. Whether or not he succeeds in the end, the primaries have just gotten a lot more interesting.Read Post | CommentsAlan Grayson, 2/20/12Former U.S. Congressman from Florida\u0027s 8th DistrictToday is Presidents Day. That makes it a good time to talk about one of the great anomalies in presidential history: Abraham Lincoln\u0027s mercy.Read Post | Comments (22)Elena Brower, 2/20/12Founder, co-owner of Virayoga, Art of AttentionI love the methodology of Anusara yoga.

There are a couple of major reasons this is especially important.Read Post | Comments (22)Alan Schroeder, 2/19/12Professor, School of Journalism, Northeastern UniversityAfter nearly a month-long hiatus, the reality television series known as the GOP presidential primary debates returns to the small screen on Wednesday.

Learsy, 2/20/12Author, \u0027Oil and Finance: The Epic Corruption\u0027The tumult and fabricated anxieties over Iran\u0027s oil supply give ample cover to an oil price veering ever higher -- prices explained away by the political tensions at hand.
