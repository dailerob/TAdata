{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"In his otherwise excellent speech on Wednesday, the president showed that, when it comes to the plight of the middle class, he still doesn\u0027t get it. \"Not everything we\u0027ve done over the last two years has worked as quickly as we had hoped,\" he said, \"and I am keenly aware that not all our policies have been popular.\" But the problem isn\u0027t that his economic policies have been slow to succeed or unpopular -- it\u0027s that they\u0027ve been inadequate given the magnitude of the crisis. And, in his sit-down with George Stephanopoulos, he insisted that his administration has made \"the right decisions to move this country forward after a very devastating recession.\" Can he really believe that, with unemployment at 9.6 percent, millions of homes foreclosed, and the middle class under assault? In any case, this appears to be the administration\u0027s story, and they are sticking to it -- come hell or a double-dip recession.Read Post | CommentsJoseph A.
