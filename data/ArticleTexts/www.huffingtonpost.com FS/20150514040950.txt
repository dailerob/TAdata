{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Policy Director, National Iranian American CouncilPresident, National Iranian American CouncilThis summer, the U.S. Senate will choose between war and peace with Iran. If the right decision is made, Obama\u0027s pending nuclear deal with Iran will be sustained and both a war and an Iranian nuclear bomb will be avoided. If the wrong vote is cast, diplomacy will collapse and the U.S. and Iran will once again be on a path towards a disastrous war that will make the Iraq war look like the cake-walk it was promised to be. The good news is: If Americans speak up in large numbers, the Senate will choose peace.Joan C.

The Amtrak crash that took at least six lives last night makes it more obvious than ever that we need them now.Chairman Emeritus, Young \u0026 Rubicam; Author, \u0027The Constant Choice\u0027I was recently told by a guy that he didn\u0027t think it was a good idea for us to continue dating because I was \"too career-oriented.\" [Insert the deer in headlights, eyes bulging emoji].Avid learner, finance writer www.theFinancegirl.comThe greatest gains we can achieve in the next 10 years in public mental health will derive from closing the gap between what we know and what we do in both mental health and the addictions.Medical editor, mental health for The Huffington PostGilberto Valle typed many things into his Google search bar.
