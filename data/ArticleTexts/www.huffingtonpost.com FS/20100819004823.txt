{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"I get that the progressives, and the activists, and the young people who voted for the first time, and the disillusioned voters who returned to the polls in \u002708, feel slighted by the president. You thought you had a special connection with him, but it turns out he\u0027d rather hang out with Larry Summers, flirt with Olympia Snowe, or play war games late into the night with David Petraeus. Face it: he just isn\u0027t that into you. But, in the end, it doesn\u0027t matter where the president\u0027s heart is -- it matters what he does. LBJ wasn\u0027t that into the National Voting Rights Act until Martin Luther King and the Selma march pushed him into it. If Obama is going to do the right thing for America\u0027s middle class, it\u0027s going to take Hope 2.0 -- the people have to make him do it.Read Post | CommentsRobert Reich, 08.18.2010Former Secretary of Labor, Professor at BerkeleyMitt Romney is the most credible of all the likely Republican presidential candidates.

NBC\u0027s David Gregory failed to sufficiently challenge Petraeus on his easily disproved spin. CBS\u0027 Katie Couric is next at bat.Read Post | CommentsTony Blankley, 08.18.2010Syndicated columnistThe Democrats seem to be quite sure that Nancy Pelosi\u0027s approach to leadership will appeal to the common man and woman of 2010.
