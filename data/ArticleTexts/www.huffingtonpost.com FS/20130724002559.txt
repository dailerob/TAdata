{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jason Linkins and Sam WilkesA historic uprising yesterday in the birth canal of Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, has apparently ended in the successful birth of a presumably human child who shall one day rule over the United Kingdom with a glittery scepter and an army of swans. And your cable teevee news was ON IT, with Cable Ace Award nominated shots of building facades, intense speculation into the gender of the child, and lots of deep reporting on birthing chairs. On-air pundits were overjoyed that Middleton was able to produce male offspring, because they are the historically preferred option, and True Royals are supposed to have ways of shutting that whole giving-birth-to-a-girl thing down. Now Middleton shall be celebrated rightly as her kingdom\u0027s brood-mare and not get drowned in the Thames for witchcraft.Comments (49)Catherine WileyAssistant Professor of English, Temple UniversityI was introduced to the concept of white privilege in 1984, when I was 19, in college. I was having lunch with my first love, a black man, in a diner in central Ohio.Comments (2,507)Lloyd A. TreinishChief Scientist, Deep Thunder, IBM ResearchHow many mouths will the world be feeding by 2050? It is an estimated 9.2 billion, up from 7 billion today. To keep pace with this growing population, global food production will need to increase by 70 percent. That means getting a lot smarter about how we raise crops.CommentsMatthew ChapmanWriter/director, \"The Ledge\", author \"Trials Of The Monkey\"How tragic to watch Aaron Sorkin\u0027s brilliant, complex, committed \"Newsroom\" on HBO and then turn on CNN the next day and watch endless, spectacularly uninteresting coverage of the birth of a child to an uninteresting couple in England while the rest of the world burned.Comments (237)Jonathan RomainRabbi and writerIt is astonishing how many people do not know what their name means. It is not because they lack intelligence, but because English is a language with so many foreign roots that we have often lost touch with the origins of words.Comments (101)Courtney HardyAccount Executive at FOX40My sophomore biology class was studying genetics when I learned, by accident, that I was adopted. As my teacher explained that two blue-eyed parents would never have a brown-eyed child. I raised my hand, happy to be the exception.Comments (232)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027It is bizarre that Summers would be seriously considered as the next Fed chair. Memories tend to be short in Washington, but those of us removed from elite circles know that Summers\u0027 policies played a central role in setting up the economy for the crash.Comments (210)Tammy Nelson, Ph.D.Sex and relationship expert; Psychotherapist; Author of The New Monogamy and Getting the Sex You Want; International speakerOnce you cross the line, it\u0027s too late. If you or your partner cheats, you can expect up to two years, maybe even three, of hard work and pain to get over the betrayal. If you make it through, and you may, trusting each other again can take even longer. Preventing an affair before it happens is key.Comments (34)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesIs this really where the GOP is going in 2013, taking on straight sex too? And that raises yet another question: Is it time for a reporter to ask Cuccinelli, currently the Virginia attorney general, if he\u0027s ever engaged in cunnilingus or had anyone go down on him?Comments (654)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorWe may shift into higher gears, but if we\u0027re zipping along through gated neighborhoods in a Ferrari with no passengers from the bottom 99 percent, we\u0027ll still be in trouble.Comments (18)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureOur cities were once engines of growth and prosperity. They\u0027re still rich with potential resources, both human and material.  But restoring them will require faith -- in the future, in our people, and in our ability to meet and overcome challenges.Comments (576)Renee FisherAuthor, SpeakerOlder men love the idea of younger women. This is the same as me loving the idea of a string bikini. I can certainly buy it, and I can certainly wear it. But at some level, I sort of know that kind of swimsuit and I should have parted ways at least 10, 20, 25 years ago.Comments (345)Sarah ErdreichAuthor, \u0027Generation Roe: Inside the Future of the Pro-Choice Movement\u0027Going through nine months of pregnancy and now raising a child has made me even more pro-choice than I ever thought possible.Comments (41)Jon HotchkissCreator, ThisvsThatShow.comThe one and only thing men fear during pregnancy is that during sex, they will poke the baby in the head with their penis. Amazing, right?Comments (492)Bill Moyers and Michael WinshipAnd you thought the government didn\u0027t have a jobs program. It does. The problem is that the pay and benefits are lousy, and in many cases the working conditions ain\u0027t so great either.Comments (43)Bret HoekemaFilmmaker and writer, www.CultivateStudios.comWith your stem cells, I can imagine life as an ordinary thirty-something. Back at work. Earning a salary. And writing about something other than life with cancer. With your stem cells, I can imagine a second chance at my first year of marriage and the dreamy possibility of my 50th.CommentsMaura CheeksWriter and Social Media ConsultantAs a professional athlete my father experiences the ultimate paradox almost on a daily basis. When he is seen in the context of sports, he is a hero. When the wrong people see him as simply a black man in America, he is a suspect.Comments (16)Fernando Henrique CardosoFormer President of Brazil; Member of the Berggruen Institute’s 21st Century CouncilHow much of this money is used to corrupt the security forces along the borders of source countries? How much of this money is used to bribe police or is laundered through financial institutions? These are not impacts of drug use. They are impacts of a policy that does not accept real-world conditions.CommentsEduardo GaleanoAuthor, \u0027Children of the Days: A Calendar of Human History\u0027Many civilians, most of them women and children, were killed or maimed. No one knows how many, because tradition dictates tabulating the losses suffered by invading troops and prohibits counting victims among the invaded population.Comments (42)Bishop Minerva G. CarcañoBishop in The United Methodist ChurchComprehensive immigration reform must include the reunification of immigrant families, including LGBT families. It must include a pathway to citizenship. And it must include the just treatment of immigrant workers.Comments (11)Alastair TattonDirector of Mixology EventsSince the announcement of a royal baby, the nation has been counting down the months, weeks and days until the arrival of our future king. Well, finally the wait is over!Comments (15)Rep. Frederica WilsonU.S. Congresswoman from Florida\u0027s 24th DistrictThis summer -- as Congress debates border security, Benghazi, the IRS, the NSA, the Justice Department, and further deficit reduction -- one issue is conspicuously absent from the agenda: What about our jobs crisis?Comments (150)Romany MalcoActorWhen we signed on to do reality shows that fed into the media\u0027s stereotypes of black men, we ingrained an image of Trayvon Martin so overwhelming that who he actually may have been didn\u0027t matter anymore.Comments (2,863)Kate SpencerWriter, producerOur cultural conversation about pregnancy, birth and motherhood is way off from what the actual experience is. And it\u0027s hurting women.Comments (154)Dr Raj Persaud and Dr Nicholas MorrisYou might consider that being born a royal means you are born lucky - are some people indeed born lucky? The luckiest people alive - or at least people who believe they are lucky - are born in May. The Royal baby, it appears, has missed out being born in May by around two months - how unlucky is that?Comments (41)Gov. Jack MarkellGovernor of DelawareOn July 17, I signed into law a bill enabling the formation of a new type of corporation that is hard wired to compete to be the best in America at being the best for America. These new Delaware public benefit corporations will harness the power of private enterprise to create public benefit.Comments (88)Chris MarvinManaging Director, Got Your 6Veterans bring skills for leadership, team building and problem solving. They understand strategy and tactics. They have a global perspective, yet can relate to everyday Americans. They are good leaders.Comments (14)Keith Lawrence and Gretchen SusiThe President reminds us that the long-running negative beliefs about blackness are invisible but extremely powerful forces that drive the context surrounding those structures that need to be intentionally targeted for change as well.CommentsMarty KaplanDirector, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolYou wouldn\u0027t realize from these campaign-style ads that what\u0027s really at stake is money. Your money. Both CBS and TWC want more of it. They\u0027re probably going to get it. The only issue -- which this battle is about -- is how they\u0027ll divvy up what they pick from our pockets.Comments (56)Amitai EtzioniProfessor of international relations, George Washington UniversityThe apparent conflict between Israel\u0027s security needs and the Palestinians\u0027 aspirations for a \"real\" state calls for thinking outside the box. Treating the two states as members of one commonwealth, may move the deliberations in a constructive direction.Comments (72)Mike WeisserThe Gun GuyHave you noticed how each side in the current argument about guns has a favorite statistic that they like to throw around? Does anyone know where these numbers come from? Here\u0027s the answer.Comments (751)Wendy BrandesFine jewelry designer and fashion bloggerAre you finally ready to try skinny jeans but wondering if the trend has already passed you by? After all, no less a wit than Oscar Wilde declared \"Fashion is ephemeral. Art is eternal,\" in an 1885 newspaper essay called \"The Philosophy of Dress.\"Comments (16)Anna Musky-Goldwyn, 2013.23.07Mark Nepo, 2013.23.07Robin Amos Kahn, 2013.23.07Alvin Lopez Woods, 2013.23.07Eric Sheninger, 2013.23.07Nhojj, 2013.23.07Brad Friedman and Desi Doyen, 2013.23.07Fernando Henrique Cardoso, 2013.23.07Michelle Cove, 2013.23.07Jonathan Handel, 2013.23.07Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"HUMA STANDS BY HER MAN",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile AppsSponsor Generated Post","h2":"Using a mobile device?
