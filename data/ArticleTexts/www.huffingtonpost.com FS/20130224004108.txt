{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe same winds of hatred, storms of violence, and easy access to and glorification of guns that Dr. King believed killed President Kennedy would soon also kill Dr. King. Fifty years after Dr. King described our morally inclement climate, the outward signs of racial intolerance and hatred have undoubtedly diminished but there are still far too many reminders of the dangers lurking everywhere that devastate us all — like Trayvon’s senseless death. We are all in the same boat and must act together to stop the plague of violence. Gun safety laws that only apply in one city or state can’t fully stop our national epidemic of gun proliferation and violence any better than we can stop a flu epidemic by vaccinating one family. We must struggle together to stop gun violence and to change the morally inclement climate that Dr. King warned about if we are going to protect all of our nation’s children everywhere.Read Post | Comments (297)Honor Harger, 02/22/13Artist and curatorImages of space are ubiquitous in our lives. We have been surrounded by stunning portrayals of our own solar system and beyond for generations. But in popular culture, we have no sense of what space sounds like.

So where\u0027s the outcry? Why aren\u0027t more people up in arms? Why aren\u0027t big businesses (including major military contractors) and Wall Street screaming into the ears of the GOP?

But it will definitely lift millions of Americans out of poverty, stimulate the economy, and create new jobs. It is the right thing to do both morally and economically.Read Post | CommentsKeli Goff, 02/22/13Author and political correspondent, TheRoot.comThere are parents who believe their children should be welcome everywhere -- even in places where people are willing to pay not to be near them.Read Post | Comments (1,390)Bianca Jagger, 02/22/13Founder and Chair, Bianca Jagger Human Rights FoundationViolence is a cycle, and it perpetuates itself.
