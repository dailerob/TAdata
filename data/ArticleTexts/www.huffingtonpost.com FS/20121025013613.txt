{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Lecturer on Ethics in Science, Harvard UniversityThe polarized politics of our time, joined with an appetite for pigeonholing, exert pressure on everyone to categorize themselves. Sometimes people declare themselves for \"isms\" that they have not plumbed. An example in point is conservatism. The politicians who now travel under the banner of \"conservatism\" happen to espouse views and methods that are incompatible with the philosophy bearing that name. Meanwhile members of the opposing political party have imbibed a dose of the wisdom conveyed by conservatism. This includes a cautious disposition to welcome expert reasoning about economic policy, reasoning of the sort desperately needed for recovery. When the details of this are made clear, so are voters\u0027 alternatives in the forthcoming election.Read Post | Comments (487)Keith Thomson, 10/24/12Reporter and authorI don\u0027t like uncertainty, and the current presidential polls are a hotbed of uncertainty. Fortunately there are veritable election oracles I can turn to instead: gamblers.Read Post | Comments (53)Ana L. Flores, 10.24.2012Author, Co-founder, SpanglishBaby.comI found my voice when social media entered my life. I realized that a significant contribution doesn\u0027t have to look like time or money. I can actually do as much or more good by using my innate abilities to tell a story and to connect that story to those who can activate it.Read Post | Comments (3)Howard Fineman, 10/24/12Editorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupIn the fog of this war, there are rampant rumors about which side is moving troops where, about who is \"pulling out\" or \"moving in\" to which swing state, about who is making a big last-minute ad buy in which media market. It sounds like trivial mechanics. Yet it is serious, deadly serious, and may be decisive.Read Post | Comments (2,525)Martin Lewis, 10/24/12British-born, Hollywood-based humorist, commentator, producer and radio hostDonald Trump has the least transparent hairdo in the history of this country. There\u0027s never been anything like it. Sadly we know very little about the Donald\u0027s hair and he has spent millions of dollars on hair products to make sure it stays that way. So, I have a deal for the Donald -- a deal that I do not believe that he can refuse.Read Post | Comments (64)Lori Leibovich, 10/24/12Executive Lifestyle Editor, The Huffington PostThis summer, before embarking on a weeklong vacation to Maine, I gave my children an order: \"If you see me doing anything on my iPhone besides taking pictures, take it away from me.\"Read Post | CommentsJames Franco, 10/24/12Actor and authorThe New York Post has been sniffing around for academic gossip because they can\u0027t write about me stumbling out of clubs. I think my class\u0027s collaborative film Tar says it all: they can kiss my ass.Read Post | Comments (60)Dawn Laguens, 10/24/12Executive Vice President, Planned Parenthood Action FundMitt Romney: It is time to withdraw your endorsement of Richard Mourdock. We can\u0027t go a week in this campaign without another out-of-touch politician showing his true colors on women\u0027s health issues.Read Post | Comments (20)Tavis Smiley, 10/24/12PBS talk show host, PRI radio hostToo many close elections are decided by the margin of eligible voter absence at the polls.

Should her feelings swell, negatively or positively, the first person she will share them with is her new husband.Read Post | CommentsPaul Brandeis Raushenbush, 10/24/12Senior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostAbortion is always a deeply personal decision that a woman comes to only after serious reflection. To take that decision away from a woman and to force a woman to carry to term a pregnancy -- especially when it is the result of a rape is the most gruesome form of religious oppression.Read Post | Comments (326)Rev. Tyler Wigg-Stevenson, 10/24/12Director, Two Futures Project / Author, The World Is Not Ours To SaveWe should remember the moral stakes of electing the person with a \"finger on the button\": every four years, Americans entrust a single individual with control over weapons that could destroy all human life.Read Post | Comments (42)Gordon Brown, 10/24/12Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationAs UN Special Envoy for Global Education, I believe we must collectively realize a world where all children can go to school and learn. A world where school is a safe place and where no one is threatened for wanting an education.Read Post | CommentsElectric Literature, 10/24/12Saving literature one reader at a timeDino Buzzati is one of the great literary practitioners of the dark marvelous. To my mind, he constitutes one corner in the triangle of indispensable 20th century Italian fantasists, a status he shares with his contemporaries Italo Calvino and Tommaso Landolfi.Read Post | CommentsChip Davis, 10/24/12Composor, musician, creator of Mannheim SteamrollerI love Halloween. I know how strange that must sound coming from a man who\u0027s made his livelihood off selling Christmas music, but it\u0027s the truth.Read Post | CommentsMike Lux, 10/24/12Partner, Democracy PartnersOne of the things that the wealthiest and most powerful of the insider special interests do to move their interests along is to drop things right before the election that the general public won\u0027t notice but that all the inside D.C. players definitely will. Jamie Dimon managed to score just such a deal on Monday.Read Post | CommentsRobert Reich, 10/24/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Not a day goes by that we don\u0027t hear Mitt Romney claim that businesses aren\u0027t creating more jobs because they\u0027re uncertain about the future. In fact, Romney has created far more uncertainty than anyone else. He offers a virtual question mark of an economy.Read Post | Comments (244)Elaine Goldsmith, 10/24/12Artist and community volunteerNobody is pro-abortion -- but anyone who saw the world of back-alley abortions and botched procedures, as I did, would ever want to go back to those days.Read Post | Comments (107)Nicole Glassman, 10/24/12Holistic Nutritionist, Founder of Mindful HealthVow to begin today with no regrets. Commit to showing the world why you are here. Promise to live with passion. Spread your wings, stretch your spirit and learn to soar. After all, tomorrow is a present to be lived today.Read Post | CommentsP.G. Sittenfeld, 10/24/12Cincinnati City CouncilmanWhy would an unknown private family foundation spend significant money calling attention to voter fraud in areas that are mostly far more likely to have low-income and minority populations? The answer is as sad and shameful as it is self-evident: To scare. To intimidate. To confuse.Read Post | Comments (48)Michelangelo Signorile, 10/24/12Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesThere\u0027s a stark difference between these two candidates on LGBT rights, more than between any presidential candidates in history. On this issue, silence is golden only for Romney, as he tries to present himself as a moderate and win the election.Read Post | Comments (111)Dan Collins, 10/24/12New York Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostOn behalf of New Yorkers, I apologize, America.
