{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressThe latest wrinkle in the debate over the so-called fiscal cliff is the attempt by House Speaker John Boehner to get his fellow Republicans to swallow his \"Plan B\" -- essentially a proposal that would allow taxes to be hiked on millionaires in order to prevent a deal from being born that\u0027s more amenable to President Barack Obama. If we are more poised to \"go over\" the \"cliff\" now than we were before, it\u0027s because \"Plan B\" has been deemed a complete non-starter by a White House who -- once again! -- was willing to make a deal on reforms to earned-benefit programs like Medicare that would make previous Republican House caucuses so numb from happiness and hugging that you\u0027d think they\u0027d been slipped a potent dose of Ecstasy. Nevertheless, \"Plan B\" has precipitated something of a watershed moment in politics, because now even Grover Norquist is sort of acceding to the reality of tax increases.Read Post | Comments (837)Bob Cesca, 12/19/12Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez Show, Media ProducerYou\u0027ve probably seen many of the gun lobby\u0027s finest agitprop slogans plastered all over Facebook, Twitter and the right-wing blogosphere these days. They\u0027re artfully designed to be digested by people who desperately want them to be true.Read Post | Comments (1,910)Anna Greenberg, 12/19/12Senior Vice President, Greenberg Quinlan Rosner ResearchThe 2012 conversation about the women\u0027s vote was not always edifying, but it did reveal and even reinforced the very limited ways that the candidates and the parties conceive of women\u0027s issues.Read Post | Comments (62)Robert Peake, 12/19/12American poet living in EnglandI live in a country with a monarch, no constitution, and no guns. I have never felt safer. The only way my homeland will begin to approach similar levels of peace will be to stop re-reading as sacred the texts of early founders, and begin actively drafting and re-drafting their own better future.Read Post | Comments (339)Lisa Belkin, 12/19/12Senior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, The Huffington PostNames are for the future.

Kennedy Center for Justice and Human RightsI was eight when we lost my father Robert Kennedy to a man with a gun. I can\u0027t begin to know what these days have been like for the families of Newtown. But I know that for loved ones left behind, some wounds may be healed by time, but there are others for which there is no cure but to take action.Read Post | Comments (66)Chris Kelly, 12/19/12Writer, \u0027Real Time with Bill Maher\u0027The critics who love Zero Dark Thirty praise it for not taking a position, one way or the other, on torture and murder.

Tansey, 12/19/12Pychologist, authorThere are those who wonder if the massacre could somehow have been predicted and prevented by better law enforcement coordination and awareness of the troubled profile of Adam Lanza.

Pure folly!\"Read Post | Comments (76)Arianna Huffington, 12/17/12Mass shootings have become a defining feature of modern America. Yet on the issue of gun violence, President Obama has shown a gift for eloquent rhetoric but no follow-through.

Ackerman, 12/19/12Professor, UNAM-Mexico City; Visiting Scholar, American UniversityThe National Rifle Association (NRA) should be applauded for its willingness to \"offer meaningful contributions to help make sure this never happens again.\" But the discussion should be guided just as much by the plight of Mexican children as by the fears of suburban mothers.Read Post | Comments (16)Douglas Anthony Cooper, 12/19/12Novelist, Amnesia (See: Blogger Mortis)The father of a 15-year-old Columbine victim protested at NRA headquarters, and was told: \"Your son should have had a gun, you stupid motherf*****.\"Read Post | Comments (27)Craig Kanalley, 12/19/12Senior Editor, Big News \u0026 Live Events, The Huffington PostIf Instagram was going to make big changes to its service, as many feared, I at least wanted to know what else was out there.

That part has got to stop. You can have your guns, but you have responsibilities.Read Post | Comments (2,704)Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, 12/19/12Rabbi and WriterChallenging God in the face of suffering is not blasphemous.

In fact, it\u0027s been here all along.Read Post | Comments (50)Allison Fitzpatrick and Alison Winter, 12/19/12Much of the Instagrab controversy and negative PR could likely have been avoided had Instagram clarified its intent at the outset, rather than backtrack as a result of a massive Internet outcry.Read Post | CommentsRichard (RJ) Eskow, 12/18/12Writer; host, \u0027The Breakdown\u0027; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureNews reports say the president\u0027s proposed deal includes the \"chained CPI,\" which would impose drastic Social Security cuts and tax hikes for everybody but the wealthy.
