{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOJohn McCain isn\u0027t interested in second place. Can you imagine the living nightmare that would be the rest of his life if he does all the disgraceful things he\u0027s done and then loses, too? If you can\u0027t imagine it, he can. I think John McCain has one more trick up his sleeve. I think John McCain is planning our terror. I think John McCain is going to pitch the Flat Tax. Dangerous? Erratic? Crazy? You mean, as opposed to Vice President Miss Wasilla?Read Post | CommentsBIODonald Ray Pollock, 10.17.2008Shouldn\u0027t you really be asking John McCain why he thinks he won\u0027t have to raise any taxes if he\u0027s elected? That promise is as ridiculous as his recent statement about knowing how to get Bin Laden.Read Post | Comments (21)BIOHarry Shearer, 10.17.2008New Orleans may be, according to the old slogan, \"the city that care forgot\", but, judging by this campaign, it\u0027s certainly the city America forgot.Read Post | Comments (23)BIOWilliam Bradley, 10.17.2008It\u0027s clear that the problem lay not with significant numbers of voters lying to pollsters, but with the nature of the campaign itself. The \"Bradley effect\" was created by faulty polling.Read Post | Comments (41)BIOPatrick Kampert, 10.17.2008The scary thing about Palin is her willingness to say just about anything -- and the outside chance that she might actually believe the verbiage she\u0027s spewing.Read Post | CommentsBIOPaul Hipp, 10.17.2008With angry mobs shouting \"terrorist\" and worse at some of his party rally\u0027s, McCain has \"doubled down on the anger.\"Read Post | Comments (23)BIORick Hasen, 10.17.2008Fraudulent voter registrations don\u0027t translate into election fraud at the polls that has any reasonable chance of influencing an election, much less a presidential election.Read Post | CommentsBIOPaul Rieckhoff, 10.16.2008Not once during the presidential debates did we hear any substance from the candidates about how they plan to support our veterans.Read Post | Comments (58)BIOSteve Clemons, 10.17.2008I have no idea what General Powell might do with regard to his Meet the Press appearance on Sunday -- but I know that he\u0027s pondering something big.Read Post | Comments (21)BIOBetsy Perry, 10.17.2008I don\u0027t know what dinner at Sette Mezzo costs because my friend George obviously gets a bill sent home monthly. But one would never know from this restaurant that we\u0027ve fallen on hard times — or is it possible they\u0027re eating out of nervousness?Read Post | CommentsBIORobert L. Borosage, 10.17.2008The Wall Street Journal peered fearlessly today into the increasingly likely terror of an election that produces a Democratic President with larger Democratic majorities in Congress.Read Post | Comments (218)BIOAlan Dershowitz, 10.17.2008I am getting dozens of emails asking me how as a supporter of Israel I can vote for Barack Obama. Let me explain.Read Post | CommentsBIOSteven Weber, 10.17.2008Whoever wrote McCain\u0027s speech at the Al Smith dinner last night should be praised. Whoever\u0027s been ruining his reputation, his campaign, his credibility and his message should be dumped. They\u0027re a joke.Read Post | Comments (90)Matt Littman, 10.17.2008Kumi Naidoo, 10.17.2008John Seery, 10.16.2008Mike Barnicle, 10.16.2008Marisa Treviño, 10.17.2008Dawn Teo, 10.17.2008Janet Grillo, 10.16.2008Sanford Levinson, 10.16.2008Sloan Barnett, 10.17.2008Daniel Sinker, 10.16.2008Arianna Huffington, 10.16.2008Nora Ephron, 10.16.2008Judy Muller, 10.16.2008Bill Cusack, 10.16.2008Christina Bellantoni, 10.17.2008Charles Karel Bouley, 10.17.2008Gretchen Rubin, 10.17.2008David Paulsen, 10.17.2008Thomas DeLorenzo, 10.17.2008Dr. Woodson Merrell, 10.17.2008","h1":"Using a mobile device?
