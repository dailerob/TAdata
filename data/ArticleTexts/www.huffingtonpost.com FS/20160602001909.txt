{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressHere’s a quaint memory from a bygone period in American politics: Back in November 2012, after President Obama secured his re-election, the New York Times’ Scott Shane reported that with “the possibility that President Obama might not win a second term,” his administration had “accelerated work in the weeks before the election to develop explicit rules for the targeted killing of terrorists by unmanned drones, so that a new president would inherit clear standards and procedures.” It was, as Shane noted, the latest attempt to formalize these policies and protocols since reports that previous summer had revealed the “shifting procedures for compiling ‘kill lists’” and the like. But — but! — it had, apparently, become “particularly urgent” to nail this stuff down once “it appeared that Mitt Romney might win the presidency.”Predatory for-profit education is a scam that works so well that Donald Trump is far from the only celebrity, or politician, to invest in it. While some for-profit college operators are honest and do a good job training students for careers, many of the biggest operators have engaged in behavior quite similar to what is alleged to have occurred at Trump University.Attorney, advocate, writer at RepublicReport.orgWith a busy career as an actress on \"Orange Is the New Black,\" my life sometimes feels more out of control than ever. At the same time, I know that the opposite is also true: That I am the captain of my ship; I am the master of my fate. And I would never have known that if it were not for my hair.Actress, writer and entrepreneur from New York, NYFor better or worse, Gawker is entitled to the same freedom as any other news outlet. If it crosses the line, as it likely did with wrestler Hulk Hogan, the courts should deal with it. Silicon Valley\u0027s power brokers should not get involved because they have access to resources that rival those of governments. They can outspend any other entity and manipulate public opinion.Academic, Researcher, Writer, EntrepreneurI believe almost everybody is happy when Americans donate to help our veterans. However, they aren\u0027t as happy when the rich and powerful use our veterans as props for their self interests.Warren took a break from laying waste to a certain Republican presidential hopeful on social media and fending off rumors that she\u0027s on the veep shortlist to chat with me about the personal side of personal finance.Author of \u0027Get a Financial Life\u0027 and \u0027Make Your Kid a Money Genius\u0027 (coming soon!), member of President\u0027s Advisory Council on Financial Capability for Young AmericansAt issue is a little-known UN committee that accredits non-governmental groups (NGOs) to participate in some meetings and conferences, including the Human Rights Council in Geneva.

And yes, this could happen to you too!Writer, actress, bloggerDonald Trump brags about \"branding\" his political opponents. He repeatedly has called Marco Rubio \"Little Marco,\" Ted Cruz \"Lyin\u0027 Ted,\" and Hillary Clinton, \"Crooked Hillary.\" Repetition makes these epithets stick -- a lesson Trump has drawn from the advertising world and his own fragile ego.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorJust as Lord of the Flies is not about Jack, this year\u0027s campaign is not about Donald Trump. The grown-up Republican primary voters who have made Trump their presumptive nominee, have yielded to the same primitive temptations as the boys of the book.Author of \u0027Sally Ride: America\u0027s First Woman in Space\u0027 and an award-winning broadcaster and authorOregon State cared more about football and money than my mom. I know that my mom wanted to kill herself, and I know that she almost did. And all because other people decided that football, money and reputation were more important than me and my brother having a mother.Student athlete and proud OregonianThe path to becoming a smart mom starts long before the birth of your first child, and even before the double lines of a pregnancy test appear. Just as prenatal vitamins help us build our reserves of iron and folic acid, certain money habits adopted early make us stronger and better prepared for the financial shock of family life.Author of \"Smart Mom, Rich Mom\"My choice is tempered with self-understanding and a healthy dose of self-love. The tale of my mane is a love story. It is a radical and political declaration of the love I have for myself. It\u0027s a sisterhood within me. My hair has history.Writer, Speaker, Creator, Blogger, Carefree Black Girl, unapologetic weirdo and aspiring cat lady.I may not be the sharpest knife on the rack. But as a liberal who lives in the Heartland, I can explain. Trump is white America\u0027s sleazy divorce lawyer. So much of White America feels so deeply embittered that it wants a divorce. All Trump did was to stroll in and offer to take the case.Science and Religion Correspondent for the Humanist MagazineIt was a rage at the entire situation, at being expected to shut the f**k up and go inside all the time because I was a young woman.Kameron Hurley is an award-winning author of nonfiction, and science fiction and fantasy.Trump graduated college in 1968 and managed to not serve in the Vietnam War as the conflict reached its deadly apex. For some reason this campaign season the press doesn\u0027t much care about the topic and has largely walked away from the model of previous cycles when Baby Boomer candidates were repeatedly pressed to explain their \u002760s wartime years.Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaWhat\u0027s really bothering me is how much Hillary bashing is coming from you, Bernie lovers; from people whose opinions I admire, from folks who\u0027ve spent their lives creating a better society.Changemaker, Rulebreaker, StorytellerMy husband didn\u0027t want our daughters to grow up thinking that they had to have permed hair to feel beautiful and accepted.

So let me say something that isn\u0027t being said enough.New York City based writer and mother to a blue-eyed future olympian.We fiddle, and the republic burns. It\u0027s sickening. Donald Trump, man-child arsonist, is day by day torching the most sacred American values and we, the media, are covering it like a bemused recap of House of Cards.Editor-at-large for MediaPost; Co-host of public radio\u0027s Peabody Award-winning \"On the Media\"If you have transitioned to wearing your hair natural and learned a lot about hair care, self-love, beauty standards, racial identity and yourself in the process, we’d love to hear your story.Blog Editor, The Huffington PostBlog Editor, The Huffington PostIt\u0027s been six years of attacks with no alternatives.

Reporters will continue to ask you tough questions, along with all the other candidates, because it is their job.Hofstra Journalism ProfessorScience and engineering are providing us with increasingly clear pictures of how to solve many of our challenges, but policymakers are increasingly unwilling to pursue the remedies that scientific evidence suggests. Instead, they take one of two routes: deny the science, or pretend the problems don\u0027t exist.Political advisor, writer, novelist, filmmaker, science advocateLet us be brave. Let us stay open to pain and hold space for what, ultimately, is not about pain as much as it is about love, connection, and life.Founder, Global First Ladies Alliance; Former Senior Advisor, U.S. Department of StateJerry and I have been Bernie\u0027s constituents in Vermont for 35 years.
