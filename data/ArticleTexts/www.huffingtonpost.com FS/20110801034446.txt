This week also saw the funerals of two very different artists: Amy Winehouse, a talented but troubled performer, who died at 27 (joining Hendrix, Joplin, Morrison, and Cobain in a \"forever\" club you definitely don\u0027t want to be a member of), and Michael Cacoyannis, the 90-year-old director of my all-time favorite life-affirming film, Zorba the Greek.

Well, it\u0027s even more magical when there are two white dresses.Read Post | CommentsAlec Baldwin, 7/29/11ActorAmericans are caring. And what those who are opposed to raising the debt ceiling are essentially attempting to do is insist that we stop caring.Read Post | CommentsArianna Huffington, 7/26/11There is still no deal in the debt ceiling impasse between Congressional Republicans and the president, so we can\u0027t say who \"won.\" But we can definitely say who lost: America.Read Post | CommentsHenry Louis Gates, Jr., 7/28/11Alphonse Fletcher University Professor, Harvard University; Author/Filmmaker, \u0027Faces of America\u0027In one sense, the major \"African American Experience\" unfolded not in the United States, but throughout the Caribbean and South America.

Doing so would likely be seen as forsaking core personal and social identity.Read Post | CommentsDavid H. Murdock, 7/27/11Chairman and owner, Dole Food Company, Inc.People are constantly asking me: What do I eat? What should they eat? What should they do to help avoid disease and live longer?

Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law at the University of ChicagoWhat is the relevance of section 4 of the 14th Amendment to the current crisis?
