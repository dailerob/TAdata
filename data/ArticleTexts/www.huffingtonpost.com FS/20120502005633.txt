{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"The Obama administration has every reason to celebrate the anniversary of Osama bin Laden\u0027s killing, as does the country. The president made the right decision and it was a great example of leadership, courage, and competence at a time when all three are in short supply in our politics. Less laudable is Obama\u0027s attack ad questioning whether Mitt Romney would have made the same call to go after the man behind the 9/11 attacks. There are many legitimate and important policy differences between Governor Romney and President Obama -- but the depth of Mitt Romney\u0027s patriotism is not one of them. Indeed, this line of attack -- that a combination of an opponent\u0027s lack of patriotism and low machismo makes him a national security threat, and therefore unelectable -- is particularly \"despicable.\" The internalization of this cartoonish notion of machismo and the acceptance of it as a value in political leadership has had a deeply detrimental effect on the decisions of our leaders.Read Post | Comments (315)Doug Kendall, 05/01/12Founder and President, Constitutional Accountability CenterThere is an enormous gap between tea party activists\u0027 fervor about the Constitution and what is actually in our Nation\u0027s founding charter.Read Post | CommentsBriony Westinghouse, 04.16.2012Reporter, Aspiring XenoarchaeologistBriony Westinghouse reporting from the field with Part Two of my investigative series, \"Earth Things Which Could Be Aliens.\" In this segment, I uncover the true identities of high-profile extraterrestrials living among us.Read Post | Comments (39)Steve Clemons, 05/01/12Publisher, \u0027The Washington Note\u0027The Republican Party needs to re-center itself, recapture the core values it used to believe in, and bring in the likes of Richard Grenell to create a much healthier party. That is probably a long way off but it needs to happen.Read Post | CommentsRyan Gosling and John Prendergast, 05/01/12After you learn a little about Fidel, there are other profiles of courageous Congolese living their lives and standing up for what they believe in.

This spin isn\u0027t about sex, it\u0027s about power. The bondage narrative moves women back from little power to no power.Read Post | Comments (34)Malou Innocent, 05/01/12Foreign Policy Analyst, Cato InstitutePresident Obama\u0027s arrival in Afghanistan and signing of the strategic partnership agreement with President Karzai supposedly represents yet another corner turned in our nearly eleven year (and counting) war.Read Post | CommentsMark Gongloff, 05/01/12Chief financial writer, The Huffington PostAlan Greenspan said something about the budget deficit on Tuesday. The reason this is \"news\" is because it is shocking that Alan Greenspan is still allowed ever to speak publicly about matters of importance.Read Post | Comments (13)Dan Collins, 05/01/12New York Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostMitt Romney rolled out Rudy Giulani today in a bid to inoculate himself from Democratic suggestions that he is too weak to have whacked Osama bin Laden. The terror-fighting duo brought pizza to a New York firehouse. It was not the stuff of legends.Read Post | CommentsVictoria Comella, 05/01/12Senior publicist, PenguinThe whole concept of organ donation isn\u0027t something that most people think about very often, unless of course you happen to know someone who has done it or if you\u0027re walking around with a heart that isn\u0027t your own.
