Given all that has happened over the last eight years, that oath is not nearly as pro-forma as it used to be. During his final press conference yesterday, President Bush said that when it came time \"to protect the homeland\" he would \"worry about the Constitution of the United States.\" It wasn\u0027t clear, as it hasn\u0027t been for most of his time in office, whether his concern was directed at upholding the document or circumventing it.

That\u0027s a new record for a president.
