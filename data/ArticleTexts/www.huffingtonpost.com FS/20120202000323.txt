After all, besides your mother or spouse, who do you count on to care about your well-being more than your doctor does? That is literally his or her job. But what I\u0027ve found is that the same incentives distorting banking, energy, education, and government are distorting our very bodies. For American health care providers, the goal isn\u0027t to get you healthy, but to get you paying.

So if we parents have to buy Valentines anyway, why not send the money to children and schools less fortunate than our own?Read Post | Comments (38)Michael Roth, 2/1/12President, Wesleyan UniversityI\u0027m embarrassed to say that one of the key places where candidates and citizens acquire a taste for -- and skills in -- negativity is higher education. For decades now, we have promoted a culture of criticism in which you show how smart you are by tearing apart somebody else\u0027s ideas.Read Post | CommentsJohn Feffer, 1/31/12Co-director, Foreign Policy In FocusIf the house organs of the financial sector and the house intellectuals of the Right are all talking like a Marxist study group, then perhaps we are on the verge of a major transformation -- not only in terminology but, more importantly, in the facts on the ground.Read Post | Comments (120)Lisa Belkin, 1/31/12Senior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, Huffington PostNever has a presidential candidate lived so searing a parenting tale while he campaigns. In that way, the former Pennsylvania Senator\u0027s life is both a very singular and personal story, and also a very public window into the kinds of private choices families find themselves making across the country every day.Read Post | Comments (178)Azeem Ibrahim, 2/1/12Research Fellow, Harvard Kennedy School’s International Security ProgramFor the vast majority of the electorate, the economy trumps most other issues. Candidates who continue to raise anti-Muslim fears should be seen as irrelevant distractions from the real problems of the economy, jobs, civil rights, education and health care.Read Post | CommentsGov.

McDonald, 2/1/12Associate Professor, George Mason UniversityWhat will happen in the general election if Romney is the nominee is anyone\u0027s guess. I suspect that Republican conservatives will line up behind Romney, but they will not do so enthusiastically, as the low voter turnout in contested states thus far shows.Read Post | Comments (33)Abraham H.
