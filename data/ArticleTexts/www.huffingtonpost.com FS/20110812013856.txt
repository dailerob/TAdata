{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This is truly a Latino moment. Latino Americans -- 50 million strong and counting -- are both the largest and the fastest-growing minority in the country. They played a decisive role in the 2008 election, making the difference for Obama in Florida, Colorado, and New Mexico. They represent close to a trillion dollars of buying power. And with 32 million Hispanics online, they are among the most wired and connected groups in the country. So I\u0027m delighted to announce the launch of HuffPost LatinoVoices. These are really challenging times for millions of Latinos. But as I said when I recently spoke at La Raza\u0027s conference in Washington, as an immigrant to this country I know that the immigrant spirit and resilience that are at the heart of the American experience can help us overcome whatever obstacles lie ahead and truly move mountains.Read Post | CommentsSheryl Sandberg, 8/11/11Chief Operating Officer at FacebookMy life is better because of Gloria Steinem.

Hilda Solis, 8/10/11U.S. Secretary of LaborAs the country\u0027s first Latina Labor Secretary, I appreciate both how far our community has come and how far we still have to go. Latinos come from a heritage of hard work, but our great work ethic will only flourish if we have the qualifications for job openings where we can apply it.Read Post | CommentsCurtis Roosevelt, 8/11/11AuthorA wartime president has many responsibilities, one of the most important of which is to know why America is at war while clearly conveying those reasons to our citizens. That is patently not the case today.Read Post | CommentsRobert Stavins, 8/11/11Director of the Harvard Environmental Economics ProgramNo matter how one feels about the wisdom of Standard \u0026 Poor\u0027s downgrading of long-term U.S. debt, the issue of greater concern should be their assessment of the state of the U.S. body politic.Read Post | CommentsMarcus Samuelsson, 8/11/11Chef, AuthorRead Post | CommentsElanor Starmer, 8/11/11Western Region Director, Food \u0026 Water WatchWhen it comes to demand for local foods in the Bay Area, there\u0027s no shortage.

Levine, 8/11/11The Friendship DoctorFriendships carry risks when they unravel and this is particularly true in the workplace. Yet, we spend so much of our lives at work that it\u0027s natural we would develop close friendships there.Read Post | CommentsKarl Frisch, 8/11/11Syndicated Columnist, Democratic Strategist, Progressive Radio PersonalityWhat will tea party voters think when someone points out that Rick Perry was elected not once but three times as a Democrat, voted for what remains today the largest tax increase in modern Texas history, and even served as state chairman of Al Gore\u0027s first run for president?Read Post | CommentsRep. Jesse Jackson Jr., 8/11/11Representative, 2nd District of IllinoisNeither Mitch McConnell nor John Boehner has felt the need to nominate a minority or a woman to the Super Committee that will have a lot to say about who will suffer the most under the new committee\u0027s decisions.Read Post | CommentsArt Brodsky, 8/11/11Communications Director, Public KnowledgeDespite the general sympathy one might have for the unions as they fight to preserve their benefits, the policies the Communications Workers of America follows can\u0027t help but generate not a little schadenfreude.Read Post | CommentsLouis Peitzman, 8/11/11Freelance arts writerI want to be excited about a new blue-collar sitcom starring Roseanne. But as it stands, I\u0027m not optimistic. It\u0027s not that I don\u0027t have faith in Roseanne: on the contrary, I place most if not all of my faith in her.
