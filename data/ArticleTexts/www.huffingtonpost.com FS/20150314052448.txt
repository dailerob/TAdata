{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Children\u0027s Defense FundWhat a terrible irony that in this year of celebration of the Selma marches we are witnessing the resurgence of overt law enforcement brutality and injustice in Ferguson, Cleveland, New York City, and elsewhere, reminding us how far we still have to go. The continuing protests against unequal justice under the law by those enjoined to protect all of us and all of our children after the deaths of teenager Michael Brown, 12-year-old Tamir Rice, and others are a wake-up call about the deeply embedded systemic racism still alive in America. Each of us has a responsibility to root it out and stop it in its tracks.The rhetoric may be getting more shrill, but the goal remains the same. The question is whether he is in a better position to do something about it now that he is the chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee.Director, Arms and Security Project, Center for International PolicyThere is no way to stop the barrage of insulting, deceptive attacks that will be leveled at Clinton, or any candidate for that matter, but the least we can do is refuse to be influenced by people who distort the facts, resort to fiction and refuse to do the level of research that separates journalists with integrity from imposters.Professor Emerita, USC Marshall School; Author, \u0027The Secret Handshake\u0027 and \u0027Shadow Campus\u0027A situation like this calls for a real apology, but these young men have failed to deliver it. Instead of acknowledging their own racism, they denied it or sidestepped it. Instead of reckoning honestly with the harm they have done to others, they framed their family and friends as the real victims.Lecturer in the Yale English department and Faculty Fellow at the University Church in YaleLast Saturday, during the 50th anniversary event of \"Bloody Sunday,\" I spent many hours just looking at that bridge. The words that kept coming to me were \"courage\" and \"resistance.\" My question became: What bridge we will now have to cross?Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersHelene Emsellem is one of our leading experts on how to understand and treat sleep disorders, especially in adolescents.

A 2014 poll by Weber Shandwick and Powell Tate in partnership with KRC Research found that most people think America has a raging civility problem.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarOne of the simplest and most powerful things you can do for another person is to listen to them. Giving someone your attention shows that you respect them and can also improve the quality of your relationship with that person.Productivity blogger and happiness life hackerYoung people should not be regarded as useless and unemployable -- they are far from it. They can offer a wealth of talent and potential, but quite often they simply don\u0027t have the support, guidance or know-how to turn this into reality.Singer-songwriterModel and photographerWhy, in the face of everyday temptation, do some individuals fail miserably while others coast by unscathed? Psychological scientists have been puzzling over this problem for years, but the answer remains elusive.Author, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027Before we get on with all the politics, we have two unrelated announcements. The first is tomorrow\u0027s quirk in the calendar.

Minute by minute and hour by hour, you\u0027ll get stronger. You still aren\u0027t sure if you want to live, but you\u0027ll begin to consider things beyond this moment.Author, blogger, project/program leader, business professor, and inspirational speaker who uses a solution-oriented approach to address life and business challengesIn his new book, Frank reveals how he decided to come out of the closet as a gay man, the impact that decision had on his political career, and his subsequent efforts to advance LGBT rights.E.P.

Find a problem that matters to you and become the change agent you were meant to be.Author, Speaker, EntrepreneurThe end of coal as an important global commodity is coming - not in the next few years, but it\u0027s coming fast. So the Senator is wasting his energies trying to stop progress and should instead help those who will be hurt by the shift.Founder, Winston Eco-Strategies; Author, \"The Big Pivot\" and co-author, \"Green to Gold\"A reinvigorated \"People\u0027s Foot\" movement to end mountaintop removal is ramping up its efforts next week, as the last vestiges of outside support begin to abandon the nation\u0027s most egregious strip mining operations in central Appalachia.Author of \"Reckoning at Eagle Creek: Secret Legacy of Coal in the Heartland,\" www.jeffbiggers.com\"The Christians\" weren\u0027t the standoffish clique historians frequently make them out to be. Many Christians, in fact, were perfectly good Roman citizens.

This is what democracy looks like -- even the rigid, unaccountable structure of the eurozone will not be able to stop it from spreading.Co-director, Center for Economic and Policy Research, Washington, D.C.Sport at its best requires athletes to give more than they thought they could -- physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually. And because of that, whether we\u0027re experiencing sport firsthand as athletes, or secondhand as fans, it is, as Reid said, \"life with the volume turned up.\"Author, How We Can Save Sports: A Game PlanI\u0027ll admit, though, from time to time I\u0027ve worried that like many things I should be doing differently -- work-life balance, downward dogs, leaning -- I may be doing morning wrong, not living up to my Morning Potential. Am I really supposed to do all of the morning steps those articles recommend? In the same morning?Author of women\u0027s fiction (ON GRACE and THE BALANCE PROJECT: A NOVEL) and Founder of The Balance Project interview series.I ask myself why in the world I choose live performance as a career on, perhaps, a daily basis. It depends on when, as to the vote for or against such a peculiar vocation.Broadway, Film and Television ActorNot only have Republicans blocked comprehensive immigration reform when it had a real chance of passing, they\u0027re now trying yet again to bring up unconstitutional bills to drive their point home.Political Director, People For the American WayJust like Netanyahu uses Iran over and over again to avoid discussing the real issues facing Israel, the Israeli Center-Left is using, \"anyone but Bibi\" to achieve the same results.Israeli student at Hunter College, NYC.

It is woven throughout the fabric of the City of Boston.54th Mayor of BostonShort, declarative sentences don’t speak to me as a reader in the same way as long, winding, tenuously bound together spools of thought. The semicolon represents nuance, a gray space between an unbroken thought and two entirely separate ones.Books Editor, The Huffington PostA benign appearance -- well-dressed types testifying before Congress, pontificating in print and on TV, or even filling key positions in the executive branch -- belies a malign impact. Do we really need that chatter? Does it enhance the quality of U.S. policy? If policy/defense/action intellectuals fell silent would America be less secure?Author, \u0027The Limits of Power: The End of American Exceptionalism\u0027Like Glenn Greenwald, we should be concerned about the Azov Battalion and high-ranking extremists in the Ukrainian government. But the real darling of the far right is Putin. It\u0027s no surprise that European extremists are intoxicated by his authoritarian style. The mystery is why some on the left have also drunk the Kremlin\u0027s Kool-Aid.Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogMaybe the reason why some people are so inspirationally successful is because they have failed behind the scenes so many times and we don\u0027t even know.
