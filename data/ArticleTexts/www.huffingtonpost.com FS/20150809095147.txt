{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week gave us a night of truly must-see TV. First, 17 Republican candidates squared off in two debates on Fox News. The would-be presidents mostly competed to see who could sound the most bellicose, who hated the government more, who could show more contempt for undocumented immigrants and poor people, and who would repeal Obamacare (and deny 10 million people health insurance) the fastest. We learned military spending needs to be greatly increased, and that we need to start a new ground war with ISIS -- and possibly Iran. We heard little about the economy and nothing about climate change. Though Ronald Reagan was invoked, this was more midnight than morning in America. Then, a few hours later, in an act of supreme scheduling irony, Jon Stewart memorably said goodbye, reminding us that \"bullshit is everywhere,\" and \"the best defense against bullshit is vigilance.\" And also how desperately we\u0027ll miss him. #JonVoyageSchumer voted for the Iraq war on a rationale similar to the one he now urges as the path of reason and good sense with Iran. He may or may not recognize that he is only assisting the Likud and the neoconservatives with part three of the Middle East \"clean break\" strategy: Iraq, Syria, Iran.Professor of Literature, Yale UniversityWhile I, too, mourn the killing of Cecil the Lion in Zimbabwe, it revives in me an uncomfortable memory. Some 50 years ago, I went on my first (and only) wild-game hunt -- the most stupid thing I\u0027ve ever done.Actor, author of 10 books and a book of poems \"Life Could Be Verse” published by HCI, December 2014The one constant I\u0027ve noticed is how incredibly difficult it is for transgender folks to transition and become their authentic selves and still be healthy and secure -- emotionally, physically, financially...the list goes on and on.Public speaker, activist, OlympianI watched the debates last night with two questions in mind: Who would give Hillary Clinton a run for her money? And who would be a good and useful vice-presidential running mate? Both lists are surprisingly short.Davidson-Kahn Distinguished University Professor and Professor of Law at Florida International University; Floershimer Distinguished Visiting Professor of Law at Cardozo Law SchoolWe applaud Gov. Cuomo for temporarily instituting a special prosecutor to investigate tragedies like Raynette Turner\u0027s death. But we find it necessary to highlight a glaring question: Is it reasonable to keep a visibly sick mother of eight in jail for two days because she allegedly stole food?Founder of Garner Way Foundation and daughter of Eric GarnerPolitical Director for Garner Way FoundationIt is an embarrassment that the Republican-led Congress has refused to consider legislation to repair that damage to the Voting Rights Act. We are facing a two-pronged attack on our democracy -- unlimited money poured into the political process, paired with the systematic suppression of the vote.Democratic candidate for President, US Senator from VermontPresidential elections are not reality TV. This is self-governance. And just as money is now making a mockery of American democracy, the news media\u0027s obsession with ratings is now making a mockery of American politics.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoIt was hard enough to get the right to vote and own property and make decisions about our own bodies. Now we seriously have to defend the idea that \"women\u0027s health issues\" are important enough to merit 0.0001 percent of the federal budget?Actress, Activist, People For the American Way Foundation Board MemberThere is at least one candidate who may support policies that will make it easier for people in developing countries to benefit from the knowledge the world has accumulated over many thousands of years.

And their proposed increases are phased in gradually over several years. It might behoove some of those commenting from the sidelines to stop calling them crazy.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributor34Justice co-founder and bloggerTrainwreck is predictable in part because it\u0027s Hollywood, but if you peel away the layers, it sends a message that is not at all untrue. Even--spoiler alert--Amy learns about her own double standards.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarI learned that decisions women make about our reproductive health aren\u0027t about death, but about life. Whether we are faced with an unintended pregnancy, or when a wanted pregnancy goes heartbreakingly wrong, we are simply trying to live the life we want for ourselves and our families.Wisconsin State Representative. Progressive. Advocate. Mother. Former Planned Parenthood Policy Director. Attorney.In 40 years of dealing with presidents, prime ministers and other leaders, I could count on one hand the times I have heard a president or a prime minister or other high official speak candidly about the mistakes their country has made. It may be that I can count them on two fingers.Former President, East Timor, 1996 Nobel Peace Prize laureateIran, like Iraq\u0027s Saddam Hussein, wants us to believe that it is close since that makes Iran both powerful (scary) and that threat provides great leverage in dealing with the rest of the world.Host, Fox News\u0027 \u0027On the Record With Greta Van Susteren\u0027These images have the potential to inspire new ways of thinking about our human condition on a planet with a friendly ecosystem now under threat from activities we can and must change.Chairman, Generation Investment Management and The Climate Reality ProjectThe killing of Cecil the Lion, tragic as it might be to some, has laid bare some key issues that warrant further discussion. Few -- if any -- of these people rallying for ol\u0027 Cecil have shown their public concern and care for Zimbabweans.Editor and contributor, Conversation ZimbabweKeystone remains the clearest test of whether or not the President is willing to do what is truly necessary to address the climate crisis: Keep fossil fuels in the ground. It\u0027s the simplest way to see whether Obama has the courage it takes to stand up to Big Oil and say \"no.\"Co-founder and Communications Director, 350.orgThe best option to stop Iran from building a nuclear bomb and the best option to avoid another war in the Middle East is this deal.Senior Member of the Senate Foreign Relations CommitteeThings got off to a rollicking start with Trump\u0027s show-of-hands refusal to rule out a third-party run and Rand Paul\u0027s aggressive reaction. This riveting kickoff set a pugilistic tone for the debate that never subsided.Professor of Journalism, Northeastern University, BostonYes, losing my pregnancy was the worst thing that has ever happened to me. But it was also a universal experience, and one that now connected me to a cloud of mothers like Priscilla who gave me hope for myself and the future of my family.Healthy Living EditorThere are a great many other voters willing to imagine a future without Wall Street greed and rampant income inequality. \"Bernie Sanders Can Become President\" has replaced \"I like him but he can\u0027t win.\" With only a limited amount of media coverage, Sanders has captivated the hopes of millions of Americans.Columnist and author published in The Hill, The Baltimore Sun, The Jerusalem Post, Salon, and other publicationsIf the death of Cecil the lion leaves you angry and frustrated, it might be time for you to be just as furious over the deaths of unarmed civilians killed and beaten by those hired to protect and serve us.
