{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"APAt the moment, everyone is giving advice to the Democrats about how to beat the Republican spinmeisters. Even Republican spinmeisters. On the latest Real Time with Bill Maher, it was GOP language guru Frank Luntz dishing out advice to me and anyone else who would listen. Frank is the supreme reality reframer who took the estate tax and turned it into the \"death tax,\" and turned drilling for oil in a wildlife preserve into \"responsible energy exploration.\" It is Frank\u0027s contention that Democrats keep losing presidential races they should win because they are too critical and too angry.
