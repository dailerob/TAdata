{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027This Labor Day, working families do not have much to celebrate when it comes to wages and job security. But we can celebrate the fact that the deteriorating conditions of work are finally breaking through into broad political consciousness. Last week, the board of directors of Market Basket, one of the last of the independent supermarket chains, agreed to restore the fired CEO, Arthur T. Demoulas, who had treated workers decently rather than just milking the enterprise for dividends as another faction of this family-owned company has sought to do. An uprising by salaried managers and workers had brought the business to a halt. The Market Basket story is particularly instructive, because it represents how so-called shareholder capitalism puts pressure on managers to destroy job security and decent earnings for working people.Because of the injustice he saw inflicted on his grandparents, Fred Redmond has sought to ensure through collective bargaining that workers receive fair compensation for their labor and that every worker gain entrance to the middle class.International President, United SteelworkersAs of this week, Ebola is killing 100 people every couple days in West Africa. But the true impact of the crisis in West Africa should be measured in the wider impact the disease has wrought. It is not Ebola alone causing the catastrophe in West Africa today -- it is an epidemic of fear.Assistant Professor of Emergency Medicine, Brown Medical SchoolUntil now, President Obama\u0027s foreign policy appeared to be based more on reason than emotion. However, the rise of ISIL may have cost Obama his equanimity. After promising to strictly limit the mission in Iraq, Washington is preparing to expand the war to Syria. Instead, the administration should push other nations into the lead.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteThe spectacle of Mitch McConnell kowtowing to Charles and David Koch and other billionaires gathered recently at a luxury resort. This is going to help define the national narrative for the 2014 campaign -- these tapes make 100 percent clear that the modern Republican party is controlled by the Kochs and their billionaire friends.Co-Founder, Democracy PartnersThis week, millions of young people head to college and universities, aiming for a four-year liberal arts degree. They assume that degree is the only gateway to the American middle class. It shouldn\u0027t be.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Almost daily, we are faced by difficult choices we are challenged to confront over a range of foreign and domestic policy concerns. As these choices play out, I am often guided by an important lesson I learned more than four decades ago from one of my heroes in the U.S. civil rights movement, Julian Bond.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Those stout-hearted Americans who were so upset that their president discussed serious matters in a tan suit last week, had good and patriotic reason for their outbursts. But perhaps they didn\u0027t notice what would certainly have relieved them of their concern.Founder, People for the American WayAs a nutritionist counseling families and children, here are some simple tips to get you and your family off to a healthy start.Nationally-recognized nutritionist; International Speaker; Adjunct professor of nutrition at NYU; Author, \u0027The Portion Teller Plan\u0027It is unfortunate that few Americans know much about labor history and the Reuther brothers, who built the United Auto Workers union that transformed the broader labor movement and helped build the nation\u0027s middle class.E.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeGiven our overabundance of media and the endless rehashing of \"everything that happens\" by everyone with a news show, a blog, a computer; a mouth; frankly, we\u0027re all exhausted, seriously exhausted.Sass \u0026 SensibilityUnable to persuade Qatari leaders to drop their support for the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamist groups, Saudi Arabia appears determined to deprive its tiny neighbor of its regional soccer supremacy.Senior fellow, S. Rajaratnam School of International StudiesGive yourself ample time for sleep, and create a sleep-friendly environment and routine, and your body can tell you a great deal about how much sleep you need.Clinical Psychologist; Board Certified Sleep SpecialistIs there a correlation between the drop in unions and the drop in defined benefits plans? It certainly seems like it. As defined benefit plans are going away, so is the safety net for older Americans. Most bankruptcy filers are under age 54, but there is a steady rise in bankruptcies of people over age 55.Founder of McNayConsulting.com \u0026 Best Selling AuthorSure, we must pay attention to what our graduates will do with their education, and we must give them the skills to translate what they learn in classrooms to their lives after graduation. But we shouldn\u0027t reduce our understanding of \"their lives after graduation\" to their very first job.President, Wesleyan UniversityJust because you don\u0027t see a tip jar doesn\u0027t mean that tips aren\u0027t appropriate or welcome.Author and commentatorIn these incredibly challenging times in the Middle East, parts of Africa and Asia, the world needs small countries with New Zealand\u0027s record to be sitting in the UN Security Council. And it is important for other small UN member states to see New Zealand win and know that the UN Security Council is accessible for them too.Former President, East Timor, 1996 Nobel Peace Prize laureateAs political leaders debate whom to blame for the surge of child migrants, most agree on one goal: deporting the children as quickly as possible. Yet few advocates of their removal are willing to state on the record that the children\u0027s death is a strong possibility.Director, Federal Immigration Appeals ProjectWhile it\u0027s good to raise awareness, let\u0027s not forget that the people we\u0027re trying to help need us now, not after their disease has taken away everything they have.Writer, Artist and FreethinkerCongratulations, America. This is why we can\u0027t have nice things. And when historians of the future look for someone to blame, I hope they include a brief mention of the outrage over Obama\u0027s ordinary suit.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027The cumulative and convergent toll of subtle, but discouraging, adult actions in schools and other child-serving systems they come into contact with too often impedes the success of children of color, especially those who are poor, and burdens them with an emotional toll they don\u0027t deserve.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundGiven our national obsession with work, employment means a lot for not just our pocketbooks, but also our dignity and place in society. From my perspective, the bottom line for the American Dream is inclusion in the workforce.REDF President and CEOWhen I looked at those parents and children, I heard the anguish in my friend\u0027s heart. The joy and pride of one moment. The emptiness and confusion of another. My own tears as I watched my son drive away.Clinical Psychologist, Mental Health/Midlife BloggerIt was worth the wait for Hillary Clinton to speak out. Clinton skipped the platitudes and echoed the uncomfortable truths that black men are routinely profiled, disproportionately pack America\u0027s jails and prisons, and get longer sentences than white males.Author and political analystIf you\u0027re doing an outstanding job, your bosses will do what it takes to keep you. All that you need is a plan. Here\u0027s one you can carry out in ten easy steps.CEO, The Creative Class Group \u0026 Author, UpgradeThey\u0027ve always been there for you, and as you\u0027re planning your wedding, you\u0027ll likely need their help more than ever -- here\u0027s how to stay in tune with your best friends and keep them happy.The go-to guide for all things weddingsWhat we know today as \"email\" is a really a system -- a system of interlocking parts, each of which is essential for ordinary people to communicate effectively with one or many others. As a part of the Huffington Post\u0027s History of Email Series, this post provides details on the first email system created at UMDNJ in 1978.Senior IST Technologist at Rutgers Medical School (RMS) in the school of Biomedical SciencesThe battle against a medieval religious mindset is not only occurring in Syria and Iraq, but here at home. While we must show respect for religious liberty, one of our founding principles and the core of the First Amendment, we need to understand the motivations of our opponents if we are to make further progress.Executive Director, Gender Rights MarylandI have found in taxi drivers, restaurant owners, municipal workers, police officers, firemen and women, \"migrants\" and immigrants from many states, a variety of countries, generous people who love the democratic principles and virtues of these United States.Reverend; General Secretary of the General Board of Church and Society, United Methodist ChurchOf the more than 2.3 million people worldwide who are diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, I am only one story.
