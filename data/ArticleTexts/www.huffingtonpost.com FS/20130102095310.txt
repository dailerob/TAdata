{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Director, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \u0027The Price of Civilization\u0027The White House and Senate have agreed to make the Bush tax cuts permanent for 99 percent of households, starving the federal government of funds. Even Mitt Romney could never have accomplished for the Republicans what Obama has just done for them. The Democrats in the Senate would have soundly rejected the plan if the Republicans had put it forward. There has been a special absurdity to the entire negotiating process, which has violated every standard of rationality and transparency. And meanwhile, the Federal Government is being dangerously weakened in its capacity to help America address the economic, environmental, and social challenges of the 21st century.Read Post | Comments (623)John Cusack, 01/01/13Makes filmsRecently, I sat down with George Washington Law School professor and constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley and my close friend Kevin McCabe to discuss WikiLeaks\u0027 impact on transparency, the government\u0027s response, and the comparison to the Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg.Read Post | Comments (173)Robert Reich, 12/31/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The deal emerging from the Senate is a lousy one.

That was not to be. The Republicans would not allow it.Read Post | Comments (926)Howard Fineman, 12/30/12Editorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupI\u0027m headed back to Washington knowing what I had guessed when I left town: that the so-called fiscal cliff \"talks\" would still be going when I got home.

Like the guy in seat 26B just in front of me right now on a flight from Honolulu to Los Angeles, who is probably a nice guy on the ground. But put him on a plane, and shortly after takeoff, he jams his seat into my knees without so much as an apology.Read Post | Comments (126)Kevin Bacon, 12/31/12ActorI\u0027m setting six New Year\u0027s resolutions that celebrate help, hope and humor.

However, if 2011 kept news editors across the world on their toes, I think it\u0027s fair to say 2012 certainly rose to the challenge.Read Post | CommentsJudith Browne Dianis, 01/01/13Co-Director, Advancement ProjectMy dear ancestors, you might have trouble recognizing our nation today.

Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorIf Senators McConnell and Reid hammer out a budget deal that can pass their caucuses, Rep. Boehner is likely to take it up in the House.
