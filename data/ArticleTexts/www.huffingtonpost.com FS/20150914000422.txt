First, in Washington, the Iran nuclear agreement cleared its biggest hurdle, as opponents lost a key procedural vote in the Senate. Maybe former Vice President Dick Cheney, whose strong opposition to the deal is among the best arguments for it, provided the winning margin. To drive the point home, the White House released a cutting video montage of Cheney\u0027s wildly wrong assessments of Iraq, showing he was \"wrong then, wrong now.\" Meanwhile, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert finally debuted, with a literally biting bit about the media\u0027s Trump addiction, and an interview featuring a suave Jeb Bush and a stilted Colbert (actually, switch that). As Colbert said, \"I used to play a narcissistic, conservative pundit -- now, I\u0027m just a narcissist.\" But still very, very funny. And, given his poignant interview with Joe Biden, very, very human.What is happening in Europe makes me think about our own country\u0027s hopelessly broken immigration system. There are uncomfortable parallels in the two situations.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersAll political candidates dissemble. Indeed, all people do. A degree of deception is required in order to be civil. \"It was a pleasure to meet you,\" is often just a way to gracefully exit a conversation. But at what point does a political candidate take deception too far?Professor Emerita, USC Marshall School; Author, \u0027The Secret Handshake\u0027 and \u0027Shadow Campus\u0027The Kim Davis situation raises interesting questions about the meaning and practical effect of the freedom of religion. Although, for reasons that I will explain, the issue today is one of public policy, rather than constitutional law, the evolution of constitutional principles in this realm is illuminating.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoDr. Michael Breus is a clinical psychologist and author of The Sleep Doctor\u0027s Diet Plan: Lose Weight Through Better Sleep. In answer to my questions, he shared his thoughts on the major obstacles to getting a good night\u0027s sleep, the steps you can take to improve your sleep, and the future of sleep technology.More is at stake than individual health; international security is at risk. Experts have identified water as the number one global risk in terms of significant negative impact on countries in the coming decade. Water can either be a source of conflict or cooperation.Deputy Secretary-General, United NationsCongress shall make no law prohibiting the free exercise of religion.

Unless and until we confront the root reasons why patterns of violence against women work, both overt and covert violence against women will continue to be a political mainstay.Professor of Theology, Chicago Theological SeminaryIf there was ever a time for the world to seize the opportunity to commit to undertaking bold action, it\u0027s now. 2015 is the year, and we have now reached the crucial weeks that matter most.Founder, Virgin GroupI fear that many of my Republican colleagues do not understand that war must be a last resort, not the first resort. It is easy to go to war, it not so easy to comprehend the unintended consequences of that war.U.S. Senator from VermontIn this world, there are few things as painful as the look on the face of a child yearning for the home she used to know, wishing for a way out, desperate for school and the chance to build a stable life.President and CEO of the U.S. Fund for UNICEFBecause of something called carried interest, the top 25 hedge fund mangers paid a lower tax rate than the average kindergarten teacher in 2014. Billionaire hedge fund managers don\u0027t need a tax break, and there is no reason this loophole should exist.109th Mayor of New York CityWhatever our stories - wherever we were on September 11, 2001 - our 9/11 generation remembers the horrific moment when the attacks were seared into the American psyche.Chair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusWe\u0027re not even two years removed from the last time the Tea Party wing of the Republican Party held Congress hostage and forced the federal government to shut down for 16 days. Sadly, the wheels are already in motion for another shutdown.Has represented south central Wisconsin in Congress since 2012.I am the first person in my family who was born and raised in America -- something I\u0027ve always recognized as a core part of my identity and, more importantly, in my ongoing identity crisis. I am American. I am Indian. I am Sikh. But I\u0027ve always considered myself American first.Lifestyle Blog Editor, The Huffington PostToday we launched a campaign will make it possible for all of America to be great. Not just Silicon Valley or Hollywood. Not just Nashville or Broadway. Not just the heartland or the White Mountains. But even Washington, D.C. too. Today we have launched a campaign to give us a government we can be proud of again.Law professor, activist, candidate in the Democratic Primary for PresidentAt the end of this month, thousands of representatives from all over the world will gather in New York. They will witness the launch of the most ambitious universal effort since the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. The reshaping and re-stating of the \"larger freedom\" of those rights in a new agenda has a deadline of 2030 for a new, fairer, more sustainable world, with at its centre the drive to achieve full equality of men and women.United Nations Under-Secretary-General and Executive Director, UN WomenWe cannot continue indefinitely to strike at jihadists in Iraq while stopping, absurdly, at the border of the neighboring state.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.If we keep executing defendants in cases like Richard Glossip\u0027s, where the evidence of guilt is tenuous and untrustworthy, we will keep killing innocent people.Co-Founder and Co-Director of the Innocence ProjectIt\u0027s expensive to be poor. So expensive in fact that people who live below a country\u0027s poverty line can end up paying 5-15x per liter of water compared to people who live above that poverty line.Chief executive officer and co-founder of Water.orgActor and Co-founder, Water.orgI am a woman in a man\u0027s profession, and it\u0027s certainly time that the prevalence of societal sex-stereotyping is publicly addressed. We begrudgingly accept this level of misogyny and anti-family sentiment when it\u0027s subtle, constitutive and mixed with praise for being tough. After all, this is surgery. And surgeons are tough.Breast cancer surgeon, mom, wife.At a time many Republican presidential candidates and state legislators are furiously focusing on private morality -- what people do in their bedrooms, contraception, abortion, gay marriage -- America is experiencing a far more significant crisis in public morality.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027I am now the parent of two beautiful girls. One of my vows when they were born was to pass my father\u0027s soul-building gift of listening on to them.New York Times Bestselling Author and Certified Special Education TeacherOne of the most under-appreciated aspects of the climate change problem is the so-called \"fat tail\" of risk.

Founder of Soul Anatomy.The Broncos, widely used in the Vietnam war, were delivered to Indonesia in 1977-1978, when the slaughter of the Timorese civilian population was at its worst.

Most Americans are little aware of either of these events.Former President, East Timor, 1996 Nobel Peace Prize laureateThere has been much talk this last week of an upcoming Cabinet reshuffle, and I don\u0027t presume to make comment one way or another as to who should go where -- with one notable exception. Mr Abbott, can I respectfully suggest that you consider handing over your role as Minister for Women.Editor-at-large, HuffPost Australia, and host of TodayAs a member of the European Parliament, what bothers me most is that even now, with the biggest refugee crisis since WWII knocking on Europe\u0027s doors, the E.U. doesn\u0027t seem to be conscious of its magnitude.
