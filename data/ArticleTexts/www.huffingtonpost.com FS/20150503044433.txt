The media, once again, focused only on the most sensationalized elements -- in this case, a CVS being looted, footage of which looped endlessly -- ignoring both the long historical context for the anger and the substance of the more representative non-violent protests. But those protesters\u0027 calls for justice were, in fact, being heard. On Friday, Baltimore City State\u0027s Attorney Marilyn Mosby charged the six officers involved in Gray\u0027s arrest with a range of crimes including murder and manslaughter. \"I\u0027ve heard your call for \u0027no justice, no peace,\u0027\" she said in announcing the charges.
