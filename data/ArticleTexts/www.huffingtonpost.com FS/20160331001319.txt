{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"No matter who we are, we share a common need for sleep. Though this need has been a constant throughout human history, our relationship to sleep, and our understanding of its vital benefits, has gone through dramatic ups and downs. And right now that relationship is in crisis. At the same time, we\u0027re living in a golden age of sleep science -- revealing all the ways in which sleep and dreams play a vital role in our decision making, emotional intelligence, cognitive function, and creativity. I wrote The Sleep Revolution to examine this ancient, essential, and mysterious phenomenon from all angles, and to explore the ways we can use sleep to help regain control over our out-of-kilter lives. The goal of the book is to move us from awareness to action. So I hope you\u0027ll be inspired to renew your relationship with sleep -- in all its mystery and all its fullness -- and join the sleep revolution, transforming your life and our world one night at a time.The sources of this story never asked for money. What they wanted was for some of the wealthiest and most powerful figures in governments and companies across the globe to be exposed for acting corruptly, and with impunity, for years.Investigative journalist for The Age, The Sydney Morning Herald and Four CornersI\u0027m praying still for Bernie Sanders, because he\u0027s the only one willing, at least in the name of fiscal sanity, to cut back on our foreign interventions, bring the troops home, and with these trillions of dollars no longer wasted on malice, try to protect the \"homeland\" by actually rebuilding it and putting money into its people, schools, and infrastructure.Award-winning filmmakerDonald Trump landed in Wisconsin Tuesday, turning out a huge crowd in Janesville. With dozens of vendors hawking goods, there was a carnival-like atmosphere to the event unlike any other. Trump ditched the standard stump speech for a withering attack on Wisconsin\u0027s conservative establishment.The Center for Media and Democracy/ALEC ExposedYour house will never be clean again.Writer, actress, designer and mom of twins who shares her DIY\u0027s and parenting stories in the hopes to make you laugh or evoke conversation.Maybe it takes one to know one. Maybe the fact that I have lost three times on a national scale has given me a special insight. But I can assure you, I know one when I see one, and you, Donald Trump, are a loser.Democratic candidate for U.S. Representative of North Carolina\u0027s 2nd Congressional DistrictNeocons tell us that continued, massive US intervention abroad could not make things worse. This is the question the next president will have to address and candidates for the office should be asked about now.Professor of international relations, George Washington UniversityWhat\u0027s being done about keeping the world\u0027s deadliest materials out of the hands of terrorists? A lot. But progress is slowing, and the fourth Nuclear Security Summit being held in Washington may be the last chance to put tools and processes in place to solidify the gains and create a path to an effective global security system that will protect us all.President and Chief Operating Officer of the Nuclear Threat InitiativeForty eight years ago, the Republican Convention, held in Miami, changed the American political scene, perhaps forever. The forthcoming Republican Convention in Cleveland may well do the same.Former Republican CongressmanA key lesson for Pakistan\u0027s elites is that short-term military action and executions, important as they are, are no substitute for structural reforms, especially of school curricula and religious institutions that breed intolerance and Islamic nationalism.Writer, journalist and international development practitioner. Faculty, Ithaca College; C.Editor at The Friday Times, Fellow at National Endowment for Democracy, Washington D.C.Hillary Clinton can only demonstrate this leadership by taking responsibility -- and fully disclosing the facts related to the vast amounts of special interest money that she and the Clinton family have taken personally and for their foundations.Social Policy and Legislative AnalystMy joints would ache throughout the day, throbbing headaches were a daily occurrence and I was falling asleep at my desk. I worked a 50-60 hour a week job, which was exhausting, and all I ever wanted to do in my free time was sit on the couch, watch TV and eat. I was consuming around 4000 calories per day -- over double the daily recommendation for a woman.Learning to live the healthy life permanently, dropping a kilo at a time with the aim of losing half my body weightIt is easy to look at today\u0027s political ugliness and feel overcome by pessimism. Yet reasons abound to stay hopeful. In light of millennial trends, the rise of Donald Trump and that of his European counterparts looks more like an inelegant postprandial burp after a century of raging nationalism.Executive Director of the think tank Youthonomics and CEO of mYgrationAlthough a substantial increase in internal security personnel, intelligence gathering and sharing between the European community are critically important, they will not in and of themselves drastically stem such terrorist attacks.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUI want to express my anger at the shameful images that have circulated widely on the Web (though for once not widely enough) of a manhandled journalist, her glasses ripped off, dragged away by police, veritably kidnapped, and stashed in a jail that in principle is reserved for the dregs of humanity.French philosopher and writerPresident Obama\u0027s recent visit to Argentina demonstrated two things. First, that when it comes to the tango, he is not a great dancer. And second, while the United States likes to lecture other countries about past sins, it refuses to reflect deeply on its own.Professor of International Affairs, Penn State UniversityFor years, the refrain of \"fear of blowback\" kept the government from going after the Taliban in certain regions. But the slaughter of children in Peshawar was the last straw.Campaign Director, Alif Ailaan; Columnist, The NewsRegulators and operators need to understand that security of nuclear materials is a strategic risk that should be managed in coordination with other strategic priorities and objectives, and the public needs to know whether safety and security are being managed effectively for the benefit of all.Executive Director of the Vienna-based World Institute for Nuclear Security (WINS),a non-governmental international organization of nuclear security professionals.Education is in crisis because of the calculated effort to turn it into a business with a bottom line. Schools are closed and opened as though they were chain stores, not community institutions. Teachers are fired based on flawed measures. Disruption is considered a strategy rather than misguided and inhumane policy.Research Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027What is Hillary going to do that her husband didn\u0027t? Well, maybe nothing more than to simply look into the subject again. But, Kimmel upped the ante. What if Hillary finds that the government really does have proof of aliens?Senior Astronomer, SETI InstituteWhen you press Democrats on their uninspiring deeds -- their lousy free trade deals, for example -- they reply that this is the best anyone could have done. But let\u0027s choose a locale where Democratic rule is virtually unopposed, a place where Republican obstruction and sabotage can\u0027t taint this experiment.Author, \u0027Listen, Liberal, or What Ever Happened to the Party of the People?\u0027At the fourth nuclear security summit this week, world leaders will discuss how to prevent ISIS and other terrorists from getting their hands on the ingredients of nuclear terror. And Belgium\u0027s prime minister might be the leader with the most to say. Since the 2014 summit, Belgium has suffered a number of suspicious and alarming activities at its nuclear sites. Fortunately, Belgium has shown that there are clear actions that can drastically reduce the risk.Professor, Harvard University; Co-Principal Investigator, Project on Managing the AtomSaying that the Qur\u0027an is the real culprit of Belgian terror attacks would be the same as saying that the Bible is the real culprit behind the Spanish Inquisition. Both of these statements are false.Lawyer, writer, and self proclaimed Mortal Kombat ChampionMilitary strikes and raids generate collateral damage and blowback, arguably creating more enemies than they kill.  We\u0027re helping to sustain a perpetual killing machine, a feedback loop. Writer, Professor, Retired Lt. Colonel, Air ForceIf transgender people cannot safely pee in public, we cannot safely exist in public.Trans* and GenderQueer-identified psychotherapist in the NYC area working with sexual/gender minority populations. www.LauraAJacobs.comOur government shouldn\u0027t give a religious organization millions of dollars if it refused to provide access to reproductive health care, especially when it promised it wouldn\u0027t do so. Alas, the government has broken its promise, and that broken promise could harm trafficking victims.Senior Staff Attorney, ACLU\u0027s Reproductive Freedom ProjectBritain has now joined Mexico and France in taxing businesses when they compromise the health of our children. I don\u0027t believe it\u0027s anti-business. In the UK, kids and teenagers\u0027 single largest source of sugar is from sugary sweetened drinks and with one-third of kids overweight or obese, these statistics cannot be taken lightly anymore.Celebrity Chef and Food ActivistReal voters -- the ones out in America’s heartland who rarely get raises, who are stressed and financially pressed by trying to figure out how to support their families and pay for their kids’ college tuition and save a little bit for their retirement -- are tired of political BS, and tired of the people at the top getting all the breaks while they get none.Co-Founder, Democracy PartnersJails and prisons have a unique opportunity to serve people in need of treatment and divert them from harmful behaviors. But right now, almost every step they take reinforces an incarcerated person\u0027s reasons for using substances. A drug-related jail or prison term shouldn\u0027t carry a death risk.The full spectrum of human relationships with drugsForfeiting journalistic and social morality, news outlets have turned their frantic coverage of Donald Trump\u0027s presidential campaign into a poisonous fetish, and contributed to the progress of the most distasteful kind of clickbait -- Trump\u0027s narratives of white supremacy.Award-winning freelance journalist, educator, and writer at www.blackandwordy.comFor \u0027Fixer Upper\u0027: Drink if/when Jo says shiplap. Okay, this one may get you sick drunk. Keep a throw up bucket nearby... Jo really likes shiplap. Drink twice if they make a joke about shiplap or Jo\u0027s obsession with the white wood. Or, if Chip makes a joke about something sexual or his height.Fiction writer, blogger at Suburban Shit Show, staff writer at Club Mid and mom to four kids.Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
