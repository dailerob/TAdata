{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Richard (RJ) EskowSenior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourThis budget comes only a few weeks after President Obama declared inequality to be \"the defining moral challenge of our time.\" Early reports about the White House budget show no signs of such broad moral sweep or scope. It\u0027s one thing to proclaim the \"end of the era of austerity.\" It\u0027s another to explain precisely what that era was, why it came into being, and what we\u0027ve learned from its tragic failures. We\u0027ve been given no indication that the president or his advisers understand what a grave mistake it was to embrace the deficit-cutting rhetoric of the right, to appoint austerians to lead a Presidential Deficit Commission, or of extending the austerity framework even to programs like Social Security. Instead we\u0027re being told that the president\u0027s plan spending increases (more about those in a moment) are \"fully paid for,\" a phrase which suggests that austerity\u0027s ghost still lingers.Comments (64)Bob CescaManaging Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowReligious people clearly have the right to practice their own religion, but they\u0027re not allowed to discriminate against people because of who they are. This isn\u0027t a matter of \"No Shirt, No Shoes, No Dice,\" it\u0027s a matter of constructing a second class of citizens whose choices would be limited because of who they love.CommentsPatton OswaltComedian and writer who lives and drinks in Los AngelesI emceed for Bill Hicks in 1991, at Charlie Goodnights in Raleigh, North Carolina. It changed what I wanted to do with comedy, almost instantly.CommentsCC GoldwaterProducer of the documentary \u0027Mr. Conservative: Goldwater on Goldwater\u0027My grandfather was one of the first politicians to support gays serving openly in the military, and was known for being pro-choice and pro-immigration. But the current crop of Arizona Republicans has forgotten his policies and replaced them with the policies of divide and conquer.Comments (54)Arielle FordAuthor, Speaker, Relationship ExpertIn the past, I often defined myself by my work, and I hate to admit this, but my ego took a lot of pride in \"just how much I can accomplish\" in an hour or a day or a week.CommentsDan GolemanAuthor, \u0027Focus: The Hidden Driver of Excellence\u0027\"Mindfulness\" refers to that move where you notice your mind wandered. With mindfulness you monitor whatever goes on within the mind. \"Meditation\" means the whole class of ways to train attention, mindfulness among them.CommentsClaire FallonBooks Editor, The Huffington PostDoes the VIDA count work? It\u0027s hard to say, at this early stage. But this year\u0027s small movements may be first rumblings of larger tectonic shifts.CommentsJohn FefferCo-director, Foreign Policy In FocusIn the end, the street triumphed over the elite. Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych tried to hang on to power, and failed. Russian President Vladimir Putin tried to maintain Russian influence, and failed. The EU tried to mediate, and failed. And the United States tried to... well, I\u0027ll get to that in a moment.CommentsRaquel D\u0027ApiceStand-up comic and writer of \u0027The Ugly Volvo\u0027 humor/parenting blogI am, for now, a stay-at-home mother. People sometimes ask what exactly I do during the day and I never have any idea what to say.Comments (14)Lee A. SaundersPresident, American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIOAs the nation seeks to understand the causes and solutions of income inequality, the recent trend of outsourcing public services to for-profit corporations should be a focus of study. We\u0027ve allowed huge corporations to assume control of our schools, roads, prisons and libraries.CommentsClaire McCarthy, M.D.Pediatrician, Boston Children\u0027s Hospital, Harvard Medical SchoolIt\u0027s totally true that I could come home from work and get everything off the counter and table (again) and clean the bathrooms (again) and yell at the kids (again) to pick up all their stuff, but, well, I\u0027d rather not.Comments (45)Sandra FlukeCandidate for CA State Senate SD-26Some folks may know only what national media has highlighted about my work. I\u0027ve already begun meeting directly with voters throughout this district, but in case we haven\u0027t gotten to meet in person yet, here\u0027s some of what I\u0027d tell you.CommentsRev. Emily C. HeathClergy, United Church of ChristI\u0027m a religious person with a lifelong passion for civil rights, so this is of great interest to me. So much so, that I believe we all need to determine whether our religious liberties are indeed at risk.Comments (2,790)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Along with former Senator Alan Simpson, Erskine Bowles has become known to much of the public as the co-chair of President Obama\u0027s deficit commission. The two of them produced a report that is viewed by many in the media and leading Democrats in Congress as providing the basis for a \"Grand Bargain\" on a long-term deficit reduction package.CommentsRob JohnsonExecutive Director, Institute for New Economic ThinkingMany state and local governments are struggling to meet their obligations to retirees, and the easiest explanation is that workers are overpaid and their pensions are unaffordable. But the evidence suggests that the pensions crisis is both less pervasive and more complex than that.Comments (40)Michael WinshipSenior writer, Moyers \u0026 Company on public TV. Senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.If Hillary Clinton decides not to run, a strong progressive candidate could emerge for 2016, although doomsayers point to the failed candidacies of liberals George McGovern in 1972 and Walter Mondale in 1984. One hope for Democrats is that, like the old joke about the two curmudgeonly brothers, the other one is worse.CommentsOliver LuckettFounder and CEO, theAudienceMy eyes hurt from doing nothing but staring at screen after screen all day -- from my laptop to my desktop screen to my iPhone and my iPad, TV screens, movie screens, I realized I was always staring at something other than the world.CommentsPat GallagherCelebrity/Entertainment Journalist, www.twitter.com/@pat_gallagherHere are 21 Oscar \u0027firsts\u0027 you probably didn\u0027t know about.CommentsJennifer DziuraCareer and life coaching advice writer at GetBullish.comI\u0027ve talked a lot about our obsession with teamwork (and its dark shadow, totally unnecessary consensus), but also the WASPy, milquetoast way people speak in corporate America. Sometimes, \"collaboration\" is just another word for shared incompetence.CommentsPaul CantorWriter based in New YorkBeing unsettled and wanting more out of life is not a millennial problem or a hipster problem or a \"whatever new word marketers are using to describe young people\" problem. It\u0027s really a problem of being \"plugged in\" all the time, and never being given the freedom to shut off.CommentsA. Thomas McLellan, Ph.D.CEO and Co-Founder, Treatment Research Institute (TRI)Overdosing on heroin doesn\u0027t make you a scumbag. Having a drink after 20 years of sobriety doesn\u0027t make you weak. Having an addiction is not a moral choice. In fact, I think it is accurate to say that having an addiction is not a choice at all.CommentsBill MoyersManaging Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyIn a web exclusive interview, political scientist Adolph Reed Jr. talks with me about his new article in the March issue of Harper\u0027s Magazine -- a challenge to America\u0027s progressives provocatively titled, \"Nothing Left: The Long, Slow Surrender of American Liberals.\"Comments (15)Ruth MessingerPresident, American Jewish World ServiceI have been deeply moved by two men I know, both of whom believe in women, hate the violence perpetrated against them and are doing something about it. One is a respected Silicon Valley investor, and the other is a village chief in Senegal.CommentsPauline LewisWriter, cancer survivor, and historian in training in Los AngelesPlanning a wedding is an expensive and logistically complicated undertaking, and it is often the first (and only) large party you will throw. But you should never feel inferior, whether it\u0027s because you are in a wheelchair, can\u0027t afford a photobooth, or simply don\u0027t give a damn about the centerpieces.CommentsJohn Kerry and William HagueWe see it especially in Goma, where one of us met in a hospital with young women so damaged by rape that they required surgery. And we see it in Syria today, where rape is being used as a tool of oppression. So is this personal to us? You bet.Comments (15)David Segal and Marvin AmmoriLet us provide some context to those who relied on the Times\u0027s (non-existent) coverage of SOPA, prior to January 18th.CommentsPat OglesbyLawyer; Former Congressional tax stafferWhile marijuana revenue could be a promising new source of income for states, a wide range of expectations underscores how little we know so far about what mature markets will look like one day.CommentsCarol J. CarterAuthor and student success expertHaving an entrepreneurial spirit can be useful in creating jobs, but it\u0027s also a skill set that is valuable to many of today\u0027s employers.CommentsKate ParkerPrincipal Analyst for Economist Intelligence Unit (Latin America team), EditorThings in Venezuela look set to get worse before they get better. Even if the opposition were to win power, they could be in for a rude awakening if they try to put the economy back on track.CommentsTed Danson and Andrew SharplessAlaska has already seen more than its fair share of oil disasters, and drilling in the Arctic will inevitably bring another spill. We ask you, do we really need another Exxon Valdez?CommentsAmanda PrevidelliReporter, Brasil PostThere is something very wrong with democracy when journalists are forbidden to cover police actions and protests.CommentsKen Carbone, 2014.26.02Craig Crawford, 2014.26.02Chris Weigant, 2014.26.02Dean Baker, 2014.26.02Heather Cronk, 2014.26.02George Heymont, 2014.26.02Stephen Bell, 2014.26.02Dana Holmes, 2014.26.02Kayla Williams, 2014.26.02Susan McCorkindale, 2014.26.02Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"JUDGE: DON\u0027T MESS WITH TEXAS SAME SEXES",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
