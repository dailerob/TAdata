{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"There\u0027s an old saying in the news business: \"If it bleeds, it leads.\" That is, stories of violence, tragedies, dysfunction and corruption get top billing by default. This couldn\u0027t be more wrong. And so in Davos last month we announced \"What\u0027s Working,\" a global HuffPost editorial initiative to double down on our coverage of what\u0027s working. While we will continue to cover the stories of what\u0027s not working as relentlessly as we always have, we want to go beyond \"If it bleeds, it leads.\" That means relentlessly telling the stories of people and communities doing amazing things, overcoming great odds, coming up with solutions and facing real challenges with perseverance, creativity and grace. By shining a light on these stories, we hope that we can scale up these solutions and create a positive contagion that can expand and broaden their reach and application. You\u0027ve heard of copycat crimes. We want What\u0027s Working to inspire copycat solutions.After listening to one newscast after another rightly condemn the barbaric killing of that Jordanian air force pilot at the bloody hands of ISIS, I couldn\u0027t sleep. My mind kept roaming the past trying to retrieve a vaguely remembered photograph that I had seen long ago.Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyHow shameful it is that we allow \"personal beliefs\" to trump science!Dean for Clinical Research Education and Director of the Center for Public Health Sciences at Albert Einstein College of MedicineSome parents today are being swayed by misinformation that has caused them to delay or decline vaccinating their children, jeopardizing the health of many others. I want all people to know that immunizations are safe, and that they work.Former First LadySenator Cotton may prefer hell to Guantanamo for my clients, but what does he really know about either? What he knows is how to play politics -- a game where one thing is certain: the prisoners at Guantanamo always lose.Staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights in the Guantanamo Global Justice InitiativeAs approval of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline appears to be resting on extremely thin ice, TransCanada on Wednesday announced they would be entering the oil-by-rail business to help further their tar sands investments.California Philanthropist \u0026 Climate ChampionYes, I said it. Selfish. I thought of ways to sugarcoat that statement, but I ultimately decided against it. You may hate me for saying that, and that\u0027s fair. But someone had to say it. Want to know why? Keep reading.Law student, University of VirginiaOur courts cannot and will not be pressured by the financial interests of Big Pharma and its out-sized influence on government. With nothing less than public health and public safety at stake, our guiding principles must be science and justice, not profit or ideology.Chief Executive Officer of the National Association of Drug Court ProfessionalsChief of Science, Law \u0026 Policy for the National Association of Drug Court ProfessionalsThe king has died. Long live the king. Saudi Arabia today is a medieval system whose horrid human rights practices match its antiquated political system.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteAccording to economist Lance Taylor and his colleagues, we\u0027re not yet talking about the kinds of major changes needed to keep us from becoming a Downton Abbey society.Author and cultural theoristThe rapid rise of measles of this year has highlighted the importance of vaccines. They are heralded as one of the top 10 successes of public health in the 20th century. So why do some people -- even some health care workers -- choose not to use them?Medical doctor, epidemiologist and journalist; Staff writer at The Dallas Morning News; Professor of public health at The University of Texas at DallasLet me say this to Senator Cotton: for Emad, who has taught himself English and bears no ill-will to Americans despite his wretched treatment at our hands, being held indefinitely at Guantánamo Bay is rotting in hell.U.S. counsel for ReprieveThe IMF Guidelines demonstrate that the United States is not manipulating its currency and would not be at risk of losing a dispute. The far greater risk is that more middle class jobs will be lost in the United States as a result of foreign governments\u0027 currency manipulation. We need strong and enforceable disciplines in TPP to help prevent that from happening.Sandy Levin is the Ranking Member of the House Ways and Means CommitteeYou need to be on as much medication as is necessary to bring your blood pressure under control. However, you are best off if you are on as little medication as you truly need.Professor of Clinical Medicine, New York Presbyterian Hospital/Weill-Cornell Medical CollegeDespite the pain of needle pricks, we need to get shots -- and read claims about science carefully. Even if we may not like it. The dangers of doing otherwise could be deadly.Professor of Psychiatry and Director of the Masters of Bioethics Program, Columbia University; author, \u0027Am I My Genes?\u0027One thing is for sure, in a week when Walker wanted to be enjoying his surge in New Hampshire and telling America he is a \"fresh face,\" he is left explaining why he has so much trouble with the truth.The Center for Media and Democracy/ALEC ExposedThere is value in recognizing that, far from wanting to sustain the U.S. in its global policing role, we would do better to welcome the emergence of a new multipolar world, to recognize our limits within that emerging multipolar world, and to begin to live within those limits.Worrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsMy marriage may have failed, but all is not lost from the eight years I spent with my ex-husband. Not only did I gain a daughter, but I also learned a lot about myself that I didn\u0027t truly know before I met him. Thanks to my failed marriage, I grew up and grew on.A comedienne, writer, Columbia University graduate \u0026 ex- MTV personality, Laura will work for self-validation and chocolate.If Roy Moore isn\u0027t prepared to uphold the law, than perhaps the role of Chief Justice isn\u0027t right for him. And if he doesn\u0027t recognize that, then perhaps others should recognize it for him and remove him from office. The Court has lots of room for different legal thinkers, but it has no place for those who refuse to think about the law.President, Human Rights CampaignIf you sit down to talk with a whiskey-drinking woman (especially when she\u0027s got a whiskey in hand), expect to cover anything and everything. Expect to look up at the clock to realize it\u0027s 3 a.m. and still be hungry for more.Owner and founder, Be You Media GroupMartin Gilbert died this past Tuesday evening, February 3, after a long and difficult illness. His accomplishments are too bountiful to be summarized.Writes about the Arts, Literature \u0026 Winston Churchill. He is the proprietor of Chartwell Booksellers in NYC.I can haul ass on a rowing machine, jump rope with this super heavy rope, slam a tire with a sledge hammer, start crying for no particular reason, and then gallantly swing a kettlebell around like a frigging professional discus thrower, all within the course of 20 minutes.Writer and adjunct professor, Multimedia Communications Department at Academy of Art University in San FranciscoI must issue this disclaimer: This list is not -- in fact could not possibly be -- exhaustive. My goal is to get you ready for Sunday night with some stuff that you might not have seen.Assistant Professor of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical SchoolWhat\u0027s striking about the stretch of Congressional activity is its almost complete lack of connection to the reality of labor and employment laws in our country and how they apply (or don\u0027t apply) to businesses.National Employment Law Project Action FundCoordinator of the National Staffing Workers AllianceWhat do a measles outbreak in Disneyland and Washington\u0027s panic over Russia\u0027s leadership have in common? Both of them are red scares that should have died out by the 1960s. And, as of today, they have one more thing in common: junk science about autism.Professor of Russian \u0026 Slavic Studies, New York UniversityI spent a lot of time wondering why you did all these things and how I could get you to ease up. I know grandmothers are supposed to \"spoil the kids,\" then send them home, but you were... ridiculous. Until you were gone.author and harpoon specialistJust like immigration reform, mass incarceration and the need to change our criminal justice system are sparking another movement -- especially after the parable of Ferguson woke up the country.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersAmerica\u0027s fascination with the death penalty is fading quickly, and it\u0027s increasingly practiced by only a handful of states. But those declining numbers don\u0027t mean that serious problems don\u0027t exist with capital punishment and who gets executed.Executive Director of the National Coalition to Abolish the Death PenaltyShamefully, the Court\u0027s systematic dismantling of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act and the Court\u0027s anticipated modification of the Fair Housing Act may cause it to be remembered by history as a strict constructionist Court with neither heart nor soul.Chief Executive Officer, The King CenterI am not a scientist. I am not smart enough for that. But I am a mother. And although I am not really smart enough for that either, I do know autism from that angle. I know the rigidity and the obsessiveness and the rage over having an aide in school. I know the quiet longing that comes with being different or weird, because I see it every single day.WriterThe bright orange jumpsuit is an authentic piece of evidence to demonstrate that the human species is going bonkers. Rule of law, constitutional rights, mercy, and forgiveness are no longer the prime values.Founder, Legal Scholar Academy and Professor of LawGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"DEB DEMURS!",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
