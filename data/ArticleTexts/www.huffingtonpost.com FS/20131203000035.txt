{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Even if Obamacare does help a lot of people, my question is: at what political cost and at what long-term cost to effective social insurance? Both the conception and the roll out of The Affordable Care Act will set back the effort of liberal Democrats to persuade regular people that government can be a force for the broad public good (Social Security has no such problems). The ACA is the social-policy equivalent of the Pentagon\u0027s apocryphal $800 hammer. Even with a great deal of catch-up and good luck, it will take a miracle for Obamacare not to be a net loser for Democrats in the 2014 mid-term elections.Comments (638)Bob CescaManaging Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowYou\u0027ve probably heard the scuttlebutt about the U.S. allegedly \"closing\" its embassy at the Vatican. It\u0027s a lie.Comments (43)Ju HongResearch assistant, Harvard UniversityI am Ju Hong, the \"heckler\" that interrupted your speech last week. I spoke up not out of disrespect, however, either for you or our country. No, I spoke up -- and am writing to you now -- to ask that you use your executive order to halt deportations for 11.5 million undocumented immigrant families.Comments (293)Jay Scarfone and William StillmanSince Oz is about to celebrate its 75th anniversary next year, here\u0027s a fun peek at a few details that may have escaped the attention of even the most ardent Ozophiles.Comments (175)Wait But Whywww.waitbutwhy.comThe thing that neither the dictionary nor fake procrastinators understand is that for a real procrastinator, procrastination isn\u0027t optional -- it\u0027s something they don\u0027t know how to not do.Comments (60)Dan LyonsMarketing fellow at HubSpot and creator of \u0027The Secret Diary of Steve Jobs\u0027Why is this incredibly tight-lipped company suddenly showing off prototypes? The answer is that these drones were not designed to carry packages, but to give a lift to Amazon\u0027s image.Comments (40)Dr. Michael J. BreusClinical Psychologist; Board Certified Sleep SpecialistIf our preferences for sleep and wake times are strongly influenced by genetics and biology, what are we to do when faced with inclinations that don\u0027t match up with the demands and responsibilities of our lives?Comments (64)Dr. Karin L. SmithsonTherapist, Educator, Writer, Motivational Speaker. Spirituality Expert. Brave Mom of 3. DoctorKarin.comPeople often forget to check in on the parents. They are struggling with exhaustion, confusion and fear. Be there for them by being present to their struggle. Just listen -- they know you cannot fix things. They just need love.CommentsEmma Seppälä, Ph.DAssociate Director, Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and EducationManagers often mistakenly think that putting pressure on employees will increase performance. What it does increase is stress -- and research has shown that high levels of stress carry a number of costs to employers and employees alike.CommentsMike RoweCreator and executive producer, \u0027Dirty Jobs With Mike Rowe\u0027My appearance at TED helped solidify an idea that had started to take shape a year earlier, and the response to that appearance helped convince me that my idea had merit.Comments (36)Patricia GuerraEmmy award-winning journalistRecent reports show light at the end of the tunnel for the Affordable Care Act\u0027s infamous website. For New York non-English speakers, however, the story doesn\u0027t end there.CommentsRana FloridaCEO, The Creative Class Group \u0026 Author, UpgradeThe fashion business is highly competitive; so how do women\u0027s clothing designers Kirk Pickersgill and Stephen Wong of the fashion label Greta Constantine ensure success?CommentsAdrian NazariFounder and CEO, CreditSesame.comConsidering the influence credit scores have on almost every aspect of our financial lives, it\u0027s not surprising that so many people want to improve their credit score -- some even aiming for that perfect FICO 850. But is a perfect score really necessary?Comments (105)Clif DickensGraphic DesignerComments (25)Israel MirskyJournalistWith fewer journalists and a punishing real-time news cycle, news is increasingly composed of information that is easy, fast and inexpensive to get -- like coverage of crime and trials, opinion, celebrity, and syndicated stories.CommentsJames ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027I have seen news stories, commentaries and tweets implying that our findings have good news for the Muslim Brotherhood, bad news for the military and surprising news about the US, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. In fact the results are far more complex and nuanced.Comments (81)Paul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostBut for one to deny that the Church is anti-gay in one sentence and then to maintain a stance against gay marriage in the next adds injury to insult. Let\u0027s just be very clear here -- if you are against marriage equality you are anti-gay.Comments (897)Jessica AronsPresident \u0026 CEO, RHTPThere are a number of important issues at play in these cases, but a central one should be this: must the law accommodate those whose religious beliefs lead to conclusions that are scientifically incorrect?Comments (46)Clovis ThornManaging Director of Development, Drug Policy AllianceGiving Tuesday is a worthy response to the craven consumerism of the last few days and serves as a reminder that charity is an essential part of Christmas and other holiday celebrations. But I\u0027m already seeing a disturbing trend.CommentsAlicia KeysSinger, songwriter, AIDS activist, philanthropistTo borrow and reimagine the words of President Kennedy: We choose to end AIDS. We choose to provide access to treatment to everyone in the world living with HIV by the end of this decade, not because it is easy, but because it is hard. This is our moon shot.Comments (35)Alexander HaroAssociate editor, The InertiaWhile estimates of the number of surfers world wide vary wildly, there are a select few that, for one reason or another, have left an indelible mark on surfing. From the Duke to Gidget, this is a list of a 10 of surfing\u0027s most influential people.CommentsLincoln MitchellHarriman Institute, Columbia UniversityWorkers whose freedoms are limited by their employers are serfs, not independent citizens. Allowing companies to limit their workers choices in this way undermines basic freedoms and indeed our democratic system.Comments (735)Kaitlin Roig-DeBellisFounder, Classes 4 ClassesOn the morning of Dec. 14, 2012 inside the walls of Sandy Hook Elementary, our school endured a tragedy beyond comprehension. 26 lives were taken far too soon, senselessly and brutally. In the midst of such unimaginable loss, loss that could have very well been the loss of my own life, I had to find meaning again.CommentsDr. Rock PositanoHealth Columnist for the New York Daily NewsTis the season to beware of the dreaded gout! Next thing you know your knee, ankle, or big toe starts throbbing in the middle of the night.Comments (15)Robert NaimanPolicy Director, Just Foreign PolicyPeople have noticed the silence of former Secretary of State and widely presumed 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on the Iran nuclear deal negotiated by President Obama and Secretary of State Kerry. Where does she stand?Comments (21)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarParents have nosed around in their kids\u0027 lives ever since the invention of the telephone, but these days, technology has taken the spying game to an entirely new level with multiple points of entry, from Facebook and Twitter to Instagram, Vine, and Tumblr.Comments (185)Tom EngelhardtEditor, TomDispatch.comMany publications have advice columnists, but none has our old friend Colonel Manners (ret.), whose experience in military and surveillance matters is evident from his impressive CV (unfortunately, a classified document).CommentsDesmond Tutu1984 Nobel Peace Prize winnerWe\u0027ve come so far since the days of unnecessary dying, even without yours truly as a doctor. We don\u0027t need to fear diseases like HIV, malaria or TB as death sentences anymore, but challenges we have the power to overcome.Comments (24)Sam FiorellaPartner, Sensei Marketing; Author, Influence MarketingHow much access to your (and your friends\u0027) personal data are you prepared to share for access to free mobile apps? I suspect the amount is significantly less than that which you actually agreed to share when blindly accepting the Terms of Service.Comments (19)Wendell PotterAuthor, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgNow that November is history, will the Obamacare website work flawlessly from now on? Or, as the president has said, will it at least work for the \"vast majority\" of people who need to buy insurance on their own?Comments (49)Ben Cohen Co-Founder, Ben \u0026 Jerry\u0027s Ice CreamWith money corrupting politics, partisans shuttering government, and brinksmanship replacing leadership, this Christmas I\u0027m giving the give the gift of democracy -- rubber stamping technology that\u0027s designed to stamp big money out of politics.Comments (12)Patricia Guerra, 2013. 2.12Wyatt O\u0027Brian Evans, 2013. 2.12Israel Mirsky, 2013. 2.12T.
