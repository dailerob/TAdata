{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOAt HuffPost\u0027s lunch on the new media -- and later at the Xcel Energy Center, where the convention is being held -- I asked people to tell me where they were when they heard that McCain had picked Palin and what their first reaction was.Read Post | CommentsBIOBob Cesca, 09.02.2008Newt Gingrich on MSNBC just referred to Palin as McCain\u0027s \"soulmate.\" I really don\u0027t think the Republicans understand what that word means. And now he just said that Obama was never the commander of the Alaska National Guard. Neither was Palin.Read Post | Comments (401)BIORobert L. Borosage, 09.02.2008When McCain is willing to sign away the principle derived from what is the defining moment of his life, then the question is: what core of character remains?Read Post | Comments (48)BIOSeth Grahame-Smith, 09.02.2008She\u0027s exactly the kind of leader America needs: the kind that will always put country first -- even if that country happens to be The Republic of Alaska.Read Post | Comments (105)BIOMichael Seitzman, 09.02.2008\"Campaigns are war!

Here\u0027s where I get off board with Sarah Palin\u0027s privacy: The baby blanket.Read Post | Comments (271)BIOBonnie Fuller, 09.02.2008The Palins took center stage with the full knowledge that their 17-year-old\u0027s five-months-along pregnancy was about to become front page news around the world.Read Post | Comments (176)BIOJacob Heilbrunn, 09.02.2008Were McCain to dump Palin overboard, the religious right would, in effect, accuse him of jilting her -- of political infidelity. McCain is hostage to Palin, and she will begin to savor it.Read Post | Comments (33)BIORobert Mackey, 09.02.2008What I can\u0027t stand for is the possibility that the first time since before 1860, there is a person of national political importance who believes that the destruction of the Union is a good idea.Read Post | Comments (73)BIOSidney Blumenthal, 09.02.2008The McCain campaign and the Bush White House negotiated terms that unfolded as a script over the past several days, several sources told me.Read Post | Comments (381)BIOBilly Kimball, 09.02.2008Obama\u0027s surrogates must not wait for the scales to fall from the public\u0027s eyes so that they see Sarah Palin as she is and find her preposterous. Democrats must tarnish her on her own terms.Read Post | Comments (95)BIOMax Blumenthal, 09.02.2008Republican luminaries including John McCain\u0027s 20-something daughter, Meghan, tried to elude my line of questioning.Read Post | Comments (85)Jermaine Dupri, 09.02.2008Seth Greenland, 09.02.2008David Quigg, 08.31.2008A.
