I have never really trusted those who are intolerant and condemning of other people\u0027s shortcomings. It makes me suspect that they are likely hiding their own.Read Post | CommentsBIOBob Cesca, 09.02.2009Political Author, Blogger, and New Media ProducerThere\u0027s no ambiguity about it. The public option is resoundingly popular, fiscally conservative and morally sound. It\u0027s centrist, it\u0027s liberal, it\u0027s conservative. Unless you don\u0027t believe in, you know, numbers.Read Post | Comments (205)BIODr. Andrew Weil, 09.02.2009Founder and director of the Arizona Center for Integrative MedicineThere is a growing trend to promote diseases to fit existing drugs. As a culture, we should be suspicious whenever we hear of a new \"disease,\" and ask whether it may just be a marketing ploy.Read Post | Comments (42)BIOMike Lux, 09.02.2009Author, The Progressive Revolution: How the Best in America Came to BeThe traditional media has talked itself into believing certain things about the fight over health care reform, whether there is any serious evidence beyond their own self-reinforcing stories or not.Read Post | Comments (18)BIORobert L. Borosage, 09.02.2009Co-Director of the Campaign for America’s FutureObama\u0027s problem isn\u0027t that he\u0027s tied himself to \"liberal leadership\" in the Congress (surely an oxymoron in the Senate). It is that he appears to be straying from the promise that swept him into office.Read Post | Comments (200)BIOLee C. Bollinger, 09.02.2009President of Columbia UniversityLike Wall Street, many of our traditional media companies are shedding jobs while the new media and technology sector is growing -- unfortunately, mostly outside of New York City.Read Post | CommentsBIOMichael Roth, 09.02.2009President, Wesleyan UniversityI don\u0027t expect Obama will satisfy those who are certain government shouldn\u0027t get bigger, or those who have no doubt that only government can address health care. But he will have made progress.Read Post | Comments (17)BIOJoseph A. Palermo, 09.02.2009Author/Associate Professor of HistoryLet\u0027s hope that when Obama speaks Congress he outlines not only a bold program to provide health care for all Americans, but also a set of proposals to lift the middle class out of its currently dismal economic condition.Read Post | CommentsBIODaniel Menaker, 09.02.2009Writer and editorAt least Ridge on the \"Rachel Maddow Show\" and \"Hardball\" had the decency to squirm, and thus give himself away. The way that he said that he didn\u0027t mean what he said showed me that he did.Read Post | CommentsBIOZack Cooper, 09.02.2009Health Economist, London School of EconomicsAmericans lost sight of why healthcare reform was vital in the first place. President Obama needs to paint a vivid, emotive picture of the need for healthcare reform.Read Post | Comments (70)BIOWilliam Bradley, 09.02.2009California-based Political Analyst NewWestNotes.comWe live in a moment of hyperpartisan politics and hyperactive media. These things militate against what the Kennedy eulogies celebrated.Read Post | CommentsBIOJames Rucker, 09.02.2009Founder of ColorOfChange.orgGreat news today -- 11 more sponsors have distanced themselves from Glenn Beck\u0027s television program, bringing the total to 57.Read Post | Comments (219)BIODavid Moore, 09.02.2009Former vice president of the Gallup Organization and managing editor of the Gallup PollWhen forced to express an opinion specifically about Obama\u0027s plan, most poll respondents will. But if permitted, they will also admit that they really don\u0027t know much about it.Read Post | Comments (33)BIOBarth Anderson, 09.02.2009Chief blogger at Fair Food FightBecause he\u0027s a professor, not a grocer, Michael Pollan can be forgiven for not understanding that the boycott is actually a \"core\" shopper revolt.Read Post | Comments (22)BIOTrey Ellis, 09.02.2009Novelist, Screenwriter, and Assistant Professor at Columbia UniversityThe most corrosive effect of Democratic passivity in response to lunatic right wing charges is to the masses. It\u0027s like watching your big, strapping dad get beat up by your scrawny weasel of a next-door neighbor.Read Post | Comments (22)BIOGabriel Rotello, 09.02.2009Gabriel Rotello is an author, journalist and documentarian living in LAIt\u0027s heartening to see that in the case of the Mt. Wilson observatory, people were willing to put their lives on the line to save a bucolic piece of living history.Read Post | CommentsBIOSteve Clemons, 09.02.2009Publisher of \"The Washington Note\"There are a lot of folks out there who are as grateful today for Obama running the nation as they were in January -- but we aren\u0027t hearing much from them of late.Read Post | Comments (195)BIOMichael Sigman, 09.02.2009Writer/ Editor, Media Consultant, Music PublisherAmazon screwed up last month when it sold Kindle users an unlicensed version of a book. The online behemoth then compounded its goof.Read Post | CommentsBIOPeter Yarrow, 09.02.2009Songwriter, founder of Operation RespectLet us sing, not to confront or protest the absence of an equitable health care system, rather to affirm our commitment to allowing all Americans the right of affordable medical care.Read Post | Comments (21)Dawn Teo, 09.02.2009Dan Dorfman, 09.02.2009Carl Jeffers, 09.02.2009Harry Moroz, 09.02.2009Lincoln Mitchell, 09.02.2009Dave Zirin, 09.02.2009Tom Doctoroff, 09.02.2009Sean Carman, 09.02.2009Jason Linkins, 09.01.2009Robert Scheer, 09.02.2009Rob Johnson and Lynn Parramore, 09.01.2009Kerry Kennedy, 09.01.2009Benjamin R.
