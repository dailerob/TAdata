{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"The big news about President Obama\u0027s fifth State of the Union speech tomorrow night is that it\u0027s going to focus on \"job creation\" and \"economic growth.\" But what\u0027s really newsworthy is less that Obama is going to focus on jobs, or that the White House is telegraphing the same, but that, with nearly 8 percent unemployment and the economy contracting in the last quarter of 2012, it\u0027s actually a news story that the president is going to focus on jobs and the economy. It\u0027s a symptom of how far both Washington\u0027s responsiveness to the economy and our expectations have fallen. But it\u0027s what comes after the speech that\u0027s important. Or, I should say, between this speech and the next one, since jobs and the economy have made regular appearances in his four previous State of the Union speeches, as well.

It\u0027s how we engage with family and friends, the way we buy products and the way we stay informed, generating billions of transactions a day, millions of times a second. What has not been as apparent, however, is just how valuable all that data can be to help small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) grow their businesses and attract new customers.Read Post | CommentsRobert Kuttner, 02/10/13Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The administration is officially committed to the idea that we need another $1.5 trillion in budget cuts over the next decade -- a rate of fiscal contraction half again as large as this year\u0027s Sequester, and for 10 full years.Read Post | Comments (614)Lucia Annunziata, 02/11/13Editorial Director, L\u0027Huffington PostWhether you are a believer or not, there can be no doubt that the pope\u0027s resignation only adds more uncertainty to the general political volatility Italy is experiencing.Read Post | Comments (107)Marty Kaplan, 02/11/13Director, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolWith Pope Benedict XVI stepping down after two terms, the race to broadcast the first head-to-head debates among potential Vatican successors has been won by CNN.Read Post | Comments (21)Jeff Schweitzer, 02/11/13Scientist and former White House Senior Policy Analyst; Ph.D. in marine biology/neurophysiologyMy thoughts when I heard Ratzinger was resigning?

But lots of questions remain.Read Post | Comments (37)Howard Fineman, 02/10/13Editorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupThe Obamas won the White House in part because of their ability to move with that studied grace and confidence through the rutted, booby-trapped landscape of race in America. In that sense, Ailey and others literally helped lay the groundwork, by showing the beauty (and not just the fear and discord) of our distinct but intertwined roots as a polyglot nation.Read Post | Comments (87)Melinda Gates, 02/11/13Co-chair, the Bill and Melinda Gates FoundationWe\u0027ve rendered the phrase \"the art and science of\" almost meaningless by using it to describe nearly any endeavor.
