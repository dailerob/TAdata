{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, the nation\u0027s eyes were on Baltimore and the protests over the death of Freddie Gray. The media, once again, focused only on the most sensationalized elements -- in this case, a CVS being looted, footage of which looped endlessly -- ignoring both the long historical context for the anger and the substance of the more representative non-violent protests. But those protesters\u0027 calls for justice were, in fact, being heard. On Friday, Baltimore City State\u0027s Attorney Marilyn Mosby charged the six officers involved in Gray\u0027s arrest with a range of crimes including murder and manslaughter. \"I\u0027ve heard your call for \u0027no justice, no peace,\u0027\" she said in announcing the charges.

When I entered Ms. Hefty\u0027s fifth-grade class at Punahou School in the fall of 1971, I was just a kid with a funny name in a new school, feeling a little out of place, hoping to fit in like anyone else.44th President of the United StatesAt a time when the supply of information seems unlimited and overwhelming, journalists and journalism are being challenged like never before. It seems contradictory, but it makes a perverse kind of sense. Despots and autocrats and terrorists are threatened by the free flow of information.Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public AffairsWhile the world talks about young people\u0027s insularity and solipsism, they\u0027re creating a fascinating and complex world of deep engagement online, a world in which they are not just watching content but becoming part of it by being community members whose comments and fanfiction and artwork and passion have profound impacts on the broader culture.I write books, including Looking for Alaska and The Fault in Our Stars.
