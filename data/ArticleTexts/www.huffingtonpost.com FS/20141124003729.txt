{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, President Obama announced the temporary halt of deportations for an estimated 4.4 million undocumented parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents. It was a welcome, if belated, move for a president who, as of April, had deported 2 million people. One might think Republicans would welcome a policy that keeps families together and rewards hard work. But the move was met with the obligatory threats of shutdowns and impeachment. \"In the days ahead, the people\u0027s House will rise to this challenge,\" thundered John Boehner. But, really, all they have to do is what President Obama suggested: simply \"pass a bill.\" If only Congress were as hardworking as the families whose lives their ugly inaction has put into limbo. Meanwhile, we lost Mike Nichols, a man who embodied the American dream: an immigrant who came here to realize his talents and left America better than he found it. Now there\u0027s a challenge to rise to.Prosecutorial discretion -- the power of the executive to determine when to enforce the law -- is one of the most well-established traditions in American law. Prosecutorial discretion is, in particular, central to the enforcement of immigration law against removable noncitizens.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoThe richest Americans hold more of the nation\u0027s wealth than they have in almost a century. What do they spend it on? As you might expect, personal jets, giant yachts, works of art, and luxury penthouses. And also on politics.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027For me, this is the ultimate homecoming, not only because this is where I and my accent were born but because HuffPost is very firmly rooted in a Greek tradition of bringing people together and facilitating interesting conversations.In 1965, for every dollar earned by the average worker, CEOs earned 20 dollars. By 2012, that gap mushroomed to 354 to one. But, when asked in the survey, Americans grossly underestimated this gap.Author, \"How to Make a Million Dollars an Hour\" (Wiley 2013)All over the country black people have been stopped, harassed, arrested, injured and even killed at the hands of the police meant to protect them. From Brooklyn to Baltimore, Atlanta to Anaheim, cellphone videos are waking up the rest of the population to the fact that overly aggressive policing is not new in America, especially in black America.Journalist; Founder, Starfish Media GroupIf Dempsey, a soldier with a long and distinguished career, cannot in good conscience preside over a military campaign he feels will be ultimately doomed, should he quietly (or noisily) resign?Senior Military Correspondent, The Huffington PostFor making a morally responsible choice -- using his discretionary legal authority to focus enforcement resources and prioritize deportations in ways that keep families together and our nation safe -- President Obama has been labeled an \"emperor\" and a \"dictator\" by Republicans.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersI am convinced that stem cell research means we Baby Boomers will be the last generation to have to watch our parents die of Alzheimer\u0027s or watch our children die prematurely of sickle cell disease. Proposition 71 set this research in motion. Now we have to make sure this research keeps moving forward.Award-winning journalist, bestselling author and activistLuckily for those who won\u0027t be returning to Congress -- the tally is 75 -- their power and influence is more sought after than ever, and many \"fail up.\" For them, the days of being lobbied are over. Now some will make the classic switch, joining the ranks of the lobbyists of K Street.Author, \"Unaccountable\"It is a common mistake to overestimate the contribution of immigration to the increase in poverty. This week\u0027s purveyor of this erroneous association is the Washington Post\u0027s Robert Samuelson, who writes in the context of a discussion about immigration reform.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorAs someone who has spent my career focused on domestic economic issues, including a stint of my own at the Treasury Department, I know how important these issues are and how much the people in Treasury can shape policies.Democratic Senator from MassachusettsIt\u0027s the same old song and dance -- corporations want more control at the expense of consumer choice and at the expense of a fair market. Net neutrality is about whether or not corporations have the right to seize this control and obtain the ability to give preferential treatment to certain websites, companies or services.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorAlthough another round of violence in Ferguson may well be inevitable, how we understand what happens there is not. It is our responsibility to ask, particularly when things get violent, who it is that has the guns, the tanks, the tear gas, and the batons. Let us not get our history of protest in America wrong one more time.Historian writing on the history, politics, and current impact of incarceration in AmericaThis is a journey we hope will include the voices of all Greeks, from the farthest-flung islands in the Aegean and Ionian Seas to the major cities to the mountain villages.Editorial Director, HuffPost GreeceEbola has taught us that our value system needs a shot in the arm. The real villain is not a virus or microbe, it is when good policies, well thought-out, are not funded or followed through.Lead singer of U2 and cofounder of ONE and (RED)I\u0027ve realized that when I give my money to companies that not only ignore the negative effects of unchecked bro-culture but actively embrace dirty tactics to get the advantage, I have become part of the problem that I am working to eradicate.Founder/CEO, APPCityLife Inc. \u0026 Cofounder, Hautepreneurs and HauteHopesThese plans can initially seem reasonable, even to progressives, many of whom are wary of the electoral college system. But this isn\u0027t a good-government plan to change the way our presidential elections are conducted. It\u0027s a targeted plot to get more electoral votes for Republicans, even when they\u0027re losing the popular vote.President, People For the American WayFor each modest step forward on climate stabilization, the latest election ensures that Americans are destined to march several steps backward when it comes to reliance on climate-altering fossil fuels. It\u0027s a recipe for good times for Big Energy and its congressional supporters and bad times for the rest of us.Author and Professor of Peace and World-Security Studies, Hampshire CollegeThere have been so many films that have touched and altered my perception over the years that I couldn\u0027t begin to single out the few that have been the most impactful, but if we only look at some of the films of the past year and the conversations, debate and change they are driving, we start to see how important and irreplaceable these films and filmmakers are.For 17 months, you have been very patient with House Republican leaders, encouraging them to either take up and pass the bipartisan Senate bill or work with you to craft a different bill.U.S. Senator from CaliforniaNinety million people worldwide watched me step onto the tennis court to defeat Bobby Riggs in the \"Battle of Sexes\" 41 years ago. Looking back, my victory was more than a point of athletic pride -- it was about social change, part of a growing movement that showed women were equal to men.Founder, Billie Jean King Leadership InitiativeThe real problem is not that we\u0027re an addiction-addled culture of oversharers, though that may indeed be true. Instead, it\u0027s that we\u0027re a culture of complainers. We complain because it\u0027s in our nature, and we\u0027re more apt to complain than to do something about it.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarWashington needs to recognize that its Pacific pivot is adding insecurity to the region, not stability. With its arms sales and encouragement of ally assertiveness, the United States is bringing peace to the region just like the Colt .45 \"Peacemaker\" brought peace to the Wild West.Director, Foreign Policy In FocusTed Cruz immediately took to Facebook and Twitter calling Net Neutrality \"Obamacare for the Internet.\" Shortly after his tantrum, the Internet erupted with cartoons, videos, and comments. After all, the Internet is full of creative people who have unfettered access to the Internet right now.Richard Zombeck is a freelance writer for hire living in the Boston area and hangs out at www.zombeckink.comEvery day, your child comes home with a story about THAT kid. You\u0027re worried that THAT child is detracting from your child\u0027s learning experience. I want to talk about THAT child, too, but there are so many things I can\u0027t tell you.Director of Early Childhood Education, Calgary French and International SchoolOpposition to Puerto Azul is widespread among Belizeans. While they support tourism -- the backbone of the country\u0027s economy -- they do not support building a resort that will irreversibly destroy the Mesoamerican reef, the very place that tourists come to experience.Actor; board member, OceanaCEO, OceanaMr. Mayor, take some of our inspiration to heart and stand with us to fight Keystone XL, to fight for New York City and to deepen our progressive values as we move into the future.Writer/director, GaslandMy interviews with middle-class Americans reveal that many are even more concerned with losing what they have than with gaining more of the same.Professor of international relations, George Washington UniversityTell us about something special that your parents or other family members did -- a meaningful tradition, ritual, lesson or gift -- that\u0027s had a lasting impact on you. You\u0027ll enjoy recalling the events as much as others enjoy reading about them, and some will be inspired enough to adopt your traditions with their own families.Senior Editor, The Huffington PostReferring to the role of the artist, he said, \"If he just follows the leader and accepts what\u0027s been done before, naturally, that can be brought to a very high skill. But if he wants to change it in some way and do it differently, then it jumps up to the major league.\" To Gene, Michael Jackson was one who made this leap.Writer, Trustee of The Gene Kelly Image TrustGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"WHAT\u0027S WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE?",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
