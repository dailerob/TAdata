{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor of Law, UCLAToday, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a landmark case challenging the constitutionality of California\u0027s ban on gay marriage. The California case, brought by Supreme Court superstars Ted Olson and David Boies, was designed from the beginning to obtain a bold, revolutionary ruling by the justices declaring gay marriage a constitutional right. If Olson and Boies -- who famously went head-to-head in the notorious Bush v. Gore case -- win, it could mean that all bans on gay marriage, everywhere in the country, will be overturned. Gay and lesbian people from Beverly Hills to Bangor will finally enjoy an equal right to marry the person they love. Yet don\u0027t count on a game-changing decision too quickly. It\u0027s more likely that Olson and Boies\u0027 blockbuster will end with a whimper.Read Post | CommentsSir Ken Robinson, 12/07/12Consultant; Author, \u0027The Element: How Finding Your Passion Changes Everything\u0027We\u0027re all born with deep natural capacities for creativity, and systems of mass education tend to suppress them.

Goodman, 12/07/12Counseling psychology Ph.D. studentStraight people benefit from gay rights. It\u0027s not a major reason to support LGBT rights (such rights stand on their own merits); it\u0027s just a fact.
