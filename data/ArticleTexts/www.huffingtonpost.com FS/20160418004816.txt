{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, the nation watched Kobe Bryant say goodbye to an historic career, while the Golden State Warriors capped a history-making season. The combatants on the other coast were less inspiring. On Tuesday, having been outmaneuvered for delegates in Louisiana and Colorado by Ted Cruz, Donald Trump accused the RNC of being \"dirty tricksters\" who should be \"ashamed of themselves.\" The next day, The Washington Post estimated that Cruz will pick up 130 to 170 delegates on a second ballot - enough to potentially deny Trump the nomination. As loudly as Trump complains, it\u0027s notable that it\u0027s in the most business-like aspects of the campaign -- deal-making -- that Trump is failing. If he can\u0027t make a deal with his own party, he\u0027ll never get that chance to make a deal forcing Mexico to pay for his wall. Meanwhile, as the Democratic candidates debated across the river from Wall Street, it was reported that five of the eight biggest banks failed to come up with credible \"living will\" plans required by Dodd-Frank. The Mamba\u0027s gone, but too-big-to-fail lives on.Today marks \"Equal Pay Day,\" the day when women\u0027s pay finally catches up to men\u0027s pay from last year. You\u0027ll have to forgive me for not cheering too loudly. Each year Equal Pay Day highlights how far we still have to go in the fight for pay equity.Actress, ActivistEmployers should take the lead by dismantling the \"all-nighter\" culture, rewarding performance by measures other than by hours logged. Staying late in the office, or firing off emails at 3AM, shouldn\u0027t be seen as a mark of success, but a warning sign.CEO, Global CitizenWhen it comes to lifelong proof that one\u0027s words matches his intentions, it\u0027s evident that Bernie Sanders is the best choice to serve as the next president of the United States -- especially for African Americans.Eldest daughter of Eric Garner, Mother, Writer, ActivistThe data doesn\u0027t lie. Silicon Valley and the tech industry have a diversity/inclusion problem. When it comes to access to capital, most investment firms and teams, and the companies that receive investment, are led by Whites.Founder and president, Rainbow/PUSH CoalitionAfter almost 20 years of marriage and 15 years of being a mom, the results of this interview warmed my heart and gave us all something we will treasure for years to come.National Public Speaker, Minister, Parenting \u0026 Education Planning ExpertSleep is a magical moment that allows us to disconnect from the world, hunger, worries, etc. Sleep is one of the last remaining mysteries in biology. We still don\u0027t understand why a typical human has to spend 25 years of life sleeping.Craig Reynolds Professor of Sleep Medicine at Stanford UniversityBreaking Barriers is a character education and literacy program that teaches students that we all face barriers in our lives, even Major League players. We help students understand the importance of character and how Jackie Robinson used his core values to overcome his barriers.Educational consultant for Major League BaseballThe mess the Republicans have got themselves into leaves them facing a likely landslide defeat regardless of whom they nominate for president. So while television, the press and party leaders focus on whether Donald Trump, Ted Cruz or a Sir Galahad to be named later emerges as their candidate, there is a greater, related question lurking.Fmr. Washington Correspondent for the New York TimesThe testing regime is destroying education.It is driven by politicians who think that tests make students smarter and by educrats who fear to think an independent thought.Research Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027Two years on, and their parents still wake up each morning not knowing whether their daughters are alive or dead, married or single or violated as slaves. They surely deserve more than a forlorn hope. The girls are now a symbol of our apparent weakness to protect young lives.Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationBecause the United States is the most powerful country in the world -- and given the state of the region -- some have second-guessed the decisions that President Obama and his Administration have made on the Middle East.U.S. Permanent Representative to the United NationsLast night, I was asked to speak at a rally for Senator Bernie Sanders as a physician and healthcare activist who supports him for president. I did not clear my prepared words with anyone in the campaign, and a portion of my speech has since generated tremendous outrage.Physician, Executive Chairman of the Courage Campaign, Healthcare ActivistOverall -- in over half a century -- the pay gap has closed by only 20 cents. Women today are paid just 79 cents for every dollar earned by a man and their median annual earnings are $10,800 less per year than men\u0027s.U.S. Representative for New York\u0027s 12th District; Ranking Democrat, Joint Economic CommitteeThe newly admitted members of the class of 2020 are now trying to decide which school will provide the best combination of resources and challenges to enable them to thrive for four years in ways that they will build on for the rest of their lives.President, Wesleyan UniversityToday we recognize Equal Pay Day, a day that symbolically represents when a woman\u0027s wage finally catches up to what a man was paid in the previous year. Despite often being equally qualified, a man\u0027s pay outpaces a woman\u0027s by 79 cents for every dollar.U.S. Representative from Illinois\u0027 8th Congressional DistrictCongressman Representing Illinois\u0027 4th District in ChicagoU.S. Representative for Illinois\u0027 5th DistrictU.S. Representative for Illinois\u0027s 9th congressional districtBoth cases involve nineteen year-olds.

One comes from one of the most impoverished communities in America.Award-Winning Author of Freestyle: Reflections on Faith, Family, Justice, and Pop Culture; Founding Pastor of Joy Tabernacle A.M.E. Church in Dallas, TexasGender-based harassment, always intersectional, is marked by the intent of the harasser to denigrate women on the basis of their sex, race, religion, gender, sexual identities or disabilities. It frequently uses violence that leverages existing real world threats that women navigate, like avoiding rape or intimate partner violence.Feminist, writer, and satirist (not always in that order)It is quite clear whose privacy and very lives are really at risk if state legislatures continue to succumb to anti-trans fear and hatred and give it state sanction.Director of the ACLU Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender \u0026 AIDS ProjectThe Broad plan, and others like it, funded by groups such as the Walton Family Foundation, are part of a coordinated national effort to decimate public schooling by rigging the system against neighborhood public schools and the students they serve.President, American Federation of TeachersMany of the Convention delegates may be in high heat and playing with the irresistible, venomous, masochistic fervor. This would be okay with the Democratic Party that would enjoy the televised spectacle of the GOP imploding. But, if cool heads are bent on rescuing the Party from the brink, here is the case they can make for Kasich.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorParents in the \u002770s defined their roles in a way we never have. I worry that our kids are leaving home with more intellectual ability than we did, but without the life skills that will give them the success and independence that we\u0027ve enjoyed.Reader, writer, and happy to be here.The Presidents Obama and Clinton were out on the links in honor of Vernon Jordan\u0027s 80th birthday. They could just as easily have been celebrating the ways in which the three of them have helped give America a trade policy that has devastated the working class but made the rich much more wealthy.Senior writer, BillMoyers.com. Former senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.Francois Hollande\u0027s pugnacity during the show leads us to the conclusion that he will fight hard to preserve his chances to run in the 2017 presidential election. He is not showing signs of giving up hope.Editorial Director, Le Huffington PostThe Brooklyn debate may not have changed any minds, but for either one of the candidates it was an excellent rehearsal for the general election debates that lie ahead. In its contentiousness the event felt more like a cross-party debate than a confrontation between ideological allies.Professor of Journalism, Northeastern University, BostonThe end of life is a part of life. It should be part of our legacy, not a desperate last-ditch effort to escape the inescapable. Talk to your family and your doctor now and on a regular basis as your condition changes. Take control of your legacy.Writer, Physician, MomDespite its positive mission, SSA has been engaging in a destructive practice that represents government not working for us, but against us. SSA has been sending, to hundreds of thousands of Social Security beneficiaries and SSI recipients, bills for what it concludes are overpayments.Founding Co-director, Social Security WorksMore big-name musicians must step forward and say: \"There\u0027s always more money, but I only have one name.

Why is it ok for abuse to go on in the modeling industry and for there not to be any laws or protections in place, but it\u0027s not alright in other industries?Former Model, Commercial Actress \u0026 Host turned Author, Speaker \u0026 Mental Health AdvocateROME -- Through the guidelines put forward in the recently released \"Amoris Laetitia\" document, Pope Francis is moving his church to be less \"uniformized\" by Rome alone and to become more pastorally plural and creative on the ground. In a nutshell, this means a less Roman and more Catholic Church.
