{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Director, USC Annenberg Innovation LabDespite the seeming chaos of our current political campaign, where \"the worst a full of passionate intensity,\" we have to see this as a transition, not a permanent condition. The deep irony is that only a true dead-ender would be willing to gamble that 30 years from today we will live in a country where non-hispanic Whites make up the majority, where coal and oil are still the dominant power sources and that America is the dominant hegemon and Wall Street rules the economy. In other words, we know the change is going to come. It\u0027s just a matter of how bitter the resistance is going to be. That is why both the Trump and Cruz campaigns are so fascinating and why a historical perspective is important.While progress is possible, it is not inevitable. If we\u0027re going to keep the promise we made in 2012, it\u0027s time to step up and get to work.Co-chair, the Bill and Melinda Gates FoundationTo create a world where Black life truly matters, we have to trust that everyone is capable, their spirit is dazzling, and they are deserving of love, no matter where they are in their life transition. To create this, we must empower and trust Black women.Reproductive justice activistThe human medical toll is steadily rising and the community-wide health risk continues -- especially for vulnerable children now facing the threat of life long brain damage from the lead contaminated water.Former SenatorThe western world has a lot of soul searching to do.

Every day that goes by is another day of mourning for humanity.PhotographerPresident Obama just had a very good month in the polls.

And how?Journalist and authorSix years on, it is time to think more long term, because a generation of young Syrians is in danger of being lost to despair, to violent extremism -- the foundations for peace in the future will erode if this reality is neglected.Director General, UNESCOAlthough the whole society benefits from widespread college education, the burden of paying for this public good has been placed directly on individuals. That\u0027s why we have proposed a bold but simple solution to the student debt problem -- to eliminate it altogether.Co-Director, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureSenior Fellow, Advanced Leadership Initiative, Harvard University. Co-founder, National Student Debt Jubilee ProjectSenior Fellow, Advanced Leadership Initiative, Harvard University. Co-Founder and President Emeritus, Presidio Graduate SchoolThis is for Trump more than anyone: If you really are smart, you would think that you need not say it, that people would notice, if people noticing it were important to you. Truly smart people rarely require the attention or recognition by others of their intelligence that Trump seems to crave.Last person on Earth not on FacebookWe cannot in good conscience fail to act now given the urgency of the problems caused by the collapse of personal accountability for Wall Street elites.

As an editor, or journalist, at what point do you say that a policy or a scheme or a venture has become successful enough to justify attention with so much else to cover? How do you avoid a good news story looking like a puff piece?Multi-award winning broadcaster ?and writer?OSLO, Norway -- Governments closing their borders to Syrian refugees often claim they help Syrians best \"in their own region.\" But it is a myth that they provide Syrian war victims with significant aid.
