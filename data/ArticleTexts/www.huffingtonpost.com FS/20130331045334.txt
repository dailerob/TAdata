{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week, the Supreme Court heard two cases on gay marriage bans -- and the long arc of the moral universe seemed to bend a bit more towards justice, as a majority of the court seemed to question the bans\u0027 constitutionality. This would put them in the good company of the majority of Americans: in a recent poll, 58 percent said they now support the freedom of gay couples to marry, a figure that skyrockets to 81 percent for those under 30, regardless of party affiliation. Change is even coming to DC, as a number of Democratic senators switched positions on the issue, and Republican Lisa Murkowski said her views are \"evolving\" -- which is, literally, what life is all about. We\u0027re not there yet, but as our nation continues our evolution toward a more perfect union, the circle of our concern grows ever wider.CommentsJim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027This Easter, when so much of the news from Washington, D.C. is bleak and inspires such little hope for the future, it is good to be reminded that more is possible than ever seems probable in our bleakest moments. The issue of immigration just might be a reminder for us all of this reality.CommentsJon RonsonJournalist, humorist, author and documentary filmmakerBecoming a psychopath-spotter can turn you a bit psychopathic because it compels you to start reducing people to items on a checklist -- to their maddest edges.Comments (490)Arianna HuffingtonI found myself moderating a panel discussion last week with the director and two cast members of a movie that uses storytelling to wake us up to one of the biggest problems of our modern age: the effect that being \"connected\" to technology 24/7 is having on our ability to connect with our lives, ourselves, and the people we love. Like so many people, this is something I struggle with on a regular basis. That\u0027s why Disconnect struck a nerve.Comments (259)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundFor years the NRA has actively fought against and prevented research on the causes and costs of gun violence. Why have we put up so long with efforts to block all research on a huge public health threat that injures and kills tens of thousands of Americans every year?Comments (1,808)Dylan RatiganNew York Times Best-Selling author and formerly the host of MSNBC\u0027s The Dylan Ratigan ShowCalifornians still do things their own way as if assistance from Washington would take too long to arrive. For a population that spends so little time looking outside for ways to do something, it is especially jarring when the scent of dysfunction blows in from the east.Comments (212)Margaret ChoComedian, actor and recording artistDan needs some paradise right now. He is on trial for contesting and questioning Don\u0027t Ask Don\u0027t Tell, which was later repealed, yet now he has to go to court, and face some possibly harsh consequences, for speaking out against it years ago.Comments (226)Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOA frail 94-year-old Nelson Mandela has again been admitted to hospital. On a prior occasion a year ago, I felt it important to write about this exceptional and unique man whose achievements should inspire many, and for a very long time. My already high respect for Mr. Mandela has only grown in the last year.CommentsThomas M. MeninoMayor of Boston; Co-chair, Mayors Against Illegal GunsAmerica\u0027s mayors know firsthand the tragic price of inaction on this issue. We\u0027re the ones who get the call at 3 a.m. after one of our police officers has been shot and killed in the line of duty, or a young person\u0027s life has been cut short by a stray bullet.Comments (319)Annette InsdorfDirector of undergraduate film studies, Columbia University, and author of PHILIP KAUFMANBlancanieves is Pablo Berger\u0027s magical Spanish transposition of the Snow White myth into the thrilling arena of bullfighting and flamenco.CommentsDonald SutherlandActorAnthony Lewis is dead. I ate his columns in the International Herald Tribune. Devoured them. Cherished them. The sensibility from which those words of his flowed filled me with hope. Fueled me with information.Comments (11)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistWhen I went on Phil Donahue\u0027s talk show in 1977, the handsome host knocked me for a loop. In the green room beforehand, he told me he wanted to talk to me about my mother (no one ever wanted to talk about my mother -- just my famous father), so I immediately knew there was something ... different about this guy.Comments (138)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesWhat took the LGBT rights movement to this moment, and indeed what has taken us to moments of truth and potential victory more often than not, are those who went against the established leaders and groups and ultimately pushed an agenda from the grassroots.Comments (274)Kareem Abdul-JabbarNBA Hall of FamerHow to approach young women in a mature and non-self-conscious way.

StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoIt is always risky to predict what the Supreme Court will do in a case based on the oral argument. Justices ask questions of the lawyers for a variety of reasons and the questions do not always reveal what the justices are actually thinking.Comments (289)Kristin ShawBlogger, TwoCannoli.comI will love you as my own daughter, if you will let me. If you\u0027re close to your mom, I am not going to try to replace her; you don\u0027t need two moms. You might, however, be interested in having a mother-in-law who might be a friend. All you have to do is ask.Comments (93)Tavis SmileyPBS talk show host, PRI radio hostSchools have literally become gateways to prison, instead of gateways to learning. When we wrapped filming, I kept thinking to myself, \"There has to be a better way.\" Thankfully, there is.Comments (166)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027What people do in their bedrooms shouldn\u0027t be the public\u0027s business. Women should have rights over their own bodies. Same-sex couples should be allowed to marry. But what powerful people do in their boardrooms is the public\u0027s business.Comments (1,045)April D. DeConickProfessor of Biblical Studies, Rice UniversityIf we are to believe the author of the Gospel of Mark, Jesus\u0027 male followers deserted him. And we know from multiple sources that Peter betrayed ever knowing him. But the women remained steadfast and faithful.Comments (126)Barry LevinsonAcademy Award-winning director, screenwriter and producerDuring the time of Jesus, there wasn\u0027t a pope, no cardinals, bishops or nuns. There was no Christianity during the time of Jesus. But things change.Comments (57)Alexis Abramson, Ph.D.Leading expert for the 50+, Baby Boomers, Caregivers and Mature Adults, www.alexisabramson.comMany years ago your mom or dad probably had \u0027the talk\u0027 with you.

Are there any grounds for holding that position beyond simple prejudice?Comments (692)Tom EngelhardtEditor, TomDispatch.comTake this April. It will be the ninth anniversary of the widespread release of the now infamous photos of torture, abuse, and humiliation from Abu Ghraib. Or to pick another anniversary that, strangely enough, goes uncelebrated here, consider the passage of the USA Patriot Act.Comments (87)LuluSinger, songwriter and performerToday at 64, I firmly believe that I am ageing victoriously, in large part due to the positive examples set by those who are ageing in the spotlight.
