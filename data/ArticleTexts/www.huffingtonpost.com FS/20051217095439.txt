{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"From infowars.comAs the holidays approach (just eight more shopping days until Christmas!), and more and more of our time and attention are absorbed by things other than politics, we’ve decided that this is the perfect time to introduce a new HuffPo feature we’re calling “Politics Aside”. This is where our bloggers will weigh in on the rest of their lives and interests. Books, movies, food, money, religion, sex, relationships, health, sports, music, travel, and much more. And you can find them gathered together by running your cursor over the Features heading on our top-of-the-page navigation bar and clicking on Politics Aside. As for me, when I put politics aside over the next few months, other than my kids I’m going to be focusing on the new book I’m writing for Little Brown, “On Becoming Fearless: Advice for Women”.

Why on God\u0027s green earth don\u0027t the Peter Paul people make a dark chocolate Almond Joy? It makes absolutely no sense.READ POST | comments12.17.2005 Susie BrightI feel guilty giving you the link to this most peculiar ministry, the Triple-X Church, which preaches against porn by copping as \"Porno\" an attitude as possible.READ POST | comments12.17.2005 Bill MaherWhen I see Hillary Clinton getting on the bandwagon with flag burning, I think she really is the worst of both worlds.READ POST | comments12.16.2005 Nora EphronSome choice words from Harold Pinter, and some others from President George W. Bush.READ POST | comments (21)12.17.2005 Meg Wolitzer and Patricia MarxPATTY: Are you going to the Gladmans’ party? [NSA: “Gladman”: Same number of letters as Osama, plus 2. Also, “party”: possibly Dems? Link to Hillary? Note: Arrest Gladmans?]READ POST | comments12.16.2005 Paul KrassnerIn desperately trying to appeal to an irrational mindset by criminalizing flag-burning, an act that harms no one, Hillary Clinton is also placing the First Amendment on the back burner.READ POST | comments12.17.2005 Jake ReinerWhen I heard that former San Francisco Giants assistant GM Ned Colletti was the new Dodger general manager, I was shocked to say the least.READ POST | comments12.17.2005 Ian UrbinaCriticizing something for being passive-aggressive is like faulting a tactic for being discreet. Just as there are times when subtlety is the worst approach, there are also times when passive aggression is the best.READ POST12.16.2005 David SirotaThe Republicans are capitalizing not on Democrats who are concrete in their support of an exit strategy, but on the Democrats who try to have it both ways.READ POST | comments (27)12.17.2005 Patricia ZohnThere are those who will always prefer to be with their own kind, never venturing forth from their backyards. I live in Los Angeles precisely to avoid that kind of insularity.READ POST12.17.2005 Leonard ShlainThe polarized events playing out today, with each side\u0027s clarion calls to a stricter fundamentalist intolerance, are a speeded-up replay of what transpired five hundred years ago.READ POST12.16.2005 Stephen SchlesingerNow we have learned the latest horror from the Bush Administration. Does one smell a whiff of fascism in Washington these days?READ POST | comments (80)12.16.2005 Martin GarbusToday, for two separate reasons, has been an incredible day in America. First, the United States has legitimized torture and secondly, the President has admitted to an impeachable offense.READ POST | comments (69)12.16.2005 RJ EskowThe Times\u0027 reputation has been sullied by the Judith Miller incident and by the false stories it published that helped lead us into war. It needs to act quickly to defend its credibility in this story.READ POST | comments (35)12.16.2005 Harry ShearerThe discovery, made weeks ago by three independent investigations, of \"design and construction flaws\" in the New Orleans levee system is now being attributed to \"administration officials.\"READ POST | comments12.16.2005 Norman LearSo tell me Lord: In the Bible, you were known to test societies by forcing them to endure tribulations for seven years. Does this mean that we have only two more years to go?READ POST | comments (59)12.16.2005 Deepak ChopraNow that punishing all evil-doers to the absolute maximum is the most Christian thing to do, we can all rest easy. Jesus\u0027s most radical ideas have been washed clean from our memories and our conscience.READ POST | comments (71)12.16.2005 Marty KaplanDoug Bandow, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute who\u0027s also a syndicated columnist for the Copley News Service, has been on the take for years.
