{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editorial Director, AOL Huffington Post Media GroupVeep vetting is going public -- even viral -- which means a decision Mitt Romney thought he was making in private could be influenced, or undermined, by a parallel search going on beyond his headquarters in Boston. Until now the process of researching the background of potential vice-presidential running mates was largely left to campaign lawyers conducting secret interviews and poring over stacks of documents and disclosure forms in windowless offices. But as the Romney campaign has developed its short list, a crowd-sourcing mini-industry has sprung up on the web to dig into that list and feed the results back to the public and/or the Obama campaign. If you\u0027re Mitt, you\u0027ll want to make sure you know what the crowd knows.Read Post | Comments (76)Robert L.

But baby, we are growing in two different directions.

Whitney and Gregory A. Prince, Ph.D., 08/09/12Considerable attention has been devoted to Mitt Romney\u0027s tax returns and his former company\u0027s \"job-creating performance,\" but there has been insufficient discussion about what arguably has had the greatest role in shaping who he is and how he views the world: his Mormon religion.Read Post | Comments (474)Richard A. Clarke, 08/09/12Former Advisor to the President on Cyber SecurityDespite the warnings of generals, intelligence officers, corporate cyber security experts, and academic experts that America is dangerously vulnerable to attack in cyberspace, John McCain and the right wing Chamber of Commerce succeeded in blocking Senate action to improve our ability to defend America against cyber attack.Read Post | Comments (124)Laurie Gerber, 08/09/12President of Handel Group Life CoachingI believe we were meant to be happy.
