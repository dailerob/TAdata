{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"APAPFrom thinkprogress.orgFrom yahoo.comPoor Tony Snow. With the GOP message machine breaking down, he\u0027s had quite a week. First he had to explain how President Bush never said \"stay the course\" despite all those listings on \"The Google\" that prove he did. Next, he had to explain how Vice President Cheney hadn\u0027t really confirmed that detainees were waterboarded despite that interview in which Cheney called the torture technique a \"no-brainer.\" Finally, he was forced to keep a straight face while trying to make the case that those race-baiting RNC ads in Tennessee were \"a little bit cute.\" What next, an explanation of why Rush Limbaugh\u0027s attacks on Michael J. Fox were \"totally adorable\"? He left the \"Fair and Balanced\" network for this?
