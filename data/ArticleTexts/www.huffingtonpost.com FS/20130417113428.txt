{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonBREAKING! This just in: the economy is terrible and the country is suffering its worst jobs crisis since the Depression... developing... Of course, this isn\u0027t actually breaking news, it\u0027s aching news -- and before the tragic bombings in Boston, the most important story going on. But you wouldn\u0027t have known that if you\u0027d been listening to the media, where the long-term jobs disaster that\u0027s been enveloping the country for five years goes virtually unmentioned. Only 88,000 new jobs were produced last month. And for the long-term unemployed, the situation is verging on hopeless. It\u0027s hard to imagine our jobs disaster will get the attention -- and the solutions -- it deserves if our media doesn\u0027t think it\u0027s a story worth telling. Perhaps we need to come up with an alternate term to the breathless \"BREAKING\" tag. How about \"BROKEN\"?Comments (101)Jamie Lee CurtisActress and children\u0027s book authorApril 15 now so sadly known for both. One a privilege for living in a free county, the other perhaps a price.Comments (78)Brian Levin, J.D.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityWhile there is significant speculation about the meaning of the date and location of yesterday\u0027s horrific terror attack at the Boston marathon that killed 3 and injured over 170, physical evidence will yield some of the most important clues. One of the most important clues is a bomb\u0027s signature.Comments (43)Hannah Kathryn DeYoungSophomore, Northeastern UniversityAt first I just felt the impact go through my body. Runners ducked and asked \"What was that?\" as they swiveled towards the finish line. A pillar of smoke stretched into the air, but with hundreds of runners between me and the explosion I could not see who it had impacted.Comments (14)Paul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostI can see it on the streets of New York, and online on the social networks -- we are angry and want a response to Boston. The question we face now as individuals and as a nation is what to do with our anger.Comments (277)Daniel Arrigg KohChief of Staff to Arianna HuffingtonWe will never understand why anyone would want to commit such tragedy. But there\u0027s one thing that\u0027s clear -- they won\u0027t mess with our Marathon. Bostonians will never allow it. Next year, the runners will be even more determined, and the crowds will be larger. It\u0027s in our spirit -- and it\u0027s unbreakable.Comments (19)Patton OswaltComedian and writer who lives and drinks in Los AngelesThe vast majority stands against that darkness and, like white blood cells attacking a virus, they dilute and weaken and eventually wash away the evildoers and, more importantly, the damage they wreak.Comments (612)Alyson SchaferParenting expertThe bombings at the finish line of the Boston Marathon has rocked the nation. Many children overheard their parents talking about it, or caught a glance of the news coverage. How does a parent effectively discuss the event?Comments (52)Michael LevinNYT Bestselling Author, EntrepreneurI was at mile 17 of the Boston Marathon when a runner looked up from her cellphone and said, in disbelief, a bomb went off at the finish line.Comments (38)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorI just read that Goldman Sachs posted a profit of $2.2 billion in the first quarter, \"... driven by strength in its investment banking business as well as its investing and lending unit.\" And they\u0027re mere pikers compared to their banking brethren.Comments (39)Alana HorowitzFront Page Editor, The Huffington PostPeople, runners and non-runners alike, can take much more than we think we can. We can go on even when our legs are throbbing and our hearts are broken. This horrific day of events will not falter the stamina of America\u0027s collective courage. We will only finish stronger.Comments (11)Ruben BollingCartoonist, \u0027Tom the Dancing Bug\u0027We can\u0027t pretend that when this happens to us it was caused by boogie men who crawled out of a crevice in the earth. They didn\u0027t do it in spite of their humanity, they did it because of their humanity -- the very worst side of it.Comments (35)Craig KanalleySenior Editor, Big News \u0026 Live Events, The Huffington PostWe\u0027ve all been there. You start typing something on social media, you\u0027re about to post it, then you think better of it. Or at least many of us have been there, according to a new study.Comments (31)Tavis SmileyPBS talk show host, PRI radio hostHarrison Ford reflects on the importance of America coming to terms with racial reconciliation and the humanity and particular genius of black fellow citizens.CommentsRichard (RJ) EskowWriter; host, \u0027The Breakdown\u0027; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureThe people of Boston walked the next mile, the 27th Mile. And after the smoke cleared they chose to walk it together, not alone. They looked into that handful of dust and saw hope, not fear.CommentsHoward FinemanEditorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupIn the end, the terrorists will fail because Bostonians did not turn from their fellow men -- they turned toward them. And that is the real music of mankind.Comments (290)Malu HalasaEditor and writer in LondonBy the former headquarters of the BBC World Service in Bush House and the London School of Economics there will be echoes from the past of some of the harshest criticism against Thatcher policies that criminalized the poor and dissolved the unions.CommentsBrad HarringtonExecutive Director, Boston College Center for Work \u0026 Family and Research Professor in the Carroll School of Management www.bc.edu/cwf @BCCWFI remember my father lifting me up so I could look straight down as the elite runners finished. That April day in the 1960\u0027s, my love affair with the Boston Marathon began.CommentsBianca JaggerFounder and Chair, Bianca Jagger Human Rights FoundationThe trampling of indigenous rights, military force used against protesters, impunity, megadams and environmental destruction. Is Brazil returning to the bad old days?Comments (33)Anne Taylor FlemingNovelist, commentator and essayistWe have so many questions now and not a lot of answers. We are the can-do guys, tall in the saddle, ready to fight for freedom. But this enemy is shadowy, popping up here and there -- this time in the middle of a bright spring day on the streets of Boston. Where next?CommentsRafa VegaSports JournalistAt that moment my quadriceps were burning from their exertions and I was lamenting that today wasn\u0027t going to be my day -- I wasn\u0027t going to meet the time I\u0027d set for myself. My thoughts were interrupted by a dry, metallic sound. Immediately afterwards, another one. Chaos followed.CommentsJeremiah GoulkaWriter\"Duration of the disturbance,\" says the manual, \"is more than 1 month.\" I look at my colleague\u0027s wall calendar. It\u0027s 29 days since I left Iraq and the nightmares have stopped, so I don\u0027t have PTSD. Or at least I\u0027m not diagnosable. I feel a wash of relief.CommentsKenny YumManaging Editor, The Huffington Post Canada/AOL CanadaWhen I heard about bombs and Boston, it was a shock to the system. I know more than several runners down there and I\u0027ve literally been in their shoes, struggling down that final straightaway. The finish of the Boston Marathon is the happiest place for a runner, where dreams are fulfilled.CommentsJill SaftelSports editor, The Huntington NewsMarathon Monday is a sacred day in Boston, nothing short of a holiday. Most of the city\u0027s residents have the day off, families flock to the race route to cheer runners on, enjoy Boston, and take in what\u0027s usually among the first days of spring.CommentsJayson LuskProfessor and Willard Sparks Endowed Chair, Department of Agricultural Economics, Oklahoma State UniversityEverywhere you turn, you hear \"organic is healthier,\" \"organic is greener\" or \"you absolutely MUST buy organic.\" It\u0027s not a question of whether we want to eat healthy, environmentally friendly food -- who doesn\u0027t want that?Comments (284)Christina HuffingtonI was having trouble breathing. \"Am I going to be okay?\" I asked the nurse who was monitoring my heart rate. \"I don\u0027t know,\" she said. \"If you are, I hope you stop destroying your life.\" It was not the first time substance abuse had landed me in the emergency room. But, though I didn\u0027t know it then, it would be my last.Comments (404)Angela Onwuachi-WilligCharles and Marion Kierscht Professor, University of Iowa College of LawThis month presents an opportune moment to reflect upon what guidance Dr. King\u0027s poignant words can offer our society in addressing what some have called \"the new civil rights movement\": the same-sex marriage movement.Comments (14)Blake Kernen7th grader from New Jersey, founder of peaceloveprofits.com, authorSo there\u0027s no doubt about it: Girl Scouts sell a ton of cookies each year, but that\u0027s really not their most important product. Girl power is, and if you\u0027re familiar at all with the Girl Scout program, you know there\u0027s plenty of this to go around.CommentsRev. Emily C. HeathClergy, United Church of ChristNo matter what we learn about the who or the why of what happened today, I choose to believe that in the end \"perfect love casts out fear.\" In our hearts. In our minds. And on that one city block in the heart of Boston.Comments (284)Judith Natelli McLaughlinPoet, author, lover of wordsI grew up in the 1970s. I didn\u0027t wear a bike helmet. I didn\u0027t even own a bike helmet. I am not certain if manufacturers made them for my type of social, local biking. I biked all over town, helmet-free, hair blowing in the wind, thinking nothing of it.Comments (119)Jennifer James and Jill SheffieldMost of us can think back on the precise moment or person who has affected our life\u0027s work. A week in Kenya did it for me. I came back to the States with an immense fire to lend my voice to women and mothers who are often voiceless.CommentsAnn Brenoff, 2013.17.04Rev. Gary R.
