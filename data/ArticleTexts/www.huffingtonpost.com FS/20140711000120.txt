{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Author of a dozen books, including \u0027The End of Nature\u0027 and \u0027Deep Economy\u0027If we are going to make the transformative change away from fossil fuel, we need thousands of institutions and millions of individuals to make the same choice that Tom Steyer and the World Council of Churches and the University of Dayton trustees made: to look at the emerging science and to understand that we can\u0027t go on as we did before. What used to be okay no longer is. Hypocrisy is when you say one thing and do another at the same time. Growth is when you weigh new information and then change your thinking and behavior.The never-ending war in Iraq and the birth of the newly declared Islamic State -- the first caliphate since the fall of the Ottoman Empire -- are the unintended consequences of a set of crudely forged intelligence documents we collectively call The Italian Letter.Author, \u0027The Italian Letter: The Forgery That Started The Iraq War\u0027Once upon a time, if a character on TV or in a movie tortured someone, it was a sure sign that he was a bad guy. Now, the torturers are the all-American heroes. We\u0027re not only living in a post-9/11 world, we\u0027re stuck with Jack Bauer in the 25th hour.Author, \u0027Mainstreaming Torture\u0027Summertime reading recommendations are usually about escapism -- mysteries, thrillers, melodramas, romances -- meant to stand in for vacations from our everyday lives. But I\u0027d like to add a different sort of book to your summer reading queue. While it\u0027s not escapism, it is about a departure from our everyday work lives. I\u0027m talking about The Alliance: Managing Talent in the Networked Age by Reid Hoffman, Ben Casnocha and Chris Yeh.A just war must have a just end, and the just end must be sufficiently good to more than compensate for all injustices caused by the war. There is no plausible story that Netanyahu\u0027s war is a just war.Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicyCompanies spend millions of dollars to make their products look ideal to consumers. But what if they stripped all of that away and told the truth?Graphic DesignerIt\u0027s against the law to buy $28 billion of cocaine and it\u0027s against the law to hire illegal immigrants to pick our crops, but we do both. It\u0027s time to face the reality that we\u0027ve caused the border crisis.Author and Journalist published in Salon.com, the Jerusalem Post, Chicago Tribune, The Hill\u0027s Congress Blog, and other publications.My mom would always say there\u0027s a simple fix for making someone feel included and showing respect -- it\u0027s as easy as using a different word.Actress, model, Special Olympics AmbassadorI know what it\u0027s like to lose your childhood to war. When I was five and conflict raged in Sudan, my family and I were amongst the lucky ones to leave for Egypt. Four years later we were granted asylum in the United Kingdom. Inspired by legendary South Sudanese basketball player Manute Bol, my siblings and I took up basketball which helped us fit in.NBA and Great Britain basketball player, founder of the Luol Deng FoundationWhatever little remained of the \"compassionate conservatism\" championed by George W. Bush has long since evaporated under the heat of Republican extremism. Today, more than three-quarters of American conservatives think the poor \"have it easy.\"Professor Emeritus, Union Institute \u0026 UniversityThe cold-blooded murders of the three abducted Israeli boys must not go unpunished. But justice, not vengeance, should win the day. The murderers should be tracked down, apprehended and tried in court for their crimes.JournalistAlthough news headlines often glibly refer to a \"war on women\" in political terms, policymakers might well devote more energy to sex trafficking -- a nightmarish war faced by the most vulnerable among us, young women who are being bought and sold for sex against their will.U.S. Senator for the State of MississippiSince the middle of May, Nicole and several of the other Sandy Hook family members have called your office multiple times a week requesting a meeting to discuss an important piece of legislation -- legislation that if passed, could prevent a similar tragedy or lessen the loss of life. You ignored them at every turn.Chief Creative Officer, IDThe top five oil and gas companies alone made over $1 trillion in the past decade. That\u0027s over $250 million per day. The fossil fuel industry is destroying the planet with impunity and getting rich while doing it. That must end.Independent U.S. Senator from VermontWhite nationalists from the League of the South -- the premier neo-Confederate group -- are hailing the recent Republican primary victory of Maryland\u0027s Michael Peroutka -- who won his party\u0027s nomination in an Anne Arundel County Council race, as well as a seat on the GOP Central Committee there -- as \"a political victory for us.\"Communications strategist based in Washington, D.C.Zangeif got in a work-release program. This meant that he was allowed to work while in jail. At every shift, I drove to his restaurant and had sneaky makeout sessions with him. I\u0027d be lying if I said that his sentence provided no additional thrill -- defiance is hot.sex, science, style (and everything else that turns you on)We need to take a moment to reflect on the state of our laws around \"sexting.\" And we need to consider the crazy mixed messages we are sending our teens about sexual behavior in our digital world.CEO, Family Online Safety InstituteLast month, United Negro College Fund President Michael Lomax announced that his organization has received a $25-million grant from the billionaire industrialist Koch brothers, who also fund efforts to suppress voters\u0027 rights and workers\u0027 rights. I sent the following letter to Lomax on July 8.President, American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIOThe phrase \"if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is\" is often overused but it certainly rings true with dietary supplement and weight loss advertisements -- be it on TV, in print, on the radio or on the Internet.Executive Director of TrustInAds.orgIn his broadside against President Obama, Dick Cheney fails to grasp the central irony of his situation. Cheney wants us to respond to his cries of \"fire,\" but does not understand that all we see when he speaks is the arsonist.President, Fiscal Strategies GroupLike everyone, appearing smart during meetings is my top priority. Sometimes this can be difficult if you start daydreaming about your next vacation, your next nap, or bacon. When this happens, it\u0027s good to have some fallback tricks to fall back on.Writer, comedian and accomplished pedestrian living in NYCThe simple fact is that absent government regulation and collective bargaining agreements, the market by itself does not assure that everyone shares in the fruits of society\u0027s increased economic productivity. In fact, we know that just the opposite is true.Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersEarth system science provides the fundamental evidence base for humanity\u0027s decisions, but the fact is that we know far more about the functioning of our economy than about the planet.Executive Director, Columbia University\u0027s Earth InstituteOn average, one out of every 25 Death Row inmates are innocent. In developing The Divide, premiering July 16 on WEtv, our attempt to portray their stories as well as those dedicated to the Innocence Project has been a humbling experience.Executive Producer and Co-Creator, “The Divide\"Under the brightest of lights imaginable and with the eyes of the world square upon them, perennial juggernauts Germany and Argentina are set to square off in a mouthwatering World Cup Final at the Maracana stadium in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday.Writer, The Beautiful GameHave you ever been in a conversation and realized you weren\u0027t connecting? You were making perfect sense, but the other person just wasn\u0027t getting it. Wasn\u0027t getting you.Author, \u0027Never Be Closing\u0027Author, \u0027Never Be Closing\u0027We\u0027ve all heard it: \"Aw, Mom, chicken again?\" Show your family that chicken doesn\u0027t have to be boring.Once Upon a ChefOur relationship used to be a give and take. But from now on, this relationship is a one-way street. I own you for all the great things you can bring my life, but you don\u0027t own me in return. I will look up. I will stop. I\u0027ve got to re-engage in the world instead of feeling engaged to you.Emmy® award-winning journalist and “Talk Stoop” hostThis aspect of school reform has been lurking around the edges for some time-- the notion that once we find the super-duper teachers, we could somehow shuffle everybody around and put the supery-duperest in front of the neediest students.Teacher, writer, blogger at curmudgucationAn enormous gap has emerged about what liberty means today. The debate drives vastly different visions of where the country is headed. What should unite us, divides us. Unnecessarily, as it turns out. There\u0027s common ground if we want to find it.Senior Fellow, DemosSummer is here. There will be barbecues. Sand will find its way into the strangest places. Your family, extended family, kids\u0027 friends and friends of friends -- even complete strangers -- will sail in and out of your home.
