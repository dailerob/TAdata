You never know where an interesting link might take you -- or where you may come across compelling content. That\u0027s why we\u0027ve put a lot of work into making it possible to access HuffPost on other sites where you may spend a lot of your online time -- and why I\u0027m excited about the new app our tech team has developed that allows Yahoo! users to keep up with HuffPost without having to leave their Yahoo! homepage. It\u0027s a cool tool that lets you quickly flip through all our different sections and preview the latest posts from our top bloggers. And that\u0027s just one of the ways we\u0027ve synced up HuffPost and Yahoo!.
