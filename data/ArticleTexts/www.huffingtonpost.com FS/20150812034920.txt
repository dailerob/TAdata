{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Founder and president, Rainbow/PUSH CoalitionExcessive force puts white lives at risk, as well as those of blacks and Hispanics. But the silence of the white community and of the white church is deafening. The victims of police abuse are left to seek justice on their own. We need people of conscience in the white community to join with the growing movement grounded in the African-American community to demand reform. People of all races and all incomes care about safe streets. They want their children protected; their parents able to walk outside with security. One year after Ferguson, it\u0027s clear we all have a stake in dramatic reform of the American way of policing, if the police are to be trusted as protectors and not threats.I want to run. But I want to run to be a different kind of president. \"Different\" not in the traditional political puffery sense of that term. \"Different,\" quite literally. I want to run to build a mandate for the fundamental change that our democracy desperately needs.Author, \u0027Republic, Lost\u0027; Founder, RootstrikersPreventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon is one of the most important objectives of our national security policy. While the agreement is by no means perfect, I have concluded that it is our best available option to put the brakes on Iran\u0027s development of a nuclear weapon and that is why I will support it.U.S. Senator from MinnesotaFor as long as I can remember, I\u0027ve hidden myself. I definitely started hiding when I got old enough to walk down my NY streets alone. I became comfortable hiding my intelligence, my physical appearance, my truths, my thoughts, myself. But just the other day it hit me: Alicia! Why are you choosing to be that person?Singer, songwriter, AIDS activist, philanthropistLike all animals, we are information seeking creatures, using our senses to navigate our environments. But we will find ourselves mistaken and confused if we focus too much attention on words and ideas and not enough on the amazing wealth of information our bodies are sending and receiving.Psychotherapist; Executive/life coachOur community has been divided for decades. We continue to be divided on many issues. But on this issue, we all agree. It\u0027s a matter of war and peace, and peace is the obvious choice. It\u0027s a no brainer. The nuclear deal is on the right side of history.President, National Iranian American CouncilIt is clear to me that what happened at the rally is one small result of centuries of racism. As a country, we still have not recognized or acknowledged what we have wrought, and what we continue to inflict, on black people.Washington State Senator representing the 37th Legislative DistrictThe Watts Riots took place fifty years ago, but I remember them vividly. I was thirteen years old, and on the morning of August 12, 1968, I woke up at Pepperdine University where I stayed the night for church camp.Congresswoman representing California\u0027s 44th districtOpponents of the Iran deal have been unable to produce a viable alternative. That is because there really are no alternatives left. Should the Iran deal collapse under the weight of spoilers like Schumer, Iran will get a nuclear weapon. And once Iran achieves and announces that capability to the world, no expert will be able to foresee the consequences.Founding Editor, Nortia PressIt still hasn\u0027t hit me. I\u0027m living my dream and I look forward to continuing to work hard towards becoming a better, stronger dancer. Now that we\u0027re here, my hope is that in time, this won\u0027t be such a rare achievement, and my reviews and mentions in the media will refer to me simply as a \"ballerina,\" because that\u0027s what I am.Principal Dancer, American Ballet TheatreThe filmmakers may be scrambling in post-production to try to fix all of the issues people see with the film, but it\u0027s unlikely they will manage to fix the most egregious errors.Writer, thinker, social drinker.Despite all the social and economic progress since the events in Watts, and after the civil unrest that followed the Rodney King beating trial verdicts, it seems the more things change, the more they remain the same.Supervisor for the Second District in Los Angeles CountyMore than five years after the passage of Dodd-Frank the SEC finally issued rules on disclosure of CEO pay last week. This is useful information for trends in inequality. Corporate lobbyists have spent the last five years complaining that this disclosure would impose an enormous burden.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Netanyahu and his coalition know they\u0027re losing the American Jewish community, and they are very aware they\u0027re losing the rest of the world as well. The possibility of a UN effort to resolve the conflict has never been greater, nor has the American willingness to pursue it.Executive Director, Gender Rights MarylandAll of us are invited to a lot of parties, even really fun ones. However, we almost never get to witness and participate in rituals that focus on the love, hope and commitment represented by a wedding.Executive Editor Of Global Spirituality and Religion, The Huffington PostThe importance of an antiwar movement that refused to stand down can\u0027t be emphasized too strongly. Its refusal to shut up brought Vietnam, both literally and figuratively, to America\u0027s doorstep. It made a grim war a living (and dying) presence in American lives.Editor, TomDispatch.comRepublican candidates convened last night for the first debates of the 2016 campaign. The presidential hopefuls disagreed on all but one topic: the controversy over the recent release of an undercover video with Planned Parenthood.Associate Professor of Law, University of San DiegoI watched the first year of my daughter\u0027s life underwater. (It was like holding my eyes open in an overly-chlorinated public pool. I could feel the phantom chemicals sting my corneas.) I choked back tears while she choked down Cheerios, butternut squash and breast milkMother, writer, distance runner, wife and creator of Sunshine Spoils MilkThe entire political punditry world has been holding its collective breath since last Thursday night, waiting for some polling numbers to interpret. But one question in particular seems to show some very bad news for the Republican Party.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comFostering isn\u0027t just good for the dog -- it can do wonders for the human as well! A dog needs daily exercise, and that helps us to get up, get out of the house, and experience simplicity.Best-selling author, public speaker, and the internationally acclaimed star of “Cesar 911\" on Nat Geo WILD.\"Is that your hair?\" This was not, by any means, the first time I had been asked this. I get it quite often. I always answer truthfully, although it always baffles me why people don\u0027t think of this as a rude question to ask someone.Daughter of the twin isle of Trinidad and TobagoIf you have seen Kendrick Lamar\u0027s latest music video, \"Alright,\" then you know it is arguably one of the most epic music videos of all time. Lamar\u0027s \"Alright\" gives you a lift of hope in the midst of perpetual antipathy for black and brown human lives in our world today.Minister, student, and activistWe can debate whether it is good or bad, but these are the new rules of work. Everything changed over the last decade as we became chained to the Internet. These changes are happening globally.Academic, Researcher, Writer, EntrepreneurIn the Information Age, technology is revolutionizing all aspects of society including business, shopping, finance, and entertainment. But health care is the last remaining outpost.Public Health Editor, The Huffington Post; Former U.S. Assistant Surgeon GeneralFifty years later, Americans of all races and incomes must look back at the upheaval that started in Watts with new eyes and face the warnings all around us that our progress has not been sufficient, and that we are slipping into racial division that could once again lead to hatred and violence.President, Partnership for Sustainable Communities; author, \u0027Rebuilding a Dream: America’s New Urban Crisis, the Housing Cost Explosion, and How We Can Reinvent the American Dream for All\u0027Black Lives Matter protesters wanted Sanders\u0027 campaign to stop treating racial justice as an inevitable byproduct of economic justice. They wanted Sanders to instead promote a specific racial justice platform complementary to his economic justice agenda, and they had every right to demand that he do so.34Justice co-founder and bloggerWomen know about blood. We know about discharge. We know about babies, and many of us also love them, their little feet and hands and eyelashes.Combining the beauty of a high-end fashion magazine with the dynamic energy of the webWhile the rest of the country\u0027s political class frets about how to reduce the prison population, Police Commissioner Bill Bratton wants more people in jail, going back to the future with the 1990s-era super-predation myths.Social Worker and JournalistThat can\u0027t be my dad. He was at my house two days earlier, bringing my daughter a present for her ninth birthday. You don\u0027t do that if you\u0027re about to end your life, do you? And he hugged me goodbye. Did he know then that was the last time he\u0027d ever hug me? I sure didn\u0027t.TV Writer. Emotional Eater.Black Lives Matter is a noble organization that has brought much needed attention to profound issues; however, recent protests ignore the fact that Clinton\u0027s political career runs contrary to many of the organization\u0027s stated objectives.Columnist and author published in The Hill, The Baltimore Sun, The Jerusalem Post, Salon, and other publicationsI\u0027m happy to see that Netflix is joining our new world.
