But these admirable responses, solidarity and resolution, moral clarity and decisiveness, can be treacherous. Terrorism, like an auto-immune disorder, hijacks society\u0027s self-defense mechanisms to terribly destructive ends. I don\u0027t mean the familiar observation that terrorists take advantage of an open society\u0027s mobility, privacy, and anonymity -- qualities that have, in fact, been significantly curtailed in the last thirteen-plus years. No, terror\u0027s more basic and ironic ally is the compulsion to sense-making, the appetite for meaning, that has been on display in the moving responses to the Paris massacre.If the now ubiquitous sign reads \"I am Charlie,\" in the authorship and the parody on its face value, Charlie, in its own grief, is also saying: \"We are you.\"Publisher of the visual politics and media literacy site, BagNewsNotesThese men of murder are the symptom of a creed that lies as far away from God as is possible to conceive and do not represent Islam anymore than George Bush, Tony Blair and Halliburton represented Christianity, or ordinary, secular Europeans and Americans when they profited from the bombing of innocent Iraqis.Actor and comedianWhat if we refused to allow January to shame us into feelings of inadequacy? What if we took a cue from toddlers everywhere and turned up our noses at what January was serving us?Mother, Wife, Blogger, mamabythebay.comBetween the New Deal and the 1970s, Wall Street was tightly controlled. Taxes on the wealthy were high, worker wages were rising, and debt levels on consumers, companies and government were low. After finance wriggled free from these regulations private and public debt exploded, wages stalled, taxes on the rich fell and inequality soared.Author, \"How to Make a Million Dollars an Hour\" (Wiley 2013)I’m not yet ready to live in a world where everything is connected. I don\u0027t want to see ads gleaned from information about my sleep patterns and what I\u0027ve been cooking -- and I\u0027m not convinced all the companies betting on this future are motivated by my best interests.Technology reporter, The Huffington PostVegas threw me a rope and I grabbed it with both hands, and legs, and all the strength of someone stuck in a hole would need to get out. Now, as I resurface into the world, the light is so bright I can hardly see. It\u0027s like being born again.Editor, Mamapedia.comSocial Security is a critical issue for Americans. The Republicans\u0027 unexpectedly fierce attacks on it offer the president an opportunity to set the political tone for the next two years.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourThe assumption that an openly sexual woman is objectifying herself or being controlled and consumerized by the man in her life is preposterous, at best.Journalist. Storyteller. Wordsmith. Tar Heel. Black Feminist. In no particular order.All in all, ever since his forceful response to the midterm elections, Obama seems to be getting more and more popular. In absolute numbers, of course, Obama still has a long way to go.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comAs a poet and storyteller, I have dedicated my life\u0027s work to understanding that emotional embargo -- that invisible Berlin Wall across the straits between Cuba and Florida.Presidential Inaugural PoetHaving followed all of the rules, I had become simultaneously desirable and unattainable. This, dear friends, is the great contradiction of my generation.mater mea celebrates women of color at the intersection of career and family.It sounded like a good idea back in 2000. Two decades after the Cold War ended, the United States and Russia each agreed to dispose of 34 metric tons of weapons-grade plutonium -- enough for about 20,000 warheads -- by combining most of it with uranium to create mixed-oxide fuel for commercial nuclear reactors.Senior Writer, Union of Concerned ScientistsThe moment more fans reject that paradigm and hold the league accountable will be the moment things will finally change for the better. In a more diverse and tolerant America that increasingly rejects for-profit bigotry, that moment is coming sooner rather than later.Oneida Indian Nation Representative; CEO, Oneida Nation EnterprisesIt is one thing to travel to France and demonstrate solidarity with the French people after the horrific execution of 12 journalists at the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo; it is an entirely different matter to use the occasion to call on French Jews to immigrate to Israel to avoid anti-Semitism and \"live secure and peaceful lives.\"Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUCalifornia Democrats are blessed to have a deep bench of talent, and I will decide soon based on what I think is the best way to continue the hard work we\u0027ve already started together to prevent climate disaster and preserve American prosperity.California Philanthropist \u0026 Climate ChampionThanks in part to new mandates from the federal government, colleges and universities are more proactive about sexual violence than they were when I started school. Yet the quality of self-defense programs have not improved nearly enough.Executive Director, IMPACT BostonRep. Chris Van Hollen has just introduced another approach, a bold, far-reaching one that goes directly at the problem by providing a significant tax credit to middle and upper-middle-class families, along with a spate of other benefits, paid for largely by taxing those at the top of the income scale.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorYou may conclude, as many have done on social media, that this is due to inherent racial biases of Western media. However, your anger at Western media for the lack of coverage on the massacre in Baga is misplaced. Here\u0027s why.Nigerian American journalist; Co-Founder, CompareAfrique.comConstantly defending and justifying your dreams and desires is not only exhausting, but also counterproductive and unhealthy. Take the time to actively seek out like-minded people who will acknowledge, affirm and celebrate your audacious goals.Business \u0026 Leadership Strategist. www.jamiyoung.comWhen it comes to bucket lists, seeing the Northern Lights normally sits pretty high up, but not everyone can find the time to trek far into the north to catch a glimpse.

This work was done in mid-August in Paris and Lyon, Toronto, New York, San Francisco, London, and Madrid.Author, \"The Athena Doctrine: How Women (And The Men Who Think Like Them) Will Rule The Future\"It can add its unique profile to everything from an Old Fashioned to a Lemon Drop to a tiki drink.Liquor.comJournalists will hopefully be able to do their jobs without the ongoing threat of being incarcerated solely for reporting and expressing critical opinions, and with the possibility of having Internet access without filters, obstructions or prohibitive costs.Senior Americas Program Coordinator at the Committee to Protect JournalistsJobs are coming back, but pay isn\u0027t. The median wage is still below where it was before the Great Recession. Last month, average pay actually fell. What\u0027s going on?

In this interview, Alan Taylor discusses his findings and suggests ways to safeguard the financial system.Author and cultural theoristThe same mindset that marks trans people as unfit to share and depict their own stories comes from the same place as the invalidation that causes us to experience discrimination and self-loathing on so many other levels. Seeing your true self in media is important and can save lives.Writer, journalist and a black queer trans feministMany historians just see King as a \"civil rights\" leader, but they don\u0027t fully understand how being a minister and a faith leader made his role in the movement possible. Oyelowo believes, after the years of research into King and the civil rights movement, that King could not have led this movement had he not been a \"man of faith.\"Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersLogically, the right to life takes precedent because all other rights are contingent on the right to life being respected -- while respecting other rights does not secure the right to life. Moreover, our criminal code, and that of most other nations, including Muslim ones, punishes murder much more severely than other crimes, revealing the special reverence we hold to life.Professor of international relations, George Washington UniversityThere is a stigma that is rampant in our society towards mental illness. Yet it is worse for communities of color. I want my community to know that this is not something to be ashamed about.
