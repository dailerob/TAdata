{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghThe bane of most policy debates is failure to define precisely and clearly what the problem is. The current debate on drone assassinations of U.S. citizens abroad and related issues vividly demonstrates that truth. The unspoken premise is that the country is menaced by powerful forces that could strike the United States of American targets at any time. We remain in thrall to the horrific images of 9/11. So awful is the prospect of a repeat, so raw are the emotions, so lingering is the dread that it distorts our thinking and warps assessments of what actual threats are out there. As a consequence, we have trapped ourselves in a nightmare where we are hostage to our own irrational impulses.Read Post | Comments (84)Bob Cesca, 02/14/13Political Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowKneejerk conflation of Obama and Bush could be the most ridiculous talking point to come out of the mouths of liberals in the post-Bush era. Without the benefit of logic or historical context, it\u0027s merely a cheap crowd-pleaser used by anyone seeking the accolades of similarly nearsighted sycophants.Read Post | Comments (473)Janine R. Wedel, 02/14/13Author, \"Shadow Elite\"Islands like the Caymans are well-known as corporate tax havens, and earlier this week Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders railed against rampant offshore tax abuse. What\u0027s less well-known, but perhaps just as troubling, is that hedge funds use these havens to avoid something else as well: proper governance.Read Post | Comments (105)Rita Wilson, 02/14/13Editor at Large, Huff/Post50; Actor, Producer, SingerI have a scrapbook full of memories, and decaying gardenias that will be passed onto my kids and grandkids.

If our kids don\u0027t make cards, or write poems, what will they show their kids when they\u0027re Post Fifty?Read Post | Comments (77)Sarah Klein, 02/14/13Associate Editor, Healthy LivingYou might wonder why I\u0027ve decided to write, rather than just curse you in silence. Writing to you certainly won\u0027t make my Valentine better. But there\u0027s a small chance it might resonate with someone noticing a change in his own body and convince him to bring his concerns to his doctor.Read Post | Comments (45)Christine Pelosi, 02/14/13Author, Campaign Boot Camp 2.0To my Isabella, as with most three-year-olds, Valentine\u0027s Day is innocence and chocolate.

El-Erian, 02/14/13CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOIt is not surprising that the G-7 statement did very little to dampen currency movements. I also doubt that the other likely short-term objective -- that of pre-empting currency disagreements at Friday\u0027s G-20 meeting -- will be fully successful.Read Post | CommentsRuth Bettelheim, Ph.D., 02/13/13Psychotherapist; Executive/life coachThe path to true romantic success isn\u0027t out toward some other ideal person -- it instead demands that we turn inward, and develop our own capacities to choose appropriate partners, form intimate bonds, and maintain mutually satisfying relationships. No one is born with those skills.Read Post | Comments (47)Jenn Horton, 02/13/13Writer, Editor, MomYour Cupid\u0027s arrow has bulls-eyed me, my sweet Sammy.

Older love has more of a sweatshirt feel to it -- warm, soft and so very familiar. In the 32 years I have known my husband, our love has morphed into something so comfortable that I can\u0027t imagine my life without him. I had never imagined his life without me.Read Post | Comments (16)Jared Bernstein, 02/14/13Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThose who want to tout their preference for the EITC to lift the pay of low earners must explicitly call for an increase.
