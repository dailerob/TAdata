{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jeremy RifkinAuthor, \u0027The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of Things, the Collaborative Commons, and the Eclipse of Capitalism\u0027The capitalist era is passing... not quickly, but inevitably. A new economic paradigm -- the Collaborative Commons -- is rising in its wake that will transform our way of life. We are already witnessing the emergence of a hybrid economy, part capitalist market and part Collaborative Commons. The two economic systems often work in tandem and sometimes compete. They are finding synergies along each other\u0027s perimeters, where they can add value to one another, while benefiting themselves. At other times, they are deeply adversarial, each attempting to absorb or replace the other.Wall Street banks have the right to express their views to lawmakers and regulators through lobbying, but the law is clear: If they want to influence lawmakers, they must disclose their lobbying expenditures.Sen. Elizabeth WarrenDemocratic Senator from MassachusettsThe executives at GM knew for 13 years that their cars had a defective ignition switch that would, well, kill people. But they did a \"cost-benefit analysis\" and concluded that paying off the deceased\u0027s relatives was going to be cheaper than having to install a $10 part per car.Michael MooreOscar and Emmy-winning DirectorI admit it. It\u0027s true. I lie to the people running the food pantry. But before you get out your pitchforks and righteous indignation, before you diatribe about me \"abusing the system\" or taking advantage, please let me explain.Trisha LovetroveFreelance writer and bloggerSkilled Wall Street-botherer Michael Lewis has a new book out claiming the stock market is hopelessly rigged against investors, and the backlash from Wall Street has been predictably ferocious. The backlash is not entirely wrong! It is just wrong about some of the most important stuff.Mark GongloffChief financial writer, The Huffington PostWe\u0027ll remember that bringing up children is something that generations of adults have done before us without too much fuss or bother and we\u0027ll rediscover that kids, when left alone, have amazing abilities to learn and grow.Hilary WilceEducation correspondent, writer, personal development coachAfter being tipped off by a subscriber to my Honest Slogans site, it appears that someone has created a counterblog entitled Dishonest Slogans that takes slogans I\u0027ve created and makes them, well, dishonest as opposed to truthful.Clif DickensGraphic DesignerThe makers of the film assure us that they have tried to stay true to the values of a story that is a \"cornerstone of faith for millions of people worldwide.\" I think the filmmakers have stayed true to those values. The problem is these values are morally repugnant.Ronald A. LindsayPresident \u0026 CEO, Center for InquiryWhat it comes down to is that How I Met Your Mother tricked us. Its sitcom trappings promised a lighthearted romantic romp with a happy ending, not nine years of lead-up to a tragic gut punch.Claire FallonBooks Editor, The Huffington PostThis week begins the make-or-break, do-or-die standardized testing that will label your child a success or a failure. I urge you not to let your child take the state test. Opt out.Diane RavitchResearch Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027The continued conflict has forced millions of people from their homes with more than half of them being children. This disruption has adversely affected their daily lives, limiting access to food, water, health care and education.AkonPhilanthropist, Business Mogul, Five-Time Grammy Nominated ArtistLet\u0027s consider the life lessons to be taken away from the bloodshed, nudity, and moral ambiguity. Here are five things Game of Thrones has taught us about real life.Jenna AmatulliCrime/Weird News Fellow, The Huffington PostPut yourself in Mary Barra\u0027s shoes: You have been CEO of GM for just two weeks. Then you learn that the company has a major safety problem with ignition switches that has caused 12 deaths, and you must recall 1.6 million vehicles. Your investigation uncovers that employees have known about this for 12 years but the problem was never surfaced.Bill GeorgeProfessor of Management Practice, Harvard Business SchoolNations that take far fewer drugs than we do are healthier. Why?Dr. Andrew WeilFounder and director, The Arizona Center for Integrative MedicineWhen you play Division I sports, you\u0027re not treated as a \"student-athlete\" -- as colleges love to profess to the world -- you\u0027re an athlete-student, and you\u0027re there for one reason and one reason only. You can keep your grades up enough to remain eligible, but then again, that\u0027s only so you can be able to play -- and earn more money for the university.Etan ThomasAuthor, poet, philanthropist, 11-year NBA veteranIt\u0027d be swell if we could all have law degrees without studying and find love without awkward dates and pet kangaroos without biking down highways over glass shards. But achieving a goal requires choosing a path, which may mean you\u0027re (at least temporarily) turning your back on another.Joanna ZelmanFront page editor, The Huffington PostThe larger media coverage question is, has the press been wed for so long to the Republican-friendly narrative of a broken and doomed Obamacare system that journalists are refusing to adjust the storyline as crucial new facts emerge?Eric BoehlertSenior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaOkCupid\u0027s decision to take a stand for gay rights is not only morally appropriate, but also good business.Jess CarbinoSociologist, dating and relationship expertJeff DanzigerPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideThere was that sharp, metallic taste of blood in my mouth (apparently, this can happen after an extremely intense work out). I was huffing and puffing like a birthing water buffalo. But I was alive. And I felt amazing.Kimberly MeskimenMarketing and sales professionalOvercoming individual addiction to narcotic substances is never an easy task; resisting our addiction to carbon will prove no easier. However, the sooner we recast the climate issue as a public health problem, akin to drug addiction, the sooner we will be able to fashion effective strategies for averting its worst effects.Michael T. KlareAuthor and Professor of Peace and World-Security Studies, Hampshire CollegeIt\u0027s true that history and policy point to overall benefits from expanded trade because all of us gain access to cheaper goods and services. But in recent years the biggest gains from trade have gone to investors and executives while the burdens have fallen disproportionately on those in the middle and below who have lost good-paying jobs.Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The right-wing thinkers at Heritage may object that they have the right to pay their president whatever they feel like. Of course they are right, but the issue here is whether they have the right to force taxpayers to subsidize the bloated salary they pay to their president.Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Today Defense Secretary Hagel is hosting the Defense Minister of Burma among others to discuss the Obama administration’s commitment to “peace and security” in the region. But there is no peace and security for the ethnic minorities in Burma.Tom AndrewsPresident, United to End GenocideAssuming the report is correct, the Palestinians would be out of their minds to accept it. It is bad for Israelis and Palestinians and demeans the United States by reducing us to the role of Benjamin Netanyahu\u0027s stenographer.MJ RosenbergBloggerBecause of rampant Wall Street in what\u0027s called the RIN (which stands for Renewable Identification Numbers) market, taxpayers are once again helping Wall Street traders get rich. And to compound the problem, the biggest oil companies are colluding with the Wall Street guys to make extra money at our expense as well.Mike LuxCo-Founder, Democracy PartnersRev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkPro-gun and anti-gun groups can always manufacture a good argument -- but they might try, just once, to ground their opinions in real facts.Mike WeisserMike the Gun GuyThis isn\u0027t about not holding myself accountable for my actions; it\u0027s about no longer reflexively blurting out an apology I don\u0027t really owe. It\u0027s about changing my default setting from unnecessary guilt.Ani VrabelDeputy blog editor, The Huffington PostThe great political struggle we now face is whether the United States retains its democratic heritage or whether we move toward an oligarchic form of society where the real political power rests with a handful of billionaires, not ordinary Americans.Sen. Bernie SandersIndependent U.S. Senator from VermontThe new report released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change -- the world\u0027s preeminent group of climate scientists -- represents even more definitive evidence of the growing urgency to immediately reduce the spewing of global warming pollution.Al GoreChairman, Generation Investment Management and The Climate Reality ProjectGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"BARACK ENROLL!",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
