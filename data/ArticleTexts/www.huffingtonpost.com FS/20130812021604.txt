{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week brought the further merging of new and traditional media when Amazon\u0027s Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post for $250 million. The prevailing sentiment from media observers was one of hope -- hope that someone as innovative and entrepreneurial as Bezos can save this valuable part of America\u0027s cultural infrastructure. With all the talk this week about preserving great journalism, it\u0027s also a valuable opportunity to ponder what\u0027s missing from our media landscape. If the purpose of journalism is to give people a better sense of what\u0027s happening in their world, reporting only on what\u0027s broken isn\u0027t enough. How about more on what is working? At a time when our government is deeply dysfunctional, showing how people are having a positive impact in their communities -- and how others can too -- is essential. Let\u0027s just hope Bezos succeeds in reviving his new purchase before his 10,000-year clock runs out.Comments (48)Sen. Bernie Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth WarrenThe next Fed chair will have an opportunity to get our economy back on track and to help rebuild America\u0027s middle class. But that will require the right temperament and a willingness to take on Wall Street CEOs when necessary.Comments (362)Stephen FryBritish Actor, Writer, Lord of Dance, Prince of Swimwear \u0026 BloggerAn absolute ban on the Russian Winter Olympics of 2014 in Sochi is simply essential. Stage them elsewhere in Utah, Lillehammer, anywhere you like. At all costs Putin cannot be seen to have the approval of the civilised world.Comments (1,597)Walter IsaacsonPresident and CEO, Aspen InstituteI\u0027ve noticed a few things about Jeff over the years. He thinks things through carefully. He\u0027s not impulsive. He\u0027s not driven by ego. He develops a strong theory of the case for every new endeavor.Comments (50)Arianna HuffingtonI\u0027m solidly behind any effort to show that we\u0027re more than just our marginal contribution to our bank account, the bottom line of our employer or the gross national product of our country. But it\u0027s important to look at the whole picture.Comments (127)José Ramos-HortaFormer President, East Timor, 1996 Nobel Peace Prize laureateIf the position of Nobel Peace Prize laureate adds authority and force to one\u0027s words, it is better used to encourage calm, dialogue and peaceful resolution than to further polarize.Comments (70)Keith BarryMagicianThe power of hypnosis is a constant source of debate. My own research and the fact that I have now hypnotized over 3,000 people give me a unique and personal view of how the brain functions subconsciously.Comments (284)Rachel Macy StaffordSpecial Education TeacherAlthough the words \"hurry up\" did little if nothing to increase my child\u0027s speed, I said them anyway. Maybe even more than the words, \"I love you.\" The truth hurts, but the truth heals... and brings me closer to the parent I want to be.Comments (606)Marty KaplanDirector, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolThanks to generations of hagiographic Republican politicians, and the press\u0027s lazy confusion of partisan mythmaking with historical facts, the retroactive meaning of Reaganism has come to include the triumph of religious faith over secular humanism, family values over hippie hedonism, the market over the state.Comments (1,120)ShakiraSinger, Activist and Founder of the Barefoot FoundationMy career as a singer has given me my greatest gift of all--my voice. It\u0027s a gift that allows me to express myself as an artist but also one that affords me a platform to shine the spotlight on issues infinitely more important than my own career.Comments (43)Smokey BearOnly you can prevent wildfiresI turn 69 years old today! Sixty-nine years of wildfire prevention messaging and awareness, waving at parades, standing guard at campsites, showing people how to douse a campfire and even giving out #SmokeyBearHugs.Comments (28)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistHere\u0027s a little test: If you opened the newspaper tomorrow morning and read a story that revealed that Anthony Weiner was, yet again, up to his old junk-sharing adventures, would you:a) be shocked like you were the first time? b) be shocked and furious like you were the second time? c) be shocked and furious -- and then start scanning the Web for more details?Comments (283)Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Mary Anne HittThe Clean Water Act is one of our nation\u0027s greatest statutory achievements. But 40 years after the Act was passed, the coal industry is still polluting with impunity, thanks to a loophole that no other industry enjoys.Comments (105)Greta Van SusterenHost, Fox News\u0027 \u0027On the Record With Greta Van Susteren\u0027The newspaper industry might have dodged the 8 ball if they had skipped the salons where they talk to each other and instead realized that they are a service industry (yes, like a lawn service or even cable news) and thus evolved to meet the needs of their customers.Comments (94)Morris W. O\u0027KellyHost of \"The Mo\u0027Kelly Show\" on KFI am640 and XM Satellite RadioWe\u0027re not in search of black faces repeating exactly what was said previously by the white ones. Trust me, we aren\u0027t. We\u0027re in search of meaningful inclusion and substantive competition for our votes on a policy level.Comments (1,105)Lynn ParramoreAlterNet Editor; Co-founder, Recessionwire; Founding Editor of New Deal 2.0Before dismissing a man who made a mistake five years ago, women should look at the total record and the whole person before deciding if Eliot Spitzer is a candidate worth supporting.Comments (390)Bill RichardsonFormer U.S. Energy Secretary, Governor of New Mexico and UN AmbassadorPreventing the full breadth of U.S. climate change risks -- from sea-level rise and extreme weather and climate events -- will require action at all levels. Everyone from local counties in Florida to the federal government has a critical role to play.Comments (502)Katie HopkinsBroadcaster and business womanMen don\u0027t tend to do sulking. If there is an issue, they address the issue. Everyone feels better and cracks on with their day job. Later they will go for a drink and talk about cricket. Equally, if you are going to play the PMT card and stomp about ... you really need to be sure you haven\u0027t been a bit of an arse on Twitter yourself. Duplicity does not work.Comments (174)Max Jacobson-FriedWriter, CrossFitterI\u0027m not sure when it happened, but at some point in my mid to late 20s, I reached a state of general malaise. I knew CrossFit had something to do with doing 100 pull ups and throwing up, which was a fancy stretch from my normal routine. I signed up for an Intro course and jumped right in.Comments (949)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarIn my work as a research psychologist currently studying women in the workplace, I hear women describe this sort of near-obsessive commitment to work with increasing frequency. For many, it\u0027s how they develop feelings of self worth. This can be both empowering and dangerous.Comments (40)Jimmy McMillanFounder, The Rent Is Too Damn High PartyI said it once and I\u0027ll say it again: We\u0027re all freaky and Anthony Weiner just exposed his freaky-ism in the wrong way.Comments (299)Sarah Elizabeth RichardsJournalist; Author, Motherhood RescheduledMore and more women are seeking refuge in the freezer. It\u0027s nice in the world of \"Maybe someday. Just not now.\" But we all know that the respite from the biological clock is temporary.Comments (39)Jonathan WeilerDirector of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel HillNow that Commissioner Selig has thrown the book at Alex Rodriguez, it is past time for sports media to stop giving a free pass to the man who is most responsible for having allowed the steroid problem to fester for as long as it did -- the commissioner himself.Comments (169)Katja BroseEditor, \u0027Neuron\u0027; Executive Editor for \u0027Neuroscience\u0027, Cell PressThe more interesting question is, if neuroscience can explain magic, can magic teach us anything about neuroscience?CommentsRyan BuxtonEditorial fellow, HuffPost LiveI always assumed the years of hiding my truth from my dad didn\u0027t matter, that once I came out to him we\u0027d have all the time in the world to reconcile our opposing viewpoints. Instead, closure was another thing we didn\u0027t get to share.Comments (64)Daphne EviatarSenior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstPresident Obama, at his pre-vacation press conference Friday, promised more \"transparency\" on U.S. government surveillance programs. But he made no mention of the need for more information about who our government is secretly killing abroad.Comments (161)Seth ShulmanSenior Staff Writer, Union of Concerned ScientistsWhile Koch-funded groups like AFP are unlikely to heed the message anytime soon, there is every indication in the solar energy field that the political terrain is starting to shift dramatically.Comments (1,033)Anne TheriaultFeminist bloggerYou are a bad person who deserves bad things. You are unhappy because you are lazy or lacking in willpower. Your family and friends do not love you. Everyone deserves better than you. Everything is your fault. There is no cure for your sadness.Comments (601)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesThe ugly truth about Russia\u0027s law against gay \"propaganda,\" now the subject of worldwide protests and boycotts, is coming into view. And that includes the role of American companies sponsoring the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, as well that of the International Olympic Committee.Comments (554)Beth WoolseyWriter, humorist at the Five Kids Is A Lot of Kids blogWe all know the old adage \"never pee into the wind,\" but there are some additional, quality, \"how to\" ideas about peeing that are not, apparently, self-evident. For those times, here are 15 rules for peeing.Comments (155)Leo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersThe party is so focused on wrangling that it has turned itself into a spandex-wearing professional wrestling cartoon character. Fighting is not what Americans want. They want peace and prosperity. Republicans need to get that message and get to work.Comments (191)Jared Bernstein, 2013.11.08Jane Vandenburgh, 2013.11.08Joe Conason, 2013.11.08Ernest Owens, 2013.11.08Justine Valinotti, 2013.11.08Her Campus, 2013.11.08John K.
