{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Author \u0026 JournalistToday\u0027s headlines about the downing of the Malaysian airliner with nearly 300 people on board over the Donetsk region feels like, in the immortal words of Yogi Berra, déjà vu all over again. Once again, a Mideast crisis has been eclipsed by the downing of a passenger jet with all signs pointing to the pro-Russian separatists or Russian forces on the Russian-Ukrainian border as the culprits -- although of course the Russians are blaming the Ukrainians. And, more importantly, once again a Russian leader -- this time, Vladimir Putin -- is likely to discover that this latest act of callous brutality will in the long run undermine his power at home and whatever remains of his standing abroad.Humans have been looking for the giant squid ever since we first started taking pictures underwater. But the elusive deep-sea predator could never be caught on film -- until now.\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"I suspect that when the histories are written, this will be deemed the day the insurgency lost.Professor of Global Affairs at NYU’s Center for Global Affairs; Founding Editor of the journal \u0027Global Crime\u0027Palestinians want to live normal lives. They want to be able to provide for their children and see their children\u0027s children grow and prosper. It is not, as the Israelis would say, that the Palestinians have chosen death. Rather, it is that the Israelis have never allowed them the chance to choose life.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027As a nutritionist, I counsel many clients who know what foods to eat to lose weight and be healthy. However, even the most educated of consumers may have trouble determining how much to eat of these foods.Nationally-recognized nutritionist; International Speaker; Adjunct professor of nutrition at NYU; Author, \u0027The Portion Teller Plan\u0027Mr. Putin has had many opportunities to condemn the violence, but he has failed every time. Putin\u0027s silence, which effectively condones the terrorists\u0027 activities in eastern Ukraine, bares a grave cost.Member of the Ukrainian Parliament (Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine)Many helicopter bosses feel the need to hover in order to monitor efficiency, or to keep things on track, especially if an employee has erred in the past. But most micromanagers do so out of a need for control that often has more to do with them than the performance of their employees.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarDespite the lack of any reasonable hope of release, I am demonstrating my commitment to becoming a better productive member of society in whatever way I can.Inmate, Federal Correctional Institution, Greenville, IllinoisIf present trends continue, the U.S. will have a dual system of education in another decade. What is at stake is the great tradition of public schools, open to all, supported by all, controlled by the public, not corporations.Research Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027I didn\u0027t know how difficult this would be on me. I\u0027ve done it before and embraced it with a smile and strength. This time was nothing like before. This time, I was told that this disease would rip me from the arms of my children and husband.Mother, Wife, Stage IV SurvivingIt\u0027s too late to reverse the death and destruction, but it\u0027s never too early to advocate for peace and life.Executive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostThere will be no peace, for now, as Gaza is turned into an abattoir, to collectively punish Gazans for supporting Hamas. Israel, as any nation, has a right to defend itself, but it confuses offense with defense. It is on the offensive in Gaza.Fmr. 16-year Member of US Congress; Two-time US Presidential CandidateThe repetition of Washington\u0027s call to arms manifests as a form of black comedy: it is funny until you realize its horror.Senior Fellow, Center for International Policy; Board of Directors, Council for a Livable World; MatthewHoh.comAs Congress and the Administration consider proposals to eviscerate the heretofore obscure (now demonized) Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA), it makes sense to review the case for change and to query whether the proposed cure might not do more harm than good.Executive Director, Center for Migration StudiesThere\u0027s a lot of booze out there named for a lot of people, but what do we really know about them? Did John Jameson really show up at his own funeral? Is Sailor Jerry actually a sailor? Here\u0027s a glimpse at the actual men behind your favorite firewaterTheDailyMeal.comThis is not the first time a civilian jetliner has been shot down -- accidentally or otherwise. There have been several such incidents over the years.Airline pilot, air travel columnist and authorThe spreading popularity of Net Neutrality really rankles those in Washington who have been trying so hard to portray it as a \"government takeover of the Internet.\"Senior Director of Strategy, Free PressWhy is pay equality good in some settings but bad in others?Wharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027On July 20, the NAACP will recognize the Day of Unity, to combat the disparate impact that HIV has on Black America. As an ordained minister, I know the power that faith communities can wield by providing life saving education and advocacy. This is not the time to be quiet. This is the time to speak.Chairman, NAACP National Board of DirectorsThese triathletes leaving me in their dust knew where I was coming from; they had all had a first race, too. By the time I got to the running portion -- finally, something I\u0027m good at, I thought to myself -- I had to pay that encouragement forward and did my best to cheer along the runners who needed a lift.Senior Editor, Health \u0026 Fitness; Certified Personal TrainerI met my wife, Joy Carroll, at Greenbelt, a summer festival of faith, arts, and justice in England. I have a vivid memory of returning to Greenbelt in 2002 with our son Luke. Joy was on the worship platform celebrating the Eucharist for 20,000 people. Luke looked up at me and said, \"Daddy, can men do that too?\"Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersSweet and juicy summer berries are here! Put them to use in salads, parfaits, muffins and more...Once Upon a ChefThe notion that Israel and Hamas \"trade\" attacks, or the consistent need for journalists to mention deaths in Gaza alongside \"rockets raining down\" on Israel, mask the reality of the situation on the ground.Features Editor, Islamic HorizonsRejection is the deepest of all artistic suffering because it is not just what we do -- it is who we are. And when we are celebrated for our work, there is nothing that comes closer to validating our soul.Author, \u0027Fugitive Colors\u0027 (Arcade) - a suspenseful tale of stolen art, love, lust, and revenge on the \"eve\" of WWII.We need civically engaged Muslims to tackle these issues from all fronts.

The meetings can be used to build consensus toward positions that can be brought back to forums where decisions can be enforced, such as the WTO. And this is exactly what the US plans to do.Director, International Programs at the Center for Economic and Policy ResearchAs the first turbaned Sikh American to play basketball for an NCAA program, I knew I needed to voice my opinion when I learned Sikh players on India\u0027s team were told by FIBA they must remove their dastars before playing at the Japan-India game.Pioneer in Sikh-American athletics; portfolio manager for Satori AlphaFor those of us like myself who care about the well-being of all people on the planet, not only my own Jewish people, but all peoples. The high toll of Palestinian civilians is horrifying -- several thousand civilians already wounded according to Palestinian sources.Editor, Tikkun MagazineUntil someone on one side or the other finds the humility and wisdom to not shoot back, the human right to pursue happiness and raise our children in health and safety will never be a reality for some in some parts of the world. And that is unacceptable.Sass \u0026 SensibilityNow here\u0027s where I make an admission that will get me in trouble: I disagreed with the City\u0027s decision to file an objection to the proposed group home, and I recommended against submitting it.Mayor of New Rochelle, NYUnlike most countries around the globe, sport policy development and implementation in the United States is almost solely the responsibility of the country\u0027s sports power brokers. And these power brokers have a personal vested interest -- too often ego-based and/or greed-based in nature.Sports Policy Director, League of FansGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"UKRAINE: REBELS DESTROYING EVIDENCE \u0027WITH RUSSIA\u0027S HELP\u0027 \u0027Cover-Up\u0027...
