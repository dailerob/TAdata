{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressWashington bureau chief for The Huffington PostWatching the coverage of these tragic deaths, a viewer would be left with the impression of a drone program that has had a stellar record of accuracy up until it unfortunately killed two innocent people. But, in fact, killing innocent people has been a central part of the drone program from the very beginning, and is in many ways an inescapable consequence. It\u0027s not that a perfect program finally slipped up. Rather, a program that has killed somewhere between 400 and 1000 civilians in Pakistan alone finally killed an American civilian, to whom no wrongdoing can be even tangentially attributed.We must continue to fight for the rights of workers everywhere by ensuring that no one should be coerced or forced into unsafe work -- especially not children -- because that is all that is available to them.Co-Founder, A World at School; Executive Chair, Global Business Coalition for EducationThe contrast between the haves and have-nots might be especially stark at that New York building, but millions of families across the country are finding themselves on the wrong side of the poor door.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundDrone strikes have killed other Americans, as well as civilians, in a controversial policy used by the Obama administration in recent years. But the president defended January\u0027s operations during his press briefing today.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityPresident Obama is willing to commit military resources to back up the Saudi war on Yemeni rebels. But when it comes to their war on women, like every U.S. president before him, the Supreme Commander is missing in action.Money Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsIt is just two weeks into the 2016 Presidential campaign and Democrats have ceded their nomination to Hillary Clinton. They better hope that she and Bill have good answers to the questions that are going to be coming their way. We could be in for a long year.President, Fiscal Strategies GroupWe live in the Age of Vine and Sabermetrics. But when Rose plays like he did last night, even for a game, it’s a much-needed reminder that at their best, sports are more than collections of clips waiting to be uploaded, looped and shared with the world.Senior Sports EditorThe longer you wait to start a new life, the more settled you\u0027ll feel where you are and the older you\u0027ll be. You\u0027re only in your early 20s once and the time goes by quickly. If you want to try something new, now is the time.Founder, ForeverTwentySomethings.comLest you think the TPP is too commercially complex to bother about, think again. This mega-treaty is the latest corporate coup-d\u0027état that sacrifices the American consumer, labor and environmental standards and much U.S. sovereignty to the supremacy of corporate commercial trade.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorDharnai, a solar-powered village in India, shows how we can make the renewables boom deliver for all -- including the rural poor. Dharnai is located in Bihar, one of the poorest provinces in India. It did not have access to electricity for 30 years before a solar mini-grid was installed with the support of Greenpeace India in July last year.Executive Director, Greenpeace InternationalThe Herald\u0027s disclosures about the way for-profit colleges have ripped off students and taxpayers, while buying influence with powerful politicians, are too many to recount, but here are just a few bites to tempt you.Attorney, advocate, writer at RepublicReport.orgThe discussion about whether Bruce Jenner is transitioning has me feeling simultaneously hopeful and deeply uncomfortable. Uncomfortable because, as a daughter of a \"transparent,\" the tabloid tone of ridicule with which the speculation has been presented recalls the cruel words I heard behind my back growing up.Assistant Editor, Penguin Random HouseClimate deniers in Congress must be delighted that they are successfully undermining the chance that after 20 years of negotiations, the international community will finally reach a climate deal this year. It is up to the rest of us to make sure their success is short-lived. Very short-lived, in fact.Executive Director, Presidential Climate Action ProjectFor the past 70 years, the World Bank has strived to foster worldwide economic development, all while taking care not to cause undue harm in its wake. It has had some great successes and some humbling defeats. Now, in 2015, it\u0027s time the Bank makes good on its promise to ensure women are not harmed by but rather can contribute to and benefit equally from Bank investments.Executive Director, Oxfam InternationalHave you considered what price you\u0027ll pay physically, mentally, even financially, if you don\u0027t take action to improve your work life? Real results require real actions -- yours.Humanitarian, writer, speaker, literary agent, female entrepreneurAs Christians, we are called to love our neighbors. The Bible tells us to welcome strangers in our land and to love them as we love ourselves. That\u0027s why the media and all Americans should immediately stop referring to our undocumented brothers and sisters as \"illegal.\"Executive Director of Define American. Organizer, consultant, and ordained minister/chaplain. Dedicated to justice and a ministry of hope.I shouldn\u0027t be giving advice to the President since he is on the other side of this Fast Track/TPP fight, but I will anyway: Mr. President, you are badly hurting yourself by escalating this fight with the progressive community over trade.Co-Founder, Democracy PartnersAs daunting as it seems, finding a cheap flight is not impossible and shouldn\u0027t require that much time and effort. Cheap flights are possible, you just need to know where to look.Experience Orchestrator, Traveler, Producer, EntrepreneurGetting richer but not happier: It\u0027s a familiar story, for people and for nations. The purpose of the World Happiness Report, now in its third edition for 2015, is to remind governments, civil society, and individuals that income alone cannot secure our well-being.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia UniversityThe current trade regime is not just a matter of the U.S. exporting manufacturing jobs to China and importing cheaper consumer goods. We are also dramatically increasing the volume of pollution associated with our consumption, so much that a significant part of U.S. pollution is now generated in China in the production of goods for U.S. consumers.Former executive director and chairman, Sierra ClubLots of things became clear to us sports fans last year. Some were positive and encouraging, others were bittersweet, if not depressing. Here is #1: Jim Harbaugh is no wizard. Good, opportunistic, smart, tough football coach, but no wizard.Playwright and author (\"It\u0027s Never Been Easy: Essays on Modern Labor\")Over the past nine months, the FBI has arrested five African Americans suspected of sympathizing with ISIS. These arrests necessitate an examination of why some African Americans might be drawn to violent extremist groups.National Diversity Expert; Principal and Chief Strategist of Criticality Management Consulting; Former Associate Dean of Harvard CollegeI asked God for a year. OK, truthfully, I begged for 10. Because I wanted to be your father for as long as possible, until each of you became adults. It was a begging rooted in my personal desire to see each of you grow up. Mature. And step into life. That\u0027s why today is rather special.Bobblehead Dad; Author; Speaker; Parenting Columnist; Radio Host; Cancer WarriorDr. Oz is not a dumb guy. He has an undergrad degree from Harvard and both an MBA and a medical degree from the University of Pennsylvania. He is a professor in Columbia University\u0027s surgery department. But fame and money have turned the accomplished Turkish-American cardiothoracic surgeon into a cross between a game-show host and an infomercial spokesperson.Senior Media Editor, The Huffington PostThe year leading to diagnosis was the darkest and brightest year for me. As a mother, I was vulnerable and that humbled me. My radar kicked in. This was no longer about me. This was about him.Mother, entrepreneur and public speaker. Finding strength in the vulnerable spaces of parenting, and raising a child with autism.Even those rare guys who are completely at peace with their place in the family and world routinely bump up against assumptions that they secretly resent their wives, tolerate their children and down deep, kind of hate their lives.Author, \"Plus One,\" \u0027Rejuvenile\u0027From one end of the globe to the other, \"have-nots\" are looking with envy at the lives of the \"haves.\" This is not about ideology or politics. They are not revolutionaries looking to overturn the old order or seeking payback for the legacy of colonial imperialism, rather they are looking to join it and benefit from its bounty.Best Selling Military History and World Affairs Author and Keynote SpeakerThe important point to remember is that the United States cares far more about the health of the European Union and the global financial system than it does about Greece. If the Tsipras government continues to seem aggressively ambivalent about its desire for rescue within that system, the U.S. government will watch from the sidelines as it sinks.Former diplomat in in the U.S. Foreign ServiceChanging family dynamics, a shifting economic landscape, the surge of women into the workforce and public life are all adding pieces to the kaleidoscopic picture of what it means to be a man in America today. Begging the question: Just who is the 21st Century Man?Award-winning journalist, bestselling author and activistAuthor, All In: How Our Work-First Culture Fails Dads, Families, and Businesses -- And How We Can Fix It Together (see joshlevs.com)Tonight, I\u0027m joined by Jack Black, one of this generation\u0027s most beloved comedic actors.
