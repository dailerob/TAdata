{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Tuesday\u0027s Democratic debate is a very big deal, especially for front-runner Hillary Clinton. Bernie Sanders will probably exceed expectations because many viewers will be seeing him for the first time, certainly for the first time against Clinton. The other three candidates will likely find themselves far back -- this is narrowing to a two person contest. Clinton needs to get out of a self-infecting cycle of bad publicity, in which everything she does is dismissed as calculating and contrived, even when it represents creative movement on issues. Sanders merely needs to take care to come across as fighting for the forgotten American on the issues, as he nearly always does, but not too radical in his personal style.Obama, with his lawyer\u0027s training, is risk averse, so he naturally prefers the line of least resistance. As the anti-Bush, his approach to strategy boils down to \"Don\u0027t do stupid s***.\" But that, like \"strategic patience,\" is just another way of saying, \"Always kick the can down the road.\"Laurence A. Tisch Professor of History at Harvard University; Senior Fellow of the Hoover Institution, Stanford UniversityAs a society, we may feel safer by believing the threat of violence can be ascribed to one group of people. Like human nature, however, the truth is more complicated.NFL wide receiver; Co-founder, PROJECT 375What choices do progressives have? Hillary Clinton leaves a lot to be desired. She does favor a woman\u0027s right to choose and has recently come out in support of marriage equality. But, Clinton has been called a \"focus group Democrat,\" often accused of believing what polls and focus groups tell her she should believe.Professor, Thomas Jefferson School of LawWhy do we honor a man who, if he were alive today, would almost certainly be sitting on Death Row awaiting execution?Founder and CEO of the Imagine Institute, a think tankHopefully Tuesday night\u0027s Democratic presidential debate will cast a spotlight on the differences among the candidates and delve into substantive issues that have not been adequately addressed in the campaign to date.Director, Arms and Security Project, Center for International PolicyWhile there are American-style liberals in China, some intellectuals and others view freedom through a different, and they say Chinese, prism. Some reject U.S.-style democracy without exactly affirming CCP-led autocracy. Everyone wants to be heard, but they don\u0027t necessarily want everyone else, especially the rural masses, to be heard.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteThe research on guns and gun ownership is clear. Having firearms in your home makes everyone who lives there more likely to be a victim of gun violence, period. That\u0027s irresponsible parenting.Writer, educator, mental health advocate and mother of fourThere\u0027s no reason for the US to swallow a trade deal filled with rotten rodent terms. American workers know for sure that if the scheme contains any foie gras, it\u0027ll be served on silver platters to corporations while workers are force-fed rats. America should withdraw. Congress should reject the TPP.International President, United SteelworkersThe Wisconsin legislature is going the extra mile with three separate bills to retroactively decriminalize the behavior at the heart of the investigation and to defang the nonpartisan elections agency that aided it. Two of the bills are on a fast track being sped through the legislature with an unusual Joint Senate/Assembly hearing on Tuesday.The Center for Media and Democracy/ALEC ExposedThe Tea Party wing of the House Republican party is seeking changes in the rules and procedures. Changes designed to strip the Speaker of the ability to assemble a majority within the House and enable that majority to govern. They cloak their demands in the language of bottom-up democracy. But their complaints about John Boehner\u0027s leadership give away the game. Former executive director and chairman, Sierra Club\"The question, Mr. Speaker, is not whether we like Saddam Hussein or not. The question is whether he represents an imminent threat to the American people and whether a unilateral invasion of Iraq will do more harm than good.\"Democratic candidate for President, US Senator from VermontCurrently, the largest national prescription for school shooting prevention happens to be active shooter training. Everyone wants to be prepared. And we should be. Just like we need to be prepared for all types of disasters, manmade or natural.School Safety Advocate, Educator, AuthorThe shocking truth people are finding out about Hillary Clinton is she has always been a real progressive. A progressive who understands how government works and that our founding fathers (to their shame there were no founding mothers) set up a government requiring compromise to move ideas forward.Political consultantThe more cutting debate about Kissinger and his works has to do with his conduct rather than his philosophy.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghOn a chilly night in 2013, as the stress of the semester was coming to a peak, I had the most scarring experience of my life. Being sexually assaulted -- raped -- shattered my self-image and confidence in my own voice. My self-worth was stolen from me by someone I previously trusted.Harvard senior studying neurobiology.Carson\u0027s fantasy scenario is the one that reflects the way many Americans approach the issue of guns. The fantasists have come to believe that if they had a gun, they\u0027d be able to ensure their own safety and the safety of those around them.Author of \u0027Obama’s America: A Transformative Vision of Our National Identity\u0027We took our baby girl home from the hospital soon after we took her off life support. We signed \"Do Not Resuscitate\" documents and we were assigned hospice care especially for children. It took 21 days. With each cavernous minute, I prayed for death to be swift.A writer working on a memoir, In the Womb of Love, about the death of her first-born daughter who lived only one month. www.AidaSalazar.comDespite the reality, a recent survey conducted by researchers (including myself) at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky has revealed that the vast majority of Americans believe \"the number of undocumented immigrants in the United States has been growing significantly over the past few years.\"Assistant Professor of Politics, Centre CollegeDid you see the YouTube video titled \"Drunk Kid Wants Mac and Cheese\"? It went viral last Tuesday. Did you laugh at the UConn student demanding his favorite jalapeno-flavored drunk food? Did you think the belligerent, slurring and entitled kid was funny? If you did, let me tell you why you\u0027re wrong.Second-year law student at Georgetown University. Graduated magna cum laude from UConn in 2014. Originally from Cheshire, CT.To describe this darkest hour in our nation\u0027s history as simply being based on a racist hatred of people of African descent is to miss the complexity of the transatlantic slave trade and the work of enslaved Africans in America.University Chaplain, University of PennsylvaniaPrivate prisons are a cancer. Private prisons make money by locking people up, and the more people they lock up for more time, the more money they make. Private prisons are morally distasteful, they don\u0027t save money, and they have historic performance problems. But they persist. Why does this cancer continue to grow?Author, Making MannaThe greatest strength of \"Steve Jobs,\" the farthest cry from a cradle to the grave biopic since \"I\u0027m Not There,\" is that it knows when to cut us loose and leave us to stew with questions in the wake of this flawed but omnipotent superpower.Memoirist, Film lover/writerSaying \u0027this is like the Nazis\u0027 or \u0027that is like the Holocaust\u0027 is one of the great rhetorical temptations around and, unfortunately, too many succumb to it\u0027s allure.Executive Editor Of Global Spirituality and Religion, The Huffington PostFor many, your deal may mean eating only canned tuna for weeks at a time, loading groceries onto maxed out credit cards, and defaulting on something and then faulting ourselves.Editor at TheModernTeam.comThe stars appear to be aligning for a major swing in American economic, social and political attitudes in the direction of progressive Democrats.HistorianRarely are there so many intelligent characters in a single film, and Aaron Sorkin nails their style of discourse and conflict persuasively, much as he did in The West Wing and The Social Network.CEO, Professional Investor and Chairman, Intelligence Squared U.S. DebatesPhotographer, Journalist, HuffPost Photo FellowThe United States now finds itself in a difficult position in Syria. American supported rebels are coming under direct attack by Russian military forces. If the U.S. challenges Russian planes it risks a potential escalation and a military incident between American and Russian forces.Best Selling Military History and World Affairs Author and Keynote SpeakerAfter two history-making Republican debates, what can we expect from the Democrats? Five contenders will take the stage on Tuesday in a match that is likely to feel very different from the Republican extravaganzas of August and September.Professor of Journalism, Northeastern University, BostonThusfar, the only scandals arising from the tragedy of the attacks at Benghazi, Libya... have been false reports, selective leaks designed to be misleading, and media manipulations -- all orchestrated by Republicans.Last person on Earth not on FacebookGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
