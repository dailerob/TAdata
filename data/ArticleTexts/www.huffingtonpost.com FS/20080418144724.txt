They, and their network, should hang their collective heads in shame.Read Post | CommentsBIOMarc Cooper, 04.16.2008During Tuesday night\u0027s Pennsylvania debate, George Stephanopoulos didn\u0027t flinch from trying to smear Barack Obama by association with former 60\u0027s radical Bill Ayres. Too bad George didn\u0027t ask Hillary about her summer spent working for a law firm run by Communists.Read Post | Comments (49)BIOMarty Kaplan, 04.16.2008The networks and the national press love their gotchas, their -gates, their \"controversies,\" their heat. Would someone please get the networks out of the presidential debate business?Read Post | Comments (28)BIOArianna Huffington, 04.16.2008Writing in The Hill, pollster Mark Mellman took me to the cyber-woodshed yesterday. Mellman claims that Lockheed hired him to produce \"a serious study on the underexplored subject of drug policy.\" Very noble of Lockheed.Read Post | Comments (60)BIOKareem Abdul-Jabbar, 04.16.2008I don\u0027t think the filmmakers for Dr. Seuss\u0027s Horton Hears a Who are evil or that they deliberately set out to send an awful message.
