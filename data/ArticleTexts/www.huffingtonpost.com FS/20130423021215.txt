{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027As a Bostonian, I have complex feelings about my civil liberties and my family\u0027s personal safety in the aftermath of the Marathon bombings. My wife was a block from the first explosion. My son and four-year-old grandson had considered going to the finish line but then changed their plans. The dead and maimed could have been any of us. But I fear for my country on two opposite grounds. The emerging history of Dzohkahr Tsarnaev suggests that while the much-expanded national security establishment has been largely successful at thwarting organized assaults by terrorists, it cannot prevent a one-off attack by an extremist-influenced sociopath. To do so would require turning our country into a police state. How many more of us will have to be presumed enemies of the state in order for the rest of us to be safe from random bombers? After an attack like this, national security ratchets up, and never seems to ratchet back down.Comments (204)Bob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowWho exactly does the NRA represent -- its card-carrying members who were mostly in favor of expanding background checks or the gun manufacturers who thrive on being able to easily sell their machines of death?Comments (735)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistTomorrow is rapidly becoming today. Although we may not often acknowledge it, climate change affects every one of us -- and all of us can affect climate change.Comments (29)Les LeopoldAuthor, \"How to Make a Million Dollars an Hour\" (Wiley 2013)The new Rich List is out -- yet another example of financial pornography. While nearly 15 million Americans still can\u0027t find jobs due to the Wall Street-created crash, the top hedge manager, David Tepper, earned $1,057,692 an HOUR in 2012.Comments (31)Rev. Mr. Michael Rogers, S.J.Jesuit DeaconDear Dzhokhar, I don\u0027t and can\u0027t hate you. I am glad you are in custody, but you are just a kid, and you are lost. I will love and pray for you.Comments (390)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Imagine that a substantial group of the most prominent astronomer insisted that the sun goes around the earth, as anyone can plainly see. There would likely be huge numbers of people who refused to accept that the earth goes around the sun. This is the state of modern economics.CommentsKareem Abdul-JabbarNBA Legend, Pop Culture columnistThe focus on wealth makes the show play out like a classic Shakespearean tragedy. The fabulous homes, clothes, and opulent parties at first make the viewers admire the housewife and wish to be like her. But soon we see the \"real\" person, whose hubris reveals a deep unhappiness that they, being unreliable narrators, deny.Comments (50)Alan DershowitzCriminal and civil liberties lawyerAll of this remains somewhat speculative at this early stage, but it is still worth asking why the government chose to charge him under the mass destruction statute rather than under the more obvious terrorist statute.Comments (11)Frances BeineckePresident, Natural Resources Defense CouncilIt\u0027s not in our national interest. It\u0027s a profit scheme for big oil. It would feed our addiction to fossil fuels, accelerate climate change and put our heartland farmers, ranchers and communities at risk. It needs to be denied.Comments (71)Alan RozenshteinThird-year student, Harvard Law SchoolWhat America deserves is a thorough, retrospective analysis of intelligence and counterterrorism efforts at all levels -- local, state, and federal. Congress was once a plausible institution for this kind of investigation, but these days the American public can be forgiven for lacking faith in Capitol Hill.CommentsEric E. Schmidt and Jared CohenIn the coming decades, five billion people -- the majority of humanity -- will come online for the first time, mostly in parts of the world ridden with conflict, instability and repression. We\u0027ve spent much of the last year traveling to those parts of the world to witness the new digital age firsthand.Comments (29)Gavin NewsomLieutenant Governor of CaliforniaIt is time for California to decriminalize, tax and regulate marijuana and decide who sells it, who can buy it legally, and for how much.Comments (12)Anthony D. RomeroExecutive Director of the American Civil Liberties UnionIt all began in Boston -- when a group of brave colonists resisted the yoke of a despotic king and sought freedom. Protecting Tsarnaev\u0027s constitutional rights is the best tribute we could give to the storied legacy of that great city where our freedoms and rights first took hold.Comments (484)Duane \u0027Dog\u0027 ChapmanStar, \u0027Dog and Beth: On the Hunt\u0027Today we have developed automatic and all kinds of crazy guns that our forefathers, if they were still alive, would not be okay with. Personally, I prefer to use non-lethal weapons. A gun is fine, but let\u0027s talk about the bullet.Comments (305)Daphne EviatarSenior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstAt least some members of Congress are clearly fed up with the administration\u0027s excessive secrecy about who the American government is killing and where exactly we\u0027re at war -- as they should be.CommentsMichael T. KlareAuthor and Professor of Peace and World-Security Studies, Hampshire CollegeTwo nightmare scenarios -- a global scarcity of vital resources and the onset of extreme climate change -- are already beginning to converge and in the coming decades are likely to produce a tidal wave of unrest, rebellion, competition, and conflict.Comments (12)Craig KanalleySenior Editor, Big News \u0026 Live Events, The Huffington PostNot everyone believes Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is a terrorist. Despite seemingly overwhelming evidence pointing toward his involvement in the Boston Marathon attack a week ago, there is a group of people who know Tsarnaev who are remaining loyal to the 19-year-old.Comments (11)Amb. Marc GinsbergFmr. U.S. Ambassador to Morocco \u0026 White House Middle East AdviserThe Northern Caucasus of Russia have for decades been an \"off-the-radar\" safe haven for Islamic salafist terrorism. Tamerlan Tsarnaev\u0027s alleged terrorism in Boston has changed all that.CommentsJohn DearChristian peace activist, author of \u0027Lazarus, Come Forth!\u0027 and \u0027A Persistent Peace.\u0027 www.johndear.orgFor the sake of Martin Richard, Martin King, Mahatma Gandhi, and all victims of violence, let\u0027s do our part to fulfill the dream of nonviolence by no longer hurting people and ending the policies, structures, institutions and systems which hurt people.Comments (53)John PavleyCTO @ The Huffington Post, BloggerThis week, starting with the tragic and sensless bombing of the Boston Marathon on Monday, through a riveting manhunt for two fugitive brothers, and ending in the death of one and apprehension of the other, Social Brother showed us just how powerful his genie (Internet mobile social photography) has become.CommentsJonathan R. WhiteLaw enforcement and military consultantIt\u0027s time for the media and news consumers to step away from drama. Americans need to understand the nature of modern terrorism.Comments (122)Simi Singh JunejaMother, writerHe could be my son: the oval face; the close-set dark eyes; the curly black hair; tall and lanky. My son was born in 1993, same as the Boston Bomber suspect. As a mother of a swarthy young man, I\u0027m always vigilant about the similarities in appearance of a terrorism suspect.Comments (205)Muqtedar KhanAssociate Professor of Islam and Global Affairs, the University of DelawareHow do we teach young Muslims to struggle for justice, but without resorting to terror tactics? How do we teach them that a just cause is not a justification for unjust means?CommentsWill StephenStaff Writer, College Humor; Contributor to The New YorkerJust five hours after the bombs went off, as survivors fought for their lives in emergency rooms and law enforcement scrambled through wreckage for their first real clues, Tsarnaev swiped open his iPhone and shot off an entirely unremarkable message.CommentsSen. Martin Heinrich and Sen. Chris MurphyWhat unites us is our commitment to protecting our environment and public health. Now, we are bringing our commitment to clean energy and combating climate change to the U.S. Senate. The environment shouldn\u0027t be a partisan or regional issue, it should be a national priority.Comments (26)David SchanzerAssociate Professor of the Practice, Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University, Director, Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland SecurityThe only legal, pragmatic, and effective way to handle this situation is to conduct a lengthy interrogation of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and then prosecute him in United States federal court.CommentsFrances OsborneBestselling author of The BolterAs a writer, I have indulged myself thoroughly in vicarious rule-breaking. I am not going to call it vicarious misbehavior because, quite frankly, the historical rules I write about, the rules that bound women, needed breaking -- though not always to the extent that they were.CommentsMichael HoganExecutive Arts and Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post Media GroupGandhi said, \"An eye for an eye will only make the whole world blind.\" But Muhammad Ali spoke for \"Game of Thrones\" when he said, \"You kill my dog, you better hide your cat.\" Yes, revenge is the theme of this week\u0027s episode. Everybody wants some.Comments (288)Bob HarrisAuthor, The International Bank of Bob: Connecting Our Worlds One $25 Kiva Loan at a Time (Walker/Bloomsbury)Now that our leaders have given Dr. Yunus a gold medal, perhaps they might more truly honor him by considering why.CommentsGigi RossBlogger, KludgyMomI think about the next female that might look over at him in a car. A faceless girlfriend. He is too adorable for words, with his dimples, endless brown eyes and that shaggy surfer hair that curls just right. He is no longer the fat baby who hated being in his car seat.CommentsGeorge TakeiSocial media starI was just five years old, and would spend much of my childhood behind barbed wire in that camp and, later, another in California called Tule Lake. One hundred twenty thousand other Japanese Americans from the West Coast suffered a similar fate.Comments (260)Lauren Hennessy, 2013.22.04Chris Weigant, 2013.22.04Deepak Chopra, 2013.22.04Walker Bragman, 2013.22.04Marcelo Giugale, 2013.22.04Randall Jenson, 2013.22.04Alan Rozenshtein, 2013.22.04Fahad Hassan, 2013.22.04Charlene Obernauer, 2013.22.04Nancy Rappaport, 2013.22.04Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"AMERICAN JUSTICE",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
