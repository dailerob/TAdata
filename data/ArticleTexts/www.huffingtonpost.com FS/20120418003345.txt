{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Founder and President, Constitutional Accountability CenterAs the Supreme Court\u0027s conservative majority stands poised at the edge of a cliff -- debating whether or not to strike down the Affordable Care Act and pick a very large fight with Congress and a sitting President -- two conservative judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit sought to push them over the edge last week. Their opinion -- a startling call for the abandonment of eight decades of Supreme Court case law in economic cases and a return to the pre-New Deal \"Lochner Era\" -- is the clearest roadmap yet as to what a conservative judicial revolution looks like.Read Post | Comments (13)Gordon Brown, 04/17/12Former Prime Minister of the United KingdomEvery child has a right to an education.

It\u0027s because they\u0027ve been collecting the lion\u0027s share of the growth for decades.Read Post | Comments (502)Anthony D. Romero, 04/17/12Executive Director of the American Civil Liberties UnionSo far in Election 2012, we\u0027ve seen a foul-mouthed Rush Limbaugh, men-only Congressional panels on women\u0027s rights, transvaginal probe laws and efforts to restrict women\u0027s access to contraception.

And I know this was a tiny, almost meaningless event. They weren\u0027t screaming, breaking each other\u0027s stuff or storming off in a huff. It was a far cry from fratricide. But their united front was cracked. That had never happened before.Read Post | CommentsLeo Hindery, Jr., 04/17/12Chairman, U.S. Economy/Smart Globalization Initiative at the New America FoundationAnyone who thinks we\u0027ve shut the barn door on misdeeds in the financial, commodities and futures markets apparently has never heard of the latest debacle, MF Global.

Jackie Speier, 04/17/12U.S. Congresswoman from California\u0027s 12th DistrictThere is cruel irony in having Equal Pay Day fall on Tax Day.
