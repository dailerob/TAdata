{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Award-Winning Author of Freestyle: Reflections on Faith, Family, Justice, and Pop Culture; Founding Pastor of Joy Tabernacle A.M.E. Church in Dallas, TexasTo date, no ISIS member or Syrian refugee has ever bombed or planned to bomb a black church or home. Nor have they walked into a Bible Study in the basement of a black church and unleashed a hail of bullets. Neither are they at fault for the continuing epidemic of unarmed black men, women, boys, and girls murdered by police officers in the streets of America. They have not turned our communities into militarized zones, nor have black people mysteriously died in their prisons. In our seeking forth for justice, let us not overlook the terror long lurking inside our own doors. For whole communities of Americans, the greatest terrorist threat is not now trying to enter our country. It has been here for a long time.The reality is that for the summit to succeed, business leaders must and will stand shoulder to shoulder with world leaders and play a critical supporting role in empowering national governments to agree a path to prosperity for us all.CEO, UnileverThe thin child with big sad eyes and a braid hanging down her back, the one holding a bag containing all her worldly possessions with one hand, and with the other she clutches her baby brother: that refugee girl was once me.SupermodelToday on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women las hermanas Mirabal of the Dominican Republic are honored by the United Nations.

But in the wealthiest nation in the world, more than half a million Americans sleep on the streets or spend their Thanksgiving in a homeless shelter. Many of them are children.Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban DevelopmentCharging Officer Van Dyke with murder is a critical step towards justice, but it can\u0027t be the beginning and end of this story. Some have used the fact that Officer Van Dyke has been charged with murder to advance the narrative that he was a \"bad apple\" acting outside the culture of the department.Deputy Legal Director and the Director of the Center for Justice, ACLUI am trying to stay above water. Trying not to drown in the poisonous pool of hate and ignorance. I am doing what I can, writing the op-eds, making sure the media hears our voices and continuing my daily work in pursuit of justice not only for my own community but for my sister communities.Palestinian-Muslim-American, Racial justice and civil rights activist, community organizer, media commentator, born and raised in Brooklyn.As we move forward, we must be vigilant -- to fairly allocate the burdens of who\u0027s called on to fight the war, to protect civil liberties, to protect innocent civilians abroad, to avoid hate and bigotry, and to fairly distribute the cost of paying for war. These aren\u0027t just worthy aims. They are also the foundations of our nation\u0027s strength.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027Ted Cruz is so thrilled that someone who wants abortion providers to be killed is supporting him that he actually sent out a press release to celebrate the endorsement. Is that what this Republican primary has come to? No one should tolerate calls to put someone to death because of his or her legal profession.Actress, Activist, People For the American Way Foundation Board MemberToday, we are faced with the same choice we have confronted in the past -- whether to give into fear and prejudice or align ourselves with our highest ideals.Founding Co-director, Social Security WorksThat Friday evening I was just beginning to lead a weekend retreat at the Kirkridge Retreat Center in East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, when we received word about the terrorist attacks in Paris.

What does this tell you about police leadership in Chicago?Creator of the CeaseFire Violence InterruptersIndividual rhetoric and singular action form policy and the norms of the institutions we build. A metaphor of abuse is not simply a rhetorical tool but an accurate assessment of our lives lived together here and now.Artist, writer, editor, obsessive book and record collector.Equality should be the standard for anyone in the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus. And Polis, Sinema and Maloney failed miserably at meeting that standard.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostI\u0027ve never had the privilege of visiting Idaho so I can\u0027t say that I know you. I don\u0027t know your specific fears or experiences and I would never presume to minimize or dismiss them. All I can say is that we\u0027re all Americans, and we share the ability to talk to each other with an open mind and an open heart.Truman National Security Fellow, civil servant in the U.S. Department of Defense and a graduate of Georgetown\u0027s School of Foreign ServiceThe people who broke into my home took a framed picture of my children that had been tucked away out of view and put it face down out in the open. This incident occurred as I\u0027m carrying out an investigative reporting project into Mexico\u0027s most high-profile human rights crime.Investigative journalistWhen we cook with a spiritual compass, we are cooking with intention in order minimize waste and be as efficient as possible. In America, we throw away roughly 40 percent of our food, but if you truly know how to cook, you know how to reuse food throughout the week in order to reduce waste and be cost-efficient.Award-Winning Chef, Restaurateur \u0026 AuthorThe Paris attacks have prompted people of all faiths and views to urge unity as a cure for terrorism. I agree that unity is a cure for terrorism. What I am less content with is that terrorism is the reason for unity. As long as fear is our motivation to unite, in the absence thereof we will also avoid unity.Professor of OntologyBy finally turning the spotlight onto multicultural heroes, brown kids can now see people who look like them be brave and powerful and white kids can see people who don\u0027t look like them be brave and powerful, too.Senior Editor, Huffington Post CanadaThis Monday, animal advocates released a shocking investigation showing widespread cruelty at what some would consider the most unlikely of places -- a top-rated Whole Foods turkey supplier.Researcher, effective altruist, advocateBringing down the monster won\u0027t be easy or happen quickly, even in the best-case scenario. It won\u0027t happen at all if we deny refuge to victims of Islamic State terror abroad and demonize Muslim-Americans at home. We\u0027re better and smarter than that -- or at least we should be.Lawyer, retired judge, novelist, columnist @truthdig and lecturer at USC Annenberg School of Communications. Progressive views on law and politics.Thanksgiving is a time for family, food and joy, but unfortunately it can also be a source of health-impacting stress and anxiety for many. Between the influx of visitors and the necessary shopping, cooking and cleaning up, there can be far too little time devoted to reflective conversation with friends and family.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorThis is the first Thanksgiving when our love is officially and legally recognized all across the country. Whether you\u0027re sitting around the table with Aunt Jane and Uncle Bob in Topeka or Tallahassee, you\u0027ve got the federal government on your side when they launch into their ignorant diatribe.Writer and LGBT advocateWhile I applaud the sentiment that Israelis and Palestinians are closely connected, what struck me the most is his characterization of himself, as if being a Jew means automatic support of Netanyahu\u0027s policies, regardless of how misguided they may be.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUIf you are like me, your maiden voyage into motherhood was accompanied by lots of advice. People you don\u0027t even know approach you to congratulate you. It\u0027s lovely, but then suddenly, they\u0027re uncaging hairy, snarling words like \"vaginal wall\" and \"third degree.\" Some things are better left unsaid.Wife, mama, doulaIf you\u0027re one of the millions of Bernie Sanders supporters around the United States, you\u0027ve heard skeptics, pundits, and naysayers talk about Bernie Sanders and minority voters.
