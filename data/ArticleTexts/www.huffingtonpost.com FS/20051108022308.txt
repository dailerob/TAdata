{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AP/Muhammed MuheisenFrom nytimes.comWhen the elder George Bush pardoned Cap Weinberger on the eve of his 1992 trial on charges that he had lied to Congress about Iran/Contra, he praised Weinberger as “a true American patriot” who “has rendered long and extraordinary service to our country”. George W used strikingly similar language when he accepted Libby’s resignation on October 28: “Scooter has worked tirelessly on behalf of the American people and sacrificed much in the service of this country.” Was he sending Cheney’s Cheney a not-so-subtle message? Is “service to this country” the new “they turn in clusters”? All the more reason for Senate Democrats to send the president the letter they are working on, calling on him to pledge that he won’t pardon Libby.READ POST | comments (17)11.07.2005 Bob CescaBush is either outright lying or the administration has a very different definition of torture than the rest of the world.
