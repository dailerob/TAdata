{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonLast June, we hosted our first-ever Third Metric conference at my apartment in New York. Based on the overwhelming response, we followed closely with similar events in New York, London, Munich and Hawaii. Now, Mika Brzezinski and I are taking the Third Metric on a three-city tour, with 2,000 to 3,000 attendees at each event. We will be in New York on April 24 and 25 at the New York City Center; in Washington, D.C., on May 1 and 2 at DAR Constitution Hall; and in L.A. on May 8 and 9 at the Dolby Theatre. By bringing together people who work in a range of fields -- from media, health care and technology to music, fashion and poetry -- we want to open up the conversation around our need to redefine success and provide everyone coming with us on this journey with the tools and tips they need to make real changes in their lives.CommentsRichard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future\"Different\"? Christie embodies his party perfectly. Arrogant? Check. Bullying? Check. Indifferent to the well-being of constituents? Check. He may sound like a different kind of Republican, but he governs the same way the others do. Meet the new GOP, same as the old GOP.CommentsRobert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, Beyond OutrageFor almost 40 years Republicans have pursued a divide-and-conquer strategy intended to convince working-class whites that the poor were their enemies. The big news is it\u0027s starting to backfire.Comments (205)Eric BoehlertSenior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaChristie\u0027s coverage has been a long-running, and rather extreme, case of personality trumping substance. But now the bridge bombshell casts all of that flattering coverage into question.Comments (30)Ambassador Gianna AngelopoulosConvening Sponsor, Clinton Global InitiativeThere are 26 million young people in the developed world who are not currently employed, in school or in training programs, according to the OECD. Forget losing weight or exercising more: Our most important resolution for 2014 needs to be solving the youth unemployment crisis.CommentsCarly PaulLiving in ColoradoThis is how I came to be in poverty\u0027s grip. It was not overnight, and it was not all because of me, and not all because a system that failed me, and not all because of a dysfunctional family, and not all because of overblown capitalism, and not all because of any one thing.Comments (217)Lance BassSinger, actor, producer, writer, entrepreneur and philanthropistFor my family, they still live in ground zero of intolerance for the LGBT community and have the unique pressure of having a well known gay relative. When I came out, they came out.Comments (154)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholar-Ish is, no doubt, convenient, the drive-thru of adjectives. I\u0027ll give it that. But, like a steady diet of fast food, -ish, not used in moderation, will catch up to you.CommentsRobert CreamerPolitical Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy Partners\"Bridgegate\" is a big, interesting, symbolically powerful story that will break through with voters who know very little about Christie. For many voters, it will be their first real impression and he will come to be defined by it.Comments (40)Susan WloszczynaFmr. entertainment reporter, USA TODAYOsage County is also a prime example of an ensemble cast where the female characters monopolize the goings-on, an Oscar-friendly staple that has been regaining favor of late after 2009\u0027s Precious and 2011\u0027s The Help became best-picture contenders.CommentsLauren DucaAssociate Entertainment Editor, The Huffington PostUltimately, Melissa and Mindy\u0027s covers are just examples. The world wouldn\u0027t be fixed if Melissa wore a bodycon minidress. There would still be prejudice and discrimination, if Mindy was featured in a full-length in all her glowing, brown glory.Comments (46)Rob ReinaldaWriter, 28 years in print journalismAs a professional writer/editor and a veteran actor, I\u0027d like to offer what I feel might be more accurate interpretations -- based on their syntax -- of what Chris Christie\u0027s two sentences actually meant, instead of simply buying into their verbal cloaks.CommentsJoseph A. PalermoProfessor, historian, authorToday, as Orwell predicted, we need a new political language. \"Reform\" is being used in our political discourse by the wealthy and corporate mouthpieces as code for privatizing and deregulating every public service they can get their greedy hands on.Comments (67)Michael T. KlareAuthor and Professor of Peace and World-Security Studies, Hampshire CollegeReservoirs of energy once considered inaccessible can be brought into production, and others once deemed exhausted can be returned to production; rather than being finite, the world\u0027s petroleum base now appears virtually inexhaustible.Comments (11)Peter Van BurenAuthor, \u0027We Meant Well\u0027 and the upcoming \u0027Ghosts of Tom Joad, A Story of the #99Percent\u0027Snowden, in a larger sense, in a good way, doesn\u0027t matter as a person. What matters is what he has revealed to us about a national security state that has clearly gone quite insane, violating our liberty and our freedom to live without unwarranted search and seizure of our private lives.CommentsRobert NaimanPolicy Director, Just Foreign PolicyIn the Republican House, for a bill to see action it generally has to satisfy something called the \"Hastert Rule.\" It certainly would be very appropriate for Majority Leader Reid to apply the Hastert Rule in this case.CommentsJoe Satran and Chloe SearcyIf you had to pick just four foods to eat for the rest of your life, what would they be?Comments (18)Peter WattsWriter, presenter, public speakerIf somewhere beneath the bonfire of your presentation, little kindling flames are delicately smouldering their way across the bridge of your presidential ambitions, then the thing you really shouldn\u0027t be doing, is blowing on them.CommentsHerbert LuiAuthor, marketing expertAmidst all the different types of meetings in a work day, and in order to wrestle with all the mental constraints we have to work with (e.g., perfectionism, anxiety, insecurity, etc.), a simple 10-minute walk can do wonders for the mind. Fresh air. A change in scenery.CommentsMary RobinsonPresident, Mary Robinson Foundation - Climate Justice; Fmr. President of IrelandIgnoring climate change is not consistent with the vision many people share of a world with greater equality, less poverty, the protection of human rights, more prosperity, jobs and opportunity. Climate change is a threat, but responding to it opens up a world of opportunity.Comments (40)Christine Gross-LohAuthor, Parenting Without Borders: Surprising Lessons Parents Around the World Can Teach UsThough parents around the world have the same goals, American parents like me (despite our very best intentions) have gotten it all backwards.Comments (1,242)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesIt was Time magazine that dreamed up the word \"outing\" back in 1990. Specifically, it was now-deceased William Henry III, a Pulitzer Prize-winning cultural critic, who coined the term to define what he saw as a terrible invasion of privacy against even the most vile and homophobic closeted public figures by gay activists and gay journalists, and, most pointedly, by me.Comments (169)Jenny WitteFounder and blogger, Mamatoga.comMinutes aren\u0027t all equal in my life as a mom. Some minutes are over faster than you can say \"THE BUS IS HERE!\" and some drag on, expanding tortuously, defying all logic and wearing at that last frayed nerve that is like an ancient rope suspension bridge connecting you to sanity over the raging waters of parenting chaos.CommentsSisterhood of the Sensible MomsEllen Williams and Erin DymowskiBills and responsibilities and weekly paychecks will all come soon enough, so have fun. Just not the kind of fun that requires bail money. May you have the wisdom to know the difference.CommentsAmb. Marc GinsbergFmr. U.S. Ambassador to Morocco \u0026 White House Middle East AdviserWhile recruiting a broad range of international actors, Kerry single-handedly has forced the actors to focus on a common framework to guide the ongoing talks. While Kerry still has his skeptics, he has everyone\u0027s admiration for his efforts. Well, almost everyone.CommentsJohn PrendergastCo-founder, Enough ProjectToday the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is holding a hearing on the urgent crisis unfolding in South Sudan. There are a number of specific things the U.S. can do to make a real difference in supporting peace.CommentsKathleen ReardonProfessor, USC Marshall School; Author, \u0027The Secret Handshake\u0027 and \u0027Shadow Campus\u0027Thanks to Apple shareholders, the company\u0027s board nominating committee will now be \"actively seeking out highly qualified women.\" Which raises the question: What has the committee been doing for more than three decades?CommentsLincoln Mitchelllincolnmitchell.comBefore we address income inequality, we must recognize that it is a problem and that, for example, this is now a country where most children born into poverty live their whole lives in poverty and where the opportunities enjoyed by the children of the wealthy are dramatically different from those of poor children.Comments (42)William BradleyPolitical AnalystI like Robert Gates. He\u0027s a professional, a grown-up. He\u0027s a thoughtful, reasonable Republican at a time when such are overshadowed by something very different. I agree with him on many things. But his \"Mission Impossible\" assignment to salvage Iraq and Afghanistan is blinding him.Comments (24)Adam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; co-founder of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911Not to be a buzzkill, but allow me to assume my Shiva God of Death persona for just a moment and remind you of the risks inherent in the decision to open your home (indeed, your life) to a complete stranger.CommentsDr. Mark Dybul and Dr. Julio FrenkEmerging powers are well positioned to have an enormous impact on the regions in which they reside as well as on the global stage. They should maximize this impact in positive and mutually beneficial ways, helping to lead and support strategies for global and regional growth.CommentsKathryn Sollmann, 2014. 9.01Denny Dressman, 2014. 9.01Alan de Queiroz, 2014. 9.01Brad Friedman and Desi Doyen, 2014. 9.01Shira Lazar, 2014. 9.01Geoffrey R.
