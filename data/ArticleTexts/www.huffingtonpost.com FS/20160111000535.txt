{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, the new year kicked off with Donald Trump releasing his first TV ad, cramming in all the xenophobia, \"pants on fire\" mendacity and ugliness that have marked his campaign so far: calls for a temporary shutdown of Muslims entering the U.S., a wall to keep out Mexicans and a vow to \"CUT THE HEAD OFF OF ISIS.\" While no one would accuse Trump of being a student of history, he\u0027s drawing on a deep American tradition of campaign fear mongering. It\u0027s the same playbook that gave us \"welfare queens,\" Willie Horton, and, more recently, a decade-long disaster in Iraq. This isn\u0027t to say cynically pandering to people\u0027s lizard-brain fear center isn\u0027t effective -- it got Bush reelected in 2004 -- but it comes with a high cost. When we operate from fear, we push our reason into the background. And if we\u0027re going to make progress in this new year in solving our biggest problems, it\u0027s going to be by using our wisdom, not our fear.As a proud, responsible gun owner, I paid close attention to the president\u0027s speech outlining his executive actions on guns and studied the written proposal put forth by the White House carefully. I can\u0027t not support them.Emmy Award-winning television personality, decorated former Naval officer, inspirational speaker, author, entrepreneurBe specific, stop the loggers. Climate Revolution is working with the charity, Cool Earth; working with indigenous people they are ring-fencing the forest to stop the loggers and so protect the interior.Fashion designer and activistBy taking away the city\u0027s clean drinking water in order to \"cut costs\" and then switching the city\u0027s water supply to Flint River water, you have allowed massively unsafe levels of pollutants and lead into the water that travels in to everyone\u0027s home. Every Flint resident is trapped by this environmental nightmare which you, Governor, have created.Oscar and Emmy-winning DirectorNo one ought to have the right to manufacture and sell weapons of mass destruction to anyone other than the military, and those weapons should not be able to leave a military base under penalty of law.Actress and authorThese are some of the things that are making people uncomfortable both in and about the Valley. None of these issues are anyone\u0027s fault. It\u0027s just the market at work -- the capital market, the market for talent, the real estate market.Founder and CEO, Venture for AmericaTo understand the source of the Bundy\u0027s self-righteous anger, it\u0027s helpful to examine their religious views, which are rooted in a maverick strain of fundamentalism found throughout rural Oregon, Wyoming, Idaho, Colorado, Utah, Arizona and Nevada.Author, \u0027Missoula\u0027Many, many people suffering from mental illness, including those who have experienced psychosis and hallucinations or who have lived through suicidal moments or even attempts, go on to live successful, productive lives. All we need to do is let them. Because it\u0027s not helping the mentally ill that we should fear. It\u0027s what happens if we don\u0027t.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarTwo powerful universities whose wrongdoings were exposed in The Hunting Ground have gone to great lengths to attack the accounts of survivors: Harvard Law, which protected an assailant who was repeatedly found to have committed assault, and Florida State University, which covered up a rape investigation of its star quarterback.Filmmaker, \"The Hunting Ground\"Filmmaker, \"The Hunting Ground\"Never did I consider that something so unthinkable -- selling kids for sex -- was happening in my own community. But I was wrong. I was naive. I was unwilling to face the facts. Until last year.ActressThe current fight will play out not in Saudi Arabia or Iran, but in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen. Diplomatic breakthrough to these conflicts depends on the willingness of Saudi Arabia and Iran to pressure their proxies to make peace. The current enmity will make that nearly impossible for the foreseeable future.President, Eurasia Group; Author, \u0027Superpower: Three Choices for America’s Role in the World\u0027Chairman, Eurasia GroupPresident Obama has taken the moral high ground when others would not. He has listened to the American people who are crying out for the carnage to stop when Congress would not. He has decided to be on the right side of history when others would not. He has decided to save lives when other leaders would not.Parents of Aurora victim Jessica GhawiToday, Republicans in Congress plan to make history. Not for growing the economy or helping the middle class -- but for sending a bill to President Obama that will defund women\u0027s health care and hurt millions of Americans.U.S. Representative, Maryland\u0027s eighth congressional districtThese new measures will not prevent every shooting that snuffs out the lives of nearly seven children to gun violence daily, but they will save many lives and help staunch the relentless plague of gun violence that terrorizes our nation\u0027s homes, schools and communities.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundFuture economic historians may not call the period that began in 2007 \"The Greatest Depression.\" But as of now it is highly and increasingly probable that they will call it \"The Longest Depression.\" So what can be done?Professor of economics, U.C. BerkeleyThe daily shootings in America\u0027s inner cities are all too frequent reminders of the tragic impact of gun violence on our national well-being. Some studies suggest that repeated exposure to shootings in urban areas is akin to the trauma suffered by soldiers in war zones.Congressional Black Caucus Health Braintrust Chair, health equity advocate, representative for Illinois\u0027 2nd District.Iran is no paragon of democracy. And when its leaders denounce the \"criminal workings\" of the \"vile\" Saudi regime and its links to terrorism, the pot is calling the kettle black. Yet what occurred this past weekend in Saudi Arabia is worrisome for several reasons. Executing 47 people in a single day is a strange way to begin the year.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.The killing of Sheikh Al-Nimr should serve as a prime moment for the U.S. to reconsider its alliance with the Saudi regime, a regime that not only denies human rights to its own people but exports death and destruction abroad.Co-founder, CODEPINK: Women for PeaceA wave of pessimism leads capable people to underestimate the power of their voice and the strength of their ideals. The truth is this: It is the initiatives of deeply caring people that provide the firmament for our democracy.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorAuntie Rosa wanted to ensure the constitutional rights of all Americans. These men want public land turned over for private uses. Auntie Rosa was willing to go to jail for her beliefs. These men hide behind guns.Contributor, \u0027Our Auntie Rosa\u0027Award-winning reporter and freelance journalistHere\u0027s the bottom line: The middle class is in crisis, and Secretary Clinton\u0027s proposals merely tinker at the margins of that crisis. They would not shift the fundamental direction of an economy that is growing more unequal every day.Co-Director, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureIf nuclear war happened today, it wouldn\u0027t be two blocks of states challenging each other in a deadly arms race, but also the \"new kids on the nuclear block,\" such as India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea.Executive Director, International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear WeaponsFor the established Republican order, the vista presented by this new year is filled with bewilderment and foreboding.Novelist and contributing opinion writerBody image and perception issues do not go away just because one is working out.Business Reporter, The Huffington PostThis should be a \"have you no decency?\" moment, but sadly, we shouldn\u0027t be surprised that that no candidate has stood up to Trump\u0027s ad in any meaningful way. They\u0027re not speaking out because they are in lock step, following Trump\u0027s lead.President, People For the American WayYears later, when I wrote my book The Only Way Out Is Through, I realized how these very steps suggested by my professor were the same steps needed to re-enter the workplace. Here are the steps to help you re-enter the workplace after loss:Human Behavior, Parenting, and Education Expert, Speaker, Author. Ph.D., Ed.D., M.Ed.The chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, Roy Moore, is once again trying to ban marriages for gays and lesbians in his state, handing down an order directing probate judges to stop issuing licenses.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostFor most women, whose lives have not been perfect, Sec. Clinton\u0027s career path -- which has been marked by persistence and resilience in the face of extraordinary barriers -- is cause for celebration and inspiration.President, National Organization for WomenI\u0027m not saying what happened wasn\u0027t dangerous, but the fact is Koreans in less than a day have turned away from that news. To be honest, even the day it happened, people here didn\u0027t make a huge fuss about it.Editor in Chief, HuffPost KoreaSo who are Marc Short and Andy Koenig? The Times identified them only as \"the president and senior policy adviser, respectively, at Freedom Partners, which advocates for free-market policies.\"Senior Writer, Union of Concerned ScientistsI am challenging myself to have lunch away from my desk for one week to see what this simple, yet often overlooked, lunch break business is all about.
