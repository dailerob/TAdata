{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Chief financial writer, The Huffington PostThe chart says pretty much everything about how ridiculously uneven this \"recovery\" has been. It exposes how most of the benefit of the recovery has gone to employers, not employees. Corporate profits have hit record highs, and so have stock prices. Wages have stagnated, meanwhile, and low-wage jobs have accounted for most of the job growth in the recovery. This isn\u0027t just happening in the U.S. -- it\u0027s a problem around the world. It\u0027s partly due to technological advances, partly due to jobs being shipped to where labor is the absolute cheapest, and partly due to policies designed to shovel more income to the top 1 percent, to name a few. The end result is that more wealth keeps flowing to the owners of capital, rather than to labor, just as French economist Thomas Piketty warned us.For the past 48 hours, every time I\u0027ve gone to that sad place about the unexpected -- unfathomable -- passing of my friend, Joan Rivers, I\u0027ve found myself, just a few moments later, beginning to laugh.Award-winning actress, author and activistFaith Jegede speaks passionately about the beauty of being different in this short, inspiring ode to her two autistic brothers. Forget being normal, she says: Be extraordinary.\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"Thank you on behalf of all comedians working today who know that you always fought the enemies of comedy. You controlled the room always, in the most professional way. You leveled the playing ground for all comedians. You\u0027ll be missed, but not forgotten. Copied but never matched. Never bested.Presidential Candidate, Peace and Freedom PartyUnless we use our democratic vote to bring honesty and excellence back to politics, America\u0027s decline will become irreversible. That\u0027s why I\u0027m here today, to endorse New York Governor and Lieutenant Governor candidates Zephyr Teachout and Tim Wu.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \"To Move the World: JFK\u0027s Quest for Peace\"Buried within the bankruptcy of Detroit is a fundamental political and moral question: Who are \"we,\" and what are our obligations to one another?Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027As our country moves forward with awareness and acknowledgment of the epidemic of rape on campus, someone\u0027s been left behind: our college men.President, The New AgendaIt is crucial that a binding and meaningful agreement is generated by this summit -- we can still avoid the worst of what climate change will mean if we face the facts -- and each other. There are solutions that need to be brought on line and scaled up now.Writer, Producer, DirectorAcross the country it\u0027s back to school time. I hope it is a year full of promise and not disappointment and added stress for all children -- especially those most vulnerable. I also hope this school year begins with a renewed commitment to help every child succeed.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe ISIS challenge is, at its core, a war of ideas. We need to recognize that while it is possible to destroy an ideology, doing so is not easy, and it cannot be done without an effective, fully supported counter message.Director, Center on Congress at Indiana UniversityWith a Democratic president, many talkers from 2004 now turn their attention, and their wrath, to Pennsylvania Avenue and use the deaths as a cudgel to bash the president as being impotent -- i.e. \"He didn\u0027t prevent the deaths!\" Of course neither did Bush, but the Fox rules of propaganda were different for him.Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaHow did Africa\u0027s health systems come to be so weak? Didn\u0027t the United States and other major donors just spend billions of dollars on global health in Africa?DrPHWhile these terrorists insist they are governing under Islamic law and are carrying out their atrocities in the name of Allah, they are nothing but thugs and assassins who are desecrating a religion and blaspheming the name of Allah.Founder and Chairman, The Cordoba InitiativeIt\u0027s all too familiar, from the blaming of the victim to the community outcry, and is yet another example of how this nation has long devalued the lives of its black citizens. Instead of trust and healing, the streets of Ferguson were full of tear gas and militarized police.Co-Director, Advancement ProjectOver two nights, our conversation covered many things -- her devotion to her family, her legendary work ethic, her delight in making people laugh -- and then it took on what turned out to be a prescient dimension.PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorIn a surprisingly downbeat look at last month\u0027s job market, today\u0027s jobs report shows payrolls up only 142,000 in August, a downward revision to June\u0027s gain, flat weekly hours, and a slight tick down in the labor force.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorFollowing several Supreme Court decisions, which removed most of the remaining limits to the amounts of money special interests can contribute to election campaigns, selling legislation has become even more prevalent. We are moving from one-person, one-vote to a system that is centered around one-dollar, one-vote.Professor of international relations, George Washington UniversityWhile Libya may not make the front page on a daily basis, it stands as the latest example of blowback, the adverse consequences of our reflexive military intervention.Former 16-year member of the U.S. Congress and two-time U.S. presidential candidateJay Z\u0027s music has always expressed love for a little liquid refreshment. With his late night spot The 40/40 club offering custom cocktails and single malts, it is clear that Mr. Carter takes his drinking seriously. Here are Jay Z\u0027s seven favorite types of booze -- from popping Champagne to sipping on the good stuff.Liquor.comDress codes have less to do with sexy than with social order. They are like sumptuary laws, frequently, unconsciously or not, designed to protect a sexist, frequently racist and homophobic status quo and kids know it.Feminist, writer, and satirist (not always in that order)Economic inequality in South Africa is now greater than it was even during the days of apartheid, and gender violence is rampant. So these are the new agendas of a new generation: economic liberation and gender equality, with a commitment to lead on both in the churches.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersIf the minimum wage had kept pace with increases in productivity since 1968, it would be $21.72. Instead, corporations and wealthy individuals have kept those gains for themselves.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourThere\u0027s a new fad on Facebook: people are making lists of books that \"changed their thinking.\" I\u0027m impressed and pleased that people are publicly expressing their love for the written word but I have to call all of you out: stop lying, you lying liars.Editor, Huffington Post TechThe function of Ex-Im is to subsidize businesses that export American products. The major problem with this agency comes from the fact that a big bulk of Ex-Im funds go to huge, wealthy companies, such as the Ex-Im\u0027s largest beneficiary Boeing, which in 2013 received 30 percent of its loans and guarantees.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorAs surely -- if not as enthusiastically -- as his predecessor, Obama has succumbed to the powerful systemic pressures that serve the needs of the military-intelligence-industrial complex. Secrecy is rampant. Politics drives policy. There is no accountability.Senior Writer, The InterceptWhat is starkly noticeable in the wake of Rivers\u0027 death is how much has changed for funny ladies since Rivers first walked onto the Tonight Show stage in 1965.An award-winning freelance writer covering religion, culture \u0026 philanthropy.If you want a case study in humanity, 30-year-old single guys have pretty much all the bases covered.waitbutwhy.comThere is one thing that I have been itching to take a stand on -- online and offline -- and it\u0027s something I am not willing or able to respect any asshole opinions on: my daughter is gay and I think that\u0027s perfectly fine.Freelance writer and small business consultantScientists compared the differences in genes between friends and strangers across nearly 2,000 people and they found that friends tend to have a more similar set of genes than strangers. Perhaps it\u0027s \"The Starbucks Effect\" -- if two people like the smell of coffee maybe they\u0027re more likely to hang out together.Professor of Immunology, University of Manchester, author of \"The Compatibility Gene: How Our Bodies Fight Disease, Attract Others, and Define Ourselves\"In our rush to return to war in Iraq we are playing into the Islamic State\u0027s hands, just as we played into the hands of al Qaeda in Iraq in 2004 and into Osama bin Laden\u0027s larger strategy with our morally disastrous Global War on Terror.Senior Fellow, Center for International Policy; Board of Directors, Council for a Livable World; MatthewHoh.comHeart disease affects about 43 million women per year. It\u0027s time to demand that the research include women in the proportion to which women exist in our population.Cardiologist, AuthorGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"CUOMO DISSES DEBATES!",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
