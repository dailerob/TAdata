{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Stress -- it\u0027s one of the most harmful forces in our lives. It can damage our health, our relationships, our careers, our marriages and even curb our creativity. That\u0027s why I\u0027m happy to announce that all 13 of our lifestyle sections -- from Travel and Parents to Weddings and Divorce -- have an editorial mission to help our readers travel with less stress, parent with less stress, get married with less stress and, yes, get divorced with less stress. And today our books section is launching \"Turn the Page on Stress,\" a HuffPost Books project tapping into the de-stressing potential of books and storytelling, opening up the conversation to HuffPost editors, our community of bloggers and authors with insights on the written word\u0027s unique capacity to transport and transform. Even with all the high-tech gadgets at our disposal, the timeless act of reading is a way to connect with ideas and with the past, but also with ourselves.Read Post | Comments (61)Aaron Belkin, 11/08/12Author, \u0027How We Won: Progressive Lessons from the Repeal of \"Don\u0027t Ask, Don\u0027t Tell\"\u0027As the planet continues to warm and the seas continue to rise with no chance of a meaningful policy response from Washington, perhaps it is time for Senator Reid to do whatever he can to gut this antiquated and anti-democratic rule.Read Post | CommentsRobert Creamer, 11/07/12Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersTuesday\u0027s election will certainly benefit millions and millions of people -- both in the United States and around the world. But beyond the many important short and mid-term consequences, it will likely be remembered as an inflection point in American political history.Read Post | Comments (911)Mark Cuban, 11/08/12Owner, Dallas Mavericks; Chairman, HDNetWhen we got to the last week before the election, I noticed a subtle change in the branding of this election by Fox. Outside of Bill O\u0027Reilly and Chris Wallace, Fox was relentless in sending the message that a Romney win was imminent.Read Post | Comments (531)Jim Wallis, 11/08/12Christian leader for social changeThe results of the presidential election showed how dramatically a very diverse America is changing; people are longing for a vision of the common good that includes everyone.Read Post | Comments (80)Kelly Rigg, 11/08/12Executive Director, GCCAAfter a blistering summer, record Arctic sea ice melt and now Hurricane Sandy, let\u0027s hope that the president is prepared to turbo-charge the growing momentum for action.Read Post | Comments (223)Jacob Soboroff, 11/08/12Host/Producer, HuffPost LiveIf Barack Obama leads the way, the United States of America can go from one of the countries with the worlds worst voter turnouts to the best.

El-Erian, 11/08/12CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOWe should feel a mix of great sadness and heightened concern upon seeing the latest unemployment numbers out of Greece.Read Post | Comments (134)Neil S. Siegel, 11/08/12Professor of law and political science and co-director of the Program in Public Law at Duke Law SchoolNetworks like CNN had a significant financial stake in portraying the election as neck-and-neck. There\u0027s nothing like ginning up viewers and ratings for the bottom line. Economic self-interest. Now that\u0027s the sort of cynicism that makes some sense to me.Read Post | Comments (138)Richard Socarides, 11/08/12Attorney and former White House adviser under President ClintonIt has been \"Washington groupthink\" that gay issues are dangerous for elected officials, even ones who are sympathetic to our cause.

And to give Boehner and whatever moderate voices are left in the GOP some leverage over the crazies in their midst.Read Post | Comments (191)Bill Whitmore, 11/07/12CEO, AlliedBarton Security ServicesAs we approach Veteran\u0027s Day, I ask my fellow CEOs if they are doing enough to ensure they are hiring and nurturing America\u0027s heroes.
