{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Fellow, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesWith the Super Committee meeting, it\u0027s time to determine how we should speak about the economy. Some commentators like to analogize government spending to a swimming pool, as if you can only take water from one end and dump it in the other end of the same pool.

But then they turned to deep sadness over the terrible cost of a war that was always wrong: intellectually, politically, strategically and, above all, morally.Read Post | Comments (81)Van Jones and Jakada Imani, 10/26/11This kind of crackdown we\u0027re seeing in Oakland is bad for our democracy, and it\u0027s bad for public safety.
