{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersSince the outbreak of civil war in Syria, hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in the conflict between the brutal regime of Bashar al-Assad, equally brutal jihadist groups such as ISIS, and other rebel groups opposed to Assad\u0027s rule. Many refugees from Syria have ended up in neighboring countries, but an increasing number are making often dangerous journeys to reach Europe. What is happening in Europe makes me think about our own country\u0027s hopelessly broken immigration system. There are uncomfortable parallels in the two situations. Like the Syrian refugees, many Central American men, women, and children have fled the violence and poverty of countries like El Salvador and Guatemala in search of safety and a better life in the United States. We must fight to finally fix a broken system.On September 11 I will arise remembering those with whom I served, those first responders in New York, Pennsylvania and Washington, DC, and the victims of that terrible day in our nation\u0027s history.

With the fastest global population-growth projection, and a sizable small- and medium-size enterprise sector, accounting for 90 percent of Sub-Saharan African businesses, Goal 8 will have particular impact on Africa.Chair of the United Nations Foundation, Global Entrepreneurship Council, and Executive Chairman of Mara SokoniWhile some naysayers gleeful claim that Bernie Sanders isn\u0027t a Democrat, they conveniently forget that he stood up for liberal principles when they weren\u0027t popular, and when Democrats like Hillary Clinton aligned themselves with the GOP. Clinton had the same intelligence as Sanders, but made the wrong decision after 9/11.Columnist published in The Cleveland Plain Dealer, The Baltimore Sun, The Hill, Salon, The Jerusalem Post www.hagoodman.comBlack lives, a durable fiber of our nation\u0027s history, are also fraying due to stresses beyond the criminal justice system, with many of the root causes directly related to health.Physician, healthcare innovator, and cultural enthusiastSince 9/11, Africa has increasingly been viewed by the Pentagon as a place of problems to be remedied by military means. And year after year, as terror groups have multiplied, proxies have foundered, and allies have disappointed, the U.S. has doubled down again and again.Managing Editor, TomDispatch.comThe pattern of violence against minority communities in America does not emerge in a vacuum.

Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and IDT911It was his work at Ground Zero that left my father clinging to life just seven years later. If I\u0027ve learned anything in the years since 9/11 (seven of them I was lucky enough to still have my father for), it\u0027s the weight of an \"I love you,\" and the importance of \"How was your day?\"Writer. Thinker. Bad hand-shaker.Fourteen years after the attacks that ushered in this new American age of angst, we are torn between the loftiness of our aspirations, and the reality of our constraints. Sadder but (hopefully) wiser, we struggle to navigate the turbulent waters of an uncertain future, while wistfully recalling a serene past that is no more.Psychologist, Investigator, National Center for the Study of Terrorism and the Response to Terrorism, University of MarylandWe\u0027re not even two years removed from the last time the Tea Party wing of the Republican Party held Congress hostage and forced the federal government to shut down for 16 days. Sadly, the wheels are already in motion for another shutdown.Has represented south central Wisconsin in Congress since 2012.Over the last several weeks, many have learned of the workplace experiences of white collar workers at Amazon. For lawyers, however, this wasn\u0027t news. For some, the stories of white collar work at Amazon just described their professional life for the last 30 years or so.Associate Professor of Law, Albany Law SchoolStigmas largely exist because mental illness remains misunderstood and at times sensationally stereotyped. Depression is often seen as the precursor to suicidal ideation and behavior so let\u0027s take a look at some dangerous myths about men and depression.Psychologist, author \"Intimate Partner Violence: A Culturally Competent Model for Treatment and TrainingBecause of something called carried interest, the top 25 hedge fund mangers paid a lower tax rate than the average kindergarten teacher in 2014. Billionaire hedge fund managers don\u0027t need a tax break, and there is no reason this loophole should exist.109th Mayor of New York CityMore than a dozen GOP governors wrote a letter to President Barack Obama, vowing to keep state-level sanctions on Iran despite the nuclear deal. But can a state really circumvent the U.S. President\u0027s policy on sanctions? A U.S. Supreme Court case from several years ago could block that plan.Political science professor, LaGrange College in GeorgiaI understand 14 years of struggling to define who I am in a world that for some reason still believes in collective punishment is absolutely nothing compared to the infinite void the friends and families of all the victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and similar horrific incidents face.Editor-in-Chief, ReadCONTRA MagazineAs a national security expert who has spent more than 20 years working alongside government defense and security experts, I know that the majority of Syrian refugees fleeing war are not using the opportunity of refugee status to embed themselves as terrorists in the West.Author of Talking to TerroristsA cartoonish dictator out of a Gilbert and Sullivan comic opera runs a not-so funny junta which jails opponents and suppresses free speech. The recent bombing of a popular Hindu shrine in Bangkok should act as the famed fire bell in the night.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteAt 17, my high school friend Taylor broke her back. Without authorization she became a paraplegic poster child, reiterating her story to friends and entitled strangers alike again and again.

Wean yourself off of the scale. The number on it means absolutely nothing. It is not an indicator of how you feel or how you look. It tells you nothing of importance. If you are weighing yourself everyday, stop.Founder of Live More Weigh LessI am a woman in a man\u0027s profession, and it\u0027s certainly time that the prevalence of societal sex-stereotyping is publicly addressed. We begrudgingly accept this level of misogyny and anti-family sentiment when it\u0027s subtle, constitutive and mixed with praise for being tough. After all, this is surgery. And surgeons are tough.Breast cancer surgeon, mom, wife.I am not an addict. But try and love one, and then see if you can look me square in the eyes and tell me that you didn\u0027t get addicted to trying to fix them. If you\u0027re lucky, they recover.
