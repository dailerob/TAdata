In fact, I have frequently and publicly chastised political liberals for ceding the language of faith and spirit to those on the far right. What troubled me about the political televangelists of the day was not that they were encouraging fellow conservative Christians to get involved in politics, but that they disparaged the faith and patriotism of people who didn\u0027t share their religious beliefs and right-wing political views.

I want to be the father that spent quality time with his kid and created memories that last for a lifetime.International PR Expert on Emerging Markets, Bestselling Business Author and CEO at P WorldRegardless of whether a domestic abuser is a boyfriend, spouse, ex-spouse, or father of his victim\u0027s child, that person should obviously lose the privilege of gun ownership. We must address the very real dangers of guns in dating violence and domestic abuse by closing the \"boyfriend loophole.\"Host of \"Dr. America\" on We Act Radio, pediatrician in Washington DC, member of the National Physicians AllianceBeing busy has somehow become a badge of honor. The prevailing notion is that if you aren\u0027t super busy, you aren\u0027t important or hard working. The truth is, busyness makes you less productive.Author of #1 bestselling book, Emotional Intelligence 2.0, and president of TalentSmart, world\u0027s leading provider of emotional intelligence.While it may be tempting to dismiss me as a single-issue voter with a narrow view of the world, consider whether there is one other issue whose poisonous vines stretch so broadly across every inch of our national landscape: public health, the economy, national security, civil rights, crime, family life, and education.Director of the Legal Professionals Program, Hazelden Betty Ford FoundationBoth papers have substantially underrepresented the number of civilians killed in drone strikes in Pakistan and Yemen, failed to correct the public record when evidence emerged that their reporting was wrong and ignored the importance of international law.Independent source of news and analysis, from the academic and research community.That Asian Americans voted in higher numbers for the Democratic Party in 2012 than any other point in history should have sounded a major alarm to Republican candidates.Attorney, New York City; Former Leadership Institute Fellow at Center for American ProgressThe Benghazi investigation has gone on longer than the investigation into Watergate.
