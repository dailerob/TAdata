Then, worries about Hurricane Irene caused the postponement of today\u0027s official dedication of the Martin Luther King, Jr. memorial. The arc of the moral universe is not only long, it\u0027s susceptible to high winds. Elsewhere: Steve Jobs stepped down, DSK walked free, and Libyan rebels ransacking Gaddafi\u0027s compound found an album filled with photos of Condoleezza Rice, with whom Gaddafi once shared a private dinner, showering the Secretary of State with an estimated $212,000 worth of gifts -- including a diamond ring, a lute, and a locket with Gaddafi\u0027s picture inside.

Hansen Clarke, 8/27/11Congressman from Michigan\u0027s 13th Congressional DistrictMartin Luther King was neither a president nor a war hero, but a humble preacher forced to live as an outsider in his own community.
