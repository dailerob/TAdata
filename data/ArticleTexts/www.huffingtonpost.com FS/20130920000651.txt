Although SNAP benefits are modest (an average of less than $1.50 per person per meal), SNAP is the nation\u0027s foremost tool against hunger and hardship, particularly during recessions and periods of high unemployment. Currently, 47 million Americans benefit from SNAP, but that number is expected to be greatly reduced once the economy recovers. SNAP is designed to expand in periods of great need and contract when the economy is better. Is it ignorance of how deep the problem of \"food insecurity\" or hunger is in America now? Is it just ideology against government per se? Because many poor people do have to turn for help to their governments, anti-government rhetoric can often turn to anti-poor rhetoric.Comments (37)Paul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostPope Francis continues to radically refocus the Catholic Church and, even as a non-Catholic, I am beginning to view him as a personal pastor.CommentsJosh HorwitzExecutive Director, Coalition to Stop Gun ViolenceWhen individuals like Aaron Alexis are not prohibited purchasers under existing federal law, it is obvious that universal background checks alone are not enough. We need to have a national discussion about expanding the disqualifying criteria.Comments (38)Matt WalshBlogger, talk radio host, father of twinsYou had this expression like you were expecting a high five. \"Yeah, put it here, dude, you really told that young mother and her 3-year-old off! Nice!\" Is that how you thought I\u0027d respond?Comments (991)Pam OmidyarFounder and board chair, Humanity UnitedTwo years after Sudan split, the important central border region of Abyei remains contested between the governments and communities of a divided Sudan and a newly independent South Sudan.CommentsKristin Kirkpatrick, M.S., R.D., L.D.Manager of Wellness Nutrition Services at Cleveland Clinic Wellness InstituteWhile most of us know that sugar is not the best substance to load our body with, many individuals struggle with tactics in actually breaking free of their addiction to sugar -- and yes, it can truly be an addiction.Comments (76)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesIn saying \"I have never been a right-winger\" in the same interview in which he\u0027s criticizing the church for being too \"obsessed\" with gay marriage and abortion, Francis is hitting at those Catholic leaders who use gay rights and abortion to wield political power, putting them on notice.Comments (33)Lorraine Devon WilkeWriter of Sass \u0026 SensibilityWith yet another mass shooting to ponder, let\u0027s please not bother to talk about gun control. Though it might be worth it to ask ourselves why we are such a violent nation.Comments (506)Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCONo matter how hard you look, there is only one major factor that can consistently explain this week\u0027s market moves. And it centers on expectations of Fed policy.Comments (115)Richie FriemanHost, Modern Manners GuyBeing an extrovert, I consider myself a pretty easy person to get along with. I\u0027m good at fitting into most situations, even when dealing with the many oddballs I\u0027ve encountered throughout my career.Comments (130)Kathleen PeddicordPublisher, Live and Invest OverseasIf budget is a top concern, following are seven destinations where you should be focusing your attention. You could live in each of these places on a budget of $1,200 per month or less. (Note, coincidentally, that that\u0027s the amount of the average Social Security payment.)Comments (159)John MichaelFreelance Writer \u0026 Perpetual StudentMore than any other demographic, seniors are poised to be the biggest pot users in America should cannabis be legalized. It\u0027s law-abiding adults who will begin using pot in greater numbers, and the associated lameness of watching their parents ripping a bong will, if anything, probably decrease teen use.Comments (433)Gavin NewsomLieutenant Governor of CaliforniaHow many people have to die before we realize that the only thing the truly stops a bad guy is not letting them get their hands on a gun in the first place?Comments (1,081)Samantha FieldBlogger; Progressive, liberal ChristianThere have been plenty of things I\u0027ve heard since I left Christian fundamentalism after spending 14 years (more than half my life) in it, and most of them make me want to tear my hair out.Comments (36)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activist\"Awareness\" is a loaded word. It subtly suggests to us that we might need open our eyes a little wider, primarily when it comes to issues that may have slipped beneath our radar. And I\u0027m always grateful when these efforts are connected with important medical issues, especially this month, which is devoted to Pediatric Cancer Awareness.CommentsRichard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureWhat the Republicans are attempting to do is both un-Constitutional and a violation of their own sworn promise -- an oath sworn on the Bible they claim to revere. Their consciences must decide whether their behavior is un-Godly, but the Constitution they swore to uphold makes it pretty plain that it\u0027s un-American.Comments (288)Ruma BoseConsultant, serial entrepreneur, investor, philanthropist and authorIf we do not make this issue a priority, we risk seeing an entire generation of people cursed to be marginalized at work - and because so much else depends on having a decent job, marginalized in society, too.CommentsTom Frieden, MD, MPHDirector, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)In a society where women are often judged by their looks, Terrie did not hide the scars on her face caused by smoking. With her raspy voice, she was able to rekindle the awareness of the American people to the continued suffering caused by smoking.CommentsMattea Kramer and Miriam PembertonRight now is a rare moment when two pieces of bad news Americans are accustomed to hearing could be converted into one piece of very good news.Comments (23)Jason SaltmarshCompetitive masters runnerMy running actually looked a lot like walking to those who saw me struggle down the road during the first few months. However, the thing that helped me get on track was having a plan and sticking to it.CommentsGina LaGuardia-SchreckerWriter, editor, motherYou will wish with all you have -- all that you are -- that your loved one came home that Monday night, not that you are left with a piece of your heart now missing, splintered with shards of sadness.CommentsJames AltucherAuthor and EntrepreneurHonesty is about the scars. It\u0027s about the blemishes. But it\u0027s more than just bragging about failure, which could be a form of ego. It\u0027s about truly helping people.CommentsKathy CalvinPresident and CEO, the United Nations FoundationMany women across the globe face extraordinary barriers as they seek better futures and fortunes. Generally, women have a harder time accessing credit and capital. They carry a heavier burden of household responsibilities and are more likely to work in the informal economy and at insecure jobs.CommentsSimon RosenbergPresident, NDNFor those Republicans worried about getting their party right with the new American electorate, I would be more than a bit concerned about the current attack on the Affordable Care Act. No group will benefit more from the ACA than Hispanic Americans.Comments (40)Arianna HuffingtonAs the UN General Assembly begins a new session and leaders from all over the world come together to tackle our biggest problems, we\u0027re starting conversations at HuffPost on a handful of big initiatives that focus on ways to improve people\u0027s lives in the developing world.Comments (20)Alice WilderFreshman at UNC-Chapel HillI know times are tough for you right now. Your approval numbers are in free fall and your own party is overriding your vetoes. So I thought now would be a good time for a young North Carolinian to reach out and say a sincere \"thanks.\"Comments (68)Bob ComisWriter, farmerThe question of livestock raising is one that transcends the hubris of production efficiency for humility, compassion, and empathy, which enable us to acknowledge and grant the animals\u0027 expression and pursuit of their own interests.CommentsAdam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; founder of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911If a prospective employer is looking at your credit report, how do you deal with it? What if they see something bad? What to do? First, don\u0027t panic. Next, consider these tips.Comments (27)Ellen DolgenAuthor, \u0027Shmirshky: The Pursuit of Hormone Happiness\u0027Truth be told, I spent about half of my 59th year planning the party for my big six-zero. For six months, I racked my brain on exactly how I wanted to celebrate the big day and year.Comments (22)Munmun KhanStudent, University of MichiganDoesn\u0027t Nina also represent \"what is best of America\"?
