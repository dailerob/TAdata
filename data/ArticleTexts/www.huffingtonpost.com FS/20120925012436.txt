{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Here\u0027s a thought exercise: what will the day be like when we finally defeat AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria? Will developing countries, long burdened by these diseases, finally be able to enjoy the fruits of growth and prosperity? In fact, with the launch today of The Big Push campaign -- co-sponsored by The Global Fund and The Huffington Post -- this might be more than a thought exercise. That\u0027s because the progress that\u0027s been made against these diseases in only the last 10 years has been so staggering that we may actually be in sight of the day when no child is born with HIV, nobody dies of malaria and we stop the spread of tuberculosis. But though great progress has been made, we can\u0027t let up now -- not when the end is in sight. So The Big Push campaign is our chance to get the attention of decision-makers and make sure they seize this opportunity to make history in global health.Read Post | Comments (36)Howard Fineman, 09/24/12Editorial Director, Huffington Post Media GroupIf American democracy is to work -- if we are to prevent the blood from clotting in the body politic -- presidential elections must be real contests over real ideas and real records, informed by real facts.
