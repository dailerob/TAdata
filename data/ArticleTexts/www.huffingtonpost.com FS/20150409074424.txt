{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersThe critics who want a more perfect deal must answer President Obama\u0027s challenge to \"provide a reasonable alternative.\" With the leading nations of the world and the UN part of this deal, tougher multilateral sanctions will not be possible. And military action could not end Iran\u0027s nuclear program for more than a few years. On the contrary, war with Iran would most likely accelerate it -- ultimately leading to another American war with a Muslim country rallying an increasingly pro-American and young Iranian population around their ayatollahs. Many of us will not send our sons and daughters to another disastrous American war.This is what ex-members of Congress and their staffs do nowadays. Rarely do they follow the example of ancient Rome\u0027s Cincinnatus and go back to the farm -- or take that teaching job at the local university or join a hometown law practice. They stay in DC to reap the bountiful harvest that comes from Capitol Hill experience and good old fashioned cronyism.Senior writer, Moyers \u0026 Company on public TV. Senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.What are the chances that Sen. Rand Paul will get elected President next year? Look at it this way: Sen. Paul\u0027s is running for re-election to the Senate at the same time he is running for President. That doesn\u0027t show a lot of confidence in his presidential prospects.Professor, George Mason University; contributor, Al JazeeraIt\u0027s bad enough big money is buying off politicians. It\u0027s also buying off nonprofits that used to be sources of investigation, information, and social change, from criticizing big money.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The Bad Newz Kennels bust captured the attention of dog lovers all across the country. Eight years later, these 48 dogs have proven, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that fighting was something that was forced on them -- not something they were born to do. Once they had the opportunity to become companions, they took it and ran with it.Manager, Best Friends Animal Society\u0027s Parrot Garden; Adopter of two former fighting dogsIf we want to realize social media\u0027s full promise of massive unprecedented global conversation conducted in real time, we should be teaching our students how to argue both thoughtfully and effectively.President, Foundation for Individual Rights in EducationAn increasing number of legal experts around the world have come to believe that the lack of government action to prevent dangerous climate change represents a gross violation of the rights of those who will suffer the consequences. These arguments are at the core of the Dutch lawsuit and will undoubtedly be put to the test in other countries before too long.Campaign ConsultantDespite the power of incumbency and the backing of the President, Rahm Emanuel nevertheless became the first mayor in Chicago history to be forced into a runoff. Emanuel\u0027s struggle to retain his office is a warning for politicians everywhere: Corporate Democrats are likely to find themselves on the defensive in 2016 and beyond.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourRepublican White House hopefuls have received better, more sympathetic press coverage than Hillary Clinton, whose page-one coverage to date has been almost devoid of positive Times treatments.Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaLast year, I challenged the Koch brothers to meet me for a debate so that we could have an open, transparent exchange of ideas. Unfortunately, they refused, so I\u0027m about to give them another chance. I am formally inviting the Kochs -- again -- to participate in a public debate.California Philanthropist \u0026 Climate ChampionWhile Boston is rapidly becoming a hub of opportunity for some, the breadth of this financial instability exposes an inequality of opportunity that hurts both families and Boston\u0027s long-term economic prospects. If we want to begin to address inequality, we must ensure that families have the tools necessary to become economically resilient.Global Director, Citi Community Development and Inclusive Finance54th Mayor of BostonThe one thing that Paul banks on to separate him from the expected large pack of GOP senators is his big pitch to make the GOP more minority-friendly. The hardest part of the sell will be getting minorities to think that they can somehow share the same space in the GOP with the legions of Tea Party adherents.Author and political analystWomen tend to \"view sex as something that they are doing for someone else.\" If we are able to shift our mindset to view sex (or physical intimacy) as something pleasurable we are doing for ourselves, this can shift the power dynamic for couples.Teacher, blogger, lover of courage in all forms (and Spanish wine). Author of eBook: Start Investing in Your Emotional Wellbeing @ www.secondhandtherapy.comWe can stop showering, stop watering our lawns, and stop ordering water in restaurants, but the water used to raise and slaughter millions of cows, pigs, and chickens in California will still drain the state dry.Executive director, Animal Legal Defense FundAs a country, when we set up huge barriers to employment for people with criminal records ... we are doing ourselves a disservice... The disservice is to the people who have paid their debt to society but who are never forgiven, and it is also to ourselves, to those of us on the outside who actually are making our society less safe by almost ensuring that people who come out of prison will have to turn back to crime in order to make any money. We must start to create opportunities for people with records who want to and are ready to work.Founder and CEO, Isidore Electronics RecyclingThe practice of MEP and the U.S. government to deem even the most sympathetic and reasonable circumstances \"job abandonment\" and to deny Afghans special immigrant visas -- their only opportunity for safety in America -- on this basis is bad policy and bad judgment.Supervising attorney with the Iraqi Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP)Co-founder of the Iraqi Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP) chapter at The George Washington University Law SchoolStarting April 8, 2015, employers who do business with the federal government may not discriminate against applicants and employees on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.Clinical Professor of Law; Director, Work-Life Law and Policy Clinic, ASU Sandra Day O\u0027Connor College of LawOngoing exclusion of and discrimination against people of African descent throughout their life course, along with the legacy of bad past policies, continue to shape patterns of disease distribution and mortality.The world\u0027s leading medical journalLiving a life fueled by fear is not healthy or sustainable. At some point, something has to give and often the first thing to be affected is our physical well-being. There simply has to be more to a life well lived than years of anxiety followed by illness and an inability to enjoy any of the trimmings that our burn out has paid for.Freelance writer and bloggerIt is hard enough to be a teenager trying to figure out what you want to be when you grow up. Adding on a chronic illness makes that 10 times harder.Chronic Illness Advocate/Blogger Chronicallyawesome23.blogspot.comIf the TPP is really a good deal for the US, and since I haven\u0027t read it I can\u0027t say, then based on the first bullet above, I understand, conditional on greater effort than I believe has been expended thus far, that a currency chapter could kill the deal.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThere are many ways to stall out and lose motivation along the way, but certain strategies can actually help keep you on track. From sleep to smart goal setting, here are five habits to help support your fitness goals and make you more successful.Entrepreneur, CEO at One Mall GroupI couldn\u0027t stop feeling like Black Girls Rock! was doing more than entertaining us. It was bonding us. Halfway into the show, Michelle Obama walked onto the stage and for some reason, I had a visceral reaction.

He struggled, yet ironically, he often acted in ways that maintained -- rather than alleviated -- his misery. Apparently he\u0027s not alone in this sad choice.Author, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027The contradiction between the Venezuela sanctions and the opening to Cuba is probably more apparent than real.

It prohibits federal contractors and subcontractors from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.U.S. Secretary of LaborUntil this failure is addressed, family members of elderly patients with dementia must take proactive steps to protect their loved ones from being exposed to antipsychotic drugs.Director of Public Citizen\u0027s Health Research Group.For far too long, the Republican leadership in Congress has refused to act and pass comprehensive reform fixing our broken immigration system. In light of Republican inaction, I strongly support President Obama\u0027s executive actions on immigration.U.S. Representative for Illinois\u0027s 9th congressional districtDiscrimination laws protect Christians far more than gays in this country.
