{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Children\u0027s Defense FundCongress\u0027 annual struggle to avoid cuts in Medicare reimbursement rates so physicians will continue to give seniors the care they need is widely considered must-pass bipartisan legislation. Known as the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) or \"doc fix,\" this annual process often provides a vehicle for moving other legislative health priorities. This year\u0027s proposed \"doc fix\" is great news for seniors whom we support, but why is Congress leaving children behind by extending funding for the successful bipartisan Children\u0027s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and the Maternal and Infant Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) program for only two years? Congress must stop playing politics with children. We need to ensure our children are healthy, supported, and strong if they are going to be able to support our growing number of seniors in the future.American foreign policy is controlled by fools. What else can one conclude from the bipartisan demand that the U.S. intervene everywhere all the time, irrespective of consequences? No matter how disastrous the outcome, the War Lobby insists that the idea was sound.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteA mass abduction that was seen a year ago as unprecedented -- sparking justifiable outrage across the world -- now seems, after a series of further kidnaps, to look like a sadly increasingly familiar tactic in the terrorist arsenal.Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationYou know that irresistible urge to compliment someone who lost weight? Well, before doing so, know this: Your comments are welcome, but please, for the sanity of all former overweight folks, don\u0027t dip your toe in tactless waters.Writer, photographer and weight loss success story who prefers to see the glass half full.There can be no real peace with honor if women are left out. Without women at the table, women\u0027s rights will be an empty promise if peace is ever negotiated.Money Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsWhen you are struggling with depression, it is so tempting to think that this is the way it will always be. But life takes different twists and turns, and we don\u0027t get to know what the next chapter in our life will bring if we give up on ourselves.Marriage and Family TherapistThe tragic discovery of a missing African-American man\u0027s body hanging from a tree in rural Claiborne County, Mississippi is now being investigated by both state and federal authorities.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityWhile Obama has slowly stepped up transferring detainees already cleared by a multi-agency process for release from Guantanamo to other countries, his administration has dragged its feet on reviewing the 51 detainees who aren\u0027t yet cleared, out of the remaining 122.Senior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstIn seeking to perpetuate an indiscriminate \"war of choice\" on Obama\u0027s attorney general, whomever he or she might be, the GOP is repeating a grave mistake -- and poisoning what might otherwise be a cordial, or even productive, working relationship.Writer; former chief speechwriter to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder; veteran of Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.We are angry. A lot of people are angry. But the anger is a symptom. A symptom of something larger. A symptom of an education system for which no one feels accountable, a symptom of a society that is mostly indifferent to the children we serve.Veteran high school teacher and basketball coach; author, \u0027Students First and Other Lies\u0027How often do I have to raise my voice to be taken seriously? How acutely attuned are we to the way a man looks at the hem of our dress or the cut of our neckline?Senior Editor, HuffPost LAThe media treated longstanding questions about Schock\u0027s sexual orientation and how it relates to his anti-gay voting record differently from questions about his official spending and how it relates to his fiscally conservative positions, holding these kinds of alleged hypocrisy to different standards.Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesFunding for school policing programs has expanded and more school-based police are being armed with the same weapons cops carry on the streets. This expansion has not come with significant strings attached or proper guidelines.Senior Policy Advocate, ACLU of PennsylvaniaI was running errands with my youngest two children in tow when an acquaintance of ours spotted us and came over to say hello. She looked at my son, marveling over how much he had grown. \"Yes,\" I smiled, \"He\u0027s a big boy!\" She replied, \"Such a cute little thug.\" My son is 2 years old.Book author, mom by adoption, blogger, tea drinker, Christian, former college writing teacher, wife of SupermanBinyamin Netanyahu is probably the most deficient prime minister in Israel\u0027s history. His blunders and vices have been laid bare in great abundance during his nine years in power.Former Israeli Foreign MinisterIf you find yourself stuck on a plateau or not losing weight like you want to, put a little spring in your step and avoid these six things that can sabotage your weight loss! You can successfully push past a plateau and lose weight this spring!National fitness expert, speaker, contributor to Prevention magazine, author of several books and fitness DVDsLegislators supportive of a negotiated solution to the Iran nuclear crisis should recognize the Corker bill for what it is: a dangerously written measure that injects new demands into the negotiations and risks laying the foundation to kill a historic agreement. There are three major tripwires that the bill would impose on a deal.Policy Fellow, National Iranian American CouncilVoters are likely to remain dubious about candidates who offer only vague platitudes about key issues like jobs, wages, and trade without making firm commitments or offering specific proposals. The Maryland race has just begun, of course. But so far, it seems to point to the pitfalls of corporate \"centrism\" -- and the promise of economic populism.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourOur film Lost in the Fine Print shows what happens when consumers and employees are prevented from standing up for their rights in court and instead forced to go before an arbitrator hired by the very company that wronged them. Much of the time, forced arbitration clauses mean those disputes never go anywhere at all. Now there is a new mass of additional evidence.President, Alliance for JusticeNYU might in the past have been able to claim that the UAE\u0027s crackdown on freedom of expression was of no concern to them but the denial of entry to one of their own professors and his classification as a security risk skewers that argument.Middle East researcher, Human Rights WatchImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has a new director, Sarah Saldaña, but she made it apparent on Thursday that the agency is stuck making the same old mistakes. And the timing couldn\u0027t be worse.Policy Director and Senior Staff Attorney, Advancing Justice - Asian Law CaucusWhile I absolutely believe that AA is far from perfect, please trust me when I suggest that we would not want to wake up tomorrow in a world without it.Yoga teacher and addiction recovery expertThe n-word has the blood of thousands of lynchings, beatings, and other horrific crimes melded between its letters, meshed in its very fibers. So, why do some white people want the right to use this abhorrent word again?Author of \u0027The Sacred Bombshell Handbook of Self-Love\u0027 and \u0027Dare\u0027, Speaker, Transformational Coach, Award-Winning BloggerIn his latest op-ed, Sen. Mitch McConnell repeated the same baseless claims he has been making for some time. He\u0027s still wrong on all counts.Senior Writer, Union of Concerned ScientistsObamacare was supposed to make birth control free for all women. But that reality is still far off.Editor, HuffPost BusinessI\u0027m frequently asked the loaded question of how much I am madly in love with Walter. I mostly give the questioner what they want with a nod of assent. But the truth of my emotion is more complicated. I think maybe the problem is with how I have, up to this point, understood the word \"love.\"Executive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostWhat is oddest about opposition to action to address climate change is the implications for another priority of the Republican party: deficit reduction. The bury-your-head-in-the-sand approach won\u0027t make extreme weather events driven by a changing climate go away, but it will ensure that our response is uncoordinated, less proactive, and far more expensive.U.S. Representative for New York\u0027s 12th District; Ranking Democrat, Joint Economic CommitteeIn this new American production of the Japanese classic, 47 Republican senators play the roles of the 47 ronin. They too deliberately defy the shogun, played with equanimity by President Obama. But the American ronin are out to kill a policy, not a person.Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogNot only do these sessions help get the puppies socialized -- used to new people, smells and sounds -- but observations about how the puppies behave help determine whether or not they\u0027re on the guide-dog track.Animal Welfare Editor, The Huffington PostWhen we start practicing this with simple things -- everyday things that aren\u0027t emotionally charged -- we make it easier to do when we need help with big things, or when we need to be vulnerable about big things. Asking other people for help isn\u0027t being a burden; it\u0027s part of making the world a better place.Owner and founder, Be You Media GroupStop kidding yourself.
