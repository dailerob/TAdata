{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and editor-in-chief of The Huffington PostIt\u0027s mission accomplished for financial reform. Unfortunately, it\u0027s more of a Bush 43 \"mission accomplished\" than an Apollo 13 \"mission accomplished.\" That\u0027s because the financial reform bill passed by the Senate last week, like Bush\u0027s ship deck ceremony, is more notable for what it has left undone. There\u0027s a reason a longtime investment banker said of his colleagues\u0027 reaction to the new bill, \"If you talk to anyone privately, there\u0027s a sigh of relief.\" Don\u0027t expect a similar reaction on Main Street.
