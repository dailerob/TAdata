{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Janet TavakoliPresident, Tavakoli Structured FinanceBloomberg News\u0027 Yalman Onaran wrote an article on Monday about the disaster that would unfold if we don\u0027t raise the debt ceiling and the U.S. has a technical default by missing an interest payment on U.S. Treasuries. James Kochan\u0027s quote summed up my feelings: \"Well, holy cripes!\" It has never happened in modern history and would be a disaster greater than the September 2008 financial crisis. China and Japan combined own $2.4 trillion in U.S. Treasuries, and they are understandably upset with the U.S. about the possibility of a technical default. Most of the financial press has focused on how awful a technical default would be, and who is upset. But our leaders might ask a different question. Who are the reprobates that are cheering for the possibility of a technical default on the U.S.? Who stands to gain? Who might be happy to set off this financial bomb?Comments (233)Niall FergusonLaurence A. Tisch Professor of History at Harvard University; Senior Fellow of the Hoover Institution, Stanford UniversityWhy, you may ask, did Krugman feel the need to be so bold (and so wrong) in predicting the euro\u0027s collapse over and over again, in his column, on his blog and to every media outlet that would give him an interview?Comments (354)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027If we get to October 17 and the Republicans are still holding the nation hostage, the president has only one option.Comments (1,109)George LogothetisAt the core of human motivation is the idea that tomorrow can be better than today.

I miss everything about her sweet, beautiful face smiling up at me. There are days when my face, I am sure, looks a lot like Emilie\u0027s did the day we let her butterflies go.Comments (147)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureTea Party Republicans may want to take heed. They\u0027ve been endangering the economy for lawful and unlawful enterprises alike, and some people are becoming unhappy. Now the GOP appears to be facing a showdown between ideological purity and the self-interest of the powerful.CommentsDan GolemanAuthor, \u0027Focus: The Hidden Driver of Excellence\u0027The more focused we are, the more successful we can be at whatever we do. And, conversely, the more distracted, the less well we do. This applies across the board: sports, school, career.CommentsJon HotchkissCreator, ThisvsThatShow.comThe minute anyone says the government shutdown is the fault of the Democrats in Congress and President Obama, please show them this video.Comments (92)Jenny Dewey RohrichPhotographer, blogger, country girlThere is no denying the fact that our relationship is an adventure.

Get under some weights and lift. anything you read in any women\u0027s fitness magazine is suspect. Actually, it\u0027s not just suspect -- you can be guaranteed that they\u0027re feeding you inaccurate trash.CommentsRep. Jan SchakowskyU.S. Representative for Illinois\u0027s 9th congressional districtI was arrested for \"blocking passage\" of a little used street along with seven other members of Congress and 200 others who want House Republican leadership to stop delaying a vote on comprehensive immigration legislation.Comments (17)Ann BrenoffSenior Writer, The Huffington PostWe all know that money can\u0027t buy us happiness, right? Even accepting that idea as gospel, there are some things that we are mighty happy we spent our money on. Here are seven that come to mind.Comments (110)Hannah BrencherWriter, Millennial Communications Expert, Founder of MoreLoveLetters.comLife is a steep, uphill battle but it\u0027s fierce and it\u0027s beautiful and you\u0027ll be sad to see it go if you live it right.Comments (122)Joseph BobrowFounder and president, Coming Home ProjectIn the case of a recent DoD decision regarding the mental health of our service members, evem Churchill\u0027s old line about Americans understates our capacity for doing the wrong thing over and over again.CommentsCynthia JeubBloggerI\u0027m bothered by three other elements of the billboard campaign. First, it points to Genesis 1:1 to make its point, which means the argument is between young-earth creationism and evolution. Second, it says \"thank God\" on it. Third, it calls atheists \"our friends,\" and proceeds not to treat them in a friendly way.Comments (340)Anna Leahy and Douglas DechowIt\u0027s Nobel Prize season! The three big science categories -- physiology or medicine, physics, and chemistry--were just announced on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Of the eight science winners, how many are women? Zero!CommentsPaul PolmanCEO, UnileverWhen people talk about new forms of capitalism, this is what I have in mind: companies that show, in all transparency, that they are contributing to society, now and for many generations to come. Not taking from it.Comments (72)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorI\u0027ve found her analysis of the problems in the recent and current economy uniquely clear and persuasive. It\u0027s not over \u0027til it\u0027s over, and it hasn\u0027t started yet, but I suspect she\u0027ll be approved by the Senate.CommentsMichael V. Kaplen and Shana De CaroGoddell\u0027s disingenuous portrayal of the league\u0027s concern about the health and safety of the players is incredible at best. His assertion that the league has been forthcoming with medical information as it has become available, defies credulity.CommentsRep. Judy ChuU.S. Representative for California\u0027s 27th DistrictWhile the Senate addressed immigration\u0027s complexities in a comprehensive package, House Republican leaders cherry picked the few reforms they were willing to address. This is no way to solve one of the greatest challenges of our time. The American people have waited long enough -- it\u0027s time for the House to act.CommentsSean McElweeWriterWith the possibility of the government defaulting on its debt looming, it\u0027s worth critically examining some of the more popular far-right talking points.Comments (33)Keith ThomsonWriterAs an unwanted fourteenth child on a remote North Dakota farm, Lawrence L.

Actually, it goes beyond that.Comments (99)Spencer OvertonProfessor of Law at The George Washington University Law School; Senior Fellow at DemosI attended today\u0027s U.S. Supreme Court oral argument in the case challenging contribution limits. If the Justices rewrite campaign finance law by striking down the contribution limits, checks of up to $2.95 million each from wealthy contributors will corrupt democracy.Comments (227)Clayton B. CornellSpartanTraveler.comLong-term traveling can teach you more than almost anything else. About yourself, about life, about what you need to be happy. It\u0027s too easy to get complacent at home and if you aren\u0027t at least a little uncomfortable, you probably aren\u0027t learning anything.CommentsCharlie KimFounder and CEO, Next JumpMy mom is a pastor of a church. We had a discussion once: why do I need to send church tithes, 10 percent of my monthly pay...monthly. How about if I write one check at the end of the year. Her response was as simple and wise as our mothers\u0027 can be: \"Because you won\u0027t.\"CommentsJoshua A. DouglasAssistant Professor of Law, University of Kentucky College of LawCongress, in its considered judgment, imposed an aggregate limit on campaign contributions in an effort to root out corruption. The question of whether the Court should defer to this legislative judgment did not receive much play at the Supreme Court today.Comments (32)Root CapitalSahel\u0027s native trees -- like Dr. Seuss\u0027 fantastical, colorful truffula trees in his tale The Lorax -- are far more than they appear.CommentsTrita ParsiPresident, National Iranian American CouncilAre these countries destined to be enemies?
