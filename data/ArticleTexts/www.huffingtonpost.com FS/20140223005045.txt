{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe headlines in the case were sadly familiar. An angry adult armed with a gun used it to shoot and kill an unarmed black teenager he thought seemed “bad” -- this time, because the teenager and his friends were sitting in a car listening to music the grownup didn’t like. In this outrageous Florida case, a middle-aged white man, Michael Dunn, was convicted of three counts of attempted murder and one count of shooting a gun into an occupied car. Jurors agreed he faced no threat after he was annoyed by loud music -- coming from a car he had deliberately chosen to park next to -- and then started an argument, pulled a gun on the car’s black teens, and fired three shots at the young men inside the car as they tried to drive away from him.Comments (369)Chelsea HandlerComedian, Host, ‘Chelsea Lately’This isn\u0027t about Bill Carter. This is about being noted as a parenthetical, reaffirming what I feel has been an underlying, yet consistent inconsistency with how I am handled as the only woman in a traditionally male field.Comments (140)Jason St. AngeloBlog Editor, Huffington Post; Former Assistant Editor, HuffPost SportsImmediately after the clock ran down in the third period cementing Finland\u0027s bronze-medal victory over the U.S., Teemu Selanne found himself in familiar territory. The Finnish Flash was back on the world\u0027s largest stage.CommentsMark RuffaloActor/DirectorWhen I tell you that one in five people around the world lacks access to safe drinking water, you\u0027re likely to find that unfortunate, but you\u0027re not likely to assume that this statistic affects you. So, perhaps I should start over.Comments (47)TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"It\u0027s amazing what a rigged game of Monopoly can reveal. Psychologist Paul Piff shares research showing that people who feel wealthy tend to behave badly. Why is that? And what does it mean for America?Comments (82)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, Beyond OutrageThe winners here are truly big winners. WhatsApp\u0027s fifty-five employees are now enormously rich. Its two founders are now billionaires. And the partners of the venture capital firm that financed it have also reaped a fortune. And the rest of us?Comments (430)James ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027The story is clearly not over. Having weathered the harsh winter, the young demonstrators in Maidan do not trust their government and are not ready to go home until they see results. The government has changed its position so many times in the past, they may do so again.CommentsClaire FallonBooks Editor, The Huffington PostThe plethora of ways ironic can be used meaningfully suggests that it’s something of a catchall for a situation that seems odd, upsetting or amusing, but in fact, each kind of irony has a specific definition that carries a precise meaning.Comments (33)Carl PopeFormer executive director and chairman, Sierra ClubApart from the outcome, the VW organizing drive revealed precisely how hollow conservative objections to government taking sides are -- it\u0027s all about what side government takes.Comments (19)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarMost of us focus on the external -- what our bosses and co-workers do and say. But relationships can benefit if we spend a little time on what is behind behavior -- the human wiring that makes up each of us.CommentsKerry Max CookFormer inmate on death row in Texas; author and activistMy name is Kerry Max Cook, but for two decades, I was known as \"Cook, Execution number 600.\"Comments (13)Philip SeibProfessor, University of Southern CaliforniaDevelopment of Arab media education has been slowed by ill-conceived efforts to mirror Western -- especially American -- curricula. This problem is rooted in a failure to recognize that the heart of a media curriculum is not technique but culture.CommentsPhilip K. HowardAuthor, \u0027The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America\u0027The direct costs of sue-for-anything justice are only the tiny tip of a far larger cost--a pervasive fear of litigation has replaced a sense of freedom and spontaneity in social dealings. A tidal wave of defensiveness has washed over American culture.Comments (13)Eric BoehlertSenior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaIncreasingly reliant on bad fringe actors like Nugent to connect with their far, far-right audience, the conservative media have built up Obama-bashing personalities who no longer occupy any corner of the American mainstream. Yet Nugent enjoys deep ties with Republican campaigns all across the country. When those ties receive media scrutiny, they cannot be defended.Comments (247)Mary Darling Montero, LCSWMary Darling Montero is a psychotherapist trained in EMDR for trauma resolution, a writer, and a cancer survivor.I am standing in front of my bathroom mirror, about to look at the surgery site for the first time. I take off the surgical bra and see two large, rectangular bandages. I pinch their corners and breathe in, then out. I pull them off.CommentsMargaret ManningAuthor, Speaker, and Founder of Sixtyandme.comWhy is a 60-year-old woman going to see \u0027Frozen\u0027, an animated children\u0027s Disney movie, for the third time? The answer is that this film quite honestly changed my life.CommentsChris WeigantPolitical writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comWe have a running theme this week: the utter and complete failure of the Republican Party\u0027s vaunted \"outreach\" to certain groups of Americans who have been voting against them in droves.CommentsJoanna ZelmanFront page editor, The Huffington PostMy passport is like the blood-sucking, voracious plant from Little Shop Of Horrors -- the more I feed it, the hungrier it gets.CommentsAllen FrancesProfessor Emeritus, Duke UniversityThe basic pitch is \u0027do nothing\u0027 until we can prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that we are irrevocably ruining our environment. Of course, this is brutal and ruthless cynicism -- by then it will be too late to save ourselves and prevent the environmental catastrophes, famine, war, and pestilence that will inevitably follow.Comments (52)Myroslav MarynovychVice-rector of the Ukrainian Catholic University, founder of Amnesty International Ukraine, and fmr. prisoner of conscienceFirst of all, stop \"expressing deep concern.\" All the protesters on Maidan have developed an allergy to that expression, which, under our circumstances, has lost all meaning, while the gangsters in the Ukrainian government are laughing at the helplessness of the EU.CommentsDonna Rockwell, PsyDLicensed clinical psychologist, specialist in celebrity mental health, leading mindfulness meditation teacher, and activist in contemporary humanistic psychologyI listened carefully as he spoke. I took notes. I mulled over in detail his main points. Since that day, I have steeped, like tea, in the essence of his message. My sense is that if he were to write a \"Dear Dalai Lama\" column, this is what he might say.CommentsBustleNews, entertainment, lifestyle sitePerhaps the reason bi celebrities may be reluctant to come out is that they fear it would hurt their careers in a way that being gay no longer does. Perhaps they fear their fans will wonder whether they are confused, promiscuous, or indecisive. That\u0027s what people wonder about non-celebrities, after all.CommentsTess MunsterPlus size model, make up artist, blogger, activistWe are constantly told that the true key to happiness is limited to the size you wear. Frankly, that\u0027s the real problem here. What we need is more people saying it\u0027s okay to be your size, to love your body, regardless.Comments (128)Erin SchumakerBlog Editor, The Huffington PostAlthough Upstate New York often takes a backseat to the glitz and glam of the city, the state\u0027s northern frontier has called to urbanites since the days of Emerson and Thoreau. As it turns out, the early Romantics were onto something: When it comes to living well, upstaters may be able to teach us a thing or two.Comments (20)Sarah FaderParenting bloggerWhen I was a little girl, I believed the way to get others to like me was to be nice. I shouldn\u0027t be confrontational. It would be wrong to express anger, because that would make me look \"crazy\" or \"wild.\" The brainwashing from society starts young.Comments (64)Francesca GinoProfessor of Business Administration, Harvard Business SchoolSelf-reflection may be a simple exercise, but it is an important one: it reminds us of our YES--that we want to be good people. By recognizing the pervasive effects money can have, we can be more mindful of our actions and make time to think about time.CommentsDan GlickmanSenior Fellow at the Bipartisan Policy CenterI am particularly proud of the history of Kansas as a progressive leader against discrimination. Fast forward to 2014 and the Kansas House of Representatives turns away from our proud heritage. The Kansas House passed a law that clearly and forcefully discriminates, in both the private and public sector, against same-sex couples.Comments (21)David Katz, M.D.Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterA new study of mammography, showing lack of survival benefit, has once again muddied these waters and muddled the relevant messaging.Comments (36)Terry O\u0027NeillPresident, National Organization for WomenThe White House has confirmed that President Obama won\u0027t include the \"chained CPI\" (a formula for reducing cost-of-living adjustments in Social Security benefits) in his 2015 budget. It\u0027s clear that it was a political calculus that prompted this step today -- but we have to be vigilant and prepared for a renewed battle over the chained CPI in the near future.CommentsAlex KimCommunications marketer, 500pxThe insane YouTube video of Vadim Makhorov and Vitaly Raskalov swept across the interwebs this week, inducing vertigo everywhere.Comments (19)Kristen Race, Ph.D.Author, Mindful Parenting and founder, Mindful LifeWe can\u0027t help our kids manage their stress until we can manage ours. If you think you\u0027re hiding your worry and stress from your kids, keeping them in a safe bubble of blissful childhood, think again.CommentsDoug Thornell, 2014.22.02Otto Scharmer, 2014.22.02Jason St. Angelo, 2014.22.02Regina Weinreich, 2014.22.02Sean McElwee, 2014.22.02George Heymont, 2014.22.02Cailin Loesch, 2014.22.02Tara Subramaniam, 2014.22.02Erik Brattberg, 2014.22.02Danny Schechter, 2014.22.02Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"\u0027A DICTATORSHIP HAS ENDED\u0027",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
