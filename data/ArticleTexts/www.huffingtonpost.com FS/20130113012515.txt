{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe heartrending massacre of 20 6- and 7-year-old children and six educators in Newtown, Conn., has galvanized public attention once again after a mass shooting. But the killing of children by gun violence is not new. In 2013, as we prepare to celebrate Martin Luther King\u0027s birthday and the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington and the dream of our gun-slain prophet of nonviolence, let us truly hear and follow rather than just celebrate him. Now is the time to free ourselves from the plague of gun violence which has taken over 1.3 million American lives since Dr. King and Robert Kennedy\u0027s assassinations in 1968. This is twice the loss of life than all American battle casualties in all the major wars we have fought since our nation began.Read Post | Comments (920)Amy Cuddy, 01/11/13Professor, Harvard Business SchoolIt\u0027s not uncommon for people to overvalue the importance of demonstrating their competence and power, often at the expense of demonstrating their warmth. People judge trustworthiness before competence.Read Post | Comments (150)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 01/12/13Author, research psychologist and gender scholarEven as our acceptance of less rigid gender roles grows in other areas, the pressure on boys to be \"toned and muscular\" represents a return to a traditional notion of masculinity and what it means to be a man. The message: It\u0027s fine if boys want to go around wearing sparkly nail polish as kids, as long as they grow up to be big and strong and macho.Read Post | Comments (81)Tracy Schorn, 01/12/13Blogger at Chump Lady, Journalist, CartoonistI don\u0027t fault betrayed people for wanting revenge. Revenge is primal. It is the quest for vigilante justice -- a desire to make that oppressive jerk choke on some of the humiliation for once.Read Post | Comments (138)Joan Price, 01/12/13Senior Sex ExpertBy hiding your body and being embarrassed by it, you\u0027re buying into our youth-obsessed culture that says that only young, firm, fertile bodies can be sexy and alluring. Let\u0027s put that notion to rest right now!Read Post | Comments (104)Bob Cesca, 01/11/13Political Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowIt\u0027s becoming clear to me that Tarantino made something far deeper than a spaghetti western. I\u0027ve come to realize that his chosen homage/genre was simply a launching point into a much more substantive story about an unlikely friendship, joined in a quest for an unlikely love story.Read Post | Comments (335)Ben Thomas, 01/11/13Founder, The ConnectomeYour brain\u0027s recognition system is neither simple nor always predictable.

Swanee Hunt, 01/12/13Lecturer in public policy at Harvard, former ambassador to AustriaWomen may be our best chance at breaking through disastrous partisan gridlock.

Braunstein, M.D., 01/11/13Vice President of Clinical Innovation, at Cedars-SinaiThis time of colds, ear and sinus infections and influenza can provide a reason for each of us, as individuals, to look at our own health and healthcare and see how our small choices play a role in contributing to the burgeoning, unsustainable costs of U.S. medicine.Read Post | CommentsMichael Strahan, 01/12/13NFL Superbowl Champion and On-Air Commentator \u0026 HostMany of you know me as Michael Strahan the NFL football player and as Kelly\u0027s sidekick on LIVE! with Kelly and Michael.

It is the entire neo-conservative enterprise that led the U.S. into two failed wars in Afghanistan and Iraq (which they cannot admit were failures) and has them still advocating for more aggressive military engagements in Syria and Iran.Read Post | Comments (43)Jaweed Kaleem, 01/11/13Reporter, The Huffington PostThe Rev.
