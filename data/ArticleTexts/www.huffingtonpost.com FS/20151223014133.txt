{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoIn recent weeks, two of the legal scholars I most admire -- Cass Sunstein and Eric Posner -- have independently called for possible limitations on the scope of First Amendment protection in light of the dangers posed to the United States by online radicalization messages directed at Americans. Although I certainly understand the concerns driving these suggestions, it is essential that we resist the temptation to restrict our most fundamental freedoms in moment of panic. This is not to say that our nation\u0027s security is not important or that preventing terrorist attacks is not a critical goal. But it is to say that this is not an appropriate way to protect ourselves.The simple truth about Ted Cruz, says Eliana Johnson of the National Review, is that \"the man who boasts of his ideological purity is perhaps the most obviously tactical candidate.\"Novelist and contributing opinion writerI have learned over the years though that \u0027nice\u0027 is good, but \u0027too nice\u0027 is not. \u0027Too nice\u0027 is the person who doesn\u0027t like to ruffle feathers. \u0027Too nice\u0027 is the person who is afraid to set boundaries. \u0027Too nice\u0027 is the person who is afraid to say no. \u0027Too nice\u0027 is the person who I used to be (and still am, sometimes).Writer, blogger, educator (\u0026 mom)Even the ideas you consider worthy and apolitical have to struggle to rise above the noise level. I hope that many who read these lines and think about the many Syrian children who will spend this season in schools that are bombed, scavenging for food, will not only sign the petition but also ask others to join us in advancing a good cause.Professor of international relations, George Washington UniversityMartin Shkreli, the former hedge-fund manager turned pharmaceutical CEO who was arrested last week, has been described as a sociopath and worse. In reality, he\u0027s a brasher and larger version of what others in finance and corporate suites do all the time.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027Now millions of Black girls AND women will see this story in a whole new way and more importantly, they will see themselves in the smartest, kindest, most useful character in the entire Harry Potter series. Eventually, Black girls will start to see themselves as limitless. What could possibly be wrong with that?Blog Editor, The Huffington PostChildhood ends the first time you sit on Santa\u0027s lap and see those wire earpieces connecting his beard to his head.Novelist, \u0027Shepherd Avenue,\u0027 \u0027My Ride With Gus\u0027There are many social norms that dictate gift-giving, including when, how and what to give as gifts. Interestingly, these norms don\u0027t seem to be about making sure that recipients get the gifts they want. What makes for a good or bad gift often differs in the eyes of givers and recipients.Independent source of news and analysis, from the academic and research community.Reports of the death of print books were, it turns out, premature. Print book sales in the United States in 2015 are up more than 2 percent over last year, according to Nielsen BookScan.Journal of Books and IdeasFor years, the Transportation Department relied on big fines to deter violations of federal law by airlines. Under the current leadership, however, the emphasis seems to be shifting to advocacy for individuals.Author, How to Be the World\u0027s Smartest Traveler (and Save Time, Money, and Hassle)When it comes to the Federal Reserve Board and its importance to the economy, most of the candidates seem to be failing as badly as Donald Trump did on his nuclear triad test.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027I am a half Egyptian, half white-American Muslim woman who was raised in a standard, middle-class suburb in The Middle Of Nowhere, USA. My mother and older sister wear headscarfs for various deeply personal reasons, and I do not. In truth, I don\u0027t wear a headscarf for one reason.Student, american, egyptian, muslim, musician, writer?The very same litany of questions our kids never stop asking and that we struggle to answer, or wonder whether to answer at all, is always running like some strange song through our own adult heads as well, largely unanswered.Columnist, Waging Nonviolence; author of \"It Runs in the Family: On Being Raised by Radicals and Growing into Rebellious Motherhood\"More than a month after 69-year-old Korean farmer Nam-ki Baek was knocked to the ground by high-powered police water cannons at a Nov. 14 rally in Seoul, he remains unconscious and hospitalized.Writer and artistWalter, I pray that on this Christmas and every Christmas for as long as you shall live that you will remember and know how much your parents love you. May the birth of Jesus be a reminder that your life is precious.Former Executive Editor Of Global Spirituality and Religion, The Huffington PostNever did a person say that Nixon ruined every other white man\u0027s chance at presidency, because white people are defined by characteristics other than their race. When you look at President Obama, when you look at people like me, Mr. Trump, do you only see a black face?Columbia University freshmanThe big news today was that Senator Lindsey Graham has decided to drop out of the presidential nomination race. But recently, what has surprised me even more, is one Hillary Clinton quote in particular about the Middle East that hasn\u0027t gotten any media attention at all.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comOne thing is clear, the force is definitely woke.Freelance Culture WriterIf Hillary becomes the nominee, as seems likely, young women will come out and vote for her. If she can take steps to remind young women that feminism is far from over, and that she understands the world differently because she is a woman, they may be even more likely to support her.Assistant Professor, Political Science, Rutgers-Camden, specializing in race/gender, identity, and social movements in U.S. politics.I don\u0027t think grief ever goes away completely and honestly, I don\u0027t want it to. No matter how brief grief graces me with her presence, she always leaves my heart a little softer and puts thing in perspective on what\u0027s really important. Maybe it\u0027s my brother\u0027s way of sending us a Christmas gift to remind us that Christmas isn\u0027t a season. It\u0027s a feeling.Blogger, www.itsalushlife.comSo I don\u0027t know if this happens at your office, but it\u0027s happened at the last three jobs I\u0027ve worked at: You walk into a stall in the ladies\u0027 room, and the seat will be absolutely covered in pee. So much pee, it couldn\u0027t possibly be a mistake. The quantity of urine is almost aggressive in its plentitude.Writer at Pinterest (formerly Facebook), speaker, motherWriter of print and online features, essays, fiction and the film blog Hollywood CastawayThere\u0027s nothing quite like the holiday season to ratchet up the pressure we feel, not only to have it all together, but to wrap it in lights and tinsel and broadcast it in a heavily filtered Instagram pic. We feel more compelled than ever to feel good, and more guilty than ever to admit that we don\u0027t.Pastor and WriterRepublicans are trying to whip people into a frenzy, then convince them that only by taking extreme steps can their government keep them \"safe.\" And, of course, only Republicans have the you-know-whats to take those extreme steps because \"political correctness,\" blah, blah, blah.Author of \u0027Obama’s America: A Transformative Vision of Our National Identity\u0027There, just inside, is my mother -- or at least what\u0027s left of her. Today, I do not know who is in there. But I am damned if I am going to speak to her like the aged infant she appears to be. She deserves the dignity of being someone\u0027s mother and for this small while, I allow myself the indulgence of being her child.Editor at large, Tasting Table; author, \u0027Hi, Anxiety\u0027The president has the power to destroy the world. And the 2016 candidates -- Democratic and Republican -- have barely been asked about how they approach that terrible responsibility. Nuclear weapons are more dangerous than ISIS will ever be. They deserve a more serious debate.Senior Policy Analyst, Ploughshares FundTechnology is enabling entrenched interests, the middlemen, to be sidelined. This will mean lower fees, better service, and faster transactions -- and not having to deal with those annoying credit-card offers in the mail. Best of all, we won\u0027t need to carry paper money and credit cards any more.Academic, Researcher, Writer, EntrepreneurAlberto Burri, a surgeon who became a painter, preferred \"precarious equilibrium and masterful control of the unpredictable\". A once-in-a-lifetime exhibition at the Guggenheim is a dramatic example of an artist marching to his own drum and for any creative person, a source of passionate inspiration not to be missed.Culture Columnist, Huffington Post, CultureZohnDemocrats are split.One camp believes everything is okay, at least in presidential years, because the demographic trends favor us and because the Republicans are so damn good at alienating people. Another camp thinks we need to panic because the numbers of Democratic elected officials are so low and Hillary has weaknesses as a candidate.Co-Founder, Democracy PartnersWhat she has demonstrated in the current election cycle is an even higher degree of fluidity in this most singular of political communication formats. Her performance in Saturday night\u0027s debate in New Hampshire should give pause to her would-be Republican rivals. This is a woman who knows how to debate.Professor of Journalism, Northeastern University, BostonThe pursuit of the Republican presidential nomination requires appeal to an extreme right wing base that sees the world differently than the majority of Americans. This is particularly true on issues like immigration and the environment.Executive Director, Columbia University\u0027s Earth InstituteGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
