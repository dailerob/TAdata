{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AP/APTN07.27.2005 Arianna HuffingtonNot everyone in the Times building is on the same page when it comes to Judy Miller. The official story the paper is sticking to is that Miller is a heroic martyr, sacrificing her freedom in the name of journalistic integrity. But a very different scenario is being floated in the halls: It\u0027s July 6, 2003, and Joe Wilson\u0027s now famous op-ed piece appears in the Times, raising the idea that the Bush administration has \"manipulate[d]\" and \"twisted\" intelligence \"to exaggerate the Iraqi threat.\" Miller, who has been pushing this manipulated, twisted, and exaggerated intel in the Times for months, goes ballistic. Someone is using the pages of her own paper to call into question the justification for the war -- and, indirectly, much of her reporting. So she calls her friends in the intelligence community and asks, Who is this guy? She finds out he\u0027s married to a CIA agent. She then passes on the info about Mrs. Wilson to Scooter Libby. Maybe Miller tells Rove too -- or Libby does. The White House hatchet men turn around and tell Novak and Cooper. The story gets out. This is why Miller doesn\u0027t want to reveal her \"source\" at the White House and also explains why Miller never wrote a story about Plame -- because her goal wasn\u0027t to write a story but to get out the story that cast doubts on Wilson\u0027s motives. Which Novak did...read whole post | permalink | comments07.28.2005 Doug HellerWhen Rep. Chris Cox testified before the Senate Banking Committee about his nomination to head the SEC on Tuesday, he seems to have scooted over the honesty line. In response to questions about his past involvement in the First Pension investment scam that took unsuspecting small investors for $130 million and subsequent lawsuits, Cox said: \"I did preliminary work on a small SEC-registered public offering...[and] I had the entirety of the complaint dismissed against me, and there was no settlement of the matter either. I prevailed on the claim in the court.\" This statement was made under oath and was false in two respects and misleading in its entirety.read whole post | permalink | comments07.28.2005 Paul KrassnerAn article in the Los Angeles Times about Supreme Court nominee John Roberts states that his wife “has been active in the anti-abortion movement, a fact that some on both sides of the issue take to mean that John Roberts also opposes abortion.” Well, triple duh! When Roberts was Deputy Solicitor General under the first President Bush, he argued before the Supreme Court that Roe vs. Wade should be overturned. The prospect of this medical procedure actually becoming illegal again dismays me, particularly because of what I learned during my experience as an underground abortion referral service all through the ’60s.read whole post | permalink | comments07.28.2005 Dal LaMagnaThe Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund, approved by Congress in 2003, totaled $18.4 billion. Many of the reconstruction contracts were awarded to American companies. Many of those companies pulled in employees and sub-contractors from every place but Iraq. American companies are profiting while the unemployment rate in Iraq is between 25 and 50 percent and young people are offered a few hundred dollars to deposit bombs amongst the landscape and people.read whole post | permalink | comments07.28.2005 Richard BradleyPolice explained that they shot Jean Charles de Menezes, an innocent man, five times in the head because he was wearing a \"bulky jacket\" and had jumped the turnstile. \"I\u0027d like to see a photo of that bulky jacket,\" I wrote a few days ago. Now, of course, it turns out that Menezes neither jumped the turnstile nor was wearing a bulky jacket, unless you consider a jean jacket particularly cumbersome. Somehow I have the feeling that the more we learn about this incident, the more it\u0027s going to look like a collection of small [but significant] police mistakes, lack of training, and heightened anxiety. In other words, unjustifiable.read whole post | permalink | comments07.28.2005 Eric BoehlertIs Newsweek going to have to run a second correction next week in the wake of its reverential profile of Supreme Court nominee John Roberts, the one currently on newsstands? Not only did Newsweek get spun by the White House which claimed that Roberts never joined the right-wing legal group, the Federalist Society, which turned out to be wrong. But Newsweek also got spun by Roberts\u0027 buddies who insisted the Justice-to-be really didn\u0027t have much to do with the partisan legal wrangling during the 2000 Florida recount, which, if he did, might prove troublesome during his confirmation hearings.read whole post | permalink | comments07.27.2005 Rep. Major R. OwensA few nights ago, I had a dream about the Republicans. I was at a banquet, where they were celebrating the extension of the Voting Rights Act. Needless to say, there were a plethora of African Americans at this event, and as this whole celebration continued, even more Blacks started to magically appear. As our evening came to a regrettable end, “God Bless America” was sung by all and a multitude of benedictions were offered by African-American and Hispanic ministers as the theme banner opened up in large black block type: “REPUBLICAN RULE FOR A THOUSAND YEARS.”...read whole post | permalink | comments07.27.2005 Tom HaydenIraqi prime minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari says he wants the rapid withdrawal of US troops.

There was no media coverage. But the statement of the prime minister, standing next to Donald Rumsfeld, has to be reported. So is the war over? Hardly.

And it\u0027s hard work.read whole post | permalink | comments07.27.2005 Ari MelberPat Roberts, the Kansas Senator who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, announced this weekend that he\u0027ll hold hearings on how the CIA designates and protects undercover officers. Roberts explained to CNN that the \"outing\" of Valerie Plame makes these issues a \"big deal.\" But then he contradicted himself. After referencing Plame\u0027s \"outing,\" Roberts suggested she wasn\u0027t really outed because she wasn\u0027t really covert. Got that? \"From a common sense standpoint, driving back and forth to work to the C.I.A. headquarters, I don\u0027t know if that really qualifies as being, you know, covert.\" So Pat Roberts arrogantly believes he can retroactively determine which agents qualify as covert...read whole post | permalink | comments07.27.2005 Sandy FrankSaid Ibrahim, one of the men being sought in Britain in connection with the most recent subway attacks in London, reportedly told a neighbor he “was going to get 80 virgins when he got to heaven.” This is shocking. The 9/11 hijackers expected only 72 virgins. Virgin inflation of more than 11 percent in under 4 years? Such inflationary devaluing of virgins could lead to more terrorism. How many more suicide volunteers can we expect when the promise gets to 90 virgins? Or 100?read whole post | permalink | comments07.27.2005 Gayle SmithIt really doesn\u0027t take an empirical study to realize that our television networks have decided to close their eyes to genocide. But numbers sure speak volumes, and Nick Kristof\u0027s op-ed yesterday offered several -- including the almost unbelievable fact that the major nightly newscasts on NBC, CBS, and ABC featured just 26 minutes of Darfur coverage combined in all of 2004. And there\u0027s plenty more where that came from, as I can attest from first-hand knowledge.read whole post | permalink | comments07.27.2005 Geoffrey R. StoneEverything about John Roberts suggests a principled, pragmatic justice who will act cautiously and with a healthy respect for precedent. This does not mean, of course, that he will not vote to eviscerate Roe v. Wade or reject the rights of homosexuals or narrow the scope of affirmative action or expand the role of religion in public life or endorse the so-called \"new federalism.\" But if he does, it will be in an open-minded, rigorous, intellectually honest manner, rather than as an ideologue whose constitutional principles derive more from fiction and faith than from legal reason.read whole post | permalink | comments07.27.2005 Craig CrawfordAs we gear up for a big fight over abortion rights in the upcoming Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on Supreme Court nominee John Roberts, what cases would he participate in deciding if he becomes a justice? Here is the CQ Weekly look at what\u0027s ahead: Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood: A New Hampshire law requires abortion providers to give a minor’s parents 48 hours’ advance notice before the procedure, unless a judge grants an exemption or the girl’s life is at stake. “Partial Birth” Abortion Ban: Abortion rights groups are challenging a 2003 federal law that banned a late-term procedure opponents call “partial birth” abortion.read whole post | permalink | comments07.27.2005 Michael SmerconishWhy do they hate us? It’s a question that I have avoided for close to four years. Now I find myself re-assessing the situation. In large part, this is due to my having just spent a few hours with CIA veteran Michael Scheuer. Scheuer thinks we Americans continue to be sold a bill of goods, which fosters a misunderstanding of our enemy, and forestalls success in the war on terror. Specifically, we’re told that radical Islam hates us, and attacks us, for who we are and what we think, when that is not the case. It’s not McDonalds, Starbucks, lap dances and Brittany Spears – offensive though Muslims may find those hallmarks of American life. And it’s not about converting us to Islam. To the contrary, says Scheuer, what motivates radical Islam is American foreign policy.read whole post | permalink | comments07.27.2005 Dan CarolThe national energy bill produced by the House and Senate conference committee falls far, far short of the mark. In essence, members of the House Republican caucus continue to resist step one in the 12-step program we need -- admitting that we have an energy/oil problem. So while the Bush Administration may want to shout huzzah and cross “energy reform” off its list for a long time, the reality is that this energy bill is a drop in the bucket of what we need to do.read whole post | permalink | comments07.27.2005 Catherine IngramI am so tired of hearing Karl Rove referred to as a genius. It’s like saying the mob boss, known for getting his way by kneecapping people and stuffing bodies into car trunks, is a genius. It didn’t take genius to figure out the base fears of the religious right and the conservative heartland in the last election. The specter of gay people having the right to marry was one of several hot-button issues that anyone who reads the news could have predicted would inflame the red states. It didn’t take genius to exploit those fears; it took venality.read whole post | permalink | comments07.26.2005 David SirotaYou could make a credible argument that the DLC\u0027s corporatization/Republicanization of the Democratic Party was justified, had it led to electoral success for Democrats. Few would argue that today\u0027s split-the-difference Democratic Party hasn\u0027t followed the DLC\u0027s policy direction over the last 10 years. That means the last 10 years of elections really have been a referendum on whether the DLC\u0027s model actually wins at the polls. And that\u0027s when we get to the real problem with the DLC -- its policies are BOTH morally bankrupt, and politically disastrous.read whole post | permalink | commentsReuters/Larry DowningAP/Don RyanAP/Manuel Balce CenetaFrom abcnews.go.comFrom WSJ.comAP/Victor R.
