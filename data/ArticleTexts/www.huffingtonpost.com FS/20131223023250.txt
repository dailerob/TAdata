{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonBetween last minute shopping and jam-packed malls, roads and airports, this week delivered plenty of ruffled feathers beyond the Duck Dynasty uproar. One antidote to that holiday stress is a diet -- not abstaining from Christmas cookies but from our digital devices. So, starting tomorrow, I\u0027ll be powering mine down for a week, disconnecting from the world so I can more deeply connect with friends and family. It\u0027s a great way to recharge your internal batteries and promote reflection on the year gone by. For HuffPost, 2013 was a year in which we went all-in on our efforts to fight burnout and embrace that which we truly value. This included the launch of the Third Metric, a movement devoted to redefining success beyond just power and money to include well-being, wisdom, wonder and giving back. Making a digital diet part of your holiday tradition is a great way to start. So goodbye until next week -- and have a happy unplugged holiday.CommentsGeoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoOn the one hand, there are those who fervently defend everything the Intelligence Community does. On the other side, the critics of the NSA and of what they see as rampant and unrestrained government spying charge that any intrusion into individual privacy is a fundamental infringement of core American values.Comments (18)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundAs millions of Christians around the world prepare to celebrate Christmas and their belief that God entered human history as a poor tiny baby, let us remember all the poor babies and children who struggle to live and realize their God given potential in our own rich land and all around the world today.Comments (37)Bill Moyers and Michael WinshipThis grim anniversary of the Newtown, Conn., killings, with 28 dead, reminded us of that moment back in 2000 when Charlton Heston made his defiant boast at the NRA convention that gun control advocates would have to pry his rifle from his \"cold, dead hands.\"Comments (564)Arianna HuffingtonWith the holidays almost here, Cindi Leive, Mika Brzezinski and I have decided that there is no better time to unplug, recharge and renew ourselves in time for the new year.Comments (37)Nathaniel FrankAuthor, \u0027Unfriendly Fire: How the Gay Ban Undermines the Military and Weakens America\u0027The state -- at least the state of New Mexico -- does not privilege marriage as a way to make impulsive young men stick by their kids. It sanctions marriage to help strengthen the commitments of couples and families -- real families. And that includes gay ones.CommentsTEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"What can a pickpocket teach us about the art of getting people\u0027s attention? A lot - if you can keep up with him. Watch expert thief Apollo Robbins in action and see if you can figure out how he does it.Comments (27)Craig NewmarkFounder, craigslist and craigconnects.orgSometimes people in Washington do a really good job, but take a lot of crap unfairly. Sometimes it takes a \"nerd-in-residence\" to start to set the record straight.CommentsRev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkDo we really believe that a young teenager from an inner city or from a rural area who had a rough upbringing would receive time at a treatment facility if he/she killed four people after driving drunk? I don\u0027t think so, and neither do the majority of us.Comments (219)Robin BronkCEO, The Creative CoalitionAs a nation who leads the world in embracing the freedoms of speech and creativity, actresses and cultural icons like Pegah Ahangarani, must be supported in their quest to be the conscience of a nation.CommentsMohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOInvestors have responded favorably to the outcome of today\u0027s highly-anticipated Federal Reserve policy meeting, and rightly so. Here are four key takeaways that speak to more than this afternoon\u0027s impressive market moves; they also shed light on what may be ahead.Comments (34)Noah MichelsonEditor, HuffPost Gay VoicesWhile I love homophobes like Westboro Baptist Church for making my job easy, our real work is uncovering the wicked truth hiding beneath those who claim they love us while they bludgeon us with their Bibles.Comments (403)Michael RothPresident, Wesleyan UniversityAs president of Wesleyan, and as a historian, I deplore this politically retrograde resolution of the American Studies Assn. Under the guise of phony progressivism, the group has initiated an irresponsible attack on academic freedom. Others in academia should reject this call for an academic boycott.Comments (99)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarCelebrity weight loss stories are called out as destructive and anti-feminist. And yet, there\u0027s something refreshing -- and, perhaps, even healthy -- about those celebrities who publicly discuss their ups and downs.CommentsLewis LaphamEditor of Lapham\u0027s QuarterlyAll humor is situational, but the forms of it that survive the traveling in time speak to the fundamental truth of the human predicament, which is that men die from time to time and worms do eat them. The jokes dependent upon a specific historical setting don\u0027t have much of a shelf life.CommentsValerie AlexanderAuthor, \u0027Happiness as a Second Language\u0027Choose the man who will take care of the laundry and change the baby\u0027s diapers when you\u0027ve got the flu, rather than the one who spent a month choreographing his proposal so that the video of it would go viral.Comments (289)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027The remarkable acts of kindness and grace we see with Pope Francis are the natural response from a disciple who has known the kindness and grace of Christ in his own life.Comments (55)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistEvery year at this moment, the world begins to synchronize. Our many different cultures notwithstanding, there\u0027s something about the holidays that makes the planet communal. Even nations that do not celebrate Christmas can\u0027t help but be caught up in the collective spirit of their neighbors, as twinkling lights dot the landscape and carols fill the air. It\u0027s an inspiring time of the year.CommentsGordon BrownFormer Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationWe all now know of Mandela\u0027s strength of will and belief: his defiance facing possible execution, his resilience even faced with a 27-year prison sentence often in solitary detention. But I wanted also to tell the story of Graça, the heroine who guided Mandela through his last years.CommentsGrace BucheleBlogger, howibecametexan.comAs the \"white\" half of a Japanese-American couple, I noticed some of the same questions keep popping up again and again. After a quick chat with some other interracial couples, I realized my experiences were not unique.Comments (356)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorAs millions of Americans struggle with inadequate health care, low wages, deteriorating public services and uncertainty about their futures as the wage gap between the wealthy elite and the working poor widens, billions upon billions of taxpayer dollars are pouring into the coffers of the Department of Defense every year.Comments (23)Claire FallonDeputy Blog Editor, The Huffington PostTime may be running short to find the perfect gift for your daughter, niece, or younger sister before Christmas, but fear not: Bookstores will never...Comments (35)Tavis SmileyPBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorWhen she won an Oscar for her performance in 1985\u0027s Prizzi\u0027s Honor, Huston continued her family\u0027s extraordinary film legacy, which began with her grandfather, Walter Huston, and her father, John Huston. She\u0027s had memorable turns in film and on TV, most recently starring in the musical drama television series Smash.CommentsSoraya ChemalyFeminist, Writer, Satirist... not always in that orderHe is endearing and he\u0027s 6 and \"boys will be boys.\" But, the girl he kissed without permission is also probably endearing, also 6 and not interested in his touching her. The hard and unpleasant part is the idea that her right not to be involved in his working through learning self-control is legitimate.Comments (132)Russell SimmonsFounder, GlobalGrind.comHistory will judge this president not just for being the first black president, but for being the president that began our nation\u0027s course toward a more progressive union.Comments (59)Rev. Dr. Susan Brooks ThistlethwaiteProfessor of Theology, Chicago Theological SeminarySanta is kind of scary, especially when compared to Jesus. Santa is judgmental. Santa gives bribes for being good, and if you\u0027re not good, Santa doesn\u0027t forgive. He just puts coal in your stocking and moves on. Jesus will forgive you. That\u0027s the whole Gospel right there.Comments (84)Bernard-Henri LévyFrench philosopher and writerIt is impossible to predict what the situation in Ukraine will be by the time these lines appear. Already certain, however, is that the events of the past month are extraordinary in every respect.CommentsNathan AllenChemistIf a half-dozen volunteers can keep a page with more than 4 million users from being a microphone for the antiscientific, is it too much to ask for newspapers to police their own editorial pages as proficiently?Comments (458)Andrea MeyerWriterI do still wish, more than anything, that I had two children: Aidan and Nina. But now I know that longing for the daughter I lost does not mean I want a replacement.Comments (23)Ronni ThomasCreator and director, \u0027The Midnight Archive\u0027Why not take a few minutes between window shopping and sucking down Christmas cheer to celebrate the most fascinating, most allusive, most charming historical figure?Comments (50)Ann JonesAuthor, \u0027They Were Soldiers: How the Wounded Return From America’s Wars -- The Untold Story\u0027The JROTC program, still spreading in high schools across the country, costs U.S. taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars annually. It has cost some unknown number of taxpayers their children.Comments (113)Leigh Steinberg, 2013.22.12Zach J.
