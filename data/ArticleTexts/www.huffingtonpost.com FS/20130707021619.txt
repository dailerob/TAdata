{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOFor Egyptians, the army\u0027s exceptional intervention was necessary to reduce the risk of a large loss of human life and destructive violence. Most Egyptians still fear civil unrest and violence, especially in the next few days and weeks. They look to the army to waste no time in progressing on the path to national reconciliation and a comprehensive and durable democracy, including by holding new elections. Have no doubt, Egyptian citizens are determined realists. They have overcome the fear that imprisoned them for so long but they are yet to reach a new national equilibrium. They care deeply about overcoming repression, social injustice and economic incompetence. And they will not hesitate to return to the streets in their millions should the army have ambitions beyond helping them collectively to press the rest button on the revolution and its legitimate objectives.Comments (47)Louise LeakeyAssistant Research Professor of Anthropology, University of Stony BrookWhat the fossil record does is force us to contemplate our place on the planet. We are but one species of several hominids that inhabited planet earth and like our distant cousins who went extinct fairly recently, our time on planet earth is also finite.Comments (1,514)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarSelf-sufficiency isn\u0027t something most kids are born with. The school year, with its rigorous after-school sports and activity schedules, doesn\u0027t offer this sort of platform for learning how to be alone, or for knowing how to create their own fun -- a skill that\u0027s not only a good thing but also essential.Comments (193)Dr. Michael J. BreusClinical Psychologist; Board Certified Sleep SpecialistUnderstanding with greater specificity the health and lifestyle conditions that may increase risk of sleep apnea can lead to better screening and treatment options.Comments (32)Rebecca WoolfCo-founder, True Media Inc.Watching a boy learn to ride his bike reminded me that every moment we become better equipped to be here, more willing and able to move forward, to let go, to be free, to ride on.CommentsMarty KaplanDirector, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolSo when Mohamed Morsi was elected president of Egypt, or when Hamas and Hezbollah won elections in Gaza and Lebanon, some Committee on Core Beliefs should have had a veto over the outcome? What could possibly go wrong?Comments (151)Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoThe rationale for secrecy is that public disclosure of surveillance activities in these national security investigations would effectively undermine both ongoing and future investigations. It is difficult to assess the performance of the FISA court, because its activities are secret. But with 30 years of experience, it is possible to offer some reflections and suggestions.Comments (177)James ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Change is never easy and is most often messy. If the events of the last two years have demonstrated anything it is that the Egyptian people want change, they feel empowered to demand change, and, when it is not forthcoming, those in power will be held on a short leash that can be pulled back.Comments (24)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThis report, with its positive revisions, a whiff of increased labor force participation, and a bit of pop in wages suggests not just an improving job market, but one that\u0027s improving a bit faster than we thought.Comments (34)Nikolas KozloffAuthor, \u0027Revolution! South America and the Rise of the New Left\u0027If Obama\u0027s underlying objective was to intimidate Latin American nations over the Snowden affair, his strategy has colossally backfired. Indeed, much to the chagrin of the White House, Latin nations have rallied to Snowden\u0027s defense.Comments (22)Victor J. WilliPhD History, Oxford UniversityWhat happened yesterday is phenomenal and unprecedented in Egyptian history. While millions of Egyptians cheered and partied until in the early morning on June 30th, and then again yesterday, following the sacking of Morsi, there is, however, a flip side to the coin.Comments (246)Ahmed Shihab-EldinEmmy-Nominated Producer/Host, @HuffPostLiveI understand why so many (namely President Obama) are careful not to call this a coup. But whatever we call it, we must acknowledge the basic facts.Comments (581)Andrew CottoAuthorEvery parent I see is exhausted. In most cases, both parents have demanding, full-time jobs, while the one with the less demanding job often also gets the role of primary caregiver, though both parents are heavily involved. Some of us have help; most of us don\u0027t. Either way, we\u0027re worn out.Comments (35)Barry LandoAuthor, \u0027Web of Deceit\u0027Since the fall of Mubarak, the military have feared not just a takeover by radical Muslims. There is also the fact that real civilian rule could spell an end to the system of massive military corruption and patronage that has gone on for decades in Egypt.Comments (144)Dr. Carmen HarraAuthor, clinical psychologist and relationship expertIf you believe the phrase you are what we think, then life truly stems from your thoughts. But we cannot rely purely on thoughts; we must translate thoughts into words and eventually into actions in order to manifest our intentions.Comments (13)Kathy CaprinoWomen\u0027s success coach, leadership trainer, writer and speaker dedicated to advancing womenMost of us spend more waking hours working than doing anything else, and I can tell you from firsthand experience that if you don\u0027t like your work, it won\u0027t like you back, and overly-stressful, misaligned work can very easily make your body break down.Comments (15)Arianna HuffingtonMandela\u0027s leadership lessons will belong to the ages, just as Lincoln\u0027s leadership lessons do. Two very different men, but they shared the same defining qualities that we need in the 21st century.Comments (303)Renee FisherAuthor, SpeakerKnow that more people than you might suspect have been to nude beaches. Your friendly mailman, your manicurist, your best friend are all suspect. Nude beachgoers and nude beaches are everywhere. Of course, you can fly off to any one of a number of gorgeous warm weather resorts. But you have the option of staying closer to home.Comments (86)Christopher ElliottAuthor, How to Be the World\u0027s Smartest Traveler (and Save Time, Money, and Hassle)I think there is a line when it comes to airline fees. I think everyone knows it, even a discount airline like Spirit. We may disagree about where the line is, but we all know it exists. Personally, I think we\u0027ve crossed it, but my opinion doesn\u0027t matter.CommentsLindsay MillerLA Editor, PopSugarMy own romantic relationship may not have been what society at large expected. But as I read those words and champagne flutes clinked in solidarity, I knew my mom and Ray -- and Martin and I -- perfectly fit the description of love I\u0027d tried capturing.CommentsJanus AdamsEmmy Award-winning journalist, historian and producerFounding Fathers, you got it together by making a few compromises. How\u0027s it working for you now? The bargaining chips you played then -- slaves, women, Native Americans -- are still being played today.Comments (398)Ekow N. YankahProfessor of Law, Cardozo School of LawOn this Fourth of July, it is the basic realization that rolling up your sleeves and being a part of your political community, rather than grasping at a fuzzy picture of a cowboy alone on a plain, is the true display of virtue.Comments (388)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027What do I love about America? I especially love our best national values: freedom, opportunity, community, justice, human rights, and equality under the law for all of our citizens of every race, creed, culture, and gender, not just for the rich and powerful.Comments (420)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureIt\u0027s time to remember these forgotten Americans -- our brothers and sisters, our neighbors, friends and children -- and to take action to help them. In this time of celebrated patriotism, anything less is hypocrisy.Comments (161)Tiffiniy ChengCo-founder, Fight for the FutureWhat the NSA is doing is criminal. It\u0027s immoral. And it goes against everything this country is supposed to be about.Comments (765)Vivian NorrisPh.D. focusing on Globalization and Media StudiesPeople will be talking about Senator Davis\u0027 filibuster for many years to come. Those who have made, and will make the trip to the capitol in Austin to make their voices heard, will become politicized forever. They will not forget the energy and solidarity which we have witnessed.Comments (829)FoodbeastJuly 4 is about eating well, sitting back and enjoying each other\u0027s company. Except when it\u0027s not...CommentsJennifer Bradley and Bruce KatzIn the absence of constructive action in Washington, cities and metropolitan areas have emerged as the can-do directors of the nation, taking powerful steps to grow jobs and remake their economies for the long haul.Comments (45)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorIn an age of increased jingoism about freedom and American ideals, the comparative yardsticks of patriotism should be applied frequently and meticulously to the large U.S. corporations that rove the world seeking advantages from other countries, to the detriment of the United States.Comments (668)Violeta AyalaBolivian filmmakerI think we can say for certain that all the countries involved in this little saga knew Snowden wasn\u0027t on or anywhere near the Bolivian presidential jet. But what if, hypothetically Snowden was able to sneak past the FSB, Russian police, airport security and get on that plane?Comments (75)Cesar MillanFounder of the Cesar Millan FoundationWhen the fireworks are going off this year, pay attention to how your dogs react, and which of these techniques help the most. Make notes, then plan ahead for next year. July 5th is the best day to start the process of preparing your dog for next year\u0027s festivities.Comments (41)Riva Greenberg, 2013. 6.07Roger Hickey, 2013. 6.07Randy Hain, 2013. 6.07Stephenie Zamora, 2013. 6.07Sandy Weiner, 2013. 6.07Pamela Feinsilber, 2013. 6.07Robert Hii, 2013. 6.07Stephen Knudsen, 2013. 6.07Taufiq Rahim, 2013. 6.07David Mizejewski, 2013. 6.07Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"CRASH ROCKS S.F.",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
