{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressThe latest wrinkle in the debate over the so-called fiscal cliff is the attempt by House Speaker John Boehner to get his fellow Republicans to swallow his \"Plan B\" -- essentially a proposal that would allow taxes to be hiked on millionaires in order to prevent a deal from being born that\u0027s more amenable to President Barack Obama. If we are more poised to \"go over\" the \"cliff\" now than we were before, it\u0027s because \"Plan B\" has been deemed a complete non-starter by a White House who -- once again! -- was willing to make a deal on reforms to earned-benefit programs like Medicare that would make previous Republican House caucuses so numb from happiness and hugging that you\u0027d think they\u0027d been slipped a potent dose of Ecstasy.

Pure folly!\"Read Post | Comments (43)Arianna Huffington, 12/17/12Mass shootings have become a defining feature of modern America. Yet on the issue of gun violence, President Obama has shown a gift for eloquent rhetoric but no follow-through. What we need now is not another national conversation but action -- starting with a ban on the sale of weapons that are only good for mass murder.Read Post | Comments (1,501)Jon Soltz, 12/19/12Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranIf William Kristol wants to have a real debate on the real issues, let\u0027s have it.

You can have your guns, but you have responsibilities.Read Post | Comments (2,466)Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, 12/19/12Rabbi and WriterChallenging God in the face of suffering is not blasphemous.
