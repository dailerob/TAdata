{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week, America finally turned its attention to the urgent problem of its bridges -- or at least one bridge. As a media storm erupted over a traffic jam on the George Washington Bridge, accountability for our nation\u0027s crumbling infrastructure continued to cruise right by. Maybe we could divert some of those lanes of outrage toward the fact that nearly 80,000 American bridges are falling apart. This week also marked the 50th anniversary of the War on Poverty. From 1964 to 1973, the poverty rate fell from 19 to 10 percent. But over the ensuing years, it\u0027s climbed to 15 percent, as the War on Poverty has become a War on Poor People. An estimated 6.8 million people could put poverty in their rear view mirror with a proposed increase of the minimum wage to $10.10. But like a \"traffic study\" on the Jersey side of the George Washington Bridge, our leaders\u0027 desire to truly fight a war on poverty seems endlessly stalled.Comments (31)Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOI am a believer in the role of incentives in an economy, including how badly-aligned incentives can result in sub-optimal outcomes. But I find it hard to make the case here given the evidence on the extent and duration of long-term unemployment.Comments (177)Barbra StreisandSinger; Actress; Director; Composer; ActivistIf you wonder why Republicans really undermine the ACA daily, maybe they are worried about its eventual success. Remember the GOP also largely opposed Medicare.Comments (309)Arianna HuffingtonOccasionally unplugging from all our devices and techno-distractions is one of those seemingly small adjustments that actually have the power to transform the way we see the world, live our lives and interact with the people who matter most to us.Comments (17)Kirk DouglasActorPope Francis is a man who wants us to understand each other no matter what our differences may be and to do our best to help one another. And that is the core of what every religion should be.Comments (110)Mika BrzezinskiCo-host, MSNBC’s \u0027Morning Joe\u0027When I put the phone down, I felt weird, incomplete, like I wasn\u0027t wearing a bra or something. At times during the beginning of the vacation, I actually held the phone even though it was off. It was like weaning: The turned-off phone was my binky.Comments (18)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027Both liberals and conservatives could and should support all three crucial ingredients to overcoming poverty with opportunity: work, education, and family. Let\u0027s redeem this historic moment of declaring war on poverty by finally doing what it will take to win it -- together.Comments (219)Cindi LeiveEditor-in-chief, Glamour; author, \u0027100 Recipes Every Woman Should Know\u0027Unplugging was harder than it looked -- for the first few days I had phantom-phone syndrome, the constant urge during any spare second of time to reach for my small, rectangular best friend. But I persevered. Four things I discovered...Comments (16)Lance BassSinger, actor, producer, writer, entrepreneur and philanthropistFor my family, they still live in ground zero of intolerance for the LGBT community and have the unique pressure of having a well known gay relative. When I came out, they came out.Comments (488)Randi WeingartenPresident, American Federation of TeachersWill the powers-that-be continue to be more concerned with creating a testing and data system that ranks and sorts schools and educators, in the quest for the perfect industrial algorithm to judge teachers, students and schools? Or will they look at the evidence and join educators, students and parents in fighting to reclaim the promise of public education?Comments (53)Lawrence LessigAuthor, \u0027Republic, Lost\u0027; Founder, RootstrikersOn Saturday, we begin a walk across the state of New Hampshire, to launch a campaign to bring about an end to the system of corruption that we believe infects DC. This is the New Hampshire Rebellion.Comments (28)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundCharging children and youths as adults and incarcerating them with adults is the opposite of an effective intervention that helps young people turn their lives around and decreases crime. It makes our communities less safe.Comments (61)Tavis SmileyPBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorAmong my guests was Greg Kaufmann, who writes about poverty for The Nation magazine. In the clip below, he shares his views about whether -- 50 years after President Lyndon B. Johnson declared War on Poverty -- there is anything President Obama can do to further the cause.Comments (25)Nadia TolokonnikovaActivist, Pussy Riot band member\"They beat you once, then may come grab your hair, hit your head on the sewing machine or take you into a punishment cell, there they kick you using hands, legs, or remove the belt from a sewing machine and thrash you with it.\"Comments (32)Adam GrantWharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027Admitting defeat, I was dragged onto Twitter kicking and screaming. I thought it was a necessary evil. And I was wrong. In the past year, I\u0027ve grown fond of Twitter. It might be partially due to cognitive dissonance. But it\u0027s also due to six benefits that no one mentioned.Comments (16)Gordon BrownFormer Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationBy standing up to a terrorist, this extraordinary boy saved countless lives and should join the ranks of those whose actions define the word courage. This teenager thought his school important enough to defend and he had an instinctive sense that if the militants were allowed to destroy his school, they were taking away something valuable from his community.Comments (21)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future\"Different\"? Christie embodies his party perfectly. Arrogant? Check. Bullying? Check. Indifferent to the well-being of constituents? Check. He may sound like a different kind of Republican, but he governs the same way the others do. Meet the new GOP, same as the old GOP.Comments (228)TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"What if the best way to help kids learn is to stop trying so hard to keep them safe? Hear popular TED speaker Gever Tulley\u0027s radical argument for letting kids play with power tools and other things that will make parents squirm.Comments (105)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholar-Ish is, no doubt, convenient, the drive-thru of adjectives. I\u0027ll give it that. But, like a steady diet of fast food, -ish, not used in moderation, will catch up to you.CommentsCarly PaulLiving in ColoradoThis is how I came to be in poverty\u0027s grip. It was not overnight, and it was not all because of me, and not all because a system that failed me, and not all because of a dysfunctional family, and not all because of overblown capitalism, and not all because of any one thing.Comments (273)Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoIn my judgment the existing program is unconstitutional. As currently structured, it violates the Fourth Amendment\u0027s requirement of \"reasonableness.\" On the other hand, it should be possible for the government to correct the deficiencies in the program in a manner that both preserves its legitimate value and substantially mitigates the risks to privacy that it currently poses.Comments (33)Eric BoehlertSenior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaChristie\u0027s coverage has been a long-running, and rather extreme, case of personality trumping substance. But now the bridge bombshell casts all of that flattering coverage into question.Comments (59)Sen. Richard BlumenthalU.S. Senator from ConnecticutCreated with the intent of making the league sustainable, blackout policies today punish fans rather than encouraging attendance. With the average NFL ticket costing about $80, many fans who have not recovered from the recession simply cannot afford to attend. It is time to improve the deal for fans.Comments (12)Dr. Mae JemisonNASA astronaut, first woman of color in spaceThe word bothered me greatly years ago, as aviatrix, a feminization of aviator, seemed to make their accomplishments parenthetical. But I think of it differently these days as I understand the women of that era were different than the men -- they had to be \"more.\"CommentsRep. Chellie PingreeCongresswoman (D-ME)Earlier this week, John Boehner said he would only bring an extension of benefits to a vote under two conditions: spending cuts to pay for them and \"provisions ... to get our economy moving again and put Americans back to work.\" Sadly, the first condition is par for the course. But it\u0027s the second condition that really gets me.Comments (28)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action Networkhen issues like women\u0027s reproductive rights, unemployment benefits, marriage equality, economic fairness, education, immigration reform, a minimum wage increase and affordable health care are on the line, how can anyone think that making promises or a new year\u0027s resolution is enough?CommentsLina EscoDirector, \u0027Free the Nipple\u0027If an average teenager in America sees thousands of humans killed on TV shows by the time they\u0027re 18 I believe they can handle a nipple.Comments (299)Matt WalshBlogger, talk radio host, father of twinsNow, to speak directly to a certain terrifying subset of this species. These are the lowest, most shameless sorts of customers. Their existence is a constant, chilling reminder that evil exists in the world. They are the non-tippers.Comments (2,012)Charles F. Bolden, Jr.Administrator of NASAAt a time when women and minorities were rarely seen in the cockpit of an airplane, Amelia Earhart\u0027s pioneering achievements broke the silence barrier, inspired a nation and paved the way for so many others who have followed in her path.CommentsVanessa ElizabethTravel Blogger: wander the world with me at www.wanderonwards.com.If your love is truly eternal, what\u0027s the rush? If it\u0027s real, that person will continue to be committed to you two months from now, two years from now, and two decades from now. Grow, learn, travel, party, cuddle, read, explore. Do. Freaking. Something... other than \"settle down\" at 23 with a white picket fence.Comments (86)Alissa ParkerBlogger, TheParkerFive and co-founder, safeandsoundschools.orgThe year anniversary was just one of many many ways we have felt connected to our little Em. So, as cliché as it might sound, I know I didn\u0027t get my goodbye that day because she has never truly left us.CommentsDanny Groner, 2014.12.01Aysha Akhtar, M.D., M.P.H., 2014.12.01Marwan Bishara, 2014.12.01Mike Weisser, 2014.12.01Anthony W.
