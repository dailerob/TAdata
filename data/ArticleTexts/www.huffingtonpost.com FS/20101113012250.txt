{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Douglas Schoen and Patrick Caddell are best known for going on the Fox News Channel, where they pretend to be \"Democratic strategists.\" But unlike virtually every other Democratic strategist in the Western world, the two men show a studied disinterest in and a complete antipathy for any of the philosophies for which the Democratic Party is best known. Their advice for President Barack Obama? Quit. That\u0027s sure to send a powerful message of leadership and responsibility.Read Post | CommentsCharles Ferguson, 11.12.2010Director of the Wall Street documentary \u0027Inside Job\u0027The United States is now in the grip of a political duopoly in which both parties are thoroughly complicit. The current arrangement all but guarantees the continuing decline of the United States as a nation.Read Post | CommentsJane Smiley, 11.12.2010Pulitzer Prize-Winning Novelist and EssayistWhen I asked my older daughter what she thought of my divorce from her father (she is 32), she said, \"Do you really think I wish we had remained in that suffocating little four-person family?\"Read Post | CommentsRussell Simmons, 11.12.2010Founder of GlobalGrind.comFor centuries, our people have relentlessly tread water as hard as they could to stay afloat, and here we were, literally drowning, and it felt like the president was insensitive. There is no need to apologize, Kanye.Read Post | CommentsCenk Uygur, 11.12.2010Host of The Young TurksGlenn Beck has told a lie so grotesque that it goes beyond the pale of even dirty politics. Just when I thought he couldn\u0027t shock my conscience anymore, he has done it. Let me explain.Read Post | CommentsRichard (RJ) Eskow, 11.12.2010Consultant, Writer, Senior Fellow with The Campaign for America\u0027s FutureSo-called \"deficit hawks\" like Kent Conrad, Erskine Bowles, and Alan Simpson aren\u0027t just unserious. They\u0027re radicals. Their positions are an extreme departure from the philosophy of government that\u0027s guided American policy for a century.Read Post | CommentsRep. Brad Miller, 11.12.2010Representative, North CarolinaSocial Security, and the long-term deficit are completely distinct. Proposing to \"reform\" Social Security because of long-term deficits is like invading Iraq because Afghanistan attacked us.Read Post | CommentsLila Shapiro, 11.12.2010Associate Blog EditorWhere does Ames end and his character begin? He says, \"Jonathan the character is wonderfully more brave and delusional than I am, which enables him to take on things that he shouldn\u0027t.\"Read Post | CommentsSteve Clemons, 11.11.2010Publisher of \"The Washington Note\"I can\u0027t help wondering whether Cindy McCain misses her straight-talking husband as much as I do -- a McCain that is going to be relevant to our future, not one we have to be ashamed of because he \"delayed\" the normalization of gay rights.Read Post | CommentsRabbi Shmuley Boteach, 11.12.2010Rabbi and writerLost in the debate about the morality of the Tea Party is any discussion about its underpinnings in human nature. The Tea Party is far from perfect, but in emphasizing self-reliance, it taps into the human desire to live a life with self-esteem.Read Post | CommentsSimon Johnson, 11.12.2010MIT Professor and co-author of 13 BankersVikram Pandit heads Citigroup, one of the world\u0027s largest and most powerful banks. He\u0027s a smart individual -- why then does he advance such obviously specious arguments? The answer is straightforward: he can get away with it.Read Post | CommentsAmitai Etzioni, 11.12.2010GWU ProfessorWhen no raindrops follow the rainmakers\u0027 dance, they claim the dance was not properly performed. Our generals are using the same rationale to keep our engagement going in Afghanistan.Read Post | CommentsClaire Gordon, 11.12.2010Yale graduate studentNostalgia is not a reason to resist technology. It\u0027s a feeling with an imaginary object: a simpler time that wasn\u0027t really simpler, family bliss that wasn\u0027t really blissful, community that was really just as frayed as now.Read Post | CommentsLes Leopold, 11.12.2010Author, \"The Looting of America\"The real mystery of our current economic mess is how quiet progressives are. We seem constitutionally incapable of facing the enormity of the employment crisis. Why? Part of the answer lies in our permanent attachment to the Democratic Party.Read Post | CommentsClarence B. Jones, 11.12.2010Scholar in Residence, Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute at Stanford UniversityThe White House is stuck in some parallel universe disconnected from reality. They still think the president\u0027s problem was one of developing a more effective way of communicating his message. The problem is the message, not it\u0027s communication.Read Post | CommentsRob Johnson, 11.12.2010Director of Economic Policy, Roosevelt Institute, NewDeal2.0These are money party recommendations from a Commission appointed by two money parties that survive on money to conjure votes through media expenditure in a money politics distorted framework.Read Post | CommentsDave Zirin, 11.12.2010Sports correspondent for the Nation MagazineLebron has in the past expressed his admiration of Ali. This new ad, though, is like expressing your admiration for Dr. King by launching \"I Have A Dream Cereal\" or a laxative called \"We Shall Not Be Moved.\"Read Post | CommentsLynn Parramore, 11.12.2010Editor of New Deal 2.0; Co-founder of RecessionwireIt was clear that cash was king in the elections, so I spoke with Roosevelt Institute Senior Fellow Thomas Ferguson, the leading authority on money in politics, on the problems with campaign finance and where Wall Street\u0027s loyalties really lie.Read Post | CommentsAri Melber, 11.12.2010Correspondent for The NationThe Blue Dogs are right about campaign strategy in some conservative districts -- but they greatly overstate their case. Granularity is usually lost in our political narrative, and the numbers suggest subtle, diverging politics.Read Post | CommentsJohann Hari, 11.11.2010Columnist for the London IndependentClegg is one of the great mysteries of British politics. In just a few days after the election, he cleared a space in his swanky new ministerial offices and staged a bonfire of his principles.Read Post | CommentsMike Lux, 11.12.2010Author, The Progressive Revolution: How the Best in America Came to BeThe politics on the deficit commission are predictable, but they are another sign of how far removed D.C.-style centrism is from where the American public actually is.Read Post | CommentsGilbert B. Kaplan, 11.12.2010Former Deputy Assistant and Acting Assistant Secretary of the U. S. Department of CommerceAmerica has sent a strong message: we will not sit idly by while the folks in Washington ignore the jobs situation. And yet by not acting, that is exactly what the Senate will be doing.Read Post | CommentsLee Camp, 11.12.2010Comedian commentator featured on ABC, PBS, Comedy Central, Al Jazeera \u0026 Showtime; www.LeeCamp.netRead Post | CommentsPaul Raushenbush, 11.11.2010Religion Editor for the Huffington PostIf we keep our hearts open to the wisdom that Sam gathered in his short life, we can hear him inspiring us to transform our life for the better. We can hear him say to us: Yes, yes, yes!Read Post | CommentsJeff Madrick, 11.11.2010Senior Fellow, Roosevelt InstituteThe draft proposal released yesterday by the two chairmen of President Obama\u0027s fiscal commission is conceived and written in panic. It is a profoundly ideological and entirely unrealistic set of policy prescriptions.Read Post | CommentsAaron Sorkin, 11.11.2010Playwright, screenwriter and television writerIf you really want to honor our troops you won\u0027t use them for an easy applause line, you won\u0027t use them to get votes, or, most insulting to them of all, to divide us into real Americans and fake Americans.Read Post | CommentsYoani Sanchez, 2010.11.13David Isenberg, 2010.11.13Richard Grenell, 2010.11.12Lawrence Lessig, 2010.11.12Cecile Richards, 2010.11.12Chris Weigant, 2010.11.12William McNulty, 2010.11.12Robert Greenwald and Tanene Allison, 2010.11.12Esther Iverem, 2010.11.12HuffPost TV, 2010.11.12","h1":"Using a mobile device?
