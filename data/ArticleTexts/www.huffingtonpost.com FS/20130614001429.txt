{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonIf you are one of the many of people who believe that Plan A of the way business is managed -- aka the status quo -- is not working, this is a good day for you. Because I\u0027m happy to announce the launch of the B Team, whose mission is to introduce a Plan B. As an inaugural member of the B Team, I\u0027ve been inspired by the way the co-founders of the team, Richard Branson and Jochen Zeitz, and the other inaugural leaders, have been determined to change the values that drive businesses, to \"prioritize people and planet alongside profit\" and to move beyond our obsession with quarterly earnings and short-term growth. This is a moment of great possibility and opportunity for all of us to play our part in course-correcting, and leveraging the best parts of the spirit of business and entrepreneurship to bring about fundamental changes to the ways we do business -- for the benefit of individuals, communities, and companies.Comments (339)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027There are two great centers of unaccountable power in the American political-economic system today -- places where decisions that significantly affect large numbers of Americans are made in secret, and are unchecked either by effective democratic oversight or by market competition.Comments (12)Pedro AlmodóvarFilm director and producerI\u0027m sitting at the keyboard in my briefs and t-shirt. I can see Fifth Avenue through my windows. I take advantage of this seclusion to interview myself.CommentsLeighton WoodhouseCo-founder, DogParkMedia.comOne of the most disturbing realities the surveillance revelations have brought into relief is that in its drive to safeguard national security, the Obama Administration has concocted tactics that draw a sharp line dividing the state and the public, casting the latter in the role of potential conspirator.Comments (301)Valerie JarrettSenior Advisor and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsTo compete on an even playing field, we need to create our own field with teammates that respect and support what it takes for us to be healthy and whole.Comments (32)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorIt is not enough to show rising inequality and wring your hands and rend your garment. You\u0027ve got to explain why it\u0027s problematic.CommentsDavid BromwichProfessor of Literature, Yale UniversityThe architects of behavior will thus be warranted in telling the people that they can win back the confidence of the government only by redoubled efforts. Would it not be easier in that case for the government to dissolve the people and elect another?Comments (38)Rebecca SolnitAuthor, \u0027A Paradise Built in Hell\u0027One summer some years ago, on a peninsula jutting off another peninsula off the west coast of Iceland, I lived among strangers and birds. That summer among the terns, I lived at latitude 65, about as far north as Fairbanks, Alaska, and one degree south of the Arctic Circle.CommentsRebecca CertnerPhD candidate, Northeastern UniversityIf one manages to look beyond the incendiary swashbuckling and dragon hatchlings perched atop naked women, it becomes apparent that Game of Thrones is chock full of science.CommentsHoward FinemanEditorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupWhatever his flaws, the United States and its allies are counting on Erdogan. They need him to not fail. They don’t want a coup, either from the right (the army) or the Islamists.Comments (255)Jeanette SolomonWriterI have a shameful secret: I used to be really snotty about books.Comments (25)Rep. Luis GutierrezCongressman Representing Illinois\u0027 4th District in ChicagoWhen a Republican Member of Congress uses a term like \"wetback,\" I generally write it off to the insensitivity of individuals of a certain age. But when almost every Republican votes to deport DREAMers and many other sensible Republicans propose the enforcement-only son-of-H.R 4437, I am genuinely offended.Comments (750)Tom Zeller Jr.Senior Writer, The Huffington PostVirtually no one should be surprised to learn that climate talks currently underway in Bonn, Germany -- the latest venue for the decades-old and largely fruitless pursuit of international agreement on global warming action -- are descending into chaos.Comments (596)Ozan VarolAssistant Professor of Law at Lewis \u0026 Clark Law SchoolHistory has prominent examples that demonstrate the power of non-violent resistance against government repression. The Turks are in the process of crafting a story that exemplifies how the power of humor and innovation can be effectively harnessed against repression and abuse.Comments (133)Anthony EdwardsActorIt was three months ago when the network decided to pull Zero Hour off the air. I didn\u0027t take it personally, I know its business. I was just sad for all the great actors, talented technicians and artists who but their hearts and time into telling this story.CommentsPaula Davis-LaackLawyer turned stress \u0026 resilience expertPeople often get stuck because of fear, guilt, or simply not knowing which way to go next. In order to achieve bigger goals, take smaller steps.Comments (80)Jeff DanzigerPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideComments (92)Ben KosinskiFounder, SumptoSnapchat is the Las Vegas of social networks -- what happens in Snapchat, stays in Snapchat... or does it?CommentsMike JulianelleBlogger, DadandBuried.comOf course, being exhausted is not just for parents. Once you hit a certain age, energy is just harder to come by; pretty much everyone I know is exhausted all the time. It\u0027s just life. But as a parent, there is one primary reason I am always so tired.Comments (76)Gavin ShulmanWriter, ProducerNot to deflate everyone\u0027s false sense of pride and outrage but no one gives a damn about who you are calling and emailing. Please, don\u0027t flatter yourself.CommentsJohn Shelby SpongRetired American Bishop of the Episcopal ChurchAlmost any poll of regular church goers will reveal that their favorite book in the New Testament is the Gospel of John. Yet, I suspect that if these devotees of John\u0027s Gospel were introduced to the world of Johannine scholarship, they would be both shocked and angered by contemporary insights into this treasured book.Comments (1,011)Angelina ChapinBlogs Editor, Huffington Post CanadaGirl does on date. Guy is creepy. Touches-her-bum-when-she-doesn\u0027t-want-him-to creepy. Guy is also a famous Canadian radio personality. Roughly a year later, girl writes a blog about it. That blog goes viral. Should we believe her story?Comments (16)Teresa HsiaoTV writer (most recently for Family Guy), Boston sports fan, bad dancerYou might be skeptical that Ryan Seacrest is, indeed, Jesus. But there is ample evidence suggesting this to be true.CommentsAnn BrenoffSenior Writer, The Huffington PostIgnorance, when it comes to your health, isn\u0027t bliss. It\u0027s trouble. It\u0027s taking unnecessary risks and missing out on less-invasive treatment options that are available only when there\u0027s been early detection.CommentsJoanna MontgomeryWife, mother, writer, survivorWe talk about not \"sweating the small stuff\" and \"going with the flow,\" but how many of us really practice this in our lives? I don\u0027t know why any of us has to have a near death experience to chill the eff out -- it doesn\u0027t have to be that way, does it?CommentsNational Trust for Historic PreservationSave the Past. Enrich the Futureust two weeks ago, I found myself in Cleveland on a sort of mini vacation/sabbatical. Now, if a record-scratch moment just happened in your head, let me confirm that you did, in fact, read that correctly. I went to Cleveland for vacation.Comments (18)Caci CooperOperations AnalystI reflected on the things I wish I\u0027d known about or been told about before the wedding. The taboo things, the uncomfortable bits, the parts that you just don\u0027t talk about or maybe even the advice I was told but didn\u0027t believe. Hopefully they\u0027ll help another bride (or groom) to be.Comments (53)Jenny QiGraduate student, Biomedical SciencesIt\u0027s the illogical shame you feel when you take a few minutes to eat lunch instead of keeping vigil by your loved one\u0027s deathbed. It\u0027s the useless guilt you feel for making your friends feel awkward when you\u0027re sad.CommentsRichard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureOn one side are the forces of egalitarianism, economic opportunity, and self-determination. On the other is a well-funded and entrenched elite bent on hijacking our media, our political process, and our institutions, for their selfish ends.Comments (24)Robert WeissFounding Director, The Sexual Recovery InstituteAre you more worried about your kid being injured in Afghanistan or sexually assaulted by a fellow service member? It\u0027s tough to know where the biggest danger lies, since it seems like every time we turn on the news another episode of serious sexual misconduct is being uncovered.Comments (25)Josh SugarmannExecutive director, Violence Policy CenterThe NRA and its \"corporate partners\" in the gun industry have opposed and blocked even the smallest steps forward to regulate firearms. This kind of obstruction has consequences for real people: families left bereft, communities devastated.Comments (36)Carl Safina, 2013.13.06Jared Bernstein, 2013.13.06Robert Reich, 2013.13.06Anthony Edwards, 2013.13.06Kim Corsaro, 2013.13.06Michael Shank, 2013.13.06Brad Friedman and Desi Doyen, 2013.13.06Frank Bua, 2013.13.06Cynthia Catania, 2013.13.06Daniel Pena, 2013.13.06Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"U.S.: SYRIA\u0027S GONE CHEMICAL",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
