{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jason LinkinsEditor, Eat the PressIf you read enough Beltway reporting, you will probably die pretty quickly of intellectual dysentery. But for those whose hearty constitutions allow them to stick it out, it is inevitable that once you\u0027ve inundated yourself in political reporting, you\u0027ll run across lots and lots and lots of pieces that are primarily about \"messaging\" -- who is winning at \"messaging\" and who is losing at \"messaging.\" See, lawmakers have policies they want to see enacted. But a lot of those policies really suck canal water. That\u0027s where \"messaging\" comes in -- it\u0027s the gloss and fuss that dresses up everyone\u0027s ideas. Typically, just about everyone in Washington believes that almost anything can be sold if you just tell a good enough story about it. I suppose that can be true in a few limited instances. But the truth of the matter is that if everyone who plies their trade in politics were some sort of silver-tongued pitchman super-genius, then they wouldn\u0027t ply their trade in politics.Comments (143)Jason Vargo and Jonathan PatzCities in the U.S. have been struggling to \u0027pave their way out of congestion\u0027 for decades. It doesn\u0027t work.CommentsLisa BelkinSenior Columnist, The Huffington PostI have been very public about my disagreement with those who would have guns in homes with children, and even going so far as to call it lax parenting. But is it criminal? And is punishing parents when children do the wrong thing the way to keep other children from doing the same?Comments (558)Brett GallaherFounder, WeOccupyJesus.orgThis may come as a shock, but despite what your ex says about you, you\u0027re probably not going to Hell. Relieved? Good! But I hate to break it to you that your ex isn\u0027t going to Hell either.CommentsDiane RavitchHistorian, NYU professorThe international test scores are poor economic barometers. What matters most in the decades ahead is the extent to which we cultivate creativity, ingenuity, curiosity, innovation, and thinking differently.Comments (125)Andrew BacevichAuthor, \u0027The Limits of Power: The End of American Exceptionalism\u0027The United States has been at war for well over a decade now. Yet the recent debate over Syria evoked expressions of concern in Washington that Americans were once more turning their backs on the world.Comments (20)Keli GoffAuthor and Special Correspondent, TheRoot.comThe words \"tasteful\" and \"understated\" are rarely used in the same sentence as the name Kardashian, so it was no surprise that the latest Kardashian-related news to dominate headlines was yet another story about over-the-top opulence, wrapped in one big, gigantic bow of questionable taste.Comments (45)Adam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; co-founder of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911Not a week goes by without another story of an adult doing something colossally stupid on social media and paying the price. So why in the world did Facebook think it advisable to allow 13-year-old kids to make their pictures and status updates public?Comments (17)Carolyn GregoireFeatures Editor, Huffington Post Healthy LivingTrivializing and misusing a sacred tradition to sell luxury (not to mention sizeist) yoga clothing is not only embarrassing, it\u0027s offensive.Comments (135)Clif DickensGraphic designerComments (187)Emma GrayEditor, HuffPost WomenI still maintain that sipping a glass of wine with friends is one of life\u0027s greatest pleasures. The ritual nature of an after-work drink is both what makes it so comforting -- and potentially dangerous.CommentsJim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027It\u0027s time to be honest about the deep-seated sense of race in the heart of our national politics. But when people of color speak the truth about the realities of race in our culture and politics, they are always accused of \"playing the race card.\"Comments (18)Laura Rose MontorioGuest relations, Eastern Standard restaurantGrowing up in northern New Jersey with New Yorkers for parents meant that, when it came to baseball, I could root for the Yankees or I could keep quiet.CommentsDavid BrockFounder, Media Matters for AmericaThe Benghazi Hoax is the product of hyper-partisan zeal on Capitol Hill -- familiar enough -- mixed with a new and virulent strain of Tea Party-tinged Benghazi Trutherism in the conservative grassroots. \"Benghazi, you let them die,\" a heckler shouted at Clinton during a speech this week.Comments (29)Lyndsi FrandsenFounder and co-author of the blog, For All MomkindIt\u0027s our responsibility, as mothers, to do everything in our power to make sure we aren\u0027t (even unknowingly) raising mean girls.Comments (129)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureDemocrats in the White House are confronted with a dilemma. On the one hand, the clock\u0027s ticking on their temporary budget deal with the Republicans. If it runs out and there\u0027s no new agreement, we run the risk of a default and the government could shut down again.Comments (66)Dan GolemanAuthor, \u0027Focus: The Hidden Driver of Excellence\u0027Every morning I go off to a small studio behind my house to write. I try to ignore all email and phone calls until lunchtime. Then I launch into the sometimes frantic busy-ness of a tightly scheduled day. But that protected time in the morning is when I get my really productive work done.CommentsDavid PaulPresident, Fiscal Strategies GroupEven if the Arab Spring has not yet arrived in the Gulf, it is becoming apparent that the Saudi\u0027s world is changing. The Saudis and the Gulf monarchies are under increasing pressure.CommentsBob ComisWriter, farmerThe ultimate purpose of my farm, though not the whole point, is to raise animals to be slaughtered so that we can eat their meat. Though it is arguably better to treat an animal as an animal rather than a widget, in either case we are assuming that an animal does not have the same capacity for feeling as a human.Comments (27)Craig NewmarkFounder, craigslist and craigconnects.orgFolks, we are gearing up for midterm elections and that means that you should be aware of your rights. There are some real bad actors out there trying to implement laws to stop eligible people, including women, from voting.CommentsThe KitchnInspiring cooks. Nourishing homes.Have you ever wondered where baby carrots come from? These bite-sized crunchers have experienced a pretty incredible journey by the time they wind up in our lunch boxes and snack trays.Comments (14)Ellen StumboWriterMy mother and this relationship we had. So tested, yet so strong. More than anyone else, I cared about what she thought. Maybe because I knew I was so much like her. Maybe because if I saw strength in her, I knew I could be strong too.Comments (91)Ann BrenoffSenior Writer, The Huffington PostI have apparently taken my final step in comfort shoes and have entered a new realm of footwear: Orthotic-friendly shoes.Comments (17)Yuen ChanLecturer of Journalism at the Chinese University of Hong KongFor years, Hong Kong\u0027s establishment has peddled a Hong Kong dream based on enterprise and hard slog, with perhaps a lucky break along the way. That dream has now been exposed. The emperor has no clothes.CommentsLove LettersAn anthology of reflections on places the world overI believe the same things that make a great restaurant make a great city: the connection between a vision and the people that carry it out, the structures that seem to rise from the mind to the sky and the progress of those who create them. Cincinnati, you are a city of creators.Comments (24)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Conservative Republicans have lost their fight over the shutdown and debt ceiling, and they probably won\u0027t get major spending cuts in upcoming negotiations over the budget.But they\u0027re winning the big one: How the nation understands our biggest domestic problem.Comments (1,173)Dylan RatiganNew York Times Best-Selling author, entrepreneur and formerly the host of MSNBC\u0027s The Dylan Ratigan ShowRussell Brand is rising above mere criticism. He is on a journey through the fast and narrow rapids of life and seems to be showing us that being unoffendable helps illuminate the line we must run to keep the boat from flipping.CommentsKyle McCarthyCo-founder, StudentDebtCrisis.orgThe school faces a class action lawsuit from students who claim Globe fabricates job placement numbers, accreditation, and transfer opportunities to other institutions -- all while saddling unsuspecting students with student debt at the expense of American taxpayers.CommentsCharles RadcliffeChief, Global Issues Section, New York Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, United NationsType the words \"women should\" and you\u0027ll discover that the most common ways to complete the phrase are \"stay at home,\" \"be slaves\" and \"be in the kitchen.\" Now what happens when you repeat the Google search substituting \"gays\" for \"women\"?CommentsFrancesca VietorEnvironment, Public Policy, and Civic Engagement Program Director, The San Francisco Foundation, and Member of The San Francisco Public Utilities CommissionGet this: If food waste was a country, it would be ranked number three in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.
