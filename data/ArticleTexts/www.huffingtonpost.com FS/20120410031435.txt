{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, National Iranian American CouncilIf President Barack Obama and Iran\u0027s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei do not compromise at the upcoming nuclear talks next Saturday, the region will -- in the words of a diplomat involved in the matter -- head towards \"total war.\" For the sake of world peace, both sides must compromise. Yet, there are some indications that the next round of talks may differ little from previous failed discussions. Driven by limited political maneuverability at home, domestic pressure not to compromise, and a perception of strength that lures the parties to believe they can force on the other a fait accompli, the talks have often been about imposing terms of capitulation on the other.

Combine this fact with the design thinking of Dieter Rams, \"Good design is as little design as possible...\" and it\u0027s easy to see why we ended up asking ourselves, how do we do more, with less?Read Post | Comments (6)Cara Santa Maria, 04/06/12Science correspondent, Huffington Post; editor, Talk Nerdy to MeWhat actually happens to the body when it catches fire, and what technological advances in burn treatment await on the horizon?Read Post | Comments (310)Bill Moyers and Michael Winship, 04/09/12After months of haggling and debate, Congress finally passes reform legislation to fix a serious rupture in the body politic, and the president signs it into law. But the fight\u0027s just begun, because the special interests immediately set out to win back what they lost when the reform became law.Read Post | Comments (92)Vicki Larson, 04/09/12Journalist, mother, thinkerPerhaps Eckhart Tolle said it best: \"When you lose touch with yourself, you lose yourself in the world.\" And when it comes to losing touch with themselves, women seem to do that best, especially when it comes to relationships.Read Post | Comments (332)Becky Bond, 04/09/12Political Director, CREDO MobilePresident Obama needs to give the Department of Justice task force the resources required to launch a serious investigation that will bring about real accountability before the statutes of limitations run out for Wall Street\u0027s crimes.Read Post | Comments (30)David Katz, M.D., 04/09/12Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterThe best possible start in life is every baby\u0027s birthright.

Is the Occupy movement poised for a comeback? Or is it about to be co-opted altogether? Can both, in fact, happen simultaneously, and would that be a good thing or not?Read Post | CommentsMichael Roth, 04/08/12President, Wesleyan UniversityThe thousands of students traveling with their families across the country this month will go to classes and athletic contests, musical performances and parties.

In particular, I am struck by the author\u0027s musing that a student might die one day as a result of hazing. His sentiment gave me pause. Because I was very nearly that death.Read Post | Comments (66)Alex McCord, 04/09/12Author, Mom, TV PersonalityMy new show, Coffee Shop Confessions, debuted last week on Café Mom Studios, and it was refreshing to shoot with a group of women intent on cracking each other up, versus stabbing each other in the back.Read Post | CommentsAbby Huntsman, 04/09/12Political ContributorFor instance, yesterday I found that when you type \"Romney\" as a search term on Google, one of the first auto-complete suggestions is \"Romney attacking President.\" Could a consistently negative tone be part of his messaging problem?Read Post | Comments (57)Jennifer Chrisler, 04/09/12Executive Director, Family Equality CouncilThey are the first full generation of children reared by openly LGBT parents, and they are now reaching young adulthood.

They have not made it to the top of the political ladder because of their grand visions of the future. They got their positions by appealing to powerful political actors.Read Post | Comments (15)Robert Kuttner, 04/08/12Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Given the Republican strategy of take-no-prisoners, the only bipartisanship is capitulation. It\u0027s hard to tack back and forth between leadership and appeasement without looking like a captain who\u0027s not sure where he\u0027s taking the ship. More leadership, please.Read Post | Comments (276)Mohamed A. El-Erian, 04/08/12CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOAugusta will find a way to put the current controversy behind it -- and hopefully do so by changing an inappropriate rule.

What presidential candidate is mindful of ordinary folk? They\u0027re all millionaires.
