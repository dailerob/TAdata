{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonLONDON -- This week began with the continuing fallout from the killing spree at UCSB. Richard Martinez, whose son was among the victims, blamed \"craven, irresponsible politicians and the NRA.\" Echoing that outrage, and the senselessness that lets it continue, the Onion nailed it: \"\u0027No Way to Prevent This,\u0027 Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens.\" On Wednesday, Maya Angelou passed away, and the world mourned the poet, teacher and thinker who inspired us to look within, reach out and celebrate our common humanity. In in-house news, I was in London, where I found the mindfulness revolution in full swing. As Headspace founder Andy Puddicombe put it, \"Ten years ago when I left the monastery I wouldn\u0027t have thought I could have a conversation on mindfulness in the pub, let alone with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.\" As the new week begins, we can let Maya continue to guide us: \"Try to be a rainbow in someone\u0027s cloud.\"The main message coming from my book, Capital in the Twenty-first Century, is not that there should always be a deterministic trend toward ever rising inequality; it\u0027s that we need more democratic transparency about wealth dynamics.Thomas PikettyAuthor, \u0027Capital in the Twenty-First Century\u0027Today marks the passing of Maya Angelou, whose passionate and timeless voice for empathy, passion and humanity touched millions. Throughout her life, Dr. Angelou eloquently presented a powerful and unique expression of what we can become and what we must leave behind.Al GoreChairman, Generation Investment Management and The Climate Reality ProjectWhenever I see a photo of Elliot Rodger\u0027s blank face, shivers flow up my spine. It is a startling reminder of what could have been. But it\u0027s a reminder to keep fighting, too.Mandy VelezAssociate Editor, HuffPost Parents\"The English are not very spiritual people,\" goes the quote, often attributed to George Bernard Shaw, \"so they invented cricket to give them some idea of eternity.\" Having arrived in London for the UK publication of Thrive, I can happily say that, when it comes to matters of the soul, the British have evolved quite a bit since Shaw\u0027s quip.Arianna HuffingtonMy heart goes out to all those grievously impacted by this rampage, the latest in an unnerving series of horrific events. It is, sadly, only a matter of time before the next potentially avoidable tragedy. That means we need our heads and our will, not only our hearts, to do more right now.Lloyd I. Sederer, MDMedical director, New York State Office of Mental HealthThe next few times someone hits you, you feel like maybe you\u0027re both in the wrong. Sure, he\u0027s wrong to take his anger out on you physically, but maybe you were wrong to be tired at 3:00 in the morning when he felt like talking about his mother.Carol HartsellSenior Comedy Editor, The Huffington PostDiet-Soda sales are in free fall. The beverage industry sees the writing on the wall. It\u0027s not hard to find a credible-sounding research institution that\u0027s short on funding. That\u0027s most of them.Laurie DavidStephanie SoechtigIf you are an American human being today, you probably labor under the illusion of having a self, as Rust Cohle put it, but what you really are is a sadly predictable agglomeration of demographic traits and buying habits.Mark GongloffChief financial writer, The Huffington PostWe can\u0027t possibly jail or hospitalize everyone who has violent fantasies. The best we can hope for is to reduce access to weapons of mass destruction. It shouldn\u0027t be easier for a potential killer to get a gun than get an outpatient appointment. We need to improve both sides of this equation. More treatment, fewer guns.Allen FrancesProfessor Emeritus, Duke UniversitySomeday, maybe 12 years from now, they think, all children will be college-ready, even if they live in squalor or have no home, even if they attend overcrowded classes with inexperienced teachers. Are they gullible? Or do they believe the public can be easily deceived?Diane RavitchResearch Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027Getting to gay has not been easy. Everyone that knows accepts who I am, but I still struggle. Everyone around me believes everything is going to be fine. Why can\u0027t I?Henry VBlogger at Stumblingoutofthecloset.comI see the ACA\u0027s positive impact first-hand in my home state, a place whose collective poor health has long been jeopardizing the lives and financial security of hard-working families who can\u0027t seem to get ahead.Gov. Steve BeshearGovernor of KentuckyHers was a life born of nothingness, of vicious sexual assault, of shattered boulevards and smashed glass windows. But from the muck of that life, Maya Angelou became a voice for girls, for women, and even for boys like me.Kevin PowellPublic speaker and activist; author, \u0027Barack Obama, Ronald Reagan, and the Ghost of Dr. King: Blogs and Essays\u0027There will be bad bosses -- male and female. There will also be good bosses -- male and female. College graduates considering choosing a boss based on perception only serves to reinforce certain stereotypes.Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarTo know that there is finally a light at the end of the tunnel, and it\u0027s not an oncoming train -- it becomes a refilling of hope, a refilling of belief in our justice system.Raymond SantanaYusef SalaamCrossFit seems to think that the more pain you are in, whether on that day or the days following the workout, the better. The more you disregard the pain and keep pushing through it, the \"tougher\" you are. But this is not true, and more importantly, it\u0027s not healthy.Erin SimmonsFormer athlete, coach, health and fitness promoterHow many of the 43 multiple shootings ended with a \"good guy\" pulling out a gun? None.Mike WeisserMike the Gun GuyPope Francis has shown us a faithful, peaceful approach to the Palestinian/Israeli conflict. All of us can follow his example. We are all Pope Francis now. It is up to all of us.Paul Brandeis RaushenbushExecutive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostWe are citizens of a country that does not yet exist, but it is up to us to finally create and make it a just and hopeful land for all.Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundGoogle just revealed that 17 percent of its technology staff is female. That is impressive compared with the rest of Silicon Valley, but not once you put it in the context of the available pool of female computer scientists.Vivek WadhwaAcademic, Researcher, Writer, EntrepreneurOur veterans should not continue to suffer pointlessly. Republicans need to do more than wave an American flag. Rather, they need to work with my Democratic colleagues to pass legislation that provides the VA with the funds it needs.Rep. Charles RangelRepresentative from the 13th Congressional District in New YorkSomething is fundamentally broken, and we need radical changes in order to fix it. We need to put the fear of prison time into the heads of top executives before they make the decision to put profits over people.Ian ReifowitzAuthor of \u0027Obama’s America: A Transformative Vision of Our National Identity\u0027Wear slippers when you have to drive in heels. Wear slippers when you\u0027re traveling. Wear slippers at all moments that it\u0027s even slightly acceptable to wear slippers.Lexi HerrickWriter, Marketing Co-op, and College Student.At Republican campaign committee headquarters, Champagne bottles surely were popped in celebration. The Republican strategy of obstructing any measure that would put people back to work is succeeding.Robert L. BorosagePresident, Institute for America\u0027s FutureFine, here\u0027s what happened to Andy\u0027s dad.Jon NegroniAuthor of The Pixar Theory and other online essaysMay this disaster -- in which the fury of the gods seems to have taken up where human fury left off -- at least serve to cast Bosnia\u0027s plight in sharp relief. May it remind each and every one of us of the duty to remember and repair that is our most fitting response to the outrage of 20 years ago.Bernard-Henri LévyBernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.The assault on nature is mostly from multi-national companies that regularly bribe government officials. Irreparable damage has occurred to priceless rainforests and millions of people are suffering.Dr. Reese HalterBroadcaster, Conservation Biologist, EducatorJohn KinnearAuthor of AskYourDadBlog.comIce cream is one of the few foods with the power to delight everyone.ThrillistEverything worth caring about in food, drink, and travelGiven all the heroes and soldiers he played over his half century in film, this year, it\u0027s only fitting that John Wayne\u0027s birthday falls on Memorial Day.John FarrEditor, bestmoviesbyfarr.comGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"EPA TO PROPOSE 30% CUT IN CARBON EMISSIONS",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
