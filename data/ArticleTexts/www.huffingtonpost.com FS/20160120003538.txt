Michigan\u0027s state environmental agency kept insisting the water was safe, but anyone with a sense of sight, smell and taste knew that the state\u0027s bureaucrats were wrong. But it is not simply the state agency or the governor who should accept blame, but the federal EPA and President Obama as well. Hillary Clinton\u0027s and Bernie Sanders\u0027s efforts to make this a partisan issue is cynical presidential primary political pandering. This is a bipartisan mess-up. The failure in Flint belongs to all of us and it should lead to some hard thinking about the causes of this completely avoidable environmental disaster.Many low-income women and girls share a similar struggle -- especially those who are experiencing homelessness. Inability to afford tampons or pads or to access hygiene facilities, can severely compromise women\u0027s health, productivity and dignity.Attorney, advocate and activistPhotographerOutside of the strange and insular world of extreme right-wing politics, most folks generally recognize the hazards of climate change: deadly heat waves, droughts, more frequent and more severe cyclones, floods, wildfires, catastrophic loss of marine life, and shifts in agricultural productivity.Scientist and former White House Senior Policy Analyst; Ph.D. in marine biology/neurophysiologyI began to get \"the gun thing,\" as I\u0027d dismissively termed it. A few who wrote to me pointed out that when you live in a rural community and calling law enforcement does not necessarily result in a prompt response, owning a gun for personal safety seems prudent.Mother, journalist and blogger at caramcduna.comHillary knows that the disastrous legislation, the Commodity Futures Modernization Act (CFMA), had nothing to do with Sanders and everything to do with then-President Bill Clinton, who devoted his presidency to sucking up to Wall Street. Clinton signed this bill into law as a lame-duck president, ensuring his wife would have massive Wall Street contributions for her Senate run.Editor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027They Know Everything About You\u0027Once the decision had been made to support her, trying to figure out if she was transgender or gender non-conforming didn\u0027t weigh as heavily. We were fueled by a gut feeling that told us that supporting our depressed and anxious child could not possibly be a wrong decision.Proud mom and loud advocate for gender awesome kidsEven as the global warming crisis makes it clear that coal, natural gas, and oil are yesterday\u0027s energy, the momentum of two centuries of fossil fuel development means new projects keep emerging in a zombie-like fashion. And it\u0027s not just pipelines, not by a long shot.Author of a dozen books, including \u0027The End of Nature\u0027 and \u0027Deep Economy\u0027Bilious as it is, Donald Trump\u0027s pledge to \"make America great again\" touches something deeper than just resentment or nostalgia -- a desire for national renewal which, at its best, could inspire a more transcendent politics, transforming widespread angst about our future into a shared and positive mission. All too often Democrats fail to transcend.Novelist and contributing opinion writerGiven her platforms, her history, her experience, and what I believe this country needs at this moment in time, I\u0027m with her. That isn\u0027t blind feminism. It\u0027s about acknowledging the historical juncture at which we find ourselves.Sass \u0026 SensibilityThe policies and overall message of the Sanders campaign will benefit all Americans, but it\u0027s easy to see how his policy proposals will benefit women.Author of American Woman: The Poll Dance, Media Director for We Are WomanThe slash in fighter pay signals the latest setback for the terror group and lends new support to U.S. claims that its strategy to disrupt ISIS\u0027 revenue stream is working.Vocativ - news sourced from the deep web.Despite the white noise campaign to discredit The Hunting Ground, there has been tremendous and unprecedented progress in new campus policies and regulations. The backlash claims that some of the campus rape date was exaggerated or simply false has been disproved over and over again.Leading Advocate for the Homeless, Victims of Domestic Violence and At-Risk YouthAdvocate, journalist and lecturerAt this moment, Europe, Japan, and a host of the U.S.\u0027s closest allies are sending trade delegations to Tehran to connect with their Iranian counterparts and snap up new business opportunities, all the while effectively reintegrating Iran with their own respective economies.Legal Fellow, National Iranian American CouncilThe New York area has 13.8 percent of all the Jews in the world, and accounts for 31 percent of all the Jews in the U.S. So when speaking of New York values that \"everyone understand\" the odds are high that \"everyone understands\" that New York is very Jewish.Author, \"Runaway Inequality: An Activist\u0027s Guide to Economic Justice\"I thought that attending college and medical school at Yale and Harvard, respectively, would be my golden ticket to America\u0027s meritocratic dream, that my prestigious diplomas would shield me from future experiences with racism and bigotry.Third-year medical resident at Massachusetts General HospitalSitting in my psychology class at the University of California Berkeley, I felt my hands clam up and my body tense as my professor initiated a conversation about the White Student Unions that have recently popped up on Facebook over the past few months.UC Berkeley Student, Huffington Post BloggerIt really is possible to be around food at a restaurant, on vacation, at a party, and not be afraid that you\u0027ll over-indulge and spiral out of control. It\u0027s possible to keep any food you like in your house and not have to worry about not fitting into your pants anymore.I coach women who “have it together” in their lives, but are frustrated with their eating.The movie The Big Short tells a compelling version of the greatest economic tragedy to hit the country since the Great Depression -- the 2008 financial crash. It also may tell a nightmarish vision of the future.President and CEO, Better Markets, Inc.If you had asked me whether sex was an important part of the equation several years ago, I would have brushed you off with a quick \"sure.\" There would have been a myriad of excuses as to why it wasn\u0027t something I invested energy into. As Sweet Brown so succinctly put it, \"Ain\u0027t nobody got time for that.\"Founder, downtothere.comWhile Turnbull\u0027s visit may look like a relatively routine trip marking the importance of the U.S.-Australia alliance, it\u0027s merely the tip of the iceberg of a concreted American strategy to continue supporting peace and prosperity in Asia.Senior Fellow, Center for American ProgressGeorge R.R. Martin admits to using real religions as the basis for these fictional ones, and to relating each faith to the temperament of its followers. The result is a diversity of faiths that compete for influence and play a big role in Westerosi identity and politics.PhD Candidate in religion, violence, and globalizationAfter 20 years of negotiations, a solution seems to be within reach. Italy should be able to avoid further condemnation by the European Court of Human Rights, which has asked the country to legally recognize same-sex couples.Blog Editor, The Huffington Post ItalyUp until recently, I have f*cking dreaded the aging process. But I am alive. And it\u0027s going to be my birthday. I am going to eat some cake and I\u0027m going to blow out some candles. This is a plan. It\u0027s an awesome one.Co-founder, StorytegicFor those who closely follow financial markets, the first two weeks of 2016 have been the most fun since the financial crisis triggered by the collapse of the housing bubble.

Then a few seconds later, political pundits tell you who they think won. Their opinions then turn into \u0027what most people thought\u0027 when you\u0027re talking about the debate with others.Des Moines nativeLooking back at my second decade, or my #messytwenties, I see a blur of transitions, transformations, revolutions and lots of tequila shots. In a nutshell, in our 20s, we are mostly wrong -- especially because we think we are so right.Founder and CEO of The Passion CompanyUnlike her, he has a consistent record of opposing free trade, not a long series of zig-zags for political expediency.
