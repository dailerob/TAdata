{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersNext week, Pope Francis is scheduled to release \"Laudato Sii\" (\"Praised Be You\"), his eagerly anticipated encyclical (authoritative teaching document) on the environment. I have never seen such excitement -- and controversy -- surrounding an encyclical. It speaks to the extraordinary global presence Francis has achieved in a relatively short period of time. This feels to me like one of those rare moments when the Message and the Messenger can combine to change the world in a very significant way.

We need fair trade agreements that benefit workers here and around the world, protect our planet, and promote access to affordable medicines and safe food. The ongoing TPP negotiation does not meet those tests.U.S. Representative for Illinois\u0027s 9th congressional districtWhat we have come to learn about the gut microbiome in just the past five years has revolutionized our understanding of the role of the digestive tract in body physiology, health, and disease outcomes.Author of The Gut Balance RevolutionTrue or False? There was no way the Office of Personnel Management could have prevented hackers from stealing the sensitive personal information of millions of federal employees, past and present.

It is scientifically proven to have significant environmental benefits.Reigning monarch of the Principality of MonacoAs Horner explained in his 2009 book How to Build a Dinosaur: Extinction Doesn\u0027t Have to be Forever (and in his TED talk on de-extinction), you can turn on dormant genes to get them to build body parts, including a dino-like tail, snout and even teeth. Because of their availability, chickens work well, so Jack intends to build what he calls a \"Chickenosaurus.\"Founding publisher, Skeptic magazine; editor, Skeptic.comNow I have a lobster pillow and a faux-coral sculpture I don\u0027t even understand. The only reason I didn\u0027t buy a lamp is there was no room in my cart after the f*cking pillows.Feminist, body positive, wife, mom of five, Editor In Chief at ravishly.com, (sometimes) RN.I\u0027m a self-proclaimed Netflix junkie, and the more marathons I watch, the more I believe that Netflix is slowly guiding me through life\u0027s roller coaster of emotions.TV Advertising Professional. SUNY Brockport Grad. Newlywed.What are the practices that lead to deep spiritual growth? How can fasting help focus attention on what matters? What do those who observe the fast hoping to learn?

But what factors contribute to the rise of these judgments of character in the first place?Founder, GlobalGrind.comCaitlyn\u0027s coming out has started a national dialogue, but my fear is that it will start and stop there. How can you help?
