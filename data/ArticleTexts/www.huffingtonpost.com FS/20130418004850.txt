{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonBREAKING! This just in: the economy is terrible and the country is suffering its worst jobs crisis since the Depression... developing... Of course, this isn\u0027t actually breaking news, it\u0027s aching news -- and before the tragic bombings in Boston, the most important story going on. But you wouldn\u0027t have known that if you\u0027d been listening to the media, where the long-term jobs disaster that\u0027s been enveloping the country for five years goes virtually unmentioned. Only 88,000 new jobs were produced last month. And for the long-term unemployed, the situation is verging on hopeless. It\u0027s hard to imagine our jobs disaster will get the attention -- and the solutions -- it deserves if our media doesn\u0027t think it\u0027s a story worth telling. Perhaps we need to come up with an alternate term to the breathless \"BREAKING\" tag. How about \"BROKEN\"?Comments (543)Burton NewmanAttorney; Adjunct professor, Washington University School of LawFor well over two centuries the Supreme Court never decided that the Amendment granted a constitutional right to individuals to bear arms. The widely held notion that such a right existed was a myth fabricated by the NRA for its own self interest and for the corporate profits of gun manufacturers.Comments (375)Hannah Kathryn DeYoungSophomore, Northeastern UniversityAt first I just felt the impact go through my body. Runners ducked and asked \"What was that?\" as they swiveled towards the finish line. A pillar of smoke stretched into the air, but with hundreds of runners between me and the explosion I could not see who it had impacted.Comments (25)Michael ShawPublisher of BagNewsNotes, topping LIFE.com\u0027s 2011 Best Photo BlogsWhat takes me aback are how graphic the news photos are as compared to the almost total visual censorship of American war casualties over the past twelve years.Comments (178)Robert CreamerPolitical Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersConventional wisdom continues to hold that, while the vast majority of Americans support universal background checks, in many areas it is still smart politics not to antagonize the NRA and their relatively small number of very passionate -- supporters. Conventional wisdom is wrong.CommentsRobert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027We come together as Americans when confronting common disasters and common threats, but we continue to split apart economically. Almost 1 out of 4 of the nation\u0027s children is in now in poverty, but you wouldn\u0027t know that in Washington.Comments (183)Frank MannionAward-winning Irish movie producer and distributorLooking back now, it could be argued that the Thatcher period was the golden age of British film.Comments (19)Angelina ChapinBlogs Editor, Huffington Post CanadaIn the mad dash for readers\u0027 eyeballs, the media often chooses fast over factual. But who are publications serving by being the first to cross an invisible finish line?CommentsDean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027The high pay for those at the top does not come out of the air; it comes from everyone else\u0027s paycheck. There is no single policy that would reverse this enormous upward redistribution of income, but reining in CEO pay has to be an important part of the story.Comments (18)Dan FroomkinContributing editor, Nieman ReportsIt\u0027s not just Bush and Cheney who violated international law; now it\u0027s Obama, too. The report is blistering about the cover-up. The end result is a society in moral disarray.Comments (193)Claire McCarthy, M.D.Pediatrician, Boston Children\u0027s Hospital, Harvard Medical SchoolI found out about them from my daughter, who was running away from the scene. She was right there, close enough to see the explosions, just yards away.Comments (71)Spencer OvertonProfessor of Law at The George Washington University Law School; Senior Fellow at DemosNow comes word that on Monday night, Scalia told a group of students that the provision is an \"embedded\" form of \"racial preferment.\" Even aside from improperly commenting on a pending case, Scalia is wrong.CommentsDaniel L. DoctoroffCEO and President of Bloomberg L.P.In the post-Dodd-Frank world, transparency should not be thwarted, access to immediately free market data should not be reduced, and retail investors should not have less protections.CommentsJeffrey YoungHuffington Post Health Care ReporterMore than three years after President Barack Obama signed his health care reform law and just months before people can start signing up for benefits, his administration will roll out a massive consumer outreach campaign.CommentsMarc H. MorialPresident and CEO, National Urban LeagueWhile this legislation is hardly a final answer, it is at least a first step and would demonstrate that our leaders have the backbone to stand up for the American people in the face of opposition and threats from a well-funded and obstinate gun lobby.CommentsMichael WolkowitzCo-Founder Faiths United to Prevent Gun Violence; Former Chair, The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun ViolenceThe leadership of the NRA is exceptionally fond of the Slippery Slope argument. Problem number one with this slide down the fearsome slope is how much weaponry has changed since the days of militias with muskets.Comments (195)Jonah BergerAuthor, \u0027Contagious: Why Things Catch On\u0027Generating word of mouth or getting something to go viral sometimes seems like magic. Like catching lightning in a bottle. But it\u0027s not. By understanding the science behind social influence you can make your own products and ideas contagious.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorI just read that Goldman Sachs posted a profit of $2.2 billion in the first quarter, \"... driven by strength in its investment banking business as well as its investing and lending unit.\" And they\u0027re mere pikers compared to their banking brethren.Comments (97)Brian Levin, J.D.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityWhile there is significant speculation about the meaning of the date and location of yesterday\u0027s horrific terror attack at the Boston marathon that killed 3 and injured over 170, physical evidence will yield some of the most important clues. One of the most important clues is a bomb\u0027s signature.Comments (88)Imogen Lloyd WebberAuthor and BroadcasterWould I be the person I am today without Thatcher? Would I have worked as hard as I did at school, not flinch when debating a roomful of men -- or a Fox News host live on air -- without \"The Iron Lady\" as an example? I doubt it.Comments (24)Jamie Lee CurtisActress and children\u0027s book authorApril 15 now so sadly known for both. One a privilege for living in a free county, the other perhaps a price.Comments (120)MJ RosenbergSpecial Correspondent, Washington SpectatorThe intent of this resolution is to eliminate any Israeli hesitancy about getting into a war it cannot win. Israelis won\u0027t do that. Menendez, Graham and company are telling them not to worry. Just do it, and we are in too.Comments (288)Kate GrantCEO, Fistula FoundationNot every woman is lucky enough to give birth in a modern delivery room, like I was. But no woman, anywhere, should have to suffer a life of misery and isolation simply for trying to bring a child into this world.CommentsJeff DanzigerPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideComments (149)Richard FloridaDirector, Martin Prosperity Institute, University of Toronto, Rotman School of Management; Global Research Professor, NYU; Editor-at-Large, Atlantic CitiesToronto\u0027s business leaders like to think that they are helping to build a great global city, but casino building is city-ruining of the highest order. A downtown casino will tear holes in Toronto\u0027s urban fabric, create more costs than benefits, and send the message that Toronto is on the wrong track.CommentsDaniel Arrigg KohChief of Staff to Arianna HuffingtonWe will never understand why anyone would want to commit such tragedy. But there\u0027s one thing that\u0027s clear -- they won\u0027t mess with our Marathon. Bostonians will never allow it. Next year, the runners will be even more determined, and the crowds will be larger. It\u0027s in our spirit -- and it\u0027s unbreakable.Comments (24)Christopher ElliottAuthor, Scammed: How to Save Your Money and Find Better Service in a World of Schemes, Swindles and Shady DealsThe government encourages \"random and unpredictable\" airport security, which means that it\u0027s in the TSA\u0027s best interests to have one airport that passengers actually like and another that\u0027s universally hated.CommentsAhmed CharaiPublisher of the weekly Moroccan magazine \u0027L\u0027Observateur\u0027For us in Morocco and for so many other societies, the Boston Marathon in particular highlights one of the many qualities that attract us to America: It is a magnet for international excellence. Though a city of hills, it is at the same time a level playing field for robust competition among athletes from every continent.CommentsJen KirkmanStand-up Comedian, writerIf I had a baby, surely my hormones would kick in, I\u0027d become really Zen like the Red Sox and my life would be devoted to our kid. But somewhere deep down, I knew that being a mother wasn\u0027t right for me.Comments (30)Levi A. MilesStudent, University of Wisconsin at MilwaukeeWhen my dad left to pick up some dinner, my mom, whom I\u0027ve been out to for almost two years, said, \"Your father saw your Facebook status when I left my Facebook up. The cat\u0027s out of the bag.\" You see, I hadn\u0027t told him.Comments (1,084)Ken SolinAuthor, \u0027Act Like a Man\u0027While having sex isn\u0027t any boomer\u0027s first rodeo, having wild monkey sex may be less familiar. What\u0027s wild monkey sex?
