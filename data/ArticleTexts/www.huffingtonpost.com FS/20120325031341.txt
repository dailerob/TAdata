{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Despite his big victory in Illinois on Tuesday, this was not a banner week for Mitt Romney. Indeed, he experienced a PR disaster when his longtime adviser Eric Fehrnstrom likened him to an Etch A Sketch: \"You can kind of shake it up and we start all over again.\" Santorum and Gingrich quickly began brandishing the toys at campaign events. Will classic toys now become a 2012 leitmotif? Will Romney whip out a Slinky when he talks about Gingrich or a Mr. Potato Head when he goes after Santorum? Will Ron Paul feel left out and challenge the others to a round of Rock \u0027Em Sock \u0027Em Robots? Will voters forget about debates and use a Magic 8-Ball to determine who to vote for? One thing\u0027s for sure: No one who has been paying attention to this campaign will compare any of the candidates to a Lite-Brite.Read Post | CommentsSimon Johnson, 03/19/12MIT professor; Co-author, \u002713 Bankers\u0027 and \u0027White House Burning\u0027; Columnist on fiscal affairsWith the so-called JOBS bill, Congress is about to abandon much of the 1930s-era securities legislation that both served investors well and helped make the U.S. one of the best places in the world to raise capital.
