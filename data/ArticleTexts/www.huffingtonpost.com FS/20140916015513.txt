{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This morning I sent an email to our HuffPost team, sharing the news of a major milestone for our company -- one that really struck a chord with me. And you, the members of the HuffPost community, are the heart and soul of this milestone. Whether you have blogged on HuffPost, commented on, shared or talked about a story or just made us a regular part of your media diet, you have been a key part of the conversation we set out to start a little over nine years ago. Indeed, without you, there would be no HuffPost. So thank you for being part of this remarkable journey -- a journey that is still very much in progress. Here is the email I sent to our team.We march because we know that climate change affects everyone, but its impacts are not equally felt: those who have contributed the least to causing the crisis are hit hardest, here and around the world.Author of a dozen books, including \u0027The End of Nature\u0027 and \u0027Deep Economy\u0027Recording Secretary, Transport Workers Union Local 100Executive Director, NYC Environmental Justice AllianceIt took President Obama a long time and multiple stumbles to back into a foreign policy role that looks something like leadership. If Russian President Putin is agreeing to a cease-fire in Ukraine that just might hold, the U.S.-led combination of pressure and restraint deserves much of the credit.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027We started this year with a frightening record: More than 51 million fellow human beings were forcibly displaced from their homes by conflict and human rights abuse.Secretary General, Norwegian Institute of International Affairs; Former Special Advisor, UN Secretary General for Conflict Prevention and Resolution (2006-2008)America has come to the breaking point. Our ability to think our way to a solution is temporarily impaired thanks to the utterly devastating annihilation of reasonable economic ideas by the neo-liberal revolution. So before we rebuild the economy, we\u0027ve got a job ahead of us to rebuild some ideas.Venture AnachronistWell, we can all relax now. Senator John McCain, who was wrong about Iraq, wrong about the surge in Iraq, wrong about the surge in Afghanistan, wrong about Libya, and wrong about most everything else pertaining to US security, has \"vetted\" the Syrian rebels he now wants to send arms to.Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranI do not assume that my personal life choices are so fundamental that other people are less human or will live less fulfilled lives because they don\u0027t make the same ones.Author of \"American Monsters\"Most of us don\u0027t even know what a gram of apple or an ounce of milk looks like, so how can we possibly calculate a sensible portion? Well, perhaps arithmetic is not required, and it may even be misleading.Author, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027The War did more than any propagandist could possibly do to radicalize vulnerable young people. And by setting off wave after wave of sectarian slaughter it created blood feuds that will never be forgiven. And now many of the same people who caused this foreign policy disaster have the audacity to criticize President Obama\u0027s measured efforts to clean up the mess they created.Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersThere\u0027s no debating that a fruit and veg-packed smoothie first thing in the a.m. is a gal\u0027s best friend. Loaded with filling fiber, plant-powered protein, and vitamins out the wazoo, smoothies are a totally foolproof way to give your breakfast a major nutrient boost.Registered dietitian, hummusapien.comTens of millions of people had been living with the fear that if they lost their jobs, they would also lose their health insurance. This would be a big deal for most families but especially those in which one or more family members had a serious health condition. Insurers do not like to insure sick people. The ACA changed that.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027While this data unquestionably increases the efficiency of the economy in numerous ways, what is in question is whether consumers are ultimately benefitting significantly from those productivity gains or whether that surplus is being largely captured by these \"big data platforms.\"Director, MORE NYCCorporate science is, above all else, secretive. The flimsy excuse of \"trade secrets\" is used to prevent independent or academic scientists from evaluating exaggerated corporate claims.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorClimate change threatens to undermine the United Nations\u0027 progress in both of its critical missions -- peacekeeping and development: Hardship often leads to conflict, and the worsening impacts of climate change are causing hardship.President and CEO, the United Nations FoundationEmulation is the highest form of flattery -- or so it is claimed. The truth of that assertion, though, depends on what form the emulation takes and, indeed, how the initial action originally was construed. Recent events in the Middle East underscore both the radiating influence of the United States as a model and the often perverse effects that can lead to.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghA majority of Americans think global warming is real and that human activity\u0027s a factor, believing in the science behind reports on climate change. But some two-thirds of white evangelical Christians aren\u0027t convinced.Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyThe War of 1812 didn\u0027t gain America much, as a country. It didn\u0027t address the complaints that led the Americans to declare war in the first place. We didn\u0027t conquer Canada. But we did gain a certain amount of what can be called our \"national identity\" after the war. Right at the heart of this was a new patriotic (and popular) song.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comMore and more, women know that this midterm election matters in their lives, whether it\u0027s responding forcefully to unconscionable domestic violence or finally eliminating the inequality of paying women less than men.Executive Director, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC)We need to learn from Ferguson so that we will be prepared for the Fergusons of the future. We can prepare ourselves and our communities to respond to violence without letting it overtake us. We can fight evil without becoming evil. We can find the third way that is neither fight nor flight.Activist and bestselling author, \u0027The Irresistible Revolution\u0027Unlike my client, perhaps you\u0027re aware coffee drinks can become sugar bombs, but even the most health-conscious among us struggle to know everywhere sugar hides and how to avoid those things. It can feel incredibly daunting.Fitness/Nutrition Expert, Author of NY Times Bestseller The Virgin Diet.Even if we ignore black women\u0027s grinding poverty, the sky-high rates of HIV infection, and the disproportionate incarceration, the fact is nearly half of all black women have been sexually coerced by the age of 18.Associate professor and associate chair of the African and African Diaspora Studies Department at The University of Texas at AustinHaving seen the impact of easier handgun access on gun homicide rates, the legislature in its wisdom now believes that it will move the gospel of \"good guys with guns protecting us from bad guys with guns\" into the schools.Mike the Gun GuyThis workout routine helped to keep me energized throughout the day, strengthened and toned my legs and made me feel much better about myself when I got back to town. It also curbed my cravings and helped me make better food choices.Fitness Contributing Editor for Shape Magazine, Corporate Wellness Director and Fitness Nutrition SpecialistSenate Republicans voted unanimously last week for elections that are competitions of cash, with candidates who amass the most money empowered to shout down opponents. The GOP rejected elections that are contests of ideas won by candidates offering the best concepts.International President, United SteelworkersWe would do well to remember the lessons that the 1991 Christopher Commission drew from its investigation into the police practices that led to Rodney King\u0027s beating at the hands of the LAPD and the riots that followed.Arnold I. Shure Professor of Law, University of ChicagoIn recent years, the world has seen enormous human rights gains with respect to sexual orientation and gender identity and expression. However, there have also been substantial setbacks.Bangkok-based journalistYeah, I know it\u0027s hard. I know your hands are bleeding from cutting carrots into little flowers. I know your eyes hurt from placing nori leaf eyes on those chicken nuggets. Suck it up.Reductress.com, the one and only fake women\u0027s news magazineThe Apple Watch introduces the concept of wearing a watch to many of Apple\u0027s 18 to 35 target market. If it takes off, it is likely that these buyers will eventually consider purchasing other types of watches for events later in life.Assistant professor of business administration at Harvard Business SchoolWithout fundamental public health infrastructures in place, no country is stable, no society is secure, no resilience exists to withstand the shocks that our 21st-century world is delivering with ever-greater frequency and force.Brilliantly acted by Michael Cera as Warren, Kieran Culkin as Dennis, and Tavi Gevinson, as Jessica Goldman, the object of Warren\u0027s fantasies, and flawlessly directed by Anna D. Shapiro, Lonergan\u0027s wonderfully crafted 1996 play captures all the agony and the ecstasy, but mostly the agony, of post-pubescent youth.Author, theater criticIt\u0027s the occasional princess sticker stuck on my high heel shoes or the temporary tattoo on my arm that I don\u0027t notice until halfway through the work day. I am constantly reminded throughout my day that I am a mom first and my work takes a clear second place.Writer. Blogger.
