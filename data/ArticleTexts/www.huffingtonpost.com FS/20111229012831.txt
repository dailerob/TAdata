{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Director, Center for the Study of the American ElectorateWhen states are enacting the wrong type of ID requirements for voting and various branches of government are implementing many different and incompatible ID systems, the time to consider a different approach is now. Too many of the ID laws that have been enacted in the states are not benign with respect to their impact on turnout -- they unequally burden those with limited resources and mobility, and they lead to partisan outcomes. The end effect of the ongoing back-and-forth we\u0027ve seen this year is to undermine citizen faith in the integrity of the electoral process as a whole, and in our democracy. It\u0027s time for a new paradigm for the conduct of American elections.Read Post | Comments (285)Peter Davis, 12/28/11Academy Award-winning filmmaker, author and journalistOn Christmas Eve 1973, Bert Schneider, the richly innovative Hollywood producer who died this month, decreed a screening of what eventually became my film on the Vietnam War, Hearts and Minds.Read Post | CommentsRobert Reich, 12/28/11Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Aftershock\u0027My political prediction for 2012 (based on absolutely no inside information): Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden swap places.

That attack is itself based on a fantasy -- that in the absence of government, human action would yield generally optimal outcomes for society as a whole.Read Post | Comments (43)Evan Shapiro, 12/28/11President, IFCIs all TV good? Of course not! A lot of TV is crap. But denigrating ALL TV as evil is like burning all books because Snooki is now a best-selling author.
