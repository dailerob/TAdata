{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, 70 people were shot -- 12 fatally -- when a gunman armed with an AR-15 assault rifle, a shotgun, and a Glock handgun opened fire in a crowded movie theater in Aurora, Colorado. As gun control advocates, including Mayor Michael Bloomberg, called for a discussion on a national problem that is literally killing us, some claimed it\u0027s too early. Actually, it\u0027s already too late for the Colorado victims -- whose names, in what has become a too-often-repeated ritual, get second (or third... or twelfth) billing to the murderer\u0027s. But it\u0027s not too late for the thousands of people who are alive today but won\u0027t be next year because of gun violence. With America\u0027s gun murder rate 20 times higher than the next 22 richest nations combined, it\u0027s a discussion that should be front and center, including in the coming presidential debates. But it won\u0027t be... unless we demand it.Read Post | Comments (599)Lisa Belkin, 07/20/12Senior columnist for life/work/family, The Huffington PostThere has been much written about how we are smothering our children, and worrying about the wrong dangers, and cocooning them in bubblewrap. And, statistically, that advice is right. But statistics don\u0027t mean a thing on days like these.Read Post | Comments (567)Gary Hart, 07/21/12President, Hart International, Ltd.Much of our life is dedicated to an attempt to understand through reason -- rational, logical thought -- our existence. But when one human kills a dozen or more other humans who represent no threat to him, nothing seems to make sense, nothing is reasonable or rational.Read Post | Comments (249)Charles Ferguson, 07/16/12Director of the Wall Street documentary \u0027Inside Job\u0027; Author of \u0027Predator Nation\u0027Over the past two decades, the financial services industry has become a pervasively unethical and highly criminal industry, with massive fraud tolerated or even encouraged by senior management. But how did that happen?Read Post | Comments (784)Arianna Huffington, 07/16/12Barack Obama\u0027s campaign has given us all a crash course on the ills of Bain, but hasn\u0027t given us an alternative narrative of the kind of capitalism that should define the nation as we emerge from the financial crisis -- if, in fact, we ever do.Read Post | Comments (624)Geoffrey R. Stone, 07/20/12Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoThis is the time for politics, before we do what we always do after such massacres -- shed some tears, express our grief, say a few prayers, and then quickly go on to do what the gun lobby wants us to do: change the subject.Read Post | Comments (3,353)Marian Wright Edelman, 07/20/12President, Children\u0027s Defense FundEvery time a child is excluded from school by adults or is chronically absent without any actions to determine why, we are failing the child and undercutting the importance of education. Hundreds of years after Americans first made that connection, what will it take for us to get it again today?Read Post | Comments (329)Steven Van Zandt, 07/21/12Record producer, songwriter, and musicianIt is obvious by now that everyone regrets the plug being pulled prematurely last Saturday night. I want to officially apologize for blaming the police. We all know and should appreciate the tough job they do day after day.Read Post | Comments (105)Marlo Thomas, 07/12/12Award-winning actress, author, and activistChoosing a running mate is by turns highly secretive and very public, and it has produced some great future leaders of the country.

There are after-school classes, team sports, camps, lessons. What\u0027s often missing from the schedule is valuable time spent alone.Read Post | Comments (184)Paul Brandeis Raushenbush, 07/20/12Senior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostIf we respond too soon we do not honor those victims who have died, and those who continue to suffer. Instead, our reactions serve the idols of our own agendas and ideas.Read Post | Comments (226)Chris Kelly, 07/20/12Writer, \u0027Real Time with Bill Maher\u0027Twelve people were killed last night, apparently, by a rifle and a handgun and the faulty wiring inside the head of a man named James Holmes.

From the day I became a naturalized US citizen, I have been as much an American as anyone. It is depressingly disconcerting, therefore, to hear the cacophony of voices accusing the President of the United States of not being \"American,\" of being somehow foreign.Read Post | Comments (746)Greta Van Susteren, 07/18/12Host of Fox News\u0027 \u0027On the Record with Greta Van Susteren\u0027Solutions and plans will only come if and when the two parties in the Senate begin to talk to each other.
