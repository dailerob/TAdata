{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editorial Director, AOL Huffington Post Media GroupIs this a great country or what? Not because the Court upheld the overall scheme of the president\u0027s health care law. That is an ordinary question, no matter how much money was at stake. It is a great country because the workings of our carefully wrought system of government are not predicated on punditry, predictions or polls. Defying the expectations, Justice John Roberts joined the court\u0027s liberal wing in saving the law by grounding the individual mandate not in the power of Congress to regulate commerce, but in its taxing power. As I suggested yesterday, the court essentially said that Congress could not require people to buy something in the private economy, but they could fine them if they didn\u0027t.
