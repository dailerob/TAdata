{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonI\u0027m delighted that the release of my new book Thrive will include an opportunity to make a difference in the lives of children across the country. As part of the book\u0027s rollout, we\u0027re partnering with DonorsChoose -- an amazing organization that Fast Company this week called one of the most innovative companies of 2014 -- so that readers who pre-order the book before the March 25 publication date will get a DonorsChoose gift card equal to the book\u0027s list price of $26 (even if they paid a discounted price, or $10.99 for the Kindle version). This will be my personal donation. I\u0027ve been following and championing DonorsChoose for years, and the book\u0027s release is an opportunity for me to pay it forward and further support their good work.CommentsJordan PriceDesigner, artist, and father living in San FranciscoAll I know is that I wanted to work at Apple really bad -- and now not so much. Today at lunch time I wiped the iPad data clean, put the files I had been working on neatly on the server, left all their belongings on my desk, and I got in my car and drove home.Comments (386)Michael CohenAdvice ExpertI\u0027m not okay with Valentine\u0027s Day. I\u0027m not going to pretend I am. It\u0027s not because I\u0027m single. I didn\u0027t even like it when I was in a relationship with a guy that sent me not one, but two-dozen malnourished red roses from 1-800-Flowers. Thanks for nothing, Groupon.Comments (32)Brian BoitanoOlympic figure skating championThe International Olympic Committee will never again select a host country that is not tolerant and that does not support human rights, and that in itself is a next step.CommentsJanice BensonLives and works in New Madrid, MOSome days I am so weary I could sit and cry, if I didn\u0027t have so much to do. Entire networks and politicians make careers out of demonizing women like me as takers. Meanwhile, I just pray and work.Comments (122)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorSo, when an arsonist doesn\u0027t burn down the House [sic] do you praise him for self-restraint or just go about your business because, you know, you\u0027re not supposed to burn things down?Comments (49)Mitchell BardWriterI\u0027m tired of hearing about a battle for the Republican Party between mainstream business interests and the Tea Party. The battle is over and the Tea Party has won, at least in Congress.CommentsDean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Since we have a Congress that is unwilling to take the steps to increase demand in the labor market, the best way we may have of increasing job openings is by reducing supply.Comments (161)Katie GoodmanAward-winning comic, actress, author, creative coach, and social activist; KatieGoodman.comCommentsNikky FinneyPoetRight here, right now, let\u0027s practice your hateso we get it out of the way, so he can go onand have his brilliant career.CommentsMike LuxCo-Founder, Democracy PartnersThis is a great day for low-wage workers in America.

Author, Otherhood, March 4, 2014,This is what I know for sure: Love is still ahead of me and I won\u0027t settle for anything less. And if I\u0027m lucky, neither will he.CommentsRob BrooksEvolutionary biologist and authorDarwin\u0027s impact on the world far transcends science. And yet, I\u0027d be disappointed if this celebration of all things Darwinian began and ended with the great naturalist.Comments (52)Joelle SteinigerCo-founder of Small HQ and writing \u0027How to Build a Rocketship\u0027Even though I\u0027d \"work\" all day I wasn\u0027t working smart. I fell into the habits that most work-from-home-ers can relate to: I\u0027d start my day, still in my pajamas... and sometimes that\u0027s how I\u0027d end my day (don\u0027t judge me).CommentsMark GongloffChief financial writer, The Huffington PostBelieve it or not, 99 percenters, the 1 percent feels your pain: It suffers from inequality, too. An extremely comfortable inequality. But still, inequality.Comments (590)Dan LyonsMarketing fellow at HubSpot and creator of \u0027The Secret Diary of Steve Jobs\u0027Nobody stays on top. Before Microsoft\u0027s reign of terror, IBM held an even stronger choke-hold on tech customers. Sony was once a powerhouse. So were Digital Equipment Corp. and Sun Microsystems. Things change. New technologies come along. That\u0027s a lesson in that for Apple and its fans.CommentsMark DannerAuthor, \u0027Torture and the Forever War\u0027For all his experience and sophistication, that grimly blank expression -- calmly unflinching gaze, slightly lopsided frown -- embodied a philosophy of power unapologetically, brutally simple: attack, crush enemies; cause others to fear, submit. Power from time to time must be embodied in vivid violence, like Voltaire\u0027s executions, pour encourager les autres.Comments (100)Josh StearnsPress Freedom Campaign Director at Free PressAfter a year of attacks on whistleblowers and digital journalists and revelations about mass surveillance, the United States plunged 13 spots in the group\u0027s global press freedom rankings to number 46.Comments (64)Lindsay SchauerWriter based in San FranciscoIn 2009 I moved into a 200-square-foot cottage. The rent and location were awesome, but there was one problem. Half my stuff didn\u0027t fit in the place. So I got rid of it. Furniture, old clothes, books, shoes, art. And you know what? I haven\u0027t missed any of it since.Comments (16)Erikka YancyDocumentary FilmmakerInspired by Gandhi\u0027s success with non-violence and passive resistance in India\u0027s struggles, we know that Martin Luther King Jr. became the leader of the Civil Rights Movement by encouraging passive resistance. But these were violent times, the type of violence that is hard to imagine in 2014.Comments (26)Bradford M.

Read on -- it could save you tens of thousands of dollars!CommentsTony NewmanDirector of Media Relations, Drug Policy AllianceHere are seven significant moves by President Obama and AG Holder over the last six months that have garnished them extensive praise and admiration.CommentsJenny DavisAssistant Professor of Sociology, James Madison UniversityThe kind of individualist framing inherent in shaming endeavors, though it certainly highlights the existence of deeply racist people, simultaneously hides the ways that racism is a key structural component of American culture, infiltrating its institutions, organizations, and citizens. This is detrimental to the larger antiracist project.Comments (29)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, Beyond OutrageAs the gap between America\u0027s wealthy and the middle has widened, those at the top have felt even richer by comparison. Although a rising tide would lift all boats, many of America\u0027s richest prefer a lower tide and bigger yachts.Comments (242)Sarah BarnessWriter, Artist ExtraordinaireIt was one of the most powerful moments we shared when he revealed his personal struggles with love, relationships, and fears of being \"found out.\" Now, I understood the great lengths he had gone to fool friends and family. But he couldn\u0027t have understood how much he had fooled me.CommentsStephanie DandanNomadic photographer and writer at www.infinitesatori.orgWe travel at the cost of sacrifices. We\u0027re happy living with just barely enough as long as we\u0027re on the road. This means that we have given up plenty of comforts for the sake of travel. We would rather choose a dorm bed in a cheap hostel, a couch, a hammock, a tent, or concrete floor.CommentsJordan SchultzThe Huffington Post\u0027s sports columnist, The Schultz ReportAnthony has enjoyed some wonderful individual moments in New York City, but it\u0027s done little good for the organization as a whole.Comments (11)Harley FinkelsteinChief Platform Officer of ShopifyWe launched Do Your Park, a company committed to designing car magnets that offer a funny, non-violent way to express your disapproval over the most offensive parking jobs. Best of all, these magnets can be re-used by the recipient. Park Better. Pass it on.CommentsEvelyn LauerChicago-based writer and teacher, working on a memoir about loveLove is not part of a checklist to life. But marriage is. This is a reality -- and if you deny this, then you\u0027re not watching \"Say Yes to the Dress\" or flipping through bridal magazines. I\u0027m not thrilled about this fact; it\u0027s one of the reasons I avoided marriage for so long.CommentsChez PazienzaCo-host, \u0027The Bubble Genius Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027; writer, Deus Ex MalcontentGiven that the only time anyone watches HLN is when a white, attractive woman has allegedly killed her child or boyfriend, or is on trial for it, HLN could definitely use a makeover.CommentsByron Williams, 2014.12.02Leena Suleiman, 2014.12.02Carlos Carnicero Urabayen, 2014.12.02Cedric Cogell, 2014.12.02David Burwell, 2014.12.02Chris Weigant, 2014.12.02Megan Smith, 2014.12.02Don McNay, 2014.12.02Clay Farris Naff, 2014.12.02Dina Khayal, 2014.12.02Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"DEBTORS\u0027 PRISONS IN THE USA",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
