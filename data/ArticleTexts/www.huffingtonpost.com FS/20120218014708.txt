{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"At the beginning of Fashion Week, I pondered the eternal question of how many times you can wear a dress you love before it becomes problematic. At the end of Fashion Week, my thoughts turn to one of modern life\u0027s great paradoxes: how, in our hyper-connected lives, do we disconnect from our devices and reconnect with ourselves? My decision to blog about this question today was prompted by two recent blogs, which included photos of me looking at my BlackBerry during Fashion Week shows.

Susan Russell, 2/17/12Episcopal priest and activist from Pasadena CABy vetoing the marriage equality bill passed by the state legislature, the Governor of New Jersey chose to stand for bigotry rather than equality. New Jersey deserves better. America deserves better. And Governor Christie should know better.Read Post | CommentsJoe Peyronnin, 2/17/12NYU Journalism ProfessorPerhaps former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum should take a couple aspirin and get some rest.

This is a stampede of unreason, contradicted by the facts.Read Post | Comments (257)Sami Moubayed, 2/17/12Editor-in-Chief, Forward MagazineTony Shadid will live on -- through his articles, and through the young men and women who are standing up for freedom, a cause that he so passionately believed in.Read Post | CommentsMeredith Bodgas, 2/17/12Blogger, MeritalBliss.comIt\u0027s well-known that what happens at the bachelor party stays at the bachelor party, but these other secrets grooms keep may not be as obvious.Read Post | CommentsKatie Goodman, 2/17/12Award-winning comic, actress, author, creative coach, and social activistIs this what my adult life has come to? Is Facebook really in a position to take away my car keys and TV privileges? This is like the best Firm Parenting Class for teens ever. Facebook does not get tired or annoyed and cave in, and there\u0027s no way for me to contest it. What\u0027s an anti-authority political satirist to do?Read Post | Comments (24)Marian Wright Edelman, 2/17/12President, Children\u0027s Defense FundAt one time, the Nations owned a home.

The GOP\u0027s presidential candidates are promising to join it if they get elected. We can\u0027t let them succeed.Read Post | Comments (15)Will Durst, 2/17/12Political comic, former radio talk show host, syndicated columnist, author, motivational speakerDon\u0027t mean to overreact and risk boosting everybody\u0027s blood pressure, but this might be a halfway decent time to seek out a nice safe steel bunker to hunker down in, because it\u0027s awards season and heavy metal statuettes are being tossed around like dimes at a county fair.Read Post | CommentsRobert Naiman, 2/17/12Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicySponsors of the Lieberman resolution deny that it is an \"authorization for military force,\" and in a legal, technical sense, they are absolutely correct: it is not a legal authorization for military force. But it is an attempt to enact a political authorization for military force.Read Post | Comments (20)Kyle Rabin, 2/17/12Program Director, GRACE Communications FoundationWhat originated as an industry term (fraccing or fracking) has been co-opted by opponents to hydraulic fracturing much to the industry\u0027s chagrin. Industry would love to turn back time and bury that word in a place no one will find it. But the genie is out of the bottle.Read Post | CommentsChris Weigant, 2/17/12Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comThe line between certain types of comedy and the political/media world should be brighter than ever.
