{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Queer Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostFor LGBT rights it\u0027s a watershed moment. While some GOP candidates have claimed they\u0027ll work to overturn marriage equality, that would be pretty difficult. The real threat to blocking LGBT rights is the \"religious freedom\" argument being made to prevent much-needed state and federal laws against all kinds of discrimination or to give exemptions to people like Kim Davis or the Oregon bakers. All these kinds of cases will reach the Supreme Court eventually, and with a 5-4 conservative grip it\u0027s always been a treacherous reality after Hobby Lobby. Of course, we still need federal legislation that secures rights explicitly in law in all areas for gay, bisexual and transgender people, not just court rulings, but no doubt, huge avenues are opened by changing the balance of the Supreme Court.With so much financial market volatility this year, we should look at the extent to which central banks have been the primary policymaker in many countries; and points to what they can and cannot do going forward.Chief Economic Advisor, AllianzIt\u0027s the kind of publicity every author dreams of: In the heat of the 2016 primaries, a leading candidate for president mentions your new book in a nationally-televised debate. Unfortunately, it involved a Democrat, attacking her Democratic opponent for endorsing it.Host of The Bill Press Radio ShowAgain and again, the press has depicted Obama\u0027s expected action in the wake of Scalia\u0027s death as being highly controversial or partisan, when in fact it\u0027s Republicans who are acting in erratic ways by categorically announcing they\u0027ll refuse to even consider Obama\u0027s next Supreme Court pick.Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaThe U.S. Constitution, Article 2, Section 2, Clause 2 says presidents nominate justices to the Supreme Court. It says the president SHALL and does not say MAY. This means it is not an option.Host, Fox News\u0027 \u0027On the Record With Greta Van Susteren\u0027Cease-fire deal or not, Russia and the Syrian regime have no reason to voluntarily jeopardize their recent gains. There is a critical clause in the deal that effectively gives the regime a free pass to continue the war: namely, the cease-fire will not apply to ISIS and the Nusra Front. Thus, Assad and Putin will target any opposition group they please, claiming the group is fighting alongside terrorists.Resident Senior Fellow, Atlantic Council, focusing on SyriaEditor, Atlantic Council\u0027s SyriaSourceDear Mr. President, please appoint Elizabeth Warren to the Supreme Court before the end of the week. She\u0027s earned it. She deserves it. And she\u0027ll be so, so good at it.U.S. Congressman for Florida\u0027s 9th DistrictThis whole \"having it all\" business has been grossly misinterpreted by our society at large. The purpose of all that bra burning back in the \u002760s was to give women choices. Doing all of it at the same time was never the idea.Print and radio reporter, co-host of Range PodcastToday, as we celebrate the 196th anniversary of Anthony\u0027s birth, her not-so-gentle prodding of the daughters and granddaughters of the founders provides a useful perspective on some of Secretary Clinton\u0027s problems with young female voters.Author of \u0027Sally Ride: America\u0027s First Woman in Space\u0027 and an award-winning broadcaster and authorAlmost immediately upon hearing the shocking news that Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia had unexpectedly died Saturday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would not permit the president to fill the court seat. This is a new one.Screenwriter; former member, WGAW Board of Directors; former U.S. Senate aideSo many Black and Brown lives; Black and Brown love; and Black and Brown families are in muddled in the mayhem of incarceration. Incarceration has become a family member. Incarceration is a new surname in so many families of color in the United States.Founder and chief re-imaginator of The Precedential Groupf you spend a few minutes on the NRA website, you would think that this part of the world has really changed. No matter where you look on the site, women are featured in videos about gun training, using guns, hunting with guns and, most of all, defending themselves with guns.Mike the Gun GuyEmily Ratajkowski found the Internet to be no kinder to a woman who supports Bernie Sanders than it is to a woman who supports Hillary Clinton. Online harassment is a serious issue, and it would be great if both campaigns addressed it in a productive way.Freelance writer in YokohamaSyed has a real chance with his present motion. If the judge rules in his favor, he\u0027ll likely focus heavily on Gutierrez\u0027s failure to even pick up the phone and contact McClain -- a choice that, unlike an ultimate decision not to call a witness at trial, is difficult to treat as a legitimate strategic call.Criminal defense attorney in Portland, OregonLeaving Justice Scalia\u0027s seat empty until there is a new president would mean that difficult cases this term could come down to a tie, evenly split along ideological lines. So what will it take to get a new justice named?Independent source of news and analysis, from the academic and research community.Powered by the full weight of the Democratic Establishment, the Clinton juggernaut was designed to smoothly carry its idol across America and into the White House. It still may get there. But now it must traverse a far more treacherous and uncertain route than Hillary and her entourage ever imagined.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghPresident Obama has been saying for the past eight years that he wants to close the Guantanamo Bay detention center. Although Congress hasn\u0027t made it easy, his insistence on continuing to prosecute these cases in the military commissions only undermines the credibility of his convictions.Senior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstAs the election year wears on, you can expect Republicans to blame the economic slide on the Obama administration and the Democrats. You can expect Hillary Clinton to intensify her attacks on Bernie Sanders as the candidate of tax increases and big government. And you can expect the economic anxiety that drives the Trump and Sanders campaigns only to grow.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Given that this same party also decided -- on the night he was inaugurated -- that they would seek to prevent Barack Obama from enacting any legislation whatsoever, we can at least say that they are consistent.Author of \u0027Obama’s America: A Transformative Vision of Our National Identity\u0027Republicans feel they own the Scalia court position. Their comments and actions are consistent with the partisan war they have been waging in Washington from the day President Obama was first sworn in to office.Hofstra Journalism ProfessorAn expert might be reasonably good at predicting the growth of a single exponential technology (e.g. the Internet of Things), but try to predict the future when A.I., Robotics, VR, Synthetic Biology and Computation are all doubling, morphing and recombining... you have a very exciting (read: unpredictable) future. ?Chairman/CEO, XPRIZEThe IRS took five years to review the Crossroads GPS application for nonprofit social welfare status. This seems very odd since most Americans would need only five minutes to determine that such a group is about politics, not social welfare.International President, United SteelworkersThat pesky mother issue keeps cropping up in our collective political life--and will always dog Hillary Clinton\u0027s heels, as well as those of any woman who dares to seek a position of political power.Psychiatrist, Past President of American Psychoanalytic Association, Consultant on the intersection of Psychology and BusinessScalia promoted anything but justice in his opposition to the Voting Rights Act and affirmative action, women\u0027s reproductive freedoms, and in particular, the rights and freedoms of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and trans* people.Independent WriterThe industry is resorting to increasingly creative tactics in an apparent belief that there’s still room to grow this revenue source.Author, How to Be the World\u0027s Smartest Traveler (and Save Time, Money, and Hassle)We\u0027re conditioned early on, especially as women, to value security above all else and cling on to it at all costs, and it takes an exceptional sort of fearlessness to tune out the expectations of the people in your life and risk your own security, in pursuit of genuine happiness.Western Washington University alum, writer and wayward travelerJournalists and pundits had been waiting for it for months: a win for Sanders and Trump in the same primary. Then they could finally rehash their \"rise of populism\" articles. And we were not disappointed after the New Hampshire primariesAssociate Professor in the School of Public and International Affairs at the University of GeorgiaThe idea that a president with more than 10 months left in his term shouldn\u0027t do so is curious, but let\u0027s not pretend this is a serious tussle over constitutional intent.Editor/Publisher of Inside Michigan PoliticsSimply put, the so-called Syrian ceasefire is a sham. Contrary to the White House\u0027s announcement, it is not a first step towards a negotiated peace in the Syrian Civil War but rather a Russian attempt to forestall any intervention in support of the FSA in Aleppo until Syrian military forces can surround and defeat them.Best Selling Military History and World Affairs Author and Keynote SpeakerSyrians are waiting. Everywhere. Waiting for the next airstrike. Waiting to cross another border. Waiting for a smuggler to call back to to say if there is room on the rubber dinghy, or worse, if they will have to sail it. Waiting to be rescued in the middle of the sea. Waiting to die ... of starvation.VICE Correspondent \u0026 Emmy-nominated JournalistSome of the most courageous, inspiring, bad-ass people I know have mental health conditions, got treatment and rock at their lives.
