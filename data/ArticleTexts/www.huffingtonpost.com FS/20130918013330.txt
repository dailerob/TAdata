{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027The whittling away at the backlog of excess housing has allowed for a recovery in construction. It is now just under 3.1 percent of GDP. Given pre-bubble trends there is some room for further recovery, but it is unlikely to provide much additional boost to the economy from current levels. Barring another bubble, residential construction will only add a bit more than 1.0 percentage point to GDP as it recovers further. This is helpful, but in an economy that it still 6.0 percentage points (at $1 trillion in annual output) below its potential, it will not go far toward getting us back to full employment.Comments (355)Linda BergtholdHealth policy researcherAs the country prepares for open enrollment October 1st in the insurance exchanges of the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare), a small group of dedicated artists and politicians in Pennsylvania have been working toward a broader solution.Comments (618)Alicia BayerBlogger, A Magical ChildhoodWe are such a competitive culture that even our preschoolers have become trophies and bragging rights. Childhood shouldn\u0027t be a race.Comments (93)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027One of the most deceptive ideas continuously sounded by the Right is that the \"free market\" is natural and inevitable, existing outside and beyond government. So whatever inequality or insecurity it generates is beyond our control.Comments (1,367)Sandra Day O’Connor and John GlennThroughout American history, our country\u0027s greatest political and social movements have been fueled by the actions and ideas of an active and engaged citizenry.Comments (51)Joanna MontgomeryWife, mother, survivor, BRCA1 positiveThose of us who either opted to have mastectomies as a preventative measure, or had mastectomies as a life-saving measure, aren\u0027t excited about our \"new boobs.\" In truth, we\u0027ll never be the same. We see ourselves differently now when we look in the mirror, because we are different, inside as well as outside.Comments (423)Jeff MadrickRoosevelt Institute Senior Fellow; author, \u0027Age of Greed\u0027The stock and bond markets should not be the only ones rejoicing at Larry Summers\u0027s withdrawal from consideration to run the Federal Reserve. The nation\u0027s workers should, too. Janet Yellen, the remaining frontrunner for the position, is no wimp on inflation.Comments (11)Justine VogelPresident and CEO, RiverWoods of ExeterWe\u0027re not getting any younger -- neither are our parents. The older we get, the more we grow concerned about how old they\u0027re getting, and with that comes worry about \u0027what to do with mom and dad.\u0027Comments (21)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThe good news from today\u0027s 2012 income and poverty results is that for the first year since the great recession hit, things aren\u0027t getting worse. The bad news is that three years into an economic recovery, they\u0027re not getting better either.CommentsMarty KaplanDirector, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolSay goodnight to the dream that education, journalism, scientific evidence, media literacy or reason can provide the tools and information that people need in order to make good decisions. It turns out that in the public realm, a lack of information isn\u0027t the real problem.Comments (374)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesWho would have predicted just five years ago that potential contenders for the Democratic Party\u0027s 2016 presidential nomination would be knocking each other over -- in Iowa, no less -- trying to prove that they were the first to champion gay marriage?Comments (22)Kelly MacLeanStand up comic, actress, writer @thekellymacleanShe rings me up for $313. I resist the urge to unwrap and swallow whole another $6 truffle in protest. Barely. Instead, I reach for my wallet, flash her a quiet smile and say, \"Namaste.\"Comments (670)Stephanie SliekersCancer survivor and bloggerMy cancer doesn\u0027t have motives, free will, or spite. I find no solace in telling it to f*ck off, or claiming I\u0027m beating/fighting/standing up to it. It\u0027s no coincidence that these metaphors are generally the slogans of fundraising campaigns.Comments (11)David CoatesWorrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsHigher education costs are not soaring out of control. What is changing is the politically-charged matter of who should bear the cost -- the general taxpayer or the individual student. There is a policy choice tucked away here behind the overall numbers, and a rather ugly one at that.Comments (70)Doug KendallFounder and President, Constitutional Accountability CenterIt\u0027s no surprise that Warren\u0027s speech has drawn fire from the right. What is surprising is the weakness of the conservative response, which, in turn, demonstrates the air-tight case Warren has made about the pro-corporate trend at the Supreme Court.CommentsMarlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistMy friend Paul recently called me weeping. Broken leg? No. Death in the family? Nuh-uh. Cheating spouse? Nope. What my teary friend was suffering from was a sudden outbreak of empty nest syndrome. \"I just got back from dropping my kid off at college in the Midwest,\" he sniffed. \"I\u0027m a mess!\"CommentsJanet TavakoliPresident, Tavakoli Structured FinanceThe president was elected in part on his promise to effect change on the really tough issues, and there was no better time than when the crisis was fresh. I believe that went right out the window when he realized during his first campaign that corporations would throw money at him.Comments (24)Alison RosenCo-host, \u0027Adam Carolla Show\u0027; host, \u0027Alison Rosen Is Your New Best Friend\u0027Remember that scene in Dumbo where he\u0027s a baby and his mother is rocking him in her trunk and everyone is crying, especially me? That scene wrecked me. Years of therapy can\u0027t remove that image from my memory and it wasn\u0027t even real.CommentsTom EngelhardtEditor, TomDispatch.comYou will be denounced as a traitor, a defector, a criminal, and your acts called treasonous, even if you\u0027re one of the last hopes of the American republic.Comments (18)Robert ScheerEditor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027Despite his occasionally populist rhetoric, Obama proved highly solicitous of Wall Street interests at the expense of Main Street, and under the guidance of Summers, the Bush strategy of bailing out Wall Street continued under Obama.Comments (30)Riddhi ShahEditorial Director, Social Impact PlatformsWhatever my feelings toward beauty pageants and all the ways in which they make young women feel inadequate, at least this time, the world\u0027s most influential country is showing my people that a deep velvet brown complexion is nothing to be ashamed of.Comments (223)Ward AndersonSiriusXM Talk Radio Host, Author, ComedianYou\u0027re a good person. I can tell this about you already. You\u0027re kind to your neighbours and the people you work with say nice things about you when you\u0027re not around. This isn\u0027t about you. It\u0027s about the type of person that ruins your day by sucking the life out of a conversation, sucking the enthusiasm out of a room, and just plain sucking.Comments (22)Rana FloridaCEO, The Creative Class Group \u0026 Author, UpgradeLeaders who inspire, mentor, and teach -- rather than dictate and order -- will have more productive, more engaged and more loyal teams.CommentsArianna HuffingtonI\u0027m delighted to announce that HuffPost is joining forces with the e-commerce site Shopify as part of their Build-A-Business competition.Comments (21)Jeffrey LaurentiInternational affairs analyst and commentatorThe agreement that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov hammered out in Geneva at week\u0027s end will, if implemented, prove a milestone in the century-long effort to contain the horrors of modern war.Comments (24)Sec. Kathleen SebeliusSecretary of Health and Human ServicesThroughout the administration, we operate on the fundamental belief that every American deserves equal opportunity, equal protection, and equal rights under the law. That\u0027s why the Affordable Care Act is so important for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) Americans.CommentsRaymond J. LearsyAuthor, \u0027Ruminations on the Distortion of Oil Prices and Crony Capitalism\u0027If this government finally wants to send a signal to Main Street that it is no longer in the embrace in the tentacles of Wall Street, there is one person who won her spurs in spirited confrontation with Wall Street\u0027s power brokers and can wear their enmity as a badge of honor.Comments (12)Maureen RyanTV critic, The Huffington PostEvery time you thought things couldn\u0027t get worse, they did. Every time you thought the lowest point had been reached, it hadn\u0027t been. There was more. It kept coming.Comments (2,021)Sen. Amy KlobucharU.S. Senator from MinnesotaWe can fix the Voting Rights Act, we can pass the Same-Day Registration Act and other important election reforms, and we can finish the march that Congressman Lewis and so many other brave men and women started in Selma all those years ago.CommentsBruce LubinAuthor, Who Knew?To remove coffee stains from inside a glass coffee pot, add 1 tablespoon water, 4 teaspoons salt, and 1 cup crushed ice. Gently swirl until it is clean, then rinse thoroughly.Comments (342)Norman SolomonAuthor, \u0027War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death\u0027Now that public pressure has foiled U.S. plans to bomb Syria, the next urgent step is to build public pressure for stopping the deluge of weapons into that country.Comments (19)Jonathan Handel, 2013.17.09Nicholas Kralev, 2013.17.09Mark Adnum, 2013.17.09Cameron Esposito, 2013.17.09Michael B.
