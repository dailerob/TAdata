{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"After extensively documenting why my claim (made during a dust-up with Liz Cheney on This Week) that Halliburton had defrauded American taxpayers of \"hundreds of millions of dollars in Iraq\" was true, PolitiFact.com turned around and rated the statement \"Half True\". It was an object lesson in equivocation, and a prime exhibit of the kind of muddled thinking that dominates Washington and allows the powerful to escape accountability -- and our corrupt no-accountability status quo to continue wreaking havoc on our country. It\u0027s a favorite trick of those in power: using ambiguity and complexity as a sort of chemical dispersant on the truth. Dilute it enough and it becomes unrecognizable. So it\u0027s worth returning to the scene of the crime to do a little CSI exam of the evidence and see what we can conclude from PolitiFact\u0027s head-scratching conclusion.Read Post | CommentsRichard (RJ) Eskow, 07.05.2010Consultant, Writer, Policy AnalystThere\u0027s a new conventional wisdom forming in Washington, DC: the American dream of financial independence and security is gone. The ideal of \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\" is dead. Deal with it.Read Post | CommentsChris Kelly, 07.05.2010Writer, Real Time with Bill MaherAs I watched the fireworks with my kids on the Fourth, I realized I still believe in this system. If the people in charge were really as evil as the cynics and the conspiracy nuts say, Jay Leno would be dead as an unfunny doornail.Read Post | CommentsStanley Kutler, 07.04.2010E.

Abrams, 07.05.2010Authority on Sports LawThe egregious mistakes made by World Cup field officials are far more insufferable than the incessant vuvuzelas.
