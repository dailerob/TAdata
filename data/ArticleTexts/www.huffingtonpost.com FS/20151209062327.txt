Donald Trump is appealing to racial and religious fear and hate in order to advance his own success. But an even greater danger than Trump is the growing popular response to him, the standing ovations to his most vicious attacks on racial minorities, immigrants, and now all the members of a world religion.

President Sanders would always keep the humble, struggling, proud citizen at the center of what he does.CEO of MAYDAY.US, Associate Law Professor at Fordham, Corruption ScholarMuch of the media coverage of the Paris climate talks focuses on negotiations between country delegations. That work is vitally important. But here on the ground, it\u0027s clear that another powerful force is also shaping the outcome of the talks: civil society.Former President, NRDCYour every syllable is so vile as to leave an aftertaste that will linger long after your inevitable exit from the presidential race, making all others reluctant to turn bloviating ignorance into the foundation of a political career (Mark Cuban excepted).Professor, CUNY Graduate CenterAppointed by President Bill Clinton, I took my oath of office to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States of America with my hands on the Quran atop my wife\u0027s Bible.

It\u0027s directly trickling into to new legislation that Congress is currently considering -- legislation that will effectively create two classes of Americans.President, National Iranian American CouncilThe loss of confidence in government, fostered by many in government, is a more serious threat to American security than ISIS.
