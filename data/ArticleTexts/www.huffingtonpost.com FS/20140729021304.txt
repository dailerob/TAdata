{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Rather than focus on the newly-fashionable tax-avoidance strategy of changing corporate nationality, it makes more sense to tax any global corporation on all income earned in the United States (with high penalties for shifting that income abroad), and no longer tax \"American\" corporations on revenues earned outside America. Most other nations already follow this principle. In other words, let\u0027s stop worrying about whether big global corporations are \"American.\" We can\u0027t win that game. Focus instead on what we want global corporations of whatever nationality to do in America, and on how we can get them to do it.Albert Einstein is rumored to have said that one cannot solve a problem with the same thinking that led to it. Yet this is precisely what we are now trying to do with climate change policy.Professor of the History of Science and Affiliated Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Harvard UniversityYou have about 4,500 weeks to live, and seeing them all on one image is a weird experience.www.waitbutwhy.comLet\u0027s face it: most of us don\u0027t like David Gregory. He\u0027s the smug brat we always hated in high school. No wonder so many of us are salivating at rumors that NBC may relieve the grey-haired wonder boy from his Meet the Press duties.Writer, journalist, former MSNBC anchor and NBC correspondent. Mom of four. Former avid jogger and organized person.Within the next several weeks Illinois-based Walgreens drug store chain is set to decide if it will become what President Obama referred to last week as a \"corporate deserter\" by tearing up its U.S. Citizenship in order to cut its corporate taxes.Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersThe brilliance of Putinism lies in the regime\u0027s management of the public\u0027s habitual cynicism by appropriating the tools of conspiracy-mongering.Professor of Russian \u0026 Slavic Studies, New York UniversityA friend told me that back in the early aughts, it was customary for talent agents to whip out their cell phones during meetings to show that they had more important matters to attend to. Nowadays, who doesn\u0027t do that?Emmy® award-winning journalist and “Talk Stoop” hostSaudi Arabia is treading a fine line. According to my sources, Netanyahu\u0027s rejection of Kerry\u0027s peace initiative over the weekend was due in part to the full support of its Arab allies. Saudi Arabia\u0027s active support is keeping this brutal war going.Editor, Middle East EyeThere are many who want the government to play a rule in reducing inequality. That might be a desirable goal. However a higher priority would be to have the government stop playing a role in increasing inequality as it does with its support for the financial industry.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027We can no longer tolerate to be treated as sub-humans, deprived of our most basic human rights. We are trapped here, trapped between two deaths: death by Israeli bombs and missiles, and death by Israel\u0027s blockade of Gaza.Palestinian human rights worker in GazaIs it in the best interest of California to possibly be the source of a future \"hammer blow\" decision that will affect not just this state but all of the other states in the 9th District? That probably won\u0027t fly too well with the other governors or the citizens of those states.Systemic Risk and Global Stability Observer; Architect of Risk Measurement SystemsWhen 200 New York City fast-food workers walked off their jobs in November 2012, their demand of $15 an hour seemed like a fantasy. But over the weekend, as more than 1,000 fast-food workers from 50 cities gathered in Chicago for the first-ever nationwide fast-food workers convention, the workers\u0027 call for $15 looked prescient.Policy Analyst, National Employment Law ProjectSocial Security is the most effective and successful income-security program in the nation\u0027s history. Policymakers should design reforms judiciously so that it remains so.Founder and President, Center on Budget \u0026 Policy PrioritiesMost pit bulls aren\u0027t bred for anything -- by and large they\u0027re mutts, plain and simple, who happen to share a similarly blocky-shaped head.Animal Welfare Editor, The Huffington PostThe invocation of the nuclear option last November addressed a real problem with the functioning of the Senate, paved the way for a new generation of insightful legal minds to join the ranks of the federal judiciary, and has allowed the president to address the nation\u0027s judicial vacancy crisis by accelerating the pace of confirmations. We are all better off for it.Founder and President, Constitutional Accountability CenterThe historic participation of blacks and other minorities helped elect the first black president of the United States. But while we greatly exercised our right to vote in 2008, many failed to do the same two years later during the 2010 midterms. What we got were a slew of politicians who are more concerned with their own self-aggrandizement than with serving people.President, National Action NetworkI love what Hollywood could be, but I must say that I don\u0027t love what it is. I can\u0027t accept that while my daily life is filled with black and brown women, they are completely absent, erased, when I look at a TV or movie screen.Poet, author, and activistThe Times\u0027 editorial has the feel of legendary CBS News anchor Walter Cronkite coming out against the Vietnam war. They dropped a bomb on our country\u0027s disastrous war on marijuana with unprecedented force.Director of Media Relations, Drug Policy AllianceMy best day as a mom came about six months after my worst day as a mom.Blogger, \u0027Mommy In Sports\u0027According to the Controlled Substances Act, Eric Holder himself can reclassify anything on the list, with no more authority necessary than his own signature. Perhaps if Congress refuses to act, Holder (or Obama) will make this change on his own. That, more than a Times editorial, might more accurately be called marijuana\u0027s tipping point.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comIs it possible that even Warren Buffett has clay feet, stooping to the very actions whose cynicism and manipulative enterprise has made many so wary of a structure that rewards the few at the cost of the many?Author, \u0027Ruminations on the Distortion of Oil Prices and Crony Capitalism\u0027In these remaining few hours or Ramadan, do your best to spend a little bit of time with yourself and look inside your heart to see what are you carrying with you as you leave this month. Each of you has so much to share with this world.Executive Director and Chaplain, Islamic Center at New York UniversityIsrael relies on their ability to dominate and shape media messages and images to the same extent that they depend on their military to win battles. And because the Israelis have cultivated all too compliant partners in the press and in politics, their narrative of events often trumps reality.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Policymakers across the country need to understand the regressive and unjust nature of net metering policies and take steps to fix it. Black, brown or white, we can all be better stewards of our environment but let\u0027s be sure to have equitable policies that allow all communities to benefit on the same terms.Mayor of Tuskegee, AL; Founder of AL, National, and World Conferences of Black Mayors; founding co-chair of National Policy AlliancePoliticians in Washington, D.C., seem to have stopped talking -- and listening -- to their colleagues across the aisle, contributing to our virtually deadlocked Congress. While Washington appears to have stopped their conversations, I decided to start a new one.Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyThe American foreign policy community finds it difficult to come to terms with the variety of jihadist organizations, their disputes, and their inner directed passions. They almost seem to feel offended that the United States is not foremost on their minds.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghPoliticians have misled voters for as long as there have been politicians. At times, though, and not so long ago, it was not a death wish to claim to be a moderate willing to work with members of the other party. That\u0027s hardly possible when message makers call the shots.Author, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgThere is little reason to believe that the widely held claim that black and Latino students enter selective universities as comparatively inferior students will not cease to rear its ugly head. It is a pervasive stereotype that minority students must face from matriculation to graduation.Arts \u0026 Sciences Professor of Public Policy Studies and Economics, Chair of African and African American Studies and director of the Research Network on Racial and Ethnic Inequality at Duke UniversityArts \u0026 Sciences Professor of Public Policy Studies and Economics, Chair of African and African American Studies and director of the Research Network on Racial and Ethnic Inequality at Duke UniversityAssistant Professor and Deputy Chair in the Department of Puerto Rican \u0026 Latin@ Studies at Brooklyn College (City University of New York)Yes, I\u0027m tired, exhausted and bitter. Can\u0027t you tell I\u0027m at the end of my wits? My poor brain is fried and my body hurts. Sleep deprivation is truly the pits.Writer and blogger, Mammalingo.comHamas has reduced the Palestinian cause from one where Palestinians deserve a viable State to live on like any other nation, to a series of pity quarrels and disputes over side issues.Egyptian WriterRep. Keith Ellison made his position clear as soon as we began rolling tape, saying \"the real story today, in my humble view, is not income inequality.\"Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"HERE COMES THE PAIN",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
