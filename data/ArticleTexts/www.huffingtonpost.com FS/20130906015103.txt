{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Gavin de BeckerSecurity specialist; Founder, Gavin de Becker \u0026 AssociatesToday, we are warned by John Kerry and others that if we don\u0027t act with lethal force, the Syrian government will kill thousands more people. Let\u0027s not be deluded: When we do intervene militarily, the Syrian government (and we) will kill thousands more. And anti-Assad forces will also kill more. We\u0027ve been reminded often in the past few weeks that chemical weapons are awful -- and carefully not reminded that conventional weapons are too. It\u0027s tragic when civilians are killed by their own countrymen or when foreign civilians are killed by our countrymen. It\u0027s tragic when our soldiers are killed or when their soldiers are killed. But none of those tragedies will be influenced by the political posturing this week. Rather, the result of congressional hearings is that responsibility for the attack(s) on Syria will be distributed more comfortably for all concerned, and there will be a more comfortable consensus about which of these tragedies are necessary evils.Comments (187)David BromwichProfessor of Literature, Yale UniversityThis House desires to obtain a full knowledge of the facts that go to establish whether it should vote for war against the government of Syria.Comments (27)Dennis J. KucinichFmr. 16-year Member of US Congress; Two-time US Presidential CandidateThe American people have a right to a full release and vetting of all facts before their elected representatives are asked to make a decision of great consequence for America, Syria and the world.Comments (613)Luis Moreno OcampoFormer Chief Prosecutor, International Criminal CourtThe Syrian conflict offers the world an opportunity: to find an innovative response to establish global order.Comments (242)Arianna HuffingtonAloha! I\u0027m here for the launch of our newest edition, HuffPost Hawaii. We are delighted to be partnering with Honolulu Civil Beat, a beacon of journalism in Hawaii focusing on public affairs and investigative reporting, with deep roots in the local culture.Comments (246)Terry O\u0027NeillPresident, National Organization for WomenThere has never been a woman chair of the Fed, and correcting that inequity is long overdue, but it\u0027s also true that Dr. Yellen is the best person for the job, male or female.Comments (73)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Even if the president musters enough votes to strike Syria, at what political cost? Any president has a limited amount of political capital to mobilize support for his agenda, in Congress and, more fundamentally, with the American people.Comments (121)Joseph A. PalermoProfessor, historian, authorWhen it comes to Syria the old saying that even a broken clock is correct twice a day might apply to the Tea Party faction of the Republican Party.Comments (36)Sheneka AdamsModel, actress, bloggerIf anyone has ever been to a mental facility, then you know how scary it is. You have no rights, you belong to the state. Long story short, I got out of there and I vowed never to do drugs again, but I knew that was a lie.Comments (13)Barbra StreisandSinger; Actress; Director; Composer; ActivistOur voter participation rates are already among the lowest in the world\u0027s democracies, but conservatives seem intent on lowering it further. But guns, why, owning them should be easier than ever.Comments (106)Russell SimmonsFounder, GlobalGrind.comMr. President, our country\u0027s recent history makes it very difficult for you to obtain the world\u0027s approval that we should attack Syria based on any sort of moral authority.Comments (383)Lori DuronMother of two, wife, blogger and author, \u0027Raising My Rainbow\u0027By trying to eliminate the need for a gay son to come out, I created an environment where a straight son felt the need to come out. As I try to learn from my mother\u0027s mistakes, I may be making some new ones of my own. I guess that\u0027s how it goes with parenting.Comments (285)John SkylarPhD candidate, science fiction author, and bloggerYou may just be unaware, you may have failed to learn about the city before you came to it, you may have forgotten to keep in mind that you\u0027re inconveniencing a horde of other people.Comments (817)Seamus McKiernanBlog Editor, Special Projects, Huffington PostUN weapons inspectors are working \"round the clock.\" But will the world see their full report on Syria before a possible U.S. military strike?CommentsMike JulianelleBlogger, DadandBuried.comHere\u0027s the thing: It\u0027s not up to women to protect men from themselves. And it\u0027s certainly not The Teenage Girl\u0027s responsibility to help teenage boys, or college guys, or middle-aged men, control their basest instincts.Comments (74)Thomas McKennaEditorial Fellow at The Huffington PostThe Yankees aren\u0027t winning with money in 2013 so much as with a makeshift, cobbled together bootleg version of MoneyballCommentsOprah WinfreyChairman and CEO, Oprah Winfrey NetworkYears ago, my friend and trainer Bob Greene said to me, \"Hawaii is one of the best places on Earth to live.\" I discovered he was right. There\u0027s a reason it\u0027s often called paradise. I am blessed that for at least two months out of the year (working on three) I get to call it home.Comments (157)June HaynesFounder, June Haynes Luxury RetailingLast week, I attended a dinner party. As we all know, if no one remotely interesting ends up sitting on the left or right of you, it can end up being a long and boring night. Well, I got lucky.CommentsJamie CourtAuthor, \u0027The Progressive\u0027s Guide to Raising Hell\u0027; President, Consumer WatchdogIf we are going to let cloud-based computers operate like our eyes and ears, and allow for videos and recordings to be fed to Google\u0027s corporate cloud without the public\u0027s knowledge, invasion of privacy laws better apply.Comments (44)The Levo LeagueA thriving community of young professionals, mentors, and innovative companies taking Gen Y by storm.I don\u0027t have work friends and life friends, I just have friends. I don\u0027t have designated work time and play time, I just have my 24 hours to manage. I don\u0027t have work-life balance, I have work-life blend -- and I couldn\u0027t be happier.Comments (29)Jeff SchweitzerScientist and former White House Senior Policy Analyst; Ph.D. in marine biology/neurophysiologyReligion and science are incompatible at every level. The two seek different answers to separate questions using fundamentally and inherently incompatible methods. Nothing can truly bring the two together without sacrificing intellectual honesty.Comments (435)Leigh McMullan AbramsonWriterIt didn\u0027t matter that I confused Shavuot with Sukkot or had epically bad Hebrew pronunciation or even that I didn\u0027t know if I could give up Christmas carols, I could bake a first-rate challah. The rest would work itself out.Comments (17)Scott Barry Kaufman, Ph.D.Author, \u0027Ungifted: Intelligence Redefined\u0027; co-founder, The Creativity PostThe latest findings from the real neuroscience of creativity suggest that the right brain/left brain distinction is not the right one when it comes to understanding how creativity is implemented in the brain.CommentsMark SissonFormer elite marathoner and triathlete; Author, \u0027The Primal Blueprint\u0027For many people, a \"gluten-free\" label unfortunately bestows a cachet of health onto whatever processed food it graces. Potato chips? They\u0027re gluten-free! Triple-chocolate brownie mud slide? Eat without guilt! Of course, you don\u0027t actually need gluten-free products to go gluten-free.Comments (81)Dennis SantiagoSystemic Risk and Global Stability Observer; Architect of Risk Measurement SystemsAmerica is better than this. The United States Congress is better than this. Somehow we need to find a way make our White House is better than this again.CommentsRobert CreamerPolitical Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersThere has been a lot said in the last week comparing the Congressional resolution authorizing the use of force to punish Bashar al Assad\u0027s government for using chemical weapons to the resolution authorizing the Iraq War. Nothing could be further from the truth.Comments (58)Ryan HolidayMedia strategistWhile traditional marketing chases vague notions like \"branding\" and \"mind share,\" growth hackers relentlessly pursue users and growth -- and when they do it right, those users beget more users, who beget more users.CommentsPaul SzepTwo-time Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonistComments (32)Zach WeisbergFounder, The InertiaI\u0027ve met enough dedicated surfers who are absolute jerks to know that surfing alone cannot save humanity. However, after spending nearly 15 years immersed in the sport, I believe elements of surfing have the potential to ground human beings in a uniquely meaningful way.CommentsMarlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistWhen I was a kid, nobody set a table or stocked a pantry like my Mom. As a true Sicilian, her love of food was matched only by her keen sense of display. She always said, \"The eyes eat before the stomach.\" And all these years later, I can still picture what our kitchen looked like every year at this time: big bowls and platters everywhere, filled with the season\u0027s fresh harvest of brightly colored fruits and vegetables.CommentsShan WellsNationally syndicated political cartoonistCommentsSteven Lindsey, 2013. 5.09Shira Lazar, 2013. 5.09Brad Friedman and Desi Doyen, 2013. 5.09Bettina Korek, 2013. 5.09Simon Saradzhyan, 2013. 5.09Tom Bartolomei, 2013. 5.09Sarah van Gelder, 2013. 5.09Dennis Santiago, 2013. 5.09David Finkle, 2013. 5.09Jonathan Marshall, 2013. 5.09Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"NO \u0027QUAGMIRE\u0027",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
