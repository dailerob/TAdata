{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Do you have anything special planned for Veterans Day? Did you even realize that today is Veterans Day? Sadly, in much the same way that the wars we are fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq have been pushed to the periphery of our national conversation, the day set aside to honor America\u0027s veterans usually gets short shrift. To honor the sacrifice and service of the men and women of America\u0027s armed services, HuffPost Impact is launching Salute to Service -- a series highlighting the stories of veterans who have committed their time, energy, and effort to serving their fellow soldiers. It would be a fitting tribute if Veterans Day could become a national day of service devoted to giving back to those who have given so much in service of our country -- as well as a day that ensures that the plight of America\u0027s vets stays on the radar all year long.Read Post | CommentsAaron Sorkin, 11.11.2010Playwright, screenwriter and television writerIf you really want to honor our troops you won\u0027t use them for an easy applause line, you won\u0027t use them to get votes, or, most insulting to them of all, to divide us into real Americans and fake Americans.Read Post | Comments (251)Paul Rieckhoff, 11.11.2010Executive Director and Founder, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of AmericaIt doesn\u0027t matter if you voted for the Green Party or the Tea Party, live in Boston or the Bayou; Veterans Day is about uniting as a country and supporting our nation\u0027s troops and veterans.Read Post | CommentsRobert L. Borosage, 11.10.2010President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureVoters increasingly believe Washington is controlled by special interests that feed off their tax dollars and that politicians cannot hear them.

The best thing new Tea Party-elects can do for veterans will be to stop our unaudited spending and unaccountable behavior in that realm.Read Post | CommentsAndy Borowitz, 11.11.2010Comedian and creator of BorowitzReport.comAccording to a Somali pirate spokesperson, the recent fire that crippled the giant cruise ship Carnival Splendor \"has sent a shiver through the pirate community.\"Read Post | CommentsHuffington Post, 11.11.2010When it comes to war, our veterans often get lost in discussions defined by heated political opinions on either side. This Veterans Day, we\u0027d like to put politics aside and focus on the soldiers and veterans themselves.Read Post | CommentsRobert Creamer, 11.11.2010Political organizer, strategist and authorFederal deficit commission members have lost their memories. They seem to have forgotten what caused the deficit. And they have certainly forgotten that we know how to eliminate the deficit without making the middle class pay the bill.Read Post | CommentsLt. Dan Choi, 11.11.2010For some veterans, the healing cannot begin until we enlist in another war at home.

Elisberg, 11.11.2010Political writer and screenwriterContrary to Republican analogies, government does not operate like your family. Government is not run like a business. Government protects the greater good of all, with the ever-changing consent of those it serves.Read Post | CommentsTony Schwartz, 11.11.2010President of The Energy Project, Author of The Way We\u0027re Working Isn\u0027t WorkingThere is precious little scientific evidence to suggest that genes are our destiny--and more and more evidence of neuroplasticity--the capacity to influence the way our genes express themselves.Read Post | CommentsNigel Sheinwald, 11.11.2010British Ambassador to the United StatesToday is Veterans Day over here, and Remembrance Day back in the UK.
