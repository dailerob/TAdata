{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Author, \u0027Dangerous Ground\u0027If there is ever going to be a solution to the problem of the Islamic State that has a hope of preserving the current geo-political structure of Mesopotamia and the Levant, it rests with the survival of Bashar al-Assad\u0027s regime and the resurgence of Syria as a viable national player in the region. Turkey took a leading role in divorcing itself from the Assad regime in 2011, an action which, in many ways, helped precipitate the current Islamic State fiasco. What is needed now is not a continuation of this disastrous policy, but rather a \"Road to Damascus\" conversion on the part of Turkey which re-embraces Bashar al-Assad as the legitimate ruler of Syria, and, in doing so, creates the foundation for the isolation and defeat of the Islamic State in Syria, and later Iraq.Back in 1996, my mother was interviewed on Good Morning America. They were doing a story on the November election and wanted to know why she, an 89-year-old Catholic woman, was voting for Democrats. Her words are as relevant today, as they were 18 years ago.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027The new generation of women at work has been peeled, prodded and parsed from every angle -- their education, their numbers, their issues, their needs, their frustrations. But you would be hard-pressed to find one illuminating equivalent study on the male side of the gender divide.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarAmtrak police has not reported a single instance of finding and catching a potential terrorist or serious threat as a result of its suspicious activity reports, yet it is using the same heavy-handed, dragnet approach that we\u0027ve seen in many of the government\u0027s other counter-terrorism and drug trafficking prevention efforts.William J. Brennan Fellow, ACLU\u0027s Speech, Privacy, and Technology ProjectNo doubt the Obama administration feels overwhelmed. Who has time for India? But make time President Obama must. India matters today. It will matter much more tomorrow, especially if Prime Minister Modi commits his political capital to eliminate barriers to entrepreneurship, investment and growth.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteMany assume that diplomacy is a ruthless game of hegemony in which one just gives lip service to harmony as a strategy for justifying one\u0027s actions. But what if harmony was actually the goal of diplomacy?Chairman and CEO of the JoongAng Media NetworkEbola-hawking candidates are trying for a bait and switch, but my bet\u0027s on women. Voting for someone who plays on Ebola fears while denying female workers a chance at equal pay is a fool\u0027s game -- and female voters are not fools.Money Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsToo bad the term \"socialism\" was appropriated by Karl Marx, because it would be an apt description of today\u0027s emerging social economy. The social media revolution is transforming the way we create wealth, work, learn, play, raise our children, and probably even the way we think.Advisor to government and business leaders; Author, \u0027Macrowikinomics\u0027How Applebees managed to turn shrimp and sautéed vegetables into one of the saltiest foods in America may be the eighth wonder of the world.The New York Times best-selling author of Eat It to Beat It!, Eat This, Not That and The Abs Diet, and the Nutrition and Wellness Editor at ABC NewsFor the first time in 13 years, the DOE now makes clear that states, school districts, and schools must make education resources equally available to all students without regard to race, color, or national origin. This is some of the unfinished business of the civil rights movement and a giant step forward for poor children, often children of color.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundWhen Owen is afraid, he comes to me. And I want him to feel like he can always do that, whether he\u0027s 7 or 27.Publisher, TheHappiestHome.comA huge gulf exists in farmer attitudes toward science. Growers clearly accept the scientific evidence that modified food is safe while rejecting the scientific evidence that climate change is real and caused by human activity. And this chasm is driven by simple economics. One finding makes farmers money, but the other doesn\u0027t -- yet.The Republic of AwesomeThese dimples in my skin represent the meals and belly laughs I now share with friends. They represent the time and energy I have claimed and now use to focus on my goal and dreams instead of ever-thinner thighs.Author, actress, fairytale dreamer. Her debut memoir will help those with eating disorders attain happiness and freedom.I\u0027d heard about -- and desperately wanted to try -- programs that let visitors take shelter dogs out hiking. It was a beautiful fall day, perfect for going for a hike. So my friend and I -- and my dog Murray -- stopped by a local animal shelter to pick up a dog to join us.Animal Welfare Editor, The Huffington PostJokowi should take advantage of the current surge of optimism and popularity to push through difficult policies quickly, taking advantage of urban Indonesians\u0027 obsession with social media to take the debate out of the bubble blown by Jakarta\u0027s political elite.Author, Indonesia Etc.: Exploring the Improbable NationSchool officials defend their quick resort to call in the school or city police with the claim that black students do commit more serious offenses than other students. There\u0027s nothing to support this.Author and political analystWe hear political pundits saying it is a mistake to compromise. It takes \"give\" and \"take\" -- and that takes work -- it doesn\u0027t just happen. There are multiple examples, starting with our founding fathers, of people in government that held very firm views on various issues, but made compromises to reach consensus.AuthorWord seeped out that The Donald was hesitating. Did he not want to pay? Could he not pay?Contributing editor, Vanity FairFinding time for intimacy with kids around can be hard. By the time they go to bed at night, it\u0027s a miracle if you have enough energy to make it to the living room couch without collapsing.Author, blogger at MommyAtoZBlog.comMany take our freedom of speech for granted, especially in a noisy election season, or when the Supreme Court denigrates its importance through decisions like Citizens United. But for too many victims, the freedom to speak up about the nightmare of domestic violence is still a dream.Candidate for CA State Senate SD-26While gun violence can happen anywhere, as Ottawa shows, it happens much more in the United States than any other developed country. Why the discrepancy? The full answer is complicated, but one of the driving factors is not.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersWith Prop 46, California voters can do what the politicians and the status-quo crowd won\u0027t: Nudge our healthcare system toward safer practices, deter doctor substance abuse and hold negligent physicians accountable.President, Brockovich Research \u0026 ConsultingAs a first-time mom, I\u0027ve come to this simple realization: If you are worried that you\u0027re not a good parent, trust me, that makes you an amazing parent. It\u0027s the parents who don\u0027t worry that we should be worried about.A Mobile Community for ParentsWe have seen everything from historic droughts and extreme wildfires ravaging communities in California, to vanishing wildlife habitat in Alaska, to toxic algae blooming out of control and contaminating drinking water supplies in America\u0027s heartland. How much more do we need to know about the devastating effects of climate change before Congress takes action?U.S. Senator from CaliforniaOn the whole, is American exceptionalism a force for good? The question shouldn\u0027t be hard to answer. To make an exception of yourself is as immoral a proceeding for a nation as it is for an individual.Professor of Literature, Yale UniversityI\u0027ve got my fingers crossed for our neighbors to the south to join us in a legal weed wonderland, and it\u0027s not for the reasons you might think.Founder of Mirth Provisions, a Washington State company that crafts cannabis-infused beverages with high-quality, local ingredients.The ways in which we spend have changed. We have different attitudes about debt, and even though the job market has improved, millions continue to struggle as wages have not caught up.Financial Expert, Journalist, AuthorAs a female Republican candidate with extreme, far right-wing views and a love for guns, Iowa\u0027s U.S. Senate hopeful Joni Ernst is a lot like Sarah Palin or Michele Bachmann.Activist and political blogger at LatestOutrage.orgLegislators need to pass a law that will provide a guide for colleges and universities and require them to share information with each other and with law enforcement about campus sexual assaults. The detection of a pattern requires sufficient data and someone looking at that data. Right now we have neither.College student defense lawyer representing students in universities and court, criminal defense counsel, former prosecutor \u0026 writerAfter twenty-two days, on July 18th, Kolia was discharged from the hospital, certified Ebola free. He had survived!International medical and public health expert; Senior Advisor to Liberia’s Ebola Response; Senior Advisor to the Division of Global Psychiatry at Massachusetts General HospitalBen Bradlee was undoubtedly the best newsroom leader I ever worked for. He pushed you to be better, spotted the weak spots in your draft and had a nose for news.
