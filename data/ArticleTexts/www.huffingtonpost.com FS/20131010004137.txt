{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Janet TavakoliPresident, Tavakoli Structured FinanceBloomberg News\u0027 Yalman Onaran wrote an article on Monday about the disaster that would unfold if we don\u0027t raise the debt ceiling and the U.S. has a technical default by missing an interest payment on U.S. Treasuries. James Kochan\u0027s quote summed up my feelings: \"Well, holy cripes!\" It has never happened in modern history and would be a disaster greater than the September 2008 financial crisis. China and Japan combined own $2.4 trillion in U.S. Treasuries, and they are understandably upset with the U.S. about the possibility of a technical default. Most of the financial press has focused on how awful a technical default would be, and who is upset. But our leaders might ask a different question. Who are the reprobates that are cheering for the possibility of a technical default on the U.S.? Who stands to gain? Who might be happy to set off this financial bomb?Comments (162)Niall FergusonLaurence A. Tisch Professor of History at Harvard University; Senior Fellow of the Hoover Institution, Stanford UniversityWhy, you may ask, did Krugman feel the need to be so bold (and so wrong) in predicting the euro\u0027s collapse over and over again, in his column, on his blog and to every media outlet that would give him an interview?Comments (342)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027If we get to October 17 and the Republicans are still holding the nation hostage, the president has only one option.Comments (1,011)George LogothetisAt the core of human motivation is the idea that tomorrow can be better than today. People will fight oppressors, combat unending peril, unite through unparalleled adversity, all in the hope that tomorrow can be better than today.CommentsAlissa ParkerBlogger, TheParkerFive and co-founder, safeandsoundschools.orgI miss Em a lot lately. I miss everything about her sweet, beautiful face smiling up at me. There are days when my face, I am sure, looks a lot like Emilie\u0027s did the day we let her butterflies go.Comments (145)Dan GolemanAuthor, \u0027Focus: The Hidden Driver of Excellence\u0027The more focused we are, the more successful we can be at whatever we do. And, conversely, the more distracted, the less well we do. This applies across the board: sports, school, career.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorI\u0027ve found her analysis of the problems in the recent and current economy uniquely clear and persuasive. It\u0027s not over \u0027til it\u0027s over, and it hasn\u0027t started yet, but I suspect she\u0027ll be approved by the Senate.CommentsJon HotchkissCreator, ThisvsThatShow.comThe minute anyone says the government shutdown is the fault of the Democrats in Congress and President Obama, please show them this video.Comments (30)Hannah BrencherWriter, Millennial Communications Expert, Founder of MoreLoveLetters.comLife is a steep, uphill battle but it\u0027s fierce and it\u0027s beautiful and you\u0027ll be sad to see it go if you live it right.Comments (117)Paul PolmanCEO, UnileverWhen people talk about new forms of capitalism, this is what I have in mind: companies that show, in all transparency, that they are contributing to society, now and for many generations to come. Not taking from it.Comments (71)Paul SzepTwo-time Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonistCommentsJoseph BobrowFounder and president, Coming Home ProjectIn the case of a recent DoD decision regarding the mental health of our service members, evem Churchill\u0027s old line about Americans understates our capacity for doing the wrong thing over and over again.CommentsMichael V. Kaplen and Shana De CaroGoddell\u0027s disingenuous portrayal of the league\u0027s concern about the health and safety of the players is incredible at best. His assertion that the league has been forthcoming with medical information as it has become available, defies credulity.CommentsRep. Judy ChuU.S. Representative for California\u0027s 27th DistrictWhile the Senate addressed immigration\u0027s complexities in a comprehensive package, House Republican leaders cherry picked the few reforms they were willing to address. This is no way to solve one of the greatest challenges of our time. The American people have waited long enough -- it\u0027s time for the House to act.CommentsAnn BrenoffSenior Writer, The Huffington PostWe all know that money can\u0027t buy us happiness, right? Even accepting that idea as gospel, there are some things that we are mighty happy we spent our money on. Here are seven that come to mind.Comments (102)Sean McElweeWriterWith the possibility of the government defaulting on its debt looming, it\u0027s worth critically examining some of the more popular far-right talking points.Comments (11)Wendy MacNaughtonIllustrator and graphic journalistCommentsPeter MontgomerySenior Fellow, People for the American WayThe Values Voter Summit makes clear how completely the Religious Right\u0027s leaders are working to merge their activists\u0027 anti-abortion and anti-gay zeal with the anti-government extremism of the Tea Party. Actually, it goes beyond that.Comments (72)Spencer OvertonProfessor of Law at The George Washington University Law School; Senior Fellow at DemosI attended today\u0027s U.S. Supreme Court oral argument in the case challenging contribution limits. If the Justices rewrite campaign finance law by striking down the contribution limits, checks of up to $2.95 million each from wealthy contributors will corrupt democracy.Comments (221)Clayton B. CornellSpartanTraveler.comLong-term traveling can teach you more than almost anything else. About yourself, about life, about what you need to be happy. It\u0027s too easy to get complacent at home and if you aren\u0027t at least a little uncomfortable, you probably aren\u0027t learning anything.CommentsCharlie KimFounder and CEO, Next JumpMy mom is a pastor of a church. We had a discussion once: why do I need to send church tithes, 10 percent of my monthly pay...monthly. How about if I write one check at the end of the year. Her response was as simple and wise as our mothers\u0027 can be: \"Because you won\u0027t.\"CommentsRichard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureTheir budget stance offends many Americans\u0027 sense of morality, since they\u0027re asking poor and middle-class Americans to subsidize the luxuries of the wealthy and the profits of powerful corporations. But in the end the country may reject their ideology for an even simpler reason: We can\u0027t afford it anymore.Comments (297)Joshua A. DouglasAssistant Professor of Law, University of Kentucky College of LawCongress, in its considered judgment, imposed an aggregate limit on campaign contributions in an effort to root out corruption. The question of whether the Court should defer to this legislative judgment did not receive much play at the Supreme Court today.Comments (31)Root CapitalSahel\u0027s native trees -- like Dr. Seuss\u0027 fantastical, colorful truffula trees in his tale The Lorax -- are far more than they appear.CommentsTrita ParsiPresident, National Iranian American CouncilAre these countries destined to be enemies? Is a war between the two inevitable? Not at all. Behind the surface, there is a remarkably different story -- one of friendship and collaboration even at the height of their ideologiocal clashes.Comments (17)Jenny Dewey RohrichPhotographer, blogger, country girlThere is no denying the fact that our relationship is an adventure. Being married is a feat in and of itself -- being married to a farmer adds a whole other layer.Comments (21)Eve TahminciogluCareerdiva.netBoth HP and Yahoo\u0027s CEOs seem to think more face time translates into more light bulbs above employees\u0027 heads. But is that really true?Comments (52)Elizabeth SpiersEntrepreneur, journalist and digital media expertAs with coding and management and matters of finance and marketing, relationships have a learning curve. You learn the basics of \"relationshiptiva\" (yes, I made up that word): How to deal with sexual etiquette, mundane everyday things, scheduling, and appropriate meetings with close friends, and some equitable plan for who\u0027s supposed to pay for dinner or wash the dishes this time. These are basics. And if you\u0027re learning them in your thirties, it\u0027s going to be much harder.Comments (59)Josh HorwitzExecutive Director, Coalition to Stop Gun ViolenceInsurrectionist rhetoric might work well in marketing firearms to civilians on the far right wing of American politics. But with police chiefs and generals? Not so much.Comments (91)Angelina ChapinBlogs Editor, Huffington Post CanadaA lot of brainpower has gone into dissecting whether Miley Cyrus is sexually empowered or not. Sorry to be a buzzkill, but there\u0027s only one person who can decide whether Miley has a healthy relationship with sexuality: the woman herself.Comments (36)Marty KaplanDirector, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolNow that the theorists of the Higgs boson have won the Nobel Prize, here\u0027s my take on the God part of the God particle, and why I have a mancrush on the Large Hadron Collider.Comments (111)Rabbi Jordie Gerson, 2013. 9.10John Rosenthal, 2013. 9.10Beth Arnold, 2013. 9.10Jonathan Lilly, 2013. 9.10Anthony Swift, 2013. 9.10Eric Pape, 2013. 9.10Sarah Cunningham, 2013. 9.10Colleen Logan, Ph.D., 2013. 9.10Marc Gopin, 2013. 9.10Domenick Scudera, 2013. 9.10Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"POLL: GOP HITS RECORD LOW CONSERVATIVE CRACKUP ON DEBT SHAKEDOWN: 2 Key Groups OK Debt Ceiling Hike...
