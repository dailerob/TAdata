{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Author, \u0027Tear Down This Myth\u0027America\u0027s snooze alarm went off again yesterday. Slowly, fitfully, people are starting to wake up from a long national slumber. Our psychic clock radio switched on this time to a Middle Eastern jazz riff, punctuated by the screams of the tortured. The powerful damnation of the Senate\u0027s lengthy and comprehensive report on torture by the CIA during its post-9/11 counter-terrorism program proves that there is truth... and then there is truth acknowledged. Yes, the new details are stunning, shocking, alarming, but the broader message of the terror report is exactly what a dedicated minority of folks have been saying for years, to a nation basking in plausible denial.If you\u0027re a Congressperson looking to sneak through something shady, the omnibus budget bill is the perfect opportunity since 1) It\u0027s 1600 pages long and relatively easy to hide things in, and 2) Congress has to pass it or the government shuts down. Again.Director, Represent.UsThere has been a suggestion in recent days that now is not a good time to release a review prepared by the Senate Intelligence Committee of the CIA\u0027s detention and interrogation program. But is there ever a good time to admit our country tortured people?U.S. Senator from CaliforniaThis ran in a NYT article in the Music section dated April 9, 2006, and it read, as we posted at the time, like \"fiddling while Iraq burns.\" In light of the Senate C.I.A. torture report summary released yesterday, however, it strikes a different chord.Publisher of the visual politics and media literacy site, BagNewsNotesWe women hear a lot about side effects of birth control, but we don\u0027t hear as much about the side benefits. If you haven\u0027t had a conversation with your doctor lately about family planning, you may be in for some surprises.Author, \u0027Trusting Doubt\u0027 and \u0027Deas and Other Imaginings\u0027; Founder, WisdomCommons.orgEmploying this many workers may make the company seem virtuous and altruistic, but the business model is not a model other companies should emulate.Communications Director, Brave New FoundationSuccessful companies like Apple need to make fundamental changes to the way they allocate resources and stop throwing away America\u0027s most valuable asset for future innovation -- you.Author and cultural theoristThe threat of climate change is screaming at us. We must approach this global threat with the urgency that it warrants. We must work together, rich nations and developing nations as well, to avoid the instability and vulnerability that will surely befall us if we fail to heed the warning on climate change.U.S. Secretary of StateBody shaming is a part of American culture, at once abhorrent and everywhere. Women are shamed for being fat, skinny, tall, short, flat chested, busty, too plain, too sexy. But lately, there seems to be a different response from women -- frustration followed by acceptance and moving on.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarThe personal economies of many ordinary Americans still have not recovered from the Great Recession that resulted from Wall Street\u0027s speculative frenzy. It cost 8 million Americans their jobs, destroyed the 401K plans of millions of retirees, sunk our home values, and cut our wages.Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersFor the CIA officials involved in torture, one thing was clear from the very beginning: The only way they would be forgiven for what they did was if they could show it had saved lives. It was the heart of their rationale. It was vital to public acceptance. It was how they would avoid prosecution.Senior Writer, The InterceptIf traditional capital punishment has declined, another kind of capital punishment continues unabated. This other form of capital punishment, far more common than the traditional kind, involves the killing of Americans by the police without benefit of charges, trial, jury, or the right to appeal.Professor of sociology, University of California at BerkeleyIt is time is for the Palestinians to reexamine the shifting political landscape in Israel and among themselves and change course now, however incongruous that may be, because it is indispensable to their overall objective.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUIf US officials tortured people, and we know torture is, was and always has been illegal, why isn\u0027t the government prosecuting them? Maybe there\u0027s some complicated legal reason that isn\u0027t obvious to most of us why the evidence wouldn\u0027t hold up in court. If so, it\u0027s in the government\u0027s interest to explain what that is.Senior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstConsistency is the hobgoblin of little countries: Superpowers can do whatever they wish. But the United States enjoys only the illusion of free rein. In fact, America is held hostage by the very way it conducts its foreign policy.Director, Foreign Policy In FocusAs Christians, we can\u0027t preach about the cross as a life-giving moment, while continuing to participate in the same dehumanizing, degrading, and justifying of violence that allowed Rome to nail our Savior to the cross. This must stop.Writer, Blogger, \u0026 SpeakerIn the absence of greater agitation, limitation and oversight, the national security establishment is likely to get worse, not better, in terms of its accountability to democratic control and the rule of law.Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicyWant restaurant-quality braised short ribs and super gourmet demi-glace sauce too? Of course you do.Founder of wellwornfork.com - helping home cooks learn gourmet techniques in the kitchen.The budget deal hammered out this week between Republican and Democratic negotiators literally imperils the economy. Congress is doing Wall Street\u0027s bidding with this budget, and it needs to be stopped.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourMany of the condemnations of police brutality have excluded the experiences of black women who have been brutalized in custody. The ongoing media blackout surrounding the case of 13 black women allegedly assaulted by a police officer in Oklahoma City may be the hardest evidence of the devaluation of African-American women\u0027s lives.Associate professor and associate chair of the African and African Diaspora Studies Department at The University of Texas at AustinAs a nation, the United States is infected with racial and socio-economic myopia. Sadly, the malignant biases that support the empowered also undermine the ability of the disempowered to identify and empathize with one another.Director, Center for Innovation in Engineering and Science Education, Stevens Institute of TechnologyBecause of decisions likely to be taken this year and next, nuclear weapons will become a normalized and permanent part of the 21st-century American arsenal, and therefore of the arsenals of many other nations; nuclear weapons, that is, will have become an essential element of the human future -- as long as that future lasts.Distinguished Scholar-in-Residence, Suffolk UniversityThere is a wealth of solid science demonstrating that cruel forms of interrogation do not elicit good intelligence. In fact, this kind of interrogation often leads to resistance and falsehood.Author, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027Nelson Mandela, who founded The Elders in 2007, believed transformative leaders needed the generosity and courage to see beyond narrow self-interest. No challenge requires these qualities as much, or as urgently, as climate change.Chair of the Kofi Annan Foundation and The EldersFormer President of Mexio, Member of The EldersA half-century later, my father\u0027s words are still powerful, still relevant. Justice, racial equality, and the Beloved Community that he often described are still, to paraphrase Victor Hugo, ideas whose time has come. In fact, their time is long overdue.Chief Executive Officer, The King CenterNot content with the loosened campaign finance rules made possible by Citizens United, the GOP is attempting to pass a stealth provision that would open the big money floodgates even further.Activist and political blogger at LatestOutrage.orgOne theme is emerging loud and clear: if the world is serious about addressing the climate crisis, we must get off fossil fuels--completely. This is a new frame for the climate negotiations and it\u0027s revolutionary in its implications.Co-founder and Communications Director, 350.orgOn a day when I felt like we were the worst example of family... a day when I hoped no one noticed us... she did. But she didn\u0027t see what I assumed everyone was seeing. She didn\u0027t think what I assumed everyone was thinking. She saw beauty and love and hope and family.Founder and blogger, LaurenCasper.comWhen you see Hall on stage, he\u0027s full of piss and vinegar, but as he sits in his dressing room, barefoot and in jeans, a T-shirt and painted nails, he\u0027s reflective and gentle. He chooses his words so carefully that you can\u0027t help but hang on to every one.Worked as Associate producer, \u0027All My Children\u0027; journalist; contributor, Out.com and ABCNews.comWe intend to continue making documentary series and films and writing blogs about human rights.
