{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"From insidetheusa.netFrom wroctv.comA secret DoD database obtained by NBC News indicates that Pentagon intelligence and local law enforcement agencies are using the guise of the war on terror to keep an eye on the constitutionally-protected activities of anti-war activists. And, despite strict restrictions on the military maintaining records on domestic civilian political activity, evidence suggests the Pentagon is doing just that. With apologies to Buffalo Springfield: There’s something happening here… and what it is is painfully clear.
