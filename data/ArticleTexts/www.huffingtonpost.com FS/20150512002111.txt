{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoOf the 112 justices who have served on the Supreme Court from its beginning, only four were still on the Court at the age of 86. It therefore seems likely that we will see a substantial turnover on the Court over the course of the next decade. It will matter a lot who gets to fill those vacancies. This is so not only because presidents want to nominate justices who will reflect their own views of the law, but also because presidents have gotten quite good in recent decades at identifying nominees who will in fact reflect their own views of the law. Although justices may occasionally surprise and disappoint the presidents who appoint them, such \"mistakes\" have become increasingly rare.We\u0027re living in an age of where the emotional domino effect follows the slogan, \"Do unto others first, before they do unto you.\" Be the bully, lest you be the victim.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarOne of the lasting legacies of the George W. Bush presidency is that it severely lowered the bar on what we expect the president to know. Bush and mainly his primary handler, Karl Rove, made it generally acceptable for the chief executive to be no smarter than the great unwashed he\u0027s governing.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027It is already conventional to name the former party leaders Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg and Nigel Farage as the biggest losers of the British general election. But this is to understate the abject defeat suffered by some Keynesian economists, and in particular the Nobel prize winning former Princeton professor Paul Krugman.Laurence A. Tisch Professor of History at Harvard University; Senior Fellow of the Hoover Institution, Stanford UniversityLeaders from around the world, headed by Angela Merkel and François Hollande, have come together to try to make Putin listen to reason. Nothing has worked. Nadiya Savchenko remains a political hostage, or rather, a geopolitical hostage, in the hands of the master of the Kremlin.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.I have deep concern -- and some dismay -- when the president says that \"we are just wrong,\" or we are \"satisfied with the status quo,\" or worse, we are \"making this stuff up\" when we express concerns about the status of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade negotiations.Sandy Levin is the Ranking Member of the House Ways and Means CommitteeThere\u0027s a big political fight happening in Washington, but for once it does not break down easily along partisan lines. There are free-traders among both the Democrats and the Republicans, and opposition exists on both sides. But the main skirmish in this fight is currently happening between President Obama and some of his fellow Democrats.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comAll the elements that make NBA basketball such a beautiful thing -- the speed, the flow, the rhythm -- were erased for too much of Sunday’s game and replaced by a plodding, groan-worthy affair. It was, it must be said, worse than watching a baseball game.Senior Sports Editor, The Huffington PostAs our hearts ache, I can remember that for nine months, he grew within me. My heartbeat was his lullaby. He was safe, and he was already so loved. My body bears the signs and screams out he was here. He was here. He was here.Writer, Scribbles and CrumbsThe jump in the March trade deficit, coupled with the weak job numbers for the last two months, should highlight the importance of including rules on currency in trade agreements. Such rules could ensure that the dollar does not remain over-valued and prevent the economy from reaching full employment.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Brandon Rittiman and Kyle Clark are political reporters at KUSA-TV, the NBC affiliate in Denver, which says it has \"adopted a \u0027pro-fact\u0027 philosophy.\" I\u0027d love to see them go all pro-fact on Scott Walker, Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush, and on Hilary Clinton too, the way they did with Cory Gardner and Mark Udall in Colorado.USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorSHENZHEN -- Today\u0027s cities are not sustainable, no matter how we look at them. Here is an optimistic look at how we can turn challenges into opportunities, and create pulsating future cities.Principle investigator, Future Cities Laboratory, Singapore-ETH CentreThe Right Track approach eschews the simplistic, textbook understanding of free trade and recognizes that what \"free\" trade is now about is global governance: the harmonization of national regulatory regimes, often for the benefit of powerful corporate lobbies.Associate Professor of Law, Yale Law SchoolCould it be that no one is out there? Are we now free to declare ourselves the acme of brain power in this part of the cosmos, and certify that everything out to 50 million light-years is Klingon-free?Senior Astronomer, SETI InstituteThe Republican candidates\u0027 unwillingness to repudiate those promoting conspiracy theories about martial law and Jade Helm 15 makes clear that the extremist wing of their party is far, far more powerful than the nonexistent Sister Souljah wing of the Democratic Party ever was. Even the more serious candidates like Rubio, Walker, and Bush were afraid to denounce them.Author of \u0027Obama’s America: A Transformative Vision of Our National Identity\u0027Americans have become an insecure people. We grow more and more anxious about who we are, what we are worth and what life will be like down the road. This is an individual and collective phenomenon.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghThe DuPont proxy vote is a part of a battle for the soul of corporate America. The venerable Martin Lipton, quoted in Nocera\u0027s column, has it right: this form of shareholder value is \"a disaster for the country.\"Professor of Management Practice, Harvard Business SchoolA Jew, a Christian and a Buddhist tell about their lives as trans people, and invite new understanding of spirituality by presenting the deeply religious question: \"Who Am I?\"Executive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostThe best chance for a progressive agenda lies not in challenging Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination but in making sure she gets the White House, and then holding her accountable once she\u0027s there.WriterDespite continuing police brutality and persistent glass ceilings, this is a more accepting nation than it was a quarter century ago. We have more women and black CEOs, far more women and non-white professionals, an African American in the White House, who will very likely be succeeded by a woman. Same-sex marriage, once ridiculed, is increasingly seen as normal.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The life of a skeptic can be lonely. I used to wonder if something was wrong with me. As an adult, I now know this is just who I am, down to my bones. And honestly, I wish more people were like me. There, I said it. Now hear me out.Lawyer, mom, and writer (not in that order)Despite their long history of battering the U.S. middle class with bad trade deal after bad trade deal, these lawmakers and CEOs contend workers should believe that their new proposal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), will be different.International President, United SteelworkersI\u0027ve been thinking about email\u0027s death crawl. Surely it\u0027s on its way out as a daily communication tool, but the rate of its death seems to differ from person to person. Moving out of your head and your inbox, and into a more active communication with others is a healthier way to understand your relationships and the world.Likes getting people talking.* SF-based. *System-hacker, lover of footnotes.We are at a tipping point right now. The decisions and investments we make today will shape humanity\u0027s ability to thrive over the next 10 years and beyond.President and CEO, Heifer InternationalI don\u0027t believe this happened for a reason, but it has given us all a reason to be more present parents, more loving spouses, more supportive friends, and more caring leaders. The overwhelming sentiment from everyone who knew Dave is that he inspired us to be better human beings.Wharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027If there\u0027s anything to be learned from recent years, it is that, in fact, and contrary to what is bandied about, Europe is moving ahead much faster than we think. Six years of economic crisis has turned things around, often in irreversible ways, and we can expect even more progress in the coming months. Let me give three examples.France\u0027s Minister of FinanceMother\u0027s Day is about thanking moms for everything they do for their children. But I\u0027m also thankful for everything Democrats do for moms. As a society, we must be committed to empowering moms to make those tough decisions and to create opportunities for them to succeed.Author, \u0027For the Next Generation\u0027; Chair, Democratic National CommitteeIf fast track passes, TPP\u0027s passage is inevitable. The voting environment will be similar to what happened with the \"Citigroup budget\" vote, when the pressure was on members to pass it with provisions that deregulated derivatives or shut down the whole government.Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureYou get to suffer through me showing up at the park to make sure you\u0027re not mackin\u0027 it to some chick on the swings. And I know people don\u0027t say \"mackin\u0027 it\" anymore, but it\u0027s an awesome way to describe seriously weak pre-teen game.Blogger, writer, photographer, mom to and wife to some special Dudes.I asked for help for my family, as I felt it wasn\u0027t possible for us to slip much lower than we already were at, and His answer to me was that we still were able to help. To still love. To still be selfless. To still give. To still think of the needs of others. That there was still so much hurt, so much need, more so than what we were going through.Mother and writerIt might surprise you to learn that every year there are 1.5 million women living with HIV giving birth around the world. While every mom is different, we all share one thing: We want our babies to be given the healthy start in life they deserve.Actress, activist and motherGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"GOLDEN BOY GETS 4 GAMES",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
