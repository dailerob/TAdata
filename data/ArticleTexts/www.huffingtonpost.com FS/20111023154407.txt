El-Erian, 10/19/11CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOThe longer the policymaking impasse persists, the greater the stall-speed risk for an economy that already has an unemployment crisis, a large budget deficit, many underwater mortgages, and policy interest rates floored at zero.Read Post | Comments (97)Dylan Ratigan, 10/20/11Host, MSNBC\u0027s \u0027The Dylan Ratigan Show\u0027; Author, soon to be released \u0027Greedy Bastards\u0027I find it laughable to hear President Obama\u0027s spokesperson talking about how his campaign represents the 99%.Read Post | Comments (702)Conrad Black, 10/21/11Historian, publisher, authorMy admiration for Rupert Murdoch\u0027s boldness and acumen and our previous 25 years of more than civil relations make it unpleasant, despite his unspeakable assault on me, to have to conclude that he is deeply repressed and malicious man.Read Post | Comments (112)Marian Wright Edelman, 10/21/11President, Children\u0027s Defense Fund\"The Economy Stupid\" were the words on the now famous sign in successful presidential candidate Bill Clinton\u0027s 1992 war room.

Johnson, 10/17/11Entrepreneur, Philanthropist, FilmmakerWhat I\u0027m proposing isn\u0027t for the faint of heart.
