{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundChildren are not little adults. Adolescents are not the same as adults. We’ve known this for years. The research showing that their brains are still developing is clear. Although young people act on impulse, they have the ability to positively change and have a productive future. That’s why it’s outrageous that in the 21st century we still ignore the consequences of automatically funneling children into the adult criminal justice system against so much research on youth development and juvenile justice best practices. It’s bad for public safety and it’s bad for the youths and their families. It’s time for change.Comments (33)TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"What if the best way to help kids learn is to stop trying so hard to keep them safe? Hear popular TED speaker Gever Tulley\u0027s radical argument for letting kids play with power tools and other things that will make parents squirm.Comments (72)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, Beyond OutrageThe U.S. economy created a measly 74,000 new jobs in December, and a smaller percentage of working-age Americans are now employed than at any time in the last three decades (before women surged into the workforce).Comments (314)Randi WeingartenPresident, American Federation of TeachersWill the powers-that-be continue to be more concerned with creating a testing and data system that ranks and sorts schools and educators, in the quest for the perfect industrial algorithm to judge teachers, students and schools? Or will they look at the evidence and join educators, students and parents in fighting to reclaim the promise of public education?Comments (28)Lawrence LessigAuthor, \u0027Republic, Lost\u0027; Founder, RootstrikersI wanted to find a way to mark this day. I wanted to feel it, as physically painful as it was emotionally painful one year ago, and every moment since. So I am marking it with the cause that he convinced me to take up seven years ago and which I am certain he wanted to make his legacy too.Comments (17)Gordon BrownFormer Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationBy standing up to a terrorist, this extraordinary boy saved countless lives and should join the ranks of those whose actions define the word courage. This teenager thought his school important enough to defend and he had an instinctive sense that if the militants were allowed to destroy his school, they were taking away something valuable from his community.Comments (14)Kirk DouglasActorPope Francis is a man who wants us to understand each other no matter what our differences may be and to do our best to help one another. And that is the core of what every religion should be.Comments (79)Doug BandowSenior Fellow, the Cato InstituteNorth Korea is a great human tragedy. And we should hope that the next informal ambassador to the DPRK is someone less prone to inane outbursts. Nevertheless, Dennis Rodman is better than nothing.Comments (19)Claire McCarthy, M.D.Pediatrician, Boston Children\u0027s Hospital, Harvard Medical SchoolThere were lots of moments when I wished someone were there to help me. But because there wasn\u0027t, I learned resourcefulness. I learned self-reliance. I learned that if I stayed calm and used my head, I could find my way through just about anything. These are lessons I carry with me to this day--and that have served me very well.Comments (33)James ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027At this point we have no idea what US Secretary of State John Kerry is going to propose to the Israelis and Palestinians. Because no comprehensive peace agreement is within reach, we are told that the Secretary is working, instead, on a \"Framework Agreement.\"CommentsDr. Mae JemisonNASA astronaut, first woman of color in spaceThe word bothered me greatly years ago, as aviatrix, a feminization of aviator, seemed to make their accomplishments parenthetical. But I think of it differently these days as I understand the women of that era were different than the men -- they had to be \"more.\"CommentsJim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027The only way to win the War on Poverty is for liberals and conservatives to make peace -- for the sake of the poor. Making peace means replacing ideologies with solutions that actually solve the problems of poverty.Comments (149)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future\"Different\"? Christie embodies his party perfectly. Arrogant? Check. Bullying? Check. Indifferent to the well-being of constituents? Check. He may sound like a different kind of Republican, but he governs the same way the others do. Meet the new GOP, same as the old GOP.Comments (188)Frances BeineckePresident, Natural Resources Defense CouncilStriking a balance between wildlife conservation and wind energy development starts with understanding threats to eagle populations, and how our actions, including operating wind farms, are affecting them.Comments (61)Arianna HuffingtonBy bringing together people who work in a range of fields -- from media, health care and technology to music, fashion and poetry -- we want to open up the conversation around our need to redefine success.CommentsKen ReedSports Policy Director, League of FansAs a whole, our youth sports system is broken. As the country\u0027s performance culture increasingly focuses on the development of elite athletes at the youth sports level, our kids are burning out emotionally at a greater clip and at an earlier age.CommentsDr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholar-Ish is, no doubt, convenient, the drive-thru of adjectives. I\u0027ll give it that. But, like a steady diet of fast food, -ish, not used in moderation, will catch up to you.CommentsEmma GraySenior Editor, HuffPost WomenThe Tonya Harding-Nancy Kerrigan story played out like a Lifetime movie, and members of the media ate it up like tabloid candy. It had a catfight element that we love so much, and a class-war theme (even though Kerrigan also came from a working-class family): \"The Reigning Ice Princess Taken Down By The White-Trash Wannabe.\"Comments (12)Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoIn my judgment the existing metadata program is unconstitutional. As currently structured, it violates the Fourth Amendment\u0027s requirement of \"reasonableness.\" On the other hand, it should be possible for the government to correct the deficiencies in the program in a manner that both preserves its legitimate value and substantially mitigates the risks to privacy that it currently poses.Comments (29)Michael S. Broder, Ph.D.Psychologist; Author, \u0027Stage Climbing: The Shortest Path to Your Highest Potential\u0027Then comes what for most parents is the hard part - letting go and trusting that they will learn from their own mistakes, passions, uniqueness and psychological growing pains.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorPayrolls were up only 74,000 last month, the lowest job gain since January 2011 and suggestive evidence that the broader economic recovery has yet to reach the all-important job market.Comments (23)Charles F. Bolden, Jr.Administrator of NASAAt a time when women and minorities were rarely seen in the cockpit of an airplane, Amelia Earhart\u0027s pioneering achievements broke the silence barrier, inspired a nation and paved the way for so many others who have followed in her path.CommentsTavis SmileyPBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorAmong my guests was Greg Kaufmann, who writes about poverty for The Nation magazine. In the clip below, he shares his views about whether -- 50 years after President Lyndon B. Johnson declared War on Poverty -- there is anything President Obama can do to further the cause.CommentsRep. Chellie PingreeCongresswoman (D-ME)Earlier this week, John Boehner said he would only bring an extension of benefits to a vote under two conditions: spending cuts to pay for them and \"provisions ... to get our economy moving again and put Americans back to work.\" Sadly, the first condition is par for the course. But it\u0027s the second condition that really gets me.Comments (13)Eric BoehlertSenior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaChristie\u0027s coverage has been a long-running, and rather extreme, case of personality trumping substance. But now the bridge bombshell casts all of that flattering coverage into question.Comments (53)Ambassador Gianna AngelopoulosConvening Sponsor, Clinton Global InitiativeThere are 26 million young people in the developed world who are not currently employed, in school or in training programs, according to the OECD. Forget losing weight or exercising more: Our most important resolution for 2014 needs to be solving the youth unemployment crisis.CommentsSen. Richard BlumenthalU.S. Senator from ConnecticutCreated with the intent of making the league sustainable, blackout policies today punish fans rather than encouraging attendance. With the average NFL ticket costing about $80, many fans who have not recovered from the recession simply cannot afford to attend. It is time to improve the deal for fans.Comments (12)Carly PaulLiving in ColoradoThis is how I came to be in poverty\u0027s grip. It was not overnight, and it was not all because of me, and not all because a system that failed me, and not all because of a dysfunctional family, and not all because of overblown capitalism, and not all because of any one thing.Comments (265)Lance BassSinger, actor, producer, writer, entrepreneur and philanthropistFor my family, they still live in ground zero of intolerance for the LGBT community and have the unique pressure of having a well known gay relative. When I came out, they came out.Comments (312)Wray HerbertAuthor, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027What do dishonesty and wit have in common, that they so readily occupy the same mind? Does creativity lead to unethical behavior, or do cheating and lying spur the imagination? Is creativity just a socially acceptable form of violating norms and breaking the rules?CommentsThrillistWe\u0027re a quick, free, daily e-mail ...Some of it\u0027s actually pretty damn good, and could easily be sold as Nine-to-Eleven-Buck Chuck.Comments (17)Fernando Espuelas, 2014.11.01Lindsey Kesel, 2014.11.01Richard C.
