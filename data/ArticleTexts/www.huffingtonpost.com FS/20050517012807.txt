But let\u0027s not blame the messenger for violence prompted by reporting—even if that reporting turns out to be inaccurate.read whole post | permalink | author bio email this post to a friend05.16.2005 Danielle CrittendenOkay, for the ninth time we\u0027re really, really sorry for publishing a story that turned out to be inaccurate, and led to the deaths of 15 people and the injury of more than 60. Who knew we had more readers in Jalalabad than all of the continental United States?read whole post | permalink | author bio email this post to a friend05.16.2005 Cable NeuhausIn most of the other notable journalistic scandals of recent vintage no one died (unless you consider the sacking of New York Times exec editor Howell Raines like a passing in the family, but I doubt that).read whole post | permalink | author bio email this post to a friend05.16.2005 Jim LampleyThose of us who oppose this administration and its private $300 billion Iraq war are as saddened as we should be about the fourteen people who died in Afghanistan because of this story.

SimonLet\u0027s hope this Newsweek story was motivated by greed, because if it was motivated by a \"Get Bush\" ideology, this lifetime left-liberal who never dreamed of voting for a Republican for President until 2004, thinks their value system is mighty sick.read whole post | permalink | author bio email this post to a friend05.16.2005 Tavis SmileyThese days we\u0027re navigating politically more out of fear than hope. This constant peddling of fear is both counterintuitive and counterproductive.

Ginobili dunks in people\u0027s mugs. He dunks like Sprewell if Sprewell had a haircut like Richard Marx. And Steve Nash, the Canadian, has soul.

Anti-depressant use has \"soared over the past decade,\" carrying a doubled risk of suicidality. One in five American teenagers have used prescription painkillers to get high.
