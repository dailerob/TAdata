{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoThe \"conservative\" justices on the Roberts Court are often passionately restrained in their interpretation of the Constitution in precisely the cases in which a more muscular form of judicial review is most appropriate -- those involving discrimination against African Americans, women, Hispanics, religious dissenters, gays and lesbians, persons accused of crime, and denial of the right to vote to minorities and the poor. In these cases, our contemporary \"conservative\" justices often err on the side of upholding laws that even Philip Kurland would have found unconstitutional. This is, in my view, a sad state of affairs.It would be too easy to wash one\u0027s hands and blame politicians for their failure to address climate change. Any failure would be collective. Responding to climate change is everyone\u0027s responsibility.Jimmy CarterMary RobinsonThis will not be the last time someone discounts my son because he is different. It will not be the last time someone makes a joke at his expense, but to actively seek out actual people to tease goes beyond cruel. It\u0027s inhuman.Megan Davies MennesEnglish teacher, writer, motherWelcome to \"Game of Moans,\" the weekly recap of Game of Thrones Season 4 that highlights all the moan-worthy, gasp-filled, OMG moments that litter the Seven Kingdoms.Erin WhitneyHuffPost Fellow, TVExecutive Editor, Jill Abramson, is a front page story herself: After 160 years of men filling that prestigious post, Abramson broke the glass ceiling in 2011 with her landmark appointment, having spent her 35-year career at the Times and elsewhere as an investigative reporter, editor, bureau chief and Managing Editor.Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistIf the rate of return on wealth (r) is greater than the rate of growth (g), then wealth is likely to become ever more concentrated. This raises the obvious question of what can be done to offset this tendency toward rising inequality?Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027For more than 30 years, the right has been throwing long passes. The Democrats, with some fine individual exceptions in the Senate and House, have been playing an incremental game, eking out gains of a few yards at a time and often being thrown for big losses. Guess which side has been winning.Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Name five genuine interests you hold, other than food and weight loss. Seriously, five.

GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersLike single use plastic, words are too often disposed of without concern for consequence. It\u0027s important to understand that our actions have enormous impact on the world around us.Asher RothHip-hop artistThe omissions in the book are certainly egregious. But throwing Roberta Kaplan and Edie Windsor under the bus while comparing Chad Griffin to a woman who refused to sit at the back of the bus is truly horrendous.Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesYou had job interviews at a place you\u0027d like to work. The interviews seemed to go well. Maybe one of the interviewers said they looked forward to working with you. But, not a word from them since then.Susan P. JoyceEditor and chief technology writer, Job - Hunt.orgThe Wahhh, I Want Him Back Phase... I miss him. I want him back. I stress about our forgone actual plans. We were going to try that new risotto recipe. We have tickets to the Red Sox game next month. He was going to be my plus one at my cousin\u0027s wedding.Annelia AlexAcademic archaeologist and social bloggerHow can the nation\u0027s \u0027newspaper of record\u0027 be so seriously indifferent to or ignorant of the major education issue of our day?Diane RavitchResearch Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027Fifty years after the Civil Rights Act was signed into law, there are modern schemes to try and take away your vote.

Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkA team of astronomers, after carefully combing data from NASA\u0027s Kepler space telescope, has finally nailed a world that might be similar to our own. But is it inhabited? Finding the answer is not easy.Seth ShostakSenior Astronomer, SETI InstituteA new book that\u0027s the talk of academia and the media shows that two-thirds of America\u0027s increase in income inequality over the past four decades is the result of steep raises given to the country\u0027s highest earners.Bill MoyersManaging Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyStacey MorrisJournalist and food writer who dropped 185 pounds without dieting, surgery or miracle gimmicks.The relatively narrow wording Walmart has chosen for its policy suggests the company might not grant such requests if made by women with \"healthy\" pregnancies. This would be unfortunate -- and also often illegal.Deborah WidissAssociate professor, Indiana University Maurer School of LawI wonder if that is the irony of the whole thing: The young come in and take over for a brief moment, while we as their parents are glimpsing the last gasps of knowing what our kids are doing as we look ahead to the hill we are about to be over.Julie Bergman SenderDirector and ProducerWe all agreed, after some more snacks and wine for ourselves, that it had been fun to play these new games with our dogs, and that we\u0027d be likely to use them again. But we almost always enjoy playing with our dogs. Had the games been more than just fun?Arin GreenwoodEditor, HuffPost DCTthere is but one crime for which anyone in America\u0027s national security state can be held accountable in a court of law, and that\u0027s leaking information that might put those in it in a bad light or simply let the American public know something more about what its government is really doing.Tom EngelhardtEditor, TomDispatch.comThis November, Democrats will have chance to reconnect with ethnic voters and win support from them while still courting other key groups. It is not an either-or proposition.James ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027I realize that American politics is rife with dog whistling; there is plenty of code available to indicate which tribe is your enemy, and words like \"urban\" and \"Christian\" have long been acceptable ways to mobilize one side to put down another. But the American motto is e pluribus unum -- out of many, one.Marty KaplanUSC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorI don\u0027t want to give up on technology, it\u0027s part of my life, part of who I am. That said, I do want to make it work for me so that I can be a complete person.H.

The answer is emphatically no.Joan FeigenbaumBryan FordThere are many conflicts between science and basic Christian beliefs that are irreconcilable. Science is not likely to change to accommodate Christianity. If Christianity changes to accommodate science, it will be difficult to still call it Christianity.Victor StengerPhysicist, PhD, bestselling authorYou might assume that, four years after the spill, the U.S. would have implemented the safeguards and policies needed to prevent similar disasters.
