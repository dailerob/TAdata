{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, the two men who finished first and second in New Hampshire offered us a tale of two Republican parties. John Kasich\u0027s speech that night was the starkest contrast to Donald Trump\u0027s triumphant ugliness, scapegoating and division. \"We\u0027re going to solve the problems in America not by being extreme,\" he said, but by \"reminding everybody that we are Americans dedicated to shining up America and fixing our problems.\" He declared that we are all meant to be \"a part of the healing of this world.\" Kasich\u0027s speech was an alternate path forward for the GOP -- Trump\u0027s focused on our darkest fears, Kasich\u0027s on our better angels. As the campaign heads south, let\u0027s remember that presidential elections are about more than choosing the leader of the country. They are also about choosing what kind of country and people we want to be.If you think that we need a leader who will push to change the way we see the world then it makes perfect sense to imagine Bernie as the realistic candidate, the one who will get things done.Author of a dozen books, including \u0027The End of Nature\u0027 and \u0027Deep Economy\u0027Black people will not survive under the conditions of lovelessnesss in a market that is bolstered by black-on-black soul killing, amid a public generally amused, every time we annihilate one another.Senior correspondent at Mic and co-managing editor of The Feminist Wire.Our laws should be adapted to match how people live and love in the 21st century, filling in the many gaps left by the decline of marriage. The alternative -- continuing to treat longstanding partners and as if they count for nothing when one of them has a medical crisis, leaves, or dies, is unfair and brutally unkind.Psychotherapist; Executive/life coachWe may take a child out of an army, but unless we do more for him -- help him re-enter society, enroll him in a good school, teach him a useful trade -- we have not set him free. Unless we are there to meet them with open arms, open homes and open schools, their wars will never end. And neither will ours.Academy Award-winning ActorThe last Democratic debate showcased the kind of compulsive lying that makes Hillary Clinton unfit to be president. Clinton\u0027s role in Syria has been to help instigate and prolong the Syrian bloodbath, not to bring it to a close.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia UniversityThe Clintons are insiders now, their personal wealth of over $50 million derived nearly entirely from the wealthy and powerful. And it shows. Hillary\u0027s gradualism in health care carefully protects health-related industries. Her proposals for financial regulation do not include putting executives in jail, or confiscating the wealth they obtained by theft.Last summer, my wife went on a two-week trip to the East Coast to visit friends and family, leaving me home alone. I did miss her, of course, but what was with the pathological desire, nay NEED, other women had for me to verbalize it?Actor, writer, director and hand-talkerClinton still has a gap to traverse to lock in votes this primary season. She\u0027s already made significant changes to her campaign to change course and not repeat 2008. But schooling young women on what it means to be a feminist isn\u0027t going to win any votes.Host/Producer, HuffPost LiveWhatever our opinions of the candidates -- whatever we think of Trump or Cruz or Sanders -- whatever we think is wrong about our political system, we should all at least feel good that there is very little apathy in this campaign, and that it\u0027s bringing even young adolescents into the political conversation.CEO, William Morris Endeavor EntertainmentIt may be true that, as Hillary Clinton stated, \"One vote in 2002 is not a plan to defeat ISIS.\" But the real issue is whether or not Americans should entrust someone who helped facilitate the rise of ISIS with a plan to counter that threat.Author, \u0027Dangerous Ground\u0027The latest round of trash talking between GOP contenders Donald Trump and Jeb Bush has particularly focused on the other\u0027s mental health, if in an entirely juvenile sort of way. This, unfortunately, is the most common format in which mental health is referenced.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarWe are so committed to protecting Black masculinity and Black men. We rarely think about how vulnerable Black women and Black femininity are. Why are we more invested in protecting Black masculinity than we are in protecting ourselves from Black masculinity?Strategic partner and organizer with #BlackLivesMatterAssistant Professor of Women\u0027s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies at The Ohio State UniversityMost of us assume it\u0027s because someone, somewhere sat down with the scientific evidence, and figured out that cannabis is more harmful than other drugs we use all the time -- like alcohol and cigarettes. Not at all.The full spectrum of human relationships with drugsI fear that the new voters who see Bernie Sanders as their savior are coming to view the rest of the Democratic party and those of us who have long worked to achieve it\u0027s goals as the enemy.Actress, founding member of MOMENTUMBecause he\u0027s backed by the GOP establishment -- and apparently, because his backers view him, rightly or wrongly, as the only candidate who can court the extremes and still woo the middle -- many in the media proclaim him to be a moderate. But still, how is that possible?Queer Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostThere is more at stake here than the future of one author or one picture book. Most pressing is the question of whether we can ever reach a place in our society where questions of race can be openly and objectively discussed, especially with our children.Award-winning news reporter and cookbook author educated at Columbia University Graduate School of JournalismBernie Sanders is far too easy on Hillary Clinton in their debates. Clinton flaunts her record and experience in ways that Sanders could use to expose her serious vulnerabilities and disqualifications for becoming president.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorThere are so many levels to Formation that those of us who felt it, really feel it. There really isn\u0027t (that) much to joke about. Or waste time hating on.Director of Digital Media at GoodsperoThe gravitational disturbance that produced this history-making detection was apparently the result of two colliding black holes. That\u0027s not something you see every day. Yes, gravity waves are ubiquitous, but even the extremely sensitive instrumentation of LIGO is thoroughly unable to pick up these very local disturbances. It took a rare cosmic catastrophe to produce a space-time ripple large enough to be sensed.Senior Astronomer, SETI InstituteI never got drunk. I was just \u0027taking the edge off.\u0027 But I also recognized that reaching for a glass of wine, or three, had become my response to stress or sorrow in my life. And like most women I know -- most human beings -- there was generally plenty of that.Author and journalistWhile the United States has been distracted by Russia and the Middle East, China is quietly considering putting its nuclear arsenal on high alert. That could spell trouble.Senior Writer, Union of Concerned ScientistsThree months ago, my then-boyfriend, Craig, got down on one knee and asked me to marry him. I cried with excitement. After all, it was a huge moment in my life that was exceptionally exciting, special and celebration-worthy. But is it an accomplishment? No.Natalie Brooke, an Atlanta native, is the Vice President of Client Relationships for Resurgent Performance, a community bank advisory groupWhat I keep hearing is that more than outright hostility, a huge piece of the white church\u0027s complicity in America\u0027s original sin comes down to indifference to others. Indifference to the experience and sufferings of their black neighbors and even black brothers and sisters in churches -- including indifference to those \"prophets who cry out.\"Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersDiasporan dopeness won\u0027t let us quit. We are manifested from ancestral excellence and we cannot be outdone. Being conscious of Global Blackness is knowing that we are not an island of our struggle, but a nation of our triumphs. That\u0027s Blackness to me.Award-winning writer and digital strategist who thrives at the intersection of comedy, technology and activism.The chance to invite my friends and fellow artists to join me in ensuring that music people have a place to turn in times of financial, medical and personal crisis is deeply important to me for two reasons: it continues a long tradition of musicians giving back to help those in need, and it underscores the challenges faced by professionals who make music their lifelong focus, but who all too often do so at significant personal cost.Singer/SongwriterTrying to poach jobs across state lines is an expensive waste of taxpayer resources. Investing in making your state a great place to run a business, on the other hand... Now that\u0027s a smart idea.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributor34Justice co-founder and bloggerPresident Obama\u0027s recent speech to the Islamic Society of Baltimore was an attempt to reassure an American minority population feeling very much under siege. Yet Obama\u0027s own administration, and members of Congress, have taken actions in direct contradiction to the president\u0027s rhetoric.Policy Analyst for Homeland Security and Civil Liberties, Cato InstituteYou don\u0027t need more motivation. You don\u0027t need to be inspired to action. You don\u0027t need to read any more lists and posts about how you\u0027re not doing enough. There\u0027s a magic beyond us that works in ways we can\u0027t understand.Writer based in Los AngelesOf course candidates have to deny that they listen to Wall Street, and flatter voters into thinking ordinary people\u0027s opinions about high finance and economic fairness really matter. But of course most candidates also suppose that ordinary people don\u0027t understand banking and that bankers do.Professor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027We need to stop talking about dads like they\u0027re an inept accessory to parenting. Sure, there are plenty of deadbeat dads in the world. Equally, there are plenty of deadbeat moms. But the good dads need to be part of our language of parenting.Writer and motherGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day. Newsletters may offer personalized content or advertisements.
