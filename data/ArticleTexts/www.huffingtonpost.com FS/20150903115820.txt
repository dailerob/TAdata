{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Writer, Professor, Retired Lt. Colonel, Air ForceListen closely to America\u0027s leaders as they talk about helping Iraqis, Afghans, and other peoples. A common expression they use is training wheels, which they visualize themselves as affixing to or removing from the Iraqi or Afghan governmental bike. Because the idea of democracy is apparently so new and novel to foreign peoples, and because these foreigners basically act like so many children when it comes to governing themselves equitably, the U.S. must treat them like so many unskilled and tippy children on bikes. We must affix training wheels to their bikes of state, and at the proper moment -- a moment that only American adults can determine -- those training wheels must then be removed.By loving our kids, and loving them unconditionally, we\u0027re giving them an enormous advantage. That love is a private gift that stands entirely outside of money, position and power.Editor-at-Large and former Executive Features Editor of The Huffington PostI had been talking about how to get more sleep for a long time -- but really I was just complaining about being tired. I like being awake; my work, friends and family are compelling, and I\u0027ve always been willing to trade sleep for exercise.Vice President of People Development at GoogleMisinterpreting signals to make them consistent with a pre-determined outcome is, psychologists tell us, a common phenomenon in human nature. Unfortunately, it is also a frequent dynamic in modern financial markets, particularly when it comes to sustainability.Chairman, Generation Investment Management and The Climate Reality ProjectCo-founder and Senior Partner of Generation Investment ManagementIf you hope to be a good nurse (or coworker, or person with a heart), you\u0027re going to spend the majority of your working life doing things you SO mistakenly think are beneath you. The \"little\" stuff is rarely small. It\u0027s heavy and you can\u0027t carry it by yourself. So yes, little nursling, you are here to pass trays.If you\u0027re among the 82 percent who agree \"the system is rigged,\" the question is not what you think about my proposal in the abstract. The question is comparative: How does my proposal stack up to the proposals of others? Whose is more likely to succeed, and at what cost?Law professor, activist, possible candidate in the Democratic Primary for PresidentWhile the world\u0027s eyes were on Roanoke last week, this week most national and international media have made their exodus from this small community I now call home, and though their focus is on the next horrible breaking news story, it\u0027s as if time was frozen here. 8/26/15.Broadcast JournalistBrown didn\u0027t take responsibility for the mistakes of the past. His love letter to himself was about all of the ways he was wronged or misunderstood. His regrets seems to revolve around not more accurately predicting how the media and congressional investigators would spin his words, take what he said out of context, or lay blame at his door.Vice President, Strategy \u0026 External Affairs, The Bromwich Group. Views expressed are her own.Policymakers have recently sought to regulate the long shadow cast by social media slip-ups. In Europe and California, laws now exist that enable people to take digital erasers to their online activity, deleting stains we once considered permanent. But rather than empower individuals to purify their online personas, our culture needs to become more tolerant of a generation\u0027s habit to airs its flaws online.Blogs Editor, Huffington PostYo-Yo Ma\u0027s remarkable sounds emerge from a collaboration between him and his cello. We choose to view his contributions as more important. We don\u0027t view Yo-Yo Ma as mere facilitator of sounds produced by the cello. There\u0027s nothing that prevents us from granting the same kind of recognition to humans whose jobs require them to collaborate with computers.Author, The Sceptical Optimist: Why Technology Isn\u0027t the Answer to EverythingPart of the spirit of the age of networking and social communication is ending exclusion and the elitism of traditional pyramids of power. It is opening up a vast flat playing field of dialogue. This is exactly what the Arab world needs.President of Sharq Forum and former director general of the Al Jazeera NetworkKim Davis, as county clerk, is engaging her personal prejudices by refusing to issue marriage licenses to gay couples. That she claims her bigotry is religiously based is immaterial to whether or not she has to do her job.President, Moorfield Storey InstituteAmerica is \"treating\" mental illness through incarceration -- and the price we are paying as a country is enormous.Writer, Filmmaker, Actress - Brave New Films; The ProtologVice President, Impact JusticeWe cannot be held hostage to the theatrics of religious extremists, nor should we allow them to think that supposedly bad \"optics\" will deter us in demanding our rights.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostSweet teachers: school just started, and I\u0027ll bet you\u0027re wiped out and definitely a little lighter in the bank account; but I see you. I see how hard you\u0027ve worked before the first day of school even started. I see that you chose this job not to get rich or famous.Founder, Women With WorthGuaranteeing access to food and water as a universal right means guaranteeing a balanced development of the land in which agricultural and environmental resources are developed, preventing them from being taken away from the population and, as a consequence, impoverishing local economies and/or irreversibly altering local ecosystems.Vice President of the Senate of the Italian RepublicI\u0027ve found, now, that my greatest strength has come from embracing the intensity of my emotions and understanding where they come from. I understand, not only my own pain but the obligation that I have to the patients we serve. We cannot abandon them like so many of the people in their lives.Founder, Friend, Daydreamer, Gal\u0027s Gal, Puppy EnthusiastSomewhere down where we don\u0027t like to go, is a place where racism lives. It\u0027s automatic and hidden. Binding and resistant to change. No matter how well-meaning we are, no matter how open-minded. Like the \"root kit\" on a computer, racism is hidden and operating without our knowledge.Clinical Psychologist \u0026 Founder, Sachs CenterGovernor Brown\u0027s signature on legislation increasing the filing fee for citizens who file ballot initiatives from $200 to $2,000 is the modern equivalent of the famous salvo attributed to Marie Antoinette upon hearing of a famine among the French peasants, \"Let Them Eat Cake.\"President, Consumer WatchdogGiven the significant invasion of privacy occasioned by the use of drones by law enforcement, warrants should be mandatory before using them for surveillance. And weaponized drones of any sort should be outlawed.Professor, Thomas Jefferson School of LawOn September 5th and every day afterwards remember that there are no human rights that \"they\" are denied that \"we\" enjoy, be that defined by gender or geography. When it comes to humanity, we are them and they are us.Executive Director, A Woman’s NationWashington obviously intends sanctions to cause economic hardship, but for what purpose? In the early 1990s Khartoum supported Saddam Hussein\u0027s Iraq against America and dallied with Islamic radicalism, even inviting Osama bin Laden to stay. However, that practice ended after 9/11.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteWhile getting a child equipped for school is never a cheap date, for families who have a limited budget (or no budget at all) this time of year can be stressful, especially with a series of expensive holidays on the horizon.Author of Swiped. Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and IDT911The economic value of ecosystem services -- specifically nitrogen mineralization and biological control of pests -- could exceed the input costs of pesticides and fertilizers on the global scale, even if adopted on only 10 percent of farmland worldwide.President, Food Tank: The Food Think TankFood Tank ResearcherIn the five days the nation spent grieving Alison and Adam\u0027s deaths, 440 other Americans died by guns. And yet, as a nation we do nothing, except watch the special interest gun industry get away with murder without any accountability while their NRA shills buy and intimidate cowardly members of Congress.President, Meredith ManagementLately, I\u0027ve been hearing one phrase abused repeatedly, and it\u0027s worth a moment\u0027s reflection to consider its true meaning. That phrase is \"small sample size.\" I hear this phrase in every broadcast, every hour, before every hard stop for a commercial break.Senior Fellow, Justice Policy Center at the Urban InstituteWe\u0027re literally missing out on most our own lives, which leaves us feeling shallow, empty and deeply unsettled. The great news is you can learn to be more present and mindful. Here are 10 easy ways you can practice mindfulness in your daily life.Writer and life coach at NotesOnBliss.com, your guidebook to happiness and creating a beautiful lifeThere have been decades of decline and a parade of politicians promising help that never materialized. It\u0027s hard to believe in the future again after so much disappointment. On the other hand, the evidence of rebirth is overwhelming and economic optimism is necessary to make revitalization possible.Governor of New YorkI wanted to just whisper, please cherish that youth. Cherish it and celebrate it. Celebrate the true belief and comfort in watching your children grow, the ignorance of their own mortality.Just trying to complete this journey, but I keep losing my car keys and shoesYou might think that all foster parents are bad people. You might think that all foster parents are in it for the money. You might think that all foster parents don\u0027t care about the children in their homes. I am not that kind of foster parent.Leading expert in Parenting and Foster Care Field.In roughly the last 15 years, the same time period as the MDGs, we\u0027ve also seen the growth of the biggest advances in the fight against poverty, the power of good science. A year after a microloan program starts in a village, are the people there making more money than a similar village without the program? (Not as expected it turns out). Does giving cash grants which don\u0027t have to be repaid improve food security in Kenya? (Yes, significantly).Executive Director of Innovations for Poverty ActionGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
