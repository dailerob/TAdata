{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Children\u0027s Defense FundEach year at Halloween, our neighborhoods are bustling as children go door to door dressed as zombies, vampires, skeletons or something else fantastic and scary. For many children Halloween is the rare occasion to indulge in a fun time of ghost stories and goblins and trick or treats. But at the end of the night they put away their costumes and make-believe in their closets and return to their normal lives. Sadly, too many children do not have normal or safe or protected lives and their monsters are real. They do not have closets in many homeless shelters or on the streets or church steps where they sometimes live with homeless parents. They are not safe in drug- and violence-infested neighborhoods and suffer chronic hunger, especially on weekends and during long summer months when school is out.This is a crisis that is so vast, with needs so great, with potential consequences so dire, that no country can afford to stand on the sidelines.

It is well past time to join what is a historic, groundbreaking, lifesaving mission -- a noble mission.U.S. Ambassador to the United NationsWe need to make teachers feel respected and trusted.

Whether in departments, in groups, or in individual experts, the motivations were to keep information confidential and use it to gain an edge.

Close friends and family think nothing of lying in order to spare your feelings about as little as a poem. So they\u0027ll sooner tell you that your baby is ugly than that they didn\u0027t like the manuscript you\u0027ve agonized over for two years.WriterA break from the standard Halloween fare of mad slashers and paranormal infestations, the new film Horns brings a decidedly hometown slant to an examination of the good and evil that lives in all of us.Film journalistYou know, my parents serve our community too.
