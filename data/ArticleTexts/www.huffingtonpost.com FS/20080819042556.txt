{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIO\"How honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time \u0026 stay silent only when telling the truth might get us fired or earn us a broken nose?\" Those words were written by John McCain in his 2004 book Why Courage Matters. I couldn\u0027t agree with them more. I just wish John McCain did. Not the John McCain who wrote them in 2004; the John McCain running for president in 2008. There\u0027s a big difference. After Barack Obama finally secured the Democratic nomination over Hillary Clinton, we all thought it was down to a two-man field. Obama vs. McCain.
