{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week saw proof that the so-called \"Snowden Effect\" is still... in effect. The term refers to the increase of public knowledge and debate set in motion by Edward Snowden\u0027s leaks. The latest disclosure being that the NSA tapped Yahoo\u0027s and Google\u0027s international data centers. Last week it was the tapping of German Chancellor Merkel\u0027s cell phone. On Monday, Senate Intelligence Committee chair Dianne Feinstein said not only was she unaware of this, but so was President Obama. On Thursday, Secretary of State Kerry said the NSA had gone \"too far\" and was operating on \"automatic pilot.\" So not only is the \"Snowden Effect\" letting the public know what the NSA is doing, it\u0027s also informing the White House. The president says he welcomes debate with the public on the NSA. But how many more \"Snowden Effect\" revelations will it take before we can have a real debate on what is acceptable and what is not?Comments (93)Jon SoltzCo-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranHow is this even a debate? How is it that men and women who served in uniform get smeared as lazy and unmotivated to work, as soon as they need help feeding their families by using food stamps?Comments (928)TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"Cute, precious... brilliant? You bet. Behind that adorable facade, your baby is performing complex calculations in an effort to figure out how exactly this crazy world of ours works.Comments (65)Bill McKibbenAuthor of a dozen books, including \u0027The End of Nature\u0027 and \u0027Deep Economy\u0027As the battle over the Keystone XL pipeline has worn on -- and it\u0027s now well over two years old -- it\u0027s illuminated the Obama presidency like no other issue. It offers the president not just a choice of policies, but a choice of friends, worldviews, styles.Comments (286)Arianna HuffingtonIn this week\u0027s issue, Chris Kirkham takes an in-depth look at a private prison empire based in Florida. What he learns about the Youth Services International prison system is deeply disturbing.Comments (32)Rebecca SearlesSocial Community Editor, The Huffington PostMisusing the label and sounding like an idiot isn\u0027t good for anyone. So, I made a simple flowchart to make it easy on you.Comments (1,062)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027For many, the past few weeks have been discouraging, given the state of our politics and culture and what many vulnerable people across the country are experiencing. But despite the frustration and even grief sometimes I have been reminded of the importance of \"saving faith.\"Comments (189)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundFifteen-year-old Davion Navar Henry Only has spent his entire life in Florida\u0027s foster care system. He\u0027s been moved from placement to placement throughout his childhood. For some children like Davion, foster care can last an entire childhood.Comments (42)Martin ScorseseDirectorIt\u0027s impossible to separate the power of Dean\u0027s presence and his extraordinary impact on teenage viewers (like me) from the fact that his two key pictures were made in color and Scope, which was being used for the first time by Elia Kazan (in East of Eden) and Nick Ray.Comments (84)Danielle CadetEditor, Black VoicesThere is one really important thing black people don\u0027t do that a lot of white people seem to think is necessary: we don\u0027t paint our faces white when we dress up as a white person for Halloween.Comments (1,342)Paul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostRecently two celebrities offered us mirror textbook cases on how not to talk about the belief -- or lack thereof -- of another.Comments (1,541)Rep. Debbie Wasserman SchultzAuthor, \u0027For the Next Generation\u0027; Chair, Democratic National CommitteeIf we strive to understand the challenges that teachers face and empower them to improve flawed policy, we will get so much more from our investment in their salaries. Forcing teachers to compete against one another for better scores on a standardized test is not the way to improve education.Comments (308)Bill Moyers and Michael WinshipFox News is its ministry of misinformation, the fake jewel of the News Corp. crown, a 24/7 purveyor of flimflam and the occasional selective truth. Look at the pounding they\u0027ve given Obama\u0027s healthcare reform right from the very start.Comments (602)Amy ChanRelationship \u0026 lifestyle columnist, founder of www.JustMyType.caA boy is attracted to girls. A man is attracted to women. Now, this has nothing to do with the actual age of a person. I\u0027m referring to maturity, life vision and stage of life.Comments (386)Johnny JetTravel ExpertA few minutes after touchdown, we did indeed have a water canon salute, which I\u0027d previously only experienced on happy occasions like inaugural flights. This time, the water glistening on the windowpanes looked like tears.Comments (112)Alexandra RosarioBlog Editor, The Huffington PostPeople are downright fascinated when I tell them I\u0027m about to marry a chef. Celebrity chef culture is so pervasive in this country; chefs are today\u0027s new rock stars, wielding Japanese knives instead of electric guitars. It all looks so fun and glamorous. Right?Comments (28)Greg SavageLeader of the global recruitment industryWhy do people, invited for a dinner party at 7:30, think it\u0027s cool to arrive at 8:30? It\u0027s rude. It\u0027s inconsiderate. And it\u0027s selfish.Comments (2,095)Christine PelosiChair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusSimply put: blackface is unacceptable. Just don\u0027t do it. For those who say it\u0027s not about race, a thought exercise: what if a black man had dressed in \"whiteface\" as a white murder victim of a black defendant? Yes, you can imagine the FOX-fueled false equivalence hysteria from here.Comments (354)Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOBy maintaining an unchanged policy stance, the Federal Reserve delivered on consensus market expectations. The question now is: How long will this sustain the mix of financial conditions that the Fed and investors desire, and is needed to improve job prospects given the extent of Congressional dysfunction?Comments (96)Susan Katz MillerAuthor, Being Both: Embracing Two Religions in One Interfaith FamilyThis time of year, many interfaith families are preparing to feast on latkes, light Hanukkah candles at the Thanksgiving table and then move on to making Christmas cookies. But beyond holiday celebrations, is it a good idea to raise kids in two religions?Comments (90)Russell SimmonsFounder, GlobalGrind.comMy question for you, New York Times, is how can you allow such strong voices such as corporations that promote war, destroy the environment, lobby for assault weapons, etc., and yet take issue when those that fight for animals give them a voice?Comments (43)Cara PaiukAuthor, mother, and entrepreneurAs an expectant mom or new mom, you have seen this list in some form before.

There is an interesting new article by Rosenthal and collaborators in the latest issue of the journal Science entitled \"Pacific Ocean Heat Content During the Past 10,000 Years\" that attempts to address this question.Comments (979)Kimberly K. Arcand and Megan WatzkeWe\u0027ve put together a group of our favorite selfies of someone that could actually use more face time: Mother Earth.CommentsSen. Bernie SandersIndependent U.S. Senator from VermontAs a member of the U.S. Senate Budget Committee, I am more than aware that a $17 trillion dollar national debt and a $700 billion deficit are serious problems that must be addressed. But I am also aware that real unemployment is close to 14 percent.Comments (359)Brett GallaherFounder, WeOccupyJesus.orgJesus would send out an emergency text to his homegirls to come rescue him. He\u0027d stall in the meantime: \"Mark, I\u0027m really flattered that you\u0027ve devoted your entire ministry to me. That means a lot. Tell me more about what attracted you to Christianity.\" Mark would lean over and whisper two words in Jesus\u0027 ear: \"Real. Men.\"Comments (44)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarWhile women started to change the workplace in the \u002770s, it\u0027s only been since the \u002790s that their presence has gained real mass. As their numbers grow, assumptions about what they want and even who they are start to look as relevant as carbon paper.Comments (81)Michael KimmelAuthorRemember Howard Beale? Played by Peter Finch in the movie Network (1976), the deranged former TV news anchor Beale tries to generate a social movement by admonishing viewers with a simple sentiment: \"I\u0027m mad as hell and I\u0027m not going to take it anymore!\"Comments (1,075)Paul PolmanCEO, UnileverClimate change is sometimes misunderstood as being about changes in the weather.
