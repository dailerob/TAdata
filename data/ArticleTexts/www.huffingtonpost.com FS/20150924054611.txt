President, Writers Guild of America, East.The funniest line of the last few days came from Arizona Republican Congressman Paul Gosar. Resentful that Pope Francis might blaspheme the sacred chamber of the World\u0027s Greatest Deliberative Body with some inconvenient truth about global warming, Gosar announced he would boycott the Holy Father\u0027s visit to Capitol Hill. You can argue that a joint session of Congress is an inappropriate speaking venue for a world religious leader, violation of church and state and so forth. And many of us have big, big issues with the Roman Catholic Church. But frankly this is no time for business -- or politics -- as usual.No one should be allowed to profit from putting more people behind bars -- whether they\u0027re inmates in jail or immigrants held in detention centers.

It has not only revolutionized the form, but it is the best history teacher I could ever want. It makes me want to be young again and able to see history through its eyes.Actress and children\u0027s book authorFailing to recognize Syria\u0027s crisis as fundamentally political and military in nature has led to a complete shortfall of ideas aimed at resolving it. Instead, governments across the world have substituted humanitarian assistance and refugee resettlement in place of concerted political actionBritish-Syrian doctor in anesthesia and intensive careExecutive Director, Physicians for Human Rights (PHR)The Pope\u0027s call for the wealthiest nations in the world to accept those fleeing poverty and violence directly contradicts the majority party\u0027s view, but gives spiritual power to the quest for immigration reform that lives up to our values.Co-chair, Congressional Progressive Caucus; U.S. Representative for Minnesota\u0027s 5th DistrictFew Americans realize that the Pope\u0027s recent encyclical on the environment is one of the most articulate and accessible presentations of why there is scant chance to avoid environmental disaster unless we radically transform our global economic and political order.So we\u0027re down to the paltry number of \"only\" 15 Republican candidates for president, as Scott Walker has now joined Rick Perry on the sidelines of the race.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comIn accordance with its legal and moral duty, the United States should step up to the plate and welcome significant numbers of refugees.Professor, Thomas Jefferson School of LawThe Band -- which released its eponymous masterpiece 46 years ago this week -- brought a swollen heart and a down-home groove to the rock n\u0027 roll landscape that was unprecedented at its time.Blog Editor, Huffington PostAt a time where most of the major music festivals are seriously lacking in diverse talent, Riot Fest somehow managed to showcase one of the year\u0027s more varied and unusual collections of musicians despite (or perhaps because of) its punk-centric ethos.Senior Editor, What\u0027s Working, The Huffington PostIt\u0027s a difficult trip to make for a Pope who is not familiar with America. It is also difficult for Americans, who are in large part struggling to understand the Pope, his language, his background, and his non-sectarian vision for Catholicism.Professor of History of Christianity, University of St. ThomasSanders has shown since Netroots Nation that he understands that reality by addressing both areas where race and class intersect, as well as those where racial injustice inflicts harm irrespective of class.Author of \u0027Obama’s America: A Transformative Vision of Our National Identity\u0027The GOP\u0027s Incoherent Rage About the Pope; Religious Hypocrisy; Obama Bowed to the Pope; The GOP of 1980 versus the GOP of 2015; Worst Person in the World; and much more.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027Maher in this case is not. What he and his strange bedfellows are promoting is way more dangerous to democracy than Islam could ever be. Religious extremism will not destroy America. But it\u0027s not fear of religion that will ultimately defeat religious extremism, either.Humanist, Progressive, BAMFWe usually think and talk about peace as the absence of bad things. Peace is a lack of war. Peace is a lack of violence. But true peace isn\u0027t just the absence of bad; it is the presence of good.Academy Award-winning ActorEven though we now know from good science that exercising baby and infant brains changes lives in extremely positive ways, we have not shared that information in any effective way with the parents and the families who really need to know that information at the point in time when it can create a major benefit for their child.Chair and CEO Institute for InterGroup UnderstandingI hope that world leaders attending COP21 will listen to Pope Francis, act with courage and conviction and emerge from the conference with an agreement that, in the words of the Pope, \"protects our common home.\"Founder and Chair, Bianca Jagger Human Rights FoundationMental illness can emerge within anyone, this includes those champion athletic gladiators of sport.
