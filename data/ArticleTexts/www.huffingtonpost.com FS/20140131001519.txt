{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jason LinkinsEditor, Eat the PressWhat was going on with MSNBC last night? One can only speculate. In all likelihood, whoever made the initial tweet about the Cheerios ad may have had an earlier story on their minds as they composed it. Back in June 2013, Cheerios put out a commercial featuring a mixed-race family, which took a dark turn after it drew \"a host of ugly remarks online.\" The story drew national attention, so it\u0027s easy to see how one might recall the incident when a new Cheerios commercial with a similar theme becomes available. And had MSNBC simply tweeted, \"Maybe the racists will hate it...\" this would have never evolved into a shooting war with the RNC, an organization that represents \"the right wing\" institutionally. But this is part of the new way we manufacture outrage by combing social media networks for ignorance and then blowing up the perpetrators as somehow representative of larger institutions.Comments (151)David CoatesWorrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University, Department of PoliticsFine rhetoric well delivered, mildly progressive goals modestly pursued, and a strong statement of the continuing importance of American exceptionalism and American power. But just because a president cannot do a full and honest stock-taking of our overall condition, that doesn\u0027t mean that we shouldn\u0027t.CommentsAdam GrantWharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027What makes a job meaningless? After more than 40 years of research, we know that people struggle to find meaning when they lack autonomy, variety, challenge, performance feedback, and the chance to work on a whole product or service from start to finish.Comments (40)Anne SinclairEditorial Director, Le Huffington PostThere won\u0027t be any photos on today\u0027s HuffPost France homepage: only beautiful, surprising and innovative illustrations.CommentsDax ShepardActor, director, and writerA few days ago my wife and I wrote tweets urging folks to boycott publications that buy photos of celebrities\u0027 children without the consent of their parents. We got a myriad of responses, ranging from heartfelt solidarity to vitriolic rage. Now, against the advice of my better half, I am going to address some of those Twitter detractors.CommentsTaylor HirthChildren\u0027s advocate and motherI have composed this sample buget. It accounts for the things that many people expect lower income families to maintain, and maintain without public assistance. It doesn\u0027t account for saving for college for our children, saving for retirement, or saving for much of anything at all.Comments (143)Maria ShriverAward-winning journalist, best-selling author and activistFor too many American women, the dream of \"having it all\" has morphed into \"just hanging on.\" This is not about handouts. This is about smart economic policy. Working women are the core of our economy. Leave them out and you don\u0027t have a robust economy. Lead with them and you do.Comments (22)Ellie SleeOne third of ThingsWeWish.comBeyonce: when you smile affectionately and sing along with that lyric, you are propagating a cycle of humiliation, of rape, of violence that is still horrifically real for women all over the world.Comments (201)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorToday\u0027s minimum wage is 22 percent below its late 1960s peak, after adjusting for inflation. Raising it to the $10-an-hour range would help to offset some of the unfavorable trends facing low-wage workers, including stagnant or falling real wages and inadequate bargaining power that leaves them solidly on the \"have-not\" side of the inequality divide.Comments (230)Andrea KingScreenwriter living in Los AngelesYesterday morning, while driving my son to preschool, I turned on KPCC and heard Mayor Garcetti in the midst of talking about someone. All I heard was, \"... he was literally the most universally liked man in Hollywood,\" and I knew that Tom Sherak had died.CommentsKadia BlagroveCultural writer based in NYC.Because I was directly in front of her, I had no choice but to twerk in her face. Over the course of the next hour, I felt her despair turn into resentment and then contempt. I just knew for sure that it was directed toward me and my booty.CommentsAllen FrancesProfessor Emeritus, Duke UniversityWhy does MPD keep making its periodic comebacks, despite not being a verifiable or clinically useful mental disorder? My best guess is that the labeling of \u0027alters\u0027 offers an appealing and dramatic metaphor, an idiom of distress.CommentsCherie BlairFounder, Cherie Blair Foundation for WomenIt is absolutely vital that women have role models and support one another. But this has to be a two-sided conversation. We need to recognize where powerful men are taking action and work together to move the debate forward.CommentsRichard (RJ) EskowSenior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host, Take Action NewsBuilding that economy begins with preventive measures. The last bank-fueled crisis robbed the nation of millions of jobs and trillions in wealth. Preventing the next crisis means stronger financial regulation, a breakup of the big banks, and rock-solid walls between customers\u0027 money and bankers\u0027 gambling funds.CommentsThomas E. PerezU.S. Secretary of LaborIncreasing the minimum wage is part of the president\u0027s vision of opportunity for all, a fair chance to get ahead if you\u0027re willing to work hard. It will help families and it will help businesses. It\u0027s the right thing to do and the smart thing to do.CommentsAinissa G. Ramirez, Ph.D.Materials Scientist; Author \u0027Newton\u0027s Football\u0027The cold temperatures for this Super Bowl might not be polar-vortex-like temperatures, but they will certainly change the dynamic of the game in several ways compared to the warmer temperatures of Super Bowl games played indoors or in more temperate cities.CommentsHolly L. DerrFeminist media critic, writer, rabble-rouserOnly two of the nine films nominated for Best Picture are genuinely about women, and the difference in how women\u0027s bodies are treated in those films versus the other seven is telling.CommentsRobert NaimanPolicy Director, Just Foreign PolicyBy claiming to support a two-state solution while helping to bolster the occupation, Scarlett Johansson is acting as a Susan Collins for the occupation, pretending to be moderate, while acting to bolster extremists.CommentsJennifer RiveraMezzo sopranoSome people seem to have a problem with the fact that there\u0027s an opera singer singing the National Anthem at the Super Bowl. So here are several pieces of information you should know about opera before you see Renee Fleming belt out the national anthem Sunday.Comments (25)James MooreBest selling author, TV political analystCandidates need to talk -- especially candidates that are considered the underdog. Wendy Davis ought to be running toward reporters, not away from them. Don\u0027t exercise control; exercise honesty and complete openness.CommentsEllen Dorsey and Richard N. MottThis week, a student-led climate movement got a powerful new ally. Seventeen philanthropic foundations with combined assets of two billion dollars, took the extraordinary step of publicly announcing their decision to divest from fossil fuels and invest part of their assets into a clean energy economy.CommentsAlexandra RosarioBlog Editor, The Huffington PostIn a smidge less than four months, I\u0027ll be a married lady. So far, in the past year of planning my spring wedding, I\u0027ve learned more than just what kind of flowers and colors I do or don\u0027t like -- I\u0027ve learned a few things about myself along the way too.CommentsBrenda Della CasaAuthor, \"Cinderella Was a Liar\"; Owner \u0026 Editor-In-Chief: Staggered Magazine, Editor-In-Chief, Preston Bailey Designs; Founder \u0026 Editor-In-Chief: Life In Style www.bdclifeinstyle.com21. Know when -- and how -- to apologize. Don\u0027t be sorry she felt that way, be sorry you did it.Comments (32)Ted Danson and Andrew SharplessIt\u0027s not often that someone can make a philanthropic investment that simultaneously fights climate change, biodiversity loss, and world hunger. But Michael Bloomberg is doing just that.CommentsAdam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911If it\u0027s going to be legal, small business owners who sell it should have the same access to the financial system (and the protections that system provides them) as any other small business owner in America.CommentsGavin ShulmanWriter, ProducerYou want a human interest story? To give you a reason to watch? Shut up. This isn\u0027t the Sochi Olympics. It\u0027s the Super Bowl. If you\u0027re still looking for a reason to watch then you probably shouldn\u0027t. In fact, you\u0027d be a lot more interesting of a human if you didn\u0027t. But you\u0027re going to.CommentsRep. Debbie Wasserman SchultzAuthor, \u0027For the Next Generation\u0027; Chair, Democratic National CommitteeA raise of the federal minimum wage is one of those common-sense proposals that is both good for the economy and good for the country. Considering there has not been an increase since July 2009, workers who depend on these wages have been losing income to inflation for over four years. A raise is long overdue.Comments (49)Barbara BrunoNFL Analyst and Commentator, Independent Film Producer, Non-Profit Grant WriterThis Sunday, for the third time in the recent Super Bowl era, the NFL\u0027s best offense will face the league\u0027s best defense. In the previous two instances, the top defense won -- rather famously so.CommentsMichael MooreOscar and Emmy-winning DirectorIn the State of the Union tonight, President Obama is going to call for a national minimum wage of $10.10. Then the Republicans will say that\u0027d be a huge disaster that would make the Washington Monument fall over, Mt. Rushmore explode, etc. But here\u0027s what neither will tell you.Comments (683)Paul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostIn the end, good news porn can be like sexual porn in that there is no real commitment, engagement or sacrifice involved. Good news is presented for our enjoyment, and when we are done, we can move on without any thought for those whose lives we just consumed.CommentsEllen CantarowBoston-based journalistGas fracked from shale formations goes by several names, but whatever it\u0027s called, it\u0027s mainly methane. Fracked gas helps to fuel the floods, hurricanes, droughts, wildfires, and ever-hotter summers that are engulfing the planet. Methane is a far more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide and an ecological nightmare due to its potential for dangerous leaks.CommentsBarbara Borst, 2014.30.01TueNight, 2014.30.01John Shore, 2014.30.01Ainissa G.
