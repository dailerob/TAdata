{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"The narrow survival of the Affordable Care Act last week was certainly cause for celebration. But as the jubilation subsides, it\u0027s important to realize that having avoided what would have been a giant step backward doesn\u0027t mean we\u0027ve taken a giant step forward. Because the law as it now stands is only the first step toward health care reform. We now need to focus on cost containment and prevention -- neither of which the Act adequately addresses. We need to continue to think big. In the weeks leading up to the ruling, we read a lot about the sense of urgency and alarm and resolve that health care advocates would have if the Act were struck down. Now that it\u0027s been largely upheld, we need to keep -- and build upon -- that sense of urgency.Read Post | Comments (74)Norman Lear, 07/03/12Founder, People for the American WayMy love for and devotion to our country goes back to incidents in my childhood, my service in World War II, and my involvement since 1980 in fighting those who would have us believe that people are good Christians or bad ones depending on their political points of view.Read Post | Comments (13)David Wild, 07/03/12TV Writer; Contributing Editor, Rolling Stone; Co-Author, \u0027Diary of a Player\"\u0027It is worth remembering today that Griffith\u0027s influence extended powerfully into the music.
