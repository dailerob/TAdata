{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Derek ShearerProfessor of Diplomacy at Occidental College and former US ambassadorOf course, there is no shortage of weighty issues for Obama and Xi to discuss when they meet at the Sunnylands retreat on June 7th and 8th. But both countries would gain from an expansion of cooperative green activities. The US and China are the leading emitters of greenhouse gases, and only a joint effort between the two will provide real solutions to global warming. The costs to the US in weird and extreme weather alone are evident in Oklahoma and the Jersey Shore. And pollution is one of the most pressing problems facing Xi and China\u0027s ruling elite. Rapid economic growth has come at the cost of the health and safety of the Chinese people with fouled air, polluted lakes and rivers and poisoned food supplies. Environmental issues are the leading cause of public outcry and demonstrations. The cost to China of environmental damage has been measured in the hundreds of billions of dollars.Comments (33)Mike HoganExecutive Arts and Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post Media GroupI can\u0027t decide if I envy or pity those of you who didn\u0027t know what was coming in this episode ... In truth, knowing that the episode would end the way it did cast a pall over everything that came before.Comments (620)Lewis LaphamEditor of Lapham\u0027s QuarterlyNothing in the sea lives by itself, nothing either on the earth or in the air or in the minds of men. To know the sea is mortal is to know that we are not apart from it.Comments (24)Bella Ellwood-ClaytonSexual Anthropologist, AuthorWhat is the true nature of female sexuality? When it comes to women\u0027s priorities, why, once in a secure relationship, is sex no longer on top?Comments (608)W. Kamau BellComedian, Host of Totally Biased on FXCould it have been better? Sure? I certainly could have done a better job of playing traffic cop. But it was exactly what I wanted it to be: a well-mannered, intelligent, often funny, and always impassioned discussion about a sensitive and charged issue that you rarely see on TV.CommentsHRH The Prince of WalesHRH The Prince of WalesThere is a growing set of alarming problems which, if not addressed with real urgency, will severely affect nature\u0027s capacity to keep her life support systems running and thus guarantee the well-being of billions of people around the world.Comments (293)Murray LippSocial justice activistAs two major Supreme Court decisions about same-sex marriage (Proposition 8 and DOMA) loom on the horizon, it\u0027s an opportune time to refocus attention on the many advantages associated with the pursuit and achievement of marriage equaility.Comments (478)Chelsea ClintonBoard Member, Clinton FoundationNow, Cambodia is uniquely placed to be one of the first countries to eliminate new pediatric HIV infections, and through collaborative partnerships, I have no doubt Cambodia will be able to reach its goal.CommentsNorman LearFounder, People for the American WayCan I reach deeply enough inside me now to express how much that, the idea and Jean Stapleton herself, has meant to me?Comments (182)Allen FrancesProfessor Emeritus, Duke UniversityThis past month has been disastrous for mental health. One embarrassment has followed another -- leading to a crisis of confidence that is potentially dangerous for those who rely on psychiatric care.CommentsMariska HargitayAdvocate, Emmy Award Winng Actress on Law \u0026 Order: SVU, Founder \u0026 President of the Joyful Heart FoundationDespite the progress we as a nation have made in the movement to end sexual violence, including the recent passage of a more inclusive Violence Against Women Act, much work remains to be done.Comments (24)Cynthia Germanotta and Robert RossWe believe there is a need for a new narrative, a new strategy, and new tools to construct more inviting and welcoming pathways into mental health treatment. The millenials and younger generation will drive badly needed \"new rules\" on de-stigmatizing mental illness.CommentsSean PennAcademy Award-winning Actor; Ambassador-at-Large for HaitiFive months have passed, more than twenty Bolivian government officials connected with the extortion network that first imprisoned Jacob Ostreicher have been arrested or are on-the-run, and yet Jacob remains a captive of the Bolivian Judiciary.Comments (26)Angie HicksFounder and Chief Marketing Officer, Angie\u0027s ListMany homeowners strive for the perfect, emerald-green lawn, which often means that their lawn mower suffers considerable use and abuse. And without regular, preventive maintenance, there\u0027s a good chance an overworked lawn mower will sputter out just when you need it most.Comments (15)Leo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersRepublicans have abused the filibuster process at a record rate. They\u0027ve manipulated Senate recess to unprecedented levels. They\u0027ve delayed and appealed decisions. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid can hobble this right-wing campaign against working people by deploying the nuclear option.Comments (81)William BradleyPolitical Analyst, NewWestNotes.comThe latest episode in this most uneven of Mad Men seasons, \"A Tale of Two Cities,\" was actually a good one. Coming just a week after the least viewed episode since 2009, and just as I was thinking it might be time for a pithy 400 or 500 words on the show jumping the shark, it was a welcome arrival.CommentsJon HotchkissCreator, ThisvsThatShow.comTurns out there are quite a few scientific factors at work that will determine whether your Coke goes flat upon pouring or remains refreshingly carbonated.Comments (25)Geoffrey FletcherScreenwriter, \u0027Precious\u0027It feels as if we\u0027re constricting the boundaries of mainstream art instead of pushing them. In a risk-averse environment where many people fear for their jobs, \"nothing ventured, nothing lost\" is the prevailing sentiment, but it is also a recipe for mediocrity at best.CommentsDr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarIf you believe the surveys -- and parse all they commentary they create -- successful working women must find balance, as they lean forward, peering up at the glass ceiling, looking over their shoulders at coming competitors in an environment that is not nearly as sisterly as we assumed.Comments (69)Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoThe usual liberalism of the Black Caucus in Illinois apparently does not extend to protecting the equality rights of gays and lesbians. The explanation for this apparent puzzle seems to rest less in the views of the legislators than in the politics of religion in the African-American community.Comments (637)Pilar GerasimoExecutive Editor, Healthy Living, The Huffington PostI am not sure if they fell out in a chunk, or gradually, one at a time, but one day, I was looking in the mirror and I noticed there was a major gap where probably a dozen eyelashes had once been. This was not good.Comments (14)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorNeither China, nor any other country, has unlimited financial resources. Finite resources are, in fact, the core principle of economics. When you tee up the problem that way, you risk missing the actual problem, which is a combination of state power and the savings imbalances noted above.Comments (179)Wendell PotterAuthor, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgNo doubt President Obama regrets saying, with equal bravado: \"If you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan.\" That was just plain stupid.Comments (150)Sec. Kathleen SebeliusSecretary of Health and Human ServicesSmart policy can be instrumental in removing obstacles to innovation. And we\u0027re now seeing the same pattern play out across the health care system.Comments (14)Lauren ZalaznickPresident, NBC Universal Women and Lifestyle Entertainment NetworksSome things, like soufflés, holes-in-one, and probably rocket launches require perfection. If and when I change careers, maybe my quest will re-emerge.CommentsJordan SchultzThe Huffington Post\u0027s sports columnist, The Schultz ReportConsider that Hibbert makes $4 million less than Bosh this season and at one point during their respective contracts, will make $7 million less. Make no mistake: This is absolutely a slight to Bosh, who is Miami\u0027s highest paid player and perhaps its biggest conundrum as well.Comments (16)Mark Hyman, MDPracticing physicianThe path to energy, to well-being is not far for most of us -- it is a few bites of food, a few steps, a few moments of rest away. It is disarmingly simple, yet even the best and the brightest among us often fail to make the connection between how we treat our bodies and how we feel.CommentsBlake KernenA 7th grader from Morristown-Beard School, New JerseyI can think of dozens of reasons why I do community service or volunteer work, the biggest being that it helps others, and I can\u0027t think of any reasons why I wouldn\u0027t. So here are five reasons why a person should get involved with community service or volunteer work.CommentsSteven StraussAdjunct Lecturer in Public Policy, Harvard Kennedy SchoolInnovation is the buzz word du jour. But presenting it as an obscure unmeasurable esoteric art does not make it easier. Definition and measurement matter, as Peter Drucker observed: \"If you can\u0027t measure it, you can\u0027t manage it.\"CommentsValerie JarrettSenior Advisor and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsIf you are willing to be flexible, you will find your true passion. So don\u0027t restrict your options, and limit your potential, with arbitrary, self-imposed deadlines. But be ready to push yourself beyond your comfort zone, and to be resilient.Comments (69)James MooreBest selling author, Director of Progress Texas PACThe scientists try to get close enough to determine the funnel\u0027s path and then set instruments in front to see if they can gather data that may one day help predict formation and, as a consequence, save lives. But what about the news crews? Why are they taking these risks?CommentsCynthia Germanotta, 2013. 3.06Jennifer Cullen, 2013. 3.06XPRIZE, 2013. 3.06Shannon Sutherland, 2013. 3.06Erin Havel, 2013. 3.06Susan Bulkeley Butler, 2013. 3.06Bitchless Bride, 2013. 3.06Elischia Fludd, 2013. 3.06Molly Lindquist, 2013. 3.06Jim T.
