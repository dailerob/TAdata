{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressIt seems pretty clear that the possibility that an Ebola-related travel ban will be imposed in the near future is growing with each passing day. Those who provide informed expertise about this sort of thing advise against such a policy. Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, calls the notion \"a solution that\u0027s quick, simple, and wrong.\" The White House currently holds with the CDC on this regard. These positions haven\u0027t been taken in some information vacuum. In fact, the case against a travel ban is very compelling. But travel ban fever appears to be implacable.It is important for everyone to become more savvy about abuser\u0027s excuses because many people unwittingly reinforce them in how we respond to the abuser\u0027s \"explanations\" for his/her violence, and to understand what taking real responsibility means.Psychologist, and Co-Founder and Co-Director of Emerge, an abuser education program and national training center on domestic violenceYou can\u0027t just expect any nurse or any doctor or any health care worker or layperson to understand the deconning procedures by way of some kind of pamphlet or 10-minute training video. Not only is it mentally rigorous, but it\u0027s physically exhausting. Writer and healthcare scientist.America goes to the polls in less than 3 weeks, there\u0027s a lot at stake for the majority of voters -- namely women. Unfortunately women also make up another majority -- those working for our pathetic $7.25 an hour minimum wage.Money Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsIn their haste to exploit public fears over Ebola and whip up anti-Obama sentiment for the midterms, right-wing Republicans and commentators have been competing to see who can come up with the craziest theory to explain why the Obama administration hasn\u0027t yet followed their brilliant travel ban advice.Activist and political blogger at LatestOutrage.orgI still love listening to albums -- however threatened the album itself may be in today\u0027s music world. So from time to time I think, wouldn\u0027t it be nice to support musicians far and wide by sharing with you some of my own current pet sounds here -- the new music I\u0027m listening to today?TV Writer; Contributing Editor, Rolling Stone; Co-Author, \u0027Everybody\u0027s Brother\u0027Islam today is being cannibalized by cancerous strains of fundamentalist religious ideologies that are promoted by wealthy and powerful Middle Eastern countries extinguishing moderate hopes in the Muslim world.Many of these countries are considered American and Western allies.Author of \u0027The Secret Sky\u0027 and foreign correspondentEasy talk about \"boots on the ground\" grates on the senses. It seems an awfully cavalier way to talk about the American battle dead buried at Arlington and in cemeteries across the country.Senior Military Correspondent, The Huffington PostI want people to understand that we are more than the latest breaking news. We are not \"those Africans.\" We are not pitiful media images, statistics or projections. We are mothers, fathers, children, scholars, artists, doctors, and survivors. We are people.NonprofitI really hope family members of victims of the 9/11 attacks weren\u0027t planning on attending the hearings scheduled at Guantanamo Bay this week. It would be completely demoralizing to someone who suffered personally from the heinous mass murders that took place 13 years ago to find that once again, all efforts to bring the five alleged perpetrators to justice had stalled, and once again, no one\u0027s allowed to know why.Senior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstGeorgia Tech\u0027s Judith Curry has authored an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal claiming that \"there is less urgency to phase out greenhouse gas emissions now\" than in the past. This could not be further from the truth.Director of Penn State Earth System Science Center; Author of \u0027Dire Predictions\u0027 and \u0027The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars\u0027A new law encourages more opportunities for youths in foster care to lead \"normal\" lives by making it easier for their foster parents to allow them to participate in age- or developmentally-appropriate extracurricular and enrichment activities that currently often require permission from the child welfare agency.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundPerformance incentives for public service always -- always -- involve substituting the values of the few for the values of everybody. Imagine if, for instance, we paid fire fighters on sliding scale, based on how many of which type fires they put out at a certain speed.Teacher and writer; blogger, curmudgucation.blogspot.comFor those of you who are determined that we suffer and be held accountable for our mistakes, we can only say that the pain of knowing how deeply we wronged our son and not being able to sit down across from him and ask for his forgiveness is agony beyond all attempt to describe it.Leader, Local HIV/AIDS Outreach Team Leader \u0026 Affirming Hope LifeGroup at Overlake Christian Church in Redmond, WAIf the news media\u0027s job is to educate, and especially to clarify during times of steep public concerns, then the news media have utterly failed during the Ebola threat. And politically, that translates into a win for Republicans because it means there\u0027s fertile ground for their paranoia to grow.Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaFear of resurgent inflation has been a defining element of U.S. economic policy over the last five years, driving federal spending reductions, personal income tax increases, and, just this month, the end of the Federal Reserve\u0027s Quantitative Easing program. But that broad-based inflation has not materialized and we are left asking why?Philanthropy leaderAlthough the CDC can be commended for its efforts to contain Ebola here and abroad, the effort could be improved if changes to the health and risk communication were made.Associate professor of communication studies at The University of Texas at AustinAssociate professor of communication studies at The University of Texas at AustinOctober is Domestic Violence Awareness Month, and it\u0027s important that we realize that the faces of domestic violence victims are all around us -- it may be a friend, a family member, a neighbor, a co-worker, or the clerk at your local grocery store.U.S. Representative of Alabama’s 7th Congressional District.If white Mississippians can identify with, embrace and cheer deliriously for teams that are 82 percent (Mississippi State) and 75 percent (Ole Miss) black, is it too much to hope that they might bring themselves to at least stop hating and show a modicum of respect to a president who is 50 percent black?HistorianThe stories, players and characters behind this World Series are as compelling as in almost any year. If you\u0027re a baseball fan and don\u0027t realize that, you haven\u0027t been paying attention.lincolnmitchell.comOnce you\u0027re in, you\u0027re in, but the idea of having to \"prove\" something about a fundamental part of who you are, just because you don\u0027t have the \"right look,\" seems absurd. Not all Jews are white with curly brown hair, OK? That\u0027s never been the way it was and it never will be.A writer, a woman, a daughter, a friend, in that order.Jill Ginsberg didn\u0027t know any of the people to whom she handed this money. It simply seemed to her that they needed it -- and that she needed to give it away.Writer and activist. Originally a nature writer, since 2009 she has set out to learn about living in service to others. www.jandeblieu.comThis is what it was called before it was referred to as \"global warming,\" and then more accurately and broadly, \"climate change.\" Back in the good old days we figured we still had plenty of time to address it. In that period, nuclear threat was the prime concern.Author, Blogger, Film ProducerMother, Wife, Stage IV Surviving\"I frankly think my wife did the typing, but I don\u0027t remember,\" David Greenglass told me. Without that testimony, the single most incriminating evidence against Ethel Rosenberg, she might well have been acquitted much less executed.Urban affairs correspondent for The New York Times; Author of \u0027A History of New York in 101 Objects\u0027Your gender does not define you. Neither does your job or car or bank account. Be kind and brave, be a good friend and a hard worker and treat everyone with respect -- those are the qualities that will define you.Author, Writer, LawyerIn his recent meeting with Obama, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that he was \"committed to the vision of peace for two states for two peoples.\" That sounds nice. But if he\u0027d been pressed, Netanyahu might have admitted that the two states he had in mind were Israel and the U.S., not Israel and Palestine.Director, Foreign Policy In FocusSurely there is a better way for Christian discourse than to resort to serious accusations of godlessness towards those who may have an alternative opinion, even if that opinion is in the minority.WriterWhile it is important for the Navy to maintain readiness, its proposed war-games in the Gulf of Alaska would be in the wrong place, at the wrong time, and would cause too many impacts to marine mammals.Professor and conservation biologist (www.oasis-earth.com)The days of wine and roses may have been replaced with whines and Legos, but it certainly was an affair to remember.Dreamer, dabbler, do-er. Optimist. Survivor.It is nothing short of a travesty to allow another generation of Palestinians to grow up in a state of limbo, only so their corrupt leaders can ride on their backs and cry wolf about their plight while shamelessly enjoying the good life.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"JUDICIAL CRISIS LOOMING?
