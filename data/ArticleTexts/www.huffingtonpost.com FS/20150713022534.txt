But Jeb Bush’s nomination is far from certain and Bernie Sanders is giving Clinton a run for her money. Indeed, her money is more liability than asset.

Pray for Rand or Jeb, or maybe a vengeful Donald Trump running as an independent. Leave it to Republicans not to nominate someone who can win.The underlying question raised by the Greek financial crisis has been largely ignored, which is whether Greek adoption of the euro -- or even the creation of the Eurozone at all -- was a bad idea to begin with, and one that will not get better with time.

Otherwise it\u0027s \"off to the races\", since a deal without a determined follow-up program may be just a bad as (and maybe worse than) no deal at all.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027As I go through the growing pains of becoming a \"real adult,\" I\u0027m realizing that the notion that I\u0027m responsible for everything that comes into my life is absolute, total crap.
