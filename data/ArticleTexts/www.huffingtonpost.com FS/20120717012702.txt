{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President Obama\u0027s interview with Charlie Rose got interesting when the conversation turned to what the president considers the biggest mistake of his first term. It was, he said, \"thinking that this job was just about getting the policy right.\" So what else is needed? \"The nature of this office is also to tell a story to the American people that gives them a sense of unity and purpose and optimism, especially during tough times.\" But while the president has accurately diagnosed the ailment, he hasn\u0027t delivered on his own prescription. Where is the narrative that will give us that sense of unity and purpose and optimism? His campaign has given us all a crash course on the ills of Bain, but hasn\u0027t given us an alternative narrative of the kind of capitalism that should define the nation as we emerge from the financial crisis -- if, in fact, we ever do.Read Post | Comments (52)Keith Boykin, 07/16/12CNBC contributor, MSNBC commentator and former White House aideAfter all the Republicans have done to coarsen the political rhetoric, they have little or no credibility to complain about negative campaign attacks now.
