All of them -- Nouriel Roubini, Jeffrey Sachs, Joseph Stiglitz, Niall Ferguson, Ann Pettifor, etc. -- are critical of the short-sighted, ad-hoc nature of the stimulus bill. Instead of bailing water out of the sinking ship, they could help construct a replacement appropriate for navigating the economic seas of the 21st century -- and steer it in the right direction.Read Post | CommentsBIOMatthew Bishop, 02.02.2009The economic crisis may be the catalyst that sorts out the best non-profits from the also-rans, leading to a sharp increase in the overall effectiveness of the sector.Read Post | CommentsBIOMarty Kaplan, 02.02.2009Director, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolIt\u0027s no contest.
