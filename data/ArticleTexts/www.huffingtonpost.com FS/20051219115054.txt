{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Imagine that: Viveca Novak provides Bush\u0027s Brain with a possible get-out-of-jail-free card and -- just weeks after she tells Fitzgerald things Rove\u0027s lawyer desperately wants the special prosecutor to hear -- Bush nominates her hubby to the Federal Election Commission. Now I\u0027m not saying that one is payback for the other. But it sure is convenient. It may not be a case of quid pro quo but, if you were to make a list of things that would begin to repair the damage done to the credibility of the media, this sure wouldn\u0027t be among them. This appointment is the nonverbal equivalent of \"Heck of a job, Vivie.\" And it cries out for further investigation.READ POST | comments (22)12.18.2005 Vice Prime Minister Ehud OlmertAs painful as it was, we realized that we could not continue to implement the Prime Minister’s vision for a better future with the current party situation and hence, Kadima was born.READ POST | comments (44)12.18.2005 David SirotaIf the surveillance operations he ordered were so crucial and so important to protecting our country, how come he didn\u0027t get a warrant?READ POST | comments (40)12.18.2005 Marty KaplanIs there anyone more useless than Condi Rice? She was Russert\u0027s first guest, and he gave her ten feet of rope to hang herself with. On the eavesdropping front, she actually said, \"I am not a lawyer\" -- not once, but three times.READ POST | comments (47)12.18.2005 Harry ShearerBecause I seem to know the identity and whereabouts, at least for part of last year, of the supposedly most-wanted terrorist leader in Iraq.READ POST | comments (20)12.18.2005 James PinkertonLong after Fitzgerald has completed his work, prosecutorial pressure on the press will continue, to the point where every reporter with confidential information has one foot in a prison cell.READ POST | comments (17)12.18.2005 Suzanne NosselThe Fighting Dems--the nine and counting Iraq military vets who are running for Congress as Democrats--speak from the heart, and from the pain of real and recent experience on the battlefront.READ POST | comments12.18.2005 Martin GarbusWhen the President wants an opinion that the unique war on terror gives him unique Presidential powers that allow him to do nearly anything, he gets it.READ POST | comments (48)12.18.2005 Cenk UygurA bunch of football players wanted to party, get some strippers, some lap dances and some blowjobs. That sounds like the America I know and love.READ POST | comments (39)12.18.2005 Katrina vanden HeuvelJournalists and media organizations must find a way to restore their role as effective watchdogs -- as checks on an executive run amok.READ POST | comments12.18.2005 Eric SchmeltzerIt wasn’t enough for Klein to have Dean on the record saying something politically unwise, Klein had to show that Dean was downright giddy about it. So he obfuscated the quote.READ POST | comments12.18.2005 Richard ValerianiBush admits allowing NSA to spy domestically, calls revelation of classified information illegal.

In a globalized economy that means they cannot work.READ POST | comments (15)12.18.2005 Stephen ElliottI thought about the gunner, painting the toy factory on the North Pole, guiding home the missiles that never missed, the bloodied elves emerging from the wreckage.READ POST | comments12.18.2005 Bob CescaAuthorities seeking the President of the United States who has admitted to violating FISA law and the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution: He shouldn\u0027t be difficult to track down.READ POST | comments (27)12.18.2005 Hooman MajdIf a country is sovereign, normally that country\u0027s leaders would be aware of a senior foreign official\u0027s plans to drop in for a tour or a chat.
