{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Lincoln Mitchelllincolnmitchell.comBy the end of 2013, it appeared that the major domestic political story of the year had been the botched rollout and negative reaction, in some quarters, to the Affordable Care Act (ACA). It is likely, however, that a year from now the ACA will be more accepted as a real, but limited, improvement to health care policy in the US and that another issue will have emerged as the most important issue of 2013. 2013 was the year where issues of income inequality, raised by the Occupy Movement in 2011, stressed by Pope Francis and, belatedly, by President Obama finally came to the fore of American politics. It is likely they will remain there for some time to come.Comments (17)Mark GongloffChief financial writer, The Huffington PostBreaking news: The Wall Street Journal editorial page is full of it. OK, that\u0027s not really news. But an unusually flagrant example of the WSJ editorial page\u0027s hogwash artistry caught the world\u0027s eye on Thursday.Comments (1,177)Tessa GouldDirector, HuffPost Partner StudioThe banter around native advertising, and more specifically native content publishing, reached fever pitch this year. Every man and his dog had a view on how it should be defined, measured, labeled, scaled and priced. And while the the jury may still be out on a number of these issues, one thing we do know here at HuffPost Partner Studio is bloody good native content when we see it.CommentsEric RobergeCertified Financial Planner, Founder of Beyond Your HammockIf there\u0027s one thing I\u0027d like you to take away from this story, it\u0027s this: Don\u0027t put off until someday all the things you know you should do today. Life is short enough, and circumstances can easily derail us from our true intentions at any moment.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorMichael Moore\u0027s oped in today\u0027s NYT about both the shortcomings and attributes of the Affordable Care Act, on the day its coverage officially begins to kick in, gets the politics wrong but he gets the policy right in important ways.Comments (172)Miho KubagawaBirmingham, AL native working in the education sector in NYCFor the first time in my life, I actually stuck to my New Year\u0027s resolution for 2013. My friends did too and we\u0027re already discussing what we\u0027re going to focus on for 2014. What sparked the change?CommentsGeoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoMore than anything else at the moment, the Intelligence Community needs to win back the trust of the American people. It can do that, not by being defensive, but by acknowledging that periodic review, reexamination and recalibration are healthy and constructive in a self-governing society.Comments (21)Jordan K. TurgeonLifestyle Blog Editor, The Huffington PostMy compulsive checking had become a burden instead of a fun way to keep in touch. I wanted to live a better, more present life, and in order to do that I had to stop bombarding myself with information on how everyone else was living theirs.Comments (15)Peter DreierE.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeProgressives are rarely satisfied. It is part of our political DNA. There\u0027s so much injustice in the world, it\u0027s sometimes hard to feel that we\u0027re making progress. Let\u0027s look back at 2013 and examine 25 significant accomplishments.CommentsRichard KirschSenior Fellow, Roosevelt Institute; author of \u0027Fighting for Our Health\u0027Is the political system in the United States capable of responding to the escalating crisis of stagnant wages, shrinking benefits, dissolving economic opportunity, and disappearing hopes of living anything that resembles the American Dream? It is a question I ask myself every day.CommentsChristine PelosiChair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusAs 2014 dawns, women on the run in political office and public service have multitasking ahead. How well we juggle doing it all -- home life, work life, personal space and public engagement -- may well determine the fate of our families and our nation.CommentsScott Barry Kaufman, Ph.D.Co-founder, The Creativity Post; Author, \u0027Ungifted: Intelligence Redefined\u0027Today billions of Americans will pull out their lists of New Year\u0027s resolutions, full of intentions to control their many temptations, from one-night stands to junk food to alcohol to smoking. What are the costs of all that self-control?Comments (13)Paul SzepTwo-time Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonistCommentsLeigh WeingusAssistant Editor, HuffPost TVWhat did I want for myself in 2013? My mind drifted to yoga. I had signed up for a teacher training program, so why not make this my Year Of Yoga by supplementing my training with additional classes? 200 seemed like a nice round number, and it\u0027s not like it would take over my life.CommentsSteven FulopMayor, Jersey CityIn trying to achieve their reckless goal of demolishing government, Republicans have hurt far too many Americans. Alternatively, under the correct circumstances, government should be able to help grow the economy.Comments (29)Adam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; co-founder of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911So 2014 is the year of the great financial leap forward, eh? But like many a New Year\u0027s resolution about diets, exercise or de-cluttering, the seeming enormity of the task always becomes one of the big reasons that we end up breaking our promise by February.CommentsTeresa GhilarducciEconomics professor, The New School for Social ResearchTake a guess; how many Americans earn $50 million or more per year? Answer: 199 earn a wage or salary of over $50 million a year which turns out to be about $117,000 daily. Why are these fellow Americans interesting?Comments (35)Carl PopeFormer executive director and chairman, Sierra ClubClimate disruption, broadband access and crumbling bridges and roads have an odd thing in common: they have entered the never-never land of conservative denialism -- where they are simply not problems for which the right feels obliged to offer solutions.CommentsRev. Dr. Susan Brooks ThistlethwaiteProfessor of Theology, Chicago Theological SeminaryIs this just a further sign of the \"moral decay\" of American society, or can we say the legalization of marijuana can have a place in a Christian theology that values, instead of denigrates, the body?Comments (31)William HartungDirector, Arms and Security Project, Center for International PolicyEven before the word sequester came to dominate the budget debate in Washington, there were signs that the military-industrial complex was no longer ten feet tall.CommentsDarron T. Smith, Ph.D.ProfessorWhite parents that espouse \"love is enough\" are, in fact, doing Black adoptees a huge disservice, potentially exposing their children to a high degree of racial identity confusion and a poor ability to effectively cope with race-based mistreatment.CommentsDavid J. EicherEditor-in-Chief, Astronomy magazineOver the next few days Earth will be passing through a stream of cosmic debris left in the wake of a near-Earth asteroid, 2003 EH1. Intersecting this trail of rocky particles means that some of these little guys will be pulled down into our atmosphere by Earth\u0027s gravity, causing a nice meteor shower.CommentsJuliette FayAuthor of The Shortest Way HomeJanuary 1 hails not only a new year, but also a new era for the 104-year-old Boy Scouts of America (BSA). It\u0027s the day a new policy allowing openly gay boys to join took effect.CommentsDavid L. PhillipsDirector, Program on Peace-building and Rights, Columbia University Institute for the Study of Human RightsFriends must be honest. It\u0027s time for some tough-love from the West. The Obama administration must be steely-eyed, seeing Turkey as it is -- not as it was -- or how Washington wants it to be.CommentsLorraine Devon WilkeWriter of Sass \u0026 SensibilityAs a longtime fan of the creative team involved, I\u0027d been looking forward to the film; when the online debate began over the ethical rationale of telling the story of someone like Jordan Belfort, I was all the more intrigued.CommentsMJ RosenbergBlogger, Tikkun, Washington SpectatorIn the United States today, students can freely discuss anything... except Israel. How crazy is that? The same people who set limits on debate in college are also in the book censoring business.CommentsRachael ClarkeMother, wife, writer, copy editorI wonder sometimes how you will see yourself as you age, as routines become more commonplace and ordinary, as the world starts to lose its magic. In the moments when you can\u0027t see yourself, when you feel lost in a world that so often focuses on the surface of things.CommentsMario LivioAstrophysicist, Space Telescope Science InstituteYou may wonder what another civilization might regard as relatively reliable biosignatures of Earth, were this civilization to observe Earth from a distance of tens of light-years.CommentsJennifer BenderyWhen I really think about 2013, I realize I spent most of the year looking for her. We once had a pact: If one of us died, you\u0027d have to send the other one a sign that you were okay, that you weren\u0027t reeeeeally gone but just in a different place.Comments (73)V-DayA global activist movement to end violence against women and girlsI saw, like a picture, every step of our 13-year journey in their fierceness, in their courage, in their generosity and love of our women and our country -- as well as in their joy and insistence on hope.CommentsPaul AbramsLast person on Earth not on FacebookAs the D.C. media feigns apoplexy over enrollment rates in the Affordable Care Act, the rest of the country will awaken to a world in which people with pre-existing illnesses will be covered and people will not live in constant fear of being an illness away from bankruptcy.Comments (35)Joseph ParkerAuthor and Digital Marketing ProfessionalThe temptation you may have to rob others may come to you suddenly this year given the state of things, but I urge you to avoid it. Working provides you with a cerebral sense of satisfaction that goes beyond the simple collection of a paycheck. Also, robbery is a felony.CommentsDavid J.
