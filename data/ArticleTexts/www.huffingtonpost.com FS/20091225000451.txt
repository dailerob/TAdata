{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"See all posts »BIOTime for my annual tradition of getting gifts for my favorite -- and not so favorite -- public figures. This year, I\u0027m getting Joe Lieberman a DVD of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington so he can see the proper use of a filibuster -- to fight corruption, not promote it. Mark Sanford and Tiger Woods could obviously use some software that makes love-sick emails self-destruct 60 seconds after you send them, while Jenny Sanford and Elin Nordegren need husbands they can trust -- and an at-home HIV test.

Check out the rest of my list, then post your gift ideas for public figures in the comments section. We\u0027ll collect the best ones and unwrap them on Christmas Day.Read Post | Comments (206)BIOTrey Ellis, 12.23.2009Novelist, Screenwriter, and Assistant Professor at Columbia UniversityI wish all of you the best Christmas ever.
