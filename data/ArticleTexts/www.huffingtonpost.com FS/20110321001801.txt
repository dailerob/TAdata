{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week\u0027s headlines were rightly dominated by news from Japan, Libya, and Bahrain. But developments on another international story -- Afghanistan -- also deserve our attention. Joining a growing list of Republican leaders, Haley Barbour took his first steps toward a possible 2012 run by sharply questioning our continuing presence in the country.

Of course, Barbour and Huckabee are actually catching up to the American people: a new poll showed that 64 percent of the public says the war in Afghanistan is no longer worth fighting. You know we\u0027ve moved way beyond left vs. right on this issue when Afghanistan threatens to become an issue in 2012, with the GOP hopefuls staking out the anti-war position. Elsewhere, Gilbert Gottfried and Barbour spokesman Dan Turner were enshrined in the #waytoosoon hall of shame.Read Post | CommentsJimmy Kimmel, 03.14.2011Host, Jimmy Kimmel LiveSince I was a kid, four dreams have played on a loop in my head, all of them bad.
