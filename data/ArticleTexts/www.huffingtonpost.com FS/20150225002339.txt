{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027We could have trade deals that would advance the interests of workers in the United States. For example, if we focused on reducing patent and copyright protections nationally and internationally, we could save hundreds of billions annually on drugs and other products. We could also loosen professional barriers that cause our doctors to earn twice as much as their counterparts in other wealthy countries, leading to huge savings in health care costs. But these items are not on President Obama\u0027s trade agenda. Rather, it is dominated by a list of measures that are likely to increase inequality. And if his trade deals are defeated because they refuse to take any steps to redress the trade deficit and the loss of well-paying manufacturing jobs to trade, it will not be bad news for the country.There is a government role in combating sex trafficking and the abusers -- but what about the victims? These women are broken physically, emotionally, and spiritually. They need healing in all areas and Christian-based programs have proven to be successful over and over. I will continue to be a voice for these victims.U.S. Senator from KentuckyThe anniversary of the Maidan massacre (February 18-21 2014) invites \u0027on the other side of the hill\u0027 thinking to form a picture of how Ukraine looks from President Putin\u0027s pedestal. The West seems oblivious that Russia has suffered a strategic defeat disguised by tactical victories. But have a look.Author, \u0027The Global Economy in Transition\u0027Bruce Rauner may think that he is auditioning for a spot on the 2016 GOP ticket or a cabinet post in a Bush, Walker or Christie administration. In fact he could easily become the national symbol of the trickle down economic theory that has failed to produce benefits for everyday Americans.Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersNobody expects Bill O\u0027Reilly to tell the truth; it wasn\u0027t part of his job description but it was part of Bob McDonald\u0027s.AuthorEducation has always been central to the American Dream: the promise that if you work hard, you can achieve anything. Unfortunately, the skyrocketing cost of student loan debt means that when millions of Americans should be building their careers, starting their families, and pursuing their dreams, they are instead being held back.U.S. Senate Candidate, Cincinnati City CouncilmanRon Wallace\u0027s connectional intelligence inspired him to ask unprecedented questions. Inclusive connectivity gave him the ability to ask those questions to literally anyone in the world, creating a list of resources that would have been unimaginable a generation ago.Co-Author, Get Big Things Done, EricaDhawan.comWashington is now well into the second decade of an endless War on Terror that seems the sum of its exceptions to international law: endless incarceration, extrajudicial killing, pervasive surveillance, drone strikes in defiance of national boundaries and torture on demand.Professor of History at the University of Wisconsin-MadisonThis letter is STRICTLY an attempt to procure work for myself and if that means bumping Neil Patrick Harris out of the way next year, then so be it. And so without further ado --Stand-Up Comic, WriterAmerica has vilified Brian Williams for lying and NBC suspended him for six months. Bill O\u0027Reilly was not in a war zone and wasn\u0027t in a combat situation. Can anyone explain how O\u0027Reilly is better, or more deserving of leniency than Brian Williams?Columnist, journalist, and author published in The Hill\u0027s Congress Blog, The Jerusalem Post, Salon.com, and other publicationsMost of us are still operating under a 20th-century paradigm. We were taught that learning all we can about a specific profession is the key to moving up to our goal rung on the socioeconomic ladder. Even \"digital natives\" learned this flawed premise; like the generations before them, they still think that hard skills are the key to advancement.Author, Speaker, EntrepreneurI just learned from Alexandra Hildebrandt Hoy, Fred Hildebrandt\u0027s daughter, that her father did not write a diary account of this Canadian camping trip with Norman Rockwell in 1934. By this account, the diary that Deborah Solomon refers to in her biography of my grandfather does not exist; it never did.Jazz singer/songwriter; granddaughter of Norman RockwellIs this what we want, to make people nervous about engaging in dialogue? I hate to think about all the teachable moments that never happened because someone was afraid to ask me -- or any of us -- a question.Producer, HuffPost LiveLike one of the characters from \"Downton Abbey,\" Aaron Schock has made quite a climb, from public servant downstairs to pampered upstairs aristocrat.Senior writer, Moyers \u0026 Company on public TV. Senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.Stuttering is just as much an internal dilemma as it is an external one. Friends and family members and teachers don\u0027t know the embarrassment that happens when you know what you want to say but can\u0027t say it and someone else has to say it for you. They can\u0027t see your confidence deteriorating.Associate Editor, Blogs \u0026 CommunityI don\u0027t think you need a crystal ball to predict that whoever runs for president in 2016 will have some sort of tax cut at the heart of their platform, probably targeted at the middle class, and I\u0027m talking both Democrats and Republicans.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorIt was a place where it was OK that I felt guilty after eating or wanted to cry because I hated my body. But it was also a place where I could feel proud of myself.Online community for teens promoting positive body imageIt has been a year, almost to the day, since the revolution in Ukraine overthrew the corrupt, tyrannical, and, in its last days, murderous regime of Viktor Yanukovych. To mark the anniversary of that event, President Petro Poroshenko invited me to the Kiev National Opera to perform my play, Hôtel Europe.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.Leveling the legal playing field for women holds real promise for the world -- in both human and economic terms. Unfortunately, that promise remains largely ignored and its potential untapped.Managing Director, IMFWe want everyone to enjoy the same benefits so many of us take for granted, to come out of the financial shadows, to put their money to work for them and not for the check cashers and payday lenders.President \u0026 CEO of Amalgamated BankCo-Executive Director, Make the Road New YorkNobody tells the carefree 25-year-old female that in another 25 years she\u0027ll be invisible. In Western cultures women of a certain age are not revered. They are subjected to the swipe of a metaphorical hand that casts them aside and signifies to them that they have all but expired.Freelance writer and bloggerI have a feeling that Jon Stewart, with his ersatz Ph.D. from Comedy Central (and no student debt), might like to get on the field of real news and journalism, at least the televised kind, and do something to solve those problems, both the country\u0027s and the conflictinator\u0027s.Author and JournalistNews organizations, social media and internet services have editorial discretion -- protected by the first amendment--to deny ISIS access to their audiences. To the extent they do so, more power to them. They are acting responsibly, in my opinion.Executive Director, First Amendment CoalitionRivera recently found himself in hot water after making some controversial remarks about the impact that Hip-Hop has had on minority communities.?? In this clip he explains his position but concedes that in describing Hip-Hop in general as being harmful to young minorities, he may have painted with too broad a brush.PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorWe feel confident that we can tell everything we need to know about you from that choice.Everything worth caring about in food, drink, and travelCheck out these different ways to eat the most-Instagrammed food of our time.SpoonUniversity.comIt now amusing for Democrats to watch the \"Ted Cruz wing\" of the GOP try to defend their big DHS bill, just as it will be amusing to watch them howl later this week when it gets split in two. All a Democrat will have to do to really rub it in will be to say, \"But you\u0027ve been saying all along that immigration reform can only be done one tiny step at a time!\"Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comComputers run the world--our airports, airplanes, cars, hospitals, stock markets and power grids--and these computers too are shockingly vulnerable to attack.
