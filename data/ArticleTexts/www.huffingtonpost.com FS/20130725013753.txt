{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonWin the Moment. That\u0027s the theme of the two-day conference that Twitter is holding for its employees in San Francisco, where I just spoke. In many ways, it\u0027s a surprisingly modest topic, since whether Twitter has won the moment is not very much in doubt. Like anything that\u0027s so closely intertwined with humanity, Twitter can be funny, angry, happy, messy, selfish, and selfless. It can help topple governments, as it did during the Arab Spring. It can serve as a communication lifeline, as it did during the earthquake and tsunami in Fukushima. And it can make watching the red carpet a lot more fun. Humans are built for communication, and anything that helps fill that insatiable need is going to take off. We\u0027re also built for narrative, and, even at 140 characters, Twitter can tap into that, too. Adam Bain, Twitter\u0027s president of global revenue, once said that \"Twitter is a series of \u0027now moments\u0027 across the world.\" But add up an accumulating series of now moments, and what you have is, well, history.CommentsWadah KhanfarJournalist; President, Sharq ForumThree weeks after the toppling of Morsi, with its attendant arbitrary detentions, intimidation, and smear campaigns against his supporters, it is now apparent that the political crisis in the country is further away from a solution.Comments (51)Social SmurfSocial Media Blogger, SmurfSo your kids want to get on Facebook and Twitter? Here\u0027s how to set up their accounts and their privacy settings.CommentsPaul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostWeiner and Abedin are perhaps the highest profile interfaith couple in America and the troubles in their relationship have the potential to be used as another case in point of those issuing dire warnings about interfaith marriages.CommentsMarcia CrossAward-winning actressWhere I sit now is simply in awe, in awe of women \"leaning in\" and \"leaning out\" and the brilliance of their day-to-day achievements. Both journeys are all encompassing and require talent, endurance and devotion.Comments (26)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThe analysis flowed insightfully from diagnosis to prescription, with a correct and strong emphasis on how the economy and policy has changed over recent decades in ways that exacerbate the disconnect between middle-class prosperity and the economy\u0027s growth.Comments (62)Robert CreamerPolitical Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersToday the President delivers a major economic address at Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois against a background of a growing consensus among economists throughout the world that the GOP\u0027s brand of \"trickledown\" economics is a complete failure wherever it is tried.Comments (991)Mark GongloffChief financial writer, The Huffington PostIt\u0027s official: Pretty much everybody thinks Larry Summers would make a terrible Federal Reserve Chairman. Everybody, that is, except for the one guy whose vote matters: President Obama.Comments (595)Tom Zeller Jr.MIT Knight Science Journalism FellowThe Iberian lynx might soon fall victim to a trend in extinction that is outpacing millions of years of evolution for the planet\u0027s plants and animals, scientists suggest. Human-driven global warming is a key culprit, and unless things change, the future is likely to become a far less biologically diverse.Comments (109)Shirin SadeghiIndependent TV \u0026 Radio Host, ex-BBC \u0026 Al JazeeraEven before Tuesday\u0027s revelations, Weiner\u0027s \u0027Weiner So Sorry\u0027 tour was already devoid of any substance once you removed his contrived family-man image from the picture.Comments (115)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027As we head toward renewed battles over the debt ceiling, sequester, and government funding, it\u0027s important to understand why Republicans are disciplined and Democrats aren\u0027t. The difference has to do with the kind of personalities the two parties attract.Comments (222)Trent HauserAgent, NTSF:SD:SUV::It\u0027s summer, which means that fall is right around the corner and of course that means it\u0027s \"Back to Terrorism\" season. So today I\u0027m going to give you some high-priority intel on the latest terrorists that have been invading our country at an alarming rate.CommentsEthan RomeExecutive Director, Health Care for America NowHouse Speaker John Boehner is leading what is arguably the most anti-jobs Congress in modern history, and he and his co-conspirators in the Senate have been systematically sabotaging the economy and the opportunity for millions of Americans to go back to work.Comments (70)Emma GrayEditor, HuffPost WomenI have come to know my anxiety like a close \"frenemy,\" and the more I talk about her, the more I find that other women relate. When we\u0027ve reached a point where 23 percent of American women are all struggling with the same demons, it time to start talking about them and confronting them -- collectively.Comments (91)Andrew DixonCertified personal trainerI take issue with transformations that are manipulated with Photoshop, professional lighting, postures to degrade or enhance their look, pro tans, sucking in or pushing out a belly, or flexing muscles. I decided to take my own transformation photos to see what was possible with a few tweaks.Comments (712)Joe PeyronninHofstra Journalism ProfessorWeiner has every right to run for mayor of New York City. But, given these latest embarrassing revelations, why does he want to expose (pardon the pun) himself and his family to such painful humiliation?Comments (75)Bill Moyers and Michael WinshipAnd you thought the government didn\u0027t have a jobs program. It does. The problem is that the pay and benefits are lousy, and in many cases the working conditions ain\u0027t so great either.Comments (375)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027It is bizarre that Summers would be seriously considered as the next Fed chair. Memories tend to be short in Washington, but those of us removed from elite circles know that Summers\u0027 policies played a central role in setting up the economy for the crash.Comments (265)Josh Klenert and Otto TothWe\u0027re thrilled to announce the newest update to The Huffington Post app for Android -- now optimized for larger tablet screens. When we relaunched our Android app for phones back in February, we promised that this was just the beginning.Comments (12)Sharda SekaranManaging Director of Communications, Drug Policy AllianceFrom clothing to intoxicants, what is normal and innocuous in another context becomes sinister when associated with black men and boys.Comments (101)Craig NewmarkFounder, craigslist and craigconnects.orgCustomer service can really be corrosive, and it gets worse than the usual trolling and abuse. However, singer and poet Leonard Cohen really helps me get through the day, with a small but substantial assist from Dr Stephen T. Colbert, DFA.CommentsEmily HelckWriter and artistI paid as much mind to my hair and face as I had to the wounds I had been dressing, performing rituals of grooming I had nearly forgotten. My heart swelled, and after a year of cellular and spiritual purging, I suddenly felt full.CommentsJon SoltzCo-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranJust like in Iraq, it is clear that Senator John McCain is living in an fantasy-land, where the American military alone can shape any geopolitical situation into whatever it wants, like a lump of clay.Comments (14)Ron ThomasDirector, Morehouse College Journalism and Sports ProgramWhat\u0027s most unsettling about Martin\u0027s fate is that no black parent -- no matter how watchful or even paranoid -- would have thought to issue a warning against \"walking with Skittles.\"Comments (44)Sean McElweeWriterStricter regulation of Internet speech will not be popular with the libertarian-minded citizens of the United States, but it\u0027s necessary.Comments (87)Donald KraybillTLC has found another crew of renegade Amish and Mennonite youth to cast for Breaking Amish . If the LA version is anything like the previous Breaking Amish or Amish Mafia, not only will the \"reality\" show include heavy doses of fiction, it will also fabricate more myths about Amish life that deserve a good debunking.Comments (79)Wray HerbertAuthor, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027Countries vary dramatically in their records of environmental responsibility. Clearly there are economic and political reasons for these stark differences, but is it also possible that human psychology plays a role in creating collective pro-environmental mindsets?CommentsMarlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistI\u0027m not much for watching golf on TV, but something happened this weekend that endeared me to the sport. Just moments after links veteran Phil Mickelson sank his final putt to win his first ever British Open title, his caddie of more than two decades, Jim Mackay, fell into the new champion\u0027s arms and burst into tears.Comments (18)Adam GrantWharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027When male CEOs father their first child, they pay their employees less when it\u0027s a son, but more if it\u0027s a daughter.Comments (12)Jeff DanzigerPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideCommentsPamela MeyerFounder and CEO, CalibrateThough Braun was able to bluff his way past MLB officials for the better part of two years, they clearly suspected something was up. Sometimes those suspicions are intuitive; sometimes they come from a trained eye.CommentsAlissa EscarcePolicy Associate, Rights Working GroupThough James Comey has made public comments that suggest a tacit endorsement of racial profiling, neither the media nor the Senate has asked him to address these issues. Those who believe in civil liberties and racial justice should find this troubling.CommentsStanley Hainsworth, 2013.24.07Paul Brandeis Raushenbush, 2013.24.07Richard (RJ) Eskow, 2013.24.07Nikolas Kozloff, 2013.24.07Rabbi Levi Welton, 2013.24.07Arianna Huffington, 2013.24.07Luis A.
