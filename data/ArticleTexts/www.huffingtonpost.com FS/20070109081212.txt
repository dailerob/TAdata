{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"APAPAPAPWhen it comes to the White House\u0027s latest \"new approach\" to Iraq, we are definitely entering \"the lunatics have taken over the asylum\" territory. Psychiatric literature defines delusional thinking as \"false or irrational beliefs maintained despite clear evidence to the contrary.\" Sound like any commander-in-chief you know? So as the president prepares to preempt Deal or No Deal to lay out his new plan for Iraq Wednesday night (and wouldn\u0027t it be great if we could all collectively shout \"No deal! No deal!!\" at him through our TVs?), it might be useful to have a diagnostic checklist -- key symptoms we should be looking for during the speech to help us evaluate where the president currently rates on the delusional scale.READ POST | comments (55)01.08.2007 Brady Van EngelenThe uniformed men and women of this nation comprise of less than .5 % of the American population - the other 99.5 % of the nation are merely being asked to believe in our sacrifice.READ POST | comments (12)01.08.2007 Alicia C.

The last book on it is particularly disturbing.
