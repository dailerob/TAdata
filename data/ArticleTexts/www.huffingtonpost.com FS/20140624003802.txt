{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This month has brought ample evidence of the power of sleep to affect us in both positive and negative ways, and demonstrated why we need to start treating sleep as the vital health, safety and social issue that it is. I\u0027ve been evangelizing about the upside of downtime for many years, but it seems like every week brings yet more evidence. The science is in on the powerful benefits sleep can give us, as are the grim statistics on the deadly consequences of believing we can get by without it. It\u0027s time to put to bed the idea that sleep is a \"nice to have,\" or even \"nonessential\" for some people, recognize that it\u0027s an \"absolute need to have\" and wake up to the central role it plays in all our lives.As President, my top priority is rebuilding an economy where everybody who works hard has the chance to get ahead. That\u0027s the subject of the first White House Summit on Working Families, which is taking place today.44th President of the United StatesOne of the tricks that corporations use to batter down wages is to contract out work, so that the true employer is not accountable to its workforce. What is shocking is that the most influential employer that resorts to this device is none other than the federal government.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The head-scratching question continues to be, why? Why are the discredited \"experts\" who botched Iraq last time now being a given a platform to comment on the military crisis they helped create?Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaMany today are calling for us to create a much more vocational style of teaching. They claim that in today\u0027s economy we should track students earlier into specific fields for which they seem to have aptitude. This is exactly the opposite of the American tradition of liberal education.President, Wesleyan UniversityToday only 20 percent of U.S. families have a working father and a stay-at-home mother. Instead, two thirds of families depend either partly or wholly on the wages of working women, and many of those families are barely making it. Fully 42 million women in this country and the 28 million kids who depend on them are teetering on or over the brink of poverty.Award-winning journalist, bestselling author and activistFounder and CEO, Tipping Point CommunityAs we welcome a settlement for the Central Park Five, we must address the issues that landed them in jail without sufficient evidence: police and prosecutorial misconduct, coerced confessions and media messaging that often depicts minorities as thugs or troublemakers.President, National Action NetworkOver the years, I have witnessed the steady decline of the dolphins that used to chase our boat, the fish that I could land, and the plentiful shellfish I took for granted. The oceans of my childhood have been overfished, polluted, and strewn with plastic waste.Academy Award nominated actressTo encourage efficiency, we would want a proper set of regulations and taxes and have them apply equally to everyone. The point is to encourage people to make profits by providing better products or lower cost services, not to get rich by finding clever ways to evade regulations.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Since the publication of Jo Becker\u0027s controversial Forcing the Spring, it\u0027s fair to say that the Prop 8 legal team have been on the defensive. A lot of us have wondered what they thought about the book, so last week I interviewed Ted Olson, a lifelong Republican and former solicitor general under George W. Bush, and put these and other questions to him.Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesHere are some things you need to remember when talking on the phone. For those of you uncomfortable with written language we offer a helpful emoji translation.Some of the titles I suggest will surprise you. Only three of the books I recommended to her (and now to you) are \"how to get over a breakup\" books.

There are three overwhelming and compelling reasons why this is so.Coordinator of Development Communications and Research, Drug Policy AllianceOf course, despite the general predominance of male characters in literature, there are many books that do pass the Bechdel Test. So we decided to compile a list of just a few stunning pieces of fiction that show women in relation to each other -- not just men.Books Editor, The Huffington PostThis is dangerous nonsense. Nonsense because the performance of the England team has actually improved in the 20 years since the end of restrictions on player mobility, and dangerous because xenophobia is on the rise in Europe as a whole.Co-author of Soccernomics, Professor of Sport Management at University of MichiganAnalysts have speculated that the seven-time NBA All-Star would either re-sign with the Knicks or become a member of the Chicago Bulls or Houston Rockets. However, as you\u0027re about to find out, the Dallas Mavericks are the best fit for \u0027Melo.Director of Content at Tradesports.com, Editor of TradesportsInsider.comSting may not plan on leaving very much of his wealth to his offspring, but don\u0027t mistake him for some kind of equalizing role model out of Thomas Piketty\u0027s dreams.Chief financial writer, The Huffington PostIt turns out that many physicians don\u0027t trust themselves to make competency decisions about whether people should own or carry guns.Mike the Gun GuyAmerica in 2014 typically condemns racist behavior in the sports world -- just look at what happened to Donald Sterling. However, we\u0027ve stood idly by for decades when the object of the racism is Native Americans.Assistant Professor at Howard University School of LawWhere is the Iraqi Air Force? What does the Iraqi Air Force consist of? How many attack helicopters and attack fighters does it have in flyable condition? Most importantly, how many trained pilots does it have who can fly combat missions?Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comIf you\u0027re an introvert and the parent of a small human, it can be very freeing to realize that maybe it\u0027s not just that you \"don\u0027t like the baby stage.\" Maybe it\u0027s just that being with people 24 hours a day -- even the wonderful little beings you created -- is difficult and draining.Professional freelance writer and creator of The Fussy Baby SiteThe story of a private equity firm, a missing pool fence, and the death of a two-year-old child raises troubling questions about how, as a nation, we define security in housing and why, in the midst of what\u0027s regularly termed a \"recovery,\" many neighborhoods may actually be growing increasingly vulnerable.Author, \u0027A Dream Foreclosed\u0027It\u0027s not easy going totally green, but it\u0027s hard to admit that it didn\u0027t feel good.Blog editor, The Huffington PostThe current research delivers sobering news but also opens some important pathways for future inquiry, ones that may lead to new and better treatments for sleep problems and perhaps for other neurodegenerative diseases.Clinical Psychologist; Board Certified Sleep SpecialistThe current controversy over \u0027puto\u0027 boils down to two simple questions: (1) is it a homophobic slur?, and if so, (2) should its use be banned by FIFA?Associate Professor of Spanish Linguistics, University of New HampshireWhether you\u0027re getting glam for cocktail hour at a rooftop lounge in Manhattan, partying poolside in LA or basking in the natural beauty of the Outer Banks, I recommend shaking up your makeup routine with that same sense of adventure.Makeup artistNot so fast. Cantor didn\u0027t lose because he supported immigration reform. Cantor lost because of his inaction on immigration reform, plus several strategic errors. His defeat can teach the Republican Party a good lesson -- if it\u0027s willing to face facts.Attorney; USA Today Columnist, NBC News ContributorThe religious right has been freaking out about Neil deGrasse Tyson\u0027s Cosmos for what feels like an eternity. And, while the theological complaints seem laughable for their rancor and predictability, it\u0027s time we thought harder about what they represent.WriterRace-based comedy has long been a useful site for understanding the fault lines, ambiguities, and absurdities of race in the United States. For better and/or worse, the Internet has democratized the production and dissemination of race-based comedy.Assistant Professor of Ethnicity, Race \u0026 Migration and American Studies at Yale UniversityIt is truly astonishing how many otherwise progressive people consider their prejudice against pit bulls to be perfectly reasonable, when the data shows it isn\u0027t.Editor, HuffPost DCHow can we build a 21st century workplace that supports thriving employees, growing businesses, and healthy economies all at once?
