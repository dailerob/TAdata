And whether or not it does is going to depend on our ability -- personally, collectively, globally -- to respond to crises. As the Rockefeller Foundation\u0027s Judith Rodin writes, \"Building resilience is not a luxury, it\u0027s a 21st century imperative.\" I\u0027m looking forward to a week of discussions about how to meet that challenge.Read Post | Comments (51)Ian Bremmer, 01/22/13Author, \u0027Every Nation for Itself\u0027The World Economic Forum has set the catchphrase for this year\u0027s summit: \u0027Resilient Dynamism.\u0027 If that\u0027s difficult to digest, it\u0027s because the risk outlook is equally cloudy and disparate.Read Post | CommentsRichard Blanco, 01/20/13Inauguration PoetI don\u0027t know what a faggot means, really; don\u0027t even know about sex yet.

Hilda Solis, 01/22/13U.S. Secretary of LaborToday, as I prepared to say farewell, I decided that I wanted to share my experience through journeys, and through beginnings and endings, because that reflects what\u0027s in my mind, and more importantly, what is in my heart at this present moment.Read Post | CommentsTom Zeller Jr., 01/22/13Senior Writer, The Huffington PostIf rhetorical flourishes are an indication of future action -- and that is a substantial \"if\" -- then President Barack Obama\u0027s comments on climate change suggest that the next four years may provide much of what climate activists have been hankering for.Read Post | Comments (66)Brooke Carey, 01/21/13Book Editor, writerA few years ago, my gynecologist left me a voicemail telling me to call her back.
