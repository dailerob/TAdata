{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureThe Republican convention, with its high-tech stage and Hollywood directors, will try to remake Mitt Romney once more, reintroducing him as a family man of faith, charitable, good-hearted, experienced in business and government, ready to put America back on track. Romney is of, by and for the very Gilded Age capitalism that generated extreme inequality, rising poverty and a declining middle class even before it blew up the economy. He will change his views on social issues to fit the prevailing winds, and remake his image with each rising sun. But on economic issues he is the man from Bain. Want more of what we\u0027ve had? He is your man.Read Post | Comments (318)Lisa Belkin, 08/21/12Senior columnist for life/work/family, The Huffington PostPut aside for the moment the horrifying reality that Akin feels that some rapes are more \"legitimate\" than others.
