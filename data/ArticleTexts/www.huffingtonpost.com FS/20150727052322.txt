{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week brought multiple challenges to move from outrage to action. On Tuesday, the dash cam video of the violent arrest of Sandra Bland was released; authorities later said autopsy results suggested she had committed suicide while in jail. But many questions remain, including why, already this year, an estimated 651 people have been killed by police -- 172 of them African American, 142 unarmed. Less questionable is that our justice system is broken, and in ways that inescapably involve race. On Thursday there was yet another mass shooting, this time in Lafayette, Louisiana. The gunman, despite having a long criminal record, had legally obtained his weapon. Just hours before the shooting, President Obama had said the \"great frustration\" of his presidency was not being able to pass \"common-sense gun safety laws.\" As we move into the election season, it\u0027s time to put both of these critical issues on the front burner. Neither will change until we demand it.The Iran deal has become legally enshrined -- but that does not guarantee that Iran will fully abide by its provisions, let alone cease its subversive activity. To that end, to enforce the deal, the U.S. must focus not only on preventing Iran from getting nuclear weapons, but how to force it to change its behavior.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUAs a dyslexic kid, my biggest fear in life was to go in front of the class and read because I just wasn\u0027t very good at it -- and that stays with you through your whole life. I practiced, and practiced, and practiced, and practiced to make sure I\u0027d nail it.Public speaker, activist, OlympianViewed through the lens of history, the main job of U.S. presidents is to be mature and wise enough to stand up to the permanent war machine.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia UniversityJustice cannot breathe when Black men and boys and women and girls are routinely profiled, abused, arrested, and killed with impunity by police officers. We must stop this. We must protect the lives of our young people -- all of them.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundIn a country that respected its own claims to be free, Sandra Bland would never have gone near the jail cell where she died. It is heartbreaking that it has taken another black death to concentrate our attention on the abuse of power that took her there: an abuse that is totally unacceptable and also utterly ordinary.Professor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027My friend, actor, singer-guitarist and composer, Paul Hipp, wrote the happy birthday song when he turned fifty. I loved it and asked if I could perform it as I turn ninety-three. Here is the result, and I don\u0027t care what you say, I love it.Founder, People for the American WayRemember why you\u0027re friends in the first place. Don\u0027t judge them for what they have -- what they wear, the trips they take, the house they live in -- but for who they are, and how they treat you.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarThe Fight for 15 movement is gaining momentum. It has won victories in Los Angeles, Los Angeles County, San Francisco, Seattle and SeaTac. This week, a New York State Wage Board formally recommended a $15.00 minimum wage for the fast food industry in New York.President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureI spoke with Till Roenneberg about the effects of \"social jet lag\" on our behavior and performance, the changes schools and companies can make to accommodate our biological needs, and the aggressive campaign required to take away the \"coolness\" of sleep deprivation.Associate Editor, The Huffington PostMedicare turns fifty next week. It was signed into law July 30, 1965 -- the crowning achievement of Lyndon Johnson\u0027s Great Society. It\u0027s more popular than ever. Yet Medicare continues to be blamed for America\u0027s present and future budget problems.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Sandra Bland\u0027s death is a horrific display of how vulnerable black people in this country are at the hands of law enforcement, and how indelicately black lives are publicly scrutinized for character flaws when that vulnerability results in death.Managing Director of Communications, Drug Policy AllianceWhile it may be accurate to say that a majority of the American public has \"moved on\" with regard to marriage equality, that\u0027s not true among the base of the GOP. And, more critically, the majority of Americans in general hasn\u0027t \"moved on\" when it comes to \"religious liberty\" vs. \"gay rights,\" not by a long shot.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostSomething extraordinary happened Thursday to advance fairness and equality in the United States. Members of Congress introduced legislation to amend the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 to embrace a more robust vision of equality.Deputy Legal Director of the ACLU and the Director of its Center for LibertyMuch remains to be done to secure the world from poverty, terrorism and fanaticism and environmental degradation. The United States is an important global actor in seeking, resourcing and implementing the solutions, and Kenya recognizes its role and responsibilities.President of KenyaSince seeing the Sandra Bland video, I\u0027ve been asking myself what I would\u0027ve done if I were in her shoes. In my mind, I hear my momma telling me, \"That\u0027s why I always tell you not to talk back to authority.\"Blog Editor, The Huffington PostOn this fifth anniversary of the Dodd-Frank Act, I wish I was writing a congratulatory letter to all the regulatory agencies in Washington, D.C. for its successful implementation. Instead, I\u0027m expressing the frustration of millions of working families who believe there is a lot of work still to be to done to rein in Wall Street excess.President, AFL-CIOIt is exciting to see our stories being told and winning awards, but should we be concerned that transgender people have little involvement in the story telling?Writer, thinker, social drinker.Like many people following the negotiations between Greece and its creditors, I was inclined to see Wolfgang Schauble, Germany\u0027s finance minister, as the villain of the story. Schauble did not argue for throwing Greece out of the euro simply as a punitive measure, although he quite obviously disapproved of the way Greece had run its budget and its economy.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027The advent of Islam sought not only to introduce a new kind of social order but to limit the excesses of Meccan society, which directly harmed women and girls. Early Islam sought to elevate women and define them as independent agents possessed of free will, responsible for their own actions and imbued with certain rights and privileges over men.Pakistani writer and journalistIt\u0027s time to be reasonable. It\u0027s time to respect each others\u0027 lives as much as we respect each others\u0027 rights. It\u0027s time to require training and screening for all firearms.Navy veteran and Co-Director of the Truman National Security Project San Diego ChapterLast week, the U.S. Department of Labor\u0027s Wage and Hour Division issued an important Administrator\u0027s Interpretation that provides clear and timely guidance on the question of who is properly considered an \"employee\" and covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act, and who is not.General Counsel \u0026 Program Director, National Employment Law ProjectMYKONOS -- The island blinks from afar like the most expensive jewel of the Mediterranean, an oasis distant from the turmoil of Greece\u0027s economic crisis.Professor of Comparative Literature, Queens CollegeI cry for my son when I sneak in his room at night and watch him sleep, marveling at all he has courageously accomplished as well as all he has yet to face.Wife, mother, educator, and chronic sufferer from anxiety, immaturity, and children. SammichesPsychMeds.comEncinia may have treated Bland differently because she was black. We can\u0027t read his mind. But it\u0027s much more likely he treated her the way he did because she didn\u0027t exhibit blind obedience to his every whim, something he was trained not to tolerate and Americans of all political persuasions seem to have acquiesced to without question.Author and columnistI\u0027m a girl who never says die. I\u0027ve lived on my own since I was 19, paid every one of my bills since I took my first job at 15 -- and I had to give up my financial independence three months ago, when I filed for disability.Writer. Entrepreneur. Cat savior. Drinker of rosé.Take a look at this video, in which a white male New York City police lieutenant grabbed a 6th grade elementary school student of color -- big for her age but only 11 years old -- around the neck and threw her to the pavement on a Bronx street corner, six months after Eric Garner was wrestled down on a Staten Island pavement.Civil Rights Lawyer and contributing opinion writerIn the past, he has advocated government health care, an assault weapons ban, and 14.25 percent flat tax on all wealthy Americans. Now he opposes all three. Does he stand for anything, other than promoting Donald Trump?Professor of Management Practice, Harvard Business SchoolUnfortunately, the more interested I am in getting to know a particular person, the worse this will be. If I really want someone to like me, I\u0027m extra careful with what I say, which then ends up being little or nothing at all.Writer, freelance editor, and occasional ukulele rocker.It is high time the American public demanded a full debate over veterans issues by their political leaders, especially those who aspire to the highest office in the land. But they are not going to get it when the candidates involved spent a lifetime either avoiding military service, or wrapping themselves in the glory of their own military service.Author, \u0027Dangerous Ground\u0027I chose my son because, when the moment came and I had the option, he felt like the only choice to make.Writer.
