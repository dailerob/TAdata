{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Why Bernanke to succeed Tim Geithner? He is probably the most influential and credible person in official Washington who is not part of the echo chamber on deficit reduction, and a Treasury secretary concerned more about recovery than austerity is just what Obama needs. And because the Fed, almost by definition, is assumed to be conservative, Bernanke would provide some cover for an expansionary program. I can think of people who\u0027d be even better than Bernanke but I can\u0027t think of anyone as good who stands a prayer of being nominated. It\u0027s nothing short of weird when the most reliable progressive in town around turns out to be the chairman of the Federal Reserve. But such are the reactionary times in which we live.Read Post | Comments (27)James Zogby, 11/17/12President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Since no one will win in the latest Middle East clash and everyone will lose, it might be assumed that sanity will prevail, and the current clashes will stop short of full-scale war. But given the record of the participants, that might be hoping for too much.Read Post | Comments (503)Gary Hart, 11/18/12President, Hart International, Ltd.It is impossible to avoid the conclusion that, sooner or later, a great moral confrontation will occur, where right must face wrong, where our unity as a nation will be tested and the need for an Abraham Lincoln will urgently arise. Will he or she be there?Read Post | Comments (74)Robert Reich, 11/18/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The best way to generate jobs and growth is for the government to spend more, not less. And for taxes to stay low -- or become even lower -- on the middle class.Read Post | Comments (165)HuffPost Radio, 11/18/12On our 100th show, Arianna Huffington and Mary Matalin debate the Republican re-set: Perhaps new GOP members should be required to watch Spielberg\u0027s Lincoln.Read Post | CommentsBob Herbert, 11/18/12Distinguished Senior Fellow at Demos, former New York Times columnistHenry Ford famously decided in 1914 to pay many of his workers the then incredible sum of five dollars a day, which was substantially higher than the prevailing wage at the time. Ford\u0027s revolutionary approach to industrial wages should now be applied to America\u0027s retail sector.Read Post | Comments (41)Evelyn Leopold, 11/16/12Veteran journalist reporting from the United NationsRegardless of the General Assembly vote, the Palestinians would remain stateless and remain under occupation in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. For Israel, the continued barrage of rockets is unacceptable not just to the government but to the public at large.Read Post | CommentsDr. Peggy Drexler, 11/17/12Author, research psychologist and gender scholarIf science is telling us that drinking while pregnant is okay, why do we continue to judge the woman with the outstretched belly sipping from a glass of Merlot?

Sadly, the Obama team hasn\u0027t even taken risks on the difficult issues of Cuba, Palestine, Sudan or Iran.Read Post | CommentsDaniel Gross, 11/18/12President, Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and the Brady Center to Prevent Gun ViolenceRemember the scene near the end of The Wizard of Oz, when Toto pulls back the curtain to expose that the powerful image of the Wizard was simply a projection of a rather ordinary, powerless old man? That happened Election Night with the NRA.Read Post | Comments (126)David Paul, 11/17/12President, Fiscal Strategies GroupThis should not be so hard. The fiscal cliff is nothing more than one more set of self-imposed deadlines that Congress put in place so that they could comply with their own rules. We have seen this before.Read Post | Comments (116)Jeffrey Lawrence and Luis Moreno-Caballud, 11/18/12Within the first week of setting up camp in Zucotti Park, people in Occupy started talking about the importance of systems of \"mutual aid\" rather than systems of \"charity.\" Charity means: \"I\u0027m fine, so I\u0027ll give you something.\" Mutual aid means: \"We\u0027re all in this together, so let\u0027s help each other out.\"Read Post | CommentsTammy Nelson, Ph.D., 11/17/12Sex and relationship expert; Psychotherapist; Author; International speakerIf monogamy fails more than half of the time, are we looking at a system that no longer serves our needs? Are we holding onto a romanticized notion of love and desire, hoping that we can get it right, but continuing to fail at it over and over again?Read Post | Comments (419)Dena Takruri, 11/18/12HuffPost Live ProducerThe producers of Up With Chris deserve praise for breaking from the conventional model of a fleeting segment featuring side-by-side talking heads that reduce the complex situation to two parties who are incapable of transcending their hatred for one another.Read Post | CommentsMichelangelo Signorile, 11/16/12Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesHad the Log Cabin Republicans not endorsed Romney, they would now have more pull within the GOP. They would be able to tell GOP leaders, in the midst of the handwringing over the party\u0027s \"demographic problem,\" that had Romney backed off his harsh line on gay rights, they could have helped him win.Read Post | Comments (383)Steven Strauss, 11/18/12Advanced Leadership Fellow, Harvard UniversityWeb 2.0 moves us closer to frictionless -- free, instantaneous -- communication.
