It\u0027s just the opposite.Read Post | CommentsMark Penn, 04.20.2010CEO, Burson-MarstellerThe administration\u0027s calculus that unpopular legislative success can translate into big November wins simply doesn\u0027t add up. Unless the administration finds a new strategy, they\u0027re facing electoral retribution on a scale unseen since 1994.Read Post | CommentsRobert Reich, 04.20.2010Former Secretary of Labor, Professor at BerkeleyThe Dodd bill now being considered in the Senate is a step in the right direction. Yet despite the hype, it\u0027s a very modest step. It leaves out three of the most important things we need.Read Post | CommentsRichard (RJ) Eskow, 04.19.2010Consultant, Writer, Policy AnalystIt turns out that AIG reportedly wanted to pay 60 cents on the dollar for Abacus deals it had insured, but Geither\u0027s New York Fed directed them to pay the full amount.Read Post | CommentsCarne Ross, 04.20.2010Independent diplomat and writerI reached Paris by train but there hit the buffers. The Gare d\u0027Austerlitz was a cacophony of frustration. Madrid was the only clear airport in Europe and the cloud threatened even there.Read Post | CommentsArianna Huffington, 04.19.2010While the SEC suit is certainly big news in itself, more important is what it says about what the financial elite has been doing to America for the last 30 years: shorting the middle class.Read Post | CommentsJosé Viñals, 04.20.2010Financial Counselor and Director of the IMF’s Monetary and Capital Markets DepartmentIf the legacy of the present crisis and emerging sovereign risks are not addressed, we run the very real risk of undermining the recovery and extending the financial crisis into a new phase.Read Post | CommentsPhil Bronstein, 04.20.2010Executive Vice President and Editor-at-Large, San Francisco ChronicleDespite Gates\u0027 decades-long technology reign, he\u0027s a fairly freshman social media user. So for a reasonable chunk of our 40-minute conversation yesterday, that\u0027s what we talked about.Read Post | CommentsMichael R. Bloomberg, 04.20.2010108th Mayor of the City of New YorkThe Gun Show Loophole is not a theoretical concern. Far too often, these illegal sales made through this loophole are arming criminals, leading to the deaths of innocent victims.Read Post | CommentsMarcia D. Greenberger, 04.20.2010Co-President, National Women\u0027s Law CenterEqual Pay Day: the day when the average woman, working all of 2009 and almost 4 months into 2010, earns what a man earns in 2009 alone. It makes me angry, but getting angry isn\u0027t nearly as good as getting the Paycheck Fairness Act passed.Read Post | CommentsDean Baker, 04.20.2010Co-Director of the Center for Economic and Policy ResearchPresident Obama is planning a big show soon that will include a number of experts talking about the need to reduce the deficit. And not one of them saw the housing bubble and the risks that it posed to the economy.Read Post | CommentsEmma Ruby-Sachs, 04.20.2010LawyerAs much as we dislike Obama\u0027s wishy washy approach to gay rights advocacy, Sen. Boxer is a staunch supporter of equality. If the protesters are serious perhaps they should spend time raising money for Boxer and her progressive agenda.Read Post | CommentsBill Maher, 04.20.2010Host of HBO\u0027s \"Real Time with Bill Maher\"Read Post | CommentsJames J. McCarthy, Ph.D. and Timothy Wirth, 04.20.2010The president should bring together scientists and others with relevant expertise for a White House summit on climate science, the urgency of action, and the opportunity for timely solutions.Read Post | CommentsSimon Johnson, 04.20.2010MIT Professor and co-author of 13 BankersMr. Dimon regards himself as just trying to make a reasonable case regarding what is sensible public policy regarding banking. We would welcome a debate with him in any forum, preferably in public and with TV cameras present.Read Post | CommentsLola Adesioye, 04.20.2010British, NY-based writer, thought leader and commentator.As the black community looks at the black agenda, we mustn\u0027t forget that women are part of that agenda and must continue to contribute to and be fully engaged in it.Read Post | CommentsAl Eisele, 04.19.2010Editor-at-Large of The HillI hear the expressions of rage directed towards Washington from the Tea Partiers and I wonder if there are more Oklahoma Cities in our future.Read Post | CommentsElizabeth Meltz, 04.20.2010Director of Food Safety and Sustainability, Batali/Bastianich Hospitality GroupEach of our chefs has created a menu or dish, essentially an interpretation of what Earth Day means to them.Read Post | CommentsIris Erlingsdottir, 04.20.2010Icelandic journalist and writerIt was inevitable.

Tom Harkin and Lilly Ledbetter, 04.20.2010On April 20th, Americans observe Equal Pay Day -- the date that marks the 110 extra days that women must work into 2010 in order to equal what men earned in 2009.Read Post | CommentsPeter Dreier and Jake Blumgart, 04.20.2010Armies of deep-pocketed lobbyists are marshaling astroturf front groups to give Coca-Cola and Pepsi\u0027s opposition to soda taxes a respectable air.Read Post | CommentsJohn Yemma, 04.20.2010Editor, Christian Science MonitorIt is no surprise that carbon offsets were concocted during the era of irrational exuberance. They are a low-cost, free-market way of assuaging guilt about global warming.Read Post | CommentsKristin Rowe-Finkbeiner, 04.20.2010Co-founder and Executive Director of www.momsrising.orgIt\u0027s ridiculous that modern women are still making less than men for the same work -- and Equal Pay Day will end when women and men are equally paid for equal work in each given year.Read Post | CommentsDavid Kirby, 04.20.2010Author/JournalistMichelle Obama is on a laudable food crusade, promoting the health benefits of fresh and sustainably grown nutrition. But her office doesn\u0027t want you to know what the Obamas had for dinner last night.Read Post | CommentsPaul Helmke, 04.20.2010President, Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun ViolenceIt was a strange thing, seeing guns carried within shooting distance of Reagan National Airport -- which was, of course, named after a president who was shot by an assassin.Read Post | CommentsRobert Reich, 04.20.2010José Viñals, 04.20.2010Mark Penn, 04.20.2010Peter Dreier, 04.20.2010James J.
