Should they do so?Political science professor, LaGrange College in GeorgiaScandal took the biggest leap in recent history by featuring a one-minute abortion procedure, which marked the first time since Roe vs. Wade that a main female TV character underwent the procedure. And it was not all that dramatic, which is the exact point we are trying to make about abortion.carafem, Vice PresidentI am tired of letting the loudest among us be those who call for un-American behavior in the name of patriotism. I am tired of letting the dialogue be monopolized by those who pass off prejudice as faith. Compassion matters. Dignity matters. Standing for something worthwhile is rarely easy.Coach, Consultant, Writer. Providing indivduals and organizations with the tools for well-beingI call upon all believers of equality to unite and to work to put an end to such acts of violence, injustice and discrimination against Iranian women.

Climate change is already a daily reality for my people, but without urgent global action to curb emissions, this growing crisis will spiral out of control.President of the Republic of the Marshall IslandsMy family\u0027s journey epitomizes the mythic American Dream.
