{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Founder and President, Constitutional Accountability CenterPresident Obama announced today that he will use his constitutional authority under the Recess Appointments Clause to push through vital political appointments. Partisans on each side in this matter will surely accuse the other of playing partisan dirty tricks. Senate Republicans have already accused the president of a power grab because, they claim, the pro-forma session means that the Senate is not technically in recess. The president\u0027s supporters will counter by saying that Republican Senators are using the trick of pro-forma sessions to strip the president of the recess appointment authority specifically provided to him by the Constitution. But if we consider legal precedents, it\u0027s likely that after all this partisan squabbling ends, the president may have the Chief Justice on his side.Read Post | Comments (148)Bob Cesca, 01/ 4/12Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez Show, Media ProducerRon Paul\u0027s progressive supporters might not grasp that Paul\u0027s libertarianism, while informing some of his seemingly progressive views on foreign policy and the like, carries with it a significant load of horrendous and unacceptable baggage.Read Post | Comments (687)Richard Cordray, 01/ 4/12Director of the Consumer Financial Protection BureauToday, I was appointed by President Obama to serve as the first Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
