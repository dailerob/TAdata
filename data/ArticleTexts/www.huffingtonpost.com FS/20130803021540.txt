{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"David BromwichProfessor of Literature, Yale UniversityThe contemporary notion of a \"trade-off\" between liberty and security assumes that life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are separable goods. They are separate in our experience, so the argument runs, and therefore they must be separate in our political calculations. But life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness were not so divisible in the eyes of the American founders. The words express as comprehensive a unity as faith, hope, and charity. We cannot imagine saying: \"I\u0027d like to abide by charity (or love) as much as possible, but any love I give too freely may drain my resources for hope of everlasting life. I only have so much energy, after all.\" A priest who talked of a trade-off between charity and hope would be suspected of not understanding the principle he was raised to believe in. The same is true of the presidents and security experts who talk of a trade-off between liberty and security.Comments (130)Dan DennettCognitive scientist and philosopherIt is a mistake to think that first there was sweetness, sexiness, and cuteness, and then we evolved to love these properties. That\u0027s just about backwardsComments (133)Elizabeth LicorishFreelance Writer and AuthorAt Lululemon, everything about you is inventoried and measured in terms of \"authenticity\" and \"integrity.\" Which sounds reasonable, until you realize your yoga mat\u0027s on a sweaty, slippery slope. In fact, according to Lululemon\u0027s standards, almost everyone is a lazy, sociopathic scumbag.Comments (54)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarWhile there\u0027s no longer a question of whether a woman can succeed in \"a man\u0027s world,\" statistics indicate that either the glass ceiling is thicker and lower than we imagined, or that younger women on the way up are finding a way out. Or, quite possibly, both.Comments (25)Mark GongloffChief financial writer, The Huffington PostIn answer to the question, \"Why on earth should Larry Summers be chairman of the Federal Reserve?\" his supporters usually allege that he is great in a crisis. Whether you believe that depends on your definition of \"great.\" In fact, there is plenty of evidence that Larry Summers is actually kind of terrible in a crisis.Comments (45)Joy GabrielWriter and momIs my body supposed to pretend it didn\u0027t rearrange all my organs and open my rib cage and my hips and grow a new human person and then proceed to feed and nourish that person from the very same body that delivered him, whole and perfect, into the world?Comments (118)Andrew ZimbalistRobert A. Woods Professor of Economics, Smith CollegeAlthough it is a favorite pastime among sportswriters to pick sides and make black-and-white arguments, it is sensible here to recognize that the issue of controlling artificial stimulants is and will continue to be enormously complex.CommentsRussell SimmonsFounder, GlobalGrind.comThe lucky ones, like you and me, owe a real explanation of the problems in our community to the ones who are still living in struggle, not some old, conservative talking points left in the garbage from Mitt Romney\u0027s campaign.Comments (384)Kim SimonMother, Wife, Blogger, mamabythebay.comI am a formula mom. I am a breastfeeding mom. I know what it feels like when your breasts \"let-down,\" and I know what it feels like when your heart \"lets-down.\" The beauty of our stories is that we are all feeding with love.Comments (128)Jordan K. TurgeonLifestyle Blog Editor, The Huffington PostFor me, health means strength. Health means trying each day to treat my body well. That kind of health goes beyond just diet and exercise. It comes in a variety of sizes. And if you don\u0027t carry that size in your store, I\u0027m happy to take my money elsewhere.Comments (26)Doug BandowSenior Fellow, the Cato InstituteWashington\u0027s best hope is to disengage, leaving Egyptians to decide their own future. The administration should simply point to the law. A coup has occurred and the democratic process has been overthrown by the military, so aid must be halted.Comments (118)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundMany Americans heed the CPSC and its recalls of dangerous products to help keep their families safe. But thanks in large part to the work of the gun lobby, guns are specifically not under the CPSC\u0027s jurisdiction and are the only consumer product not regulated for safety.Comments (35)Dr Raj Persaud and Adrian FurnhamWhat\u0027s chic, what\u0027s in and what\u0027s out, should be predicted by evolutionary theory. Otherwise it will be judged by history as just a passing phase. Eventually as outmoded as shoulder pads from the 1980s.Comments (65)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorAll told, today\u0027s jobs report is quite consistent with both recent job reports and the underlying pace of real GDP growth. We\u0027re growing, but at a pace that is only very slowly absorbing the slack that remains in the job market even as we\u0027re four years into the expansion that began in the second quarter of 2009.Comments (132)Sarah Koppelkamhopeave.wordpress.comHow to talk to your daughter about her body, step one: Don\u0027t talk to your daughter about her body, except to teach her how it works. Don\u0027t say anything if she\u0027s lost weight. Don\u0027t say anything if she\u0027s gained weight. Here are some things you can say instead.Comments (571)Sarah MunirWriterAnd that is where the problem arises. When negative images of your country become part of a global popular culture, subconsciously guilt becomes a part of the national conscience.Comments (41)Bob BurnettBerkeley writer, retired Silicon Valley executiveIt would seem that Republicans would want to adopt strategies that would strengthen their appeal to women -- particularly young women, a group they lost overwhelmingly. But instead they\u0027ve pursued their war on abortion rights with undiminished vigor.Comments (234)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027The battles over immigration reform and race have weighed heavily on me this summer. They have each become a symbol and a test, for me, of whether we can resurrect \"the common good\" in this nation.CommentsPaul SzepTwo-time Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonistComments (59)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorMitt Romney famously said during his most recent bid for the presidency: \"Corporations are people, my friend.\" Perhaps nothing else better surmises the state of our country than a prominent politician running for the presidency openly advancing such a flawed opinion.Comments (62)Kiki Von GlinowSenior Editor, HuffPost CelebrityWhile it may not be entirely legal for Americans to travel to Cuba, the \"green crocodile with eyes of stone and water\" (as Cuban poet Nicolás Guillén calls the island) could make the non-traditional customs experience a tempting one.Comments (40)Adam GrantWharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027The jury is still out on whether narcissism has in fact grown from one generation to the next. Frankly, it\u0027s hard to make any valid, reliable statements about what millions of people who happened to born in the same two decades have in common.Comments (17)Lauren HershNew York Office Director, Equality NowYou see, we\u0027ve always dreamed that one day, when we left our high school hallways, we\u0027d be free of certain painful things like standardized tests, Chaucer, and...slut-shaming. You brought us back to a heartbreaking, frustrating reality.CommentsAndy McDonaldFellow, The Huffington PostOkay, how about we compromise? I\u0027ll still throw out some disturbing statistics about the welfare of American children, but I\u0027ll punctuate them with some sweet ass alley-ooping pool dunks! Gooooooooo TEAM!CommentsSusanna QuinnWriterI\u0027m not suggesting for a moment that women are less capable than men of wrongdoing. But it is rather evident that women in politics seem vastly less inclined actually to fall victim to the temptations of sin.Comments (38)Shaker AamerPrisonnier britannique à GuantanamoMy name is Shaker. I am also known as Sawad Al-Madany because I was born in the Holy City of Medina. Please can you remember these names for me, because I hardly can anymore. Here, they call me 239. In fact, I call myself 239.Comments (509)Peter McGraw and Joel WarnerThe Humor CodeWhy else would we find things funny and laugh about them -- pretty unusual activities, when you think about it -- unless doing so helped us survive as a species?CommentsShawn Renee LentSocial practice dance artistI am dancing, with and for others. I am and will always be a dancer. I take that with me, in the ways I think, develop ideas, collaborate, move. I haven\u0027t been on a professional or semi-professional stage in six years, but I am a dancer. Because I say so.CommentsTom GilroyWriter/director/producerStart to organize now to Ignore The Olympics. Start Google groups, Facebook pages, and Instagram campaigns where you and yours commit to not only not watching the Olympics, but boycotting any company that sponsors them or advertises on the broadcast.CommentsJosh HorwitzExecutive Director, Coalition to Stop Gun ViolenceNational Rifle Association (NRA) CEO Wayne LaPierre once famously told a CPAC gathering that \"the guys with the guns make the rules.\" In the town of Gilberton, Pennsylvania, he might have finally found the perfect test case for his insane vision of America.Comments (526)Richard KirschSenior Fellow, Roosevelt Institute; author of \u0027Fighting for Our Health\u0027On Tuesday, President Obama gave a great speech on why good jobs are the foundation for his middle-out economic strategy... from a huge Amazon warehouse where the workers do not have good jobs. I\u0027m still stuck on the setting.Comments (34)Nigel Barber, 2013. 2.08Doug Bradley, 2013. 2.08Bob Greenstein, 2013. 2.08Victoria A.
