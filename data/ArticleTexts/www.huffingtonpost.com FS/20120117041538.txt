{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Today, the march for civil rights isn\u0027t about convincing Americans that racism is wrong. It is about getting money out of politics, so that the profit from institutional racism is eliminated. The Supreme Court\u0027s decision in Plessy vs. Ferguson saying \"separate but equal\" has been trumped by the Supreme Court\u0027s Citizens United decision, eliminating all restrictions on corporate cash in politics. If we are to honor Dr. King, let us make this our generation\u0027s cause. It won\u0027t be an easy fight, but as he said, \"The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.\"Read Post | Comments (450)James Moore, 1/16/12Author, \u0027Adios Mofo: Why Rick Perry Will Make America Miss George W.
