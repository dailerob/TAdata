{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Christian leader for social changeChuck Hagel is the first soldier of enlisted rank to ever be nominated as Secretary of Defense. Think about that. As an Army Sergeant, Hegal says he saw war from \"the bottom up.\" That is very different from the \"top down\" view of war that has always characterized the Pentagon and the military leaders who have sent so many young men and women to the bottom of so many horrible conflicts. Hagel says he wants to make absolutely sure that a projected war is worthy of the lives of American young men and women. Those wars of occupation have clearly failed -- as more and more Americans believe -- and they have caused such terrible destruction and suffering for so many American families, and the countless innocents from other countries who have perished in our wars.
