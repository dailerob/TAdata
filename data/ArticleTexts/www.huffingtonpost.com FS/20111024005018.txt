I\u0027m talking, of course, about the GOP debate in Las Vegas, which featured an intense, Spanish-flavored tango performed by Mitt Romney and Rick Perry (Romney, with his firm grip on Perry\u0027s shoulder, was clearly doing the leading).

El-Erian, 10/19/11CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOThe longer the policymaking impasse persists, the greater the stall-speed risk for an economy that already has an unemployment crisis, a large budget deficit, many underwater mortgages, and policy interest rates floored at zero.Read Post | Comments (141)Dylan Ratigan, 10/20/11Host, MSNBC\u0027s \u0027The Dylan Ratigan Show\u0027; Author, soon to be released \u0027Greedy Bastards\u0027I find it laughable to hear President Obama\u0027s spokesperson talking about how his campaign represents the 99%.Read Post | Comments (819)Conrad Black, 10/21/11Historian, publisher, authorMy admiration for Rupert Murdoch\u0027s boldness and acumen and our previous 25 years of more than civil relations make it unpleasant, despite his unspeakable assault on me, to have to conclude that he is deeply repressed and malicious man.Read Post | Comments (123)Marian Wright Edelman, 10/21/11President, Children\u0027s Defense Fund\"The Economy Stupid\" were the words on the now famous sign in successful presidential candidate Bill Clinton\u0027s 1992 war room.

Johnson, 10/17/11Entrepreneur, Philanthropist, FilmmakerWhat I\u0027m proposing isn\u0027t for the faint of heart. It requires corporations and philanthropists to stretch beyond easy, one-time emergency donations and short-term projects.

Ron Wyden, 10/17/11U.S. Senator from OregonIt\u0027s the State Department\u0027s job to decide if the Keystone XL pipeline is in the best interests of regular Americans who don\u0027t work for oil companies and American businesses that need oil to operate.
