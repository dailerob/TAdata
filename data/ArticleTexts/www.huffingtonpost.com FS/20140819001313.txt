{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"The first response most of us have to news of a suicide is: Why? And certainly the tragic death of Robin Williams was no exception. How could a man who brought so much joy and brightened the day for so many fail to feel the same thing for himself? Robin Williams\u0027 talent, his warmth, his energy, his generosity of spirit and his bigheartedness might have been singular, but his sad decision to take how own life was, unfortunately, all too common. And it\u0027s a heartbreaking decision that more and more people are making every year. So as we ask \"why\" about Robin Williams, we should also broaden the question. Why tens of thousands of people? What is happening that so many people make this irrevocable choice? What are we missing in our culture? How can we open up the conversation on this issue to make other choices seem more realistic and appealing?As I watched with a sickening sense of deja vu the images coming out of Ferguson, MO this week, I couldn\u0027t help but come to this conclusion: we have allowed a pernicious historical revisionism to undermine the legacy of the civil rights movement.Host, \u0027Dan Rather Presents\u0027As responsible citizens we must demand that our government exercise all influence to bring the Israeli government to honest, productive negotiations with the Palestinian unity government, to achieve lasting justice upon which an enduring peace, security, and prosperity can be achieved by all.Actor, producer and humanitarianDespite significant progress allowing tens of millions of children to enroll into school at the start of the millennium, a recent estimate suggested that at the current rate we must wait until 2086 for the last girl to have a primary education in Africa.Co-Founder, A World at School; Executive Chair, Global Business Coalition for EducationPresidents have been unwilling to name, much less remedy, the deep economic forces that are turning payroll jobs into what I\u0027ve termed \"The Task Rabbit Economy\" -- a collection of ad hoc gigs with no benefits, no job security, no career paths, and no employer reciprocity for worker diligence. But there are signs that maybe this issue is starting to break through.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027There is something deep in the American psyche which resents and resists military-style force in our neighborhoods.Former 16-year member of the U.S. Congress and two-time U.S. presidential candidateHow, in the modern age, can a state put on such sham proceedings, open to the world, and get away with it?Lawyer, activist and authorI distinctly remember thinking that if a few more minutes had gone by, he wouldn\u0027t have been holding a camera.Registered nurse behind the blog Adventures of a Labor Nurse: the Highs and Lows of Labor and DeliveryIf the court of public opinion has an impact on a jury\u0027s decisions, Texas Governor Rick Perry may have a chance of beating his indictments. Except that\u0027s not what this case is about.Best selling author, TV political analyst, communications and public relations expertOur society allows us to talk about depression openly when a celebrity or well-known person\u0027s struggle with it is revealed. That same society does not create a welcoming environment for an average person to talk about depression.Purveyor of Purpose, Be The Change RevolutionsAttacks on unarmed and innocent civilians continue to be a daily reality, without any end in sight. It\u0027s difficult to escape the conclusion that Darfur is the genocide that people got tired of. A terrible epitaph in the wake of so many impassioned declarations of \"never again.\"Professor at Smith CollegeRepublicans are going to be arguing one thing for Perry, and the exact opposite for Obama. This is going to become more and more obvious to all concerned.Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comYou would be surprised how painful sexual rejection is for men. Often, I see couples in which the man still remembers and is hurt by a sexual rejection occurring even years ago, at the start of the relationship.www.drpsychmom.comBoth explicit and implicit biases lead far too often to the killing of black men in police-civilian encounters. And they undergird the daily indignity and humiliation experienced by blacks who are stopped, questioned, and searched by police when they have done nothing wrong.Staff attorney for the ACLU’s Racial Justice ProgramWith Nouri al-Maliki agreeing to step aside, Iraq may have passed its first hurdle on the way to forming the kind of government that will be needed to defeat the Islamic State (IS). Passing this hurdle may also serve to vindicate the cautious approach the Obama Administration has taken in addressing the IS crisis.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027If the NAACP and other civil rights organizations really care about justice, accountability and activism, they\u0027ll change their bizarre stance on net neutrality. We would never know what was going on in Ferguson without a free and open Internet.AuthorIs anyone writing to you, teachers of Ferguson? Is anyone thinking about how you are sleeping, what you are telling your own children, and how you are going to greet a new group of students in the morning? I hope so.Assistant Professor, Urban Teacher Education at Michigan State UniversityWhat we must remember always -- and something I have told many juries in the past -- is that the most powerful person in the world, on a day-to-day basis, is not the president of the United States. No, it is a police officer.Civil rights lawyer with longstanding focus on law enforcement misconductEvery 10 seconds, non-stop, for a couple months, sonic explosions at 252 decibels will shatter eardrums of all sea creatures. Each month, the equivalent of 241,920 grenades will carpet-bomb the western Atlantic Ocean, minus any shrapnel.Broadcaster, Conservation BiologistThis is a generation that experiences animals, nature and the great wonders of our world behind the safety of four-inch screens instead of understanding how to live among them in reality.Executive editor, The DodoFerguson represents another step in the escalating failure of the \"broken windows\" view of crime that has gained ascendancy during the past generation.Macklin Fleming Professor of Law and Professor of Psychology, Yale Law SchoolWhat do low-income students get out of this? A chance to take an AP test. Not, mind you, more resources to get ready for it, nor do they get help with actually going to a college after taking the test (which may or may not give them any help once they get in).Teacher and writer; blogger, curmudgucation.blogspot.comSchool should be where children can feel secure and experience something approaching normal life, even as turbulence churns outside. And, perhaps even more importantly, it is where they can imagine and prepare for a future beyond their current situations.27th Prime Minister of AustraliaA fellow blogger and supporter of equal rights sent me a text that read, \"Where does the battle end? Isn\u0027t the ultimate victory call to call yourself a dad -- without a qualifier?\" Here is my response, to him and to the world.Dad, evolvequals.com blogger, LGBT activist and businessmanLike Emmett and Trayvon before him, the surrounding details are disputed.

The 21st century, which also arrived heralding peace and justice, is following in its predecessor\u0027s footsteps.Author, \u0027Children of the Days: A Calendar of Human History\u0027One day my grandson won\u0027t be six and little and cute. In fact, in 12 years, he\u0027ll be the age Michael Brown was on the last day of his life. And it won\u0027t matter what values his family has instilled in him, nor what the \"content of his character\" is.Acitivist and OrganizerNow I have found that others don\u0027t always find all the things you find beautiful about your child to be so beautiful, but I think that\u0027s where Leonard Bernstein comes in. Everyone around us saw it. Everyone felt it but none of us could name it.Scientist, nurse, artist, freedom fighterFerguson has resonated across the country, not because of the merits of this one particular interaction -- where the facts are still uncertain -- but because of other similar, but less deadly policing tactics in certain urban communities.Law professor UDC David A. Clarke School of LawIn a beautiful new film released this Friday on Netflix, oceanographer and explorer Sylvia Earle describes her underwater adventures.
