{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"APAPOn Sunday\u0027s Meet the Press, Tim Russert asked: \"If the president does try to recover, does try to reach out, will the Democrats join with him or will they resist him?\" So there you have it. If those damn Democrats stop resisting the president, we can all look forward to a big-idea, booming, bipartisan second term. Except, that is, for all those pesky people who don\u0027t like being lied to about the war, and don\u0027t like senior administration officials perjuring themselves to cover up their lies.READ POST | comments (114)10.31.2005 Ari EmanuelExactly what kind of subliminal message was the president trying to send by introducing Alito not in the Oval Office, as he did with Harriet Miers, but in the Cross Hall, a part of the White House no one has seen before?READ POST | comments10.31.2005 James K. GalbraithIf you were Libby, would you be confident that Cheney knows how to get his testimony just right? Because, if he doesn\u0027t, then his chances of being around on pardon day go down, do they not?READ POST | comments10.31.2005 Harry ShearerIt leaves a one in ten possibility that there\u0027s one more factor in the timing--it will totally wipe off the media map any coverage of today\u0027s White House visit by Silvio Berlusconi.READ POST | comments (17)10.31.2005 Bill ScherFor Sandra Day O\u0027Connor to be replaced by a man who has been defined as \"an activist conservatist judge [who] has looked to be creative in his conservatism\" will be a huge step backwards.READ POST | comments10.31.2005 Jerry and Joe LongIt is indeed a sad day for our nation when lying, perjury, and obstruction of justice can be interpreted by an activist prosecutor as somehow inconsistent with winning the war on terror.READ POST | comments10.31.2005 Wendy ButtonIs “Official A” concerned that “Official A” will replace “The Architect” as his nickname? Does “Official A” restore “honor and dignity” in the White House?READ POST | comments10.31.2005 Bob CescaIf the Bible is to be their template for determining morality, I wonder why so many of them are going to allow their children to participate in the anniversary of the pagan Celtic ritual of Samhain tonight.READ POST | comments (69)10.31.2005 Richard ValerianiIt\u0027s Halloween.

It was the electorate\u0027s job, and if someone feels that war-making is a huge wrong, criminalizing the war-makers is tempting but misguided.READ POST | comments (15)10.31.2005 Arthur Schlesinger Jr.Maybe Hillary should go to Iraq, as Ike went to Korea, and take along General Wes Clark -- a possible dream ticket for 2008.READ POST | comments (51)10.29.2005 Stephen SchlesingerOn his way out, did Scooter get a special \"inner circle\" handshake or some Rovian backroom deal?READ POST | comments (40)10.30.2005 Robert SchlesingerNote to self: If I\u0027m ever a high government official and under investigation, I want a rabid partisan on my trail.
