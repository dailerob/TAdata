{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranDonald Trump has a pattern, in pretty much every position that he takes with any issue. If you aren\u0027t winning fast, he wants to just brutalize the other side. Not winning on trade? Send in \"real killers\" to beat other countries into submission. Mexico not willing to build his wall? Build up the military and threaten them so they don\u0027t \u0027play war\u0027 with us. Progress against ISIS being made too slowly for your taste? Take it away Donald! But here is the funny thing. Until a few days ago, Donald Trump had one other position. That\u0027s right, he supported taking out innocent civilians, whose only \"crime\" was being related to a terrorist. That was his position, until General Michael Hayden told Bill Maher, \"If he were to order that once in government, the American armed forces would refuse to act.\" Suddenly, big, blustery Donald Trump wavered.At a Donald J. Trump campaign event March 9, 2016, my friend Rakeem and I saw what being American is all about. It has been unreal, distressing and nauseating. One of the main thoughts that remains in my head is, What if I didn\u0027t have my camera? Thank God I did.Music producer and musicianThe military has long prided itself on being a meritocracy, where those who serve are judged not based on who they are or where they come from, but rather what they have to offer to help defend this country. Today, we take yet another step toward that continued excellence.25th Secretary of the Department of DefenseDonald Trump is clearly appealing to our worst instincts, as many have said, but let\u0027s be more clear: Donald Trump is appealing to the worst instincts of white people, and American history has shown how ugly and violent those white instincts can be.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersWith depressing regularity, it keeps happening. A child, sometimes as young as a toddler, gets hold of a firearm (usually owned by a parent or other family member) and unintentionally pulls the trigger with horrific results.Executive Director, Violence Policy CenterAmerica\u0027s Cradle to Prison Pipeline is a toxic cocktail of poverty, illiteracy, racial disparities, violence and massive incarceration which sentences millions of children of color to social and economic death. Once young people have entered, to many they become just a statistic.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundTrump\u0027s scapegoating of Muslims, Hispanics, blacks and other \"others\" for political gain is exposing a racist ugliness, and dangerously inflaming it. Who knows how big the fire might get?Senior Editor, Huffington Post CanadaMuch as I\u0027m reluctant to further any infighting within the transgender and gender nonconforming community, I also have a responsibility to speak truth to power. Your visibility has gone from mildly annoying, to problematic, to atrocious, to outright detrimental, and so I ask you, politely: Stop trying to help though the media and public appearances.Trans* and GenderQueer-identified psychotherapist in the NYC area working with sexual/gender minority populations. www.LauraAJacobs.comThere must be a thorough outside investigation into how Perry and other FSU officials-including Jimbo Fisher, the FSU head football coach, and Monk Bonasorte, the Associate Director of athletics-colluded to protect Winston.Filmmaker, \"The Hunting Ground\"As my co-worker and I approached, we were not scared when the protesters yelled their misinformed opinions at us. We were emboldened by the blood of my ancestors which fertilized the fields of a nation not yet free for all.Young Philanthropist, Revolutionary, Teacher of Black EntrepreneurshipAs the news broke on March 7, 2016, that U.S. drone strikes had killed 150 people in Somalia, the White House announced it will reveal, for the first time, the number of people killed by drones and manned airstrikes \"outside areas of active hostilities\" since 2009. This is a critical first step toward much-needed transparency. But it will not go far enough.Professor, Thomas Jefferson School of LawWithout a muscular pushback from the public, the big airlines could claim the American airspace as their own to tax and regulate, without any significant compensation to the American taxpayer and no oversight from elected officials. Talk about getting skyjacked!Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorThe point that needs to be made and is often missed, when it comes to the utterances from the right-wing crazy train, is that the presidency is a real job and requires the person to fill that job to live in reality.Richard Zombeck is a freelance writer and a podcaster at TandZTalk.com.Let us be as comprehensive in our approach to addiction as it is in taking lives. Every stakeholder, physician, public official and addiction counselor I speak with is thrilled at the momentum and strategy revealed today.Cardiac Surgeon and Host of the Emmy-Award Winning \u0027The Dr. Oz Show\u0027What was supposed to be a family vacation turned into the nightmare of our lives when my father was kidnapped into a mysterious black car on the streets of Dubai. As we waited for the UAE government to sort out my father\u0027s unjust detainment, we realized that dead silence is not the answer.Daughter and human rights activistThe focus of the media was the \"civility\" of this debate compared to previous ones, combined with typical horse race speculations about which candidate won and which lost. Well, I can\u0027t tell you who won, but I can tell you who lost: the American people lost.Writer, Professor, Retired Lt. Colonel, Air ForceAs an ER doctor, I\u0027ve seen countless patients whose lives were saved by a quick-thinking and knowledgeable bystander or loved one. We never know where life may lead -- and every single one of us can learn these life-saving techniques. (Cue ER theme music).ER doctor, MBA, TV \u0026 Media Medical Expert, MomBinney spent over 30 years at the National Security Agency as a high-ranked official and left in 2002 after criticizing the agency\u0027s system for collecting data on Americans.Editor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027They Know Everything About You\u0027But once we settle on this axiom -- no god-powers to Donald Trump, ever -- the fact remains that even if he were to become president the world will remain much larger and more inscrutable than someone like Donald Trump (whose truly unhandsome reflection consumes his entire universe) can even fractionally comprehend.Writer. Philosopher. Reluctant Entrepreneur.I have so many things that I want to say to you, more than I can address in this post. While I haven\u0027t personally sat down and talked to Chrissy I\u0027m currently walking in her shoes, (minus the whole supermodel thing) and have a few choice opinions on this subject.Seattle Life and Style BloggerYes, I have Parkinson\u0027s disease and I tried out for American Ninja Warrior. Yes, I would love to be on the show for a multitude of reasons. However, what I\u0027ve learned training to be a ninja has far outweighed the benefits of being on TV.Single Mom, Blogger, Social Media Network Creator, Motivational Speaker, Fitness Enthusiast, Mud Runner, Parkinson\u0027s Patient and OvercomerI can\u0027t speak for them, or for anyone else, but when my sense of the natural order of things left, I acquired the heaviness of grief... and an immense amount of fear. Now that nothing makes sense, I am afraid of everything.Advertising writer, parent and parenting blogger living in Omaha, Nebraska, with her husband and two young daughters.I\u0027ve heard people say cussing is a morality issue. It\u0027s not. Our daughter is a good person. She is responsible at home. She knows swearing does not make a person bad. Being disrespectful and treating others poorly makes them bad. To us, these issues are separate.Writer, MotherAlthough Governor Kasich has trailed Trump in most all of the polls in his home state, he has recently gained ground and the endorsement by Ohio State football coach, Urban Meyer, will greatly improve his chances on Tuesday.Professor of Political Science at Ohio Northern University, optimist, pragmatist, and advocate for centrist politicsIn a perfect world, Bob the Drag Queen from the latest season of RuPaul\u0027s Drag Race would be elected President of the United States. But until we reach that beautiful day, we must evaluate each candidate\u0027s flits and specks of gayness.Satire \u0026 Comedy from The Second CityThe real story will be revealed only if she releases the transcripts from the three speeches she gave to Goldman Sachs for which she was paid $675,000. Her unwillingness to do so strongly suggests she has something to hide. What did she really say? Here\u0027s a reconstruction.Author, \"Runaway Inequality: An Activist\u0027s Guide to Economic Justice\"I have heard more times than I can count, especially since the start of the Vienna peace process on Syria last November, that Syrians are simply \"tired of war\" and that it is time to give up on the Syrian Revolution\u0027s core demand for the departure of the Assad dictatorship.Senior political adviser and government relations director, Syrian American Council in WashingtonFirst, I would like to thank most of you for finally accepting gay men and the rest of the LGBT community. It\u0027s hard to believe that just 20 years ago -- even 15 -- many of you told us we were sinners and deserved to die of AIDS.Actor, Writer, Pop Culture Enthusiast, Technology AddictBlack women and girls should not be killed in jail in America. Not under any circumstances. And the last thing their families should have to do is fight for answers. What exactly are they hiding? And why exactly are we tolerating it?Associate professor and associate chair of the African and African Diaspora Studies Department at The University of Texas at AustinWe write to you as scholars of American history, politics, and the law.
