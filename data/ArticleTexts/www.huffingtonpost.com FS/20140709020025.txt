{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteThe morning of June 28, 1914 dawned bright for most Europeans. By sunset a geopolitical cataclysm loomed. World War I demonstrated the importance of saying no. Any of the great powers could have stopped the march toward war. America could have refused to join the parade after it started. The world would have been a better place had one or all done so. Today, Washington is filled with routine proposals for new interventions: bombing campaigns, foreign invasions, and military occupations. Most seem unlikely to trigger a new world war. But a century ago no one expected an assassination in a distant Balkan province to do so either. That is reason enough for Americans to make war truly a last resort.Eight months ago, we challenged people to launch a brand new business and start selling. When they entered the competition, each participant chose a category best describing their shop. The store that sold the most in each category during a two-month period would take home the prize.Chief Platform Officer of ShopifyPeople who feel isolated and powerless cease to be creative and productive. These are immutable truths. And we can only start to solve them when address our feelings of distress with the respect they deserve.Author, \"The Athena Doctrine: How Women (And The Men Who Think Like Them) Will Rule The Future\"Author, writer, horsemanWhile government clearly plays the major role in fighting poverty through policies on things such as education, tax and trade; business creates the wealth that matters.Group Chief Executive Officer of UBSEach new day offers a new experience and a new chance to try something different. It is refreshing, but it is also innocent and child-like. But there is little that is truly new and different and the circularity of human experience gives fate the opportunity to come back and bite us.United States Senator (Ret.)The world is aflame with new or intensifying conflicts. At first glance, these upheavals appear to be driven by their own idiosyncratic circumstances. But look more closely and they share several key characteristics -- notably, a witch\u0027s brew of ethnic, religious, and national antagonisms that have been stirred to the boiling point by a fixation on energy.Author and Professor of Peace and World-Security Studies, Hampshire CollegeThis is a freedom that workers in every other wealthy country have long enjoyed; now workers in the United States no longer need a full-time job to get health insurance. And the data indicate that many workers are taking advantage of this option.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Whether they\u0027re eating a bowl of kibble or chasing a ball, dogs live for the present moment. The past is gone; you can\u0027t do anything about it. The future is unknown. The only thing you can really enjoy and affect is the present moment.President \u0026 CEO, Stillheart Institute; Author; SpeakerWhen I was first diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes more than 25 years ago, I had no health insurance. And due to my young adult perspective and extreme naiveté about managing my diabetes condition, I believed that very little about my personal life would change with my diagnosis. I guess ignorance is bliss, but ignorance can also cause the eventual reality to be that much more painful.Writer, Diabetes AdvocateWho is the true patriot, Hillary Clinton or Edward Snowden? The question comes up because Clinton has gone all out in attacking Snowden as a means of burnishing her hawkish credentials, eliciting Glenn Greenwald\u0027s comment that she is \"like a neocon, practically.\"Editor,Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027They couldn\u0027t find anything for the DTaP vaccine or the HIB vaccine. They couldn\u0027t find any association with autism. And they couldn\u0027t find any risk from giving a lot of vaccines at once; in fact, one study found that getting several vaccines may help protect children against leukemia.Pediatrician, Boston Children\u0027s Hospital, Harvard Medical SchoolOne thing about the gun debate I find interesting is how quickly and easily gun owners get riled up when politicians, or anyone else for that matter, begin talking about taking away their guns.Mike the Gun Guy\"The numbers add up.\" But what of the lesser numbers -- the ones that are, well, less than prime -- and hence, don\u0027t quite add up? Was there anyone who would speak for them?Public education advocate and blogger, EduShysterThe TPP is a massive deal between 12 Pacific countries that could have a resounding impact on hundreds of millions of lives. Like similar agreements, it has been negotiated at expensive, luxurious hotels around the world, where trade delegates secretly meet to make high-stakes deals between their nations.Global Policy Analyst at the Electronic Frontier FoundationTypos have been causing embarrassment, angst, tension and torment for as long as we\u0027ve been writing -- long before the typewriter, and even the printing press.Author, \u0027Just My Typo\u0027It was good to hear President Obama say that reining in Wall Street\u0027s high-risk behavior is an \"unfinished piece of business.\" It would be even better if this observation were quickly followed by action -- the kind of concrete action he can take immediately, with or without Congress\u0027s cooperation.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourSo there it was... this input field with a pulsating cursor, waiting for me to type a password that I\u0027ll have to re-enter for the next 30 days. Then, letting all the frustration go, I remembered a tip I heard from my former boss. I\u0027m gonna use a password to change my life.Associate Creative Director, EF Education FirstThe Stop Corporate Expatriation and Invest in America\u0027s Infrastructure Act will put an end to tax-avoiding corporate expatriations and devote the resulting revenue to the Highway Trust Fund, which will address the immediate funding crisis facing America\u0027s highway and transit systems this summer.Sandy Levin is the Ranking Member of the House Ways and Means CommitteeIn the world of international soccer, four years is an eternity, but looking ahead to the 2018 World Cup in Russia provides both an intriguing window in to the future of the U.S. Men\u0027s National Team as well as a much needed catharsis for those still reeling from the team\u0027s dismissal a week ago.Sports writer, proponent of Intercollegiate AthleticsFollowing the horrific murders of Israeli and Palestinian teens, it is time for people on both sides to rise up in silent joint and simultaneous protest against all forms of political violence.JournalistENDA would allow a Catholic hospital or school to fire a lesbian nurse or janitor or cafeteria cashier simply on the basis of her sexual orientation. That is a much broader exemption than allowed for any other group under the 1964 Civil Rights Act. And it\u0027s abhorrent.Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesAlmost every mother I know lost her shame at the hospital, and it\u0027s a darn good thing because you can\u0027t afford to have much of it when you\u0027re a mom.Blogger, Pile of BabiesWhat Facebook did pales in comparison to what Madison Avenue and the marketing departments of corporations from Amazon to Zales do every day of the week, during the weekends, and especially during holidays.Professor of international relations, George Washington UniversityWhen I was holding her in those last moments as her breaths slowed, her eyes, which had half shut and glazed, suddenly opened, focused on me and then beyond me.Executive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostThe idea that something as serious as World Series home-field advantage will be decided by a hobbled Derek Jeter starting at short or possibly without White Sox ace Chris Sale is infuriating to any fan of the game. I\u0027ll highlight the biggest problems with this year\u0027s All-Star crew.For the first time, a large fraction of the world\u0027s fossil fuels could be replaced at a lower cost by clean energy, with today\u0027s renewable technologies and prices. And virtually no further investments in fossil fuels make long-term economic sense.Former executive director and chairman, Sierra ClubYou tend to have more focused conversations, because you\u0027re literally tethered in place. You\u0027re attached to the phone, and the phone is attached to the wall. And you can\u0027t go anywhere, so you end up sitting and staring at the phone itself -- and just listening.AuthorIt is nothing short of disgusting that the self-proclaimed \"greatest country on earth\" is engaged in a vehement discussion on minimum wages.Richard Zombeck is a freelance writer for hire living in the Boston area and hangs out at www.zombeckink.comWhen you think about it, the burrito might be the world\u0027s most perfect food.TheDailyMeal.comWellness, and how to integrate it into our work lives, has become the hottest topic in the business pages.
