On Friday, Maine Judge Charles LaVerdiere rejected efforts of state officials to restrict Hickcox to her home, citing the \"misinformation\" and \"bad science\" being spread about Ebola. This came a day after Hickox, who treated Ebola patients in Sierra Leone but is symptom-free, took the most media-covered bike ride outside the Tour de France. If Maine seeks another order, it should be one thanking Hickox for making us safer, since the way to beat Ebola is to stop it in Africa -- not by disincentivizing heroic medical workers willing to help. With Maine\u0027s Paul LePage joining Chris Christie as governors the courageous nurse has used science to vanquish, kids looking for a real superhero to emulate next Halloween should ready their Kaci Hickox costumes.America\u0027s incarceration addiction has torn apart communities, disenfranchised millions of people -- most for nonviolent offenses -- and denied opportunities to countless individuals.

Rather, Washington attempts to do too much with the amount that it spends on the military. America\u0027s policy of promiscuous foreign intervention would be foolish even if it was not costly. But it is both.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteBeing a mother has reinforced and refined my thinking on many issues, including -- believe it or not -- our criminal justice system. That\u0027s why I\u0027m supporting Proposition 47, a California voter initiative that will restore balance to how we approach community safety.ActressOur queer ancestors, the ones who fought at Stonewall and marched on Washington and were arrested and beaten and murdered for their queerness, weren\u0027t battling so that we could be like everyone else.

All eyes are on California voters when it comes to addressing the ongoing crisis of medical malpractice in the United States. Whereas MICRA served as a bad example to the nation, let us now reverse the tide and set out on a positive path.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorEnding child poverty in the world\u0027s largest economy should be a no-brainer. Children cannot afford the burden of poverty. And our nation cannot afford the costly economic and moral burden of child poverty.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundWe need to be able to track what fish we are eating, where and how our seafood is caught or farmed, and see this information follow seafood through the entire supply chain, from boat to plate.ActorCEO, OceanaThe incident that changed everything was on a Sunday night. The evening started out fine, we had a drink, we smoked some pot, we hung out chatting and a while later we started kissing. Suddenly, it was like he became a different person. He was super angry, almost frenzied and disassociated.Lawyer, Author \u0027The Mom Shift\u0027Because we\u0027re reluctant to talk about our own vanity-driven alterations, we tend to want to dismiss and condemn those of others. The real objection to Zellweger\u0027s new face isn\u0027t that she has one. The objection is that we can\u0027t pretend it didn\u0027t happen.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarEven if you believe that your single vote does not matter, and this happens for various reasons, you still are obliged to cast a vote on very important grounds.Host and Producer of Between the Lines with Barry Kibrick seen on PBS.We overwhelmingly believe these things -- from our CEOs to our local leaders to our elected representatives.
