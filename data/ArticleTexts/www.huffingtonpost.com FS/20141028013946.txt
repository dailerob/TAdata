But he never hit me.Writer of all things feminism, public policy, law and politics. J.D., M.A. and an unbridled curiosity. Follow on Twitter @reutamitBecause we\u0027re reluctant to talk about our own vanity-driven alterations, we tend to want to dismiss and condemn those of others. The real objection to Zellweger\u0027s new face isn\u0027t that she has one.
