{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027It\u0027s often assumed that people are paid what they\u0027re worth. According to this logic, minimum wage workers aren\u0027t worth more than the $7.25 an hour they now receive. If they were worth more, they\u0027d earn more. According to this same logic, CEOs of big companies are worth their giant compensation packages, now averaging 300 times the pay of the typical American worker. They must be worth it or they wouldn\u0027t be paid this much. Fifty years ago, when General Motors was the largest employer in America, the typical GM worker got paid $35 an hour in today\u0027s dollars. Today, America\u0027s largest employer is Walmart, and the typical Walmart worker earns $8.80 an hour. Does this mean the typical GM employee a half-century ago was worth four times what today\u0027s typical Walmart employee is worth?Comments (537)TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"If thinking of cerebral palsy makes you think of someone sad or helpless, then watch this talk and let comedian Maysoon Zayid blow your mind. She\u0027s fierce, she\u0027s funny, and she refuses to let you feel sorry for her.Comments (30)Noah MichelsonExecutive Editor, HuffPost Gay VoicesAs you can imagine, anyone with half a brain was pissed about Ezra Klein\u0027s decision to hire Brandon Ambrosino. Why, oh why, when there are so many brilliant young queer writers doing such amazing work, would he choose this guy?Comments (44)Diane RavitchResearch Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027Wall Street loves charter schools. Andrew Cuomo wants to be re-elected governor of New York with a large majority. One of his biggest sources of money is Wall Street. Cuomo now wants to take charge of dispensing millions in public funds to charter schools for construction, and he wants to assure them that they can have public space without paying rent.Comments (171)Robin LakoffProfessor of linguistics emerita, University of California, BerkeleyWe need to understand why a word like \u0027bossy\u0027 exists with its current meaning, and change the world that makes it meaningful and useful.Comments (54)Tim StobierskiAspiring author and editorStudents around the country have families who have been evicted from homes; parents who have used their retirement accounts to pay the mortgage until it ran dry; rent and student loan payments that leave them with less than 50 dollars a month with which to buy food.Comments (23)Alan SingerSocial studies educator, Hofstra UniversityThe reading list for the New York State Common Core English/Language Arts curriculum looks like someone took a handful of darts and threw them at a wall with boxes labeled with different grade levels. There are no discernible themes and at a first glance no patterns at all.CommentsMarian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe sad truth is you can work full time in America and not be able to meet your family\u0027s basic needs. A parent working full time at the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour earns $15,080 a year before taxes. That\u0027s $4,700 below the poverty level for a parent with two children.CommentsRalph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorWall Street gamblers are still paid huge money and are again creeping toward reckless misbehavior. Their corporate crime wave strip-mined the economy for young workers and is draining away their ability to afford basic goods.CommentsKrista BarthAttorneyWhy do people marry people they know are unkind, unfaithful, selfish, or without common values or interests?CommentsPatrick SmithAirline pilot, air travel columnist and authorIt\u0027s fascinating how this story has moved from being one about a presumed airplane crash to, really, a mystery story. It\u0027s the very missing-ness of the plane that the public finds so captivating.CommentsLinda VarleseEditor, HuffPost ItalyNot a day goes by that I don\u0027t look for him in other people\u0027s faces. Not a day goes by that I don\u0027t grasp to hold the memories together. Not a day goes by that I don\u0027t try to hear his voice again so that I won\u0027t lose it. Not a day goes by that I don\u0027t try to question him for the answers to my doubts.CommentsDavid SchanzerAssociate Professor of the Practice, Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University, Director, Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland SecurityOur nation needs an effective and unburdened CIA, a restoration of trust between the branches of government, and an opportunity to reassert our moral leadership internationally in pursuit of a more just and peaceful world. To do this, secrecy about the mistakes of the past must end.CommentsAlison SpiegelAssociate Editor, HuffPost TasteCompetitive food shows strip cooking of its best parts.Comments (35)Evelyn LeopoldVeteran journalist reporting from the United NationsWith the third anniversary of the Syrian uprising this week, refugees are still pouring into neighboring states, food is used as a weapon of war and peace talks are stalled -- perhaps forever.CommentsJohn FefferCo-director, Foreign Policy In FocusI don\u0027t blame you for being just a little confused about the different claimants to the mantle of \"the people\" in the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine, Venezuela, and Egypt. In all three cases, people went to the polls and elected governments, and then the people went out onto the streets to reject those very same governments.CommentsCamille RiveraExecutive Director, UnitedNYMoskowitz is trying to paint herself as a defender of black and Latino children, but really her war on Mayor Bill de Blasio is not about children or civil rights. It\u0027s about Moskowitz wanting more power, more profit for her 22 schools and demanding to get everything she wants.Comments (71)Ellen SeidmanI blog about kids with special needs, I mother, I work as a magazine editor, breatheSadly, the differences are often all that people see when they meet him. Forget rose-colored glasses; people peer at my child through the lens of disability. Oftentimes, they regret that he has cerebral palsy. This I can tell from the pity stares or pity-speak.CommentsHulu.comWatchers of Good TVSince our backs are usually nestled in between couch cushions in front of the TV, we actually feel pretty safe. But we know a few people out there in TV Land who definitely deserve to be taken down a notch or two, and we have just the recipe for each one.CommentsMichael KayRetired British officer/pilot in NYC; Expert on the instruments of Foreign PolicyIt may be too late for the U.S. administration to salvage Crimea in the short term. But crafting an energy strategy that bolsters future geopolitical security for Europe and Ukraine would exploit the homemade crevasse in Putin\u0027s armor.CommentsRob ReinaldaWriter/editor; 28 years in newspapersIn the game of Telephone, by the time the message reaches the last player in the queue, it usually bears little resemblance to the initial utterance. With that in mind, here are some words that many people use frequently -- and incorrectly.Comments (91)Lauren Sudeall LucasAssistant professor at the Georgia State University College of LawThe increasingly secretive nature of punishment in the U.S. suppresses much needed discussion about how we choose to punish those convicted of a crimeCommentsLisa BloomLegal analyst for NBC News and Avvo.com, attorney and bestselling authorWe\u0027re in the midst of a series of high-profile trials of white Americans who fatally shot unarmed African Americans, which we are constantly told are not about race. Not only is this a losing strategy for the prosecution, but it\u0027s dishonest.Comments (155)Peter DreierE.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeAlbert Einstein was a reluctant celebrity, but he recognized that he could use his fame to promote causes to make the world more humane and democratic. Today -- when both science and democracy are under attack by right-wing forces -- Einstein\u0027s voice as both a scientist and citizen are sorely missed.CommentsJessica R.After the insurance company first denied me birth control, I made an appointment with the Human Resources director. I assumed it was a problem with the insurance company. Boy, was I wrong. The director told me that birth control is something the university should never be expected to cover, and that I should be more responsible for my reproduction and \"proud\" of my child.Comments (62)Cyd ZeiglerCo-founder, Outsports.comI have big issues with Ambrosino\u0027s writing. He\u0027s me 10 years ago -- and I don\u0027t love a lot of what I wrote then, either. Let\u0027s see if he can learn what I learned.CommentsH. Alan ScottWriter, Comedian, ManEven though there\u0027s so much gay representation on TV, many of these characters are one dimensional. Here\u0027s a list of gay artists creating content on the Internet that is honest, sometimes funny, sometimes sad, and always original.CommentsErica PayneAgenda Project Founder and President, public policy expert, commentator, author, and strategistIn two weeks, the U.S. Senate will vote on a bill to raise the minimum wage. This would shrink the gender wage gap by nearly five percent. So where is the multimillionaire author of the self-professed feminist manifesto?CommentsTony PosnanskiWriter, \u0027The Anti-Jared\u0027Once question remained: Was I the guy on the Westview track that afternoon? In every picture it was a woman. The time frame of my weight loss story does not fit with the original. I write a lot; that would be very strange if it was about me. Here is my answer.CommentsDavid BelkBoard Certified in Internal MedicineIf these medications don\u0027t cost very much, if they don\u0027t cost the insurance companies anything, why the denials? And what does this tell us about the role of health insurance in our lives?Comments (95)Terry RichardsonPhotographer, artist, and directorEnabled and protected by the freewheeling and often times anonymous nature of the Internet, people have become comfortable concocting hate-filled and libelous tales about my professional and personal lives. In writing this, I make a humble attempt at correcting these rumors.Comments (16)Ralph Nader, 2014.14.03Ira Israel, 2014.14.03Gregory P.
