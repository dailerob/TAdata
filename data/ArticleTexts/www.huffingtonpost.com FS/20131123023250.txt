{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Paul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostAs I watch the footage of the grief-stricken people who lined the streets, I can\u0027t help but feel a nostalgia for that horrible time because it seems to me that it represents an America more unified than today. I can\u0027t shake the monstrous feeling that if President Obama was shot, or President Bush before him, that there would be large numbers of Americans rejoicing. I worry that because of our rhetoric and poisoned political atmosphere that we have weakened our country; and the fracturing that began 50 years ago has developed into canyons that divide us. Perhaps that is why 9/11, for all its horror and repercussions is my generation\u0027s equivalent of John F. Kennedy\u0027s assassination. Not because tragedy of assassination and terrorism are equivalent, but because the response can be, and was.Comments (100)TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"Psychologist Kelly McGonigal shares new research showing that it\u0027s our thinking about stress, rather than stress itself, that affects our health.Comments (95)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027The Republicans have created a tempest out of trivialities. It is incumbent on Democrats -- from the president on down -- to show Americans the larger picture, and so so again and again.Comments (39)Gary HartPresident, Hart International, Ltd.For those of us powerfully motivated toward public service by the Kennedy challenge to our idealism, one not heard since then, we choose to believe that he had the potential to become that rare political leader beyond politics, certainly beyond partisanship.Comments (22)Trita ParsiPresident, National Iranian American CouncilJust as Iran must accept certain limitations for a period time as a result of their past violations and the breach in trust, the West must accept that once Iran has restored trust, it must enjoy the same benefits that all other NPT states enjoy.Comments (15)Linda TiradoNight Cook, Essayist, ActivistWe know that the very act of being poor guarantees that we will never not be poor. It doesn\u0027t give us much reason to improve ourselves.Comments (264)Chris GentilvisoSenior Politics Editor, The Huffington PostWith two decades of hindsight in our favor, it\u0027s worth taking a few moments today to think about what the big screen showed us in 1993, and where those issues stand now.Comments (14)Jamie Lee CurtisActress and children\u0027s book authorThat is the Kennedy I like to think of when everyone asks, \"Where were you when you heard JFK was shot.\" I was at my own birthday party with balloons and a Barbie cake with five glowing candles and presents and games and an understanding that something enormous had shifted in the universe and my happy birthday would never be truly happy again.Comments (59)Diane RavitchHistorian, NYU professorIt seems to me that we are thinking about children, teachers, and schools the same way we think about sports teams. In every league, there are winners and losers. But what if we thought of schools as if they were akin to families?CommentsErin RuberryManaging blog editor, The Huffington Post; Contributing editor, HuffPost DCThe sign stopped me in my tracks: \"Since 2004, six people have died falling from the cliffs on this route.\" I promptly texted a photo of the warning to my mom back home in Maryland and continued along the trail.CommentsDoug KendallFounder and President, Constitutional Accountability CenterOur federal government was designed as a republic. Within this system, and over time, elections were to have consequences and enlightened public opinion was to govern.Comments (687)Edward Jay EpsteinAuthor, \u0027The Annals of Unsolved Crime\u0027The possibility that Lee Harvey Oswald had assistance can never be precluded. But the real question is not how but why Oswald assassinated the president. His death ended the hope of unraveling his motive.Comments (139)Mark ShriverSenior Vice President for Strategic Initiatives, Save the ChildrenToday marks the 50th anniversary of President Kennedy\u0027s death, yet just 10 days ago, Jeanne and I were celebrating with my cousin Caroline Kennedy as she was sworn in as Ambassador to Japan.CommentsLester \u0026 CharliePolitical satiristsWow. We\u0027ve lived in this era of unchecked corporate greed for a while now. So it\u0027s rare that a company\u0027s actions take our breath away. But there you have it. The McDonald\u0027s hotline stopped just short of pointing out how much cheaper it is to kill yourself.Comments (190)Mark R. KennedyProfessor of political management and director of the Graduate School of Political Management, George Washington UniversityCentral to the Kennedy ideal is the idea of self-sacrifice for the greater good. In this day of political intransigence and not only inter-party, but also intra-party strife, blame seems to supplant earnest dialogue, and Kennedy\u0027s call appears long forgotten.CommentsMatt WalshBlogger, talk radio host, father of twinsThat\u0027s our entire economic system: buy things. Everybody buy. It doesn\u0027t matter what you buy. Just buy. How appropriate, then, that a holiday created by our ancestors as an occasion to give thanks for what they had, now morphs into a frenzied consumerist ritual where we descend upon shopping malls to accumulate more things we don\u0027t need.Comments (505)Joan GageA Rolling CroneEveryone who was older than, say, five, on November 22, 1963 has a story that begins, \u0027On the day that Kennedy was shot, I...\u0027 Those too young to remember it have filed away Kennedy\u0027s murder in their minds along with other national tragedies: the assassination of President Lincoln, the Hindenburg disaster, Pearl Harbor, the sinking of the Titanic, the San Francisco earthquake.CommentsPaul RieckhoffFounder, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of AmericaSenate gridlock and dysfunction has reared its ugly head again -- and this time it\u0027s survivors of military sexual assault who will pay the price.CommentsAnthony LappéNY-based author, television producer and media commentatorJFK WTF? you say.

Kennedy had been shot.CommentsMichael Friedman, L.M.S.W.Adjunct Associate Professor, Columbia University Schools of Social Work and Public HealthStressful events can bring out the best in us, lift us to levels we never thought possible. We can rise to the occasion. But, it\u0027s not quite that simple, is it?CommentsEric BarryComedian, writer and creator of the \u0027Full Disclosure\u0027 sex podcast and blog.Some people will argue that if these women really mattered, a list wouldn\u0027t be necessary. Most of these people couldn\u0027t tell you the phone number of the person they\u0027re dating, or the birth dates of some of their closest friends, because ya know, they have a list that stores that information.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorWe know that the economy\u0027s been growing and that company profits have been high. There\u0027s nothing wrong with profits, but there\u0027s definitely something wrong when they fail to lead to employment and earnings gains for the broad majority.Comments (90)Dr. Jill BidenSecond Lady of the United StatesThrough the power of mentoring, TechWomen brings together female scientists, technologists, engineers, and mathematicians who can work to resolve our world\u0027s most pressing issues, making the world we share a better place, one woman at a time.CommentsKathy CalvinPresident and CEO, the United Nations FoundationOne of the reasons we need a \"Plan B for business\" is that companies today need to find ways to work together, to drive well-being for all and conserve the earth\u0027s precious resources.CommentsKathariya Mokrue, PhDLicensed clinical psychologistWho wants to feel their bodies gearing up to \"fight or flight\" where the heart races, blood pressure spikes, breathing becomes shallow and irregular, face flushes, and hands become clammy?CommentsTerry O\u0027NeillPresident, National Organization for WomenThe cause of equality for women is an important part of John F.

But there\u0027s a problem.Comments (29)Laurel MillerFood and travel writerMy bordering-on-obsessive hatred of \"foodie\" is really about the culture it\u0027s perpetuating. That said, the word itself is infantile, idiotic, and meaningless, and makes me want to poke my eyes out with a larding needle. Can\u0027t people just say they love food?CommentsNatalia Mehlman PetrzelaAssistant Professor of Education Studies and History, Eugene Lang College at The New SchoolFor all the genuinely positive energy that exists on Lulu\u0027s retail floors, an equally disturbing culture festers at the top and perpetuates a discourse with far more damaging implications than pilling capris.Comments (70)Chris Weigant, 2013.22.11Peter Dreier, 2013.22.11Tamar Abrams, 2013.22.11Marian Wright Edelman, 2013.22.11Diane Ravitch, 2013.22.11The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2013.22.11Brandon Turner, 2013.22.11Steve Rosenbaum, 2013.22.11Valarie Kaur, 2013.22.11Matthew Dietrich, 2013.22.11Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"ALTERNATE HISTORY What If JFK Had Lived?",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BizYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
