{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundFunding for gun violence prevention research at the CDC fell from an average of $2.5 million per year in 1993-1996 to half that in 1997-2000. Two decades later, the CDC is spending just $100,000 per year on gun violence prevention research. Meanwhile we are spending 2,500 times that amount on research to prevent traffic fatalities, even though traffic accidents and guns kill a similar number of people every year. We must not let this continue to happen. Our nation’s gun violence epidemic is not inevitable. Scholars must be allowed to do the desperately needed scientific research that will help parents, policymakers and the public determine how we can all work together to stop it. The NRA cannot be allowed to continue to block the truth at the cost of so many lives.Comments (158)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Why are today\u0027s Republicans so upset with an Act they designed and their patrons adore? Because it\u0027s the signature achievement of the Obama administration. There\u0027s a deep irony to all this.Comments (33)TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"Comments (163)Mia Farrow and Daniel Jonah GoldhagenThere was a time when Mr. Obama expressed outrage over the mass murder and aerial bombardment of civilians in the Darfur region of western Sudan. Now President Obama has joined that silence.Comments (104)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarSocial media-induced angst is happening with increasing frequency. Just as businesses and brands use social media to interact with their target audience and monitor consumer interest, people are using social media to gauge how their friends and acquaintances feel about them.Comments (15)John HudakFellow in the Center for Effective Public Management at the Brookings Institution, Managing Editor of the FixGov BlogKathleen Sebelius will stay, and Republicans have no one to blame but themselves. Why is this? In an ironic twist of fate the Republican Party\u0027s obsession with filibustering, delaying, or holding executive branch nominations will finally have negative consequences for the GOP instead of the president.Comments (189)Arianna HuffingtonIn the preamble of the Constitution, we are told that we are constantly moving toward a more perfect union. And while people in every age think they\u0027re living in a time of transition, ours truly is an age of transition when it comes to the rights of gay Americans.Comments (172)Aysha Akhtar, M.D., M.P.H.Neurologist, public health specialist, author \"Animals and Public Health. Why Treating Animals Better is Critical for Human Welfare\"The NFL continues to fund misleading head injury studies on animals that will not get the league closer to identifying the precise causes of brain trauma in football players and how to prevent and treat it.Comments (59)Lori LeibovichExecutive Lifestyle Editor, The Huffington PostMy family and I went dark for 24 hours from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday. I buried my iPad under a pile of books, stuck my iPhone in a drawer, and hid the TV remote from my kids.Comments (21)Julie BuntinDirector Of Programs, CLMPIn honor of that ghoulish and seasonally appropriate fact, here are 10 haunted house novels that will scare you more than the chained-up shed at the edge of your neighbor\u0027s property or that condemned mansion behind your elementary school.Comments (128)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorWith all these instances of Big Brother encroachment, one might want to opt out of the digital world entirely. Unfortunately, that is becoming more and more difficult in an increasingly technology-obsessed world.Comments (90)Robert CreamerPolitical Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersThe possibility of losing control of the House is beginning to stare GOP strategists in the face. Do they really want to risk incensing a big block of Hispanic and other immigrant voters by blocking immigration reform, and energizing them to go out to vote in large numbers to punish Republicans?Comments (177)Kate BartolottaOwner and founder, Be You Media GroupBeing introverted has nothing to do with lack of confidence. In some ways, I believe that the ability to enjoy being by yourself says a great deal about your confidence.Comments (302)Brett GallaherFounder, WeOccupyJesus.orgThis may come as a shock, but despite what your ex says about you, you\u0027re probably not going to Hell. Relieved? Good! But I hate to break it to you that your ex isn\u0027t going to Hell either.Comments (1,022)meQuilibriumPersonalized Stress ManagementDepending on how bad things have gotten, you may need a mini leave of absence to restore yourself. Recognize that you are capable of revitalizing and returning to your normal energetic self. But you do it by taking your foot off the gas, not pushing harder.CommentsCecile RichardsPresident of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, \u0026 Planned Parenthood VotesWhen it comes to Ken Cuccinelli, women in Virginia aren\u0027t buying what he\u0027s selling. Turns out the more Virginians learn about Cuccinelli\u0027s positions on women\u0027s health, the less likely they are to vote for him.Comments (274)Cheech MarinActor, comedian, activist and art collectorWhile much of the nation has insurance by Allstate, Farmers, or Blue Cross, the approximately 12 million undocumented immigrants in this country have only holy water and a prayer to protect them from financial disaster.Comments (35)Lyndsi FrandsenFounder and co-author of the blog, For All MomkindIt\u0027s our responsibility, as mothers, to do everything in our power to make sure we aren\u0027t (even unknowingly) raising mean girls.Comments (391)Maryann JacobsenRegistered dietitian, mom of two, freelance writer and co-author, Fearless Feeding How to Raise Healthy Eaters from High Chair to High SchoolAs parents, we all say things to encourage our kids to eat healthier. Yet, in our modern, food-centric environment, even well-intentioned comments can be translated into negatives that hinder eating.Comments (20)Carolyn GregoireFeatures Editor, Huffington Post Healthy LivingTrivializing and misusing a sacred tradition to sell luxury (not to mention sizeist) yoga clothing is not only embarrassing, it\u0027s offensive.Comments (227)Brie DyasIf my college-age neighbors are any indication, the next generation is an absolute mess.I\u0027m not even talking about \"life\" messes (finding a job, getting married, etc.) but physical messes. This is my grandmother\u0027s generation\u0027s nightmare.Comments (167)Trita ParsiPresident, National Iranian American CouncilAdelson\u0027s extreme comments are not innocuous, they carry great consequence. They carry political consequence given that Mr. Adelson is a major donor to many politicians, Middle East-focused think tanks and advocacy groups, and prominent Jewish organizations.Comments (57)ThrillistWe\u0027re a quick, free, daily e-mail ...Here are 15 ways to immediately get under your bartender\u0027s skin... things you should never do to the person who controls the trajectory of your life, err, night.Comments (34)Sen. Jay RockefellerU.S. Senator, West VirginiaThe U.S. was once a global leader in building and maintaining our infrastructure, but that\u0027s no longer the case. After decades of under-investment in our roads, airports and air traffic control systems, rails, and ports, we have fallen far behind -- and it\u0027s staring us in the face.Comments (13)Rabbi Shmuley BoteachRabbi and WriterWhether media commentators saw Sheldon as being serious or purposefully using exaggeration in order to make the larger point that the United States must go to extremes to ensure that Iran never gets a nuke.Comments (88)Mike RyanSenior Entertainment Writer, The Huffington PostMy point is that just because the script for Episode VII is being completely reworked doesn\u0027t mean we are in store for any kind of disaster. (To be fair: It doesn\u0027t mean we aren\u0027t either.) But it\u0027s that this kind of thing happens and it happened almost the same way 35 years ago.CommentsJason Vargo and Jonathan PatzCities in the U.S. have been struggling to \u0027pave their way out of congestion\u0027 for decades. It doesn\u0027t work.Comments (45)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistNothing inspires me more than a young girl who has strength, confidence and a healthy self-image. Which is why I\u0027m so proud of New York City for launching its new NYC Girls Project, a public awareness campaign designed to remind girls, ages 7 to 12, that self-esteem isn\u0027t built by slipping into a pair of designer jeans or cool shoes, but by celebrating who they are inside.CommentsJohn MarcotteWeb designer, writer and occasional political satiristMy girls have tiaras and gowns in their dress-up box right next to their capes and masks. They have a drawer full of Barbie dolls that live in peaceful coexistence with their action figures. But I think it is important for them to know that looking pretty is not the only option they have in life.Comments (50)Mark GodseyDirector, Ohio Innocence Project; Carmichael Professor of Law, University of Cincinnati College of LawHow could 10 witnesses have all said they were certain a defendant was the perpetrator of the crime, when DNA testing later proved that he was innocent?Comments (12)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027It\u0027s time to be honest about the deep-seated sense of race in the heart of our national politics.
