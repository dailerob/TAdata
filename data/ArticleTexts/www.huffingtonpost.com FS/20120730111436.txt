The two anti-the-other-guy strategies fit with a ton of negative advertising that\u0027s just begun but will reach mammoth proportions after Labor Day. Much of it will be financed by super PACs and by political fronts already taking in hundreds of millions of dollars in secret donations.

The public won\u0027t have endorsed any new ideas or bold plans, which means he won\u0027t have a clear mandate to do anything on the economy. The only thing the public will have decided is it fears and distrusts the other guy more. Which means the winner will also be burdened by almost half the electorate thinking he\u0027s a scoundrel or worse.Read Post | Comments (95)Martin Bashir, 07/29/12Journalist, Host on MSNBCAlthough Mitt Romney spent just a few short hours in the United Kingdom\u0027s capital city, he may well come to rue the day that he decided to accompany his wife Anne, and her horse, on their trip to the Olympics.Read Post | Comments (194)Mark Hyman, MD, 07/27/12Practicing physicianWhile we are wired to love food and derive great pleasure from the act of eating, somehow our love affair with food has become an abusive relationship.Read Post | CommentsMichael Roth, 07/29/12President, Wesleyan UniversityRomano does offer a series of often intelligent reflections on a diverse group of American writers.
