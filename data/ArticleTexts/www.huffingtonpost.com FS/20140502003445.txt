{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"John FefferCo-director, Foreign Policy In FocusWhen Barack Obama enters the geopolitical funhouse these days, the distorting mirrors reflect back very different images of the U.S. president. The mirror held up by the Republican party shows a presidential beanpole, a 98-pound weakling who is continually getting sand kicked into his face -- by Syria\u0027s Assad, North Korea\u0027s Kim, Cuba\u0027s Castro, and assorted other bullies. The administration\u0027s own mirror reveals a slightly bulked-up leader who professes to prefer diplomacy and is desperate to shift his attention to the Pacific. With a Nobel Peace Prize in one hand and an unmanned drone in the other, the president in this more flattering portrait is capable of following either Mars or Venus, depending on the situation. The funhouse mirror that Russia has constructed, however, is perhaps the oddest of them all.While both these men should be admonished for their remarks and their behavior, and while it\u0027s beautiful to watch society unite against the forces of evil, we cannot ignore the fact that racism happens everyday, and it\u0027s rarely acknowledged in mainstream media.Danielle CadetEditor, Black VoicesLast week, the World Economic Forum (WEF) released its annual flagship report on IT, the Global Information Technology Report (GITR). This year\u0027s report focuses on the risks and rewards of big data. An astounding number of technology transitions in the past 20 years have enabled millions of connections. The world wide web was just taking off in 1993.Tae YooSenior Vice President, Corporate Affairs, CiscoThere\u0027s no reason, in spite of the brutal nature of his crimes, that Lockett should have died in that practically medieval way. His penalty was death, not 24 minutes of what can only be defined as state-induced torture... and then eventual death. Torture wasn\u0027t part of the deal.Bob CescaManaging Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowWhen Sarah Palin commented, at this last week\u0027s national National Rifle Association convention, \"...waterboarding is how we baptize terrorists,\" she did worse than offend, worse than degrade human beings, worse than stir up a group of weapon-advocates. She did so in the Name of God.Rabbi Menachem CreditorEditor, \u0027Peace in Our Cities: Rabbis Against Gun Violence\u0027Anjali JoshiEducator. Learner. Sharer. Mother. Blogger at TheAdventuresOfaNewMom.com\u0027Well,\u0027 said my cousin Mark, \u0027what I\u0027m doing is what you programmed me to do.\u0027 In a voice half-resigned, half-loving, he addressed his parents, when he\u0027d reached age 24. On Mark\u0027s list was his bachelor\u0027s degree from a well-known college, his job in a Wall Street firm, his rent-stabilized apartment.Stanley ElyWriterWhile it may be disappointing, I have to confess to people who ask for my insights on the meaning of it all that astronomy doesn\u0027t provide any clearly useful data on matters of sin and souls. But it does offer some humbling insight into the scale of the problem.Seth ShostakSenior Astronomer, SETI InstituteThe first Thursday in May is a peculiar day for many Americans as it\u0027s a day set aside for government to intrude in their private religious practices. On May 1, the National Day of Prayer, government officials from city council to president ask citizens to join them in supplication.Roy SpeckhardtExecutive Director, American Humanist AssociationMore of my queer-identified friends use it than any other dating website because the options are varied -- just not varied enough. On the website, users can only identify as male or female, and as straight, gay, or bisexual.Alex BergAssociate producer and host, HuffPost LiveThe tides are turning on voter ID. Within the past week, a federal judge in Wisconsin and a state judge in Arkansas invalided their states\u0027 strict voter ID laws, and a Pennsylvania judge refused to reconsider his January decision striking down Pennsylvania\u0027s voter ID law.Joshua A. DouglasAssistant Professor of Law, University of Kentucky College of LawI\u0027m 28 weeks pregnant and like many moms-to-be, I\u0027m riddled with questions and mommy guilt. Am I doing this right? How will this affect the baby? Can I eat that? However, I\u0027ve noticed that my list of worries is also deeply rooted in holding onto my pre-pregnancy self.Julee WilsonStyle And Beauty EditorThe America that set me on my path would never deny the reality of a scientifically proven problem, or claim nothing can be done about it or that meeting the challenge will destroy the economy. By committing to seek solutions, we will reap benefits -- expected and unexpected. It\u0027s time to revive the American know-how and gung-ho enthusiasm that has long characterized this great nation.David SuzukiCo-founder, David Suzuki FoundationWhy do some people stagger under a mountain of credit card debt, paying high interest rates on their outstanding balances and never seeming to come out ahead, while others rarely if ever carry debt for long, despite pulling out their plastic on a regular basis?Amy TraubSenior Policy Analyst at DemosWhat\u0027s the advantage of paying Limbaugh the big bucks when host stations in New York and Los Angeles with barely-there ratings lose out to public radio stations at the far end of the dial? And when Limbaugh\u0027s advertising base has absolutely shriveled since his self-inflicted Fluke wound?Eric BoehlertSenior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaWhen it comes to sugar, cupcakes and cookies are obvious diet derailers. The real saboteurs of healthy eating however are sneaky sources of the sweet stuff, which in a day of meals and snacks can add up to serious trouble -- especially if you\u0027re among the 25.8 million Americans who suffer from diabetes.Elle PennerRegistered dietitian; Food and nutrition editor at MyFitnessPal, the world\u0027s leading nutrition and fitness app.As America\u0027s new economy starts to look more like the old economy of the Great Depression, the divide between rich and poor, those who have made it and those who never will, seems to grow ever starker. I know. I\u0027ve seen it firsthand.Peter Van BurenAuthor of \"Ghosts of Tom Joad: A Story of the #99Percent\" and \"We Meant Well\"While I\u0027m sure that people like the Dobsons are thrilled to have someone as influential as yourself to give them a platform for the hatred, bigotry, and lawlessness that they espouse, those of us who believe in true religious freedom find your venomous influence over so many of our fellow Americans to be quite disturbing.Chris RoddaSenior Research Director, Military Religious Freedom Foundation; Author, \u0027Liars For Jesus\u0027I arrive to find my mother in a state of high anxiety. My parents\u0027 home sold within weeks of listing it on the market and they are completely unprepared. My mother is intent on getting rid of everything she owns; if I\u0027d shown up any later, my parents might be sleeping on Tatami mats.Annabelle GurwitchAuthor, \u0027I See You Made an Effort: compliments, indignities and survival stories from the edge of 50\u0027It\u0027s time to end the United States\u0027 exceptionalism when it comes to incarcerating its citizens. A groundbreaking report released yesterday documents the unprecedented and costly price of U.S. incarceration rates.Ethan NadelmannExecutive Director, Drug Policy AllianceYoga feels good. But practicing yoga on a board in the middle of a bay or in the ocean is simply delightful.Sasha BronnerEditor, HuffPost Los AngelesAbout five years too late, federal prosecutors are talking tough about cracking down on crimes by big banks. But their boasting so far leaves out one important thing: people.Mark GongloffChief financial writer, The Huffington PostLike most people of my generation, I feel the need to be connected 24/7. But texting, social media and incessantly checking my email give me the opposite of what I\u0027m craving.Leigh WeingusTV Editor, HuffPost TVScience fiction both is, and always has been, a political genre. Of necessity, the politics of science fiction are reflective of the political climate in which it\u0027s written -- why else do we speculate about the future, but that we\u0027re concerned with the present?Foz MeadowsAuthor, blogger, bipedal mammal with delusions of immortality and carbon-based lifeform extraordinaire.Sometimes it\u0027s tricky explaining America to an 8-year-old. When our daughter was that age, the trick was explaining marriage. Now it\u0027s our son James who\u0027s turned 8. This time the America I find myself having to explain is the Boy Scouts of America.William Lucas WalkerWriter/producer; dadJohn is a rare breed of scholar-athlete one we can only hope will become far more common in future years -- and if John has any say, it will.Tim MorehouseOlympic Silver Medalist, Founder of Fencing in the Schools and TV correspondentYou opened your mouth and schooled my son on what it\u0027s like to be on the receiving end of ill-timed, inappropriate words. You helped me do what is one of my least favorite jobs as a parent: you thickened up his skin, made my sweet boy a little bit tougher.Jennifer BallMom, writer, teacher, lover of dirty martinis and dogs.With the controversy over the racist remarks of Cliven Bundy and Donald Sterling, one a rural cattle rancher in Nevada, the other an urbane California billionaire, we might want to reconsider just how \"post-racial\" America\u0027s race relations have really become.Joseph A. PalermoProfessor, historian, authorUnlike the rest of the world\u0027s democracies, the United States doesn\u0027t use the metric system, doesn\u0027t require employers to provide workers with paid vacations, hasn\u0027t abolished the death penalty and doesn\u0027t celebrate May Day as an official national holiday.Peter DreierE.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeWhile Sarah Palin may consider herself a patriot, all we need are more Americans publicly espousing waterboarding, and other unacceptable terror methods, to push even more potential enemies into believing that indeed the West is serving, or is itself, the Great Satan.Anne SpeckhardAuthor of Talking to Terrorists and Adjunct Associate Professor of Psychiatry, Georgetown University Medical SchoolSometimes it\u0027s tough to be a young multimillionaire CEO. Take it from RadiumOne ex-CEO, Gurbaksh \"G\" Chahal.Todd R. MillerCEO and founder, gwabbit.com. Author of \"Going Virtual\"He does not look like a man who has been through hell.
