{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AriannaCan we stop for a moment and reflect on the numbers coming out of Iraq? Since April 28, when the new Iraqi government was installed, 58 Americans and over 500 Iraqis have been killed (including 14 U.S. soldiers in the last three days). These numbers are real,and they reflect a tragic reality. Yet, as Harry Shearer points out, a big part of the daily news diet is made up of stories about things that have not yet happened -- and sometimes never do. Or things that may have happened but hardly deserve the media oxygen they consume (yes, Phil Spector, I’m talking about your hair!). But then, as Bill Maher reminds us in his blog it’s always easier to distract people than to try and deal with punishing realities going on 7,000 miles away.05.25.2005 Bill MaherI can see why administration supporters would want to deflect attention away from the gist of what I was saying, which was this: now that we can\u0027t meet our recruiting goals, maybe it\u0027s the people who were so gung ho for this war to begin with who should step up and go fight it. But of course it\u0027s always easier to distract people.read whole post | permalink05.25.2005 Lawrence O\u0027DonnellSenator McCain knew that he was risking his political future every minute he was in the room discussing compromise. What Senator McCain did in the end -- pushing both gangs of seven together for the press conference announcing what no one thought they could accomplish -- is easily the bravest political act of this century.read whole post | permalink05.25.2005 Erica JongNow that Laura Bush is back from the Middle East and can take off her black scarf, it\u0027s time to ask why she is promoting freedom for women in the Middle East when the rights of American women are being systemically eroded by her husband\u0027s initiatives. Is it the same reason why her husband promotes democracy abroad while the Patriot Act and the suspension of the Geneva Convention dilute democracy at home? Is wearing the headscarf the last refuge of a desperate housewife?read whole post | permalink05.25.2005 Paul FeigGlad to see the Ministry of Friendly Sounding Words was busy over the weekend finding Dr. Frist a new term for the much ballyhooed \"nuclear\" option -- the \"constitutional\" option. \"Constitutional\" is just a real pip of a word. Positively rolls off the tongue. In fact, it\u0027s downright fun to say. \"Con-stit-too-shun-al.\" It\u0027s the verbal equivalent of skipping down the street with an ice cream cone in your hand. It\u0027s like a semantic bag of Lays potato chips. You simply can\u0027t just say it once.read whole post | permalink05.24.2005 Arianna HuffingtonIt’s great that the Democrats staved off the nuclear option. But the reason the nuclear option was even a possibility in the first place is because they have ceded the foreign policy battlefront to a majority party that doesn’t represent the majority of this country on the crucial foreign policy issue of Iraq. Democrats need to realize that they will remain a minority party so long as they only dare to take on Bush and the Republicans on domestic issues.read whole post | permalink05.25.2005 Paul KrassnerIn 1950, when my first girlfriend told me that she had dated a Negro, I blurted out, \"Did you kiss him on the lips?\" I was even more stunned than she was. Just hearing myself say that was a shocking wake-up calI. It would be necessary to unbrainwash myself from all the nuances of bigotry that I had so thoroughly and unconsciously absorbed by cultural osmosis.read whole post | permalink05.24.2005 Norm OrnsteinLike his brother Matthew, who moved to Hollywood after graduating three years ago, my son Danny feels as if he has been on an intense treadmill since -- well, since pre-school. Every moment, in his view, was programmed -- afterschool activities, soccer and baseball, religious school, summers, high school extracurriculars, and so on. Now the programming has come to a complete halt, and he both needs a breather, and a game plan to figure out what to do when the next day, week and month are all filled with electives.read whole post | permalink05.24.2005 Harry ShearerMembers of the journo trade, used to seeing advance texts of speeches not yet delivered and polls about behavior not yet engaged in, barely stifle giggles at the bare-chested predictions delivered each week on the McLaghlin shoutfest, yet a big part of the daily news diet is made up of stories about things that haven\u0027t yet happened, and sometimes, as on Tuesday, never do.read whole post | permalink05.24.2005 Catherine CrierA new survey just released this week reveals that over the last ten years, the number of colleges and universities with foundations exceeding one billion dollars has jumped from 17 to 47. Given the state of education in this country, with our primary and high school students falling far behind students in other developed nations, might these esteemed halls of higher learning help support the farm teams to better prepare future collegians for their institutions?read whole post | permalink05.25.2005 Neal BaerAmerica faces many challenges today: terrorism; AIDS, stem cell research; cloning; and the economic challenges of globalization. What makes these issues even more difficult is how to address them in a growing climate of fear and close-mindedness. I believe telling stories for social change is one way each of us can make a difference.read whole post | permalink05.24.2005 Marc CooperSome have called the soaring deaths the “unintended consequences” of U.S. border policy. It might be better called a national shame. The number of people who have died trying to cross the U.S. border since 1995 is now more than ten times greater than the total number who died trying to cross the Berlin Wall.read whole post | permalink05.24.2005 Christopher HitchensI still feel an affectionate interest in a young scribe at whose bar-mitzvah I danced. And I still, always, sue anyone who accuses me of bigotry or Holocaust-denial. Young master Blumenthal can relax: his attempted association was too lax and too cowardly. Anyone thinking of running with it, however, can check my website and view the correspondence with the lawyers of the last person who tried this: Mr Henry Kissinger.read whole post | permalink05.24.2005 Seth GreenlandLike President Clinton, Bill Maher is lucky in his enemies. Rep. Spencer Bachus (R. Ala.) has accused him of treason for pointing out in a colorful way (I loved the low-lying fruitpicking metaphor) that the armed forces are not meeting their recruiting goals. The frothing-at-the-mouth behavior of people like Rep. Bob Barr only made Clinton seem statemanlike in contrast. Similiarly, the fulminations of Spencer Bachus nudge Maher in the direction of Will Rogers.read whole post | permalink05.24.2005 Sean DanielThe best interests of the Republic, the power of filmed entertainment and the ability of the Democrats to fight a better battle in the future all came together Monday evening in Washington DC. Sen. John McCain, under pressure to get to the premiere of his bio-pic Faith of My Fathers seems to have used his need to get to the screening on time to knock heads and get \"the gang of 14\" to hammer out their compromise.read whole post | permalink05.24.2005 Bruce FerberClick here to watch the video, \"The Misadventures of Lil Arnie, Part One\"read whole post | permalink","h1":"Maher Blogs Bachus -- A HuffPost Exclusive",".title":"","h2":"On The Blog NowFruitThe Bravest Political Act of the CenturyLaura Bush, Desperate HousewifeTest Marketing a New Term ...Next Dem Battlefront: IraqConfessions of a RacistGraduationFake-OutsA Goldmine for EducationTell Us Your StoriesBeyond the Borders of HypocrisyOn Slander, Innuendo, and Bar-Mitzvah DancesMaher v.
