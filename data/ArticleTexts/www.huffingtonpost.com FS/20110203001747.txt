Marc Ginsberg, 02.01.2011Former US Ambassador to MoroccoAs the Brotherhood thrusts itself into a central role in any post-Mubarak transitional coalition, the Brotherhood\u0027s rabid ideological brand of Islam is raising the specter of an Egypt potentially slipping into the hands of Islamic extremists.Read Post | CommentsRobert Reich, 02.02.2011Fmr.
