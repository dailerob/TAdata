{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Dear Colleagues, I know it looks just terrible for us right now. Our caucus is badly split, we are getting killed in the polls, we have had to drop the demand to defund Obamacare, all the corporate leadership is mad at us for playing roulette with the debt, and there are even some likely primary challenges from mainstream business Republicans to our Tea Party incumbents. But fear not. We may lose a battle, but we will win this war. Why? Barack Obama will save us. He always does. He is effective on the campaign trail but as a legislative negotiator we can usually count on him to snatch defeat out of the jaws of victory. The irony is that all Obama had to do was resist our demands for more budget concessions and we would have had to fold.Comments (459)Deborah CaldwellReligion and politics writerIf the U.S. breaches its debt ceiling this week, leaders of a little-known far-right movement called Christian Reconstructionism can claim partial responsibility.Comments (988)Jeff MadrickRoosevelt Institute Senior Fellow; author, \u0027Age of Greed\u0027It\u0027s very important that President Obama and his aides make clear to the American public that the Republican Party\u0027s right wing, supported by moderates, offered no serious deal to him by proposing a postponement of their threat to let the U.S. default.CommentsAdam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; founder of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911Many Americans may be asking themselves: Why should I care about the debt ceiling, or the -- barring Congressional action -- coming default? Put simply, unlike corporate tax cuts, a debt ceiling default will have a trickle-down effect that will affect your wallet in one way or another.CommentsBianca JaggerFounder and Chair, Bianca Jagger Human Rights FoundationThe Ecuadorian communities were the victims of exploitation by a multinational corporation, Texaco. Their lives, and that of their children, are affected by the toxic waters that leaked into water sources on which they are dependent. With their legal team on trial, who will pursue justice for the Ecuadorian plaintiffs now?CommentsSteven FulopMayor, Jersey CityRepublican opposition to the ACA has made the fights about Social Security and Medicare look like a walk in the park. What is almost criminal is how opponents of the law are essentially denying Americans their now constitutionally-guaranteed rights.Comments (333)Bruce AckermanProfessor of law and political science, Yale; Author \u0027The Decline and Fall of the American Republic\u0027Though Congressman Peter King is from New York, he should not be mistaken for an old-fashioned moderate Republican. He is a full-blooded Reaganite, but he is realistic enough to recognize that his party is engaged in a suicide mission.Comments (251)Eric IdleEnglish comedian, Monty PythonCurrently you appear to be almost in a state of civil war. If one party can shut down the government, then the social compact to rule is broken. In most other democracies this simply could not happen.CommentsStephanie MeadeFounder, Editor-in-Chief of InCultureParent.comStereotypes run rampant in much of our media consumption and children\u0027s cartoons are no exception. Our children, no matter what their race or background, don\u0027t see enough cartoons with diverse characters in different cultural settings.Comments (51)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Keeping the government running and paying the nation\u0027s bills should never have been bargaining chits in the first place, and the President and Democrats shouldn\u0027t begin to negotiate over future budgets until they\u0027re taken off the table.Comments (714)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027The reason that many people might be sympathetic to shutting down the govPolls consistently show that people grossly overestimate the amount of money going to many less popular categories of spending. This is where the New York Times comes into the picture.CommentsWait But Whywww.waitbutwhy.comA Facebook status is annoying if it primarily serves the author and does nothing positive for anyone reading it.Comments (431)Mansur GidfarCommunications Director, Represent.UsWhile there\u0027s certainly plenty of finger pointing to go around, few of them have been pointed in the right direction. This isn\u0027t President Obama\u0027s shutdown or John Boehner\u0027s shutdown -- it\u0027s Citizens United\u0027s.Comments (180)Lyz LenzWriterI have a princess -- a little magical ballerina-butterfly-tutu-fairy-princess. It\u0027s not what I chose, it\u0027s what she chose. And when faced with this responsibility, I believe it\u0027s not my job to teach princess abstinence; rather it\u0027s my job to teach my daughter how to use princesses wisely.Comments (204)Joe PeyronninHofstra Journalism ProfessorOnly in Washington would the very people who caused the government shutdown, and possibly a catastrophic government default, demonstrate against the shutdown. Confused? Well there is no better practitioner of perception deception than Senator Ted Cruz.Comments (124)Katie HopkinsBroadcaster and business womanIf you have fed your child into obesity - you are failing your child. If you think not talking about it will make it go away - you are wrong. You need to get your head out of the sand and your kid\u0027s head out of the food cupboard.Comments (315)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorLike the 777 point decline when House Republicans rejected the TARP, only to pass it a few days later, that may be what it takes to end this charade.Comments (24)Whitney RichelleAmerican journalist living in Florence, ItalyItalian food culture is probably very different from what you\u0027re used to at home. And since Italians have been perfecting it for over 1,000 years, try going with the wine and olive oil flow instead of fighting against the current when you\u0027re in Italy.CommentsSteven StraussAdjunct Lecturer in Public Policy, Harvard Kennedy SchoolResidents of the 10 American states with highest support for the Norquist Pledge have shorter life expectancies than those in the 10 states with least support for the Pledge. So it seems appropriate to ask -- is the Norquist small government philosophy bad for your health?Comments (64)Dr. Judson BrewerAssistant Professor of Psychiatry, Yale School of MedicineWe might wonder how it came to be that we started meeting psychiatric diagnostic criteria for addiction, not for heroin or alcohol, but for a social media site. It can\u0027t possibly be the \"like\" function that makes us irritable and anxious when we can\u0027t check our feed. So to what, exactly, are we addicted?Comments (44)Eric KasumFounder of the Imagine Institute, a think tank for PeaceWhy do we honor a man who, if he were alive today, would almost certainly be sitting on Death Row awaiting execution?Comments (616)Michelle Langbehn30-year-old cancer patient, mother, wife, activistI\u0027m furious that Congress has chosen to shut down the government and leave so many of us behind. This is not just about the debt ceiling or national parks. For me, the shutdown means that Congress is denying me potentially life-saving treatment.CommentsKatie D. AndersonAuthor of the young adult novel KISS \u0026 MAKE UP and regular contributor at parade.com on raising teenagersWake up, people. This needless incessant phone-to-phone contact is ruining relationships and not just romantic ones. Bottom line: Our children need a break.CommentsMax BlumenthalJournalist and authorWhile the prime minister ranted against Iran in New York, his government was preparing to implement the Prawer Plan, a blueprint for the expulsion of 40,000 indigenous Bedouin citizens of Israel from their ancestral Negev Desert communities.Comments (71)Stanislas KralandEditor, HuffPost C\u0027est la VieWhen I wake up in the morning, I don\u0027t hurl myself on my iPhone -- which also serves as my alarm clock -- to check my emails, as I was doing systematically. I\u0027ve also put a stop to this unnecessary consultation of my inbox between home and the entrance to the nearest subway station.CommentsEmma BrodieWriterI hit an invisible wall and the music came to an abrupt halt. Off clattered the headphones of youthful naiveté (previously unnoticed by me). I wasn\u0027t in a story at all, I was in the East Village and that smell was pee.Comments (32)Paul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostThe themes and speakers at VVS2013 have the whiff of decayed ideas and diminished power. But the really horrible part of the event is the complete and utter lack of interest in the poor, the immigrants, and those on the margins -- you know, those people Jesus loved.Comments (748)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundExtremist Republicans continue to hold funding for the federal government hostage for the second week in a row, opposing a clean extension of government funding without conditions. Their actions are harming the economy and countless real children and families across the country.Comments (406)Jeff DanzigerPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideComments (151)Katie HalperCo-founder, Laughing LiberallyWell played, James Woods. You have cast yourself as a martyr -- and the president and liberals as villains responsible for your stalled career.Comments (174)Dr. Michael J. BreusClinical Psychologist; Board Certified Sleep SpecialistNew research shows that a midday nap may play a crucial role in enhancing memory and boosting learning capabilities in preschool-age children.Comments (17)Mike Ragogna, 2013.14.10Daniel O\u0027Donnell, 2013.14.10Eric Idle, 2013.14.10David Kudler, 2013.14.10Noah Tsika, 2013.14.10Sharon Stapel, 2013.14.10Lisa Earle McLeod, 2013.14.10Chris Weigant, 2013.14.10MaryEllen Tribby, 2013.14.10Bianca Jagger, 2013.14.10Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"\u0027TREMENDOUS PROGRESS\u0027 Reid, McConnell Near A Deal...
