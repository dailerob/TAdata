{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"APAPAPFrom youtube.comThe Lamont/Lieberman race and the lack of unanimity among Democratic leaders in endorsing and defending their own Party\u0027s candidate dominated the HuffPost blog this week. Don\u0027t miss Bob Geiger\u0027s Lamont-support tote board, along with takes from Taylor Marsh, David Sirota, RJ Eskow, Pachacutec, Joe Palermo, Eric Alterman, Dave Johnson, Cenk Uygur, James Boyce, Byron Williams, Bennett Kelley and me. For everything else -- Iraq, Israel/Hezbollah, the judge\u0027s ruling on Bush\u0027s domestic spying, etc., etc. -- check out our Sunday roundup below. Oh, and for non-stop coverage of JonBenet, just turn on the television. And if you want to read about just how pathetic this obsessive TV coverage is, check out Rachel Sklar and Jeff Cohen.READ POST | comments08.18.2006 Harry ShearerIf the centerpiece of the push for a democratic Middle East is to be consigned to \"alternatives other than democracy,\" that would seem to be big news.READ POST | comments (34)08.16.2006 James PinkertonIn Rick Warren\u0027s vision, Christian missionaries will be the new recruits to the anti-AIDS Army.

John MurthaThose who speak of ending the war in Lebanon are seen as skillful diplomats. Yet those who dare speak about ending the war in Iraq are labeled by Bush\u0027s henchmen as unpatriotic defeatists.READ POST | comments (111)08.17.2006 Mark GreenWhen Bush said \"I am the decider\" in response to a question about Rumsfeld and Iraq, he was betraying his true view of the democratic conversation.READ POST | comments (70)08.16.2006 Joe ScarboroughNow, instead of laughing at Democrats\u0027 ill-directed arrogance, Republicans are quietly joining the left in questioning the President\u0027s intellectual prowess.READ POST | comments (328)08.13.2006 Stephen ElliottBecause peace requires compromise on both sides. If you demonize an entire population, ie: Arabs only understand force. Israelis are opportunists. then you are not looking for a solution.READ POST | comments (29)08.14.2006 Amy EphronWhy isn\u0027t there any regulation on the trackability of pre-paid cell-phones? We know they can be used for networks of people to speak to each other without anybody being able to track them.READ POST | comments (36)08.18.2006 Hooman MajdTom Friedman admits that he hasn\u0027t decided yet who\u0027s the winner in the war between Hezbollah and Israel (how much time do you need, Tom?), but he\u0027s certain who the loser is: Iran\u0027s taxpayers.READ POST | comments (80)08.15.2006 Tom McCarthyAs we drew closer to the destruction, walking down the middle of the street over coin-sized pieces of glass, I had a grisly realization. \"Smells like Ground Zero.\"READ POST | comments (133)08.15.2006 Arianna HuffingtonSo the best Bill Clinton can do is state the painfully obvious: that voting for Ned Lamont is not a vote for terrorists?READ POST | comments (126)Michael SmerconishJames MooreLarry BeinhartJeralyn MerrittColeen RowleyShayana KadidalEric BoehlertSuzanne NosselFrom abcnews.comAPAPFrom nmm.ac.ukFrom wikipedia.orgFrom garnderlinn.com/ourworld.cs.comLogin to Huffington Post  |  Make Huff Post your Home Page  |  RSS/XML  |  Sitemap  |  JobsCopyright 2006 © HuffingtonPost.com, LLC   |  User Agreement  |  Privacy  |  Comment Policy  |  Powered by MovableType","h1":"",".title":"","h2":"Official: Blair Thinks Bush Has “Let Him Down”...Sunday RoundupHOW TO END THE WAR IN IRAQKim Jong Il on Cinema: Another Book ReportWhy Little George and his Manly Men Like to Refer to the \"Bad Guys\" as \"Folks\"Consider the MindsetTerror Alerts Causing General Racist ReactionBuried Lede Department--Goodbye, DemocracyThe Coming AIDS ReformationMe and My Goody BagThe Dichotomy of Two WarsLosing our Democracy to the \"New Authoritarians\"Is Bush an Idiot?My Middle East VacationTake a Thousand and Call Each Other in the MorningThe Neo-ColonialistBlogging from Beirut: Scene of DestructionThe Clinton Doctrine and Why There is No Third Way In ConnecticutProfiling: Street Smarts by Any Other NameKarl CalledSay it Loud, Say it Often, \"Republicans are Bad on National Security\"UK Considers Racial Profiling, U.S. Moves to Psychological ProfilingKeep Fear and Politics Out of Effort to Combat TerrorismNSA Program Ruled Illegal, UnconstitutionalThe Lapdog Press Rolls Over, AgainYou Say You Got A Resolution: What\u0027s Next For Lebanon?","h3":"-Tom Hayden-Merrill Markoe-Thomas de Zengotita-Jayne Lyn Stahl-Dave JohnsonBlogsColumnistsFull BlogrollArianna Online ArchiveNews Sources",".snippet":"","h4":"Jon Kerry: Lieberman Is “Adopting The Rhetoric Of Dick Cheney”…Sen.
