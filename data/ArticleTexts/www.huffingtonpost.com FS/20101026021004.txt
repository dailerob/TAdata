{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"I\u0027m delighted to announce the launch of our newest section, HuffPost Health -- a one-stop shop for the latest news and opinion on what we can do to live healthier lives. Our approach to matters of sickness and health has changed radically over the past few decades. We no longer approach our health as a passive experience, one where we sit back, allow ourselves to be poked, prodded, examined, receive the verdict, and compliantly go along with whatever the High Priests of Medicine say. We\u0027ve become partners in our medical care. Because of this, making sure we have the latest information and the fullest understanding of ourselves and our health is vital. HuffPost Health\u0027s goal is to inform, enlighten, challenge, inspire, and help you make educated decisions about your health and well-being.Read Post | CommentsDr. Dean Ornish, 10.25.2010Medical Editor, The Huffington Post, Founder and President of Preventive Medicine Research InstituteHuffPost Health is a place for serious and interesting conversation and education around all aspects of personal health and well-being, including treatment, prevention and wellness.Read Post | CommentsDr. Winfried Wilcke, 10.24.2010IBM ResearchThe real electric car revolution won\u0027t happen until we solve questions about range, how to recharge them and make cars that everyone can afford.Read Post | CommentsRobert Reich, 10.25.2010Former Secretary of Labor; Professor at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Aftershock: The Next Economy and America\u0027s Future\u0027Why are Democratic presidents so much more easily intimidated by the \"move to the center\" rhetoric after midterm losses than Republican presidents?Read Post | CommentsLincoln Mitchell, 10.25.2010Harriman Institute, Columbia UniversityFocusing on the effect the Tea Party will have on the Republican Party on Nov. 2 and beyond misses the point because it falsely suggests that the Tea Party and the Republican Party are different entities.Read Post | CommentsDaphne Eviatar, 10.25.2010Senior Associate in Human Rights First’s Law and Security ProgramThis morning I sat in a U.S. military commissions courtroom in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and watched the first child soldier charged by a Western nation since World War II plead guilty to crimes he was never seriously accused of.Read Post | CommentsLivia McRee, 10.25.2010Animal rights and education activistWorking as a wildlife rehabilitator has many ups and downs. The sadness of watching animals suffer can be overwhelming and often seems pointless. But occasionally there are bright spots that put everything into perspective.Read Post | CommentsGarry South, 10.25.2010Principal, The Garry South GroupHas the mainstream media gone flaccid in vetting candidates, particularly first-time candidates with no public record? There is perhaps no better example than the basically free ride Carly Fiorina has been given.Read Post | CommentsMark Osler, 10.25.2010Professor of Law, University of St. ThomasI am straight, and though everyone gets made fun of for something, I never faced the relentless teasing, bullying and violence that gay and lesbian kids did and do. In fact, I was a bigot. But I got better.Read Post | CommentsJohann Hari, 10.25.2010Columnist for the London IndependentObama, or any other president, is unable to approach a problem by asking: How do I fix this? Instead he asks: How can we get corporations to consent to a small cosmetic gesture that will, for a while, appease public anxiety and anger?Read Post | CommentsJosh Silver, 10.25.2010President, Free PressWhen media conglomerates such as The Washington Post Company control too much, their own interests -- and opinions -- directly conflict with the public\u0027s desperate need for sound policy and diverse, independent, critical viewpoints.Read Post | CommentsAlon Ben-Meir, 10.25.2010Senior Fellow at NYU\u0027s Center for Global AffairsThe geopolitical benefits of a durable Israel-Syria peace are numerous, and the opportunity at this moment is ripe. Whether Netanyahu recognizes these benefits will be a significant test of his leadership.Read Post | CommentsEvelyn Robert de Rothschild, 10.25.2010FinancierThe speed with which information now flows into our homes cannot be underestimated. Where once we made decisions, now it seems we merely react to information. Are we missing the chance to understand what is actually going on?Read Post | CommentsAlice O\u0027Connor, 10.25.2010Professor of History, University of California, Santa BarbaraThe myth of the mancession may not take us back to the dark days of cultural denial, but its exaggerated claims echo the old stereotype-laden, zero-sum ways of thinking that pit the fortunes of female earners against those of men.Read Post | CommentsRobert Greenwald, 10.25.2010Filmmaker, Brave New FilmsThe use of private contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan makes a few people very, very rich, but it\u0027s making the rest of us -- Americans and local civilians alike -- much less safe.Read Post | CommentsSimon Jenkins, 10.25.2010Writer for the Guardian and the London Sunday TimesThe idea that the American invasion liberated Iraqis from kidnap, torture, rape and summary execution is shown to be a sick untruth in the Wikileaks documents. Indeed a shocking feature of the leaks is that few Iraqis appeared surprised.Read Post | CommentsWilliam K. Black and L. Randall Wray, 10.24.2010The \"too big to fail\" doctrine has always been unproven, dangerous, and counter to the law. An institution that is not permitted to fail or be resolved by the government faces obvious adverse incentive problems.Read Post | CommentsTenzin Dickyi, 10.25.2010Special Assistant to the Dalai Lama’s Representative to the AmericasChinese leaders should for once listen to the voice of the Tibetan people, and yes the voice of conscience, and at least allow the Tibetans this small zone of linguisticRead Post | CommentsJoseph McNamara, 10.25.2010Research Fellow, Hoover Institution; Fmr. Chief of Police, San Jose, CaliforniaOver my career, I have seen firsthand how misguided our marijuana policies are for our state and our country.Read Post | CommentsLen Levitt, 10.25.2010Veteran police reporter and authorIn a town where a cop can\u0027t accept a free cup of coffee, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly has been eating and drinking for free for the past eight years at the Harvard Club.Read Post | CommentsJalen Rose, 10.25.2010ESPN/ABC studio analystThe voting gap among young people who vote and those who do not is not a function of apathy. It is a function of lack of sufficient civic education in our schools, in our media, and in our society.Read Post | CommentsSen. Tom Carper, 10.25.2010U.S. Senator from DelawareIf you think cyber crime and cyber terrorism aren\u0027t real, let alone scary, think again. Eventually, I hope Americans focus on this critical issue every day, not just one month out of the year.Read Post | CommentsRobert Kuttner, 10.24.2010Co-founder and co-editor of The American ProspectIf we want to put Social Security in the black forever, the best way to do it is to put Americans back to work and raise their wages, since Social Security is financed by payroll taxes.Read Post | CommentsGeorge Heymont, 10.25.2010San Francisco-based arts criticThree independent full-length animation features have such strong storytelling techniques, such brilliant artwork, and such quirky appeal that they should not be overlooked.Read Post | CommentsAlec Baldwin, 10.24.2010ActorThe Harry Reid vs. Sharron Angle race typifies what is dividing Americans this election year.

I must admit I never thought I would ever be condoning roots, but it all goes to show, \"Never say never.\"Read Post | CommentsClancy Sigal, 10.25.2010AuthorWhen did we on the left forget how to fight back in dark alleys and call our enemies what they are: degenerate psychopaths who wear women\u0027s corsets, have smelly feet and hermaphroditic tendencies?Read Post | CommentsTavis Smiley, 2010.10.25Lily Bevan, 2010.10.25Baruch Shemtov, 2010.10.25Don Kraus, 2010.10.25Sam Isaac Edwards, 2010.10.25Peter M.
