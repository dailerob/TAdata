{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AriannaAs is our longstanding tradition (two weeks in a row now), on Sundays we bring you a review of some of the most interesting posts from the past week -- in this case a week that on our Blog ran the gamut from questions about whether Darth Vader is Bush, and whether the female orgasm has an evolutionary purpose to questions about whether the spread of anti-Americanism around the globe is due to Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib or to the fact-checking department at Newsweek. So read our roundup and don’t forget to check out the latest on The Blog and on The Newswire.05.17.2005 Norman MailerI\u0027m beginning to see why one would want to write a blog. At present, I have a few thoughts I can certainly not prove, but the gaffe over the Michael Isikoff story in Newsweek concerning the Koran and the toilet is redolent with bad odor. Who, indeed, was Isikoff\u0027s supposedly reliable Pentagon source? One\u0027s counter-espionage hackles rise. If you want to discredit a Dan Rather or a Newsweek crew, just feed them false information from a hitherto reliable source. You learn that in Intelligence 101A.permalink05.17.2005 Robert F. Kennedy Jr.For 15 years King Coal and Big Oil, led by the Exxon Corporation, have funded dozens of Washington think tanks stocked with aberrant scientists (known as biostitutes) to persuade the public and the press that the science is still out on global warming and give political cover to the industries’ indentured servants on Capitol Hill -- corporate toadies like James Inhofe and Tom DeLay.permalink05.22.2005 Arianna HuffingtonThere I was, as is my Sunday morning tradition, watching Meet the Press while doing yoga. (Or is it doing yoga while watching Meet the Press? Whatever.) Tim Russert was interviewing Howard Dean. At least, I’m pretty sure it was Russert. For one thing, I was in the Uttanasana II position, so I couldn’t see very well. For another, what I was hearing sounded remarkably like some White House flack...read whole post | permalink05.18.2005 Al FrankenThe Coalition Provisional Authority, which we ran, has lost 8.8 billion dollars. By lost, I mean it’s totally unaccounted for. Not only has Congress not \"looked into\" this $8.8 billion and who might have it now, but it seems that some members are completely unaware that this staggering sum, which was supposed to go toward rebuilding Iraq, is missing. The Sunday morning after the White House Correspondents dinner, I ran into Senator George Allen at a brunch thrown by John McLaughlin and his wife. Allen had never heard of the missing $8.8 billion, or at least that\u0027s what he told me. And he\u0027s on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.permalink05.21.2005 Thomasin FrankenAt the school I teach at in the Bronx, one student who had never been to school before shouted on the first day of kindergarten, \"Stop reading so loud, Teacher! I am trying to sleep!\"read whole post | permalink05.19.2005 Larry GelbartNewt Gingrich and President Hillary Rodham Clinton Gingrich.Announce the Arrival ofHarmony, and her twin sister, Amnesia,Born at St, John Paul, the 2nd HospitalFebruary 25th, 2009, in the dead of night.permalink05.21.2005 Simon JenkinsA year ago I walked in the market square in Fallujah. I have done some crazy things in my time but I would not walk down any street in Baghdad today. Please, America, realize that in Iraq you have not created another Vietnam or Beirut or Somalia. You have created something far, far worse and getting more so.read whole post | permalink05.17.2005 Danielle CrittendenA French woman spends an entire year eating nothing but fois gras, drinking red wine and smoking three packs of filterless Gauloises a day, and finds that not only does she remain thin, but that her life expectancy increases over that of her American counterpart.permalink05.18.2005 Harry ShearerYou may have read about this a couple of weeks ago--a tape, from a source, aired on my radio program, in which Sean Hannity coaches two nurses about to be guests on his Fox TV program about how to respond to the questions of his \"liberal\" counterpart, Alan Colmes. In any case, now here\u0027s the video of that sequence, with the added bonus of some fine Hannitized leg-crossing.permalink05.17.2005 Catherine CrierA purely political maneuver by the Republican majority, this is nevertheless an affront to one hundred eighty years of Senate practice. All of us who care about precedent, about established rules of engagement, should voice objection to this clear attempt to move the goal post when it’s your turn to kick.permalink05.19.2005 Nathan GardelsThe US has discovered that by acting in Iraq without the legitimacy conferred by consent of global public opinion, the political objectives for which our military might was deployed, and for which we are draining our treasury, cannot be met.permalink05.16.2005 Irshad ManjiWhy riot violently over the mistreatment of a Quran? It\u0027s not as if one\u0027s basic human rights have been transgressed.permalink05.19.2005 Jim LampleySome of the most revered players in baseball, beloved for their hustle and commitment, were juiced to the teeth on greenies every time they wore the uniform. It was one way of conquering a persistent hangover -- and in a world where some of the people were drunk half the time, and half the people were drunk all the time, that was a daily priority for players, managers and executives as well.read whole post | permalink05.19.2005 Laurie DavidI immediately replaced all of our toilet paper and tissues with post-consumer recycled materials. I did this quietly and anonymously -- just as an experiment. I wanted to see who in my family would complain first. It didn\u0027t take long for my ten year old daughter to register her objections.permalink05.19.2005 Jerry and Joe LongSatellite photos indicate North Korea may be preparing to detonate a nuclear bomb. Apparently they show a giant hole having been dug then refilled, and what may be some sort of reviewing stand. Here\u0027s the question...even if it\u0027s \u0027Helmet Night\u0027, why would anyone want to be in the grandstands for a nuclear test?read whole post | permalink05.18.2005 Christie HefnerLet’s ask why the Koran story was credible in the first place. Might it have something to do with the accurately reported (in words and pictures) horrible actions that took place at Abu Ghraib, and allegedly at Guantanamo Bay?permalink05.17.2005 Paul RieckhoffCheck this out from Sgt. Greg Papadatos, of the \"Fighting 69th\" Infantry Regiment. He and his guys are using Radio Controlled toy cars to detonate IEDs in Iraq.permalink05.17.2005 Rep. John ConyersWe asked some questions. The White House ignored them. We asked them again. Still no word. So we asked them again. We still haven\u0027t heard back from the White House press office. We plan to keep asking until we do.permalink05.17.2005 Greg GutfeldGERGEN WORD SCRAMBLE! - Unscramble the names of pundits who don’t hold a candle to David Gergen: -Beleck Bob -elenora fticl -Trom Kondracke -David Cornpermalink05.19.2005 Richard BradleyTim Noah has an interesting suggestion about the Times\u0027 plan to charge $50 for online access to its columnists: What happens when certain columnists drive much more traffic than others? Will columnists\u0027 salaries now rise or fall in proportion to how many paying readers click on their columns? And will columnists start changing their subject matter in order to attract those lucrative hits?

And conservatives pooh-poohed my concern. But now Laura Bush has backed me up.read whole post | permalink","h1":"",".title":"","h2":"On The Blog NowIntelligence 101AFacts are Stubborn ThingsTim Russert Ties Me Up in KnotsWhat in God’s Name is Going On?Plea from a Third Grade TeacherA Very Special AnnouncementIraq: Inside the Green ZoneAnd I Thought ‘Star Wars’ Was About Missile Defense…Found Object: We Coach, You DecideThe Results Are With Us For LifeThe Rise and Fall of American Soft PowerThe Riots in JalalabadThe Truth About SteroidsComfort vs Conscience -- The Bathroom Battle Has Begun!Pathetic vs ObsceneWho\u0027s Sorry Now?Radio Shack WarriorsStill Crazy After All These YearsJUST FOR KIDS!The New York Times Gets Greedy, AgainLaura Bush Backs Me Up....But Misses the Point About America\u0027s Image Problem","h3":"",".snippet":"","h4":"Laura Bush Heckled at Islamic Holy ShrineAnd Ariel Sharon Heckled in New YorkBeatty Takes on Schwarzenegger: \u0027We Are Not the Governor\u0027s Dumbbells\u0027Fear of Civil War Grows as Shia Start to RetaliateBlack Market Organ Trade Is Baghdad\u0027s New Growth IndustryChirac Counts on Jungle Tribes to Swing EU VoteMedia Often Ignore Women as Sources, New Study FindsPsychiatrists May Push for Gay Marriage OKDarwin\u0027s Theory Evolves into Culture WarSenators Aim to Avert Filibuster ShowdownLaser Could Rival Energy From Sun\u0027s CenterConservationists Claim The Gap \u0027Encourages Children to Kill Butterflies\u0027What the Nanny Saw: D.C.\u0027s Fanciest Cribs, And the Babies Inside","h5":"","h6":"Huff Post Updates:","tr":"APR MAY JUN 23 2004 2005 2006 31,359 captures 22 Apr 05 - 2 Sep 16 Close HelpAPR MAY JUN 23 2004 2005 2006APR MAY JUN232004 2005 200631,359 captures 22 Apr 05 - 2 Sep 16Laura Bush Heckled at Islamic Holy Shrine in brief | comments And Ariel Sharon Heckled in New York in brief | comments Huff Post Updates: Beatty Takes on Schwarzenegger: \u0027We Are Not the Governor\u0027s Dumbbells\u0027 in brief | comments Fear of Civil War Grows as Shia Start to Retaliate in brief | comments Black Market Organ Trade Is Baghdad\u0027s New Growth Industry in brief | comments Chirac Counts on Jungle Tribes to Swing EU Vote in brief | comments Contact the Huffington Post with scoops, and firsthand accounts at: AOL Instant Messenger: HuffPost.
