{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"I\u0027m delighted to announce the launch of our latest local section, HuffPost DC. When we look at Washington -- really look at it, beyond the grand city of popular imagination -- we see a city of incredible contrasts. On one side is the glitz of official Washington -- the D.C. of formal state dinners and big money fundraisers. On the other side is a city with close to 11 percent unemployment -- a number that more than doubles in neighborhoods east of the Anacostia River. A city experiencing the dislocation of African Americans in historically black neighborhoods. Often lost in the swirl of D.C. politics are communities that grapple daily with poverty and the lasting effects of discrimination and segregation, paying the price for D.C.\u0027s distorted public image that omits huge numbers of the city\u0027s residents, with sometimes tragic consequences. At its heart, Washington, D.C. offers a tale of two cities. And it is this tale that animates our new section.Read Post | Comments (43)Bob Cesca, 9/15/11Producer, Editor of BobCesca.comThe cable news media has gone from simply cracking gaming and sports metaphors to actually becoming a game, with politicians as the contestants and a rotating guest panel of snickering propagandists and \"analysts\" as the judges.Read Post | Comments (36)Joe Montana, 09.15.2011Retired NFL Quarterback; Domestic Hunger ActivistOne out of every 6 Americans doesn\u0027t know where their next meal is going to come from. It is unconscionable that anyone should be facing food insecurity in this land of plenty, which is why all of us should do our part to ensure no one has to go hungry again.Read Post | Comments (3)Sen. Blanche Lincoln, 9/15/11Former U.S. Senator (D-Ak)The sooner we remove incendiary politics from our nation\u0027s rulemaking process, the sooner we can restore the health of our economy -- and our political culture.Read Post | CommentsJason Linkins, 9/14/11Editor, Eat the PressThe game has definitely changed. After many months of essentially succumbing to being a passive participant in the GOP\u0027s debt ceiling negotiations, the Obama administration has obviously decided that this \"pivot to jobs\" was going to occur with fervor and urgency.Read Post | Comments (2,340)Dan Rather, 9/15/11Host, \u0027Dan Rather Reports\u0027In talking to military leaders -- both Coalition and Afghan -- I sensed an unmistakable optimism that the Afghans would be able to stand up so that the Americans can go home at the end of 2014.Read Post | Comments (15)Tony Newman, 9/15/11Director of Media Relations, Drug Policy AllianceI have mixed feelings when I hear about Palin and other politicians\u0027 drug use. The revelations are beneficial by helping shatter the myth that if you try drugs you are going to be an unproductive person who ruins your life. But the hypocrisy is infuriating.Read Post | Comments (166)Devon Corneal, 9/15/11LawyerSomeone told me that once I had my son, I\u0027d forever be afraid that something bad would happen to him.

Daylin Leach, 9/15/11State senator from Pennsylvania\u0027s 17th DistrictElections in a democracy are sacred. Changing the rules created by our founders in order to benefit one political party is profoundly wrong.

Palermo, 9/15/11Associate Professor of American History, California State University, SacramentoThe political wizards around Obama do not understand how demoralizing the Obama presidency has been for his most enthusiastic supporters.

Spitzer, 9/15/11Distinguished Service Professor, Political Science, SUNY CortlandImagine a very different Constitution -- one where Congress could kill any state law, where a twenty-six member Senate controlled treaty-making with other nations, and where the president\u0027s veto was exercised jointly with the Supreme Court.Read Post | Comments (41)Bill Richardson, 9/15/11Former U.S. Energy Secretary, Governor of New Mexico and UN AmbassadorIn the midst of this year\u0027s \"Arab Spring,\" approximately 149 countries formalized the creation of the International Renewable Energy Agency called IRENA, a relatively new entity designed to accelerate renewable energy adoption.Read Post | Comments (19)Robert Scheer, 9/15/11Editor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027It\u0027s getting too late to give President Barack Obama a pass on the economy.
