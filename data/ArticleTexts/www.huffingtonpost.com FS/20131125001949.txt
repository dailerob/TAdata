{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThat explosion you heard this week was Harry Reid going nuclear, as the Senate voted 52-48 to eliminate the ability to use filibusters to block most Judicial and Executive branch nominees. Republican Senators hysterically decried the move as \"a raw power grab,\" \"Obamacare II\" and \"scary and dictatorial.\" In fact, it was Republican senators who forced the issue by filibustering nominees at an unprecedented rate, including -- for the first time ever -- a cabinet nominee. Half the nearly 170 filibusters of presidential nominees in U.S. history have happened since Obama -- who was accused of \"packing\" the DC district court simply for trying to fill vacancies -- took office. It\u0027s still unlikely any real solutions will come out of our gridlocked congress, but at least now the Senate can\u0027t make our other two branches of government just as unproductive. Ka-boom!Comments (108)Jamal AbdiPolicy Director, National Iranian American CouncilWith the deal that was signed in the early morning hours in Geneva on Sunday, the two sides managed to change course from the path to a disastrous war and put us on a road that ends with concrete assurance that Iran will never obtain nuclear weapons. Though it is just an interim agreement, after thirty years of non-relations, the deal is historic.Comments (23)Matt WalshBlogger, talk radio host, father of twinsThat\u0027s our entire economic system: buy things. Everybody buy. It doesn\u0027t matter what you buy. Just buy. How appropriate, then, that a holiday created by our ancestors as an occasion to give thanks for what they had, now morphs into a frenzied consumerist ritual where we descend upon shopping malls to accumulate more things we don\u0027t need.Comments (938)Gary HartPresident, Hart International, Ltd.For those of us powerfully motivated toward public service by the Kennedy challenge to our idealism, one not heard since then, we choose to believe that he had the potential to become that rare political leader beyond politics, certainly beyond partisanship.Comments (56)Kerry KennedyPresident, Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human RightsI\u0027ve been asked again and again how I will be marking this anniversary. When it comes to my Uncle Jack, my father, or any other loved ones we\u0027ve lost, I believe in honoring lives, not deaths.Comments (33)Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoIt is a shame that the Republicans brought things to this pass. The filibuster is a useful tool to prevent a president whose party controls the Senate from pushing through the nomination of an appointee who is incompetent, who lacks integrity or whose views are truly outside the \"mainstream\" of respectable opinion. That we have now lost that important safeguard is deeply unfortunate.Comments (762)Edward Jay EpsteinAuthor, \u0027The Annals of Unsolved Crime\u0027The possibility that Lee Harvey Oswald had assistance can never be precluded. But the real question is not how but why Oswald assassinated the president. His death ended the hope of unraveling his motive.Comments (282)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundI hope, as we remember a young President, that we will renew our commitment to building with urgency and persistence a just America where every child is valued and enabled to achieve their God given potential regardless of the lottery of birth.Comments (131)Jamie Lee CurtisActress and children\u0027s book authorThat is the Kennedy I like to think of when everyone asks, \"Where were you when you heard JFK was shot.\" I was at my own birthday party with balloons and a Barbie cake with five glowing candles and presents and games and an understanding that something enormous had shifted in the universe and my happy birthday would never be truly happy again.Comments (84)Mike LoveLead singer, The Beach BoysAfter completing this song, it must have been 2 a.m. in the morning when we finally called it a night. We were awakened to the news that President Kennedy had been taken to Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas. For a bunch of carefree guys in our early twenties, our innocence was lost.Comments (60)Linda TiradoNight Cook, Essayist, ActivistWe know that the very act of being poor guarantees that we will never not be poor. It doesn\u0027t give us much reason to improve ourselves.Comments (6,272)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027The church writ large in the United States and the Western Church more broadly continues to struggle with a history of underrepresenting women and people of color in leadership. These kinds of things don\u0027t change overnight.Comments (33)Diane RavitchHistorian, NYU professorI met John Kennedy twice. He came to meet with the political science majors in 1958, and we spent an hour or so talking about the issues facing the nation. He was charming, handsome, funny, well-informed.CommentsRussell SimmonsFounder, GlobalGrind.comI thought I knew where most Democrats stood. I thought they stood on the side of the poor, the elderly, the disenfranchised, and all of those struggling to stay afloat during some very difficult economic times. But, then came a website.Comments (424)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistI\u0027ve always been a champion of kids pursuing their dreams. But sometimes in life, extraordinary circumstances may force us to temporarily put our dreams on hold. The most important thing is to never lose sight of that dream, no matter what punches life may throw in our way.CommentsMatt Damon and Gary WhiteWater plays a central role in all aspects of life, from energy to food security, health and education. That is what makes it so complex to tackle. As water scarcity becomes all too real, collaboration will become essentialComments (43)Cecile RichardsPresident of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, \u0026 Planned Parenthood VotesAccess to reproductive health care should never depend on your zip code -- and from statehouses to courthouses to the ballot box, we are going to continue the fight to make sure it doesn\u0027t.Comments (66)Gavin NewsomLieutenant Governor of CaliforniaGovernment needs technology to meet the needs of its citizens, but it also needs the help of the industry to make good decisions that do not push us further behind.CommentsDr. Jill BidenSecond Lady of the United StatesThrough the power of mentoring, TechWomen brings together female scientists, technologists, engineers, and mathematicians who can work to resolve our world\u0027s most pressing issues, making the world we share a better place, one woman at a time.Comments (19)Bernard-Henri LévyFrench philosopher and writerLet\u0027s pray for taxation. Without it we would have no way to protect the most vulnerable among us, to assist the most needy, and, most important of all, to enshrine in law the principle of responsibility for others.Comments (105)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarFilms are getting more violent -- more than twice as violent as they were in 1950. That\u0027s perhaps no surprise. But new evidence has revealed that the most violent films are actually the ones aimed right at kids.Comments (47)Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOCEOs and other leaders, in the corporate world and beyond, should do more than follow the news on the Affordable Care Act (ACA or Obamacare). They should also ask themselves what they would do if they were in President Obama\u0027a shoes.Comments (73)Jeffrey SachsDirector, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \"To Move the World: JFK\u0027s Quest for Peace\"Many progressives will no doubt say that I\u0027m being unfair to the Keynesians, and that they too would favor an investment strategy if the Republicans didn\u0027t block them. I hope that\u0027s true. Yet Keynesian stimulus repeatedly takes our eyes off the long term.Comments (136)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkIs it okay to highlight website problems? Yes. Is it okay to push the president to get these tech issues resolved quickly? Absolutely. But when did having website problems become the same thing as not sending enough help to those dying and suffering in the midst of a devastating hurricane?Comments (112)Cherie BlairFounder, Cherie Blair Foundation for WomenThe Middle East is a key region of interest because although increasing numbers of women are receiving a good standard of education, the region still lags behind on the core issue of economic equality. On a global scale, the latest figures from the World Economic Forum\u0027s Global Gender Gap Report show that although the gender gap in education is 93% closed, the gap in economic equality has closed by only 60%.Comments (21)George Stevens, Jr.Award-winning writer, director, producer and founder of the American Film InstituteWe made Years of Lightning, Day of Drums so the world might see and remember what we knew in those days. And now the larger reward is that the film survives so this and future generations may hear the soaring voice and view the vibrant likeness of the man who offered such singular inspiration half a century ago.Comments (33)Susan BoyleI love the concept of \u0027Pay It Forward\u0027. The idea that you can pass on an opportunity and a good deed to someone deserving or help someone in life fulfil a dream is a wonderful concept, embraced not only in the USA but over 100 countries around the world and I strongly believe that we should make it more prevalent in the UK. With life getting busier, more hectic and stressful for all of us it\u0027s easy to forget acts of kindness and helping others, even the smallest good deeds can make the biggest of differences.CommentsPaul RieckhoffFounder, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of AmericaSenate gridlock and dysfunction has reared its ugly head again -- and this time it\u0027s survivors of military sexual assault who will pay the price.Comments (20)Mark ShriverSenior Vice President for Strategic Initiatives, Save the ChildrenToday marks the 50th anniversary of President Kennedy\u0027s death, yet just 10 days ago, Jeanne and I were celebrating with my cousin Caroline Kennedy as she was sworn in as Ambassador to Japan.CommentsCaryn James, 2013.24.11Seth Moulton, 2013.24.11Anthony Figliola, 2013.24.11Marcel Hidalgo, 2013.24.11John Zipperer, 2013.24.11Lydia Dobyns, 2013.24.11John O\u0027Kane, 2013.24.11Dominique Browning, 2013.24.11Marjoriet T.
