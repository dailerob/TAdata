{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Assoc. Professor, Univ. of Missouri, Kansas City; Sr. regulator during S\u0026L debacleCharles Murray\u0027s newest book, Coming Apart: The State of White America, proves two classic truths. First, it is impossible to compete with self-parody. Second, be careful what you ask for; for you may receive it. Charles Murray asked right-wing plutocrats to drop what he derided as \"political correctness\" and denounce Americans who received governmental support as immoral failures. Murray is a vigorous supporter and flatterer of Mitt Romney, claiming that the fact that he became wealthy at Bain should make him a \"slam dunk\" for the presidency. Murray\u0027s reasoning is so crude that he announces a new doctrine -- the divine right of CEOs to govern America. But be careful what you wish for, Romney and Paul Ryan answered Murray\u0027s call of right wing plutocrats to arms.Read Post | Comments (686)Barbra Streisand, 09/18/12Singer; Actress; Director; Composer; ActivistDo we want to go backward with Mitt Romney or move forward with President Obama?
