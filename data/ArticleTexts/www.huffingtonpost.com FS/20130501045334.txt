{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Howard FinemanEditorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupToday, celebrity is driving digital and social media, in society and in journalism. Will it unite us for the common good and for the good of commerce? Or will it divide, distract and dumb us down in an atavistic search for the attention that begets \"traffic\" that begets advertising that begets profits that beget power? These are new forms of old questions. Iron and steel not only made the railroads, but also the mass newspaper presses of the ugly tabloid wars. Television brought us Ed Murrow but also, well, television. What\u0027s new now is that journalists have become their own distribution systems, which means that they have a reason -- or an excuse -- to be in the celebrity business, for the supposed sake of their work. In confident, knowledgeable hands, this can be a very good thing.Comments (54)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistThere\u0027s an old saying that sex is one of three topics of conversation that shouldn\u0027t be brought up at the dinner table (the other two being politics and religion). And that\u0027s the fun thing about having a website: it\u0027s not the dinner table!Comments (171)John T. ChambersChairman and Chief Executive Officer, CiscoDebuted today by First Lady Michelle Obama, the White House IT Training program -- in partnership with Joining Forces and the President\u0027s Military Credentialing and Licensing Task Force -- will help transitioning military personnel make the difficult shift to the civilian workforce by providing the necessary training for high-demand IT jobs.Comments (11)Jamie Lee CurtisActress and children\u0027s book authorYesterday Jason Collins changed the world forever when he told the truth. Yesterday Jason Collins told the NBA, the players and fans that he was a gay man. It is the moment of truth that the world has been waiting for.Comments (210)Arianna HuffingtonBecoming Fearless is part of our larger effort to put the spotlight on what is working in our culture rather than just on what\u0027s dysfunctional. Taken individually, these stories inspire. Taken together, they testify to something larger -- that in the face of multiple crises, people are responding with strength, courage and resilience.CommentsPaul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostCollins\u0027 experience refutes the polarity we hear so much of, that to be religious is to be anti-gay or to be gay is to be anti-religious.Comments (813)Lea GroverWriter and toddler-wranglerI know you didn\u0027t expect most of this. I know you didn\u0027t anticipate loving somebody so intensely, or loathing your post-baby body so much, or being so tired, or being the mom you\u0027ve turned out to be.Comments (36)Julia CameronAuthorOnce upon a time I was a fearless traveler. But fear of flight soon crept into my life and settled in like an unwanted houseguest. What happened? I had never had any real flying scares, nothing more than a bumpy landing here and there.Comments (42)Dan TreadwayAssociate blog editor, The Huffington PostI don\u0027t blame Chris Broussard for saying what anyone familiar with his past opinions on the gay community knew he\u0027d say. I blame ESPN for missing out on the Collins story, then burying it until they could think of a way to make this news about them.Comments (20)Robert ScheerEditor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027Dictators, mired in more technologically primitive societies, didn\u0027t develop the fearsome new implements of control of the National Security State. Google and other leaders in this field of massively mined and shared information did.Comments (83)Eduardo GaleanoAuthor, \u0027Children of the Days: A Calendar of Human History\u0027The history of literature is an unceasing paradox. What is the most popular scene in the Bible? Adam and Eve biting the apple. It\u0027s not there. Plato never wrote his most famous line: \"Only the dead have seen the end of war.\"CommentsKathleen MilesAssociate Editor, HuffPost Los AngelesWhichever owner wins out, change is coming, and LA readers and journalists need to be paying attention. The LA Times largely decides what is LA news.Comments (1,105)Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkThis is undoubtedly a breakthrough moment in athletics, and another step towards fairness and tolerance in the African-American community. As a civil rights leader who has advocated on behalf of LGBT rights, I can unequivocally say that this is a tremendous moment of encouragement.Comments (64)Tricia ToddDirector/Producer, \u0027Killing the Messenger\u0027If no story is worth a life, then why is murder the number one cause of journalists\u0027 deaths worldwide? In addition to those who have been killed, dozens have been attacked, kidnapped, or forced into exile in connection with their coverage of crime and corruption.CommentsRichard Allen SmithAfghanistan War VeteranTim Brando, you are now Archie Bunker. You are a man living outside of your time. You don\u0027t believe these things because you are a white, male, Christian, over 50 or have a family. You believe these things because you are wrong.Comments (131)John BlumenthalFormer Playboy editor/Novelist/Screenwriter(\u0027Blue Streak\u0027)My daughters are grown up now -- both of them in their mid-twenties, both well-adjusted and successful -- but I remember receiving a lot of unsolicited (and mostly misguided) advice and criticism from childless people regarding the way my wife and I were raising them.Comments (365)Elizabeth DrewJournalistThe nonsense about what it takes for a president to win a victory in Congress has reached ridiculous dimensions. The fact that Barack Obama failed to win legislation to place further curbs on the purchase of guns has made people who ought to know better decide that he\u0027s not an \"arm-twister.Comments (507)Carole Brody FleetSpeaker and Award-Winning Author, \"Happily Even After…\" and \"Widows Wear Stilettos…\"The only thing that a wonderful first date should lead to is a second date...not breakfast in bed the following morning.Comments (895)Adrian KulpBlogger \u0026 Author, \"Dad Or Alive\"Every day, I suit up for battle. It\u0027s not just the usual twice-a-day stuff like \"I don\u0027t wanna go\" or \"I don\u0027t wanna eat that for breakfast.\" I\u0027m talking about something every hour. Screaming, pushing, punching, biting, spitting, back-talking, karate kicks and testicle head butts. All in a day\u0027s work.Comments (102)Ted Danson and Andrew SharplessIn the ocean you find a symphony of sound, from the clicking of snapping shrimp to the long mournful wails of whales, and zips of dolphins. Now imagine this oceanic soundscape shattered by dynamite-like blasts, every 10 seconds for days and even weeks on end.Comments (73)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; host, \u0027The Breakdown\u0027; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureYou know me, don\u0027t you? That\u0027s right. I belong to that tiny and soon-to-be vanishing breed known as Sequester Delay Passengers.CommentsAndy OstroyPolitical \u0026 pop culture analystOnce we get past the hoopla and the effusive praise for the pioneering 34-year-old currently with the Washington Wizards, the real question remains: what does his historic coming-out mean for him, the NBA, pro sports and society as a whole?Comments (20)Debra MacleodRelationship expert and couples’ mediatorAh, springtime -- the skies are blue and love is in the air. Every year around this time, my Inbox fills with questions from those looking for love. In response, here\u0027s a short list of dating tips that you may want to tape to your fridge if you\u0027re a single-and-seeking.CommentsHope KronmanStudent22 is the age of in-betweens -- in between adolescence and adulthood, in between relationships, in between this job and that career -- and it\u0027s nearly impossible to know who you are when you are still \"becoming.\"Comments (16)William K. BlackAssoc. Professor, Univ. of Missouri, Kansas City; Sr. regulator during S\u0026L debacleAs firms are forced by \"free trade\" to force lower wages on their workers if they wish to stay competitive with their competitors who manufacture goods in nations like Bangladesh, and as firms in Bangladesh engage in the same competition to constrain wages, the result can be murderous.Comments (17)Apne AapA grassroots movement to end sex traffickingIn the red light area, children\u0027s access to mainstream education, health and protection services are often blocked due to stigma.CommentsHarvey KarpPediatrician. Creator of the DVD\u0027s/books \u0027The Happiest Baby on the Block,\u0027 \u0027The Happiest Toddler on the Block\u0027 and \u0027The Happiest Baby Guide To Great Sleep\u0027Three key tools help mothers today shield their little ones from harm. Two are extremely simple: clean water and nutritious food. But the third is one of the most complex and brilliant creations of science: immunizations.CommentsCarrie GoldmanAuthor, BULLIED: What Every Parent, Teacher, and Kid Needs to Know About Ending the Cycle of FearThere is a little-told secret among those of us who adopt or have trouble building a family -- we feel as if we should be grateful for every minute every second of every hour for our children, as if we never have the right to feel overwhelmed by the tasks of parenting.Comments (350)Blake KernenA 7th grader from Morristown-Beard School, New JerseyHer name is Rosie Napravnik. That\u0027s right, I said \"her.\" Rosie is one of only a few successful female jockeys in history -- and she\u0027s the only female to be running for the roses this year.CommentsStu KreismanAuthor and Emmy Award-winning Writer and ProducerLook, I know Texas and California don\u0027t get along. To the Gomerts, Perrys and Cruzes and the people who voted for them we will always be the Hollywood, pot smoking, satanic, porn loving lefties. However, all I met were people that would fit right in here on the left coast.Comments (43)Sally OsbergCEO, Skoll FoundationComments (14)Mike HoganExecutive Arts and Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post Media GroupNobody\u0027s quite sure who Jon Snow is serving, but Ygritte intends to find out, wasting no time executing the nudity clause in actress Rose Leslie\u0027s contract. I loved the part where she asks him, \"Why are you still dressed?\" Ygritte, have you been watching this show?Comments (268)Sasha Alexander, 2013. 1.05Mike Ragogna, 2013. 1.05Liat Kornowski, 2013.30.04Linda Bergthold, 2013.30.04Caroline Dowd-Higgins, 2013.30.04J.W.
