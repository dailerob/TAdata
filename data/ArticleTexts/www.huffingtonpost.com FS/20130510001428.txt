{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna Huffington\"I have experienced failure as a politician,\" Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe once said. In his second round as the country\u0027s prime minister, he is determined to avoid the mistakes of the past -- beginning with how to deal with the stagnant Japanese economy. I asked Abe about this when I met with him on Thursday afternoon in his office in Tokyo. \"My policies do not conform with the conventional wisdom,\" he said. \"However we have been suffering from a long period of deflation and at the end of last year we faced a serious unemployment crisis. I am convinced that my economic policies are the only path to break out of this crisis.\" For now, while the U.S. and Europe sputter along, restrained by the politics of austerity, Japan under Shinzo Abe is set on a bold course to revive a moribund economy.Comments (326)Bob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowThe Benghazi attacks (the consulate and the CIA compound) are absolutely not unprecedented even though they\u0027re being treated that way by Republicans.

The investigations and accusations and conspiracy theories are entirely motivated by politics.Comments (812)Kathy MulvanySenior Director, Cisco Corporate AffairsHere in the United States, we lack enough trained people to fill the information technology (IT) jobs that are vital to every industry.

GoodmanExecutive Business Editor, The Huffington PostWe already know that our banks remain too big to fail, threatening regular people with crisis. Now, a parallel reality is emerging in the garment trade: Most of our clothing is produced by global enterprises so vast and complex that they are simply too big to supervise.Comments (270)Derek ShearerProfessor of Diplomacy at Occidental College and former US ambassadorIt\u0027s important for Obama to try to move the political debate in a more progressive direction. In this way, even when he can\u0027t pass legislation he can tee up issues for action in the Clinton administration that might follow.Comments (16)Valerie JarrettSenior Advisor and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsAs the girls described the atrocities they had suffered -- in many cases, for years -- my blood boiled. How on earth could this happen time and time again, right here in our community? How could the internet be used so blatantly as a tool to sell our children into slavery?CommentsShelley EmlingEditor, Post 50In 2012, everyone seemed to have \u0027a bucket list\u0027 or issue \u0027a spoiler alert\u0027 or argue that something or other \u0027isn\u0027t rocket science.\u0027 Unfortunately there are more overused terms to replace them in 2013. And, as always, they tend to drive me up the wall.Comments (732)Joseph A.

But I hope the Air Force does a better job remedying this problem than it\u0027s done preventing sexual assaults.Comments (195)Jeffrey SachsDirector, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \u0027The Price of Civilization\u0027In recent weeks, citizens in many countries have been learning more about one of the biggest and most dangerous scams in the world: the global web of tax havens that U.S. and European politicians and bankers have nurtured over the years. The situation is absurd, dangerous and out of control.Comments (248)Steven J. SimmonsChairman of a US telecommunications company; Fmr. White House aide to previous administrationsIn my baby boomer lifetime, I have watched well intentioned presidents and their advisors repeatedly lead the country into wars that kill and maim our young people, drain our economic resources, do not advance our national security, and in retrospect should never have been fought.Comments (12)Chez PazienzaCo-host, \u0027The Bubble Genius Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027; writer, Deus Ex MalcontentFor a long time now I\u0027ve been saying this and, thanks to Sanford, I feel like I\u0027m getting a very nice little shot of pure validation at the moment: scandals don\u0027t last anymore.Comments (213)Megan GriffoWriter, HuffPost Weird News and CrimeMy friend from high school disappeared a month ago, and now I see this 22-year-old woman\u0027s life condensed in a missing person poster.

And that\u0027s no accident. Here\u0027s why.CommentsAndrea NeusnerWriter, mother of 3 girls, and a former customer at Abercrombie and FitchNot only will I not let my kids shop at Abercrombie again, I will not let them wear what they already have in their closets. Normally I donate our unwanted clothes, but in this case, I wouldn\u0027t want any unsuspecting thin, cool person to send the message that being exclusionary is OK.Comments (37)Christine Gross-LohAuthor, Parenting Without Borders: Surprising Lessons Parents Around the World Can Teach UsThough parents around the world have the same goals, American parents like me (despite our very best intentions) have gotten it all backwards.Comments (294)Terry O\u0027NeillPresident, National Organization for WomenIs \"military justice\" for women an oxymoron?

There\u0027s not enough jazz, they say. There was no 3-D in the 1920s! It\u0027s two movies that don\u0027t fit together! Has Jay-Z even read the book?! If you\u0027re a fan of F. Scott Fitzgerald\u0027s book, take a deep breath. It\u0027s not as bad as they make it seem.Comments (138)William AstoreWriter, Professor, Retired Lt. Colonel, Air ForceYou can hardly point out that the Emperor has no clothes if you\u0027re not even allowed to look in his direction. And that\u0027s precisely the point of the government\u0027s war on whistleblowers. The message couldn\u0027t be more clear or more authoritarian: Avert your eyes, citizens!Comments (38)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesAll of us who were in the trenches of the AIDS war are today dealing with the grief and the survivor guilt.
