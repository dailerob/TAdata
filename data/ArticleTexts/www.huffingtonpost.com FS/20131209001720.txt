{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week brought the passing of Nelson Mandela. He was a man whose towering authority derived from his relentless devotion to humanity at its most basic level. While locked away for 27 years, the rage of injustice was supplanted by a willingness to build bridges to those who\u0027d imprisoned him. After his release in 1990, his first goal was reconciliation, not retribution. \"The whites are our fellow South Africans,\" he said the next morning. \"We want them to feel safe.\" And after becoming the first democratically elected black president of South Africa, that unremitting dedication to what\u0027s best in us continued. \"He no longer belongs to us,\" said President Obama upon learning of his death, \"he belongs to the ages.\" But let\u0027s not relegate him to the ages just yet -- we desperately need his spirit of transcendence and compassion right now. As he wrote in 1995: \"It always seems impossible until it\u0027s done.\" Rest in Peace, Madiba.Comments (18)Muhammad AliBoxing LegendMandela. One name. One man.

We choose to provide access to treatment to everyone in the world living with HIV by the end of this decade, not because it is easy, but because it is hard. This is our moon shot.Comments (47)Kumi NaidooExecutive Director, Greenpeace InternationalThe world has lost a true leader, a true father and a true inspiration.
