{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Chief Executive Officer, The King CenterThe slaying of Michael Brown has cast a tragic pall over race relations in America, and the faces of his heart-broken parents provide the emblematic image of the summer of 2014. It should have been otherwise. As the investigation into the facts of this horrifying incident proceeds, we are left with the painful, inescapable realization that our justice system has brutally failed once again, for there can be no justification whatsoever for the police slaying of an unarmed young man. The preliminary forensic evidence adds further outrage to the public reaction, and we are left to wonder how a travesty of justice of this magnitude could occur in the 21st century. Have we learned nothing from numerous incidents of police overreaction resulting in tragedy in recent years?Apparently U.S. history began when Barack Obama was inaugurated. In case you were unaware, he is evidently the first president to take vacations; he\u0027s the first president to play golf; he\u0027s the first president to be photographed without a suit or tie; and he\u0027s the first president to routinely use a teleprompter.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027The latest reports from Europe indicate that the continent is slipping back into recession. The U.S. is doing only slightly better, with positive economic growth but scant progress on the jobs front, and no growth in the earnings of the vast majority of Americans.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027We\u0027ve got to decide do we want freedom, justice and power with a clear vision on how to get to those places, or if we only want to vent and spit, until the next Michael Brown is killed.Public speaker and activist; author, \u0027Barack Obama, Ronald Reagan, and the Ghost of Dr. King: Blogs and Essays\u0027The flood of commentary with regards to ISIS, as usual, reveals little in the way of rigorous logic. Also as usual, tactics eclipse strategy. Serious governments, especially that of a super power, should not conduct their foreign relations in a state of histrionics.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghWhile debate swirls about a racially biased justice system and evidence leaks predominate in the news media, another issue deserves scrutiny: the extensive legal hurdles prosecutors must clear in cases like this.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityThe media stories have been legion, the words expended many. And yet, as attention shifts elsewhere (even though the children continue to arrive), the real factors that would have made sense of what\u0027s been happening remain essentially untouched and largely unmentioned. It couldn\u0027t be stranger -- or sadder.Professor of History and Coordinator of Latin American Studies at Salem State UniversityWhy should we boycott Burger King just because they are avoiding their US tax responsibilities? Because if they don\u0027t pay their fair share of US taxes, someone else has to, and that someone is you.Bestselling author and professor of finance at SP Jain whose new 2014 book is entitled \u0027Why Diets Fail: Because You’re Addicted to Sugar\u0027The UN Security Council dramatically escalated the conflict with al Qaeda splinter groups by passing UN Resolution 2170. This UN Security Council is the latest in a series of draconian UN Resolutions against terror groups pursuant to its responsibility of forgotten obligations.Visiting Fellow, Brookings Doha CenterThe public should recognize that the battle over the course of Fed policy is hugely important to the well-being of tens of millions of families. It should also recognize that the folks willing to deny these people jobs and wage increases will not feel constrained by the truth in pushing their agenda.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Our democracy can\u0027t function properly if corporations may spy and snoop on nonprofits with impunity. This espionage is a despicable means of degrading the effectiveness of nonprofit watchdogs and activists.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorIn 1978, a passionate 14-year-old boy did what ARPANET experts thought was impossible.Director of High Performance and Research Computing Division, Rutgers Medical SchoolBy this point in the summer, a sane person could reasonably conclude that the world is going nuts. Spiraling out of control, descending into darkness, making optimism a delusional last recourse -- that kind of feeling.USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorWhat are called a \"public schools\" in many of America\u0027s wealthy communities aren\u0027t really \"public\" at all. In effect, they\u0027re private schools, whose tuition is hidden away in the purchase price of upscale homes there, and in the corresponding property taxes.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027What is needed is exactly what the Kerner Commission recommended to the country 46 years ago: a comprehensive shift in the priorities of our social spending away from the military-industrial-prison complex and toward widespread development of impoverished parts of America.Professor, historian, authorNot long ago, Malcolm Gladwell made a bold prediction: Fifty years from now, Apple will be around and Microsoft will be gone, but Bill Gates will be remembered -- and Steve Jobs won\u0027t. As surprising as it seems, Gladwell might be right.Wharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027Will Congress act to save taxpayers billions of dollars -- and protect the solvency of the Medicare programs -- by taking on the AMA, the drugmakers and the insurers? Don\u0027t hold your breath.Author, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgDepression can be treated if a person does not die by their own hands before they get better. That\u0027s possible when someone feels able to take off the mask that conceals their pain and their illness, and turn to others to seek life-saving help.Medical director, New York State Office of Mental HealthPhysicians need to ask patients if they lock away their guns for the same reason they ask patients whether their children are constrained while sitting in the car.Mike the Gun GuyThis is the year in which we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Civil Rights Bill. Instead of being able to reflect on the distance we have traveled since 1964, the horrific events unfolding in Ferguson, Missouri only served to remind us of how far we still have to go.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027The 1960s demand for \"first class citizenship\" echoes through the years as our call to justice today. Unfortunately the Bull Connor images of peaceful protesters were not historic remnants but eerily prescient of tanks and tear gas last week in Ferguson, MO.Chair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusMaybe the pain of death -- of all the deaths this summer -- will finally remind us what it means to live.Associate Editor, HuffPost ReligionWhatever one thinks of the President\u0027s actions so far, it does not seem likely that there will be a majority in Congress in the near future to force the withdrawal of U.S. military forces. But there might well be a majority in the near future to insist that a military campaign that goes on for months needs explicit Congressional authorization.Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicyDeep down in the depths of my soul, I knew that his purpose in life is being fulfilled. This isn\u0027t a fact that is easily accepted. My soul knows something that my earthly body continually fights.Author of Isaiah\u0027s Story - A memoir chronicling the traumatic loss of Jennifer\u0027s son.Companies need to recognize that there is a bit of Ferguson in many of their management ranks, boardrooms, and stores that needs to be eradicated for the well being of their businesses and the people they serve.National Diversity Expert; Principal and Chief Strategist of Criticality Management Consulting; Former Associate Dean of Harvard CollegeIt\u0027s hard enough carving out a space for ourselves in a world that constantly marginalizes us and our very existence. And having strange men assume that we want to hear what they think of us when there are very few things we want less in the world just adds to the burden.Columnist and author of \u0027Open: Love, Sex, and Life in an Open Marriage\u0027150 years ago to the day, the first Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field was adopted, declaring that even in times of war, a certain degree of humanity must be preserved. We are now calling for stricter compliance with this principle.President, Swiss ConfederationPresident, International Red CrossThe Video Music Awards have become a halfhearted, one-dimensional, and quite frankly inexplicable use of airtime, and in the post-TRL years have become about as relevant and vital as the music video itself.Blogger, Freelance JournalistOn 12 July, the two candidates in Afghanistan\u0027s presidential race agreed to resolve their contest through a complete audit of votes cast in the June run-off elections. The purpose of the audit is to determine the will of the millions of Afghans.Deputy Secretary-General, United NationsProcrastination happens when our goals are bigger than our energy levels, our time and even sometimes, our courage. When we look at something that at first seems so insurmountable, it\u0027s easy just to stuff everything back into our closest and place our body weight against the door to shut it closed, again.Author (All My Friends are Engaged) \u0026 Blogger (The Things I Learned From)Who would have thought that in 2014 we would be fighting to ensure that women are included in research on diseases and medical drugs and devices? If you find it outrageous, you are not alone.President and CEO of the Society for Women’s Health Research (SWHR®), the thought leader in research on biological differences in diseaseGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"THE END OF AIPAC?",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
