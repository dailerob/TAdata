{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"From md5summer.orgCNNMSNBCAPIn his seven-point response to my post on him, Joe Klein delivers this gem of sophistry: \"I had my doubts about my skepticism about the war...\" I know English is my second language, Joe, but let me get this straight: you weren\u0027t actually, as you have claimed, \"opposed to the war\" since 2002 -- you were \"skeptical\" of the war?
