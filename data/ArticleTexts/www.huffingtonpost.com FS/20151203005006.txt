{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteWestern governments that loose the dogs of war should stop assuming that their own people will not be bitten. Being a liberal democracy does not turn bombing and killing into an act of immaculate conception. Instead of pretending that their nations enjoy immunity from the inevitable horrors of war, Western officials should make the case to their people that the likely costs are worth the benefits. In this case that includes the possibility, perhaps likelihood, of terrorist attacks at home. There are no certainties even for America, which has done surprisingly well since 9/11. Which brings up the obvious question, why are the U.S. and its European allies involved \"over there\" -- and, in fact, currently intensifying their intervention?The two wars are connected by a common thread: the negative effects from an attempt by an elite minority to secure and control access to resources. The desire for resources has encouraged continual intervention, such as America\u0027s bases in the Mideast.Founder and CEO of the Global Institute For TomorrowKylie Jenner\u0027s photo and the conversation around it made me uncomfortable as a disabled person, but not just because she was using a wheelchair as a prop. I was uncomfortable when I read Tweets that suggested that the wheelchair was used as a prop to symbolize the \"limitations\" Kylie Jenner experienced through being famous.Disability rights activist, inclusive fashionista, grad student, and bloggerThe connection between the words used by both public officials and the alleged shooter is chilling, and it demands that we examine the vitriol used in debates about women\u0027s reproductive health, particularly coming from anti-choice activists.Chief Deputy WhipThe climate change negotiations in Paris will represent a challenge for China, India and the smaller nations. The region has a natural and legitimate right to economic expansion.Former President, East Timor, 1996 Nobel Peace Prize laureateThe Planned Parenthood shooting in my hometown was the 351st mass shooting in the U.S. this year. We have to talk about it. If we don\u0027t, I fear we will only see mass violence in our streets. Perhaps the people of Colorado are actually better equipped than most to untangle this knot we\u0027ve all tied.Nonprofit leader, writer, advocateVolunteering as a clinic escort is the most fulfilling, important thing that I do. The screams and the shaming and the cruel signs are just a reminder that the work that I do is meaningful and necessary. Clinic escorting is not about abortion; it\u0027s about humanity.Writer, Speaker, Feminist, Clinic Escort, Reproductive Rights Advocate#AllLivesMatter is a cousin to the knee-jerk reaction of \"stop making everything about race\" when someone points out clear, salient racial elements of an issue like police brutality. It\u0027s the cookie we want everyone to give us for not being a racist.Arts \u0026 culture journalist. Chicago is my heartbeat.We cannot afford to pretend that the hate we see today is only \"backlash\" to a terrorist attack. This is a prejudice and exclusion that has marred our nation\u0027s commitment to religious freedom and equality for years.Scholar-Activist, Campaign Director at Shoulder to Shoulder, Doctoral Candidate in Religion and Social Change at the University of DenverWhen does \"GMOS are unsafe\" or \"Vaccines are dangerous\" or \"Climate change isn\u0027t happening\" go from advocacy to falsely yelling \"Fire\" in a theater? Has ExxonMobil crossed that line? Greenpeace? The organics industry?Author, \u0027How Risky Is It, Really?\u0027We at BabyNames.com see a great influence of millennials on baby naming trends as evidenced by the rising popularity of computer-related names and the years the source material was popular.Board-certified nurse practitioner in psychiatry/mental health; co-founder of BabyNames.comIt may sound tough to say that the terror caused by radical Islamists is caused by radical Islam, but it\u0027s no more than a simplistic diversion from the more difficult strategic question about how a pluralistic society prosecutes a \"war on terror\" without discarding its foundational values.Editor, Jewish Daily ForwardSciencey Sun Venerator + Political CartoonsHillary\u0027s gender plays an extremely important role in this election, and it cannot and should not be ignored.Radio Personality at \"Zach Sang \u0026 The Gang,\" LA-based writer, producer and half of Daft Punk for all you know.Planned Parenthood is under attack. The 2016 GOP presidential candidates are fanning the flames of anti-abortion terrorists. The Republican Party is fueling incidents of violent extremism taking place at clinic locations across the country.Author of American Woman: The Poll Dance, Media Director for We Are WomanHow did #GivingTuesday catch fire so fast? As one of the small group of people who founded it back in 2012 under the leadership of Henry Timms, I have been thinking hard about how already it has come to far exceed even our wildest dreams -- although we hope it will do even more good in future.Co-author, \u0027Philanthrocapitalism: How Giving Can Save the World\u0027The eventual cost of corruption is not just that you build things you shouldn\u0027t, but you stop building things altogether. And the real cost of corruption in New York State -- and part of Sheldon Silver\u0027s legacy -- is the things we didn\u0027t do.CEO of MAYDAY.US, Associate Law Professor at Fordham, Corruption ScholarThanks, Amy, for showing the world that sexy isn\u0027t based on size. Thank you for teaching women to be okay with who they are and to go after what they want. Thanks for showing me that what matters is the obnoxious hyperventilation of my laugh and not the whiteness of the teeth I flash. Thank you for empowering me to channel my inner badass, and thank you for keeping me motivated throughout my recovery.Writer, world traveler, comedy nerd, wanna-be musician. Living vicariously through myself.Not enough people realize that three quarters of all psychiatric illness has its onset before the age of 24, and half before 14. And because kids are still developing, the earlier treatment is started, the better the prognosis.NFL wide receiver; Co-founder, PROJECT 375It\u0027s like a train wreck. Fascinating, repellant, and loud: all at the same time. Talking about the American presidential sweepstakes. And, as ratings for the last few debates seem to indicate, very hard to look away.Political comic, former radio talk show host, syndicated columnist, author, motivational speakerMothers have opinions about motherhood, this much is true. But let\u0027s not perpetuate the stereotype that every time we disagree it\u0027s out of judgment or cruelty.Mother, feminist, deep-breather, writer at TheMediocreMama.com.Most top Arab journalists and TV personalities are remarkably candid these days about their survival kit: hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil. After a brief lull, brought about by the Arab Spring, they have decided to support their governments and rulers and serve as their mouthpiece.A Jordanian journalist running Arab Reporters for Investigative JournalismLove yourself. When the world feels lonely, we have a real advantage when we are friends with ourselves.Writing, blogging, hoppy ale drinking, stay-at-home-yoga mama machine. Author of The Best Day of Your Life and The Art of Parenting.Paris must be a catalyst for stepped up climate action. The world must move towards a zero-carbon future. There is no room for short-sightedness or a lack of ambition. When a new climate deal is reached in December, as we hope and expect, let us all roll up our sleeves and get to work.Administrator, United Nations Development ProgrammeThe Sierra Club believes that a new model of trade that protects communities and the environment is urgently needed -- one that overturns the polluter-friendly model of the TPP.Director, Responsible Trade Program, Sierra ClubThe most successful outcome from this year\u0027s conference in Paris should be that participants understand that the issue of the climate is too important to be left just to the world\u0027s politicians.Don Tapscott heads the Global Solution Networks program at the University of Toronto and is Adjunct Professor of Management at the Rotman School of Management. His new book, Blockchain Revolution, comes out in May 2016.One can\u0027t dispute Republicans\u0027 concerns about terrorism\u0027s threat to national security, concerns which Democrats fully share, but one can argue how best to proceed -- and impugning Muslim refugees, again, plays into Islamic terrorism\u0027s hand.Writer and playwrightMy fear for COP 21 in Paris is that climate change stakeholders will look at taking measures, which will be unacceptable. Developed countries will be asked to pay for the pollution they have caused, while poorer countries will be asked to renounce on economic development to which they are entitled. The result will be wide-scale resistance!Initiator, Chairman and Pilot of Solar ImpulseRegardless of one\u0027s political or economic views, or scientific understanding of the topic, a lot is at stake for the world\u0027s environment and its economy, so our next choice of President matters.Former Secretary, California EPALawyers cannot give up working on a case, or put their own interests above their client\u0027s. And yet that is what two Texas lawyers appear to have done to death row clients they were appointed to represent.Professor of Law, University of VirginiaOne wonders whatever happened to the vigor with which the rights of LGBT people was put on the international agenda a few years ago.Managing Director, Center for Transatlantic Relations (CTR), Johns Hopkins UniversityGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
