{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThere\u0027s a ton of interesting analysis out in recent days on the quite explicit though often under-appreciated economic thrust of the March on Washington that took place half-a-century ago today. Economist Joseph Stiglitz and others note the lack of black progress on many key variables: income, poverty, wealth, employment. Richard Reeves adds an important and trenchant analysis of the black mobility gap. I agree with these facts, but want to add an additional, simple point which is in danger of getting overlooked: the evidence shows that Dr. King was right. Full employment is a substantial part of what it will take to achieve economic justice.Comments (21)Kirk DouglasActorI haven\u0027t smoked in over 40 years (I am 96 years old). Of all the drugs, smoking has the highest death rate -- more than 400,000 people per year (which is more than AIDS, alcohol, car accidents, illegal drugs, murders and suicides combined). Stop smoking and live longer!CommentsValerie JarrettSenior Advisor and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsAs we reflect on the tremendous progress made over the past half-century, we honor those brave leaders who paved the way, and upon whose shoulders we all stand, by recognizing our responsibility to undertake the immense job still at hand.CommentsJanus AdamsEmmy Award-winning journalist, historian and producerFor hours, speakers and singers, drum majors all, kept a steady beat until the time finally came for Dr. King to ascend the podium. His familiar baritone tuned like none other, he soothed us, rallied us, commended us on to heights untold. When he raised his hand over the crowd, invoking his Dream, I felt myself soar.CommentsClayborne CarsonStanford University HistorianDr. King used his remarkable oratorical skills to inspire listeners to believe that their struggles to free themselves from oppression were historically, globally, and morally significant.Comments (29)Suzanne PerrymanBlogger at SpecialNeedsMom.comIn your hurry to keep things neat and orderly, you didn\u0027t see the whole picture. You didn\u0027t see the wheelchair lift permanently installed into the back of my SUV, and you didn\u0027t see me unload my little girl\u0027s pink manual wheelchair that we use for \"quick\" trips.Comments (6,201)Randi WeingartenPresident, American Federation of TeachersThe March on Washington, and King\u0027s soaring oration, helped create a better world, but we are a long way from the world King dreamed of. So let us all take at least one lesson from King\u0027s example. Let\u0027s unite people of many faiths in a national day of prayer to end child poverty.Comments (18)Ella Frances SandersIntern, MaptiaAs Friedrich Nietzsche said, \"Words are but symbols for the relations of things to one another and to us; nowhere do they touch upon the absolute truth.\" Here, illustrated, are 11 words whose concepts cannot be properly explained across cultures.Comments (131)Heidi Grant Halvorson, Ph.D.Motivational psychologist and author, \"Succeed,\" \"Nine Things Successful People Do Differently\" and \"Focus\"If you\u0027re like me, and you find that your life has become more about pursuing peace and relaxation than giddy excitement, rest assured that you aren\u0027t missing out on happiness. Your happiness has evolved, just as you have.Comments (18)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesI recently married the man I\u0027ve been in a relationship with for 18 years. People ask if life is \"different\" now that we\u0027re \"legal.\" The answer is mostly no. One change, however, that is very real is the mild dilemma of how we call one another.Comments (109)Mike RyanSenior Entertainment Writer, The Huffington PostAs it turns out, Harrison Ford was suffering from dysentery on this particular day of filming and suggested that Indy just shoot the swordsman as opposed to doing another highly choreographed scene. What resulted is one of the most memorable moments in cinematic history.Comments (245)Thomas E. PerezU.S. Secretary of LaborWe can\u0027t understand what we\u0027ve accomplished on civil rights without telling the story of Bayard Rustin. And now, we must write the next chapter in the American civil rights story by drawing strength and inspiration from his moral courage.CommentsJames BoyleProfessor, Duke Law School; Founder, Center for the Study of the Public DomainToday is the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King\u0027s \"I Have a Dream\" speech.

Thus the speech may not be freely played on video or reproduced and costlessly distributed across the nation -- even today.CommentsNorman SolomonAuthor, \u0027War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death\u0027Without whistleblowers, the mainline media outlets are more transfixed than ever with telling the official story. And at a time like this, the official story is all about spinning for war on Syria.CommentsJerry A. CoyneProfessor, University of Chicago; Author, \u0027Why Evolution Is True\u0027When all these bells and whistles are used to gussy up what is essentially a mediocre song, you know there\u0027s something wrong. And the overweening thing wrong is that rock and roll is dead. It\u0027s had its run and now it\u0027s over.Comments (34)Miles RapoportPresident, DemosIn his speech at the Lincoln Memorial, the president movingly honored the sacrifice and commitment of the people who marched on Washington 50 years ago today. Then the president moved on and focused on what he called our \"great unfinished business.\"CommentsChristy Turlington BurnsFounder, Every Mother Counts, Director/Producer, NO WOMAN, NO CRY, global maternal health advocate, mom, modelEven though Haitian women are considered the \"poto mitan\"-- the \"central pillars\" of the family and their communities -- they are often the most underserved members of already poor communities.CommentsJohn GlaserEditor at Antiwar.comU.S. airstrikes won\u0027t neuter Assad\u0027s ability to continue to fight, may prompt worse violence from Assad, and may even directly kill more Syrian civilians. It seems clear these airstrikes are not about preventing more regime violence or saving the Syrian people. So what are they about?Comments (757)Jennifer Ketchambecomingjennie.comIf you are a parent, you might want to take notes, because this has more to do with you than you may wish to admit. In fact, these are the reasons why your daughter wants to be a porn star.Comments (89)Steve KenningBlogger, lineandbreak.comIt is literally beyond me to understand, with all this talk of \"Miley Cyrus\u0027 ass\" and \"Are we turning a blind eye to massive human rights violations in Syria?\u0027 how there hasn\u0027t been even one mention of how you\u0027re planning to help me celebrate my birthday.CommentsLee A. SaundersPresident, American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIOYes, we have survived the Great Recession and employment is up. But according to the Census Bureau, one-third of adults who live in poverty are working. They simply don\u0027t earn enough to support themselves and their families.Comments (42)Jeffrey LaurentiInternational affairs analyst and commentatorUnless it is embedded in a strategy to bring the Syrian adversaries to a compromise political deal to end the war, a U.S. air strike is a risky gamble that could well exacerbate and enlarge it, all for the modest gain of saving the president\u0027s face.CommentsKatelyn MullenHuffington Post Travel EditorFor those people who do have a food allergy of any kind, dining out and traveling can be incredibly stressful, especially those whose children are the ones with the issue. There are a ton of factors and scenarios that those who aren\u0027t affected by a food allergy never even think of, but in true Disney-fashion, they are one step ahead of their guests.Comments (11)Jane Williams and Susan SawyersThis week on Bloomberg EDU with Jane Williams, we asked Geoffrey Canada, president and chief executive officer of The Harlem Children\u0027s Zone, to talk about how Dr. Martin Luther King\u0027s dream looks right about now.CommentsBertha LewisPresident of The Black Institute \u0026 Former CEO and Chief Organizer of ACORNToday, we celebrate the 50-year anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.

The Fugitive  was a hit TV show. John Kennedy was in the White House. Jackie\u0027s pillbox hats were the height of fashion. And the minimum wage, when adjusted for inflation, was $8.37, a dollar and 12 cents higher than today\u0027s rate of $7.25.Comments (938)Lincoln MitchellHarriman Institute, Columbia UniversityHillary Clinton deserves credit for her good work at the State Department, but that tenure will very possibly be seen differently by 2016, and not because of Benghazi. The direction of foreign policy during the Obama administration will not fade away.Comments (234)James ClearEntrepreneur, weightlifter, and travel photographerWhat got you here won\u0027t get you there.
