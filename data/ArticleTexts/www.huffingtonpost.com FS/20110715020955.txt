{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghThe grim truth at the center of the debt ceiling and budget debate is that American wage earners have been played for fools and now are about to be victimized yet again -- by President Obama, by Congress, by our political class, by the media, by Washington\u0027s policy intellectuals who all have observed omertá about the coming cuts.

If we must have McConnell, it should be \"clean McConnell.\"Read Post | CommentsRabbi Shmuley Boteach, 7/14/11Rabbi and writerNot only is Levi Aron not part of the religious Jewish family, he is not part of the human family. He is a beast of the field, a cold-blooded predator, devoid of any spark of G-d or hint of humanity.
