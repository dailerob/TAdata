{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor at Columbia University and a Nobel Laureate in EconomicsThe near-global stagnation witnessed in 2014 is man-made. It is the result of politics and policies in several major economies -- politics and policies that choked off demand. In the absence of demand, investment and jobs will fail to materialize. It is that simple. Demand is what the world needs most. The private sector -- even with the generous support of monetary authorities -- will not supply it. But fiscal policy can. We have an ample choice of public investments that would yield high returns -- far higher than the real cost of capital -- and that would strengthen the balance sheets of the countries undertaking them. The big problem facing the world in 2015 is not economic. We know how to escape our current malaise. The problem is our stupid politics.The internal political situation is highly polarized between political forces playing with fear and insecurity and others capitalizing on anger and despair. This inflates extreme right and left populism. Much irresponsible and opportunistic rhetoric abounds. This polarization is squeezing out moderate left of center forces that historically have been fundamental in promoting democracy and reforms in Greece.Former Prime Minister of GreecePresidential aspirants in both parties are talking about saving the middle class. But the middle class can\u0027t be saved unless Wall Street is tamed. The Street\u0027s excesses pose a continuing danger to average Americans. And its ongoing use of confidential corporate information is defrauding millions of middle-class investors.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Why speak out about Bill Cosby now? The simple answer is that it\u0027s the right thing to do. The truth deserves to be known. As I write this, more than 20 women have come forward, many with stories that are remarkably similar to mine.Philanthropist and former entertainment executiveWe are a proud and hard-working people who saw our lives change abruptly, with the introduction of strict austerity measures. The new Prime Minister is promising to change all that.Editorial Director, HuffPost GreeceIn a new interview Laurent Léger, investigations editor of Charlie Hebdo and a survivor of the January 7th assault on the magazine\u0027s Paris office, condemned President Obama for his administration\u0027s attack on press freedom.Tinyrevolution.comIt has been clear that the Greek citizens have rejected, not just the austerity measures, but also the vicious, patronizing and corrupted political system, ruled for four decades by the conservative ND and the socialist PASOK.Deputy, Greece\u0027s Syriza partyThere is no place any longer, either in the NFL or the nation at large, for the injustices and hypocrisies of prohibitionist marijuana policies. It\u0027s time for the NFL to be a leader and create a rational and science-based marijuana policy.Retired 11-year NFL veteran, Super Bowl XXXIII championRetired NFL Super Bowl XLVII Champion; Fox Sports analystRetired 11-year NFL veteran and Super Bowl XLIV championIt\u0027s time for GrubHub to join other companies that have already banned shark fin products, like Disney, Amazon, Hilton, Marriott and the Starwood hotel group, and take action to protect sharks before it\u0027s too late.ActressCEO, OceanaEurope should count itself lucky that a leftwing anti-austerity party won the Greek elections, swept into office by citizens who\u0027ve had enough. Elsewhere in Europe, seven years of stupid, punitive, and self-defeating austerity policies have led to gains by the far right. If a radical left party is now in power in Athens and sending tremors through Europe\u0027s financial markets, the EU\u0027s smug leaders and their banker allies in Frankfurt, Brussels and Berlin have only themselves to blame. Alexis Tsipras, leader of the winning Syriza coalition, says he doesn\u0027t want Greece to leave the Euro. He just wants Europe\u0027s leaders to renegotiate Greece\u0027s debt. It\u0027s about time. This crisis could have ended years ago with far less suffering for ordinary people who had no responsibilities for the offending policies. Greece, after all, has about two percent of the EU\u0027s total economic product -- and it has about 25 percent less than it had before the crisis. Writing off Greece\u0027s debt outright would have cost peanuts, and still would.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027The Internet is simply an effective tool for connecting people. Whether the network becomes a force for good or evil is up to its users. It\u0027s only because millions of people have mobilized in defense of our rights to connect and communicate that the Internet pendulum occasionally swings toward doing good.Senior Director of Strategy, Free PressUnable to deprive women the right to abortion outright through the courts, the anti-choice movement has adopted a different strategy.U.S. Representative for California\u0027s 27th DistrictAmong those who apparently have not yet benefited much at all, at least so far, are owners of small businesses who would like to keep offering coverage to their employees but can no longer afford it. They can\u0027t afford it because insurers keep jacking their rates up so high every year that more and more of them are dropping employee health benefits altogether.Author, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgThe 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, which will be marked January 27 on International Holocaust Remembrance Day, comes at a time when some are asking: Is it happening all over again in Europe?National Director, Anti-Defamation LeagueTime and time again, Netanyahu has shown little respect for American presidents, institutions or interests despite the fact that we provide Israel with over $3 billion in aid annually and use our diplomatic capital to block anti-Israeli measures at the United Nations.Host, Cyber Law and Business Report; political columnist; internet lawyerYou think you\u0027ll remember every key moment of your kids\u0027 lives -- but you won\u0027t. Oddly enough, I can recall the theme song from \u0027Gilligan\u0027s Island\u0027 but I find it nearly impossible to draw out of cold storage a memory of my oldest kid\u0027s first bike ride.Senior Editor, HuffPost 50I was a little over a year sober when I really started the dating thing. I was confident with my sobriety, the person I was becoming, and thought for the first time in years that I may actually have something positive to offer to a relationship. But why was dating so uncomfortable?Blogger, www.itsalushlife.comReadily available calorie information is crucial for consumers to be able to make informed food choices throughout the day as they get their food from a variety of venues. Our nation is facing rising rates of obesity and chronic disease that continue to push health care spending higher.Senior Fellow at the Bipartisan Policy CenterSenior Fellow at the Bipartisan Policy CenterAfter all the status updates come the pictures. Kids in the snow, dogs in the snow, Grandma in the snow, rulers on the deck in the snow and, of course, just snow with the caption \"beautiful,\" or \"It\u0027s really coming down now.\"Wife, mom, writer, runner, sleep enthusiast, blogger at Outsmarted MommyAs the Senate wrestles with the Republicans\u0027 Keystone XL pipeline legislation, Rubio will be skipping town to bolster his presidential bid. This legislation has implications for fossil-fuel dependence and climate change. And one of its amendments may address offshore drilling in the senator\u0027s own state of Florida. But Rubio has a book to sell and a campaign to fund.Director, NRDC Action FundA big leap it is not from believing in god and the devil to believing in anything at all, including that the president is a radical Christian but also a Muslim and a foreign-citizen socialist who will take your guns away. Facts don\u0027t matter; we create a fictional order in the face of randomness and then call that real, and the chasm becomes ever wider.Scientist and former White House Senior Policy Analyst; Ph.D. in marine biology/neurophysiologyObama is proceeding to release small handfuls of detainees to places like Uruguay while asking congressional Republicans to lift their ban on sending Guantanamo detainees to high-security U.S. prisons. If those efforts prove fruitless, there now is a new way to achieve his promise.Former State Senator and leader of sixties peace, justice and environmental movement. Director of the Peace and Justice Resource Center.We have only a few days before Mr. Hill enters the death chamber. His execution will mock the Constitution and our common decency unless the courts intervene, now.Director, ACLU Capital Punishment ProjectA heavy shroud over this trial -- almost hidden by news media in plain sight -- has been context: the CIA\u0027s collusion with the Bush White House a dozen years ago, using WMD fear and fabrication to stampede the United States into making war on Iraq.Author, \u0027War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death\u0027What shocked me about the debate last night was the way Senate Majority Leader McConnell and the new Republican majority treated their colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Not only did Sen. McConnell go back on his word, he deprived the American people of a critical debate on these important amendments.U.S. Senator from CaliforniaWillful ignorance of climate science is troubling. Disregard of ecological science is destructive. The failure to utilize medical science can be life threatening. But my deeper concern is the attitude toward knowledge and learning expressed by these supposed national leaders.Executive Director, Columbia University\u0027s Earth InstituteGetting healthier is always a top priority for many of us around the new year as we come off of the holiday binge and look forward to summer. \"Healthy\" can mean different things to different people, but generally, feeling good, looking good and taking care of yourself fits the bill.Entrepreneur, CEO at One Mall GroupAs a physician and a researcher, I always like to know the source of health advice. Just because something is published in a science journal or reported on the news doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s true. You need to look at how a study is designed, as well as decide if it seems to make sense. Here\u0027s some health advice that you should think twice about.Former Chief Medical Expert and VP, Health and Medical Education at Discovery ChannelIt\u0027s startling that with something as important as hunger, something so basic as food supply still isn\u0027t universally understood.Author and host, \u0027Saving the Ocean\u0027 on PBSThe narrative goes something like this: We won the election, Republicans say, so Obama should now follow our lead. Of course, the problem with this line of thinking is that the president won two decisive victories in 2008 and 2012, and Republicans unleashed a wave of nothing.Univision America Host \u0026 contributor to NPR, The Hill, FoxNews Latino and other mediaReaganomics, the plot to appease the rich and condemn the rest, got its comeuppance last week in President Obama\u0027s State of the Union speech. The president asked: \"Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well?\"International President, United SteelworkersGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"\u0027TOP-FIVE HISTORIC STORM\u0027 ~30 MILLION WARNED DRIVING BAN IN NYC",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
