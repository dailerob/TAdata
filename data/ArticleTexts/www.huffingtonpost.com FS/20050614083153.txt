{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AriannaWhen I took my 16-year-old daughter to the premiere of Bewitched in New York Monday night (it’s a smart, funny, adorable and, yes, magical film), all anybody in the press line wanted to talk about was the Michael Jackson verdict. After swearing off their obsession with the trivial in the sober days following 9-11, the media, suffering from a serious case of attention deficit disorder, quickly returned to inhaling the seemingly irresistible fumes of celebrity scandal. Martha and Blake and Kobe and Peterson and Jackson, ad infinitum, ad nauseum… all culminating in Monday’s mindless, wall-to-wall coverage of the post-verdict analysis.And the worst part of it, as Harry Shearer and Paul Rieckhoff point out, is all the oxygen that this latest celeb-on-the-skids bacchanal consumes. Who knows, maybe if enough of us turned our backs -- and turned off our TVs -- we could get the media to change course. If not, you can start the countdown to the Phil Spector pre-jury selection analysis right now.READ MORE06.14.2005 Walter CronkiteI am joining the hundreds of thousands who shall be marching in the Virtual March on Washington to Stop Global Warming in order to demonstrate the concern that we all hold for the future of our planet and all the living things -- flora, fauna, human and animal -- that exist upon it. I want to be in that parade and if there is a place up front I\u0027d wish to lead the band or at least be assigned a big bass drum to help pound out the rhythm of glorious success.read whole post | permalink06.13.2005 Paul KrassnerWhen the Michael Jackson verdict was announced, my wife Nancy asked me if I thought they would have a big celebration in Neverland. “Sure,” I replied, “but Michael will sit at the children’s table.” Despite the fact that Jackson has been declared not guilty by a conscientious jury, he has become the unofficial pediophilia joke reference, from now to his obituary...read whole post | permalink | comments06.13.2005 Rep. John ConyersIn all of my years in Congress, I have never seen a phenomenon develop and grow like the controversy over these now infamous minutes, and the related corroboration. Amazingly, more than 540,00 Americans have joined with me in signing a letter to the President demanding answers and accountability. You can sign (and your friends, colleagues and family) by simply going to my web site and clicking the letter and filling out the information...read whole post | permalink | comments06.14.2005 Noah HelpernMorris: The role that McNamara played in American history is, to me, just endlessly fascinating. And what makes it even more disturbing is not that he was an evil man, or a man with bad intentions who did evil things, but that he was a man with good intentions who did evil things.read whole post | permalink | comments06.13.2005 Harry ShearerIt would seem sexy enough, journalistically, that the father of Freedom Fries turned against the war that spawned his original fame. Yet it took an appearance on the least-watched Sunday news yakfest to light the story\u0027s fire. Could it be that our major papers now don\u0027t believe it if they don\u0027t see it on TV?read whole post | permalink | comments06.14.2005 Nelson GeorgeA little over twenty years after the triumph of Thriller and now approaching middle age, Michael Jackson looks nothing like the little boy I admired. His skin is pale and chalky. He wears bizarre outfits. Although Jackson won’t go to jail for any of the 10 counts of child molestation or child endangerment he was on trial for, his life and career will remain tainted. His fascination with young boys – young white boys – is still disquieting. The details of his personal life unearthed during the trial will shadow him for the rest of his life.read whole post | permalink | comments06.13.2005 David CornAs the news side of the HuffPost noted, I had something of a scoop with an article reporting that FBI documents show that when Mark Felt (aka Deep Throat) was leaking to Woodward and Bernstein during Watergate he was also in charge of trying to find out who in the FBI was leaking to Woodward and Bernstein. (Click here to read the whole piece.) In the course of writing this article, I came across several delicious nuggets...read whole post | permalink | comments06.13.2005 Trey EllisIt was sort of exciting television watching the verdict come in on CNN. Watching the Jackson convoy roll in from Neverland, the helicopter camera crews chronicling every lane change and stop sign, forced comparisons with OJ’s white Bronco. Yet by now, after O.J., Martha Stewart and Robert Blake, these high-profile trials have all the luster of season five of Survivor. The thrill was in the first season, now they are just more feed for the insatiable maw of my TiVo. Still, as long as we’re here, what can we learn from all this?read whole post | permalink | comments06.13.2005 David SirotaThe GOP may try to make it seem as if any new initiatives on Iraq mean Democrats are just responding to polls. But, whatever - I\u0027ll take it. Hell, I\u0027ll take anything if it means more Democrats will stand up and give voice to the majority of Americans who want to see our Iraq policy seriously altered.read whole post | permalink06.13.2005 Paul FeigIs there anything stranger than seeing people jumping around and throwing confetti and hugging because Michael Jackson was acquitted of child molestation charges? No matter what one\u0027s thoughts about the verdicts were, there is something profoundly bizarre about people acting like the guy just threw the winning touchdown in the Super Bowl.read whole post | permalink | comments06.13.2005 Bruce CohenOf the hundreds of works I see by artists from 70 different countries, it feels like hardly any of it is two-dimensional paintings hanging on walls. Instead, I am met with a mind-expanding array of non-traditional sculptures, video pieces, performance art, site-specific installations and audience participation experiments. The art is falling and pouring off of the walls, completely blurring the lines between artist and audience, reality and fantasy (or, more appropriately these days, reality and scripted), art and life...read whole post | permalink | comments06.13.2005 Doug HellerAlthough his live announcement was bumped off the evening news to cover MJ, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger did indeed announce that Californians will go to the polls this November to vote on a series of initaitives that Schwarzenegger has been touting on behalf of big business. Knowing that Arnold\u0027s extra election is a self-serving waste of taxpayer money (there is another perfectly good and already budgeted election scheduled for next June), most Californians oppose Arnold on this one.read whole post | permalink06.13.2005 Max BlumenthalCable news can\u0027t get enough of Natalee Holloway. She\u0027s young, pretty, white, and missing -- the perfect human interest story. Geraldo Rivera gets spirited down to Aruba to sip daquiris and follow leads that don\u0027t exist. Meanwhile, there are hundreds of important stories that could have been told instead of, or in addition to, Holloway\u0027s. Some of them even involve missing women whose disappearances are actually part of a widespread kidnapping epidemic...read whole post | permalink06.13.2005 Carl PopeWell, things have heated up since the New York Times belatedly reported that Council on Environmental Quality staffer Phil Cooney, former lobbyist for the oil industry, had been censoring government science on global warming....although Cooney\u0027s role has been on the public record for two years, the media only just now decided it was newsworthy. I asked a former Times reporter last week how this happened, and he suggested that most likely the reporter had tried to get the story into the paper when it originally came up, but that the editors had squashed it and then later decided they had been wrong.read whole post | permalink | comments06.13.2005 Lyn Davis LearAfter checking with friends at the network, I’m very relieved to learn that the rumor that CBS had bowed to Vatican demands that no Jewish or gay people be allowed to work on the new special on the life of the Pope is absolutely untrue. In fact, I’m told there are gay people and Jewish people already working on the project. It’s sad that we live in a time where bigotry and pressure-group power is so prevalent that a story such as this one seems believable… and very good news that it turns out, as I had hoped, not to be true.read whole post | permalink06.13.2005 Mark JosephCrime is on the increase in Japan and not just any old crimes, but those of the weird and sadistic variety. At lunch with longtime friends they tell me that the country has changed radically as crimes have become random, purposeless and inexplicable. A few days later I see the story of a family of three who are awakened at 1 in the morning by a 20-year old man frantically knocking on their door. When they open it, he attacks them with a baseball bat and then drives off. None of the victims have any idea who he is.read whole post | permalink06.13.2005 Danielle CrittendenKickass43: hey!

I\u0027m glad you have not been caught in any recent mistakes and -- as I mentioned in my post -- you employ many fine journalists. But one reason your coverage may make fewer mistakes is that you do so little of the investigative reporting of business and government that is necessary for an informed citizenry.
