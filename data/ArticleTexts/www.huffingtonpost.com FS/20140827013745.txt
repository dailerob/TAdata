{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027There is a growing push by inflation hawks to get the Federal Reserve Board to raise interest rates. They argue that inflationary pressures are picking up steam and if the Fed doesn\u0027t move quickly, we will soon be caught up in an inflationary spiral. If this sounds obscure and esoteric, then you better do some quick homework. The Fed\u0027s decisions on the future course of interest rates will have a huge impact on the job prospects and livelihoods of tens of millions of families. If the Fed raises interest rates to prevent inflation, it would be slowing the economy and keeping people from getting jobs. Furthermore, slower job growth will weaken the labor market by raising the unemployment rate. This is a huge deal, especially for those at the middle and bottom of the economic ladder.For investigative reporting, injustice is the gift that just keeps giving. While so much of the business side of journalism remains in flux, fine reporters with an investigative urge are finding ways to shine much needed light into the parts of our global lives that the powerful would rather keep in the shadows.Director of the International Media, Advocacy and Communications specialization, Columbia University’s School of International AffairsI wasn\u0027t supposed to walk away from the NFL, but I did. I wasn\u0027t supposed to be writing television, but I am. I\u0027m supposed to be lost after football. I\u0027m not. I\u0027ve reinvented myself. This is my first transformation.WriterWhat are called a \"public schools\" in many of America\u0027s wealthy communities aren\u0027t really \"public\" at all. In effect, they\u0027re private schools, whose tuition is hidden away in the purchase price of upscale homes there, and in the corresponding property taxes.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Who cares if Burger King wraps its Whopper in the rainbow if the company is hurting the American economy, American taxpayers and American workers, including LGBT workers?Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesCertainly our conversations this week should remember the genius of Robin Williams. But we should also be talking about how to help prevent yet another tragedy. The way to help is to start seeing addiction as more than the craving for a substance relief.Richard Taite is founder and CEO of Cliffside Malibu, offering evidence-based, individualized addiction treatment based on the Stages of Change model. He is also coauthor with Constance Scharff of the book Ending Addiction for Good.Despite good grades, accomplishments, pleasant manners and common sense, many of our sons are seen as aggressive or prone to violence. When they transgress, as kids will always do, they are judged on a double standard.Blogger at Gays With KidsMy dad who died of ALS would be frustrated, as I am, that the Ice Bucket Challenge gives the political adversaries of scientific research a pretext to disguise their views and pretend they haven\u0027t made it harder to find a cure, for any disease at all.Associate Special Projects Editor, The Huffington PostSince a number of the discussions I\u0027ve recently had about the events in Ferguson, MO seem to devolve into accusations that I\u0027m either a racist, a liar or an idiot allow me to immediately address some facts that are not in disputeActor, ComedianA few years ago, if you had asked me about Silicon Valley\u0027s gender imbalance, I would have wondered what planet you were from. I believed it was a perfect meritocracy that was open and diverse.Academic, Researcher, Writer, EntrepreneurThe slaying of Michael Brown has cast a tragic pall over race relations in America, and the faces of his heart-broken parents provide the emblematic image of the summer of 2014. It should have been otherwise.Chief Executive Officer, The King CenterSen. Bob Corker told the Wilson Center last June that, looking back on more than a decade of armed conflict with al-Qaeda, Congress finds itself left with \"no ownership whatsoever\" of U.S. counterterrorism policy. He called the hands-off congressional approach \"totally feckless\" -- and he\u0027s right.Director, Woodrow Wilson Center; Former U.S. CongresswomanWe\u0027ve got to decide do we want freedom, justice and power with a clear vision on how to get to those places, or if we only want to vent and spit, until the next Michael Brown is killed.Public speaker and activist; author, \u0027Barack Obama, Ronald Reagan, and the Ghost of Dr. King: Blogs and Essays\u0027Apparently U.S. history began when Barack Obama was inaugurated. In case you were unaware, he is evidently the first president to take vacations; he\u0027s the first president to play golf; he\u0027s the first president to be photographed without a suit or tie; and he\u0027s the first president to routinely use a teleprompter.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027Are you a member of a gym? Want to try a new exercise or class but not sure what to expect! You\u0027re in luck because I embarrassed myself by trying every fitness trend in the industry and broke it down for you.Double board certified in Internal Medicine and Allergy \u0026 ImmunologyRepublic Report has obtained a toughly-worded 17-page letter sent on Friday from the U.S. Department of Education to collapsing for-profit Corinthian Colleges, with the government charging that Corinthian\u0027s Everest Institute misrepresented job placement statistics at its Decatur, Georgia, campus to the school\u0027s accrediting agency and to students.Attorney, advocate, writer at RepublicReport.orgThe media stories have been legion, the words expended many. And yet, as attention shifts elsewhere (even though the children continue to arrive), the real factors that would have made sense of what\u0027s been happening remain essentially untouched and largely unmentioned. It couldn\u0027t be stranger -- or sadder.Professor of History and Coordinator of Latin American Studies at Salem State UniversityWhy should we boycott Burger King just because they are avoiding their US tax responsibilities? Because if they don\u0027t pay their fair share of US taxes, someone else has to, and that someone is you.Bestselling author and professor of finance at SP Jain whose new 2014 book is entitled \u0027Why Diets Fail: Because You’re Addicted to Sugar\u0027Sheryl Sandberg\u0027s \"lean in\" philosophy takes the baton from Ms. Steinem, advancing and putting new emphasis in our relationship world that suggests equality isn\u0027t just about the workplace, economics, or sexuality, but is also about the kitchen, the kids, and household chores.Author, political writer, relationship expert.The flood of commentary with regards to ISIS, as usual, reveals little in the way of rigorous logic. Also as usual, tactics eclipse strategy. Serious governments, especially that of a super power, should not conduct their foreign relations in a state of histrionics.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghWhile debate swirls about a racially biased justice system and evidence leaks predominate in the news media, another issue deserves scrutiny: the extensive legal hurdles prosecutors must clear in cases like this.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityIt is clear that women are caught in a cruel game of moving one step forward to be pushed two steps back. We have seen a disappointing picture of what can happen because women are not acknowledged in the Constitution.U.S. Representative for New York\u0027s 12th District; Ranking House Member, Joint Economic CommitteeThe core problem with the Liberal Zionists, the key reason that they are politically moribund, is not that they believe in Zionism, but that they do not believe in organizing effective pressure on the Israeli government to bring about the policies that the Liberal Zionists claim to support.Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicyThe UN Security Council dramatically escalated the conflict with al Qaeda splinter groups by passing UN Resolution 2170. This UN Security Council is the latest in a series of draconian UN Resolutions against terror groups pursuant to its responsibility of forgotten obligations.Visiting Fellow, Brookings Doha CenterNot long ago, Malcolm Gladwell made a bold prediction: Fifty years from now, Apple will be around and Microsoft will be gone, but Bill Gates will be remembered -- and Steve Jobs won\u0027t. As surprising as it seems, Gladwell might be right.Wharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027Today on Women\u0027s Equality Day, we commemorate the passage of women\u0027s right to vote -- celebrating how far we have come, but also recognizing the work that remains. Sometimes it seems like women are the only people coming together across party lines to get things done.Kentucky Secretary of State; Democratic Candidate for US SenateIn 1978, a passionate 14-year-old boy did what ARPANET experts thought was impossible.Director of High Performance and Research Computing Division, Rutgers Medical SchoolWhat is needed is exactly what the Kerner Commission recommended to the country 46 years ago: a comprehensive shift in the priorities of our social spending away from the military-industrial-prison complex and toward widespread development of impoverished parts of America.Professor, historian, authorDespite an appeal over the controversial Rocky Branch strip mine permit still pending with an administrative judge, Peabody Energy defiantly crossed closed public roads and moved massive mining equipment in Saline County yesterday, in preparation to carry out its already violation-ridden and state-subsidized mine operation.Journalist/Historian, www.jeffbiggers.comThe more fiercely I love, the brighter and more beautiful the world can appear. However, each time I feel that joy and connectedness, the more I fear and mourn its loss, even while I still have it. It is in that empty pause that depression is born.Artist and blogger living in Ramstein, GermanyToday marks Women\u0027s Equality Day. It is also a little more than two months from the 2014 midterm elections. In my mind, these two things are inextricably linked.President, National Organization for WomenGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"OBAMA PURSUING \u0027SWEEPING\u0027 INT\u0027L CLIMATE ACCORD",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
