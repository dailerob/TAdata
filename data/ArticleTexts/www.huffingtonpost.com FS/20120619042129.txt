{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Some say the left should tout the merits of \"government.\" That is a great idea, if the point is to advance the conservatives\u0027 agenda. It is astounding how happy liberals are to work for the right by implying that conservatives somehow just want to leave markets to themselves whereas the liberals want to bring in the pointy-headed bureaucrats to tell people what they should do. This view is, of course, nonsense. Pick an issue, any issue, and you will almost invariably find the right actively pushing for a big role for government. However, for conservatives the goal is not ensuring a decent standard of living for the bulk of the population. Rather the goal is ensuring that money is redistributed upward. And, of course, the conservatives are smart enough not to own up to their use of the government.Read Post | Comments (163)David Brody, 06/18/12White House Correspondent, CBN NewsI know this may come as a shock to some in the mainstream media but evangelicals don\u0027t just care about the life and marriage issues... They see the Tea Party movement as a way to reclaim this country\u0027s Judeo-Christian heritage.Read Post | Comments (362)Janet Tamaro, 06.18.2012Creator, Writer, \u0026 Executive Producer, \"Rizzoli \u0026 Isles\"As fans prepare to dive into a new season with their favorite Boston crime solvers, we checked in with Janet Tamaro to get her thoughts about the show she developed based on characters created by author Tess GerritsenRead Post | Comments (11)Will Bunch, 06/18/12Author, \u0027The Backlash\u0027The real crimes of the last 40 years didn\u0027t fit into the box that Woodward and Bernstein and the Watergate scandal helped to create. In the end, the real exceptionalism of Richard Nixon was merely that he was dumb enough to get caught. The rest of them all got away with it.Read Post | Comments (114)Marty Kaplan, 06/18/12Director, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolThe consequence of being a citizen who cares about issues like carbon footprints, peak oil and rising temperatures is a feeling of powerlessness. The oligarchs have us by the short hairs. If you aren\u0027t feeling impotent, you haven\u0027t been paying attention.Read Post | Comments (137)Rachida Dati, 06/18/12Member, European ParliamentWe must not be guilty of not having done enough for the Syrian people.

Arne Duncan, 06/18/12U.S. Secretary of EducationA few days ago, I went to my 10-year-old daughter\u0027s band concert. It was a great evening, and after the show a few parents told me they were surprised I\u0027d made it, considering my schedule -- which got me thinking.Read Post | Comments (22)Mark Ruffalo, 06/18/12Actor/DirectorFor too long, Main Street has been working in the interests of Wall Street when it should be the other way around. A Robin Hood Tax gives us an opportunity to rewrite that script and get America back on its feet.Read Post | Comments (49)Keli Goff, 06/18/12Author, Commentator and Contributing Editor, TheLoop21.comWhy is it that law enforcement seems incapable of protecting children from offenders like Moland, who, despite proving themselves to be dangerous parents, are not held accountable for any future parenting choices they may make?Read Post | CommentsChris Weigant, 06/18/12Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comCan any Romney supporter explain exactly what Mitt\u0027s position is on the Rubio/Obama \"mini DREAM Act\"? Having no position -- or every possible position at the same time -- is simply indefensible when you consider the job he\u0027s running for.Read Post | CommentsRobert Redford, 06/18/12Actor, director, and environmental activistWe should not be subsidizing the destruction of our planet. Fossil fuels are literally cooking our planet, polluting our air and draining our wallets.

It\u0027s not an homage and it\u0027s not a theme song or something. It\u0027s just how I felt after spending time with those characters. Which is all that means. Maybe that makes it more subjective but I guess that\u0027s the point.Read Post | CommentsJessica Prois, 06/18/12Editor, HuffPost ImpactTypically, the patterned coverage about Africa includes grim statistics about starving children coupled with archetypical images of sullen young faces and swollen bellies. We\u0027re not going to focus on painting that dire portrait this time.Read Post | CommentsGeorge Lakoff and Elisabeth Wehling, 06/18/12Where Romney talks morality (conservative style), Obama mainly talks policy. Where Romney reframes Obama, Obama does not reframe Romney. In fact, he reinforces Romney\u0027s frames by repeating Romney\u0027s language word for word -- without spelling out his own values explicitly.Read Post | Comments (123)Douglas Anthony Cooper, 06/14/12Novelist, Amnesia (See: Blogger Mortis)Currently, the headquarters of PETA in Norfolk, VA kills 97 percent of the animals delivered into its care.

It\u0027s that the markets have too much power to destroy economies. Let\u0027s not forget -- this entire crisis was caused because markets mispriced risk.Read Post | Comments (376)Mitchell Bard, 06/17/12Writer and FilmmakerIt makes one wonder: Would the Michigan Republican leadership have banned a male conservative representative for using the term \"vagina\" in the debate? Somehow I doubt it.Read Post | Comments (760)Abby Huntsman, 06/17/12Political ContributorIf he\u0027s able to convince (or even scare) Americans that a vote for Romney is a vote for \"what got us into this mess,\" it might be a tipping point in swinging support to his corner.Read Post | Comments (308)Robert Greenberg, 06/18/12Author, Composer, Music HistorianIt\u0027s a moment that calls for some music, something that will calm, edify, enthrall, engage, distract and transport the little darlings to sleepy-land, so that the adults might move off to an appropriately distant room and watch Game of Thrones.Read Post | Comments (12)Larry Magid, 06/18/12Technology journalistI have to admit I was tempted by the 15-inch Macbook Pro with retina display.
