{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna Huffington\"Our life together can be better.\" That\u0027s the opening sentence of an important new book by Jim Wallis called On God\u0027s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn\u0027t Learned About Serving the Common Good. Wallis wrote it while taking a three-month sabbatical last year, in the midst of the 2012 election -- a break that allowed him to get a broader perspective on what was going on in American public life. The book draws inspiration from Abraham Lincoln\u0027s famous line: \"[M]y concern is not whether God is on our side; my greatest concern is to be on God\u0027s side...\" For Wallis, the key to being on God\u0027s side is a focus on the common good. But, as Wallis saw vividly during his sabbatical, that doesn\u0027t seem to be the direction things are currently headed in our country. Instead of strengthening our commitment to equality, social justice, and our sense of unity as a nation, our public and political discourse is breaking us apart.Comments (26)Jim CarreyActorHow shallow do they think I am?

Why? Because he knows small businesses are responsible for creating two out of every three new jobs in the United States.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThe recent rise in stock prices is largely a function of historically high corporate earnings (derived in part by squeezing workers and their wages) and very low interest rates, courtesy of the Federal Reserve (and, not to be a sourpuss, but for the record, the recent market highs are not all-time records once you adjust for inflation).Comments (36)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Their agreement on is very preliminary and hasn\u0027t yet even been blessed by the so-called Gang of Eight senators working on immigration reform, but the mere fact that AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka and Chamber of Commerce President Thomas J. Donohue agreed on anything is remarkable.Comments (63)Sen. Debbie StabenowU.S. Senator from MichiganOver the last few months the country has been engaged in an in-depth conversation about guns.

El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOWherever they look, Cyprus and its European partners are running out of easy options. Rather than seek additional short-term palliatives, they would be well advised to invert their operational logic.Comments (38)Carl J. SchrammUniversity Professor, Syracuse; Co-author, \u0027Better Capitalism\u0027In light of the apparent uncertainty over the role that entrepreneurs can really play in \"saving\" the economies of cities, perhaps its time to think about how cities with failing economies can reset their economic compass and begin to lay the groundwork for economic growth.CommentsPaul GondreauProfessor of Theology, Providence CollegeWhy is the whole world so moved by images of this embrace? A woman in the Square, moved to tears by the embrace, perhaps answered it best when she said to my wife afterward, \"You know, your son is here to show people how to love.\"Comments (29)John R. TalbottAuthor, \u0027Survival Investing: How to Prosper Amid Thieving Banks and Corrupt Governments\u0027We know that 2/3 of North Korea\u0027s people are suffering from malnutrition.

WinogradDirector, No Kill Advocacy CenterPeople for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) is an organization that publicly claims to represent the best interest of animals -- indeed their \"ethical treatment.\" Yet approximately 2,000 animals pass through PETA\u0027s front door every year and very few make it out alive.Comments (24)David WygantDating and relationship coach, authorOn the surface, he looks like the All-American dad; on the surface, he looks like a great husband; on the surface, he tells everybody that it\u0027s OK that his marriage isn\u0027t passionate -- he\u0027s grown so much as an individual that he doesn\u0027t need wild, fulfilling sex anymore. But he\u0027s lonely.Comments (235)Larry MagidTechnology journalistIt\u0027s a scary thought and a reminder of how this \"global village\" we live in is so interconnected that we can no longer afford to ignore problems that affect \"other people,\" because they can affect us, too.CommentsHaley Cohen and Howard DeanThis is a generation which believes that as individuals they have the power to effect real change, not always by transforming our institutions, but by ignoring and circumventing them when necessary.CommentsGordon BrownFormer Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationA third Pakistani school has been attacked in an escalating wave of violence by Taliban militants determined to stamp out the provision of girls\u0027 education.
