{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Robert L. BorosagePresident, Institute for America\u0027s FutureIn a State of the Union address that lasted more than an hour, President Obama challenged Congress to raise the minimum wage, announced he would act immediately to issue an executive order lifting the lowest wages of government contract workers, and urged companies to give Americans a raise as well. This was far from the president\u0027s best speech, but as Republican CNN Analyst Alex Castellanos quipped in the best line of the night, \"a speech by Barack Obama is a lot like sex. The worst there ever was is still excellent.\" The president went through a long laundry list of proposals and actions, intent on demonstrating that this could be a \"year of action,\" with or without the Congress. But the most telling parts of the speech were not the proposals but the framing.Comments (34)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorToday\u0027s minimum wage is 22 percent below its late 1960s peak, after adjusting for inflation. Raising it to the $10-an-hour range would help to offset some of the unfavorable trends facing low-wage workers, including stagnant or falling real wages and inadequate bargaining power that leaves them solidly on the \"have-not\" side of the inequality divide.Comments (30)Dario GilDirector of Cognitive Enterprise at IBM ResearchIn five years, things will undoubtedly be very different.

Rushmore explode, etc. But here\u0027s what neither will tell you.Comments (453)Martha BurkMoney Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsFor years I played the \"drinking game\" during the State of the Union speech, but it got so I couldn\u0027t make a dent in a single glass of wine when it came to counting the number of times the word \"women\" was uttered.Comments (17)Rep. Debbie Wasserman SchultzAuthor, \u0027For the Next Generation\u0027; Chair, Democratic National CommitteeA raise of the federal minimum wage is one of those common-sense proposals that is both good for the economy and good for the country. Considering there has not been an increase since July 2009, workers who depend on these wages have been losing income to inflation for over four years. A raise is long overdue.Comments (13)Paul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostIn the end, good news porn can be like sexual porn in that there is no real commitment, engagement or sacrifice involved. Good news is presented for our enjoyment, and when we are done, we can move on without any thought for those whose lives we just consumed.CommentsKirk LundgrenResident of Charleston, West VirginiaDear Mr. President: I am writing you as a dutiful, concerned, and stressed-out husband and expectant father from Charleston, West Virginia.

We need to bring more attention to these efforts, in order to spur a new and vigorous approach to more effective giving around the world.CommentsNina BahadurAssociate Editor, HuffPost WomenRegardless of an author\u0027s color, sexuality, gender identity, or anything else about them, it\u0027s a near-certainty that commenters will tear them down. Commenters will say, \"you are wrong.\" They\u0027ll say, \"what do you know about this topic?\" They\u0027ll say, \"you have the wrong priorities.\" They\u0027ll say, \"you can\u0027t speak for me.\"CommentsRev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkThis must be a year when we rise together peacefully and not only let our voices be heard, but let our actions unequivocally speak for themselves. For the only way to fight against inequality is to bring about more justice for every man, woman and child.CommentsMarielena HincapiéExecutive director, National Immigration Law CenterWe do not know whether Speaker Boehner can muster the political will to bring a bipartisan immigration reform bill to the floor. No bill can pass without support from both sides. But we know that Congress\u0027s failure has taken a devastating toll on families.Comments (15)Ruth Bettelheim, Ph.D.Psychotherapist; Executive/life coachAmerican leaders are beginning to address the deficits in our country\u0027s early education system.

So let\u0027s get started.Comments (36)Carolyn MugarExecutive Director, Farm AidSocial change is the cumulative result of this constant sowing, handful by handful, lyric by lyric, person by person.
