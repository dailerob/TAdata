{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Thomas PikettyAuthor, \u0027Capital in the Twenty-First Century\u0027The main message coming from my book, Capital in the Twenty-first Century, is not that there should always be a deterministic trend toward ever rising inequality (I do not believe in this); the main message is that we need more democratic transparency about wealth dynamics, so that we are able to adjust our institutions and policies to whatever we observe. I welcome all criticisms and I am very happy that the book has stimulated a global debate about very important social and economic issues. But my problem with the FT\u0027s criticism, in particular, is twofold. First, I did not find it particularly constructive. The FT suggests that I made mistakes and errors in my computations, which is simply wrong. Secondly, the FT\u0027s more important corrections are based upon methodological choices that are quite debatable, to say the least.To know that there is finally a light at the end of the tunnel, and it\u0027s not an oncoming train -- it becomes a refilling of hope, a refilling of belief in our justice system.Raymond SantanaYusef SalaamWhat you\u0027re about to read is a terrible story that I feel conflicted about telling. I\u0027m sharing it now, in part, because I think it has something to add to the ongoing conversation about sex, violence and entitlement, and also because I hope it will help someone else make better choices than I did.Carol HartsellSenior Comedy Editor, The Huffington PostIt\u0027ll be Brain-Damage-Gate and Benghazi-Gate. If they\u0027re not flogging either of those topics, it\u0027ll be a journey through the space-time continuum to the jolly old \u002790s, with all of the Bill Clinton-era conspiracy theories re-emerging like a zombie apocalypse.Bob CescaManaging Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowI see the ACA\u0027s positive impact first-hand in my home state, a place whose collective poor health has long been jeopardizing the lives and financial security of hard-working families who can\u0027t seem to get ahead.Gov. Steve BeshearGovernor of KentuckyThere will be bad bosses -- male and female. There will also be good bosses -- male and female. College graduates considering choosing a boss based on perception only serves to reinforce certain stereotypes.Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarYou should beware of those pundits today who disparage creating greater access to a college education. Under the guise of practicality, this is old-fashioned, elitist condescension combined with a desire to protect the status quo of inequality.Michael RothPresident, Wesleyan UniversityGoogle just revealed that 17 percent of its technology staff is female. That is impressive compared with the rest of Silicon Valley, but not once you put it in the context of the available pool of female computer scientists.Vivek WadhwaAcademic, Researcher, Writer, EntrepreneurIn the new documentary Fed Up, author and journalist Michael Pollan reminds us that: \"Junk is still junk, even when it\u0027s less junky.\" If you want to see what Pollan is talking about, soon all you\u0027ll need to do is walk into a classroom in a low-income school district at breakfast time.Nancy HuehnergarthPresident, Nancy F. Huehnergarth ConsultingThe death of American poet Maya Angelou has been greeted with both grief and accolades for her contributions to the American literary canon. But it also has stirred memories of her early support for a controversial man, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.Phillip MartinSr. Investigative Reporter WGBH Radio Boston; Sr. Fellow Schuster Institute for Investigative Journalism, Executive Editor Lifted Veils ProductionsYou probably realize that identity thieves are after your email addresses and passwords, but that\u0027s not all they want.Adam LevinFormer Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911If you are an American human being today, you probably labor under the illusion of having a self, as Rust Cohle put it, but what you really are is a sadly predictable agglomeration of demographic traits and buying habits.Mark GongloffChief financial writer, The Huffington PostCrossFit seems to think that the more pain you are in, whether on that day or the days following the workout, the better. The more you disregard the pain and keep pushing through it, the \"tougher\" you are. But this is not true, and more importantly, it\u0027s not healthy.Erin SimmonsFormer athlete, coach, health and fitness promoterIt\u0027s interesting to see how some have foolishly engaged in a debate about why Snowden has not \"come home to face the music.\" What does that mean? he should come home and go to jail? Are we romanticizing and putting nobility on being locked up? Really?Davey DOakland resident, social justice avocate, adjunct professor, host of \u0027Hard Knock Radio\u0027 94.1 FMBeing alone does not mean you have to be lonely. And it certainly doesn\u0027t mean you have to spend every waking hour looking for someone to share your alone time with.Chevonne HarrisEditor, AdoreColour.comMay this disaster -- in which the fury of the gods seems to have taken up where human fury left off -- at least serve to cast Bosnia\u0027s plight in sharp relief. May it remind each and every one of us of the duty to remember and repair that is our most fitting response to the outrage of 20 years ago.Bernard-Henri LévyBernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.Who was it who once said, \"Youth is full of pleasure, age is full of care?\" Ah, yes, that would be William Shakespeare (who, incidentally, died just three days short of his 52nd birthday -- which was considered quite old at the time).Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistThere\u0027s no reason for coups to have such enduring appeal. Like those recurring bouts of malaria, they often lead to nothing but more coups. Treating the fever is not enough. We have to look at the underlying infection of the body politic.John FefferCo-director, Foreign Policy In FocusThese 10 songs will be forever connected to the joyous, frightening and heart-tugging images of the films they appeared in.Robert PriceTeacher, techie, loud mouth and all around nusianceOn May 18 the Times ran an article about the threat of privacy invasion now that software programs not only identify who you are by using hidden cameras to scan your face but then link to your Facebook posts and other sources of information about you that you didn\u0027t know you were providing. The article didn\u0027t mention the next step in privacy invasion, just around the corner.Paul EkmanProfessor Emeritus of Psychology, University of California, San Francisco20. If you\u0027ve gotten five straight hours of deep sleep in the past few years it\u0027s because you were having surgery or in the hospital.Meredith Franco MeyersEverywhere I sense a shift in the seasons, a yearning for greater purpose, for moving with empathy as well as pragmatism -- a growing understanding that we are all in this together.Jacqueline NovogratzFounder and CEO of AcumenThat\u0027s what writing a novel is like. No matter the precautions and preparation, dangers abound. The game is rigged; the odds of success and survival are not good. MFA vs. NYC? Yeah, sure, exactly. Whatever it takes, however you get there, and everything in between.Andrew Lewis ConnAuthor of O, AFRICA! and P.Nancy Pelosi and John Kerry just blinked. After resisting Republican calls for yet another investigation into the 2012 attack on the US Consulate in Benghazi, and after resisting calls for the Secretary of State to testify, they have both suddenly folded. A full scale capitulation. Or is it?Peter WattsCommunications Coach and AnalystIn every culture, and every industry, research identifies givers, takers, and matchers. Givers are generous: they help others with no strings attached. Takers are selfish: they try to get as much as they can from others. Matchers are fair: I\u0027ll do something for you, if you do something for me.Adam GrantWharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027Throughout her life, Dr. Angelou eloquently presented a powerful and unique expression of what we can become and what we must leave behind.Al GoreChairman, Generation Investment Management and The Climate Reality ProjectWho is an editor? Editors need no license to practice. Anyone, including bloggers, can claim that they are editors and hence claim to be free to publish classified information. Should all these persons be shielded from the consequences of their actions?Amitai EtzioniProfessor of international relations, George Washington UniversityFine, here\u0027s what happened to Andy\u0027s dad.Jon NegroniAuthor of The Pixar Theory and other online essaysHers was a life born of nothingness, of vicious sexual assault, of shattered boulevards and smashed glass windows. But from the muck of that life, Maya Angelou became a voice for girls, for women, and even for boys like me.Kevin PowellPublic speaker and activist; author, \u0027Barack Obama, Ronald Reagan, and the Ghost of Dr. King: Blogs and Essays\u0027I was listening to an interview with Tim Geithner this weekend, and after going through his new book, they asked him where he thought the economy was headed. \"I don\u0027t believe forecasts,\" he said, which sounded smart to me.Jared BernsteinFmr.
