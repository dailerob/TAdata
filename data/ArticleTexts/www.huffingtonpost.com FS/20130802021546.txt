{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jeff MadrickRoosevelt Institute Senior Fellow; author, \u0027Age of Greed\u0027The reason Larry Summers has become a leading candidate for Federal Reserve chairman is because President Obama is now leaning his way. No, I don\u0027t have direct proof of that, but some journalists claim they have heard this from insiders. And the reason this is credible is that Obama is a centrist on economic issues. Contrary to some claims, there are no mysteries about Summers\u0027s view on monetary economics. Inflation is his big concern, as was Alan Greenspan\u0027s. If Summers is appointed, we will return to the era of bond trader dictatorship. Obama simply wants protection from \u0027inflationary expectations,\u0027 the bugaboo of the Clinton 1990s. Any sign that the bond traders will push up rates for fear a strengthening economy will generate inflation will provoke a quick reaction from Summers. He is far more likely to crack down on the economy than his competitor, the estimable Janet Yellen.Comments (66)Bob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowTed Nugent and Rand Paul aren\u0027t joking.
