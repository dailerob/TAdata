{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027Perpetrators of hate crimes often take their cues from what they hear in the media. And the recent inclination of some politicians to use inflammatory rhetoric is contributing to a climate of hate and fear. I\u0027m not suggesting Trump, Carson, Fiorina, or any other presidential candidate is directly to blame for hate crimes erupting across America. But by virtue of their standing as presidential candidates, their words carry particular weight. They have a responsibility to calm people with the truth rather than stir them up with lies. In suggesting that the staff of Planned Parenthood, Muslims, Black Lives Matter protesters, and Mexican immigrants are guilty of venal acts, these candidates are fanning the flames of hate.The battle to stop climate change is entirely winnable. Only a very small number of people stand in the way. But they are very wealthy, powerful, corrupt people, and the hour is growing late. Do we let them win? It\u0027s #TimeToChoose.Director, Wall Street documentary \u0027Inside Job\u0027; Author, \u0027Predator Nation\u0027It is cause for concern that France, with its proud identity as a bastion of civil liberties, is now joining a dubious list of governments that use security as a justification to cut down on individual rights.Founder and Chair, Bianca Jagger Human Rights FoundationI can only urge you to think of your grandchildren, as I think of mine, and of those billions of people without a voice; those for whom hope is the rarest of sensations; those for whom a secure life is a distant prospect. Most of all, I urge you to consider the needs of the youngest generation, because none of us has the right to assume that \"for our today they should give up their tomorrow.\"HRH The Prince of WalesImagine if a Muslim gunman had opened fire at an American shopping center on Black Friday, shot eleven people and killed three, including a police officer. Do you think CNN would have broken away from programming just hours after the shooter was apprehended in order to air a pop culture documentary?Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaIn this increasingly interconnected world, only real and lasting resilience -- achieved by way of innovative, systems-deep approaches -- will allow us to solve for multiple problems at once, both now and on into the future. Here are seven potentially game-changing trends we believe will be the next frontier of climate resiliencePresident of The Rockefeller FoundationBecause I am confident about the future of banking. Since 2008, we have implemented many changes. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said this summer that \"reform is strengthening the resilience of major banks.\"Executive Chairman, Santander GroupMonuments, as symbols, project values, not neutral representations of the past.SOBA Presidential Professor in the Political Science Department of Johns HopkinsI am appalled by my devastated country, and I am devastated by the death of my daughter.Journalist, writer, documentary filmmakerBreakthroughs in scientific medical research have prompted AIDS activists and politicians to envision \"an AIDS-free generation.\" UNAIDS has begun a countdown to zero: \"no new HIV infections, no discrimination, and no new AIDS deaths.\"Behavioral economist, University of DelawareThe next five years will be very important, and the longer we wait to put measures into effect, the harder it will become to minimize climate change.President of WWF FranceThe refusal to call Roof -- and now Dear -- a \"terrorist\" is far from an arcane quibble over terms and definitions, or even over the race and gender of the shooters. It strikes to the heart of how Americans have been reflexively conditioned to see thuggery and terrorism.Author and political analystCertainly, there has never been a stranger or more unsettling Republican campaign for the presidential nomination or one more filled with economic balderdash and showmanship.Distinguished Senior Fellow, DemosLife is passionately defended only if the subject of concern is fetal life. \"Right-to-life\" politicians are often vehement supporters of the death penalty, seemingly oblivious to the obvious internal inconsistency in their attitudes to the beginning and the ending of life.Professor Emeritus, Duke UniversityWe could argue that the humanitarian benefits to the refugees themselves should be enough. We should accept refugees because failure to do so would be abandoning our moral obligations. But since some dismiss the humanitarian argument, here are four non-humanitarian reasons to take in refugees.Director of Immigration Policy, Niskanen CenterDo you sincerely believe that at the end of the day, Goldman Sachs cares more about social impact than about financial returns?Immediate Past President and CEO, Social Enterprise AllianceThere has been far too much self-congratulation on the part of white America about what has already been accomplished. At the same time, the deeper patterns of institutional racism will not be solved on America\u0027s campuses, and there are limits to what a college president can do.Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Today, Republican front-runner Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with 100 leading Black pastors, some who said they may be endorsing him and others who said they just want to hear him out.President, National Action NetworkWe are entering a period of rapid societal transformation. Where traditions will morph, and limitations of decades past will lift allowing us to recreate our social networks and celebrations.Chairman/CEO, XPRIZEA firm leadership and decisive action is required to push back the disruptive efforts of radical Islam and Russian efforts to destabilize the EU and mess up our societies. We should not be fooled. The interests of disruptive forces of radical islam and Russia come together: weaken the West.Managing Director, Center for Transatlantic Relations (CTR), Johns Hopkins UniversityMen who give unsolicited advice about what I should or shouldn\u0027t be saying are sexist chauvinists who just can\u0027t stand that a woman has a voice. To them I say with a smile; too bad.Author of American Woman: The Poll Dance, Media Director for We Are WomanAugustine, possessing the mind of a shrewd political strategist, among other attributes, understood that securing the power of the state to instruct and to coerce was crucial for the Christian Church\u0027s long-term success. Sound familiar?Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghAfter settling multiple law enforcement investigations this month on absurdly favorable terms, troubled for-profit college company Education Management Corp. (EDMC) may be on the verge of getting a sweetheart deal from Congress -- a deal that would compound the harms that the company already has caused to students and taxpayers.Attorney, advocate, writer at RepublicReport.orgTragedies like this illustrate how important it is for everyone to take the one simple step that can prevent serious illness and even death: get a flu shot every year. In addition to protecting yourself, getting vaccinated against the flu helps protect your loved ones, coworkers, and others who cross your path.The more people learn about Clinton, like the fact her campaign was funded by prison lobbyists and used race as tool against Obama in 2008, the greater the likelihood of Sanders running away with the Democratic nomination.Columnist published in The Cleveland Plain Dealer, The Baltimore Sun, The Hill, Salon, The Jerusalem Post www.hagoodman.comThese are the top 12 countries that are well-known to cater to the solo traveler -- due to their safety, popularity among other solo travelers, and overall guaranteed to give you the time of your life.Travel + lifestyle photojournalist and founder of projectinspo.comIslam is the site of an ideological battle that is at least as critical as the military one, an ideological battle that Christians, Jews and atheists are simply not in a position to wage. So, yes, imams, intellectuals, and ordinary observant Muslims must rise in great number and say to the Islamists, \"Not in our name!\"Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.If we insist on requiring Muslims to disavow Islamist violence, it\u0027s fair also to ask conservative Americans to be honest and self-critical about the connections between our country\u0027s poisonous environment and domestic extremist violence.Author, \u0027Home Free: An American Road Trip\u0027In the aftermath of the recent shooting at Planned Parenthood in Colorado Springs, it\u0027s time we examine the role of words in our politics and in our society. Those who defensively insist that their vicious verbal attacks on Planned Parenthood have nothing to do with a single gunman\u0027s massacre of innocent citizens are fooling themselves.Best-selling author, speaker, and human relations expert.As the most reliable Democratic voters in the past two presidential elections, Black women are an essential part of the winning coalition that any Democratic candidate will need to win in 2016. The urgency that Chisholm felt in 1970 resonates strongly today. But so, too, does her optimism for a better future.Scholar, Center for American Women and Politics, Eagleton Institute of Politics; assistant professor of political science, Rutgers University–CamdenCo-founder and managing director, Higher Heights Leadership FundWith the backdrop of Art Basel, Florida International University and the Creative Class Group will host an exclusive forum with international cultural icons about how to keep artists and creators in the heart of our cities, on Thursday, December 3rd from 3:00 to 5:00 p.m. at the Miami Beach Urban Studios.CEO, The Creative Class Group \u0026 Best-Selling Author, UpgradeGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
