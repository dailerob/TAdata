{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Author of Don\u0027t Think of an Elephant! | UC Berkeley Professor of Linguistics | Founder of Reframe AmericaDonald Trump is winning Republican presidential primaries at such a great rate that he seems likely to become the next Republican presidential nominee and perhaps the next president. Democrats have little understanding of why he is winning -- and winning handily; and even many Republicans don\u0027t see him as a Republican and are trying to stop him, but don\u0027t know how. There are various theories: People are angry and he speaks to their anger. People don\u0027t think much of Congress and want a non-politician. Both may be true. The Democratic Party has not been taking seriously many of the reasons for Trump\u0027s support and the range of that support. And the media has not been discussing many of the reasons for Trump\u0027s support. That needs to change.Both Romney and Rubio are tied to for-profit colleges that fleeced not just many U.S. students, leaving them with substandard educations and overwhelming debt, but also ripped off U.S. taxpayers, who foot the bill for student Pell grants and defaulted student loans.Attorney, advocate, writer at RepublicReport.orgIf the government has its way, then it will have won the authority to turn American tech companies against their customers and, in the process, undercut decades of advances in our security and privacy.Ford Foundation Fellow, ACLU’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology ProjectOn Saturday I went to Anaheim armed with a pen, iPhone and index cards to conduct research on hate groups. The California Realm of the North Carolina-based Loyal White Knights Klan (LWK) group was supposed to come to a park for an \"informational walk.\" As soon as the LWK arrived, the street adjoining the park turned into a violent maelstrom of knives, wooden planks, metal rods, fists, feet and blood.Director, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State UniversityNot a day goes by, it seems, without the mainstream media bashing Bernie Sanders\u0027s economic plan -- quoting certain economists as saying his numbers don\u0027t add up.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027On Christmas Eve in 2011, Hillary Clinton and her closest aides celebrated a $29.4 billion sale of over 80 F-15 fighter jets, manufactured by U.S.-based Boeing Corporation, to Saudi Arabia. In a chain of enthusiastic emails, an aide exclaimed that it was \"not a bad Christmas present.\"Co-founder, CODEPINK: Women for PeaceAny first-year public policy student who submitted this as their health care plan would be kicked out of school, if not deported.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThe best part? This is already a program authorized under a statute by Congress. Expanding this program doesn\u0027t require an executive order.The president can just do it.Attorney, officer in the U.S. Air Force ReserveLet me start by saying that I get it. I get the frustration. I, too, am concerned about where our country is headed. I want to see our nation great again. Why wouldn\u0027t we want an accomplished businessman to run the \"business\" of the states? But this is not about Donald Trump. No, this is about you.Author and blogger at HonestlyThinking.orgIn filling the Supreme Court vacancy, Senate Republicans seem to be afraid of, well, everything.National Director, NCAPA; Advocate for justice, equality, and the Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander communityTrump\u0027s pledge to murder the civilian relatives of terrorists could be considered quite modest -- and, in its bluntness, refreshingly candid -- when compared to President Obama\u0027s ongoing policy of loosing drones and U.S. Special Operations forces in the Greater Middle East.Writer; Senior Advisor, National Priorities ProjectThe integration of refugees is a mighty challenge for the coming years. From the pleasant slogan \"We can do it\" we must change to \"We will do this.\" We have to create the preconditions now so that we can complete the task.Vice-Chancellor, Economics and Energy Minister of Germany.The middle classes cannot see a future. It may not be as severe as in America, but inequality is rising in France.Editorial Director, Le Huffington PostMaybe Justice Thomas\u0027 silence had no meaning other than that he did not think of a question that would have been useful. Maybe the question he asked now was the first one that he thought of as useful and that nobody else asked. For us, it should not matter.Arthur Larson Professor at Duke UniversityI had the privilege and opportunity to ask President Obama about what he considers some of his top accomplishments in protecting wildlife, and this interview represents one of the fullest expressions of his views that\u0027s been published anywhere on his wildlife protection ethic.President and CEO, The Humane Society of the United StatesCongratulations Republican Party, you got what you wanted. You finally nominated your dream candidate: a fascist corporate psychopath who says what every hate-mongering white supremacist wants to hear.Engineer, woodworker, community activist. Black Lives Matter.I wish to support Senator Warren\u0027s encouragement of the scientific community to pursue marijuana as treatment for pain and as a means to reduce the tragic increases in deaths by opiate overdose.Author, \u0027Fietlebaum\u0027s Escape\u0027Today\u0027s topics include: Super Tuesday is Super; We Kind of Know the Outcome; John Oliver\u0027s Mole Joke; Samantha Bee Should Host the Daily Show; Marco Rubio Attacks Trump\u0027s Penis; Trump Lies About His Hands and the KKK; and much more.Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez Show, Writer for Salon.comToday, XPRIZE and Google announce a new digital documentary series from Academy Award-nominated director Orlando von Einsiedel, Executive Producer J.J. Abrams, Bad Robot, and Epic Digital.Making the Impossible PossibleHe said, \"From mourning to dancing.\" I exhaled and even managed a slight smile, \"That will be you.\" Roy corrected me and added, \"No, eventually, with time, it will be you.\"WriterToday we think of democracy as a wonderful form of government. Citizens all across the land enjoy the power to vote and elect their own leaders. Back when this nation was founded, however, our founding fathers did not think this was such a hot idea.Writer and commentator in New York CityYou know a bail bondsman before you know how to drive. You\u0027ve been in waiting rooms for visits and releases. You know about barriers, tangible and translucent? -- ?a hell on both sides of the glass. You know what not to talk about, what will never be talked about, what needs to be talked about.Writer based in PhiladelphiaI am an unapologetic liberal, and in may respects, I suppose I am a Democratic Socialist. But I support Hillary Clinton rather than Bernie Sanders because she gets my issues -- and he does not. You see, in addition to being a lifelong liberal, I am also a disabled woman.Proud disabled woman, attorney, disability law and policy expert, and PhD studentIn our proudest moments, New Yorkers have set the standard for all Americans to follow. The vote before our state Senate is another occasion for New Yorkers to come together, prove the doubters wrong and demand a better life for ourselves and our families.CEO, Bend the Arc: A Jewish Partnership for JusticeSupporter, Bend the ArcAre we witnessing the end of the Republican Party?
