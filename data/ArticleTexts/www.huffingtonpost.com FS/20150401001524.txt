{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressWashington bureau chief for The Huffington PostThe assurance of fair, non-discriminatory business practices is, as it turns out, pretty essential in a competitive marketplace. And when you take away that assurance, you imperil your ability to compete. Just as an openly discriminatory florist opens itself up to the risk that not enough people will want to continue doing business with it to maintain that business, so too does an openly discriminatory state endanger its ability to maintain itself economically. Those are the consequences. And consequences have nothing to do with tolerance. All the states that Indiana competes with for economic benefactors will happily tolerate Indiana\u0027s law all the way to the bank. Anyone who tells you that \"tolerance\" is supposed to provide everyone with the means of living a consequence-free existence has badly lost the thread.In the wake of the financial crisis, President Obama took the helm of a sinking economic ship and help to right it. The unemployment rate is now once again at pre-recession levels -- the lowest in seven years (5.5 percent).Singer; Actress; Director; Composer; ActivistGregg Jacobs is an insomnia specialist at the Sleep Disorders Center at the UMass Memorial Medical Center and the author of Say Good Night to Insomnia. In answer to my questions, he shared his insights on how human sleep patterns have changed over time, healthier and more effective alternatives to sleeping pills, and how to reverse our worst sleep habits and behaviors.If there\u0027s an upside to Gov. Mike Pence signing the pro-discrimination SB101 \"Religious Freedom Restoration Act\" into law last week, it\u0027s this: the bigots, homophobes and neo-segregationists have been coaxed out of the woodwork, exposing themselves for what they really believe.Managing Editor, The Daily Banter, host, \u0027The Bob \u0026 Chez Show\u0027The 2015 election is the first time in Nigeria\u0027s 54-year history that an incumbent president was voted out of office.Nigerian American journalist; Co-Founder, CompareAfrique.comConsider the rise of both the working poor and the non-working rich, and the meritocratic ideal on which America\u0027s growing inequality is often justified doesn\u0027t hold up.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027For far-right activists and legislators concerned about marriage equality and other LGBT rights, Hobby Lobby provided the perfect opportunity: Pass state Religious Freedom Restoration Acts and effectively grant a religious-exemption claim from LGBT anti-discrimination laws, based on the Supreme Court\u0027s rewriting of the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993.Senior Fellow, People For the American Way and People For the American Way FoundationWhat can we do to revitalize the smaller cities and towns in America, and give Americans a choice about what type of place they can call home? This is not the first time in American history we have had a problem with parts of the country being left behind. We should revisit some of the policies that worked before.Associate Professor of Law at George Washington University School of Law in Washington, D.C.It\u0027s a huge misgiving to solely place blame on \"suicidal tendencies\" during horrendous events like the Germanwings crash, because it conflates suicide with the intention to hurt other people.Healthy Living Editor, The Huffington PostOver the five years that I was incarcerated, I felt confused and often dehumanized. After dropping out of my gang, life became a daily struggle to survive. In no way was my incarceration an environment of rehabilitation. In fact, some even called our facility \"gladiator school,\" because of the harsh treatments we faced daily.Member of the Board of the Anti-Recidivism CoalitionWhen I visited the Sivile Primary School in South Africa\u0027s Western Cape, I was struck by a feeling. It was a feeling of the vulnerability of the children all around me, who are put at huge risk every single day.Author, global advocate and South African campaigner on road safety and cancerThe threats emanating from Yemen are distorted and exaggerated, the stakes are actually relatively low (except for Yemenis), any imposed settlement is highly elusive and the costs to those engaged may be high. For the U.S., it can be once again something of a lose-lose situation where the enemy of my enemy is often also my enemy.Former vice chairman, CIA’s National Intelligence CouncilWhen it was over and he was snoring loudly on the couch while I lay shivering on the floor, the last thing I thought was sexual assault.English Literature student studying in the UK. Seattleite. Enjoys Mel Brooks movies, books, New Balance shoes, beanies, and Nutella. But not Nutella-covered beanies. Contact at rachelle.l.menn@gmail.comIn light of the stark contrast between the East and West Coasts, would it surprise anyone if Californians called on Jim Inhofe to throw some of his snowballs in their direction?Energy, Environmental Blogger, getenergysmartnow.comOn the day he would have turned 88, members of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors will enter an epic battle by farm workers seeking implementation of their union contract against a giant Central Valley grower -- reminiscent of 1960s farm labor fights.President, United Farm WorkersBy allowing the pursuit of money to guide our educational practices, we have miseducated everyone. But there is an alternative. Some of the most intractable problems in schools could be solved if we replaced money with a different goal, one that would be good for all children, both now and in their futures -- the goal of well-being.Senior lecturer in psychology and founding director of the program in teaching, Williams CollegeBy its very nature as an all-purpose telescope, in most cases Hubble helped cement existing suggestions, rather than making singular discoveries. Nevertheless, in all the topics listed below, Hubble\u0027s contribution has been crucial.Astrophysicist, Space Telescope Science InstituteDo we want our kids exposing their vulnerabilities on Instagram, Facebook or Snapchat? Do we want them to think a screen is the correct receptacle for their heartbreaks or triumphs? Do we want our children to spend more time tagging their experiences than actually experiencing them?megconley.com, speaker, bacon eaterIn the Arkansas of my growing up, not only was smart good, but the prevailing philosophy was always to do the right thing, to show other people dignity, and to honor the common man. I\u0027m sad to say that those days are gone. In today\u0027s Arkansas, we can\u0027t recognize a lie when it\u0027s spoon-fed to us, and we don\u0027t want to help anyone who isn\u0027t as white-bread as we are.Author and Entrepreneur, an Exile Returned From ParisThey\u0027ve cheated customers and defrauded investors. Now they want to use our legalized system of campaign-cash corruption to protect themselves from the very government that rescued them.Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host/Managing Editor, The Zero HourIn observance of Women\u0027s History Month, there is much progress to mark for women and HIV/AIDS in America since the emergence of the epidemic three decades ago.Public Health Editor, The Huffington Post; Former U.S. Assistant Surgeon GeneralThis week before Easter gives me cause to pause and reflect. Haven\u0027t men always failed to trust women, because somehow there is an innate belief that women are less trustworthy? But I\u0027m reminded on Easter that Jesus did. And it tells me that somehow, when it comes to bearing witness to Him, He trusts me too.Wife, writer-mama, speakerThe Indiana Religious Freedom Restoration Act, signed by Governor Mike Pence last week, is one of the most biased pieces of state legislation we\u0027ve seen in our modern era. The fact that it is cloaked in the name of religious freedom is particularly offensive to me as a member of the clergy who has been engaged in ministry and social justice work my entire life.President, National Action NetworkMuch of the opposition to Mars exploration is based on disinformation and distraction tactics that imply or even claim outright that Mars would bust the budget or endanger Social Security, which, given actual budgetary facts and context, is preposterous.CEO, Explore MarsDirector of Political Outreach for Explore Mars.Every year, of the at least 122,600 undocumented seniors in the country\u0027s high schools, only around 2,000 are expected to graduate with a college degree.Senior Policy Analyst for Generation Progress, Center for American ProgressI would not be here today if it wasn\u0027t for the free, quality health care I was given in the form of Medicaid. I support the ACA and I advocate for a single payer national health insurance system. This is what we all need in order to be a society in which our ideals are realized rather than sold off.

Writes about issues pertaining to politics, social justice, healthcare, and income inequality.World leaders are close to an historic agreement that would roll back and contain Iran\u0027s nuclear program. In order for the deal to succeed, however, it must deliver on three core issues.President, Ploughshares Fund; Author, \u0027Nuclear Nightmares: Securing the World Before It Is Too Late\u0027It was exactly a year ago when I allowed myself to be fully seen by the world as the woman that I am: a proud transgender female. For a long time, I was paralyzed by fear in accepting my truth. I finally decided that I could not be paralyzed anymore. I realized that to accept vulnerability is to allow your authenticity to shine.Model, Transgender activistRegardless of how you define it, we can agree that these familial connections exist in today\u0027s politics -- a 2016 presidential race between Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush is very possible. How do you start building your political dynasty? Unfortunately, someone has to do the hard work and pave the road to a political office.Freshman, Yale UniversityThe advantage of the notorious cover of Der Spiegel that showed Angela Merkel in front of the Acropolis surrounded by Nazi officers is that it finally poses, in a way that cannot be dodged, the question of Germanophobia in Europe.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.While we support a constitutional amendment to restore the authority of Congress, state and local governments to regulate campaign spending, it\u0027s a long-term fight.
