{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, The American ProspectYou have to hand it to Standard and Poor\u0027s. Forget their two-trillion dollar math error. The whole idea that these people are evaluating the creditworthiness of the United States is just loony. These are the same people who brought us the crisis, by blessing junk sub-prime loans as AAA securities. And they did so because they were paid as consultants by the same financial scoundrels who created the securities.

As Mubarak shot protestors, Gaddafi bombed cities, and Assad flattened his people with tanks, Israel\u0027s protests have for the most part been missing.Read Post | CommentsJudge H. Lee Sarokin, 8/7/11Retired in 1996 after 17 years on the federal benchYes, the deficit must be reduced, waste eliminated, spending curtailed, and entitlements reviewed and probably reduced, but we need a government that operates by compromise not coercion.Read Post | CommentsMohamed el-Erian, 8/6/11CEO and co-CIO, Pacific Investment Management CompanyThere will be endless debate on whether S\u0026P was justified in stripping America of its AAA rating.

Summer does. Not only for all of the stuff that gets emphatically put on hold -- school, serious movies, professional accountability -- but also because it is the season we are terminally in the habit of measuring by how close it is to being over.Read Post | CommentsImam Khalid Latif, 8/7/11Executive Director, NYU Islamic CenterI used to be a Ramadan Muslim and it was the kindness of a couple of people that made me believe I could be more than that.
