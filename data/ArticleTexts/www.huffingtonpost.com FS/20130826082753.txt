{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundAs the nation celebrates the fiftieth anniversary of the March on Washington, many are discussing what Dr. King would say to the nation and world today and tell us to do. But his message to us today is as clear as it was fifty years ago if only we could hear, heed, and follow his warnings about what we need to do to make America America.Comments (517)Eric H. Holder, Jr.Attorney General of the United StatesAs we gather today, 50 years later, their march -- now our march -- goes on. And our focus has broadened to include the cause of women, of Latinos, of Asian Americans, of lesbians, of gays, of people with disabilities and of countless others across this country who still yearn for equality.Comments (293)Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOIf you haven\u0027t already done so, I would strongly suggest that you become familiar with the story of Sara Blakely, the founder of Spanx. Not because she is said to be the youngest self-made female billionaire ever, but because she seems to epitomize the combined power of hard work, persistence, innovation and humility.CommentsMaureen RyanTV critic, The Huffington PostMy jaw dropped when I realized what Walt was doing.Comments (58)Lisa-Jo BakerBlogger at LisaJoBaker.comWhen the car crashes. When you have more long distance charges than you thought possible. When you run out of gas, chocolate chip cookies and faith. I will be there.Comments (12)Jeanne Devon (AKMuckraker)Managing Editor, TheMudflats.netIn the never ending edge-of-your-seat ennui that is Sarah Palin\u0027s future political career, there\u0027s some news from the Last Frontier.Comments (65)Anthony W. OrlandoLecturer in the College of Business and Economics at California State University, Los AngelesThis historical amnesia is a dangerous mistake. It poisons our hearts with pessimism. It blinds us to the lessons and solutions we need. Most New Yorkers have no idea how prevalent poverty used to be -- or how their predecessors made it go away.Comments (20)Seth ShostakSenior Astronomer, SETI InstituteThe \"water found on Mars\" story is as perennial as Christmas. NASA doesn\u0027t need to tell us that again. So why not cut out the seemingly endless stream of robotic middlemen, and just send hardware that will search for life, big or small? Isn\u0027t it time to cut to the chase?Comments (192)Diane RavitchHistorian, NYU professorAcross the nation, our schools are suffering from budget cuts. As more money is allocated to testing and accountability, less money is available for the essential programs and services that all schools should provide. Our priorities are confused.Comments (508)Dr. Michael J. BreusClinical Psychologist; Board Certified Sleep SpecialistGiven the scope of the role that work plays in our lives, we don\u0027t pay nearly enough attention to the impact of our jobs on our health -- and in particular, our sleep.CommentsCT Working Moms25 working moms juggling motherhood and a careerWe play for awhile till it\u0027s dinnertime. Sometimes, I\u0027m just so in awe of how cool she is and how fast she\u0027s growing up that I stare at her like this:Comments (15)Jonathan WeilerDirector of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel HillTo a significant extent, ESPN has always been in la-la land about its ability to do news reporting while it also hocks the products its supposed to be covering evenhandedly. But the NFL concussion story may well prove to be the most serious blow to its self-image yet.CommentsIsabel Foxen DukeCertified health coach and emotional eating expert.And after years of studying, I\u0027ve discovered the fundamental mentalities of \"normal\" eaters that are keeping you from freedom with food. Buckle up.Comments (62)Bob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowEvery publication makes mistakes. Every major publication has, at some point, botched a story. But the way things are going with The Guardian as it publishes this series of Edward Snowden \"bombshells,\" we\u0027re well beyond isolated glitches.Comments (787)Jeff DanzigerPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideComments (24)Steve WiensPastor, writer, runnerBy far the best moment every day was when the kids were finally in bed, and the adults all gathered upstairs to laugh, moan about our sore, aging bodies, and relive every precious part of that day.CommentsDr. Gary TrosclairGary Trosclair, LCSW, DMA, is a certified Jungian analystWe all have many parts to our personalities and getting those parts to work in harmony is the essence of emotional health. Leave out certain voices and you\u0027re in for strikes, rebellions, hypocrisy, and, eventually, brutal attacks.CommentsCindy ZelmanWriter and bloggerI know many out there think being able to get high at a concert without fear of being thrown out is a wonderful thing, but I don\u0027t believe many have considered the issues for those of us who do not want to inhale pot smoke anymore than we want to inhale cigarette smoke.Comments (49)Alice GatebukeRwandan genocide survivorSince the first invasion, more than 5 million people have died in Congo, making it the deadliest conflict since the Second World War. And many of those deaths lie at the hands of the Rwandan government.CommentsClint Lanier and Derek HembreeBucket List BarsTo some it seems a trivial kind of happiness. It\u0027s just a sign after all. But to many, neon bar signs are more: they are in fact works of art, and whole movements exist to document, photograph and preserve these all-too-frequently disappearing bits of America\u0027s past.CommentsMark RubinsteinAuthor, \u0027Mad Dog House \u0026 Love Gone Mad\u0027 (due September 1st) www.markrubinstein-author.comEleanor also makes clear that the past remains alive for each of us. The experiences of childhood and their effects simmer within us at the deepest levels, never to be lost. They can resurface, and retain the capacity to influence us even though we may not recall them.CommentsScott WeingoldCo-founder, College Planning Network LLC / Publisher, CollegeMadeSimple.comYou don\u0027t have to search very far to get tips and strategies for getting college scholarship money these days. But how often do you hear about the seedy underworld of scholarships?CommentsTani BrownFulbright ETA in VietnamIn my twenties I feel the freedom of this self-actualization. It\u0027s learning how to cook to feed myself. It\u0027s watching the news to form an opinion. I\u0027m developing an enduring philosophy for life, and enjoying the sweetness of solitude. Thank you, Ms. Creasy.CommentsWilliam BradleyPolitical AnalystOne of the oddest aspects of Barack Obama\u0027s presidency is its sometimes quite strange mix of the ultra-politically correct and the anti-politically correct. They\u0027ve led to some of the most crashingly boneheaded things this White House has done.Comments (20)David BrakeFreelance writer, script developerRecently, footage emerged of what Scott had in mind for his mutants. Rather than rely on CGI, Scott -- as seen with Prometheus -- favored the art of make-up, prosthetics and animatronics. It\u0027s some truly stunning work.CommentsBrian KennedyWriter and performerOn a recent Saturday morning, while walking my dog down a quiet, tree-lined street in my Manhattan neighborhood, I heard a loogie being hocked. I thought nothing of it -- until a mixture of saliva and snot landed directly in front of my pooch\u0027s paws.Comments (29)Susan SoutherlandPresident, Just Marry! and National Wedding Expert for Perfect Wedding GuideMy observations have allowed me to identify three mistakes most brides make when planning their weddings. Our job as planners is to stop them when they start heading in the wrong direction and give them the tools they need to avoid the following pitfalls.CommentsTroy CampbellSocial Scientist, Duke UniversityWill Affleck suck or succeed as Batman? That remains uncertain. However, one thing was made certain this week certain: We Americans care who plays Batman.Comments (13)Patricia McGuirePresident, Trinity Washington UniversityPresident Obama\u0027s populist rhetoric bashing colleges on cost and accountability was surely a crowd-pleaser; and there\u0027s just enough truth in his criticism to make his plan seem, at the very least, important if not brilliant. But the plan masks a big lie. Actually, several big lies.Comments (11)Dan WeissAssociate professor of psychology and linguisticsDespite sports being an entertainment industry, being a fan is not about maximizing pleasure. In order to earn the right to celebrate victory, you must experience the agony of defeat.CommentsKelly Rigg, 2013.26.08David Paul, 2013.26.08Zaki Hasan, 2013.26.08Mike Ragogna, 2013.26.08Alex Moaba, 2013.25.08Dan Persons, 2013.25.08Katherine Starr, 2013.25.08Mohamed A.
