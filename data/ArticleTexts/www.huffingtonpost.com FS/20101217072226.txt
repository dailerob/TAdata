{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureYou can\u0027t fault the president for showing a little love to America\u0027s corporate leaders, but there is one small problem here: The entire premise of the meeting is wrong. What is good for General Motors or General Electric or IBM is no longer necessarily good for America. In fact, these executives and their companies are more part of the problem than part of the solution for this country. They\u0027ve been making out like bandits, but Americans are less and less the beneficiaries of their success.Read Post | CommentsJason Linkins, 12.16.2010Orszag brings a lot of government connections to the table at Citigroup. It\u0027s stuff that Citigroup totally wants, and Citi has already come to realize some of the value of what Orszag has in his pocket.Read Post | CommentsRep. Barbara Lee, 12.16.2010Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA) represents the 9th Congressional District of CaliforniaIt is deeply disappointing that after nine years of war, thousands of American casualties, and the inability of the Afghan government to rise above its corruption and incompetence, we are no closer to ending our role in this conflict.Read Post | CommentsMichael Brenner, 12.16.2010Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic RelationsThe casual way that Americans are shredding their liberties is breathtaking. Rights that have been revered as the nation\u0027s spiritual heirloom for 225 years are cast aside like so many disposable keepsakes.Read Post | CommentsArianna Huffington, 12.15.2010When it comes to WikiLeaks, much of media has planted its flag on the wrong side of the secrecy battle. The government\u0027s legitimate need for secrecy is very different from the government\u0027s desire to get away with hiding the truth.Read Post | CommentsMark Joseph, 11.16.2010Producer, author, talk show host and editor of Bullypulpit.comI\u0027m one of the few people who\u0027ve had the good fortune to turn the tables on Larry King by interviewing him and it remains an unforgettable experience.Read Post | CommentsJoseph J. Thorndike, 12.16.2010Director, Tax History Project at Tax Analysts; Visiting Scholar in History, UVAThe estate tax has a vital but prosaic role: it redistributes the tax burden.

Secretary of Labor; Professor at Berkeley; Author, Aftershock: \u0027The Next Economy and America\u0027s Future\u0027Will lower taxes on the rich spur them to create more jobs? Not a chance. Since 1980, Reagan\u0027s supply-siders have said lower taxes on the rich will trickle down to everyone else. Nothing could be further from the truth.Read Post | CommentsLinda Keenan and Janine R. Wedel, 12.16.2010Banks keeping competitors out and price information to themselves are using tactics designed to maximize profits, but there\u0027s nothing free market about those tactics. It\u0027s up to the government to \"free\" the market, but so far it\u0027s failed.Read Post | CommentsDavid Sirota, 12.16.2010Newspaper columnist, radio host (AM760), bestselling authorEmbedded in our tax and budget debates is the bipartisan assumption that the super-rich shouldn\u0027t pay the tax rates they paid during the mid-20th century -- AKA the tax rates that existed when our economy boomed.Read Post | CommentsRoger Hickey, 12.16.2010Co-Director of the Campaign for America\u0027s FutureRepublican hostage-takers got Obama to go along with their tax cuts for the wealthy by threatening to raise taxes on the middle class and blocking modest stimulus funds for our economy. Now they\u0027ve identified their next hostage.Read Post | CommentsJohn Merrow, 12.16.2010Education Correspondent for PBS NewsHour and author of The Influence of TeachersTelevision and video have an undistinguished track record in public education, as either a babysitter or a security measure. But things have changed in recent years.Read Post | CommentsMalou Innocent, 12.16.2010Foreign Policy Analyst at the Cato InstituteThe Afghan War\u0027s current cost-benefit disparity would call for a scale-down. But for now, the United States would rather fixate on pipe dreams and on asserting America\u0027s permanent role in Central Asia.Read Post | CommentsBob Cesca, 12.15.2010Host of the Bob and Elvis ShowThe volume of progressive moping lately has been staggering -- otherwise sane progressives vowing to not vote in 2012 or to somehow conjure up a viable primary challenger is a great way to elect Awful Republican President X.Read Post | CommentsRobert Naiman, 12.16.2010Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicyThe top line of the story the administration is presenting is \"progress.\" But the assessment of 16 U.S. intelligence agencies gives a very different picture, and the public needs to know that in order to have an informed opinion.Read Post | CommentsTony Blair, 12.16.2010Former Prime Minister of BritainThe international development community needs to find new ways to support leaders in Africa to do the right thing.
