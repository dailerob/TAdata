{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editorial Director, AOL Huffington Post Media GroupI am bad at math, even worse at macroeconomics. In other words, I am your standard political reporter. So take this for what it is worth, but I have an idea for how President Obama can solve the nation\u0027s never-ending mortgage foreclosure crisis. He needs to write a lot of letters. Specifically, by my count, 286,572 of them.

However, then the president could stop playing only defense and go on the offense, making clear who has a major job-creation program and who is sabotaging it.Read Post | CommentsTeresa Strasser, 06.14.2011Emmy Award-winning writerBefore I had a baby, moms were invisible to me.
