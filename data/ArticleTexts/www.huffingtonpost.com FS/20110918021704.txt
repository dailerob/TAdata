{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Fashion designerAll my life I have had a love of \"c\" words: cashmere, comfort, city, creativity, champagne. This remains true, although now I find myself gravitating toward words like connect, collaborate and community. I love these words because what I know for sure is that we can\u0027t do it alone. Whatever that \"thing\" is that we feel compelled to do -- that thing that allows purpose to crystallize -- we need each other to truly get it done.Read Post | CommentsMohamed A. El-Erian, 9/17/11CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOThe time has come for the eurozone -- Germany and France in particular, but also Austria, Finland and the Netherlands -- to decide how they would like European integration to evolve; and they need to do so quickly.Read Post | CommentsGigi Levangie Grazer, 9/17/11Author of Rescue Me, Maneater, and The Starter WifeIn the midst of our separation, our family therapist, a cancer survivor in her 60s, who\u0027d been practicing for many years, gave me sage advice, which I was too angry or blind to accept. \"Wait until the kids are launched,\" she told me. \"Who knows? You may even find yourself in love again, with your husband.\"Read Post | Comments (113)James Zogby, 9/17/11President, the Arab American Institute; Author, \"Arab Voices\"The importance of Palestine is known. But what is shocking is the degree to which politics in Washington still fails to fully grasp and/or act on this point. I worry that both Congress and the administration are on a dangerous collision course with Arab public opinion.Read Post | Comments (162)Dan Collins, 9/17/11New York Editor-At-Large of The Huffington PostMike Bloomberg made headlines by warning that the weakness of the U.S. economy could lead to riots. Mentioning the r-word was a critical error. Mayors of large cities should not say \"riot\" unless there is one. Period.Read Post | CommentsJeffrey Sachs, 9/16/11Director of the Earth Institute, Columbia U. Author of \"The Price of Civilization\"With President Obama\u0027s jobs speech on Monday and Speaker Boehner\u0027s jobs speech yesterday, we can put the Democratic and Republican Party economic plans side by side. What is stunning is that neither side offers a serious diagnosis or a solution.Read Post | Comments (699)Lynn Casteel Harper, 9/17/11Ordained Baptist minister and retirement community chaplainThe trouble is that dementia defies linearity in all its forms: the clear answer, the proof text, the incisive definition.Read Post | Comments (73)Joe Peyronnin, 9/17/11NYU Journalism ProfessorWith just thirteen months to go before the 2012 presidential elections, Republicans are more confident than ever that they will defeat President Barack Obama. But the more scrutiny their field of candidates receives, the more people are asking, \"Is this the best they can do?\"Read Post | CommentsLarry Magid, 9/17/11Technology journalistIt\u0027s important to pay attention to the serious problem of cyberbullying, but we need to keep it in perspective. As bad as it is, cyberbullying is not an epidemic and it\u0027s not killing our children.Read Post | Comments (24)Monica Duffy Toft, 9/17/11Director, The Initiative on Religion in International Affairs, Harvard\u0027s Kennedy School of GovernmentWhat the Arab uprisings revealed is that today\u0027s people desire less a unified ideology around a single leader or leadership that touts triumphalism over some form of evil and more a system of sound governance.Read Post | Comments (17)Martina Davis-Correia, 9/16/11Sister of Troy DavisMy son was six weeks old when I first brought him to meet his uncle, Troy Davis. He was scared to hold my tiny baby. It was such a magical moment, because it was like I was giving my brother this gift.Read Post | Comments (291)Hillary Clinton, 9/16/11U.S. Secretary of StateIn the Participation Age, it is vital for economic growth that we pursue strategies to remove barriers that have prevented women from being full participants in the economy.Read Post | Comments (133)Marian Wright Edelman, 9/16/11President, Children\u0027s Defense FundNew data just released by the U.S. Census Bureau reveals 46.2 million poor people in America, the largest number in the last 52 years. This is a national disgrace.Read Post | Comments (319)Yvette Borja, 9/17/11Student, Yale UniversityAt Yale, being encouraged to put cultural identity on display for reasons other than natural impulse, seemed bizarre to me. Who was this show being put on for, exactly?Read Post | Comments (13)Deborah Stambler, 9/17/11Freelance writer; poet\"We all share common goals of wanting to be happy and successful, to have families and dynamic careers. And that\u0027s what the WIE Symposium is about, setting aside our differences and uniting behind our common aspirations.\"Read Post | CommentsBarbara Hannah Grufferman, 9/16/11Writer and speaker on women\u0027s issues, author, \"The Best of Everything After 50\"Purists snicker at the idea of taking walk breaks, but they\u0027ll be the ones looking for the orthopedic surgeons.Read Post | CommentsSen. Bernie Sanders, 9/16/11Independent U.S. Senator from VermontIt\u0027s time to lift the veil of secrecy in the oil futures market. The American people have a right to know how much excessive speculation has driven up oil prices and which Wall Street firms are doing it.Read Post | Comments (417)Scott Kahan, M.D., 9/17/11Preventive medicine physician, Johns Hopkins UniversityTo be sure, obesity rates only increased over the past decade, continuing the epidemic rise that has progressed over the past half-century. But hidden underneath the scary statistics is quite a bit of good news.Read Post | CommentsDaphne Eviatar, 9/16/11Senior Associate, Human Rights First’s Law and Security ProgramAs if we didn\u0027t have enough wars already, a battle is now reportedly taking place within the Obama administration over whether the U.S. government has the legal authority to kill low-level suspected terrorist supporters where the U.S. now has troops on the ground.Read Post | Comments (34)Shane Claiborne, 9/16/11Activist and bestselling author, \u0027The Irresistible Revolution\u0027It is this dual conviction that no one is above reproach and that no one is beyond redemption that lies at the heart of our faith. Undoubtedly it\u0027s why the early Christians were characterized by non-violence.Read Post | Comments (54)Paul Slansky, 9/16/11Writer; Contributor to The New YorkerWe don\u0027t need Sarah Palin anymore. After three years of overexposure to her tawdry toxicity, we know her too well, and our remaining schadenfreudal needs will more than be met by the cornucopia of damning nuggets Joe McGinniss has unearthed.Read Post | Comments (415)Leon T. Hadar, 9/16/11Journalist and foreign affairs analystThe notion that Erdogan and the AKP are pursuing a foreign policy based on an Islamist agenda reflects a common fallacy, that ideological principles are the main driving force behind the foreign policy of Turkey.Read Post | Comments (39)Geoffrey R. Stone, 9/17/11Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law at the University of ChicagoToday is Constitution Day. It is a day to reflect, at least for a moment, on the American Constitution and how it has helped to shape our nation over more than two centuries.Read Post | CommentsHoward Kissel, 9/16/11Blogger, Cultural Tourist\"Follies\" is a look backward at an art form that represented innocence at the moment when Vietnam cast its shadow over everything and rendered the very idea of innocence dubious. It is a musical full of ambiguity and irony and an irresistible musical power.Read Post | CommentsElisabeth Braw, 9/16/11Senior Reporter, Metro InternationalThey\u0027ve been talking about it. They\u0027ve been negotiating about it. Some have used violence to achieve it. Now, say Palestinians, they\u0027ll finally become a state. Metro met Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad for an exclusive interview.Read Post | Comments (89)Beth Arnold, 9/16/11Journalist and award-winning writer, living in ParisIn general, I know that going off the Internet cold turkey for four weeks will be a shocking change to my body, mind and lifestyle...
