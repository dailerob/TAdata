{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Michael BrennerSenior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghThe sweeping victory of Narendra Modi\u0027s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has set journalists and commentators searching for themes and motifs. How else to fix readers\u0027 attention on a political phenomenon as multi-layered as that unfolding in the vastness of India without saturating them with masses of largely indigestible information and strange ideas. Unfortunately, the truths are blurred in the process and the election\u0027s implications simplified. The one requisite is that the theme be stated in a bold headline -- hence the preference for \"revolution\" of one kind or another.London has always been a crucible for the development of great ideas, innovations, partnerships and products. If we are to put this creative energy to its best use and to balance competing demands, we must attract the best human capital and ensure that our talent pool is as wide as it possibly can be.Fiona Woolf CBELord Mayor of the City of LondonSpend a minute thinking about the people who helped you get to where you are today--either in your career or life in general. Maybe it was that 8th grade history teacher who showed you pictures of exotic hummingbirds from her summer trip to Asia who made you believe you could travel the world just like her.Annie MaisDirector of Education, Roadtrip NationMy heart goes out to all those grievously impacted by this rampage, the latest in an unnerving series of horrific events. It is, sadly, only a matter of time before the next potentially avoidable tragedy. That means we need our heads and our will, not only our hearts, to do more right now.Lloyd I. Sederer, MDMedical director, New York State Office of Mental HealthFor us to learn anything from this tragedy we have to wrench ourselves away from his manifesto -- it\u0027s not about him anymore. Leave him to his fate in eternity, and wish solace on everyone.David Palumbo-LiuLouise Hewlett Nixon Professor, Stanford UniversityLONDON -- \"The English are not very spiritual people,\" goes the quote, often attributed to George Bernard Shaw, \"so they invented cricket to give them some idea of eternity.\" Having arrived in London for the UK publication of Thrive, I can happily say that, when it comes to matters of the soul, the British have evolved quite a bit since Shaw\u0027s quip.Arianna HuffingtonThe tobacco industry\u0027s shift from rich, developed nations to low- and middle-income countries has been well documented. The fossil fuel companies are similarly expanding their operations in low- and middle-income countries where ensuring the growth of energy supplies is considered more critical than preventing climate catastrophe.Michael T. KlareAuthor and Professor of Peace and World-Security Studies, Hampshire CollegeWe cannot continue to deceive ourselves that we are somehow \u0027post-racial\u0027. It\u0027s going to take courage to be honest about our challenges and create resolutions that can truly move us towards greater equality.Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkObama has been critical of his foreign policy critics of late, suggesting that they had little to propose other than military intervention. As a sometimes critic, I take exception to that charge, as I rarely support \"boots on the ground,\" but do question the Obama administration both for what it is doing and not doing.Richard N. HaassPresident, Council on Foreign RelationsAs the father of a daughter, I wish that all men would take just a moment, today, to look inside, to decide if they are proud of the way they look at women on the street, the way they talk to them in bars, the way they talk about them when they feel the women are just out of earshot.Brian KoppelmanWriter. Director. Host of Grantland Podcast The MomentA professional social profile without a nice head shot photo of you hurts you much more than the lack of one helps you find a job or avoid discrimination. So, don\u0027t skip it.Susan P. JoyceOnline job search expert, Job - Hunt.org writerToday, on Nigerian Children\u0027s Day, the girls will still be held in captivity -- and their horror continues unabated.Gordon BrownFormer Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationPope Francis has shown us a faithful, peaceful approach to the Palestinian/Israeli conflict. All of us can follow his example. We are all Pope Francis now. It is up to all of us.Paul Brandeis RaushenbushExecutive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostI was both one of the few witnesses to the crime scene and a photojournalist. It left me confused and conflicted, and I could not help but wonder whether publishing photos of a tragedy is ever justifiable.Mark BrocherStudent journalist and English major at UCSBEarlier this year, the GOP had a chance to prove that it could fund veterans\u0027 health care as eagerly as it borrowed for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.H. A. GoodmanAuthor and Journalist published in Salon.com, the Jerusalem Post, Chicago Tribune, The Hill\u0027s Congress Blog, and other publications.Important, positive words like \u0027love\u0027 and \u0027games\u0027 got put into a new context for him. I\u0027m convinced those words will become building blocks that will offer him support when the questions became more complicated.Carrie SheinbergFormer U.S. Olympic skier, Ambassador for Athlete AllyGrowing up, there was always art all over the place in their apartment. Julia had no idea where it all came from, except that it was one of her dad\u0027s two big passions. The other was justice for the African American citizens of this great country.Julia Louis-DreyfusBrad HallHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) recently published an orotund statement predicated on a lie, betting that Hispanic Americans are incapable of distinguishing between fact and fiction.Fernando EspuelasPolitical Analyst \u0026 contributor to NPR, The Hill, Univision \u0026 other mediaThe voters, disenchanted with the Congress, have put him in charge. Now the question is whether we\u0027ll see Modi the ideologue or Modi the pragmatist. I believe the latter will prevail, though the former will inevitably make its presence known.Rajan MenonSpitzer Professor of Political Science, Colin Powell School, City College of New York/City University of New York; Non Resident Senior Fellow, The Atlantic CouncilNeighborhoods no longer serve as Americans\u0027 primary social networks or source of friends and advisers. More and more, these aspects of life are becoming part of the workplace; offices have even been called the new neighborhood.Ruth Bettelheim, Ph.D.Psychotherapist; Executive/life coachThe first time I blew the whistle on health insurance companies was during a Senate Commerce Committee hearing in June 2009. Last Wednesday, almost five years later, I appeared before that committee again to give a progress report on how Americans have been benefiting since Congress enacted reforms in 2010 that changed the way insurance companies operate.Wendell PotterAuthor, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgDams are not climate-neutral. Particularly in the tropics, organic matter rotting in their reservoirs emits methane, an aggressive greenhouse gas.Peter BosshardPolicy Director, International RiversHis commanding presence has given Palestine\u0027s Arab Christian community hope and strengthens their resolve to remain rooted to their land and to affirm their role as part of a unified Palestinian people. That may or may not have been on the papal agenda, but it may well be this papal visit\u0027s most significant contribution.James ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027I like Zoe as an actress and as a person that I don\u0027t know. I admire her hutzpah as she defends her right to embody Ms. Simone. However, just because you can doesn\u0027t mean you should.T. Better BaldwinEthical Lobbyist, Creative MercenaryGiven all the heroes and soldiers he played over his half century in film, this year, it\u0027s only fitting that John Wayne\u0027s birthday falls on Memorial Day.John FarrEditor, bestmoviesbyfarr.comOur veterans deserve much, much better. And of course, as far as I\u0027m concerned, a lot more parades.Michael WinshipSenior writer, Moyers \u0026 Company on public TV. Senior writing fellow, Demos.

Now, I want to make sure that it doesn\u0027t fail the next generation of students.Lena ScloveWriter and social justice activistAs each new season greets retailers with a staggering number of shoppers choosing to shop online or via mobile as opposed to visiting stores, every retailer from small local boutiques to global superpowers has tried to keep up with the exploding demand for shopping online.Napoleon PerdisMakeup artistCapable of turning on a sixpence and with flair in abundance, Oscar, 22, is one of an exciting crop of players who helped Brazil lift the Confederations Cup on home soil in 2013.Eight by EightThe magazine the beautiful game deservesJust like opposing torture does not mean one condones terrorism, opposing the death penalty does not mean one condones murder.Mugambi JouetAuthorHenry Miller was a devotee of astrology. He employed astrological imagery in his writing for expressive purposes, and he relied on astrology when faced with important decisions in his personal life.Arthur HoyleAuthor of \u0027The Unknown Henry Miller: A Seeker in Big Sur\u0027The state-led initiative was chugging right along, moving forward without any interference from the feds, when somehow, they decided to leap in.
