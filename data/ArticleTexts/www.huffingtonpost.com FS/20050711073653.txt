{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Denise Applewhite07.10.2005 Arianna HuffingtonComing in the wake of the London bombings, today’s Meet the Press was a lot about resource allocation. Specifically, given the resources at our disposal, are we using them in the best way so as to maximize our safety? The answer is clearly no. And part of the reason this looks unlikely to change is because of the resource allocation decisions of shows like Meet the Press. Tim’s first guest today was Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff. Good guest to have on if you want to talk seriously about, say, our homeland security. But that’s not what Tim wanted. Instead, he decided to allocate a lot of his scarce 60 minutes\u0027 worth of resources to parlor game questions. The one he most favored today was: Do you think there will be another major attack on the United States? He asked it three times. And, of course, everybody basically said yes. But what’s the point of this question? Is anybody going to say no?Later, Chertoff, in discussing homeland security funding, said “everything\u0027s a tradeoff. We don\u0027t want to move money, for example, from ports into rail because then we\u0027re going to have an issue with ports.” Yes, exactly! It’s a tradeoff. One of the reasons we don’t have enough money to protect our ports and our railways is because of the tens of billions of dollars we are spending in Iraq. And that’s the massive trade-off Russert failed to bring up.read whole post | permalink | comments07.11.2005 Adam McKayImmediately after the London bombings I overheard someone say, \"See! That\u0027s why we\u0027re in Iraq!\" It knocked the wind out of me. \"But even the President admits there\u0027s no connection. Powell said it... Al Qaeda hated Iraq and Hussein...\" It doesn\u0027t matter. We\u0027re into animal response territory here. Like when you try and help a scared dog and it bites you. The whole world has become a threat. Things are blurry.read whole post | permalink | comments07.11.2005 Laurie DavidLast week at the G8, President Bush restated his favorite global warming canard: that mandatory curbs on fossil fuel pollution will “cripple the U.S. economy.” WELL, WHAT DOES HE THINK GLOBAL WARMING WILL DO TO THE ECONOMY!?!? I wish there was an even bolder bold on this computer to emphasize how insane this logic is. Non-stop flooding, killer heat waves, energy and food shortages: what will these do to the economy? Will it be good for Wall Street when millions of people are displaced from coastal cities?read whole post | permalink | comments07.10.2005 David SirotaThe right-wing knows that in the absence of Democrats asking serious substantive questions, they can try to turn the horrible tragedy in London into a brazen political opportunity for President Bush, without so much of a peep of criticism, and without anyone asking the substantive national security questions that these attacks raise. Democrats need to start fundamentally challenging this administration on its entire national security strategy - not just nipping around the edges, and not retreating in fear as they have recently.read whole post | permalink | comments07.10.2005 Richard ValerianiNew York Times reporter Judy Miller is in jail for refusing to reveal sources for a story she never wrote. Somewhere, Franz Kafka must be smiling... Karl Rove appears to be the leaker in the case of outed CIA agent Valerie Plame. Reminds me of why I wanted to cover the Pope--so I could one day quote \"an infallible source\"... At the Olympics site vote in Singapore, France was represented by President Chirac, Great Britain by Tony Blair and the United States by Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton. This was the political equivalent of premature ejaculation. Hillary won\u0027t be head of government until 2009.read whole post | permalink | comments07.10.2005 Craig CrawfordIf Karl Rove planned this -- which I doubt -- he really is a genius: 1) He leaks to Time\u0027s Matt Cooper in such a way that he avoids the law\u0027s intent requirement for criminal liability (Newsweek notes that Cooper\u0027s email shows nothing indicating Rove knew or revealed that Valerie Plame was an undercover agent, only that she worked at the CIA). 2) The ensuing grand jury investigation dramatically weakens the news media and future leakers, as reporters must decide whether to testify or go to jail, and even turns Rove\u0027s foes in the public against the reporters involved because they are seen as protecting him. This would give Machiavelli a migraine.read whole post | permalink | comments07.11.2005 Harry ShearerNow comes a story, courtesy of the Asia Times, that would seem to cast a fine, evil backlight on the mushroom cloud alarmism of the pre-Iraq War Administration statements. The report suggets that Saudi Arabia, which reputedly has been trying to go nuclear since 1975 (!!), has purchased nuclear materials from our other close friend, Pakistan (the father of whose bomb, A.Q. Khan, has previously been revealed to have sold nuclear goodies to North Korea, Iran, and Libya, among other good citizens of the world). The report also indicates that said Saud kingdom also paid a certain Middle East figure to develop a nuclear capability--none other than Saddam Hussein.read whole post | permalink | comments07.10.2005 Jane Wells23-year-old Nathan Kleinman is to be applauded. He began a hunger strike on June 30 in Lafayette Park outside the White House to demonstrate his solidarity with the 3.5 million victims of the genocide in Darfur, most of whom are starving. This is a reasoned, rational and immensely brave act by a young man of conscience. Few of us would have the courage to do likewise...read whole post | permalink | comments07.10.2005 Bob DreyfussAstonishingly, the very Iraqi government whose supposed legitimacy the neocons want Americans to support has now made a deal with the neoconservatives’ worst devil, the ayatollahs’ regime in Iraq. The ultimate irony is that the United States is supporting a regime in Baghdad that is drawing strength from a regime next door in Iran that calls America the Great Satan. The silence from the neoconservatives on this paradox is deafening.read whole post | permalink | comments07.11.2005 Deanne StillmanCleveland is the place that says it\u0027s okay to dream, but not really. Which is why I left the joint a long time ago. Natives who have left, and many who are still there, are not surprised that the Plain-Dealer -- one of the worst papers in the country -- has made like the Cleveland Indians in a tie game at the bottom of the 9th with two out and two on and choked. In quashing an important story for fear of legal reprisal, the PD has lost, because most likely the leaked and incriminating documents will pop up on the internet, thus drawing yet more readers away from the misused piece of processed tree bark that passes as the city\u0027s primary information source.read whole post | permalink | comments07.10.2005 Bill ScherRob McKay argued we should support Gonzales in order to split the Republican Party. But a Gonzales nomination would upset social conservatives regardless of what Dems and liberals do. However, if we called attention to the likely motivation for a Gonzales pick -- payback to corporate donors -- that could drive a far deeper wedge in the right-wing coalition. And if Gonzales lacked support on the left and right, the nomination would likely collapse. Bush\u0027s hand would be weakened, and the chance that he would be forced to nominate an impartial judge would increase...read whole post | permalink | comments07.10.2005 Paul LoebWhen someone exhibits as much contempt for democracy as Gonzales does, you have to challenge him. He\u0027s an architect of many of the most destructive Bush policies like the 2002 torture memo. He helped push through the Patriot Act and wrote the Presidential Order saying that terror suspects could be tried and sentenced to death by secret military tribunals. This isn\u0027t someone to embrace, morally or politically.read whole post | permalink | comments07.10.2005 Rep. John ConyersIn the 90’s, there was a media uproar when literally accurate, but misleading, statements were made about a private sexual affair. Today, when such statements are made out a life and death matter -- the decision to go to war -- for a Nixonian purpose -- to smear truth-telling critics -- there is barely a peep from the press corps. In the days since Rove’s role became public, the White House press corps has yet to pose a question to the White House press secretary about it. Not a word about the disgusting hypocrisy of an Administration that came to office promising to “change the tone” in Washington now attacking a critic through his spouse.read whole post | permalink | comments07.10.2005 Kenneth LererWhen Rove says he can\u0027t be quoted, he\u0027s not quoted. Period. He knows what he says will never ever come back to haunt him. Talk to the reporter. Say what he wants to. Move on to the next call. It\u0027s like talking to your psychiatrist or rabbi/priest: It\u0027s a private conversation never to be repeated. But now imagine if some of the things you said to your psychiatrist, rabbi/priest all of a sudden were to become public. Shit. Now you understand Rove\u0027s problem.read whole post | permalink | commentsAFP/Brendan SmialowskiAP/Asaad MuhsinAPCP/Adam DombowskyAP/Courtesy of Steve Haddock, HOAFP/FileHuff Post values your privacy.
