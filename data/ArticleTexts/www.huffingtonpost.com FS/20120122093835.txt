{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, Rick Perry closed out his presidential run while Newt Gingrich\u0027s second ex-wife claimed he\u0027d wanted an open marriage -- and President Obama brought down the house at the Apollo by revealing his heretofore hidden inner-Al Green. Meanwhile, Mitt Romney, unable to counter the hardening narrative that he\u0027s a tone deaf, out of touch mega-millionaire, didn\u0027t help matters with his response to being asked about his tax returns. When you are being booed for lack of financial transparency by a GOP debate crowd, odds are you\u0027ve probably royally screwed up. It\u0027s never a good idea -- and especially not this year -- to be seen as completely out of touch with the economic concerns of ordinary Americans.
