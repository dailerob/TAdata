{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week, the time devoted to giving thanks for all that we have became a little shorter, and the time devoted to accumulating more stuff grew longer, with the shopping orgy known as Black Friday (a name that seems more apt every year) getting started on Thanksgiving itself. At Macy\u0027s, the traditional parade balloons were followed by armed police watching as impatient shoppers, corralled within barricades, waited to get into the company\u0027s flagship store. Black Friday brought a slew of bargains coast to coast -- along with shootings, stabbings, various assaults and the trending hashtag #WalmartFights. How did a holiday meant to celebrate what\u0027s best in us come to be hijacked by a consumerist frenzy that increasingly showcases our worst impulses? Perhaps next year, between Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we can officially shoehorn in Reflection Sunday.Comments (40)Alicia KeysSinger, songwriter, AIDS activist, philanthropistTo borrow and reimagine the words of President Kennedy: We choose to end AIDS. We choose to provide access to treatment to everyone in the world living with HIV by the end of this decade, not because it is easy, but because it is hard. This is our moon shot.Comments (19)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027The debate about immigration reform has been very productive in America over these past several years. There is no real substance behind the opposition. Rather it is politics: angry politics, fearful politics, and, sadly, racially-based politics, with institutional political practices and rules that can avoid democratic accountability.Comments (188)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarParents have nosed around in their kids\u0027 lives ever since the invention of the telephone, but these days, technology has taken the spying game to an entirely new level with multiple points of entry, from Facebook and Twitter to Instagram, Vine, and Tumblr.Comments (141)Desmond Tutu1984 Nobel Peace Prize winnerWe\u0027ve come so far since the days of unnecessary dying, even without yours truly as a doctor. We don\u0027t need to fear diseases like HIV, malaria or TB as death sentences anymore, but challenges we have the power to overcome.CommentsArianna HuffingtonFinancial Education is rooted in the belief that by empowering ourselves to take control of our own financial lives, we can reduce the stress that so often accompanies financial decisions and at the same time improve the parts of our lives that are about so much more than money.Comments (88)Kevin BaconActorSixDegrees.org has teamed up with the Case Foundation, the Network for Good and CrowdRise to celebrate #GivingTuesday with a call to kick off the holiday season by fundraising for your favorite charity.

Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkDiversity is one of the greatest strengths of this nation, and we must respect one another in a way that preserves and further develops this diversity.

Silence is akin to tacit acceptance.Comments (212)George LakoffAuthor, \u0027The Political Mind,\u0027 \u0027Moral Politics\u0027 and \u0027Don\u0027t Think of an Elephant!\u0027The NY Times has many virtues and some important flaws. Both were evident on the paper\u0027s front page this week and there is a lot to be learned by what did and did not appear there.Comments (443)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundWhile many American families gather around the Thanksgiving table this week, some of us combining this year\u0027s traditional dinners with Hanukkah feasts, the nearly 49 million Americans living in food insecure households will be struggling to afford the food they need.Comments (246)Rachelle FriedmanBlogger; speaker; ambassador for the spinal cord injury communityIf you\u0027ve said any of these, don\u0027t feel bad (unless you\u0027ve stolen a handicap parking spot!).

I had read it before but, this time, almost instantly, in a wave of emotions and realizations and revelations and a wide variety of indescribable sensations, I became a Christian. It happened.Comments (1,290)Olivia ColePoet, author, and activistThe good guys are white, we have learned, after eons of our faces being plastered under cowboy hats and in impeccable Bond suits. White men are Superman, we have learned. Bad men, we have learned, are black.
