{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"As the years have gone by, my memories of 9/11 have come to focus less on the bewilderment, the fear, the horror, and the outrage that dominated that dark day, and far more on what happened the day after the attacks. So as we commemorate 9/11, we should remember that this is also the 10th anniversary of 9/12 -- the day when the shock began to wear off, the full dimensions of the tragedy began to become clear, and the country began to decide what its reaction was going to be. On September 12th, we resolved not to remain sitting stunned in front of our TV screens, but to get out and do something for our nation. On that day, people were driven to connect -- to the country, to their communities, to their friends and families. It was the best of times amidst the worst of times.Read Post | Comments (142)Robert Kuttner, 9/11/11Co-founder and co-editor, The American ProspectSuppose President Obama\u0027s jobs speech marks a turning point.
