{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor of Journalism, Northeastern University, BostonIf the first Democratic primary debate of the 2016 cycle showed us anything, it is the value of experience -- experience in politics, certainly, but also experience in the art of political communication. Hillary Clinton won the debate hands down, with a performance so disciplined and effective that it should serve as a model for future candidates who are about to enter this rarefied arena. By understanding her mission, internalizing her message, and striking an appropriately commanding tone, Clinton ran circles around her opponents.It would be foolish to think that because Hillary Clinton had once supported the TPP in principle, she should remain committed to it unconditionally. Furthermore, Clinton\u0027s longer record shows an increasing reluctance to support the free trade agenda that characterized her husband\u0027s administration twenty years ago.Associate Professor of Law, Yale Law SchoolThis week, I sent a letter to Donald Trump\u0027s campaign asking to not use my music at political rallies. My intent was not to make a political statement, but to make one about the rights of my fellow music creators. Now is the time to show us some love by supporting the effort to reform outdated copyright laws.Singer-songwriter and frontman of AerosmithThe Select Committee has become the longest and one of the least active congressional investigations in history. It has held only three hearings in more than sixteen months. It has spent approximately 4.7 million taxpayer dollars.Dean of the US House of Representatives | Ranking Member, House Judiciary CommitteeThe candidates are not only right to bring up the big-money takeover of our democracy -- they\u0027re smart to do so. Polling consistently shows that this is a top issue for voters and that Americans are looking for leaders who will fight for reform.Executive Vice President for Policy and Program, People For the American Way \u0026 People For the American Way FoundationYesterday, Playboy decided it will no longer publish nude photos. For me, as a model who spent 10 years in the world of glamour, this is a sad day. It\u0027s a sad day because doing nude photos for me was a choice, and one that I am still incredibly proud of.Sports presenter and former glamour modelMadeline Albright once said that \"there\u0027s a special place in hell reserved for women who don\u0027t support other women.\" I believe that there\u0027s a special place in history for women who do, and that is what the Iron Sisters Campaign is all about.Founder and CEO, TheranosIn a world so divided by mounting political tensions and a vicious cycle of violence, we need the United Nations more than ever, and can no longer arrogantly push it aside for partisan interests. The consequences of trying to do so will eventually affect us all.Former President, East Timor, 1996 Nobel Peace Prize laureateCriticism of Russia\u0027s projection of force into Syria is often laced with predictions of an impending Russian quagmire, in the fashion of the Soviet misadventure of the 1970s in Afghanistan. Nothing could be farther from the truth.Adjunct Professor PolSci-Norwich University; Fellow-Foreign Policy Assoc.We\u0027ve been through months of a GOP primary campaign that has dumbfounded the nation for it\u0027s entertaining craziness. The big takeaway from the Dem debate is that none of the candidates are crazy, that it\u0027s possible to listen as well as talk, and that American politics thrive on ideas. Boy, we needed that reminder.Senior Fellow, DemosRemember the NRA\u0027s favorite slogan? The one that goes, \"Gun don\u0027t kill people, people kill people?\" Well a jury in Milwaukee decided that it was the gun, in this case a gun sold to one jerk who actually bought it for another jerk who then pulled it out and shot two Milwaukee cops back in 2009.Mike the Gun GuyMitchell and Jessen conducted unethical research in an attempt to test the purported safety and effectiveness of their tactics. Engaging in torture-related experiments on human beings violates the absolute prohibition against torture and ill-treatment in both domestic and international law.Executive Director, Physicians for Human Rights (PHR)Fundamentalism is a problem regardless of the religion to which it pertains, since it brings with it a highly conservative mentality that only benefits a few. Gateway fundamentalism is the slow and steady encroachment of religion through once-secular government and democratic processes.Author, American Monsters and upcoming Crime RaveSuch a litany disserves the effort to truly assess this complex woman. For she is neither the feminist icon of her fiercest devotees, nor the stock villain of the GOP\u0027s demented melodrama.Novelist and contributing opinion writerThe debate highlighted just how important it is to pressure candidates to focus on the issues progressives care about. That was evident when Hillary Clinton, in her opening remarks, was the only candidate to focus on the battles ahead over full equality for LGBT people.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostThere\u0027s plenty of evidence that paid family leave is not a \"job killer.\" Rather than simply repeat what Fiorina said, a responsible journalist who had done her fact-checking homework would have pointed out that Fiorina was lying -- or at least misinformed.E.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeExecutive Director, In the Public InterestThe things girls most need in order to thrive in this or any country are not complicated or prohibitively costly. Our leaders should take time out from their litanies of poll-tested platitudes to listen hard to the voices of our own Monicas, Maladevis and other girls, who will be honored to show them the way.Executive Director of WomenStrong International \u0026 Director, Millennium Cities InitiativeIn the hell of bad solutions on offer for Syria, some are worse than others. And the one devised by Russian President Vladimir Putin is probably the most infernal of all.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.When President Obama announced his Precision Medicine Initiative, it was a new concept to many, but not to those of us involved in metastatic breast cancer research. To us, the call was a signal of a new commitment with the potential to advance the progress that has been made.Chief Mission Officer of the Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF)Obama should consent to a full, independent, impartial investigation of the hospital bombing by IHFFC. If that investigation shows that war crimes probably occurred, appropriate prosecutions of the U.S. chain of command should ensue.Professor, Thomas Jefferson School of LawI celebrate the success, resilience, brilliance and hard work ethic of the Asian American community, while acknowledging that we have a long way to go before racial justice is achieved for ourselves and everyone else. So let\u0027s continue doing what we\u0027ve always done?--?working hard and knocking down walls.Writer and creative producer based in New York CityI sink down to the floor outside his bedroom and tears stream down my face. His door is closed but every scream from his little lungs rips through my being, echoing in my ears, permeating my soul.Wife to a firefighter/EMT, mother to one baby boy, lover of dogs, donuts and Jesus\"I\u0027m getting people to experience faith, experience hope, experience what it means to be alive and human and thriving and yearning for something that\u0027s beyond yourself -- and seeing that there\u0027s a common bond that we all share in that yearning.\"Writer/InterviewerVice President Joe Biden is either playing coy with his intentions, or is genuinely torn about whether he wants to run in the 2016 election. But after a good showing for all of the Democratic candidates in the first debate, the party demonstrated they don\u0027t need Biden to rescue them.Political science professor, LaGrange College in GeorgiaBy appealing to her womanhood, Clinton has undermined the very essence of feminism. She is actively attributing her uniqueness to her gender and not her merit. This is not to say that her being a woman running for president again is anything short of historic. But why not let that speak for itself?Recent GraduateWhile Francis was visiting America, certain American bishops --when they were not busy embracing the Pope-- were preparing an attack on Francis that they would never have dreamed of launching against Pope John Paul II or Pope Benedict XVI.Professor of History of Christianity, University of St. ThomasThat kind of memorable sound bite (a short remark excerpted from a speech) was what every candidate on the stage, Tuesday, set out to deliver.Mona Kosar Abdi is a freelance writer and a reporter for the local ABC affiliate in Central Virginia.In years past, candidates either totally ignored the failed war on drugs and the harms of marijuana prohibition -- or more typically, said harmful, stupid stuff about their \"youthful indiscretions,\" their concern about \"sending the wrong message,\" and their plans to amp up law enforcement.Director of Media Relations, Drug Policy AllianceYou could point to lots of problems that Proposition 215 created. The problem that has been most troublesome, in my opinion, is the ease with which anyone with $30 can get a letter of recommendation that lets them purchase medical marijuana in California.Doctor, AuthorThe bombing in Ankara shows that ISIS is a major threat not just in the ever-tense southeastern cities, but even now in the very capital of the country. And yet in the pro-government media, there is an ideological insistence on seeing ISIS as a transient phenomenon -- not as an actor in itself but as a \"pawn\" of a giant Western conspiracy aimed at destabilizing the region and weakening Turkey.Turkish journalist; Author, \u0027Islam without Extremes: A Muslim Case for Liberty\u0027Bernie Sanders is no Barack Obama, and smarter minds than mine will crunch these numbers, weigh them, and make their predictions. But as it stands tonight, a few hours out from the debate, Bernie Sanders is the man to beat--at least on the internet.Columnist, Law StudentGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
