{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Lisa BelkinSenior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, The Huffington PostIt’s always tough to be a struggling young mother. This week it’s been particularly hard. First the federal government shutdown halted the WIC program, leaving 9 million mothers and infants without vital nutrition assistance. Then NIH turned away dozens of children who were scheduled to begin experimental cancer treatments, also because of the shutdown. And finally there was the news that Miriam Carey, the woman who was killed while leading police on a chase between the White House and the Capitol yesterday had been suffering from postpartum depression. The events are all examples of what should be the fundamental responsibility of society -- supporting and protecting its most fragile citizens -- and how we are failing miserably at the job.Comments (151)Esther PerelPsychologistAt the heart of sustaining desire lies a challenge. It demands that we learn to reconcile our fundamental need for safety and security with our equally strong need for adventure and novelty.Comments (121)Kirk DouglasActorWhen you get to be 96 years of age the road ahead is short, so you look back at the road you have traveled for almost 100 years. The first thing you come up against is technology.Comments (290)Norman LearFounder, People for the American WayI\u0027m a WWII veteran myself. I like that the men and women who served alongside me can visit the monument in their honor. But maybe a better tribute from our Tea Party politicians would be to step away from the cameras and end this shutdown that they themselves created.Comments (495)Arianna HuffingtonEverywhere we look, we see leaders with high IQs making terrible decisions -- government shutdown, anyone? -- burned out and unable to tap into their own wisdom. That\u0027s why I\u0027m here in Johannesburg to join a conversation among a group of 1,300 young leaders from all over the world who are every day solving problems in their communities.Comments (164)Claire FallonDeputy Blog Editor, The Huffington PostMany male protagonists seem palatable enough at first glance -- unless we hold them to the more exacting friendship standard.Comments (30)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorUnfortunately, curbing the worst excesses of an out-of-control military industrial complex is not a front burner issue for the 40 or so Tea Party Republicans currently stomping their feet in Congress about health care reform.Comments (24)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundThis week there is some good news from D.C. in the midst of all the dismal Congressional news on the shutdown. Over the last several years, D.C. has made a series of decisions that have made the city a model of best practices for its youngest children.CommentsWilliam BradleyPolitical AnalystAmerica is being judged by what\u0027s going on in the Washington clown show. The right-wing faction behind it is like the proverbial barking dog that catches the car -- no idea what to do now. And almost certainly no real grasp of the trouble it\u0027s causing.Comments (28)Caitlin FischWriter and personal chef2. You know the difference right away between his hurt cry and all the other ones, and only respond immediately to the former.Comments (31)Cecile RichardsPresident of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, \u0026 Planned Parenthood VotesThrough her historic, 11-hour filibuster, State Senator Wendy Davis gave a voice to the millions of people who have felt shut out of the political process. The fact is, women in Texas are suffering. Texas women deserve better -- and Texas can do better.Comments (190)Jennifer GarnerActress; Save the Children Artist AmbassadorAsk my sisters, my mom friends, and certainly me, and we\u0027ll agree that raising kids is challenging under the best of circumstances. But having a close network of fellow parents to lean on and learn from, not to mention a supportive family, has made parenting easier for me. Meanwhile, in isolated, poverty-stricken communities across America, too many moms and dads face parenthood all alone.CommentsDavid ArquetteActor, Mentor, \"Dream School\"In a world full of self-appointed and uncertified judges who wildly swing gavels while pointing their proverbial fingers at anyone that doesn\u0027t fit in, sentencing them to humiliation and ridicule regardless of the fact that their only crime is that of individuality.CommentsNeal WootenWriter, artist and standup comedian; author, \u0027Reternity\u0027 and \u0027The Balance\u0027It amazes me how many of my dear friends in the South perceive this one sin as a conscious choice, but not the other 660-plus sins listed in the Bible. All anti-gay arguments are based solely on personal prejudice, and this is easy to prove.Comments (147)Ros MxCartoonistCommentsMike LuxCo-Founder, Democracy PartnersThe shutdown is the story of the moment. But there are also other real things going on in the real world that have huge consequences for, yes, real people -- and the media shouldn\u0027t ignore those other stories.CommentsAlan ColmesLiberal political commentator, host of \"The Alan Colmes Show\" on Fox News Radio, publisher of alan.com, author of \"Thank the Liberals … For Saving America\"As childish and petulant as House Republicans are behaving, the actions of Republican state legislators with regards to Obamacare is even worse, as they have the power to immediately improve millions of lives, but are stuck in their ideology and hatred.Comments (126)Lori BellUSAF veteran, Motivational Speaker, Inspirational Singer, Military SpousePreneur and momIn the heat of parenting, working, and creating a life together, what transitions a relationship from growing to thriving to long-term?CommentsVeer GidwaneyChief Executive Officer, Maxwell HealthUnless you\u0027ve been living under a rock, you know that this week marked the opening of state- and federal-run insurance marketplaces. While we don\u0027t know how they\u0027ll be regarded over time, initial reactions to them run the gamut from cynicism and uncertainty to measured optimism.CommentsRobert BrusteinPlaywright, director, actor, educator, theater founderH.L. Mencken used to rail again what he called the \"boobocracy\" of America, meaning a system accountable to majorities with little culture, humanity, or intelligence. I think it is time to haul this phrase out of the attic and apply it to our current political condition.Comments (61)Elizabeth B. WydraChief Counsel, Constitutional Accountability CenterWhile most Americans already think Congress is doing a bang up job preventing itself from solving the nation\u0027s problems, the Court will hear a case on the second day of its new Term that could make it even harder for Congress to address one particular issue: the corrupting influence of money in politics.CommentsJessica ProisEditor, HuffPost ImpactClinton has switched careers frequently, is a pragmatic idealist, wants a meaningful life and married the guy who left his hedge fund job to become a ski bum, instead of the Rhodes Scholar whom her father adored. She also said, \"I don\u0027t know\" to a question about her five-year plan. So is she a quintessential millennial?CommentsBill ChameidesDean, Duke University\u0027s Nicholas School of the EnvironmentFracking wastewater can contain massive amounts of brine (salts), toxic metals, and radioactivity. And so the gas companies have a problem: what to do with the stuff.CommentsBrittany GibbonsBlogger, \"Brittany, Herself\"Six hours later, I peeled the moist scuba suit from my body and collapsed on the floor. Filling my lungs to capacity for the first time since being seated on the groom\u0027s side. It burns. It burns so good.Comments (104)Emma GrayEditor, HuffPost Women\"Whether we like it or not, us females in the industry are role models and as such we have to be extremely careful what messages we send to other women,\" writes O\u0027Connor. I would argue that the same missive applies to her. And one message no woman needs to hear is that her body, when not covered up, is not her own.Comments (160)Eduardo PaesMayor, Rio de Janeiro, BrazilThe digital revolution is allowing democracy to recall its foundations and evolution is modernizing and reinforcing our fundamental values. And we are only at the beginning of that journey.CommentsLaurie GerberExecutive, Senior Coach, Handel Group? Life CoachingThe next time we have sex, we have to have it outside of our warm, comfy bed. For some of you, this may be exciting, but I happen to love my cozy bed. What consequence would work well for you?Comments (15)Marcus SamuelssonAward-Winning Chef, Restaurateur \u0026 AuthorPacking lunches and going over menus is a great way to make small changes in the way your kids eat. You can also go a step farther and help change school cafeteria menus. Most schools lack the funds to makeover their kitchens, but parents can help. How can you make a difference?CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorI\u0027ve long stopped asking Congress to do anything to help the economy; I just want them to stop hurting it. It seems crazy to admit, but apparently that\u0027s too much to ask.Comments (21)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesThese candidates are promoted as progressives and sold as such to LGBT and progressive donors, disingenuously using their queerness during Democratic primaries as a way to give them street cred with progressives while their records and intentions are otherwise.Comments (31)Noah CoslovHost \u0026 Managing Editor, CineSportWe\u0027ve seen Durant act in commercials and this didn\u0027t appear to follow \"KD Investigates, Take 2.\" Harden and Dwight Howard were both told CSN Houston that Durant\u0027s comments were sincere and on Friday, Darren Rovell tweeted that Durant and Gatorade were breaking up.CommentsParker Marie Molloy, 2013. 4.10Emma Joslyn, 2013. 4.10Chris Weigant, 2013. 4.10Steve Mariotti, 2013. 4.10Sen.
