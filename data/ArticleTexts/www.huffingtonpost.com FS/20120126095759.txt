{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureLast night in his State of the Union, President Obama presented himself as the champion of the American dream, or in his words, \"the American promise.\" And the instrument of recovering that dream was clearly the need for smart, activist government. But the president\u0027s \"fair shot, fair play, fair share\" agenda must be connected with the urgent battle to put people to work, not tied solely to a more distant promise of reviving the dream. If America is to avoid a second and a third lost decade, the movement that began in Madison, Wisconsin and spread from Wall Street across the country will need to continue to build. We\u0027re still a far remove from the agenda needed to in fact revive the American dream.Read Post | Comments (126)Jason Linkins, 1/25/12Editor, Eat the PressGingrich is attempting to define himself as the candidate in the race with the most appeal to the Hispanic community.

No. The problem is the way people use the free market, a system that readily responds to the compulsive appetite of greed.

Among defenders of Cynthia Nixon\u0027s \"choice\" remarks are those who say that, just as Americans choose their religion, why can\u0027t we choose our sexual orientation?Read Post | Comments (194)Al Gore, 1/25/12Chairman, Current TVThe West Antarctic Peninsula is warming about four times faster than the global average.

Getting her children to elementary school late.Read Post | Comments (97)Mariska Hargitay, 1/25/12ActressWe as a society must build on this achievement and take further steps to acknowledge that sexual violence affects men and boys. We must commit ourselves to engaging men in the movement to address, prevent and, one day, end all sexual violence.Read Post | Comments (107)Chris Weigant, 1/25/12Political Writer and Blogger at ChrisWeigant.comPresident Obama last night called for a minimum tax rate of 30 percent on income over one million dollars. To some, this sounds like a radical idea, but it really isn\u0027t.Read Post | CommentsBennett L. Gershman, 1/25/12Professor of Law, PaceIs there any connection between the eugenics movement and the anti-choice movement?

But victory can\u0027t be declared until the banks actually move several hundred billion in mortgage writedowns, and some indictments are issued.Read Post | Comments (19)Dan Collins, 1/25/12New York Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostTalk about a non-starter.

Both are attempting to appeal to frustrated and disillusioned blue-collar and middle-class voters.Read Post | Comments (16)Jared Bernstein, 1/25/12Senior Fellow, Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesPolitifact -- the self-anointed fact checkers -- graded a statement from the president\u0027s speech as \"half-true.\" But the statement is not half true or even two-thirds true.
