{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Award-Winning Author of Freestyle: Reflections on Faith, Family, Justice, and Pop Culture; Founding Pastor of Joy Tabernacle A.M.E. Church in Dallas, TexasTo date, no ISIS member or Syrian refugee has ever bombed or planned to bomb a black church or home. Nor have they walked into a Bible Study in the basement of a black church and unleashed a hail of bullets. Neither are they at fault for the continuing epidemic of unarmed black men, women, boys, and girls murdered by police officers in the streets of America. They have not turned our communities into militarized zones, nor have black people mysteriously died in their prisons. In our seeking forth for justice, let us not overlook the terror long lurking inside our own doors. For whole communities of Americans, the greatest terrorist threat is not now trying to enter our country. It has been here for a long time.The case of Abigail Hanna--the pretty, blonde 21-year-old who allegedly kidnapped a toddler she once cared for--has the media fascinated.

However, before we blame the bird, let\u0027s dig deeper for the facts.Gluten-Free Living Expert \u0026 Recipe Developer; Author, The Gluten-Free Solution; Creator, GlutenFreeGigi.com; Editor, Food Solutions MagazineThis Thanksgiving, I\u0027m thankful for all you nurses out there -- who abandon everything about your own needs and wants, to make this world a better place for everyone else you take care of. I\u0027m thankful for my wife -- an ICU nurse -- my hero.Husband, father, worship pastorMacy\u0027s Thanksgiving Day Parade isn\u0027t a festive event; it\u0027s a prolonged commercial that manipulates families into buying products they don\u0027t need. t\u0027s time Americans really see this event for what it really is, snap out of the shopping spirit and focus on real values.American Politics/Pop Culture Satire IG: @american__jesusI believe the United States is in the midst of making a major and very damaging mistake in relationship to ISIS.

Meanwhile, every year, their health care costs rise. Their employers eliminate pensions. And their kids struggle with rising college tuition and debt. By contrast, on the other side of the Macy\u0027s Thanksgiving Day Parade, the richest 1 percent are supersizing their feasts.International President, United SteelworkersHow we eat is one of the central ways we show who we are and what we care about, but what\u0027s almost entirely impossible is to put food on the table that was produced by workers who enjoy the same rights as almost every other laborer in America.NYC-based Professor at Columbia\u0027s Mailman School of Public Health, Jewish activist and OpEd Project Public Voices Fellow.I worry when my husband attends a crowded college football game. I worry when I attend any type of religious event. I worry when I\u0027m in a crowded a flea market, when I think about traveling with my family, when I hear a siren screaming in the distance. I worry for the innocence lost, the lives cut short, the souls that leave too early.Wife, Twin Mommy, bloggymamma.comThere seems to be a mad rush in the media to analyze Black Friday. Yet, every analysis misses the point that Black Friday, which though on the surface seems like just vile consumerism, is actually, for some, quite a meaningful, ritualistic experience.Social Scientist, Duke UniversityIf you\u0027re hosting Thanksgiving for a guest with a history of food-related issues, you can\u0027t eliminate every single trigger from your table. But there are some small things you can do that will have a huge impact -- for them, and for all your guests.Writer, editor, feminist, Oxford comma enthusiastAs we move forward, we must be vigilant -- to fairly allocate the burdens of who\u0027s called on to fight the war, to protect civil liberties, to protect innocent civilians abroad, to avoid hate and bigotry, and to fairly distribute the cost of paying for war. These aren\u0027t just worthy aims.

Some have used the fact that Officer Van Dyke has been charged with murder to advance the narrative that he was a \"bad apple\" acting outside the culture of the department.Deputy Legal Director and the Director of the Center for Justice, ACLUIn an all-Indian school, as I recall, we didn\u0027t elaborate by acting out the parts of Pilgrims and Indians. I recall speaking to a lady of Kiowa descent who talked about the actions of her fellow students in a public school in Oklahoma. She said she was hurt and embarrassed to see the white children paint their faces and stick cardboard feathers in their hair while they danced and whooped like Hollywood Indians.Founder, Native American Journalists AssociationTed Cruz is so thrilled that someone who wants abortion providers to be killed is supporting him that he actually sent out a press release to celebrate the endorsement. Is that what this Republican primary has come to? No one should tolerate calls to put someone to death because of his or her legal profession.Actress, Activist, People For the American Way Foundation Board MemberWealth is something we all have: if not monetary riches, we have our time, our love of family, our dedication to our great nation, and many ways that we can share joy and be generous with our efforts, because generosity enhances our humanity.Grantmaking foundationEvery person deserves a safe, stable place to call home.
