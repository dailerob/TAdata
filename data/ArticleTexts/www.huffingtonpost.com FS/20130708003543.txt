{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonFrom watching cable, you\u0027d think the only news this week was the George Zimmerman trial. But as CNN spent Wednesday breathlessly team-covering every angle of some badly-Skyped-in testimony, a hint of other news appeared in a small box on-screen, captioned \"coup under way.\" That was, of course, referring to the fact that Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi was being toppled. Is this monomaniacal coverage really the best way to honor Trayvon Martin\u0027s memory? It was enough to send me clicking over to the Golf Channel -- and I don\u0027t even play, though I did learn what a mulligan is. If the media took one, maybe next time, in addition to Egypt, they\u0027d also cover yet another middling jobs report released on Friday, which showed the economy adding mostly low-wage jobs and still on pace to reach full-employment only by decade\u0027s end. But don\u0027t tell anybody.Comments (173)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027What do I love about America? I especially love our best national values: freedom, opportunity, community, justice, human rights, and equality under the law for all of our citizens of every race, creed, culture, and gender, not just for the rich and powerful.Comments (595)Louise LeakeyAssistant Research Professor of Anthropology, University of Stony BrookWhat the fossil record does is force us to contemplate our place on the planet. We are but one species of several hominids that inhabited planet earth and like our distant cousins who went extinct fairly recently, our time on planet earth is also finite.Comments (1,990)Shinz? Abe96th Prime Minister of Japan, President of the Liberal Democratic PartyWe are committed to build a robust Japan that will continue to foster and preserve global commons, and contribute to the peace and stability of the world. In 20 years time, we will marvel at how much Japan has changed.Comments (105)Arianna HuffingtonMandela\u0027s leadership lessons will belong to the ages, just as Lincoln\u0027s leadership lessons do. Two very different men, but they shared the same defining qualities that we need in the 21st century.Comments (356)Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoIt is, of course, difficult to assess the performance of the FISA court, because its activities are secret. But with 30 years of experience, it is possible to offer some reflections and suggestions.Comments (260)Robert RedfordActor, director and environmental activistWithout question, we\u0027re facing a climate crisis. And it is taxpayers who are bearing the high costs.Comments (810)Janus AdamsEmmy Award-winning journalist, historian and producerFounding Fathers, you got it together by making a few compromises. How\u0027s it working for you now? The bargaining chips you played then -- slaves, women, Native Americans -- are still being played today.Comments (509)Kirk DouglasActorI\u0027ve lived a long time. Almost 97 years. I\u0027ve seen a lot of fear-mongering, bigotry and discrimination. But now I\u0027m also seeing a modern generation of children who view the world very differently than their parents and grandparents.Comments (1,047)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarSelf-sufficiency isn\u0027t something most kids are born with. The school year, with its rigorous after-school sports and activity schedules, doesn\u0027t offer this sort of platform for learning how to be alone, or for knowing how to create their own fun -- a skill that\u0027s not only a good thing but also essential.Comments (254)Mohamed A. El-ErianCEO and co-CIO, PIMCOEgyptian citizens are determined realists. They have overcome the fear that imprisoned them for so long but they are yet to reach a new national equilibrium. They care deeply about overcoming repression, social injustice and economic incompetence. And they will not hesitate to return to the streets in their millions.Comments (107)Martha BurkMoney Editor, Ms. magazine; director, Corporate Accountability Project, National Council of Women\u0027s OrganizationsOn this 237th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, the daughters of 2013 still don\u0027t have equal constitutional rights with men, though many Americans think otherwise. Nope.Comments (499)Ahmed Shihab-EldinEmmy-Nominated Producer/Host, @HuffPostLiveI understand why so many (namely President Obama) are careful not to call this a coup. But whatever we call it, we must acknowledge the basic facts.Comments (619)Cassandra JacksonProfessor of English, The College of New JerseyI realize that it is disturbing to think that there might be one privilege that black people have that white people do not. Therefore, I am going to set the record straight.Comments (906)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorIn an age of increased jingoism about freedom and American ideals, the comparative yardsticks of patriotism should be applied frequently and meticulously to the large U.S. corporations that rove the world seeking advantages from other countries, to the detriment of the United States.Comments (736)Vivian NorrisPh.D. focusing on Globalization and Media StudiesDo not make him dinner, do not go fetch him a cold beer from the fridge, do not iron that shirt, hell, do not change that diaper... do not make his life a little nicer this summer if he does not \"get it\" and learn to respect women!Comments (2,400)Victor J. WilliPhD History, Oxford UniversityWhat happened yesterday is phenomenal and unprecedented in Egyptian history. While millions of Egyptians cheered and partied until in the early morning on June 30th, and then again yesterday, following the sacking of Morsi, there is, however, a flip side to the coin.Comments (257)Toula FoscolosNews DirectorThis past Wednesday, Justin Timberlake debuted his third single, \"Tunnel Vision,\" which quickly deteriorates into an ocean of boobs. Waves and waves of boobs...Comments (591)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThis report, with its positive revisions, a whiff of increased labor force participation, and a bit of pop in wages suggests not just an improving job market, but one that\u0027s improving a bit faster than we thought.Comments (96)Marissa HigginsWriter4. \"Who\u0027s the guy in your relationship?\"Ouch. Some aspects of the patriarchy simply don\u0027t apply in same-sex relationships, and someone having to be \"the guy\" in a lesbian relationship is one of them.Comments (282)Kia MakarechiEntertainment Editor, The Huffington PostA man from a marginalized American community reaches the top of the corporate world, sees post-teen starlets popularizing lame impressions of black culture and raps about it on an album made possible by and distributed through the U.S. division of a South Korean cellphone company. Only in America.Comments (397)Lindsey MeadWriter, A Design So VastThirty-eight is not having any more grandparents. It is going to funerals, and also christenings, more often than weddings. Thirty-eight is the middle place.Comments (161)Mike RyanSenior Entertainment Writer, The Huffington PostFor the life of me, I just can\u0027t figure out whom this movie is for, which is why I find it so fascinating. Before I saw the movie, I just assumed it would be for kids. It is not for kids. (At my screening, I witnessed wary adults lead a mass exodus of children after the villain slices out the heart of a still living human being, then takes a bite.)Comments (1,148)Cecile RichardsPresident of Planned Parenthood Federation of America and Planned Parenthood Action FundThe Texas Legislature is back at the Capitol today, trying to pass a bill that would wipe out access to safe and legal abortion for millions of women in the state. If this all sounds familiar, it\u0027s because we\u0027ve seen this bill before.Comments (311)Dr. Michael J. BreusClinical Psychologist; Board Certified Sleep SpecialistUnderstanding with greater specificity the health and lifestyle conditions that may increase risk of sleep apnea can lead to better screening and treatment options.Comments (53)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureIt\u0027s time to remember these forgotten Americans -- our brothers and sisters, our neighbors, friends and children -- and to take action to help them. In this time of celebrated patriotism, anything less is hypocrisy.Comments (275)Ann BrenoffSenior Writer, The Huffington PostThe trick is not to just downsize our homes but our expectations as well. And there\u0027s no better time to start practicing going simpler than now. Take a staycation, line up a home swap, tell your friends that from now on, dinners at your place will be potlucks.Comments (105)Ekow N. YankahProfessor of Law, Cardozo School of LawOn this Fourth of July, it is the basic realization that rolling up your sleeves and being a part of your political community, rather than grasping at a fuzzy picture of a cowboy alone on a plain, is the true display of virtue.Comments (449)Cherie BlairFounder, Cherie Blair Foundation for WomenOften women are pushed into running a business as a last resort rather than making the choice themselves. There are huge demands placed on women in East Africa in particular and yet they are offered little support.CommentsJustin MossOpera Lecturer and ExpertOriginally brought to America through tours presenting traditional European operas, to the vaudeville interpretation, and the simultaneous development of jazz, blues, and musical theater, opera in America has searched for its own identity.Comments (11)Mario LivioAstrophysicist, Space Telescope Science InstituteWhere did the atoms of hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, phosphorus, and iron (all essential for life) come from? When Joni Mitchell sang \"We are stardust,\" she was poetically giving the correct answer to this question.CommentsBradley Foster, 2013. 7.07Nancy Doyle Palmer, 2013. 7.07Jeff Cohen, 2013. 7.07Lauren Taylor Shute, 2013. 7.07Richard C.
