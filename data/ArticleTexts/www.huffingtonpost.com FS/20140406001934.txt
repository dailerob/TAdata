{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundEven children who are not directly hit by gun violence suffer the collateral damage of living in an unsafe environment saturated with guns that are routinely used to settle conflicts or to exact retaliation. A striking number of low-income children in New Orleans have witnessed gun violence and murders, according to a 2011-2012 screening of children between the ages of 11 and 15 who participated in a teen pregnancy prevention program. Of the 700 interviewed by the Institute of Women and Ethnic Studies, 29 percent had witnessed assaults with guns; 14 percent had witnessed gun homicides. More than half cited concern about “personal safety” as a source of worry, more than twice the number who worried about “being unloved.” Not surprisingly, the children reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress and depression at a much higher rate — about one-third — than typical teenagers.When one considers the security situation, the threats made by the Taliban, and the miserable weather, the election result has been quite phenomenal. There is something immensely humbling to see groups of people holding up their dyed fingers, as much as to say \u0027Suck to you, Taliban!\u0027Duncan AndersonBritish academic based in Kabul working to help re-establish Afghan tertiary institutionsIf you have a heartbeat, you are one of the vast majority of Americans thoroughly disgusted by this week\u0027s McCutcheon Supreme Court decision. It allows one donor to write a $3.6 million check to buy political influence, providing us all with yet another \"just-when-you-thought-it-couldn\u0027t-get-any-worse\" moment.Josh SilverDirector, Represent.UsShe\u0027s a model and a beauty pageant queen now. But she reveals that her life started out in a very different place. Don\u0027t miss Geena Rocero\u0027s powerful story about identity, gender and finding the courage to be your true self.TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"I\u0027ve been tweezing, shaving, moisturizing, defrizzing, flat-ironing, bikini-waxing, gym-joining (notice I said gym-joining, not gym-going?) exfoliating and manicuring since 8th grade, all while sleeping on a silk pillowcase to reduce wrinkles. I\u0027m ready to grow a beard and just RELAX.Anastasia BasilWriter. Worrier.Democrats, from this point on, should adopt a very simple technique to disarm Republican squabbles about Obamacare numbers. To every figure quoted for people gaining health insurance, Democrats should end with \"... and counting.\"Chris WeigantPolitical writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comConnect the dots and you see how the big-money takeover of our democracy has led to an economy that\u0027s barely functioning for most Americans.Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027In what universe would Apple or Google tell a high school programming prodigy that he or she had to attend a year of college before joining their team?Ben HallmanSenior Financial Writer, The Huffington PostThe debate over e-cigarettes has been heating up. Are the smokeless, battery-powered, nicotine-dispensing devices a gateway to smoking for young people or a helpful way for smokers to quit? Public health experts can be found on both sides of the debate.Ruth MacklinProfessor of epidemiology \u0026 population health, Albert Einstein College of MedicineI thought of Russell Conwell\u0027s bizarre nineteenth-century theological glorification of wealth this past week when the Supreme Court removed one of the last remaining limits on the amount of money wealthy donors could spend in political campaigns.James ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Clearly, the company made a business decision that the reality of its CEO\u0027s anti-LGBT actions was inconsistent with its continued financial well-being. Consumers have a lot of choices these days and why shouldn\u0027t a CEO\u0027s giving influence consumers\u0027 perceptions of a company?Deena FidasDirector of the Workplace Equality Program at the Human Rights CampaignMy wife went through labor and then hours later had an emergency C-section. It is funny how you both consider a C-section a quick \"pop a baby out and have dinner after.\" It is major surgery. There is a lot of recovery.Tony PosnanskiWriter, \u0027The Anti-Jared\u0027These kinds of subtle connections, floated out in headlines, ledes and in repeated questions to experts in endless cable news coverage, result in reinforcement of stigma and a lost opportunity to educate viewers and readers on what mental illness and PTSD really are.Mark JoyellaEmmy Award-winning journalistIt was nice while it lasted. Democracy at the national level is dead now. We have replaced it with an open auction. This will not at some future date lead to a worst case scenario. We\u0027re already living in that scenario.Cenk UygurHost, \u0027The Young Turks\u0027It\u0027s easy for teen\u0027s to forgo sleep because they have so many things competing for their time and attention, including homework, social functions and after-school activities. However, teens will ultimately function better in all of these areas when they make time for adequate rest.Bobbi DePorterPresident of Quantum Learning NetworkWalmart benefits from food stamps in multiple ways, as taxpayers both underwrite the company\u0027s food sales and also subsidize its payroll costs.Amy TraubSenior Policy Analyst at DemosThe National Rifle Association propaganda has it all wrong. Most violent acts are committed by people who are not crazy. And even when mental illness does play a role, we do not have the tools to identify which person will go berserk or prevent it from happening.Allen FrancesProfessor Emeritus, Duke UniversityThis shouldn\u0027t be viewed as extraordinary behavior for a dad. It should be ordinary. Hopefully he\u0027ll open up the doors for other professional athletes to follow his lead.Doyin RichardsFather, husband, author, and blogger at Daddy Doin\u0027 WorkThere is a place for privacy in loving, trusting relationships, and it\u0027s important to remember that a person\u0027s request for privacy doesn\u0027t mean he\u0027s up to no good. Similarly, putting your significant other on your shortlist of those with access to your info does not necessarily mean you have intimacy or connection.Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarA few reactions to Letterman\u0027s retirement announcement bring up the idea that he may be stepping down because he never \"got\" the viral video phenomenon that Fallon and Kimmel have so clearly mastered. I say, nuts to that. Letterman invented viral videos -- we just called them \"watercooler moments,\" and they were spread with your lips, not your fingertips.Noah MallinDigital Advertising, Content and Startup AdvisorHere in the United States our toxic chemical policy is best described as caveat emptor -- let the buyer beware -- and it\u0027s making us sick.Elliott NeginDirector of News \u0026 Commentary, Union of Concerned ScientistsIf you know that by getting to the front of the line you are able to see or anticipate some material number of the trades that are about to happen, you are GUARANTEED to make a profit. What is the definition of a rigged market? When you are guaranteed to make a profit.Mark CubanOwner, Dallas Mavericks; Chairman, AXS TVWhen I married my husband in 1991, I was in my late 20s and my husband was, well, a few years younger. It wasn\u0027t a massive age gap but -- as the years went on -- I\u0027d be lying if I said I didn\u0027t think about it from time to time.Shelley EmlingSenior Editor, HuffPost 50We still must do more to extend opportunity to those who live on society\u0027s margins. With patience, persistence and partnership, we can create economic opportunity for every person willing to work hard for it.Thomas E. PerezU.S. Secretary of LaborAccording to Sullivan, the gay mafia has struck again, destroying a man and bringing him down because he would not conform to its thinking.Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesIf cloud computing were a country, it would rank sixth in the world on the basis of how much electricity it uses, and the amount of data shuttling around the world is expected to triple in the next few years as more and more people get connected.Kumi NaidooExecutive Director, Greenpeace InternationalThe notion that there is one soul mate for everyone is ludicrous. If you expand the definition, a soul mate doesn\u0027t even have to be romantic. My best friend is a soul mate; my son is a soul mate; a man I knew but never even kissed is a soul mate.Evelyn LauerChicago-based writer and teacher, working on a memoir about loveBut as dedicated and conscientious as some of the intelligence committees\u0027 members and staff are, there is a pattern of institutional failure. For much too long, the intelligence committees have been trying to do oversight in almost complete secrecy.Katherine HawkinsNational Security Fellow, OpenTheGovernment.Org. Views my own.The remedies to their common problem should be the same for both The Post and FiveThirtyEight. Both must correct the record and be forceful when they do. This means publishing a correction connected to the original piece.Daniel KesslerCommunications Director at CEL\u0027s Climate LabPolicy solutions are easy to come up with. The enormous challenge is that the more wealth is concentrated, the harder it becomes to enact those policies.Richard KirschSenior Fellow, Roosevelt Institute; author of \u0027Fighting for Our Health\u0027Answers to this puzzle are more known than is generally appreciated. Taking an approach that identifies and addresses risk and protective factors in violence, whether it be directed against the self or others, is one thing we can do right now.Lloyd I.
