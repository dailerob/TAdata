{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"I\u0027ll be in Washington tomorrow, taking part in festivities leading to Sunday\u0027s formal dedication of the National Memorial honoring the life and legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. The 30-foot statue of Dr. King emerging from a chunk of granite is the first monument on the National Mall honoring an African American. Its design was inspired by a line from his \"I Have a Dream\" speech: \"With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope.\" The tension between hope and despair is fitting, given the unfulfilled nature of so many of King\u0027s hopes and dreams for America. That\u0027s why the dedication of the King monument couldn\u0027t come at a more opportune time. Hopefully it will refocus our attention on the principles he stood for, inspiring all Americans to tap into the better angels he was guided by.Read Post | CommentsRobert Reich, 8/25/11Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Aftershock\u0027Let\u0027s bag the picnics and parades this Labor Day.

Paul Brandeis Raushenbush is the Senior Religion Editor for the Huffington PostThe faith of King is not conservative, one that insists on looking backwards for the \"better days\" that in reality never were.
