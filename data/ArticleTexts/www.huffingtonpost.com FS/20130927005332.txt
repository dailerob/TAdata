{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Howard FinemanEditorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupThe Republican Party used to be dull and relatively reasonable. It stood for spending restraint, free markets (for big companies) and gentle regulation of business. But it also stood for, or accepted, federal public works and scientific research, a foreign policy that was neither isolationist nor war-mongering, the use of federal power in the name of racial justice, progressive taxation, and a public piety of the most anodyne, “In God We Trust” kind. The party of Dwight Eisenhower -- of Scotch and soda and sotto voce -- is all but extinct. What’s left of it is barricaded in the U.S. Senate, under fire in a deadly turf war with Blue Meth Republicanism, a movement at times so angry, reductionist, apocalyptic, God-invoking, fear-mongering and obsessed with purity that it seems to have been concocted in the sub-basement of \"Breaking Bad.\"Comments (1,157)Bob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowHow many are \"enough?\" How many \"good guys?\" How many guns? Indeed, there will never be enough \"good guys with guns\" for LaPierre\u0027s taste, chiefly because the NRA\u0027s sole mission is to sell as many guns as they can.Comments (44)Jacob SokolFounder, SensophyI found out there are a lot of people like me -- young, energetic, intense, purpose-driven, but frustrated with the status quo and a little freaked out about our prospects for the future. I couldn\u0027t just wait for happiness and satisfaction to find me; I was going to have to make my own.Comments (194)Ann BrenoffSenior Writer, The Huffington PostThere seems to be an epidemic of specialized diets going around. We can argue til the cows come home whether gluten-free or veganism makes you healthier or morally superior to me, but as a rule, I tend to dislike zealots of any stripe.Comments (264)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027A new pope named Francis is reminding us that love is also a verb. In a tweet, Francis said: \"God will judge us upon how we have treated the most needy.\" Is there a word that more needs to be heard in Washington today than that one? I couldn\u0027t think of any.Comments (14)Terrell ThomasCornerback, New York GiantsIt was not through a charity act on the part of the Giants that gave me the opportunity to play football again -- I regained my spot on the team through months of hard work.CommentsValerie JarrettSenior Advisor to the President and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsAs an estimated 1 billion additional women enter the global workforce over the next decade, it will be the nations who invest in women\u0027s education, training and full inclusion in the workforce that find themselves in position to compete and lead the world economy.Comments (30)Tom EngelhardtEditor, TomDispatch.comBarack Obama is only the latest in a jostling crowd of candidates, politicians, and minor figures of every sort, not to speak of a raging horde of neocons and pundits galore, who have felt compelled in recent years to tell us and the world just how exceptional the United States really is.Comments (86)Jeff DanzigerPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideComments (11)Heather Bauer, RD, CDNNutritionist, Author, EntrepreneurIt can be confusing and daunting at first, but familiarizing yourself with the nutrition content of the food you\u0027re putting into your body will help you really learn about different nutrients and encourage you to make better choices.CommentsRep. Chris Van HollenCongressman representing Maryland\u0027s 8th DistrictThere are two questions Republicans in Congress don\u0027t want you to ask about Obamacare. First, if Obamcare is so bad, why does the Republican budget rely on major parts of Obamacare in order to balance? Second, if Obamacare will ruin us, why is the Republican plan for Medicare based on virtually the same model as Obamacare?Comments (204)Claire FallonDeputy Blog Editor, The Huffington PostThe sad thing about Gilmour\u0027s blatantly sexist comments is that it reveals the deeply ingrained misogyny -- and homophobia and racism -- that runs throughout the literary world as a whole, and academia in particular.CommentsJoanna ZelmanFront page editor, The Huffington PostDeep inside travelers lies a dark secret. It presents itself innocently enough, just a twinge as you\u0027re walking a foreign street, a slight ache that\u0027s probably just a little fatigue or hunger or maybe sun poisoning? Could you be -- no, you won\u0027t even let the word slip into your frontal lobe.Comments (60)Caitlyn BeckerProducer, HuffPost LiveBefore I head out the door to go anywhere I usually make sure I have the Holy Trinity in my possession: Cell phone, wallet, lip gloss. Last night, I failed to do my check and it wasn\u0027t until I was on the subway that I realized the error of my ways.CommentsJamie CourtAuthor, \u0027The Progressive\u0027s Guide to Raising Hell\u0027; President, Consumer WatchdogThe ruling will have lasting impact beyond Google. This is a very big consumer victory for the right to use the Internet without having to give up one\u0027s privacy.Comments (15)Dillon PeñaMakeup artistWhen you recently ordered that same-sex partners of servicemembers in the Oklahoma National Guard not receive the spousal benefits that their partners earned and that their heterosexual counterparts enjoy, you boldly declared that people like me are not equal in your eyes.Comments (118)Matt FrazierVegan marathoner; Author, \u0027No Meat Athlete\u0027The commitment to officially say \"I\u0027m vegan\" was a decision I deliberated about for a long time. Now that this once extreme lifestyle now feels familiar, I have just enough perspective to wish I could go back and give my pre-vegan self (or someone else in my shoes) a few pointers.Comments (70)Ted Danson and Andrew SharplessYesterday the Washington Post published a dangerously misleading article about farmed salmon. Lauding improvements in the salmon farming industry, they assert that farmed salmon is a viable alternative to wild-caught fish. We\u0027d like to set the record straight: farmed salmon is a terrible choice for our oceans.Comments (14)Evelyn LeopoldVeteran journalist reporting from the United NationsThe new Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, has mounted a \"charm\" offensive to convince Americans he\u0027s not as heavy-handed as his predecessor. His main goal is to get sanctions lifted. But his speech to the UN was a bit heavy-handed, except for the outreach for talks with the West.Comments (173)Bill ChameidesDean, Duke University\u0027s Nicholas School of the EnvironmentIs China really contemplating eschewing coal for cleaner fuels to address environmental issues like climate change?  Or is it just a case of China talking green while walking further and further down coal-emission road?CommentsJohn David HawkinsManaging partner, The Hawkins Law Firm; former South Carolina state senatorAs a state senator I was active in working for a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage. With time and much consideration, not to mention a dose of enlightenment and empathy, I realize my past positions in this regard were wrong.Comments (23)Dedrick MuhammadSenior Director of Economic Programs, NAACPThough 401(k) plans (a defined contribution retirement plan) are supposed to build wealth, a new study by the Economic Policy Institute suggests that these plans are actually exacerbating wealth inequality by not adequately providing for most people\u0027s retirement.Comments (22)Kathleen ReardonProfessor, USC Marshall School; Author, \u0027The Secret Handshake\u0027 and \u0027Shadow Campus\u0027There are issues that you just have to get in front of if you\u0027re going to win an argument or an election. The leader among potential election-breakers requiring Hillary Clinton\u0027s early attention is, of course, what has come to be known simply as \"Benghazi.\"Comments (68)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Comments (429)Maureen RyanTV critic, The Huffington PostHow many people spent the months since the Season 2 finale saying, \"I wonder what\u0027s up with Dana?\"CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThe Washington Post today published a profile of Rep. Steve Southerland, focusing on his attack on the SNAP -- formerly food stamps --program. Unfortunately, the piece suffers from such mammoth omissions that it is ultimately quite misleading.Comments (34)Rep. Earl BlumenauerU.S. Representative from OregonIraq is a country that is on the verge of collapse. Violence is on the upswing, and these people who bravely served America have been left twisting in the wind. Many have been forced into hiding. Others and their families have not just been threatened; they\u0027ve been killed.CommentsDiana NyadLong-distance swimmer, journalist, and broadcasterIf it was an 18-hour swim, it was never 17 hours, 57 minutes. It was 18. Along with the training, the organization of an expedition this size, 45 people out into the wilderness that is the unpredictable and dangerous stretch between Cuba and Florida, is monumental.Comments (12)Elliott NeginDirector of News \u0026 Commentary, Union of Concerned ScientistsNuclear power proponents pinning their hopes on small modular nuclear reactors to resurrect the industry\u0027s fortunes likely will be disappointed, according to a report released today by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS).Comments (56)Arlene Nisson LassinWriterAs they waltzed around, locked in an embrace, looking at each other lovingly, they seemed to be sharing a bond that few of the rest of us could ever know or understand. Related by shared bone marrow and white blood cells, they danced the wedding\u0027s first special dance together.CommentsBarbara BrunoNFL Analyst and Commentator, Independent Film Producer, Non-Profit Grant WriterNow that we\u0027ve reached Week 4 of the 2013 NFL season, game picks start to settle into two categories: 1) clearly the better team but will they win by enough? And 2) who can pull off an upset?Comments (14)Candace Calloway Whiting, 2013.26.09Paul Pape, 2013.26.09Charles Radcliffe, 2013.26.09Muhammad Yunus, 2013.26.09Barry Lando, 2013.26.09Jonathan Kim, 2013.26.09Jim Werner, 2013.26.09Amy Andre, 2013.26.09Common Sense Media, 2013.26.09Gilles Herrada, Ph.D., 2013.26.09Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"CAN\u0027T EVEN PASS THEIR OWN PLAN!",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechnologyYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
