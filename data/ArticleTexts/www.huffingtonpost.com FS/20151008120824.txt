{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressThe New Hampshire primary is four months away, and as any political wag will tell you, it\u0027s a contest that tends to \"break late.\" Back in 2008, in fact, the primary broke late very memorably, with Hillary Clinton prevailing just a day and a half after being all-but-completely written off in the state. Flash forward to today, and New Hampshire has, in the early days of the campaign, turned into the testing ground for Sen. Bernie Sanders\u0027 presidential viability. So what should Clinton do? Well, according to \"one small contingent of family allies,\" who are also idiots, she should panic and do something rash for no real good reason.What I found to be true for me is that without a good night\u0027s rest, I was more emotional, less resilient, less focused, had loss of memory and was more impatient. Just grumpy. That made my day super long and I was someone who wasn\u0027t as pleasant to be around. As a leader -- that\u0027s not a good thing.CHRO @ LinkedIn, Mother, Introvert, Writer, Artist, Adventurer - Always Curious -Leading with Authenticity - Having Fun!The United States has the highest per capita rate of gun ownership in the world and the highest incidence of gun deaths in the developed world. Yet a toxic mix of history, culture, politics and money is preventing -- and will continue to prevent -- the U.S. from significantly restricting the private ownership of firearms.Global Editorial DirectorGoing through such a seismic, existential shift in my life? -- ?transitioning in a military prison -- presents real, meaningful, and daily challenges.Former U.S. Army intelligence analyst, military whistleblower and democracy advocateOn the surface, Sanders looks like a concerned 74-year old grandfather who has spent his political career serving a state that is 95 percent White. But go a little deeper and you will find that there is much more to the man who some believe has what it takes to pulverize the political machine.The premiere online magazine destination for African-American cultural insight, news and perspective.Jobs that involve people skills but don\u0027t require prolonged educations should rise in status. Perhaps the cafes of the future will feature highly paid waiters serving lattes to impoverished lawyers.Author, The Sceptical Optimist: Why Technology Isn\u0027t the Answer to EverythingBing Crosby was 12 years older than Frank Sinatra, but their careers pretty much overlapped for the 37 years from 1941 to 1977, when Crosby died. They formed a mutual admiration society and appeared together on TV and radio and, most memorably, in the 1960 film High Society. So why the disparity in the degree to which they are remembered?Davidson-Kahn Distinguished University Professor and Professor of Law at Florida International University; Floershimer Distinguished Visiting Professor of Law at Cardozo Law SchoolThis new research provides one more compelling argument in favor of expanding Social Security. In addition to its possible impact in reducing or delaying Alzheimer\u0027s and other dementia in some seniors, expanding those modest benefits addresses other serious challenges facing our country.Founding Co-director, Social Security WorksISIS is the first terrorist group that behaves like a state. It has territory to defend, a future to protect. They may want a nuclear bomb for the same reason states do: defense. If our military actions truly threaten them, they will threaten to go nuclear, hoping to deter our attacks. Short of a nuclear explosive bomb, a dirty bomb threat may serve the same function.President, Ploughshares Fund; Author, \u0027Nuclear Nightmares: Securing the World Before It Is Too Late\u0027Now, the concept of \"going to the gym\" has been increasingly overshadowed by niche fitness classes. All of them promising to be the best workout you will ever get on planet earth. These classes also come with pretty package incentives, which are absurdly overpriced and can hardly be considered motivation to join.TV Producer turned Comedian and CommentatorAs the refugee influx continues unabated, it is gratifying to see that our humanity is finally showing signs of life. Our leaders are at last heeding what their voters are telling them and starting to question the pandering to anti-immigration voices.Director General of United Nations Office at GenevaI want you to learn at a very early age to be comfortable talking about your anxieties, struggles and fears. Most importantly, I hope these eight things help you live an authentic life with the understanding that you\u0027re never alone.Lifestyle Blog Editor, The Huffington PostJournalists try to gather information. Protesters try to push buttons. Sam Dorman\u0027s admission that he was trying to push a button on Pelosi and provoke the response he got is all the evidence we need that he was in protest mode, not journalist mode.Founder and Editor, ConWebWatch.com; former senior editor, Media MattersA true winner, as Trump claims himself to be in life, would go all-in. Now. Immediately. But, Trump is not a true winner. He is an insecure, whining showman. A wimp.Last person on Earth not on FacebookAs a firearm owner, I\u0027ve researched, studied, and enjoyed sport-shooting for years; however, I hold no romantic ideas about firearms: They are tools of death. Education is about life while firearms are about taking life. There should be no confusion about which we should support on college campuses.Writer, Professor, Rhetorician, \u0026 Internet ResearcherThe loss of my fertility is not going to define me. I do not want people to feel bad for me. I don\u0027t want people to question why I need to do IVF because I got pregnant so quickly the first time. I don\u0027t need questions about everything we have tried.Communicator, advocate, news junkie, proud Democrat and mom to pit bull Max living the sweet life in Portland, Ore.\"I\u0027m a grinder....I\u0027ve never taken more than a week off in my adult life. I truly believe work is a virtue, it gives you purpose. I love my family, love my grandkids.\"theSkimm makes it easier to be smarter. We read. You Skimm. Sign up at www.theskimm.com/huffpo to start your day off right.It is an untenable situation, an insult to the institutions -- Federal Police, MPF, House of Representatives -- and one that jeopardizes the fight against corruption. Resign, Cunha.Editor in Chief at Brasil PostI have high-functioning autism. I was diagnosed at age three. A lot of people on the spectrum do not go to college, or are unemployed, or do go and may not succeed. I was one of the ones who thrived.Author of two books, artist, autism advocate, University of Miami law studentIn implicating Trump as a bigot and, by association, the audience as cohorts or sheep, the media, especially the photo media, thoroughly missed the most curious and unscripted moment of this dispiriting campaign.Publisher of the visual politics and media literacy site, Reading The Pictures.The fact is, these standards are good for everyone. That\u0027s why none of the efforts to repeal the standards this year--that\u0027s zero--have succeeded. And for the sake of our students, I\u0027m proud to say I\u0027m confident they never will.Former Governor, New Mexico; former U.S. Ambassador to the UN, former Secretary of Energy; Founder and President of the Richardson Center for Global EngagementThe fate of women in Afghanistan has been the moral linchpin for the continued occupation by U.S. and NATO forces since the presidency of George W. Bush. But according to experts and women across the war-torn country, little has changed for women there despite upwards of $1.5 billion spent to empower women and girls.Political activist and authorLondon-based journalistIf none of the Republicans were swayed after Sandy Hook, what are the chances now? The only way they\u0027d vote for gun control would be if corporations were getting shot because those are the only \"people\" they really care about.Comedian/Breathing EnthusiastWhen I lay down in my comfortable apartment in Budapest, Hungary, all I could see in my mind are images of babies and little children lying on the dirty floor of Budapest\u0027s railway stations, or a damp field near the border waiting for their transfer to a new, safer and better life.Documentary filmmaker; College Lecturer; Human rights advocateWith Bernie Sanders as nominee, Democrats won\u0027t have to endure endless scandals and defend against real or fabricated controversies. Benghazi might be politically motivated, but the FBI investigation and other scandals are serious. Although Bernie\u0027s success is bolstered primarily by his record and his bold message, Clinton\u0027s issues will help him become the Democratic nominee.Columnist published in The Cleveland Plain Dealer, The Baltimore Sun, The Hill, Salon, The Jerusalem Post www.hagoodman.comWhen you complain productively, you seek to restore effectiveness, trust, and integrity. You confront only once, and you follow through to resolution. At best, you end up with a new agreement that closes the matter.Founder and Chairman, Conscious Business Center InternationalIf I\u0027m not really familiar with Gaga and our interests are probably quite different, what in the world could I possibly have in common with her? The commonality that links me and Lady Gaga is this: We were both raped. And we both seem to find some healing in the telling of our story.Best selling Author, Speaker, and Survivors’ AdvocateProfessor Žižek shares his deep admiration for Malcolm X, whose insights Žižek believes reached the height of contemporary philosophy.PBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorIt seems that quite a few tech items are irking vacationers this year. Travelers claim that the presence of technology and social media over-sharing takes away from the experience as a whole.TravelandLeisure.comUnlike those who\u0027ve taken to social media to express their disgust over Cosmopolitan Magazine\u0027s crowing of the Kardashians as \"America\u0027s First Family,\" I\u0027ve failed to understand the big to-do about the headline on the cover of their November issue. Love or hate them, the Kardashians embody what our country has come to represent to the rest of the world; vanity and excess.Radio host, writer, producerEven given the policy analysis failures of Trump\u0027s positions, other leading Republican contenders for the presidency are far more clearly referring to mental health as an excuse to dodge gun control rather than develop a functional system.Research assistant for the Global Initiative for Civil Society and Conflict.
