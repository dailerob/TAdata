{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Director, Earth Institute at Columbia UniversityThe president is basically saying to the American workers to trust him and the corporate lobbies that are swarming all over the negotiations. Yet this calls to mind the old adage, \"Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.\" Trust might be a little easier except for the rumors of many corporate goodies strewn through the draft agreements: giving foreign investors rights to sue governments; giving the drug companies even more power to gouge consumers; and creating weak and unenforceable standards on labor rights and state-owned enterprises. Fast track puts the politics exactly backward.Would a small change in even one of the fundamental constants cause the whole edifice to crumble? This question, while fundamental, may also seem completely inaccessible.Director of the Origins Project at Arizona State University; Author, \u0027A Universe From Nothing\u0027I\u0027ve seen you cringe just a little when someone says your child is lucky to have you.

Endowed with extraordinary rights and privileges, a free press has a responsibility to own up to its shortcomings in order to avoid repeating them in the future. And Ebola represented a colossal blunder.Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaAmerica\u0027s famed \"containment policy\" vis-à-vis the Soviet Union didn\u0027t just contain that superpower -- it contained us, too. With the Soviet Union gone, the U.S. military was freed from containment. There was nowhere it couldn\u0027t go and nothing it couldn\u0027t do -- or so the top officials of the Bush administration came into power thinking, even before 9/11.Retired lieutenant colonel (USAF)To hire a person to lead a women\u0027s basketball team who was found guilty of sexual harassment seems, at a minimum, to be immensely tone-deaf.

Now, how about your sex toys, where are they?The Emily Posts of the modern bedroomThe idea that we transition reinforces the idea that there is some kind of gender change. It reinforces the idea that at some point in my life, I was a man. It reinforces the exact idea that most significantly creates barriers to bringing about an understanding.Executive Director, Kansas Statewide Transgender Education ProjectIn states that have legalized marriage for gays and lesbians, the only change in those contracts was the genders. A few pronouns were switched, but when gay couples marry, everything else still works exactly the same way.Writer, photographer, explainer of the strange and wonderfulWhen the instruments of death fly above us, we still look up in admiration, not horror.

And when I say I, I mean we.An orphaned-wife-mother-woman living in ChicagoPretty much every time the federal courts hear a case connected to civil rights, voices on the political right can be counted on to say, \"Unelected judges shouldn\u0027t decide this! It should be left to the democratic process!\" That\u0027s a fundamental misreading of the U.S. Constitution and it forces one to overlook some distinctly unpleasant history.Chief Operating Officer, The Greenlining InstituteWhile it is disconcerting that there isn\u0027t a more robust incident response culture out there, perhaps more worrisome is the seeming lack of best practices pointed at heading off the problem before it happens.
