{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarA new study from the London School of Economics found that an increasing number of younger women are choosing to have children earlier, with the idea that they\u0027ll return to, or even start, their careers later on. In a reader poll conducted by the Telegraph, 15 percent of voters said that the best time to have a baby is early on in your career. The argument: It\u0027s easier to leave when you\u0027ve got fewer responsibilities. Of course, those women may feel they are making certain sacrifices. Spending your early 20s as a mother necessarily can mean missing out on, well, your 20s. There are also other factors at play, including romantic and financial and physical ones. As with career, there\u0027s really no one size fits all approach to parenthood. Sometimes a career is in place, but the particular woman just isn\u0027t ready. Or vice versa.Comments (386)Nathan MyhrvoldFormer CTO, MicrosoftUnfortunately, there\u0027s no magic approach to separate the bad crazy ideas from the good crazy ideas, but the good ones do have a few distinguishing characteristics that help us improve our success rate.Comments (83)Bob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowAt every turn, the far-left stupidly undermines its political goals simply because it doesn\u0027t understand the realities of American politics. If perchance I\u0027m wrong, and they do get it, they spend way too much energy trying to reinvent the wheel rather than, you know, winning.Comments (932)Kirk DouglasActorI sat in the driver\u0027s seat and I saw a note on the wheel. I recognized Michael\u0027s handwriting: \"Dad, you always say I never asked you for anything but you gave me a lot. Love, Michael.\" What is the opposite of rejection? Acceptance.Comments (104)Beth KohmDeputy Executive Director, PFLAG NationalAbout six months ago my 6-year-old, Joshua, asked, \"Mom, what is \u0027transgender\u0027?\" I explained as best as I could, but I also said that it\u0027s a very complicated topic that sometimes even grownups struggle with. Joshua thought about it for a moment and then issued his surprising response.Comments (147)Iris HigginsCertified hypnotherapist, past life regression specialist, and women\u0027s health coachI\u0027m sorry because every time you ate something you \"shouldn\u0027t\" or ate more than you \"should,\" I talked about \"getting back on the bandwagon.\" I cringe now every time someone uses that phrase. When did the way we eat become a bandwagon? When did everyone stop eating and become professional dieters?Comments (336)Kal PennActor/ProducerIt was a mistake to try to casually engage in 140 characters with folks who I thought understood my background and beliefs; instead, folks misunderstood this as a strong advocation of something entirely different. I feel terrible about that and am sorry.Comments (158)Tracy McMillanAuthor, TV writerTwo days ago. I just noticed this thing. I can\u0027t believe it took me this long. You know how when something is so right in front of your face, sometimes you can\u0027t even see it? It was like that. And here\u0027s what I noticed: A lot of us ladies don\u0027t want to grow up.Comments (372)Jennifer HarveyAssociate Professor of Religion, Drake UniversityWe don\u0027t assume pat answers are adequate for enabling our children to learn to navigate relationships, nutrition, sexuality, religion, emotions or any other challenging reality. Why should race and racism be any different?Comments (321)James ZogbyPresident, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027The events unfolding across Egypt have all the aspects of a classic tragedy. The characters involved, each in their own way, have demonstrated that they have been unable to rise above their fatal flaws with the result being the horror we are now witnessing.Comments (23)David Katz, M.D.Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterYes, side effects of medications can kill. But so can the side effects of declining medications we really need. When prescribed judiciously by clinicians who know what they are doing to patients who know what they are getting, drugs are far more likely to help than harm.Comments (77)Don BacigalupiPresident, Crystal Bridges Museum of American ArtIn 2011, with the museum still under construction and planning its debut, many in the art world were questioning the viability of an art museum in small town Arkansas.CommentsRalph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorThe post-financial crisis reality is that the dream of owning a home has ended for too many Americans. Looking ahead, it is unfortunate that much of the same flawed thinking that led to the subprime mortgage crisis is now re-occurring.Comments (241)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundOur children are afraid for their friends, their families, and themselves. They know something needs to change. But they can\u0027t get there without us -- and they certainly can\u0027t get there by arming themselves with still more guns.Comments (85)Dr. Bart KnolsMedical entomologistCan we benefit from the high-tech war industry or even the infamous U.S. Star Wars program? Intellectual Ventures\u0027 CEO and Founder Nathan Myhrvold believes we can, by shooting mosquitoes from the sky with laser beams.CommentsArianna HuffingtonIn this week\u0027s issue of the magazine, Kim Bhasin takes a look at some of the ways major clothing brands are excluding plus-size shoppers -- and finally getting called out for it. Elsewhere in the issue, we follow two couples at different stages in life, united by their desire to find a more humane and sustainable definition of success.CommentsCherie BlairFounder, Cherie Blair Foundation for WomenEliminating discrimination against women is a strategy that will move global development progress forward. We will fail to achieve lasting positive change if women are excluded.Comments (107)Jade WalkerOvernight editor and obituary writerOver the course of my 22 years in journalism, I have been threatened numerous times. Sometimes the subjects of my stories didn\u0027t like having their misdeeds aired to the public, and so they lashed out. Sometimes, the people involved were just nuts.Comments (1,047)Danny KennedyFounder, SungevityMr. President, you are finally doing it, and in the process you are making a strong statement to the world. But even as I applaud you, I present you with a question: Why the heck did it take you so long? And more importantly, cannot you do more?Comments (113)Michael ChiarelloChef, TV hostAll good food tells a story. In today\u0027s growing market of regionally driven, artisan products, consumers want to be able to relate to their food; whether it be through a personal connection with the producer or an association with a particular time or place.CommentsSarah Hankel-HoffmanWife and straight allyIt is our lifetime conviction that all people are created equal, and it is our belief that good people subscribe to the \"golden rule\" that has resulted in our decision to withdraw our reservation to hold our wedding reception at the Görtz Haus Gallery in Grimes, Iowa, on Sept. 7, 2013.Comments (684)Theo RandallChef, restaurant ownerThis is a really good way to use spinach in a pasta dish. The cream and egg yolks and parmesan make it rich but the spinach adds great texture and flavour. The shavings of summer truffle make it even more delicious but are not essential.CommentsJonathan WeilerDirector of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel HillCan we please stop talking as if the phrase \"Republican moderate\" has any basis in political reality? Nationally, the GOP has become a party of radicals, proudly wearing on its sleeve its contempt for the less well off and its ignorance of basic scientific reality.Comments (1,209)Ahmed KadryWriter and Commentator on Egypt and the Middle East.Are we to condemn ElBaradei for this apparent hypocrisy, or commend him for his altruism in becoming involved in a process for the greater good of the country that he would otherwise reject?Comments (79)Nathan ManskeFounder and Executive Director, I\u0027m From DriftwoodComments (134)Agapi StassinopoulosAuthor of \u0027Unbinding the Heart\u0027There is an underlying and maybe sometimes not so underlying question, which is in all of us: What is the purpose of my life and what am I here to do? Obviously each one of us has to find our own unique and personal answer to these questions.Comments (75)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureWe\u0027re becoming a financialized economy. Never before has the manipulation of money counted for so much and the real-world economy of people and consumer goods counted for so little. And none of it is an accident.Comments (201)Ann BrenoffSenior Writer, The Huffington PostWe are now living with an entire generation of disinterested store clerks, rude waiters, indifferent cable company operators and medical office staffs who frankly don\u0027t give a damn whether you ever cross their employer\u0027s doorway again. Does Best Buy really wonder why it\u0027s in bankruptcy? (Hint: Shoppers hate you.)Comments (1,192)Abraham H. FoxmanNational Director, Anti-Defamation LeagueThis disturbing similar oppression of the LGBT community in Russia and that of Soviet Jewry should instruct us in how to respond.Comments (33)The Daily MealTheDailyMeal.comThere is no doubt that the classic college bar is a major part of an undergrad\u0027s life. Everyone\u0027s got their favorite campus late-night hangout. But some of these college bars, from universities and colleges big and small, truly define what it means to be a (insert your college mascot here).Comments (13)Doug BandowSenior Fellow, the Cato InstituteThe bloody crackdown in Egypt has clarified events. The military staged a coup.Comments (372)Steven Raichlen, 2013.17.08Judith E. Glaser, 2013.17.08David Paul, 2013.17.08Feisal G.
