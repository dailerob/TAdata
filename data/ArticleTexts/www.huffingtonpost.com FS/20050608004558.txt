{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AriannaOn Sunday, I saw David Hare\u0027s new play, \"Stuff Happens,\" at the Mark Taper Forum in L.A. The play centers on the relationship between Blair and Bush during the lead up to the invasion of Iraq. Time and time again, Hare’s Bush leans on Blair for political cover, and time and time again, Blair gets played by Bush and his team, sacrificing his credibility for empty promises on the Middle East Road Map and on a second U.N. resolution. It is on the prospect of such a resolution that the play sends Cheney into a tailspin, willing to forgo British involvement in Iraq: \"When the cat shit gets bigger than the cat,\" he growls, \"get rid of the cat.\"The trans-Atlantic chums are having a face-to-face in DC today. Wouldn’t it be cool if Blair suddenly located his family jewels and turned today’s press conference into a replay of George Galloway’s smackdown of Sen. Norm Coleman? Y’know: Fed Up Brits Gone Wild!Read More06.07.2005 Gary HartAs co-chair of the U.S. Commission on National Security for the 21st Century, I have been working with several of my colleagues to follow up on how many of our 50 specific recommendations for making America more secure have been adopted and implemented by the Bush administration more than four years after our final report. We know that it took a year and a half, and the 9.11 attacks, for the president finally to accept our pre-9.11 recommendation to create a Department of Homeland Security. But few, if any, of the other 49 recommendations have so-far been adopted.read whole post | permalink06.07.2005 Rep. John ConyersAfter the abject failure of the media to expose the myth of WMD and Iraq, the cheerleading coverage of \"embedded\" reporters, and the transmission of propaganda to the American people (see Jessica Lynch\u0027s \"rescue\", Pat Tillman\u0027s tragic death, and the toppling of Saddam\u0027s statue), aren\u0027t we owed some good, sustained and thorough reporting on the Downing Street Memo?read whole post | permalink | comments06.07.2005 Stephen ElliottGuantanamo, a city state of 10,000 with a high school, McDonalds, Starbucks, roads, and only one purpose, leased from Cuba for $3,500 a year ($2,000 worth of gold in 1903), is supposed to be the place where the really really bad guys go. And there are really really bad guys there, maybe as many as twenty. Fifteen have been designated for trial and four charged with crimes. There are three ways out of Guantanamo. The first is death -- suicide attempts are routine. The second is the court, but death is more likely. The third and best chance is if your country insists its citizens be released. That\u0027s what happened to Mamdouh Habib...read whole post | permalink | comments06.07.2005 Richard BradleyA new Washington Post—ABC News poll finds that \"a clear majority of Americans say President Bush is ignoring the public\u0027s concerns and instead has become distracted by issues that most people say they care little about.\" It\u0027s easy to understand why the public might feel this way. The president has devoted an enormous amount of time to his ideologically-driven crusade to privatize Social Security (big problem, wrong answer). In fact, crusades -- whether they involve Terri Schiavo, judicial nominations, the war against Darwin, or the war in Iraq -- are the hallmark of Bush\u0027s second term.read whole post | permalink | comments06.06.2005 Harry ShearerI have to admit I was stunned to see Richard Ben Veniste of the Watergate prosecutor\u0027s office sitting (virtually) next to G. Gordon Liddy, convicted Watergate felon, to discuss the unmsking of Deep Throat. Did no one ask, \"Are we, by this pair of bookings, declaring a moral equivalency between the prosecutor and the ones he prosecuted?\" What other crime story would get such weirdly even-handed treatment? Can we look forward to Vincent Bugliosi and Susan Atkins side-by-side on Court TV for a leisurely look back at the Charles Manson case?read whole post | permalink | comments06.06.2005 David SirotaClearly the Democratic Party is in the process of making a big decision about its future. Will it follow the likes of Reid, Dean and others and transform itself into a conviction party that is motivated by principles? Or, will it continue in the \"triangulation\" mode with calculated, watered-down positions that continue telling America Democrats simply stand for nothing?read whole post | permalink06.07.2005 Paul KrassnerJust as we now consider barbaric the tradition of human sacrifice by priests at the ancient Inca temples who cut the hearts out of their own innocent worshippers, anthropologists of the future will surely declare that the Supreme Court’s decision on medical marijuana was incredibly inhumane. The war on drugs is really a war on some people who use some drugs.read whole post | permalink | comments06.07.2005 Karen FinleyIn association with Red Bull, Michael Jackson promotes a Soda Wine called Jesus Juice. It is a soft drink wine in a can. But the deal has problems. Red Bull insists that the design be simple, with only the product name, Jesus Juice, in Red and Silver, parodying Coca Cola. Michael prefers to have his face juxtaposed with Jesus as the logo. After careful deliberation a mutual artistic decision is made for the logo: Michael’s silver glove holding the words, Jesus Juice.read whole post | permalink | comments06.06.2005 Gene StoneFor the fruit fly, this is just one more incident of human invasion on its privacy.
