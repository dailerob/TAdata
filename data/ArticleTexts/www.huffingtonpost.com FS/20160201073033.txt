{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Trump frightens the Republican elite both because he is uninformed and unpredictable, but also because he is in many respects the least conservative of the conservatives. He doesn\u0027t hate government and he doesn\u0027t have much use for Wall Street and free trade. But the Trump program, to the extent that he has one, doesn\u0027t address the deeper causes of working class rage. The Sanders voters tend to be younger, more driven by hope than by anger, and painfully aware that their generation has gotten the short end of the stick -- costly college loans, too few real jobs with career tracks, unaffordable housing, and a generational fable about how cool it is to live in a world defined by Facebook, Uber, Starbucks and Airbnb, even if incomes are low and unreliable. Maybe you\u0027ll invent a killer app, but maybe you won\u0027t. Will that be for here or to go? These problems are not going away -- they are only deepening. And nothing on offer in mainstream politics is likely to fix them.FDR\u0027s presidency ended in 1980 with the election of Ronald Reagan, and Reagan has ruled ever since. As we face another potentially epoch-shifting presidential election, perhaps we would do well to remember that last one.Karl N. Llewellyn Professor of Jurisprudence and Director of the Center for Law, Philosophy and Human Values at the University of ChicagoIn a new report, \"How the Sanders Social Security is Not Progressive,\" Third Way is warning the electorate that Sanders is coddling the rich. Sanders, who daily attacks the \"billionaire class,\" is proposing to benefit the rich at the expense of the rest of us? Sound preposterous? That is because it is. Let\u0027s examine the facts.Founding Co-director, Social Security WorksA bunch of people seem to be saying that it doesn\u0027t matter for policy outcomes if Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton is elected President. The rough claim seems to be: Republicans are going to control the House anyway, if not the Senate, so a Democratic President won\u0027t be able to do anything anyway.Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicyI think we need to change the phrase \"breed like rabbits\" to \"breed like humans,\" as no other species on this planet even comes close to the human reproduction rate. As our population grows, available land shrinks and more and more people are forced to live in crowded, urbanized environments, a situation ripe for the easy spread and emergence of infectious agents.Neurologist, public health specialist, authorThe Koch brothers\u0027 donor retreats are notoriously secretive affairs, but after my publishing of several hours of audio from their 2014 summer confab, the network began to bring select journalists behind its closed doors. With strings attached.Executive Producer, The Undercurrent (www.youtube.com/tytinvestigates)COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- During the cartoon crisis of 2006, an association with European xenophobia and Islamophobia had grave consequences for Denmark\u0027s international diplomacy and its exposure to international terrorism. Now, its new migrant law threatens to do the same.Senior researcher, Danish Institute for International StudiesVanden Heuvel explains her ardor for Bernie while Cooke still thinks it\u0027ll be Marco. What a country -- an old Jewish socialist against a young Cuban neo-con? But after Obama, nothing\u0027s impossible. Panel agrees on one thing -- that Trump is entertaining, ignorant and an ugly disgrace.Host, \u0027Both Sides Now\u0027Trump and Cruz are the GOP\u0027s textbook Catch-22. One of them figures as a real possibility for the presidential nomination. For GOP leaders to not support them almost guarantees a flaming Election Day defeat. But to support them could mean the same.Author and political analystAL-ZARQA, Jordan -- In the beginning, I completely believed that people should go after their freedom, even if the process involves violence. But from time to time I think to myself, is it worth all the losses and the innocent lives? Is it worth destroying a whole country and its history?Spanish and English Languages Recent Graduate, University of JordanKrugman is one of the few prominent writers on economic and political issues who has, on a number of occasions, admitted when he was mistaken, and forthrightly changed his position. I hope that he will reconsider his ideas in this case.Co-director, Center for Economic and Policy Research, Washington, D.C.The real debate Democrats should be having should not be about whether single payer, a highly successful proven system in so many industrialized nations, is the solution, but rather how we can collectively come together to overcome the corporate forces that derailed the ACA from providing a public option, drug price controls and insurance rate regulationPhysician, Executive Chairman of the Courage Campaign, Healthcare ActivistHow candidates for high office speak about the Middle East should be a critical test of their capacity to lead our nation. I have listened attentively to all of the Republican and Democratic Party debates and have been deeply disturbed. I am most troubled by what I hear on the Republican side.President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027Zika virus (Zv) infects people via daytime mosquitoes carrying it, and rarely via sex with infected partners. Mosquitoes can bite infected people and then bite others, transmitting Zv to new people.Biologist and authorWal-Mart\u0027s high profile as America\u0027s largest employer makes its wage decisions particularly important. Wal-Mart has a singular opportunity to lead on the improvement of wages and schedules, setting a higher floor for workers who deserve better.WriterSenior Policy Analyst at DemosFor those Illinois Democrats who have been trusting in Hillary Clinton\u0027s skirt tails as the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee to help sweep Illinois House and Senate Democratic incumbents back into office and to perhaps topple some GOP lawmakers, uh, knock it off.Public Relations Consultant, Ex-Press Secretary, Democratic Party of IllinoisBut what does it say about the United States if its citizens are afraid to vote for a candidate because they don\u0027t believe their government will allow the leader of the free world to address the biggest domestic problems it faces?Radio/Podcast Producer \u0026 Host at WGN Radio, ChicagoA study found that the percentage of Hispanic actors onscreen increased from 6.6 percent before the merger to 7.3 percent afterward. That\u0027s good news, right? Well, even that mild improvement comes with a caveat. Basically, more shows were hiring more Hispanics to appear as servants and thugs. Yay for progress!The Hispanic FanaticPresident Obama called upon America to make computer science \"a basic skill, right along with the three \u0027Rs.\u0027\" He pointed out that nine out of ten parents want it taught at their children\u0027s schools, \"yet right now, only about a quarter of our K through 12 schools offer computer science.\"Technology journalistI\u0027m going to share some negative habits that will kill your chances of living the life of your dreams. If you\u0027re exhibiting any of these, it\u0027s time to reevaluate your actions and make steps towards changing them.Lifelong learner and wannabe philosopher.

Intelligent and talented women of color, like my mother, make up nearly one third of the nation\u0027s workforce, but when compared to white women, they are twice as likely to be employed in lower-wage sectors.a rebelde in techGrit is as rare as it is important. The good news is any of us can get grittier with a little extra focus and effort.Author of #1 bestselling book, Emotional Intelligence 2.0, and president of TalentSmart, world\u0027s leading provider of emotional intelligence.Sanders\u0027 mass appeal, big crowds and enthusiasm in spite of a virtual media blackout shows that America has grown up a lot since 1972. Thanks to the Internet, we are able to communicate past media manipulation and organize.Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureI\u0027ve had a lot of jobs in a lot of places-- hip coffee shop barista, downtown executive assistant, nursing home activities director, and most recently, full-time mama to one fiery little red-headed boy.Hope-hungry mama wielding words until the world changes. ashleyabramson.comYou may find when you go to caucus on Monday you will stand with others in your community and help make Hillary Clinton the nominee of the Democratic Party.non-profit consultant, public speaker and political activistSummer isn\u0027t the only season we crave healthy, delicious salads.

Today, competition between young athletes is greater than ever, with specialization (it seems) occurring at a much younger age.Sports Media ProfessionalTwo weeks ago I turned 50. I wondered if I would wake up suddenly wiser, or with osteoporosis, but 50 felt no different than 49 -- which is true of most milestone birthdays. Do you remember turning 10? Of course not.
