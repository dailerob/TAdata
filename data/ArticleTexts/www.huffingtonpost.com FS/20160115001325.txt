{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Professor of international relations, George Washington UniversityLarge segments of the public, on the right and on the left, the Trumplings and the Sandernistas, are angry not because the government did not properly stuff their Christmas stocking. They have many good, and quite a few far from good, reasons to be very angry. They are the people who lost their homes, a good part of their life savings, and jobs during the recent Great Recession. Those who got new jobs are paid much less and receive fewer benefits. And for each one who was directly screwed by the system, there are a dozen family members and friends who did a bit better but empathize with those who did not. Offering them a few goodies will not do. What must be done is to redirect their anger to the proper address.Four years ago, Donald Trump, a Penn graduate, who routinely tells crowds how smart he is, rightly demanded that President Obama release his transcripts.

The reason is simple: the Arab and Turkmen Islamist groups are the main bulwark against the expansion of the de facto autonomous Kurdish enclave in northern Syria. Thus, Erdogan tries hard after each ISIS attack to create a \"generic\" threat of terrorism in which all groups are bundled up together without any clear references to ISIS. He is trying to present the PKK as enemy number one.Senior fellow, Brookings Institution; Professor of National Security Strategy, U.S. National War CollegeBlack girls and women, are enough. That our lives and our pain matter, that we don\u0027t have to work and cook and clean and fight and give until we are mentally emotionally and physically bankrupt.

I\u0027m subconsciously biased in a hundred and one ways. I\u0027m lacking in conscientiousness. But at least when it comes to global poverty, I will not, I cannot, just stand by.bookworm, alleged human, wannabe data scientist and aspiring effective altruist.Two threats endanger humankind: nuclear weapons and global warming. These same threats also enhance our awareness that all of us are members of a single species. That enhanced awareness might well be the most important outcome of the recent Paris climate meetings.Author, \u0027Witness to an Extreme Century: A Memoir\u0027 and \u0027The Nazi Doctors: Medical Killing and the Psychology of Genocide\u0027Fifteen years ago I gave up the responsibilities of commuting to work, sitting in a desk chair and wearing \"real\" pants, to stay home with my oldest daughter.
