{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Director of Economic Policy, Roosevelt Institute, NewDeal2.0We\u0027ve been hearing a lot lately about the possibility of a double-dip recession. I do not know if we will actually go to a double dip or just substandard growth given the high level of underutilized human resources. But that is beside the point. It is a very sad feeling, one that I had during the aftermath of Katrina, when the government reveals that it does not intend to respond to a crisis. It is a cold, dehumanized feeling.

Training a pilot takes two to five years, so I guess it makes sense. But will the American people have the stomach for that?Read Post | CommentsRobert Reich, 08.19.2010Former Secretary of Labor, Professor at BerkeleyThe U.S. has pledged $150 million to Pakistan\u0027s flood victims while we\u0027ve spent over $100 billion this year on military maneuvers to defeat the Taliban in Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan. This is bizarre and shameful.Read Post | CommentsJoe Lapointe, 08.19.2010Sports JournalistClemens acted as if he could bully Congress the way he could intimidate hitters with fastballs. But perhaps the public revulsion toward cheaters and liars will help to make him the fall guy for a tainted era.Read Post | CommentsDerrick Crowe, 08.19.2010Political Director, Brave New FoundationThere is virtually no data that shows strategically significant security \"progress\" in Afghanistan since the start of the latest escalation.Read Post | CommentsRashad Robinson, 08.19.2010Senior Director of Media Programs, GLAADThe First Amendment protects her freedom of speech in a court of law.

Dennis Kucinich, 08.19.2010U.S. House RepresentativeWho is in charge of our operations in Iraq, now? George Orwell? A war based on lies continues to be a war based on lies. Today, we have a war that is not a war, with combat troops who are not combat troops.Read Post | CommentsMJ Rosenberg, 08.19.2010Senior Foreign Policy Fellow, Media Matters Action NetworkFox News, the Christian Broadcasting Network, and other media outlets have been broadcasting anti-Muslim hate non-stop for going on a month now.Read Post | CommentsJesse Kornbluth, 08.19.2010Editor of HeadButler.comAt Rumi\u0027s funeral, Christians proclaimed, \"He was our Jesus!\" while Jews cried, \"He was our Moses!\" Both were right. It makes perfect sense that this 13th century Muslim is now said to be the best-selling poet in 21st century America.Read Post | CommentsRyan Reynolds, 08.19.2010ActorYou don\u0027t have to make a personal trip to the Gulf of Mexico to realize the BP disaster has blown the cover off a subject some would prefer to keep quiet: the ongoing damage inflicted by our addiction to oil.Read Post | CommentsEric Schwartz and Susan Reichle, 08.19.2010What conclusions can we draw from the recent proliferation of humanitarian crises?

MacArthur, 08.19.2010President and Publisher, Harper\u0027s MagazineNext time you hear a politician or journalist try to justify the reckless stupidity of the Afghan war by invoking human rights or international law, try to imagine how the local citizens might feel if British soldiers were patrolling American streets.Read Post | CommentsDoug Noll, 08.19.2010Lawyer turned peacemakerThere is no easy way out of Afghanistan. The problem starts with India and Pakistan and ends only if peace can be found between them.Read Post | CommentsJeffrey Feldman, 08.19.2010Author of Framing The Debate and Outright Barbarous, Founder of Frameshop blogWhy would one of the most powerful figures in the American Catholic clergy step into the anti-Muslim hysteria waving a lie?
