{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, the political fallout of Justice Scalia\u0027s death continued. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wasted no time declaring that, even with eleven months left in Obama\u0027s presidency, \"this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.\" President Obama pledged to fulfill his \"constitutional responsibilities\" by making a nomination, and called on the Senate to \"fulfill its responsibility to give that person a fair hearing and a timely vote.\" Jeb Bush broke with Republican orthodoxy and said he would \"probably nominate\" someone, and John Kasich said he\u0027d nominate someone if he were president (while saying Obama, who is the president, shouldn\u0027t). What\u0027s amazing isn\u0027t only how dysfunctional our system has become, but how openly that dysfunction is now proclaimed. And how much we\u0027ve come to accept it as the new normal. And that seems likely to continue, until we make our leaders pay a price for not actually leading.Sadly, too often, the stigma around mental health prevents people who need help from seeking it. But that simply doesn\u0027t make any sense. Whether an illness affects your heart, your arm or your brain, it\u0027s still an illness, and there shouldn\u0027t be any distinction.First Lady of The United StatesThe movement for Black lives must consider the bodies whom are always left behind in the quest for Black liberation: Black fat bodies, Black femme bodies, Black disabled bodies, Black stripper bodies, Black hoe bodies, Black HIV Positive Bodies, Black gender deviant bodies, Black poor bodies, Black unconventional bodies, Black depressed bodies, and Black malnourished bodies.Multidisciplinary performance artist and cultural worker living in Bed-Stuy, BrooklynHe said: \"I\u0027m sending up the Bat Signal for you. We miss you, we need you?--?the old you, the political you?--?especially now, as the nation faces nothing less than a crisis of democracy.\" She said: \"I\u0027m just talking about politics in a different way and from a different angle. This is certainly an unconventional election, and it needs more than conventional coverage.\"Author, \u0027Public Parts\u0027 and \u0027What Would Google Do?\u0027Author, \u0027Public Parts\u0027 and \u0027What Would Google Do?\u0027It is such a privilege to have this opportunity to be Guest Editor of the Huffington Post today, and to celebrate the amazing work being done to improve and understand the mental health of young children.

I don\u0027t know if the damage will ever go away. But I do know that I have grown, gained new perspective, and a deeper understanding of the lessons my mom instilled in me as a young girl: to believe in the power of truth and staying true to yourself.VP of Engineering for Personalization, Mobile and Content at YahooI am someone who has struggled with mental health issues since I was a teen. From the outside, many would not see my pain nor be able to relate to the sometimes-daily struggle I was facing. It would have appeared as though I had grasped the world with both hands. This is part of the deception of depression and also mental illness: what may appear at face value is a stark difference from the agony that lies within.Australia\u0027s most decorated OlympianThe evidence shows that more women in leadership roles often means better performance. As more organizations come to understand that, we can hope that they will increasingly put women in those roles. It\u0027s simply good intelligence.Fmr. CIA covert operations officerThey did the exact right thing by not complying with the order. They are exactly right that this is a very, very slippery slope. And while the FBI is attempting to be very clear that this is a one-off request, there is no chance that it is.Owner, Dallas Mavericks; Chairman, AXS TVThe work to free Black political prisoners is the work to free us all, and it continues, even as we lift up every victory achieved along the way. Which we should do because it\u0027s these victories that provide us the will to go on when our backs are weary and our hearts are taxed.Award-Winning Author and JournalistDonald Trump has never met a wall he doesn\u0027t love. He believes in border walls, in gated communities, in structures and policies that separate \"us\" from \"them\" -- especially when \"them\" can be defined as immigrants or people of color or the poor.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersImagine a world where you will never be treated as your correct gender by any government agency. What ID you have will constantly out you as transgender, inviting discrimination -- perfectly legal discrimination, if part two of Family Research Council\u0027s plan succeeds.Director of Advocacy, SPARTAAs the President has said, Cuba will not change overnight, nor will all of the various differences between our countries go away. But the guiding principle of our Cuba policy -- our North Star -- remains taking steps that will improve the lives of the Cuban people.Assistant to the President and Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications and SpeechwritingThe country\u0027s polarization between \"black lives matter\" and \"all lives matter\" and the pundits\u0027 divergent opinions on Beyoncé\u0027s Super Bowl halftime performance parallel the racial divide we saw in the aftermath of the Simpson trial.Professor, Thomas Jefferson School of LawDear Mr. President, please appoint Elizabeth Warren to the Supreme Court before the end of the week. She\u0027s earned it. She deserves it. And she\u0027ll be so, so good at it.U.S. Congressman for Florida\u0027s 9th DistrictThis whole \"having it all\" business has been grossly misinterpreted by our society at large. The purpose of all that bra burning back in the \u002760s was to give women choices. Doing all of it at the same time was never the idea.Print and radio reporter, co-host of Range PodcastUltimately, deep down, no matter the candidate, the fact is there is only one true issue here in these United States. As a banker says in The Mark and the Void, Paul Murray\u0027s recent novel, \"What\u0027s the one reliable area of growth in the twenty-first century? Inequality.\" Now let the booing commence.Senior writer, BillMoyers.com. Former senior writing fellow, Demos.

To the Internet trolls, I say have several seats and bask in this #BlackGirlMagic.Executive Fashion And Beauty Editor, The Huffington PostWith a long and well documented trail of corrupt practices that continue to unfold by the day, it is disheartening, but not surprising, that over the course of the past few weeks, a credible theory has emerged that the upcoming election for the FIFA President will be no more than mere window dressing for pre-cooked backroom deals among the old FIFA guard.Former President, East Timor, 1996 Nobel Peace Prize laureateImagine the Supreme Court deciding more than 100 cases without its full complement of nine Justices. Imagine this closely divided Court splitting 4-4 in many of those cases, meaning that it cannot issue a decision that provides binding law for the whole country.Chief Counsel, Constitutional Accountability CenterThere was always enough of a Republican Party to do important tasks of governance -- to span the divides, give force and expression to a set of core beliefs, and come up with a candidate around whom Party regulars could enthusiastically rally. No longer. And that\u0027s a huge problem for the rest of us.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027The personality extremes associated with entrepreneurship often aren\u0027t all that different from those associated with mental illness, especially bipolar disorder and depression.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarThe Virginia Governor invited the NRA to the table, but not gun violence prevention experts, and it shows.Executive Director, Coalition to Stop Gun ViolenceI have no regrets about the child I didn\u0027t have and find myself happy and satisfied with my life. I had advantages that women generations before me didn\u0027t have -- education, economic independence and, most importantly, I was able to exercise a right that until then wasn\u0027t available to women.Lawyer with the Law Offices of Amy Oppenheimer and a retired administrative law judge for the State of CaliforniaThe Catholic Church constructs barriers while speaking in doublespeak saying \"we love you,\" \"we welcome you,\" \"we offer you \u0027Christian love,\u0027\" and \"we are here to help you change your unwanted attractions and gender identities and expressions.\"Independent Writerknow these are just a few of the lessons I will continue to learn as I progress forward as a survivor. I\u0027m so thankful that support groups for survivors exist and the wonderful survivor friends I have made over the years who have helped reveal some of these teachings to me. Being a survivor of suicide is a title I never expected I\u0027d bear, but I\u0027m finding my way through this grief journey little by little.Publicist, marketing strategist and co-founder of OurSideofSuicide.com.I got a chance to meet Justice Antonin Scalia, the most homophobic force on the Supreme Court for more than a quarter of a century, last year. It was just a few days before the historic arguments in the Obergefell case that would bring marriage equality to the entire nation. And it was pretty brilliant.Queer Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostSo many Black and Brown lives; Black and Brown love; and Black and Brown families are in muddled in the mayhem of incarceration. Incarceration has become a family member. Incarceration is a new surname in so many families of color in the United States.Founder and chief re-imaginator of The Precedential GroupToday the public has been notified that the battle is coming; the timing of Scalia\u0027s death in an election year has ensured it.
