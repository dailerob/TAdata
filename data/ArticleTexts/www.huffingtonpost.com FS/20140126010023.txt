{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jason LinkinsEditor, Eat the PressState of the Union addresses are mostly useless. The pageantry is nice, and the speech itself provides adequate fodder for pundits to offer pseudo-analysis, but that\u0027s about it. Nia-Malika Henderson and Felicia Sonmez got it right in 2013 when they described the state of the State of the Union address as \"rarely\" moving \"public opinion\" and just as infrequently leading \"to the kind of broad legislative accomplishments that presidents propose.\" \"For all the ritual and attention surrounding these speeches,\" they write, \"the State of the Union is, well, sort of lame.\" Pretty much! That said, if you really want to get deep into the world of rapidly diminishing returns, allow me to offer something even lamer: the now-traditional \"response\" or \"rebuttal\" to the State of the Union presented by the opposition party immediately following the president\u0027s oration. These might be the lamest political exercises in America.Comments (121)Richard (RJ) EskowSenior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host, Take Action NewsWhat do you give a Wall Street CEO who supervised a unit that lost $6 billion through incompetent and illegal trading, and whose reign of mismanagement has cost his institution $20 billion in the last year -- a figure that would\u0027ve been much larger in a less morally compromised regulatory environment? If you\u0027re the Board of Directors of JPMorgan Chase, you give him a raise.Comments (27)TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"Having \"the talk\" with her 8-year-old daughter was awkward enough. Then they decided to look up cats mating on the Internet, and soon actress and author Julia Sweeney was an inch away from showing her daughter porn. Don\u0027t miss the hilarious (and heartwarming) results.Comments (12)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarCelebrity is a narcissistic business. Since Bieber entered the business, his career has grown at the hands of music executives who stood to make a profit on his popularity, not his mental health.Comments (20)Kumi NaidooExecutive Director, Greenpeace InternationalEven faced with weakening demand prospects, outdated investment patterns are driving fossil fuel companies to waste trillions of dollars in developing reserves and infrastructure that will be stranded as the world moves beyond 20th century energy.Comments (120)Kate QuickMother, writer, professorI was an adjunct English professor in Alaska with a baby due. If I needed to take maternity leave, it would be unpaid. But the choice that I faced -- either care for my newborn or go broke -- was never really a choice. At 27, I was a college professor on food stamps.Comments (264)James MooreBest selling author, TV political analystThe right has portrayed Davis as an ambitious shrew who left her first child with a non-biological father to run off to Harvard, used him to pay for most of her education, and then dumped him the day her law degree was paid in full. This is nowhere near accurate. Regardless, how could they not see this coming down Congress Avenue?Comments (20)Moisés NaímSenior Associate, Carnegie’s International Economics ProgramThe crisis of power is troubling, especially when it comes to tackling some of the world\u0027s most serious threats. There are a great -- and mounting -- number of issues that require collective international action.CommentsScarlett JohanssonActressWhile I never intended on being the face of any social or political movement, distinction, separation or stance as part of my affiliation with SodaStream, given the amount of noise surrounding that decision, I\u0027d like to clear the air.CommentsChristine PelosiChair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusPresident Obama commendably convened a task force to address the rampant rape and sexual assault incidents that are \"an affront to our basic decency and humanity.\" Herewith from my 20 years in advocacy for women and children are my suggestions for the council.CommentsNicholas ThompsonWriterDark roast is terrible in more ways than one. Sorry folks. Your oily, burnt French and Italian roasts are the antithesis of what today\u0027s coffee should be. It\u0027s not your fault that you\u0027ve been told to enjoy this stuff for so long.Comments (761)Doug BandowSenior Fellow, the Cato InstituteWashington has proved impotent in the face of political revolution, Islamist activism, and military repression. Terrorism is accelerating, and Egypt is likely to end up without stability, liberty, democracy, or prosperity. America should disengage from a crisis which it helped create but has no ability to resolve.Comments (54)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundFifty years after President Lyndon Johnson declared a War on Poverty, the United States is still not a fair playing field for millions of children afflicted by preventable poverty, hunger, homelessness, sickness, poor education and violence in the world\u0027s richest economy with a gross domestic product (GDP) of $15.7 trillion.Comments (101)Wadah KhanfarJournalist; President, Sharq ForumThe events of the past decades have been a reflection of the interests of the superpowers and the balance of global politics. The past few years have proven that the Middle East\u0027s dependence on international powers is no longer fruitful.Comments (29)Claire McCarthy, M.D.Pediatrician, Boston Children\u0027s Hospital, Harvard Medical SchoolNobody wants to talk to their kids about sex. Nobody wants to think about their kids having sex--the same way nobody likes to think about their parents having sex. As biologically unlikely as it might be, we\u0027d prefer to think that ours is the only generation that has ever or will ever have sex.CommentsSen. Charles E. SchumerDemocratic U.S. Senator from New YorkIt\u0027s time we deal with the reality that, for the first time in American history, middle-class American incomes have declined for almost a generation. If middle-class incomes continue to decline, we will have a dramatically different America, a less optimistic, more sour America.Comments (128)Belkys LopezAdvisor, DisasterAid USA; Governance and Peacebuilding SpecialistSouth Sudanese women are intricately woven into a social and political fabric that has become increasingly more vulnerable to conflict. War and security are assumed to be the domain of men, while women are cast as the victims.CommentsFrank VoglAuthor, \u0027Waging War on Corruption - Inside the Movement Fighting the Abuse of Power\u0027If Wall Street is deaf to the big fines, then do not expect it to listen to the criticisms and the protests that inevitably will be all over the liberal political media in coming days, replete with tough talk from prominent politicians.Comments (28)Chris WeigantPolitical writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comWill 2014 (or perhaps 2016) become known as the \"Year Of The Marijuana Voter\"? This question can now be seriously asked, because the issue of radically reforming marijuana laws seems to be growing bigger and more imperative with each passing week.CommentsSiddharth Chatterjee and David EvangelistaFamilies are faced with the unthinkable: Caring for their children with intellectual disabilities, or caring for the entire family\u0027s future. Sadly, mothers and families are told, and shown, that they cannot have both.CommentsMichael RothPresident, Wesleyan UniversityDespite their many differences, we can see in Jefferson and the Obamas a common commitment to a broad, open-ended education as a vehicle for disrupting entrenched elites. When the best educational resources are dominated by the wealthiest, they become an elite bent on cultivating their pleasures rather than on extending knowledge and cultural vitality.CommentsFelix MarquardtFounder, The Atlantic DinnersTo the contrary, following President Francois Hollande\u0027s historic embrace of social democracy in a major policy speech last week, there is reason to believe that the French have finally found their way.CommentsJoe CirincionePresident, Ploughshares Fund; Author, \u0027Nuclear Nightmares: Securing the World Before It Is Too Late\" (forthcoming, Fall 2013)Perhaps we need 50 or even 100 nuclear weapons. To be safe, perhaps we keep an active stockpile of 450 nuclear weapons, as nuclear experts recommended in a 2012 study. We have 5,000 today.CommentsJohn FefferCo-director, Foreign Policy In FocusThe latest violence in Iraq rivals the levels last seen during wartime. Last year, between 8,000 and 10,000 civilians were killed, the highest number since 2008.CommentsArianna HuffingtonThe launch of The WorldPost comes at a time when the hunger for an expanded global conversation is stronger than ever.Comments (94)Paul PolmanCEO, UnileverPermissible growth in the future has to be based on sustainable and equitable models. Having acquired a license to operate, it\u0027s time for business to earn a license to lead.Comments (22)Walter IsaacsonPresident and CEO, Aspen InstituteInnovation is wonderful, but on its own it\u0027s not the holy grail. Other things matter just as much in creating a great company or product, most notably execution and focus. Apple excels at these things. That\u0027s why I use an iPhone and iPad. Innovation without execution produces footnotes to history, such as the Xerox Alto and Star.Comments (22)J.D. RothmanBlogger, www.TheNeuroticParent.comOnce college applications are completed, high school seniors enter a lull period, an interminable limbo, worsened by the pressure to keep their grades up. These months can be even more terrible for parents, who need to remain cheery even though they can no longer \"make things right\" for their kids.CommentsJohn OnaiyekanCardinal and Roman Catholic Archbishop of AbujaThe question of values in leadership boils down to why people seek leadership positions in the first place.CommentsMichael S. Broder, Ph.D.Psychologist; Author, \u0027Stage Climbing: The Shortest Path to Your Highest Potential\u0027Arguably, the most important thing to remember is what has long-term implications. Trust is a fragile commodity and is easily damaged. Always assume that they will \"fact check\" you in some way. It may not be right away, but inevitably, the topic -- whatever it is -- will come up at some point with their siblings, cousins, friends or teachers.CommentsJeff BogleBlogger, Out With The Kids \u0026 Good Men ProjectDid you spy the wicked grille up there, junior? How \u0027bout them sweet curves on the rear taillights, young whippersnapper? Word. That\u0027s how I roll.CommentsBob Lotich, 2014.25.01James Zogby, 2014.25.01Elisa Villanueva Beard, 2014.25.01Gurjot Kaur, 2014.25.01Kristian Schwartz, 2014.25.01Bianca Bosker, 2014.25.01Muqtedar Khan, 2014.25.01Feisal G.
