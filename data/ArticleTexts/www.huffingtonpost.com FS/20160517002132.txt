{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoLast month, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in United States v. Texas, a lawsuit brought by 26 states challenging President Obama’s immigration policies. The case deals specifically with the constitutionality of the president’s “deferred action” program for undocumented immigrants who are law-abiding parents of American citizens. Roughly four million people could qualify under the program, which would allow them to remain in the United States for three years and to apply for work authorization, on a renewable basis. At the heart of the case is a question about the permissible scope of executive discretion. When the president executes federal laws, to what extent can he interpret and implement them in a manner consistent with his own policy objectives?When the challenges come, I hope you remember that anchored deep within you is the ability to learn and grow.
