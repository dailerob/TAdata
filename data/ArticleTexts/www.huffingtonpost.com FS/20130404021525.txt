{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna Huffington\"Our life together can be better.\" That\u0027s the opening sentence of an important new book by Jim Wallis called On God\u0027s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn\u0027t Learned About Serving the Common Good. Wallis wrote it while taking a three-month sabbatical last year, in the midst of the 2012 election -- a break that allowed him to get a broader perspective on what was going on in American public life. The book draws inspiration from Abraham Lincoln\u0027s famous line: \"[M]y concern is not whether God is on our side; my greatest concern is to be on God\u0027s side...\" For Wallis, the key to being on God\u0027s side is a focus on the common good. But, as Wallis saw vividly during his sabbatical, that doesn\u0027t seem to be the direction things are currently headed in our country. Instead of strengthening our commitment to equality, social justice, and our sense of unity as a nation, our public and political discourse is breaking us apart.Comments (171)Jim CarreyActorHow shallow do they think I am? I would trade my money, my fame, my reputation and legacy if there were the slightest chance of preventing the anguish of another Columbine, Virginia Tech, Aurora, or Sandy Hook Elementary School.

Schroeck, 04.03.2013Partner/Vice President, Global Information Management Foundation Leader IBM Business Analytics and Optimization, Global Business ServicesWhat is so new about big data, the tech buzzword that is attracting so much attention these days After all, plenty of organizations -- from global telecommunications companies to stock exchanges -- have been handling and sifting though massive amounts of data for years. But it\u0027s not until recently that three important trends are converging to usher in a new era of big data -- one that will fundamentally transform how businesses operate and how they engage with customers, suppliers, partners, and employees.Read Post | CommentsJohn KerryU.S. Secretary of StateThrough the expansion of the War Crimes Rewards Program, the Department of State is offering up to $5 million for information that leads to the arrest, transfer, and conviction of the top three leaders of the LRA: Joseph Kony, Okot Odhiambo, and Dominic Ongwen.Comments (102)Chelsea ClintonSpecial correspondent, NBC NewsAcross gender lines, intelligence exists in equal supply. But in far too many places, opportunity does not. Lost potential especially abounds in the asymmetrical landscape of science, technology, engineering, and math.Comments (487)Erica HillCo-Anchor, NBC News’ Weekend TODAYReclaiming my sleep made me realize how much I was giving up when I let the exhaustion win, and how much there is to gain in letting go and listening to my body. I\u0027ve finally awakened to the world around me and all it was trying to offer.CommentsGrover NorquistPresident, Americans for Tax ReformThe IRS has one job, and one job only -- to collect taxes. It measures its success or failure in its ability to collect as much in taxes as possible. To ask the IRS to estimate the tax liability of a taxpayer is akin to asking an alcoholic how much they can have without crossing the line -- the answer will always be \"more.\"Comments (456)Debra MacleodRelationship expert and couples’ mediatorPeople often say that their marriage ended because their spouse had an affair; however, infidelity isn\u0027t always the cause of marital breakdown. Usually, it\u0027s a symptom of a relationship that is already unhealthy and unhappy in some way. Here are 8 tips to affair-proof your marriage.Comments (49)Amb. Marc GinsbergFmr. U.S. Ambassador to Morocco \u0026 White House Middle East AdviserIt would be prudent for those who assert that Kim Jong-Un is merely spreading his military wings in a peacock-like manifestation of fancy to realize that that responding to his rhetorical and comical displays is counterproductive.Comments (31)Jonathan WeilerDirector of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel HillAs people tried to make sense of why he thought it was OK for a documented serial abuser to keep coaching young athletes at Rutgers, Rutgers athletic director Tim Pernetti dissembled, side-stepped and evaded both responsibility and the truth.Comments (16)DJ Louie XIVDJThe debate about Tyler that is raging this week, and the fact that I really like Wolf, has me reflecting on my own complicated relationship with homophobia in hip-hop.Comments (17)Susan StiffelmanFamily therapist, Author, Parenting Without Power StrugglesChildren live in the moment. They are largely motivated by either avoiding pain or experiencing pleasure. This is why telling kids that too much sugar will give them cavities has little impact on their decision to swipe that handful of brownies; the enjoyment outweighs later costs.Comments (24)Bevis LongstrethFormer SEC CommissionerPolitical leaders uniformly give lip service to \u0027capitalism\u0027 as being the bed-rock principle on which our great nation rests. But careful examination of what our leaders have actually done, and are actually doing, when not boasting or fundraising, may lead one to different conclusions.Comments (171)Valerie JarrettSenior Advisor and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsSupporting small businesses and entrepreneurs has been a priority for President Obama since Day One of his administration. Why? Because he knows small businesses are responsible for creating two out of every three new jobs in the United States.Comments (168)Katharine McKinneyFreelance writer and bloggerBreastfeeding whenever, wherever a child is hungry is an integral component of breastfeeding success. To take that away is to inhibit mothers who only want to do right by their child.Comments (471)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; host, \u0027The Breakdown\u0027; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureThe Long Depression isn\u0027t hitting us all at once.

SmithChair, Appellate and Supreme Court Practice, Jenner \u0026 BlockDuring the Supreme Court arguments in the Proposition 8 case last week, there seemed to be some confusion about the social science evidence concerning same-sex parents and their ability to raise children, but there is no \"disagreement\" among the experts about what the research says.Comments (11)Kathleen TrenskePhotographerToday, a lot of couples think just getting the disc of wedding images is \"good enough.\" Here\u0027s the problem with that thinking: it\u0027s not true. Not by a long shot.Comments (214)John HennessyAuthor, \"Coney Island Pilgrims\"The fact of Proust\u0027s poems will be news to many, the number and quality of them yet another surprise. Astonishing to virtually all of us, though, comes the revelation that Proust spent much of his life trying to decide whether he was a poet or a prose writer.CommentsShelley EmlingEditor, Post 50Ask for a raise, get around a foreign country, open a bottle of champagne and much more.Comments (214)Jason PinterBestselling thriller writerCurrent Princeton women, please, do not fail yourselves, and do not take for granted the opportunities that people (like me) never had the chance to experience. Find a Princeton man. Make him yours.Comments (15)Michael B. KeeganPresident, People for the American WaySanford\u0027s own experience, you would think, would make him a natural ally of anyone whose unconventional love story has been the object of public scrutiny. Yet, when it comes to gays and lesbians, the former governor\u0027s allegiance lies with the Republican right wing.Comments (36)Al NormanFounder, Sprawl-BustersTwo of the richest families on the planet -- the Waltons and the Buffetts -- have taken public welfare from taxpayers to help clean up a contaminated land that will soon sprout a Wal-Mart superstore.Comments (58)Robert L. BorosagePresident, Institute for America\u0027s FutureThe faltering jobless recovery isn\u0027t working for most working families. Over 20 million are still in need of full-time work. Wages and family income are falling. And in this bleak scene, the Obama coalition is faring among the worst.Comments (68)Wray HerbertAuthor, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027It\u0027s hard to prove, one way or the other. But my critics do have some psychological science on their side.Comments (120)Dave Maass and Trevor TimmIn the DOJ\u0027s world, this means anyone under 18 who reads a Hearst newspaper online could hypothetically face jail time. But Hearst\u0027s publications aren\u0027t the only ones with overly restrictive usage terms.Comments (23)Alison SpiegelAssociate Blog Editor, The Huffington PostChocolate mousse: elegant, airy, rich in flavor but light in texture, sophisticated but also simple. If ever there was a sexy dessert, chocolate mousse would be it.CommentsJared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThe recent rise in stock prices is largely a function of historically high corporate earnings (derived in part by squeezing workers and their wages) and very low interest rates, courtesy of the Federal Reserve (and, not to be a sourpuss, but for the record, the recent market highs are not all-time records once you adjust for inflation).Comments (110)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Their agreement on is very preliminary and hasn\u0027t yet even been blessed by the so-called Gang of Eight senators working on immigration reform, but the mere fact that AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka and Chamber of Commerce President Thomas J. Donohue agreed on anything is remarkable.Comments (234)Lynn ParramoreAlterNet Editor; Co-founder, Recessionwire; Founding Editor of New Deal 2.0I caught up with Chanos in his New York office to ask what\u0027s driving the current era of rampant fraud, who is to blame, what can be done, and the ways in which fraud costs us financially and socially.CommentsRichard StearnsPresident, World VisionHere\u0027s the problem: whether we are billionaires or just ordinary people, we tend to think that saving the lives of the world\u0027s most vulnerable children is somebody else\u0027s job -- not ours. And until that changes, children will continue to die.Comments (28)Greg LukianoffPresident, Foundation for Individual Rights in EducationAs the moral panic about bullying moves beyond grade school and into our nation\u0027s universities, it poses a serious threat to constitutionally protected speech.Comments (16)Mike Ragogna, 2013. 4.04Rabbi Herb Cohen, 2013. 3.04Angelo Federico Arcelli, 2013. 3.04Karen Fratti, 2013. 3.04Realtor.com, 2013. 3.04Kenneth Rosen, 2013. 3.04Gene Marks, 2013. 3.04Gabriel Rotello, 2013. 3.04Lisa M.
