{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week we saw a demonstration of the deep connection between imagery and outrage. On Tuesday, the hunter that killed the beloved and often photographed lion, Cecil, in Zimbabwe was identified as Minnesota dentist Dr. Walter Palmer. As the outrage went viral, the hunter became the hunted. His clinic\u0027s website was shut down, and a White House petition demanding extradition got 190,000 signatures. But the level of viral indignation also prompted some to question why the outpouring of outrage for Cecil surpassed that prompted by the killing of Sandra Bland. At the same time, we watched as Ohio prosecutor Joe Deters -- fueled by very disturbing bodycam footage of the police shooting of Samuel DuBose -- announced murder charges in the case, calling the incident \"outrageous,\" \"horrendous\" and an \"absolute tragedy.\" It was further proof of the power of images -- and that outrage doesn\u0027t have to be an either/or proposition.President Sisi should know that the world will be watching the court\u0027s verdict on Aug. 29, and his government\u0027s response to it. Media freedom in the region is at stake. And, as the Council of Europe has put it, \"it will be the commitment shown to free speech which determines whether or not Egypt grows -- or shrinks [--] in the eyes of the world.\"LawyerYear after year, Greece\u0027s creditors have promised that the bailout packages would bring about a meaningful rebound in output, employment, and exports. Instead, the country has experienced a depression comparable to the decline in output and employment that Germany suffered from 1930 to 1932.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia UniversityAt some point, a scientist must say it is time to stop waffling so much and say that the evidence is pretty strong. In my opinion, we have reached that point on the sea level issue. We have a global crisis, an emergency that calls for global cooperation to reduce emissions as rapidly as practical.ClimatologistWe\u0027re launching HuffPost Arabi, our 14th international edition. While all of our other editions around the world focus on one country, HuffPost Arabi will span the entire Arab World -- comprised of 377 million people living in 22 countries.When we use atrocity to inspire us to act, to ask the right questions, to reach across the globe and try to stop someone from being killed or suffering, our world will become a more livable one. Only then will we be able to hope to turn back the tide on genocide.Archbishop Emeritus of Cape TownArchbishop Emeritus of Cape TownMy brother died in a car crash when he was 18 and my family never really recovered from it. I can\u0027t begin to imagine the Prescott family\u0027s pain. We live in a world that makes it very, very difficult to be trans.Public speaker, activist, OlympianSen. Rand Paul has made safeguarding civil liberties a cornerstone of his presidential campaign, and he hasn\u0027t been afraid to take on his own party in that fight. But when it comes to the question of abortion, Rand Paul believes government should be making our most intimate decisions for us.Executive Director of the American Civil Liberties UnionWhen you think of a \"leader\"? -- ?who do you see? Many people think of a tall white man in a suit. Long ago, I decided that I wanted to do my part in changing that image.Director of Product at FacebookThere\u0027s a new kind of language being used around the Iran nuclear deal recently negotiated in Vienna. We can call it \"Trump Talk,\" defined as a drumbeat of outrageous political speech that is historically inaccurate, intellectually dishonest and even deceptive, morally and spiritually offensive and willfully tone deaf.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersThere\u0027s a woman who looks like a working mother -- she has a determined walk, but SEEMS a little lost. Don\u0027t we all. I wonder if she has the secret sauce to doing this every day, \u0027cause I sure as hell don\u0027t. I want to ask her how she does it.Executive Editor, Huffington Post VoicesHere we are, in the throes of an internecine war that birthed our new journalistic child, Huffington Post Arabi, full of freedom, challenges and bursting with life and the passion to find answers and solutions, searching for joy wherever it may be -- as all children of war do.Editor in Chief, HuffPost ArabiIn order to truly make our communities safer, we must make sure that people who have served their time are able to fully and productively engage in our society -- whether through education or employment or some other constructive means.83rd Attorney General of the United StatesBy allowing the religiously-affiliated troops to still ban gay adults, the BSA is making a religious exemption seem like a reasonable compromise when in fact it is allowing the very people who would discriminate to keep discriminating.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostLet\u0027s be clear: this attack on women\u0027s health is the opposite of liberty. Republicans are using women\u0027s health and women\u0027s lives as a political football - and that is wrong.Senior Member of the Senate Foreign Relations CommitteeThe Arctic may have oil, but the risks of drilling in the Arctic are too great. Arctic oil should stay in the ground. It\u0027s time for Shell to do the right thing and announce that they will pull out of the Arctic.US Senator from OregonScreen time isn\u0027t intrinsically evil -- and there are clearly lots of ways we can use technology to educate and engage children. But as we explore all its possibilities, it\u0027s really important that we make sure that technology doesn\u0027t stop our children, especially our youngest children, from interacting with people -- and the world around them.Pediatrician, Boston Children\u0027s Hospital, Harvard Medical SchoolPuerto Rico is on its way to one of the largest debt defaults in history, right up there with Greece and Argentina. Economic stagnation, or contraction, is not merely a result of an economic cycle but of major long term problems that make the island uncompetitive. But is there a way out?CEO, Professional Investor and Chairman, Intelligence Squared U.S. DebatesWe believe that not only is it possible to find options that align with your values, but also that by continuing to support these alternatives, we can grow those supply chains and industries which are effectively and transparently making sustainable improvements in their supply chain.Co-founder, JUSTThe American people should demand that the Senate act. Currently, there are 14 judicial nominees pending on the Senate floor and simply waiting for an up-or-down vote. These nominees are eminently qualified and deserve better treatment from Senate Republicans.Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary CommitteeDear fellow white feminists, we need to talk about Sandra Bland. More specifically, we need to talk about why we aren\u0027t talking about Sandra Bland.Producer, HuffPost LiveBy departing from tradition and becoming more inclusive and less doctrinaire, the court has deprived itself of any brakes that might stop the train it has set in motion. Many will think this is a good thing. The question Scalia and the other dissenters raise is whether it is a legal good thing.Davidson-Kahn Distinguished University Professor and Professor of Law at Florida International University; and Floersheimer Distinguished Visiting Professor of Law at Cardozo Law SchoolOnline trees sometimes get a bad rap, and they are only as accurate as the research skills of the person who created them. But they can be a great help to your research because so many of them are well researched with sources attached.Alphonse Fletcher University Professor and Director of the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research at Harvard UniversityEditor, writer, and teacherThe Updated Strategy will enable our nation to become a place where new HIV infections are rare, and where every affected person will have access to life-extending care, regardless of their circumstances.Senior Advisor to the President and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsAnkara has now finally and begrudgingly attacked ISIS in Syria. Why now? Just what is going on? There may not be any coherent strategy, but here\u0027s what I think are the key issues driving policy.Former vice chairman, CIA’s National Intelligence CouncilThey don\u0027t know that they are showing my family what it means for a community to gather together and support each other.Founder, Women With WorthThe word \"cop-out\" has been used by several publications to explain Clinton\u0027s viewpoint on both the TPP and Keystone XL.Columnist and author published in The Hill, The Baltimore Sun, The Jerusalem Post, Salon, and other publicationsI relish the fact that even when presented with the messiest tangles, the ones that look like they might have to be cut away, there is hope... there is growth... there are new beginnings if I loosen my grip a little and keep on trying.New York Times Bestselling Author and Certified Special Education TeacherSkewed media coverage can cause policymakers and members of the American public to draw erroneous conclusions. If you genuinely want to understand why Puerto Rico is mired in a crisis, but you disregard or downplay the lack of political and civil rights in the territory, then you are missing a core point.Resident Commissioner, Puerto RicoMany people, including many student debt holders, may be surprised to learn that people can be pursued for student debt even into their elder years. In fact, the government is withholding Social Security payments for some retirees, because their student loans have not been fully repaid.Senior Fellow, Advanced Leadership Initiative, Harvard University. Co-founder, National Student Debt Jubilee ProjectSenior Fellow, Advanced Leadership Initiative, Harvard University. Co-Founder and President Emeritus, Presidio Graduate SchoolCo-Director, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureISTANBUL -- The current situation in Turkey is nothing short of apocalyptic. Radical Islamists who have turned the country into a \"jihadi highway\" to Syria -- while Ankara has looked the other way -- are now carrying out attacks within Turkey itself. The AKP\u0027s Syria policy from 2011 onward has been the single greatest foreign policy disaster in the history of the Turkish Republic.Assistant professor at Marmara University; AuthorGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
