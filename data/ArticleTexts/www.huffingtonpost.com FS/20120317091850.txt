{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressWhile the various grand debates over the deficit that went down during 2011 received a massive quantity of coverage, the quality of that coverage was, at all times, pretty lacking. When the Senate\u0027s own attempt to form a deficit commission foundered, David Broder posited that it was the fault of Democratic \"committee chairmen.\" This was comically wrong -- 10 of those committee chairs voted for it, versus six against, which was not enough to decide the matter. The measure failed because seven Republican cosponsors of the bill bailed on it. This stuff isn\u0027t that hard to figure out. And yet this is just a single example out of many where ordinary Americans haven\u0027t been properly informed on a variety of important details about an issue.Read Post | Comments (883)Marian Wright Edelman, 03/16/12President, Children\u0027s Defense FundNow is the moment to add your voice in celebration and support of the Affordable Care Act and fight back attempts to weaken it.
