{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This was a week of goodbyes. On Tuesday, with big wins in the New York primary by Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, the chances for Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders to win the nominations before the conventions didn\u0027t exactly leave the building, but they\u0027re headed for the exits. Later that night, Elizabeth Warren, in an epic Twitter rant, said goodbye to Ted Cruz\u0027s whining. In response to an email Cruz sent out about the \"significant sacrifice\" he was making by running, including that his \"health and sleep are limited,\" Warren tweeted: \"Know whose sleep is limited? Working parents who stay up worrying about getting kids thru college w/o big debt. @TedCruz blocked #refi.\" At least both agree on the importance of sleep. But the saddest goodbye came on Thursday with the news of Prince\u0027s death. He was an incredibly talented, versatile, gender-bending, glow-in-the-dark genius whose music was so undeniably human and irresistible - a force of harmony in a time of division. As he wrote in his song Baltimore, \"Peace is more than the absence of war.\"Policy based on common assumptions and popular sentiments can become a recipe for mistaken prescriptions and misguided interventions. Nowhere is this divorce between rhetoric and reality more evident than in the formulation of global drug policies.Chair of the Kofi Annan FoundationFor the residents of Minneapolis, the loss of Prince is too large to describe.

Civil disobedience provides its own vocabulary, its own means of expression. By our act, we said: What\u0027s going on inside the Capitol, and in our country, is wrong. By our act, we said: It is not just wrong, it is unacceptable. And we won\u0027t accept it.President, Public CitizenI\u0027d planned to tell Mom how much I loved her, but it was too late. I swallowed the lump in my throat and instead all I could hear myself say was, \"Mom, I can\u0027t look at you, because if I do I know I\u0027ll lose it.\" We took one step, then another, and walked what I didn\u0027t know would be the last walk we\u0027d ever share again. And just like that, she gave me away.Wife, \"Fur baby\" Mother, Publicist, Survivor\"A tale of sound and fury, told by an idiot, signifying nothing.\" The indelible phrase is from Macbeth, Shakespeare\u0027s drama of a regicide whose bloody ambition and untethered soul tears apart his country. But it perfectly captures Donald Trump\u0027s campaign for president.Novelist and contributing opinion writerYesterday, Texas betrayed its true motive for filing the lawsuit against DAPA and DACA.

Why are fringe candidates getting all of the attention this year? Who are the moderates? These questions can all be answered by understanding something that has been unfolding for 40 years.Author, \u0027Double Happiness\u0027, aiming to make the world a better place via research, travel, and writingCompanies need to have rules -- that\u0027s a given -- but they don\u0027t have to be shortsighted and lazy attempts at creating order.

My ability to remain neutral, as you brazenly assault the American values I have spent my career promoting, became more difficult every time you found a microphone.Teacher, Education Leader, Photographer, Writer, Coach, Detroit \u0026 Michigan ProudFeminism\u0027s links with reproductive freedom go deeper. It means treating women as human beings rather than baby-making machines. It\u0027s recognition that women have talents and skills to offer the world beyond their ability to procreate.
