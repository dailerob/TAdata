{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week brought the annual post-Oscars debate about whether the show was offensive, boring, edgy, too long, or all of the above. The reviews for DC\u0027s mishandling of the sequester were less divided, with pretty much everyone agreeing that it\u0027s a self-inflicted disaster -- one President Obama called \"dumb,\" \"arbitrary,\" \"unnecessary,\" and \"inexcusable.\" Alternatives from both sides of the aisle were voted down, but the right solution -- repealing the jobs-and-growth-killing budget cuts -- wasn\u0027t even considered. Meanwhile, at least one new job opening was created this week, as ex-Pope Benedict spent the first night of his retirement watching TV reports about his departure. Hopefully he skipped over Bob Woodward\u0027s pathetic media appearances, in which he turned a polite email exchange between friends into a threat, or stories about Justice Scalia calling the Voting Rights Act a \"racial entitlement\" -- a statement far more offensive than anything said during the Oscars. Talk about \"seeing a boob.\"Read Post | Comments (61)Jamie Lee Curtis, 03/01/13Actress and children\u0027s book authorI was offended last week. As an Academy member, as the child of former Academy members and as a woman, I expected more from the best that the movie business has to offer. The Oscars are about honoring art and artists. It is not supposed to be a cheesy vaudeville show.Read Post | Comments (1,323)Sugata Mitra, 02/27/132013 TED Prize winnerWe need a curriculum of big questions, examinations where children can talk, share and use the Internet, and new, peer assessment systems.

But it would be great if they could find some time in the day for journalism too.Read Post | Comments (303)Marlo Thomas, 03/01/13Award-winning actress, author and activistLast Monday was terrible. The phone began ringing before 9 a.m., I had back-to-back (to-back) meetings well into the afternoon, and by the time happy hour arrived, I was not happy at all. My back hurt and my head was spinning. I was, what my mom used to call, \"cranky.\" Then a friend sent me an email.Read Post | Comments (58)John Pavley, 03/03/13CTO @ The Huffington Post, BloggerThe separation between arts and sciences is one of those areas where contemporary thinking has fallen behind our medieval, Roman, and Greek cultural ancestors.

And that was the problem. I didn\u0027t want to be healthy; I wanted to be skinny. And I wanted to be skinny more than I wanted to be anything else. When I was 11, a friend asked me what superpower I wanted. I told her I wanted to be invisible.Read Post | Comments (60)Keli Goff, 03/01/13Author and political correspondent, TheRoot.comIt\u0027s too simplistic to say that women are just jealous of them.

Movements are not built from the top down by powerful leaders but percolate from the bottom up from people who share common grievances.Read Post | Comments (59)Pete Townshend, 02/26/13Musician, AuthorSo when you watch these clips from the event, can you trust me?
