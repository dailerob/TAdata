{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonI\u0027m happy to announce that next week, on June 6th, Mika Brzezinski and I will be co-hosting the Huffington Post’s first-ever women\u0027s conference, \"The Third Metric: Redefining Success Beyond Money \u0026 Power.\" The participants include Valerie Jarrett, Jill Abramson, Cindi Leive, Katie Couric, Sen. Claire McCaskill, Lesley Stahl, Ali Wentworth, Erica Hill, Susie Essman, Joanna Coles, Candice Bergen, writer Rebecca Miller, neuroscientist Amishi Jha, Cisco CTO Padmasree Warrior, and a few good men, like Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini, George Stephanopoulos, Whole Foods CEO John Mackey, Joe Scarborough, and Adrian Grenier. We\u0027ll be discussing Leadership and Wisdom, Leaning In/Leaning Back, Managing a Frenetic Life, Wellness and the Bottom Line, Taking Care of Our Human Capital, and The Connection Between Giving Back and Well-Being, among other things. There will also be a panel by and for millennials, so that by the time they are in charge, there is a more humane and more sustainable definition of success that includes well-being, wisdom, wonder, empathy, and the ability to give back.Comments (17)Mika BrzezinskiCo-host of MSNBC’s \"Morning Joe\"Somewhat aspirational. I loved it. Didn\u0027t know what it meant. But I found it to be hilarious and cuttingly honest, which I admire. I considered getting a T-shirt with the words typed out across my chest.Comments (11)Dean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027The story of the Reinhart-Rogoff error tells us a great deal about how the elites use economists and the prestige of the economics profession in order to impose their will on the public.Comments (700)Russell BrandActor and comedianExtremists on both sides have a shared agenda: division, distrust, anger and violence. The answer is not for us to move further from one another, crouched in opposing fortresses constructed from vindictive words. We need now to move closer to one another, to understand one another.Comments (801)Jackie Morgan MacDougallWriter/Producer/On-Air PersonalityWe try to teach our daughters to love their bodies, no matter the size. We want to empower girls to respect themselves. But how can we teach them to make strong, independent decisions about their own selves when society, peers (and yes, even parents) are sending mixed messages?Comments (361)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesThe news that Michele Bachmann is throwing in the towel, not seeking reelection in 2014, is a triumph for LGBT activists and all progressives. And it\u0027s a stunning blow to the Tea Party and the evangelical right.Comments (388)Janet TavakoliPresident, Tavakoli Structured FinanceI\u0027ve been a critic of Facebook\u0027s performance since its IPO last year. Its recent earnings report didn\u0027t fail to disappoint compared to the hype.CommentsMurray LippSocial justice activistThere is no logical or reasonable basis for denying same-sex couples access to secular marriage laws. Opposing the inevitable (marriage equality) is a waste of time, money and energy.Comments (1,215)Ross LuippoldHuffPost Comedy Deputy EditorThe unenthusiastic reaction that many had for the show is not due to Mitch Hurwitz and his co-conspirators\u0027 failure to deliver, but instead, can be placed squarely on the knee-jerk reaction of an online crowd that favors the idea of reunions and revivals over delivery of them.CommentsMaggie JacksonAward-winning Journalist, Author of \"Distracted\"Today, the popular idea that our devices should fade into the background -- exemplified by Google\u0027s aim to get technology \u0027out of the way\u0027 via its Google Glass -- is alarming. If technology becomes invisible to us, we risk losing sight of how it shapes us, for good and for ill.Comments (44)Dr. Douglas FieldsNeurobiologist and author, \u0027The Other Brain\u0027Erasing memory is the plot for several popular science fiction movies, but the fact is that there is no convincing evidence that the memory of specific experience (called declarative memory) can be erased in humans -- until now.CommentsPaul Brandeis RaushenbushSenior Religion Editor, The Huffington Post\"My primary concern is to save lives. God has give us knowledge and technology to improve our lives through science. Are we going to throw condoms out? We are resistant to science in questions of sexuality, but when you you have a heart attack you go to the operation room - you are willing to accept science then.\"Comments (210)Norman OrnsteinFellow of the American Academy of Arts and SciencesDespite the impressive history of societal functionality and political stability over two-and-a-quarter centuries, the United States is not immune from problems that can strain its capacity to respond to problems, and to cause citizens to lose faith enough in their system.CommentsRobert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Don\u0027t be sidetracked today with the news of Michele Bachmann\u0027s decision not to run again. That\u0027s small potatoes relative to the biggest political and economic issue -- and showdown -- emerging in Congress.Comments (139)Dave MurphyFounder, Food Democracy Now!The march to stop Monsanto is one of the most pressing issues of our time. The problem is not just their corrosive lobbying practices, but the fact that the products they produce, GMO foods and chemical weed killers, are in more than 70% of the processed foods we eat and feed our families.Comments (273)Joanna MontgomeryWife, mother, writer, survivorSince my diagnosis a year and a half ago, I\u0027ve received countless recommendations for purported cures and treatments for cancer. Most have been respectful and well-intentioned recommendations from friends and family members. Others, maybe not so much.Comments (55)Jon WortmannMental Coach, AuthorNo one should be afraid of scales. They are simply an instrument that reveals mass. I hadn\u0027t stood on one in three years.CommentsBridal GuideIn the past six years of being a professional wedding photographer, it\u0027s also been sad to watch the progression from seeing smiling, encouraging and happy faces as the bride is escorted up the aisle to faces hidden behind the backs of cameras and cell phones that line the aisle.Comments (254)David WildTV Writer; Contributing Editor, Rolling Stone; Co-Author, \u0027Diary of a Player\"\u0027The first performer who I ever saw in concert was Steve Martin, and whether this man wants the credit or not, he changed my life forever.Comments (32)Josh SugarmannExecutive director, Violence Policy CenterNationwide, motor vehicle fatalities have steadily declined over decades, the result of careful strategies implemented to reduce deaths on the road. Meanwhile, violent gun deaths have continued unabated.Comments (237)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistWhether you need to conceal those tan lines for a backyard wedding, or you want to wear the season\u0027s hottest colors for that picnic in the park, we\u0027ve got you covered. After all, there\u0027s a lot more to summer style than pulling out those white shoes.CommentsAmy Auguston and Jen SapitroWithout a safe home environment or reliable guardians, Kibera girls face a difficult future.CommentsAngelica V. Hernandez, Ph.D.Writer, teacher, speakerWhen she twists her body, I think of a diver going into a flip, transforming her long sleek body into the diameter of a radial tire. She is balled up, resisting my touch. I talk to her in a soft, playful voice, an attempt to lessen the shame and fear that deforms her body.CommentsVincent Autin and Bruno BoileauOur thoughts are with all those organizations, gay or straight, that rallied to make this possible, and with all the gay people who fought for their rights and who are unfortunately no longer here to live this celebration. It is with particular feeling that we say to them, \"Thank you.\"Comments (52)Brenda PetersonBrendaPetersonBooks.comMaybe we\u0027re asking the wrong question by just focusing on whether these haunting CGI merpeople are real or myth. The real question is: Why are we making our oceans too dangerous to sustain all life?Comments (156)Vivien Lesnik WeismanFilmmakerThe case of Jeremy Hammond is illustrative of a trend to target, overcharge and come down hard on those the state perceives as threatening. The supposed threats are due to their beliefs and/or actions toward information freedom and transparency.Comments (22)Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorMany people\u0027s view of economic policy is that \"nothing works\" be it monetary or fiscal policy. Sometimes it doesn\u0027t and sometimes its consequences are unintended. But broadly speaking, such cynicism is dangerously wrong.CommentsDianne K. SalerniTeacher, AuthorThe moment I saw the photograph--a grave enclosed in an iron cage--I knew there was a book in it for me.Comments (420)Aaron GouveiaBlogger, The Daddy FilesGuys see the low bar set for dads on commercials and TV shows and will only rise high enough to meet it. And when their wives dress the baby in a shirt that basically calls them idiots, they\u0027ll soon learn they\u0027re expected to be know-nothing dolts, so there\u0027s no need to improve.Comments (1,017)Michael RothPresident, Wesleyan UniversityThe free inquiry at the core of learning certainly depends on vigorous discussion and debate; it depends on our willingness to take risks and to discover that even our deepest convictions may be mistaken. But learning also requires freedom from the senseless wounding of aggression.CommentsVivian NorrisPh.D. focusing on Globalization and Media StudiesBeyond more focused EU spending is also the responsibility of business to help bring down youth unemployment by showing what they have to offer Europe in order to make the transition from school to work flow more smoothly.Comments (33)Dr. Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, 2013.29.05Beverly Bell, 2013.29.05John Blumenthal, 2013.29.05JustLuxe, 2013.29.05Julie Gerstenblatt, 2013.29.05Sharon Hill, 2013.29.05David Goldberg, 2013.29.05Dr. Brian C.
