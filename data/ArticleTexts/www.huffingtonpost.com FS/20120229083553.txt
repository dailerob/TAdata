{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior Advisor and Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Affairs and Public EngagementWhen women are denied the chance to contribute because of domestic violence our entire society suffers. When women have a chance to achieve their dreams, everybody benefits. And when women succeed, society as a whole does better. There is much work we still must do, but seeing courageous efforts around the world devoted to stopping sexual and gender-based violence has renewed my confidence that if we all do our part, we can and will win the fight. We will create a world where no woman lives in fear, and where every woman has the chance to work hard and reach her full potential.Read Post | Comments (38)Jamal Abdi and Trita Parsi, 02/28/12Just as with the lead-up to the Iraq War, the pathway to war with Iran will be paved with false assertions, self-fulfilling saber-rattling and political weakness that might seem insignificant now, but will in retrospect turn out to be disastrous.Read Post | Comments (223)Jean Alves, MS, RD, 02.27.2012Nutrition Communications, Quaker Food \u0026 SnacksIf you\u0027re ready to wake up to a better you, here\u0027s some food for thought on how to go from breakfast newbie to enjoying the breakfasts of champions.Read Post | Comments (13)Soraya Chemaly, 02/28/12Feminist satirist and media criticEither you are willing to support and participate in a culture in which men, refusing to accept women as equals, use a perverted claim of divine right to control women and their bodies, or you don\u0027t.Read Post | Comments (304)Stephen F.
