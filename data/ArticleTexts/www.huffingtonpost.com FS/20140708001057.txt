You\u0027re attached to the phone, and the phone is attached to the wall. And you can\u0027t go anywhere, so you end up sitting and staring at the phone itself -- and just listening.AuthorEach new day offers a new experience and a new chance to try something different. It is refreshing, but it is also innocent and child-like.

Was there anyone who would speak for them?Public education advocate and blogger, EduShysterSerious people now ask whether we have moved from a post-war into a pre-war world.

So what must we do to fulfill the promise of diversity?National diversity expert; Principal and Chief Strategist of Criticality Management Consulting; Former Associate Dean of Harvard CollegeIt is nothing short of disgusting that the self-proclaimed \"greatest country on earth\" is engaged in a vehement discussion on minimum wages.Richard Zombeck is a freelance writer for hire living in the Boston area and hangs out at www.zombeckink.comMany stars come and go, never to be heard from again. (Only the smartest and luckiest have long, consistently fruitful careers.) But then there are the exceptions, the ones who go on to enjoy a resurgence in popularity and creativity after a frustrating lull.Canadian writer and bloggerLargely under the radar of national and even local media, California has begun a quiet revolution in climate policy that could change the whole national conversation about curbing global warming.Chief Operating Officer, The Greenlining InstituteOn July 9, the American Congress will convey a powerful message through the bestowal of the Congressional Gold Medal to remember the courageous acts of Raoul Wallenberg, a diplomat who chose to rise to a higher moral calling.U.S. Ambassador to SwedenLow wages, debts and dim prospects all subjugate. This is the condition of a shocking number of Americans as income inequality rises. And their economic desperation and subordination occurred by design.International President, United SteelworkersThey never tell you in teacher school, and it\u0027s rarely discussed elsewhere. It is never, ever portrayed in movies and tv shows about teaching. Teachers rarely bring it up around non-teachers for fear it will make us look weak or inadequate.Teacher, writer, blogger at curmudgucationTaking away control from women is the point, not religious freedom. The goal of this conservative war on women, being facilitated now by the U.S. Supreme Court, is, in fact, doing away with women\u0027s control of their reproductive and thus their economic lives.Professor of Theology, Chicago Theological SeminaryWhen I tried to do it all, I cut corners everywhere. I made sacrifices with everything: my work, my kids, my marriage, my home. And I was miserable. Our crazy, hectic lifestyle wasn\u0027t working.Lawyer turned stay-at-home momThese days, sports are being promoted as a series of \"happenings\" -- celebrations.

I was sitting in my wheelchair in the locker room while the other kids played a sport in gym class. I could hear them and wondered how long it would take for anyone to find me. I felt so alone. I thought I was a burden to my family, and I felt hopeless.Feisty physically disabled chick, proud mom, advocate, writer, coffee addict, cat lover, reality TV junkie, eternal optimistWhy root for a Brazilian loss? Because if they win, the cries of the poor and desperate in Brazil will be drowned out by the cheers of the soccer-crazed fans who could actually afford to get inside the stadium.Editor, Digital Innovation, The Huffington PostIt\u0027s impossible to prove a negative. In other words, one can\u0027t actually find Bigfoot to prove that he\u0027s not real; therefore, Bigfoot might be real because we just haven\u0027t found him yet.
