McGlothlin\u0027s story by explaining that in the fallen soldier\u0027s pocket was a poem that, as the president put it, \"represented the spirit of this fine Marine. The poem was called \u0027Don\u0027t Quit.\u0027\" Then the topper: \"In our fight to keep America free, we\u0027ll never quit.\" And just like that, the sacrifice of this courageous young American had been co-opted in the service of a disastrous war. Reduced to a zippy one-liner, a heart-rending punchline, a camera-ready sound bite used to equate for the nation a wise change of course with cowardly quitting.READ POST | comments (21)12.16.2005 Norman LearSo tell me Lord: In the Bible, you were known to test societies by forcing them to endure tribulations for seven years.
