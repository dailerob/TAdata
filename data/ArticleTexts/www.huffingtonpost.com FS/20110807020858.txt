{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, the United States had its credit rating downgraded from AAA to AA-plus, making our nation the financial equivalent of the short, fat, bald, masked guy in those FreeScore.com commercials. In announcing the downgrade, Standard \u0026 Poor\u0027s cited \"the difficulties of bridging the gulf between the political parties\" over reducing the deficit, and indicated they wanted even more spending cuts from Congress -- joining the misguided consensus that completely misses the fact that economic growth is the most powerful weapon against the deficit. The White House challenged S\u0026P\u0027s analysis, claiming it was off by trillions of dollars. Maybe the ratings agency was using the same math it had when it helped create the fiscal crisis we are still struggling to get out of by awarding AAA ratings to trillions of dollars in subprime mortgages repackaged as securities.Read Post | CommentsDavid Bromwich, 8/2/11Professor of Literature at YaleNow that President Obama has signed the new debt ceiling into law and subscribed his party to an austerity program that assumes a state of permanent economic emergency, the question what made him do it? becomes more pressing than ever.Read Post | CommentsValerie Jarrett, 8/5/11Senior Advisor and Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Affairs and Public EngagementThe president has also always believed that a leader\u0027s job is to act on behalf of the people he serves, not to score political points. The president will never stop fighting on their behalf. I could not be prouder to be a part of his team.Read Post | CommentsWill.i.am, 8/6/11Musician, technology advocate, and creator/executive producer of i.am FIRST: ScienceThe theory is simple -- if entertainers perform in programs like the Teen Choice Awards, then why can\u0027t we do it for our kids who get good grades?Read Post | CommentsArianna Huffington, 8/4/11I often feel that we are living in a split-screen world, where what part of the screen you are looking at will determine your perception of where things stand. And nowhere is this more pronounced than in the African-American community.Read Post | CommentsAnna Deavere Smith, 8/4/11Actress and playwrightWhen I conducted my research for my latest one-woman show, Let Me Down Easy, I was concerned by images I saw of Black African people in distress in major U.S. publications. Were these photos engendering action, or merely pity or worst apathy?Read Post | CommentsPaul Reiser, 8/3/11Actor, writer, and stand-up comedianMy son is away at a summer camp that has a website posting photos of what he\u0027s doing all day. Sure, when I first heard about this I was a little put off. But the minute I saw the first pictures of him laughing radiantly in the summer sun, I got over my civil liberty concerns toot-suite.Read Post | CommentsSheila C. Johnson, 8/4/11Entrepreneur, Philanthropist, FilmmakerI\u0027m proud and excited to be working with Arianna Huffington -- a true visionary of modern media. The time is right for BlackVoices. The need is clear; the opportunities are enormous.Read Post | CommentsMichael Steele, 8/4/11Political analyst; Fmr. Chairman, Republican National Committee; Fmr. Lt. Governor, MarylandAfrican-Americans\u0027 21st century reality is simply this: it\u0027s time to stand for something different. The debate we\u0027re having is no longer productive. It\u0027s time for solutions that come from us, from within our house, our family and ultimately our community as a whole.Read Post | CommentsHeidi Klum, 8/4/11Model, ActressHaving four children, with one having straight hair and three curly, it\u0027s a bit of a new world for me. Growing up with straight hair myself, that was all I really knew how to work with. It was pretty straightforward: wash, air dry, done.Read Post | CommentsMohamed el-Erian, 8/6/11CEO and co-CIO, Pacific Investment Management CompanyThere will be endless debate on whether S\u0026P was justified in stripping America of its AAA rating. But this historic action has now taken place, and the global system must adjust. There are consequences, uncertainties, and a silver lining.Read Post | CommentsMarlo Thomas, 7/31/11Award-winning actress, author and activistIt seems like a good time to take stock of how far women have come in this world. From my vantage point, I can\u0027t think of a more exciting time to be a woman: We\u0027ve finally reached our era of great expectations.Read Post | CommentsLarry Flynt, 8/3/11Publisher of Hustler magazine and free speech advocateThe media has spent the past three years making Casey Anthony into a media star. Without that, no one would even know who she is.Read Post | CommentsSen. Kirsten Gillibrand, 8/2/11U.S. Senator from New YorkIt is unfortunate that Congress missed an opportunity today to seriously take on debt reduction with a balanced approach. I have not been in Washington long, but long enough to know it is broken.Read Post | CommentsMark Penn, 8/2/11CEO, Burson-MarstellerThe 11th hour budget deal may save the country from default but is unlikely to save either the president or the Republicans from continued political fallout for taking the country near the brink of financial calamity.Read Post | CommentsJanuary Jones, 8/2/11ActressIf even just a fraction of all Shark Week viewers took action to protect sharks, it would equal millions of people speaking up for the ocean\u0027s top predators. We shouldn\u0027t be scared of sharks, we should be scared for them.Read Post | CommentsDylan Ratigan, 8/4/11Host of MSNBC\u0027s \"The Dylan Ratigan Show\" and author of the soon to be released book, \"Greedy Bastards\"Let\u0027s hope that this relative market pinprick got someone\u0027s attention at the White House, or on the tour bus. Because the market\u0027s tendency is to ratchet up the pain for those who fail to recognize its message.Read Post | CommentsRobin Quivers, 8/1/11Anchor, \u0027The Howard Stern Show\u0027Captain America underscores the fact that we clearly have trouble confronting our own past, but we have no problem talking about other people\u0027s problems. Boy, did we get on those South Africans for apartheid!Read Post | CommentsSteven Van Zandt, 8/1/11Record producer, Songwriter, MusicianWhen people are looking for a place to point the finger after this disaster or near disaster they should look no further than the Media. When did their job become spewing out contradictory information 24/7?Read Post | CommentsDr. Peggy Drexler, 8/1/11Author, \u0027Our Fathers Ourselves. Daughters, Fathers, And The Changing American Family\u0027Fathers forced to be away from their families for long periods elicit sympathy and even admiration for their sacrifice. But for mothers in the same situation, the reactions are often more complex -- extending to maternal choice and even fitness.Read Post | CommentsGordon Brown, 8/4/11Former Prime Minister of the United KingdomEuropean leaders were quick to define last month\u0027s Euro summit of 2011 as the day European leaders seized the moment and faced the crisis down. Instead it will be seen as a huge missed opportunity, the turning point at which history failed to turn.Read Post | CommentsSec. Kathleen Sebelius, 8/1/11Secretary of Health and Human ServicesWomen have unique healthcare needs across their life span and have high rates of chronic disease, including diabetes, heart disease and stroke. Yet while women are more likely to need preventive health care services, they often have less ability to pay.Read Post | CommentsMarcus Samuelsson, 8/2/11Follow me on Twitter @MarcusCooksIt\u0027s often hard for us to imagine going without some of our luxuries like travel, dining out, or Internet, much less our basic necessities like food and water. But try for a minute to imagine how life would be with such deprivations.Read Post | CommentsMandy Moore, 8/2/11Singer-songwriter, actress and PSI AmbassadorMalaria is responsible for over 40% of deaths in health care facilities across Cameroon. This means that thousands of children -- as well as adults -- in this West African country die each year from an easily preventable disease.Read Post | CommentsRuss Feingold, 8/4/11Unless congressional leaders appoint progressives willing to stand up to moneyed interests, the new congressional super committee will be nothing less than a chopping block for Social Security.Read Post | CommentsCecile Richards, 8/3/11President, Planned Parenthood Action FundAffordable birth control means better birth control. When cost is not a concern, women are more likely to choose more effective birth control methods. Imagine -- making your birth control decision based on what fits you rather than what fits your wallet!Read Post | CommentsArianna Huffington, 2011.08.07April L.
