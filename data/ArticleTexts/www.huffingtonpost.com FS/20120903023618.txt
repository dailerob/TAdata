{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, Clint Eastwood\u0027s rambling chat with an empty chair spawned a run of comical memes. But the moment was actually an apt visual metaphor for the convention itself, with the empty chair representing not Invisible Obama but the Invisible Issues that went unmentioned -- including the issues HuffPost sought to put a spotlight on this week with our Shadow Convention: the corrupting influence of money on our politics, the persistence of poverty in America, and the disastrous war on drugs. It was a site-wide effort. To see the breadth of what our HuffPost editors did, click here. And click here to watch HuffPost Live\u0027s amazing, comprehensive coverage. And because the neglect is a bipartisan affair, we\u0027re doing it again during the DNC, taking on these issues from a whole different set of angles. Don\u0027t miss HuffPost Live\u0027s Shadow Coverage this coming Tuesday-Thursday between 12-4 p.m. EST.Read Post | Comments (137)Howard Fineman, 08/31/12Editorial Director, AOL Huffington Post Media GroupMitt Romney did some of what he needed to do, but not everything he needed to do, at the Republican convention that ended Thursday night.Read Post | Comments (935)Bill Moyers and Bernard Weisberger, 08/30/12No serious proposal to take the money out of politics, or even reduce its tightening grip on the body politic, will emerge from Tampa or Charlotte, so the sounds of celebration and merriment are merely prelude to a funeral cortege for America as a shared experience.Read Post | Comments (889)Arianna Huffington, 08/28/1220 million Americans are unemployed or underemployed. So we\u0027ve chosen to use the unique opportunity offered by the national conventions to launch a multi-part effort to put the spotlight on solutions, innovative ideas, and the men and women who are actually creating jobs right now.Read Post | Comments (567)Mohamed A. El-Erian, 08/31/12CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOGreek officials should certainly hope that collective European action will succeed in stabilizing these other two countries\u0027 economies. But they should also realize that too great a success could, ironically, map into a higher probability of a Grexit.Read Post | Comments (73)Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm, 08/27/12Former governor of Michigan; Host, \u0027The War Room\u0027 on Current TV; columnist, Politico; faculty member, UC BerkeleyIt seems the Republican obsession with being pro-life lasts about nine months. After that, it\u0027s each baby for herself. So Democrats, let\u0027s be clear and strong: Being pro-birth is not automatically the same thing as being pro-life.Read Post | Comments (1,395)Marian Wright Edelman, 08/31/12President, Children\u0027s Defense FundWe are once again at a critical turning point for our children and nation. Despite all the harsh lessons of the past and all the lofty rhetoric about who we want and need to be as a 21st century multicultural nation in a multiracial and multicultural world, we’re heading in the wrong direction.Read Post | Comments (247)John Hodgman, 08/27/12Author, actor, comedian, and minor television personalityI will reveal here that I am going to vote for Obama, and I hope he wins, and here is the reason: I LIKE WINNING.Read Post | Comments (873)Russell Bishop, 08/30/12Author, Consultant and Executive CoachThe GPS for the Soul mobile app builds on the content in the GPS for the Soul page on The Huffington Post, offering an array of anytime, any place stress relief to help free users from their hyper-connected lives.Read Post | CommentsMarlo Thomas, 08/30/12Award-winning actress, author, and activistSummer Wilson couldn\u0027t believe her eyes when her mother handed her a journal written more than 15 years ago -- a diary that she never even knew existed. As she leafed through its pages, it quickly became apparent that the journal was all about her and how she almost died.Read Post | Comments (35)Harry Shearer, 08/28/12Your dog\u0027s best friendAs we wait to see what effect Isaac will have on the Army Corps of Engineers $10 billion-plus \"hurricane risk reduction system\" in New Orleans, I can\u0027t help thinking about last week\u0027s news from levees.org. When government adopts efficiency as its top priority, decisions like the Corps\u0027 get made. And people die.Read Post | Comments (220)Gary Hart, 08/31/12President, Hart International, Ltd.Partisan politics, so wrapped up in creating an antagonism between capitalism and government, misses the point. If we are to maintain ourselves as a republic, certain foundational principles of a republic must be upheld.Read Post | Comments (606)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 09/01/12Author, research psychologist, and gender expertAs parents, our responsibility is to keep kids unharmed. That doesn\u0027t mean shielding them from all possibility of defeat. It means letting them fail safely. Here\u0027s how to help your child take risks -- and make mistakes, inevitably -- safely.Read Post | Comments (76)Paul Slansky, 08/27/12Writer; Contributor to The New YorkerGiven the demands for Akin\u0027s resignation from a mere Senate race when his musings on \"legitimate rape\" were publicized, what do you imagine the reaction would be if people were as familiar with VP wannabe Ryan\u0027s stunning statement?Read Post | Comments (5,622)Kerry Kennedy, 08/27/12President, Robert F.

She was recording the beating of a woman by his colleagues.Read Post | Comments (59)Dr. Dean Ornish, 08/29/12Medical Editor, The Huffington Post, Founder and President of Preventive Medicine Research InstituteAs the Republican and Democratic national conventions are approaching, the debate on how to address soaring Medicare costs is heating up. But there is much more heat than light, and our country seems more polarized than ever.Read Post | Comments (156)D.L. Hughley, 08/30/12Actor and stand-up comedianWhat I do have a problem with is someone who is insincerely pro-life, someone for whom this is an abstract concept with no relation to the reality. One of the hardest things for me to recount in my recent book was a sexual assault I witnessed when I was a kid...Read Post | Comments (261)Karin Kasdin, 08/31/12Author, \u0027Oh Boy, Oh Boy, Oh Boy: Confronting Motherhood, Womanhood and Selfhood in a Household of Boys\u0027I\u0027m sorry ladies, and I want you to know I\u0027m eating my just desserts. I\u0027ve left my phone or my sunglasses in restaurants and shops all over town.

Ben Cardin, 08/28/12Democratic U.S. Senator from MarylandThe act of voting is a right -- not a privilege -- in our country. American men and women have fought and died to defend and to exercise their right to vote. What Republicans are doing across the country is a blatant violation of the civil rights of hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Americans.Read Post | Comments (412)Jeffrey Sachs, 08/28/12Director, Earth Institute at Columbia University; author, \u0027The Price of Civilization\u0027Poverty reduction has entered a new era.
