{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week brought a surprise: In a time of rampant division, we saw an entire people -- or at least 55 percent of them -- choose unity instead. On Thursday, 3.6 million Scots went to the polls and chose not to change Great Britain to Somewhat Less Great Britain by voting against severing their 307-year union. Now, after the celebratory champagne and haggis (or whatever one drinks with haggis), comes the hard work of ironing out a new division of power. Less surprising was the continued upheaval in the NFL, as yet another player was arrested for domestic violence. On Friday, Commissioner Roger Goodell pledged to \"make changes\" and \"do better.\" But the uniformly negative response to Goodell\u0027s fumbled press conference makes it clear that this NFL season will continue to be defined more by what happens off the field than on it.We march because we know that climate change affects everyone, but its impacts are not equally felt: those who have contributed the least to causing the crisis are hit hardest, here and around the world.Author of a dozen books, including \u0027The End of Nature\u0027 and \u0027Deep Economy\u0027Recording Secretary, Transport Workers Union Local 100Executive Director, NYC Environmental Justice AllianceWhen former Congressman Anthony Weiner -- a Democrat from New York -- dismissed my concerns about the Wall Street-Washington revolving door, it was business as usual.Democratic Senator from MassachusettsWhether you have blogged on HuffPost, commented on, shared or talked about a story or just made us a regular part of your media diet, you have been a key part of the conversation we set out to start a little over nine years ago. Indeed, without you, there would be no HuffPost. So thank you for being part of this remarkable journey -- a journey that is still very much in progress.The 20th century challenge was for Scotland to maintain its cultural identity while at the same time cooperating with the four nations of the U.K.. Now the challenge is even greater: to uphold cultural traditions and national identities in a world where there are no such things as nation-only solutions.Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; UN Special Envoy for Global EducationTo make personal changes is to do too little. Only great movements, only collective action can save us now. Only is a scary word, but when the ship is sinking, it can be an encouraging one as well. It can hold out hope.Author, \u0027A Paradise Built in Hell\u0027We know it\u0027s important not to confuse day-to-day weather patterns with climate, which measure variations of things like temperatures and humidity over long periods of time, but it\u0027s clear that these disasters are made more powerful by global warming. The pain is only going to get worse for us and for future generations, unless we act now.Managing Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanySenior writer, Moyers \u0026 Company on public TV. Senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.By finding alternatives to fossil fuels that pollute our air and disrupt our climate, American businesses, families and communities are showcasing the single most practical way to tackle climate change, starting now.Oscar-nominated actor, climate change activistEven as other countries move forward, the US must continue to lead. The US is the second largest carbon emitter in the world and the largest overall contributor to the climate crisis. We have an obligation to take bold steps to reduce our own carbon pollution.President, NRDCIt\u0027s worth remembering these days -- as President Obama declares that air power will be the primary and perhaps only U.S. effort against ISIS in Iraq and Syria -- that the impressive Pentagon videos of missile warheads exploding in the crosshairs obscure the difficulty that air power has in achieving positive, lasting effects on the ground.Senior Military Correspondent, The Huffington PostI\u0027ve often said on my show that domestic violence is a silent epidemic. Right now, in the aftermath of the NFL controversy surrounding several players\u0027 involvement in domestic abuse cases, it\u0027s anything but silent. We have arrived at a teachable moment in America for children and adults.Author, Host \"Dr. Phil\"Satire has always been a method for us to explore our faults and false expectations of world order. But satire in the movies might be dead now, replaced by daily satire that is for real. We live in a world of complete and utter madness. Nothing highlights this absurdism like the current conflict with the Islamic State.Academy Award-winning director, screenwriter and producerThese days, the barrier to advancing is more likely to be self-constructed. That\u0027s right: Your own worst workplace nemesis is you.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarWhat is the first rule of \"Fight Club\"? The first rule of Fight Club is: \"Don\u0027t talk about \u0027Fight Club.\u0027\" The first rule of documentaries is: Don\u0027t make a documentary -- make a MOVIE. Stop making documentaries. Start making movies.Oscar and Emmy-winning DirectorWithout fundamental public health infrastructures in place, no country is stable, no society is secure, no resilience exists to withstand the shocks that our 21st-century world is delivering with ever-greater frequency and force.America has come to the breaking point. Our ability to think our way to a solution is temporarily impaired thanks to the utterly devastating annihilation of reasonable economic ideas by the neo-liberal revolution. So before we rebuild the economy, we\u0027ve got a job ahead of us to rebuild some ideas.Venture AnachronistThis sends a very clear message to children in this country, boys in particular, who aspire to be athletes, or those who simply see these athletes as role models. The time has come to flip that message and make it one of zero tolerance.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersIt is a moral disgrace that child poverty in the U.S. is higher than adult poverty, higher than for children in almost all other competitor nations, and higher than our country with the world\u0027s largest economy should ever allow.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundRegardless of the soundness of the president\u0027s strategy, to ensure greater success in defeating ISIS, three distinct interlinked aspects must be factored in. Acting accordingly will permanently degrade ISIS and prevent it from rising again to pose a serious threat to our allies in the Middle East and Western security in the future.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUCorporate science is, above all else, secretive. The flimsy excuse of \"trade secrets\" is used to prevent independent or academic scientists from evaluating exaggerated corporate claims.Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorThe New York state elections just concluded, and the national midterms are still weeks away, but there is a campaign office in downtown Manhattan that has just gone into overdrive. Volunteers there are hard at work on another deadline: September 21.Co-founder and Communications Director, 350.orgThe only way to change professional football is at its foundation, transforming the culture in our schools and what defines masculinity -- and what defines being a girl or a woman or gay or transgender -- and, most importantly, that needs to happen within sports programs, not separate from them.Editor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesThere are 3 million people around the world and thousands here in the U.S., many of them kids, whose lives could be changed by a little bar of soap.Senate Majority Leader (D-Nev.)Senator (R-Nev.)It was like Mrs. K knew what our morning was going to be like. How did she know that the letter was exactly what I needed to read right at that moment? I don\u0027t know, but I was glad she did.Author, People I Want to Punch in the Throat: Competitive Crafters, Drop-off Despots, and Other Suburban Scourges, I Just Want to Pee Alone, and I Just Want to Be AloneFrench Jews certainly have had enough of all this. Are we still at home, they ask themselves, in this strange country where the vilest anti-Zionism, the stubbornest Holocaust denial, and the murkiest competition for victimhood are combining to produce a new and potentially devastating form of anti-Semitism?Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.Our colleges and universities aspire to help students to find what John Dewey called \"the large and human significance\" in their lives and work. This requires not just teaching to the test and not just parroting critiques. It requires learning to think with contexts and concepts, deploying cooperation and creativity.President, Wesleyan UniversityWhy does the world seem to celebrate schmoozers, and what might we be missing when we assume quieter people have nothing worth saying? This persuasive talk from author (and self-proclaimed introvert) Susan Cain will leave you questioning your assumptions about what makes a good leader, and you may see the people in your life a bit differently - yourself included.\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"Homes keep getting bigger while our buying power gets smaller and smaller. Maybe it\u0027s time to respect the \"old\" in our lives -- starting with our living spaces.Executive Editor, HuffPost HomeFor much of this decade, Tea Party-backed lawmakers have been at war with public sector employees across the country. They\u0027ve tried, and in a few cases succeeded, in taking away public servants\u0027 ability to collectively bargain. But now the battle is going abroad.General President, International Brotherhood of TeamstersThis has nothing to do with privacy. I\u0027m so tired of people blabbering on about how we need to respect people\u0027s privacy. Sexuality shouldn\u0027t be a private matter. It certainly isn\u0027t for straight people.Executive Editor, HuffPost Gay VoicesWhether or not President Obama intends to send ground troops into combat in Iraq, there is a real danger that the dynamics of the conflict will lead to that result. The time to head off a wider war is now.Director, Arms and Security Project, Center for International PolicyGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"300,000+ MARCH IN NY",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
