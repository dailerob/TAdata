{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Whenever it appears that frontrunner Hillary Clinton has finally caught a break, along come reminders of the unexploded time-bombs that still lie waiting, just up the campaign trail. Take the email scandal (please). As Bernie Sanders pointed out during the CNN debate, in an uncharacteristic moment of courtliness, people are sick of it. The Republican use of it becomes more blatantly political by the day. So it\u0027s over, right? Well, not quite -- because it\u0027s still not clear what exactly was legal or illegal, and who is vulnerable to prosecution for what. We do know, however, that this question is being actively pursued by the FBI.Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is an epidemic in the U.S. The American Academy of Audiology (AAA) reports that by second grade almost three times as many children have hearing loss today as compared to just a decade ago, increasing to four times as many by eighth grade.Founder, Ear Peace: Save Your Hearing FoundationThe ACC has been doing a lot more than just posting disinformation on the Internet. Along with Koch Industries -- owner of Georgia-Pacific, one of the largest U.S. formaldehyde and plywood manufacturers -- it has been currying favor on Capitol Hill with large sums of lobbying and campaign cash.Senior Writer, Union of Concerned ScientistsLast week, the Democrats received an unexpected gift from the Federal Reserve Board. Lael Brainard, a member of the Fed\u0027s Board of Governors, gave a speech in which she questioned the need for the Fed to raise interest rates.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Modern-day voter suppression isn\u0027t confined to Alabama alone. For the past several years, dozens of states have adopted tough new voter ID laws that severely inhibit the poor, people of color, the elderly, those in rural communities and others from voting.President, National Action NetworkPeople for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has thrown its hat in with an anti-pit bull coalition. This group\u0027s agenda is to have pit bulls banned across the United States -- a move which seems to lead, inexorably, to the dogs being killed.Animal Welfare Editor, The Huffington PostThe UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) appeared set to call on governments to end the criminalization of drug use and possession, according to DPA Honorary Board Member Richard Branson -- but in a dramatic turn of events withdrew its briefing paper under pressure from at least one country, according to the BBC.Director of Communications Strategy, Drug Policy AllianceA full-time worker with two kids needs at least $30,135 this year to be safely out of poverty. That\u0027s $15 an hour for a forty-hour workweek. Any amount below this usually requires government make up the shortfall.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027It is time to cease the operations of the Special Committee on Benghazi. This taxpayer-sponsored witch-hunt must come to an end now. It is a textbook example of what Secretary Clinton\u0027s husband aptly labeled \"the politics of personal destruction.\"U.S. Congressman for Florida\u0027s 9th DistrictMy daughter, I promise to create a world around you in which your brothers and I educate men to control their behavior and subdue their anger and violent actions, and hopefully soon we can end violence against women.Visiting Fellow, Harvard University\u0027s Prince Alwaleed bin Talal School of Islamic StudiesHillary\u0027s claim that \"nobody\" supports sending U.S. ground troops to Syria was fundamentally misleading, because whoever calls for the U.S. to establish a \"safe zone\" in Syria -- as Hillary did in her previous utterance to which Sanders was responding -- is calling for \"ground troops.\"Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicyOur presumed good intentions allow us to rationalize destroyed hospitals, pulverized houses and children\u0027s corpses as preventable accidents, so long as we promise to try real hard to avoid such errors during the next blitz.Jeff Faux, author of The Servant EconomyI see my psychotherapist on a weekly basis, without any of the feelings of shame widespread in our society regarding this practice. But I have a barrel of guilt inside me that is wearing away what is left of the love of life in my heart.Setting a unique news agenda that builds bridges and global understanding since 2005.I recently spoke with Yanar Mohammed about the impact of the U.S. military invasion and occupation of Iraq, the people\u0027s uprisings in Tahrir Square, Baghdad, and the horrific violence, fear and trauma that Iraqi women face daily.Tony award winning playwright, performer and activistIt isn\u0027t easy filming people who are enduring such physical and emotional hurt. But this needs to be done. The members of Delta Chi stand in the front, heads bowed, arms around one another, tears in their eyes and pain on their faces. What happened next might be the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.Photographer, blogger and student\"Should I turn out the lights?\" He was already getting out of the bed as he said it. For the first time in nine months, I was completely naked in front of a man, and the first thing he wanted to do when he took my dress off was turn out the lights.There\u0027s no wrong way to be a woman.If Jerusalem cannot provide the microcosm of Israeli-Palestinian peaceful coexistence, there will never be peace between the two sides.Senior Fellow, Center for Global Affairs, NYUI felt a closer relationship with God could only grow through studying the sacred texts in order to know God better, to listen to him through scripture and be inspired by His expectation and example.Author, \u0027How’s Your Faith?\u0027Writer and EducatorIt was a typical Monday morning at the Guantanamo military commissions. Within the first 15 minutes, the judge had to adjourn the pre-trial hearing in the case of the five defendants accused of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, this time because one of the defendants had asked a question. And no one knew the answer.Senior Counsel, Law and Security Program, Human Rights FirstIf you\u0027re a Republican like Jeb Bush, and your brother also happens to be responsible for the worst military blunder in American history, the subject of the September 11 attacks can be very confusing and complicated.Political and Pop Culture AnalystDemocrats are left with a difficult choice. Either choose the ideological purist, or the one who can win. It\u0027s not an easy choice to make when you look at the state of the Republican primary.Student at Towson UniversityThe close divisions on the Court on these and other issues, coupled with the fact that four will be over 80 in the next president\u0027s first term, show the importance of the 2016 election on the future of the Court -- and why November 8, 2016 truly will be Judgment Day.Senior Fellow, People For the American Way and People For the American Way FoundationDiplomacy doesn\u0027t promise a speedy end to the almost unfathomable suffering in the region, but it does offer a potential path to a different history, a path away from ceaseless violence and toward the imperfect rule of law.Executive Director, National Priorities ProjectWriter; Senior Advisor, National Priorities ProjectBernie blew it. By embracing rather than confronting Hillary Clinton, Sen. Sanders fell into the trap of sellout mainstream politics, improving his personal brand as an appealing but ultimately non-threatening advocate for the downtrodden while studiously avoiding any suggestion that the smiley-faced woman standing next to him is deeply complicit in Wall Street\u0027s rape of the nation.Editor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027They Know Everything About You\u0027Deadly, debilitating diseases don\u0027t care if you\u0027re liberal or conservative. The hyper-politicization of biomedical research threatens future life-saving medical advancements.Wisconsin State Representative. Progressive. Advocate. Mother. Former Planned Parenthood Policy Director. Attorney.TEL AVIV -- Foreign analysts have been quick to claim that recent events are about Al Aqsa, and they\u0027ve been even quicker to argue about whether or not this is a third intifada. But both discussions miss the point.Tel Aviv-based journalist and writerThe presumption of innocence, the benefit of the doubt, walking without worrying -- these should not be hallmarks of white privilege. They are human rights that should be enjoyed by all.President, American Federation of TeachersDear !: You were supposed to be \"the smart one.\" So, before you get yourself deeper in dog doo-doo. Bottom line: \"he kept us safe\" doesn\u0027t pass the smell test. I suggest you sing a different (swan?) song.Last person on Earth not on FacebookNow I understand that it wasn\u0027t about being a perfect person so much as it was about being a good human being. I\u0027m not glad that you struggled. But I\u0027m glad we got to see your struggle. We don\u0027t always fully understand the purpose in parents\u0027 decisions and behavior until we\u0027re parents ourselves.Author, poet, humorist, avid reader. Wife of one, mama of six. Blogger at Crash Test Parents and Racheltoalson.comAs with any thinking person, Miller\u0027s politics evolved, but he always believed in civil liberties and the right of artists, and all people, to express themselves freely. Although he later rejected the Marxism of his youth, he never lost his commitment to progressive causes and democratic rights.E.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeThe 2016 race probably saw a inflection point this week when Hillary imitated Ginger Rogers dancing backwards in heels better than Astaire. Frum-Alter debate if there\u0027s any way she can be stopped, will Biden run, and who\u0027s on her short-list as VP (yeah, too soon).Host, \u0027Both Sides Now\u0027Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
