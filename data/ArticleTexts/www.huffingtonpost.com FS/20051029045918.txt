READ MOREFitzgerald Beans Libby, Metaphorically Speaking If the coming trial comes to a metaphoric showdown between the literary skills of Pat Fitzgerald and Scooter Libby, my money is on the prosecutor. I\u0027ll take \"obstruction of justice is like throwing sand in the umpire\u0027s eyes\" over \"aspens turn in clusters because their roots connect them\" any day of the week.

One day a great gift like Libby, the next day a pair of socks (Ari Fleischer), the next day, who knows: maybe an Xbox 360 (Karl Rove)!READ POST | comments (60)10.28.2005 Youssef M.

John ConyersI have directed my staff to conduct a comprehensive investigation -- not only of alleged efforts to misuse the White House to out a CIA operative, but all legal violations and breaches of trust by the administration concerning the war.READ POST | comments (53)10.28.2005 Timothy NaftaliThe clandestine war between the Office of the Vice President and the CIA should be front and center at the Libby trial.READ POST | comments (13)10.28.2005 Katrina vanden HeuvelYou were indicted in the Fall. It is still Fall. You fell down the stairs and broke your foot. It would be terrible if you fell down the stairs again and broke your skull. Do the thirty years.

For them, it\u0027s sexy to speculate about a pre-emptive pardon, but it\u0027s wonky to actually investigate a pre-emptive war.READ POST | comments (18)10.28.2005 Tina BrownThe letter Libby wrote Judith Miller was not a message in code meant to influence Miller\u0027s legal strategy. It was the voice of Libby the novelist...already turning his thoughts to how his life would change after his career ended with an indictment.READ POST | comments (23)10.28.2005 Paul BegalaAs a former Clinton aide, the indictment of Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby gives me no schadenfreude. But it\u0027s telling that the first time anyone had the courage to scratch the surface of Bush, Inc., he found corruption.READ POST | comments (103)10.28.2005 Nathan GardelsAs the White House case for war has been further discredited with the indictment of Scooter Libby, the credibility of the maverick former UN arms inspector Scott Ritter has grown even greater.
