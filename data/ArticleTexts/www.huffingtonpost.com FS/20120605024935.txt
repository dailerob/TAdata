{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Associate professor, historian, authorThe measly 69,000 jobs added last month and the shrinking job count over the past few months illustrate our \"new normal.\" At this snail\u0027s pace it will take a couple of decades before we get back to the \"good old days\" of the 2005 unemployment rate. Combine this with the bipartisan denuding of the public sector in the form of cutbacks and layoffs, and it\u0027s no surprise that we\u0027re in store for a long period of economic insecurity and malaise. Like Bill Clinton, who normalized Ronald Reagan\u0027s trade, deregulation, antitrust, and welfare policies, giving them the bipartisan sheen of Washington orthodoxy, Barack Obama has normalized George W. Bush\u0027s Wall Street, education, and \"anti-terrorism\" policies. So, welcome to the new normal, where Wall Street criminals go free, whistleblowers are prosecuted, and tens of millions are unemployed.Read Post | Comments (12)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 06/04/12Author, \u0027Our Fathers, Ourselves. Daughters, Fathers, and the Changing American Family\u0027As Americans rinse off the stench of the long sad Edwards affair, we find ourselves wondering yet again: how did this happen?Read Post | Comments (92)Marty Kaplan, 06/04/12Director, Norman Lear Center and Professor at the USC Annenberg SchoolDavid Brooks writes that, \"Many people today have not been given vocabularies to talk about what virtue is...\" The trouble isn\u0027t that we lack a moral vocabulary; it\u0027s that that language has long been a mask for wielding power.Read Post | Comments (70)Alanis Morissette, 06/04/12Grammy-winning musician and actressIt seems as though a healthy moderate version of parenting -- where our shame about our bodies and our sexuality, our traumas and our resistances to connection are addressed -- is where most of us, ultimately, really want to fall.Read Post | Comments (136)James Franco, 06/04/12Actor and authorI am not a sports fan, but that didn\u0027t keep me from loving If I Don\u0027t Six by Elwood Reid. There is something more to this book that takes it out of the sports fiction genre and brings it into the realm of literary fiction.Read Post | CommentsBernard-Henri Lévy, 06/04/12French philosopher and writerFrom one side of the political spectrum nearly to the other, disapproval was unanimous. However, this affair (three young Jews assaulted with blows from hammers and iron bars last Saturday in Villeurbanne) remains eminently troubling.Read Post | CommentsBarbara Hannah Grufferman, 06/04/12Writer; Speaker; Author, \u0027The Best of Everything After 50\u0027How can we believe what the media is telling us if we\u0027re not getting the full story and if we consistently ignore the voice of more than half this country?Read Post | CommentsAlex McCord, 06/04/12Author, Mom, TV PersonalityHow low would you go to catch your partner cheating?Read Post | CommentsDean Baker, 06/04/12Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Alan Simpson, the foul-mouthed former senator, is back in the news. He once again launched an obscenity-laden diatribe against those who oppose his plans to cut Social Security and Medicare. Unfortunately, the focus of the media attention has been on the senator\u0027s use of obscenities.Read Post | CommentsTheresa Payton, 06/04/12Author and Cyber Expert on \"America Now\"With the new direction of Facebook and the new privacy policy about to come out, where do you stand? Will you use Facebook less or more? Will you delete your account?Read Post | CommentsRev. Al Sharpton, 06/04/12President, National Action NetworkToday, in the city of NY, we are facing another troubling form of biased profiling and searches known as \u0027Stop-and-Frisk.\u0027 Only difference is, this time, you can be targeted for simply walking down the street.Read Post | CommentsRobert Kuttner, 06/04/12Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Because Germany, uniquely among European nations, is enjoying an economic boom, it will take real courage for the German Social Democrats to propose a fundamentally different course.Read Post | Comments (257)Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, 06/04/12U.S. Senator from MarylandAmerican women are mad as hell, and we\u0027re not going to take it anymore. It\u0027s time to close the loopholes, level the playing field and end the outrageous cost of being a woman. It\u0027s time to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and once and for all have equal pay for equal work.Read Post | Comments (32)Ingrid Newkirk, 06/04/12President and co-founder, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA)June is Adopt-a-Shelter-Cat Month, and I implore anyone who has the time, resources, energy, and love to devote to a cat to consider opening your heart and home to a feline (or two!) in need. Shelters are overflowing with cats of every stripe, from frisky kittens to loyal \"lap cats.\"Read Post | CommentsMark Hyman, MD, 06/03/12Practicing physicianEach of us has the capacity to make the small changes in our lives that will create big changes in our food landscape, our agriculture and even our government policies.Read Post | Comments (362)Maureen Ryan, 06/04/12TV critic, The Huffington PostThe finale may have been a bit overstuffed, but Season 2 as a whole has been tremendously satisfying, given how well it has distilled George R.R. Martin\u0027s themes with coherence, compassion and spectacular visuals.Read Post | Comments (336)Leo W. Gerard, 06/04/12International President, United SteelworkersRomney is loving high unemployment. Just like the Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives that has repeatedly blocked President Obama\u0027s proposals to increase hiring, Romney believes high joblessness is good for the GOP.Read Post | Comments (984)Cara Santa Maria, 06/01/12Science correspondent, Huffington Post; editor, Talk Nerdy to MeTomorrow is the big day. Time to dust off your eclipse glasses, binoculars and posterboard, or pinhole camera and witness the transit of Venus, a once in a lifetime event!Read Post | Comments (447)Jennifer Nagy, 06/04/12Public Relations ProfessionalPeople under the age of 25 are still discovering themselves; they are figuring out what is most important in their livesRead Post | Comments (637)Bill McKibben, 06/04/12Author of a dozen books, including \u0027The End of Nature\u0027 and \u0027Deep Economy\u0027Because the GOP has been so unreasonable, the President clearly feels he can take the environmental vote by staying silent, which means the odds that he\u0027ll do anything dramatic in the next four years grow steadily smaller.Read Post | Comments (107)Eli Lehrer, 06/04/12President, R StreetSimply wishing that government would vanish is no substitute for figuring out how to run it. If libertarians want the fusionist alliance to keep going and the political right to remain in power, they\u0027re going to have to stop being nuts.Read Post | Comments (658)Soraya Chemaly, 06/04/12Feminist, Satirist and Media CriticI knew men invented fire and water and are probably responsible for figuring out how to make a thumb opposable. But the INTERNET? I had NO IDEA.Read Post | Comments (39)Rep. Luis Gutierrez, 06/04/12Congressman Representing Illinois\u0027 4th District in ChicagoAs Chief Executive, President Obama has extraordinary leeway under our current immigration laws to prevent the deportation of certain immigrants if it is not in our national interest to deport them.Read Post | Comments (35)Juliette Fretté, 06/03/12Writer and Modern FeministAh, how nice it is to have a product exploring women\u0027s pleasure, one that doesn\u0027t undermine our confidence or power in the way that many beauty products and home cleaning supplies do.Read Post | Comments (146)Nancy Keenan, 06/04/12President, NARALIn the first five months of 2012, the anti-choice House leadership has lined up no fewer than five separate bills with anti-choice provisions for floor action. It\u0027s amazing they can keep a straight face when they say there\u0027s no War on Women.Read Post | Comments (143)Tamika D. Mallory and Marvin Bing, 06/04/12\u0027Stop and frisk\u0027 criminalizes our youth, creates further distrust between the community and police, and doesn\u0027t do a thing to keep us safer. It used to be that we feared driving while Black; in New York and around the nation, we now fear simply walking down the street while Black or Latino.Read Post | Comments (47)Ingrid Newkirk, 2012. 4.06Bernard-Henri Lévy, 2012. 4.06Judge Michele F.
