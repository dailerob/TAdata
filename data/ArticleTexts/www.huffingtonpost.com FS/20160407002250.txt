{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few\u0027\u0027A crowning achievement of the historic March on Washington, where Dr. Martin Luther King gave his “I have a dream” speech, was pushing through the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965. Recognizing the history of racist attempts to prevent Black people from voting, that federal law forced a number of southern states and districts to adhere to federal guidelines allowing citizens access to the polls. But in 2013 the Supreme Court effectively gutted many of these protections. As a result, states are finding new ways to stop more and more people — especially African-Americans and other likely Democratic voters — from reaching the polls. Voting isn’t a privilege. It’s a right. And that right is too important to be left to partisan politics.I recently had the pleasure of speaking with Jennifer Aniston, who is not only one of our most gifted actors but a lifestyle icon for millions. In a conversation that touched on a range of well-being topics, I couldn\u0027t resist asking her about the one that happens to be one of our shared passions: sleep. From her bedtime ritual to her favorite dry shampoo, she shared some of her struggles as well as some of her tips for powering down and getting the sleep she needs.Rather than reflexively continue sanctions, the Western states should rethink their policy toward Russia. Vladimir Putin isn\u0027t a nice guy, but that hardly sets him apart. Russian democracy may be an oxymoron, but then, lack of civil and political rights never stopped Washington from backing Egypt, aiding Pakistan, or embracing Saudi Arabia.Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteIs it making up for (decades of) lost time? Having an entire issue to plus size women only serves to highlight how exclusive the magazine is the other 11 months of the year -- and has been every year since it first launched in 1939.Senior Lifestyle Editor of The Huffington Post UKIn states across the country, transgender young people have had to listen to their government speak about them as \"twisted\" and try to cast them out of public space. Despite all the vitriol, the trans community continues to show up and lead the fight to stop these bills. But we\u0027re not alone in this fight.Attorney; founding board member, Lorena Borjas Community FundAs the campaign heads into the home stretch, Sanders has more momentum than ever. But despite his recent victories, he still faces one daunting and inescapable problem: the Democratic superdelegates overwhelmingly support Clinton.Independent source of news and analysis, from the academic and research community.Waiting for someone else to die so your spouse can live is an awful position. But that\u0027s exactly what we were doing, hoping to take advantage of someone else\u0027s misfortune. Looking back, it\u0027s clear the transplant system in this country is an abject disaster.Sr. video producer, CNBC.comWhite pain is just taken more seriously than Black pain. If my mom\u0027s race affected her medical treatment and, ultimately, shortened her life, she wouldn\u0027t have been the first and won\u0027t be the last Black person that happens to. And that is not an abstraction.Co-founder and editor-in-chief, VSB MagazineAfter the Paris terrorist attacks, 31 governors said that they wanted no more Syrians admitted to their states. In the months since, Syrian refugees across the country had the opportunity to respond. Their message is simple: get to know us.Director of Immigration Policy, Niskanen CenterTravel takes us out of ourselves and opens us to new ideas, new places, and ultimately a more accommodating frame of mind. On the return from Nicaragua, our plane was delayed, and none of us minded in the slightest.Editor-at-large, Town \u0026 CountryIf there is one place in this country where we know what a buffoon, charlatan, fraud, and phony Donald Trump is, it is right here in his hometown of New York City.Political Activist, Social Change Media Maker, Prepper and Mom.There is a significant opportunity to make financial wellness a real part of our lives -- reversing the course of crippling financial stress while we rewrite our engagement with a flawed financial system designed to profit from our habits and dependence on debt.Financial Wellness Entrepreneur. Founder, CEO at PayoffThe Associated Press\u0027s decision to end the use of the phrase \"child prostitute\" is not only a win for accuracy in reporting, but it will go a long way toward changing attitudes about girls who are victims of child sex trafficking.Executive Director of Rights4GirlsIt had been ages since I\u0027d read a fairytale, but my daughter is now old enough to get among them so I bought a big colourful collection (which, shamefully, attracted GST) and set about frightening the bejesus out of her.Blog Editor, HuffPost AustraliaUntil the fire in Syria is extinguished, every effort must be made to keep the lid on that boiling pot, by easing the pressures on host communities and strengthening the individual and collective resilience of refugee and host community populations together. This is where sport has a role to contribute.Founder and Chairman of Generations For Peace\"What I would want most people to know is that they shouldn\u0027t give up. With you, I didn\u0027t know what you would be capable of doing. My job as a mom was to prepare you for life -- whatever that was going to look like. And so I kept raising the bar for you, and you kept meeting every expectation.\"Engagement Specialist, trainer, advocate, parentSouth Korea claims that North Korea has miniaturized a nuclear warhead to fit on the tip of a missile. They are probably right.President, Ploughshares Fund; Author, \u0027Nuclear Nightmares: Securing the World Before It Is Too Late\u0027It was the first electoral test since Trump\u0027s disastrous nuke and abortion mistakes last week and shows that, unless he can reverse the damage, he may just have peaked. That will likely result in a hung primary outcome and a brokered convention where Trump is decidedly the least favorite.Senior Fellow Atlantic Council Eurasia Section in Washington DC, Adjunct Faculty Singularity University in Mountain Vie the National Post in Canada, a Distinguished Professor at Ryerson University’s Ted Rogers School of Management, author of 10 booksThere\u0027s been lots of debate about whether the press \"created\" Trump\u0027s front-runner status via its obsessive (and often subservient) coverage. But it\u0027s also important to focus on the sheer tonnage of the Trump coverage and the wild inequity on display.Senior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaDespite needing rest, many parents push through fatigue to watch one more episode of their favorite show, or to scroll through a few more Facebook posts. Our children follow our lead, postponing shut-eye in whatever clever ways they can.Family therapist, Author, Parenting With Presence, Parenting Without Power StrugglesWhen the basic needs of life are denied, resentment against the \"other\" can fester. Racial, ethnic and religious divisions can be exploited and can erupt into communal violence. But in Kerala, where equality and development are driving forces, peace has become ingrained.Founder and CEO of the Global Institute For TomorrowThe fact that a woman is expected to change her last name when she gets married seems a bit off to me. Call me a feminist. (I am.) Call me a bitter divorcée. (I\u0027m not.) But why is it on us to change our names? Why do we have to remove the name we were born with? Why do we have to erase part of who we are?The StirHere\u0027s the truth: Hillary Clinton got very little done during her eight years in the United States Senate, while Bernie Sanders amassed an impressive record of accomplishments in both the House and Senate.Writer/Editor, Bernie 2016Taking a moment to hit pause on life, and to stand back and really look at my son, it makes me proud, happy and I feel incredibly blessed.Journalist based in OsloMindful practices, such as daily meditation, prayer, journaling or jogging, enable leaders to become more creative and open to new ideas. For Iger, this means waking up every morning at 4:30 a.m. to be aloneSenior Fellow, Harvard Business SchoolRefugees often come to refugee camps scarred by the extreme violence at home, by torture to their own bodies, by witnessing death and maiming in both private and public spaces in Syria. Many suffer from PTSD, depression, schizophrenia, anxiety, the stress from living in crowded and poorly serviced camps, and from lack of money or work.Louise Hewlett Nixon Professor, Stanford UniversityAs a mother, I\u0027ve learned to never wait to be approached. Feel your child out by asking questions. Get the answers, and then see what stage your child is in. I believe the line of communication should always be open and your child should always feel comfortable asking questionsMommy Mogul, Co-founder of PitCCh In FoundationWhile the media continued saying, \"It\u0027s all about the math, stupid,\" a small cadre of political observers -- along with the almost 50 percent of Democrats who now support Senator Sanders -- began to see the obvious: the math wasn\u0027t going to get Clinton to a point where she could clinch the Democratic nomination with just pledged delegates.Assistant Professor of English at University of New Hampshire; Series Co-Editor, Best American Experimental WritingLike most people, I stay connected with friends via Facebook. What used to be a \"Steve is in a relationship\" update has been replaced with \"Steve is a sexist and/or racist pig\" update. I thought I knew Steve.Writer, Comedian, Cat OwnerThis political revolution, ignited by Bernie Sanders and fought for by people of all races, faiths, and ethnic backgrounds across the U.S. has been bolstered by political momentum. It\u0027s not current delegate count or prior poll numbers, it\u0027s unprecedented political momentum that will win Sanders the Democratic nomination.Columnist published in The Cleveland Plain Dealer, The Baltimore Sun, The Hill, Salon, The Jerusalem Post www.hagoodman.comIn February 2014, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) unveiled plans to overhaul the Nutrition Facts panel required on packaged foods in the U.S. Among the proposed updates, FDA plans to revise the serving sizes to reflect more typical serving sizes.Internationally-recognized nutritionist; International Speaker; Adjunct professor of nutrition at NYU; Author, \u0027The Portion Teller Plan\u0027Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
