{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersHow would you feel if you realized your children\u0027s water was being poisoned, and your government didn\u0027t seem to care? That\u0027s the story of the parents of 8,000 mostly poor and black children in Flint, Mich., that has finally hit our media front pages. The fact that most Americans realize this would never happen in affluent white Michigan suburbs (or any other white affluent communities in our country), still doesn\u0027t penetrate our very souls. This fundamental contrast between black and white experiences in Michigan, just north of my hometown of Detroit, points to the structural racism that is still the primary moral contradiction of American life.I understand that many white men -- and women and people of color as well -- who have been left out of this economy, who can\u0027t make ends meet, who feel that the American dream is not working for them, are very angry about this, and justifiably so. But I cannot countenance the misdirection of their anger.President of the Democracy AllianceIf the real intellectual and heart-cleansing message of Islam is not publicized or promoted, then the field is left to the belligerents and deadly aspirants of Armageddon. Why do beautiful things have such a hard time being noticed? Can\u0027t we try a bit harder to get back on that \"Peace Train\" again?Musician, Artist, Writer, Producer and PhilanthropistBack in 2014, Dunham\u0027s memoir, Not That Kind of Girl, included a list of things that keep her up at night. Meanwhile, a realistic, yet not overly dramatized depiction of OCD gets a good amount of screen time on Girls in the form of Dunham\u0027s character. But is there such a thing as too revealing?Author, research psychologist and gender scholarI appreciate the new rhetoric from the many candidates saying that drug use and addiction are a health issue, not a criminal issue. But there\u0027s a huge disconnect between this rhetoric and their actual policy proposals.Director of Media Relations, Drug Policy AllianceI will vote for Hillary with my head and my heart. I will be hopeful that a woman who does think before she speaks is not completely perceived as \"guarded,\" because a man who thinks before he speaks is called \"thoughtful.\"ActressThe bad news for Cruz was that because Trump wasn\u0027t present to take incoming from all the challengers, Cruz became the target of attacks from most of the other candidates.Hofstra Journalism ProfessorKenneth Thorpe, an Emory University professor who served in the Clinton administration, claims Sanders\u0027s single-payer plan would break the bank. But his analysis rests on several incorrect, and occasionally outlandish, assumptions.Professor of Public Health at CUNY and Lecturer in Medicine at Harvard Medical SchoolProfessor in the CUNY School of Public Health at Hunter College; Lecturer in Medicine, Harvard Medical SchoolWe each have an opportunity and responsibility -- as parents, children, friends, neighbors, business owners, employees, tax payers, citizens, and Americans -- to push the government, food industry, media, restaurants, cafes, schools, and workplaces, and everywhere else we eat, away from the bad and ugly and toward the good.Cardiologist, nutrition scientist, public health advocate and Dean, Friedman School of Nutrition Science \u0026 Policy, Tufts UniversityThere are men in our communities who are predators and pedophiles. But not all men are like that. You are not like that. So I\u0027m asking you: will you please be our protectors? Would you be a voice of conscience to the men around you?Writer-mama and Jesus-girlHillary may have foreign policy experience, but when push came to shove, she showed an extreme lack of judgment on the most important foreign policy decision in a generation.Entertainment attorney, producer, writer and political activistPity poor Washington. No doubt breaking the hearts of elected and appointed government officials, their staffs and hangers-on, a blog at the Center for Responsive Politics reports that the \"influence industry appears to be contracting, and the trend continued in 2015.\"Senior writer, BillMoyers.com. Former senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.Political commitment and investment in breastfeeding by governments, donors, employers and civil society is urgently needed to ensure the health of women and children and to shape a more sustainable future for all.Chief of Nutrition, UNICEFFederal law has banned pay discrimination since 1963. But more than 50 years later, many in the American workplace -- because of their sex, race or ethnicity -- don\u0027t get equal pay for equal work.U.S. Secretary of LaborSenior Advisor to the President and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsChair of the Equal Employment Opportunity CommissionAllow me to let you in on a little secret: I, like presumably most Americans who support Bernie Sanders, do not expect miracles. But if Bernie Sanders is elected president, then maybe, just maybe, things will change. And that\u0027s worth a vote. That\u0027s worth trying.Radio/Podcast Producer \u0026 Host at WGN Radio, ChicagoAccording to an article, these are the things men find unattractive about us women, written by a woman. But if you want me to love my man just the way he is, then he can sure as f*ck love me the way I am.Lover of slayers, hobbits, zombies and time lordsThe road to my caucus location in Iowa on Monday will wind along an Iowa River valley littered with the reminders of record flooding and drought since the last election -- and a sea change on voters\u0027 priorities on climate action since 2008.Author of \"Damnatio Memoriae: A Play, Una Commedia,\" www.jeffbiggers.comThe absence of Donald Trump was a breath of fresh air, providing all of us with a greater focus on the issues. But the temperamental Trump wasn\u0027t the only loser, as some of the GOP candidates stumbled during the Fox News Channel debate.Political science professor, LaGrange College in GeorgiaIf the U.S. is to be heard in the Muslim world, it will have to downplay all it believes true and blue -- and instead promote moderate, but illiberal Islam.Professor of international relations, George Washington UniversityThere is so much beauty in the world. All you have to do is leave your comfort zone to see it.Associate Editor, Blogs \u0026 CommunityAs someone who has both crafted and professionally scoffed at headlines in many ways through many elections, I\u0027d like to just reassure everyone, right now, that yes, your instincts are correct: most of the ones you\u0027ll see after the Iowa caucus will be absurd and should be ignored.Writer, layabout and all-around nogoodnik; web publisher; former Associate News Editor, The Huffington PostIt may be 100 years before history can assess the role that this one human being called Marvin Minsky played in transforming our world. The impact of artificial intelligence -- so pervasive, so woven into the fabric of all that we do and think -- would not be as it is had Marvin not been among us.Creator \u0026 Host, Closer to TruthTrump is a reality star known for his business acumen, his parade of wives, (two of three are immigrants) and finally, his inability to display even the tiniest bit of sophistication, restraint, and civility when it comes to women\u0027s rights.DuPont and Peabody award-winning journalistI think there are many things you could call me. You could call me stubborn. You could call me opinionated. You could even call me anxious -- when I am anxious. Just don\u0027t let that be the benchmark for my health care, or a convenient thing to write when you can\u0027t find anything else wrong, or are so intent on not listening to me that you can\u0027t hear me.Author; Blogger, 37days.comAfter 10 years as a business owner, I encountered a specific kind of sexism this week that I\u0027ve actually never come across before.Founder, EdgarIn our house we now have many beds, some king-sized, others single, and we swap and change according to weather, mood, snoring level and tolerance.Novelist, obituary writer, cancer survivorVarious expressions of regret and statements acknowledging the role of the Japanese military in operating the \"comfort women\" system have been made, but none have unconditionally acknowledged that Japan as a state was responsible for these violations.President, International Center for Transitional JusticeWhat\u0027s really causing the growing gap between haves and have-nots? Is it mechanical market forces? Outsourcing? Real estate?Author and cultural theoristClinton might be \"wicked smart,\" like President Obama states, but Bernie Sanders possesses wisdom. Wisdom and intelligence are different, and if you confuse the two, you\u0027re stuck with an endless stream of politicians like Hillary Clinton. With Bernie Sanders, America will get someone who makes decisions based upon principle and value system, not political expediency and evolution.Columnist published in The Cleveland Plain Dealer, The Baltimore Sun, The Hill, Salon, The Jerusalem Post www.hagoodman.comRacism in America may be seen as a problem generally...but it\u0027s not seen as a problem for us -- for upper-middle class white people attending a white church and, for the most part, living in white suburbia.Author of Spiritual Misfit: A Memoir of Uneasy Faith and 50 Women Every Christian Should Know; from Lincoln, Nebraska.We\u0027ve never seen a real alien. Indeed, we don\u0027t even know if real aliens exist. However, astronomers have recently discovered several thousand planets in our galactic neighborhood. Consequently, the idea of intelligent life in space has eased from the realm of science fiction to scientific plausibility.Associate Professor of Philosophy at the Cognitive Science program at the University of ConnecticutSenior Astronomer, SETI InstituteGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.
