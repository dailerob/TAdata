{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Senior columnist for life/work/family, The Huffington PostThere has been much written about how we are smothering our children, and worrying about the wrong dangers, and cocooning them in bubblewrap. And, statistically, that advice is right. But statistics don\u0027t mean a thing on days like these. Because, after all, the roots of our foreboding lie in the days that make this one feel eerily familiar. We have watched this loop before, in Colorado, and Virginia, and Arizona, and Toronto. We know that while we are being reassured that the world is basically safe, and we are overreacting to the dangers, somehow a series of lunatics keep finding a way to get guns and aim them at our kids. Today, I will hug my children, and cry for the victims they could have been. I will get angry at the world that allows a midnight movie to become a massacre. And I won\u0027t let them out of my sight.Read Post | Comments (209)Chris Kelly, 07/20/12Writer, \u0027Real Time with Bill Maher\u0027Twelve people were killed last night, apparently, by a rifle and a handgun and the faulty wiring inside the head of an alleged gunman named James Holmes. And our response -- America\u0027s response -- is going to be nothing.Read Post | Comments (363)Matthew Chapman, 07/20/12Writer, director, \"The Ledge\"As someone who grew up in a place where guns designed to kill people are more or less banned, I often wonder what it will take for Americans to absolutely reject organizations that are obsessed with the Second Amendment, an element of the constitution that is anachronistic, poorly written, unclear, and insanely stupid given modern weaponry.Read Post | Comments (745)Arianna Huffington, 07/20/12In 1962, Rachel Carson began sounding the alarm about the dangers of exposure to chemicals and the failure of the industry and regulators to protect people from those dangers. Fifty years later, Lynne Peeples\u0027s anniversary feature in Huffington is a reminder that we have failed to heed many of Carson\u0027s warnings, especially when it comes to protecting our most precious resource, our children.Read Post | Comments (152)Michael Shank, 07/20/12U.S. Vice President, Institute for Economics and PeaceThe tragic Colorado theater shooting must stimulate a debate on more than mere gun control. Here\u0027s why.Read Post | Comments (102)Paul Brandeis Raushenbush, 07/20/12Senior Religion Editor, The Huffington PostIf we respond too soon we do not honor those victims who have died, and those who continue to suffer. Instead, our reactions serve the idols of our own agendas and ideas.Read Post | Comments (14)Marian Wright Edelman, 07/20/12President, Children\u0027s Defense FundEvery time a child is excluded from school by adults or is chronically absent without any actions to determine why, we are failing the child and undercutting the importance of education. Hundreds of years after Americans first made that connection, what will it take for us to get it again today?Read Post | CommentsMenachem Rosensaft, 07/20/12Professor of law and son of Holocaust survivorsI was born in the Displaced Persons camp of Bergen-Belsen in Germany in 1948. From the day I became a naturalized US citizen, I have been as much an American as anyone.

The world\u0027s highest-value, largest and most dynamic industries are no longer America\u0027s. There is only one global industry that America truly dominates: Facebook.

But, yesterday\u0027s U.N. vote, the third veto from the Russia Federation on the issue of Syria alone, is proof that the Obama strategy has failed.Read Post | CommentsDavid Katz, M.D., 07/20/12Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterThe way we respond to obesity and related chronic disease in the U.S. is like waiting to send every adult to night school to learn English -- painfully, poorly, expensively, and late -- rather than having them grow up speaking fluently all along.Read Post | Comments (17)Mark Gongloff, 07/20/12Chief financial writer, The Huffington PostSo far Barclays has been the sad, British face of the Libor scandal, but there could soon come a day when an American bank could be the poster child for Libor manipulation.Read Post | Comments (74)Norm Schriever, 07/20/12Author of \"Pushups in the Prayer Room\"The dusky streets were packed with paunchy and pale older white guys, wearing socks and sandals and chain smoking, arm in arm with attractive Filipina ladies thirty years their junior.Read Post | Comments (26)Nina Burleigh, 07/19/12Journalist; Author, \u0027The Fatal Gift of Beauty\u0027 and forthcoming book on women and IslamistsIt should come as no surprise that Michele Bachmann claims Huma Abedin, an aide to Hilary Clinton, might be a Muslim Brotherhood spy sent to influence the highest levels of America\u0027s foreign policy.Read Post | Comments (314)Jill Di Donato, 07/19/12Writer, Adjunct Professor of English, The Fashion Institute of Technology, New YorkI started asking real women to tell me what parts of them they want their partners to focus on in bed.
