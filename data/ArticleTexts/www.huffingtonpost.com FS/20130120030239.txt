{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Executive International Editor, The Huffington PostA number of polls published before the U.S. presidential election in November indicated that, on a global level, if the world could vote, they would have re-elected President Barack Obama by a wide margin. But recognizing that most of the world wanted Obama isn\u0027t the same as knowing what the world wants from Obama. To help us better understand what some of those things might be, we turned to HuffPost\u0027s international editions -- in the UK, Canada, France, Spain and Italy -- for a collection of articles as part of our series \"THE ROAD FORWARD: Obama\u0027s Second Term Challenges.\" The hope is that these pieces, written by our reporters in these countries, will illuminate how the world outside America views the challenges and possibilities facing a leader whose personal appeal still looms larger than his presidential accomplishments.Read Post | Comments (421)David Bromwich, 01/19/13Professor of Literature at YaleThe answers given by Bigelow and Boal to justify the normalizing of torture in Zero Dark Thirty have been vain, wheedling, and dodgy. They are a clever pair of filmmakers, without political or moral depth, but here, perhaps more than they realized, they were playing with fire.Read Post | CommentsMarian Wright Edelman, 01/19/13President, Children\u0027s Defense FundDr. King is not coming back.

But it\u0027s key to encourage boys to look to other, perhaps less conventional role models for examples of how they might want to live and grow.Read Post | Comments (84)Alexander Tsiaras, 01/18/13Founder, CEO and Editor-in-Chief, TheVisualMD.comMy goal is to visualize life in all its glory.

But you often play with a speech the night before or enroute -- so how about your last Inaugural? Because it requires a thematic spine that endures, may I suggest one that emerges out of your books, talks, presidency: MoneyOut/VotersIn. Until we have a democracy-for-all, your progressive priorities may be stymied by the billionaires, super PACs and suppression that just tried to buy and steal our elections. They\u0027ll be back.Read Post | CommentsMichael Hogan, 01/19/13Executive Arts and Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post Media GroupPlenty of male actors have passionately kissed male co-stars in films, as Radcliffe and the excellent Dane DeHaan do here, but it\u0027s hard to recall a Hollywood star as famous as this one simulating the act of homosexual lovemaking this explicitly or this vulnerably.Read Post | CommentsJeffrey Young, 01/18/13Huffington Post Health Care ReporterThe current flu season already has claimed the lives of 29 children, the CDC said Friday.

Squires, 01/18/13Professor of sociology, public policy and public administration, George Washington UniversityObama owes quite a bit to the black community, but not because of the vote, his color or even the presumably more liberal politics of his Democratic Party but because the federal government, among others, has an obligation to address the continuing significance of race in America.Read Post | Comments (125)Susie Pearl, 01/18/13Happiness, Well-Being ActivistAs we enter into the swing of a bright new year full of potential, many of us are busy setting up new plans and ideas for the coming months.Read Post | Comments (60)Jim Wallis, 01/18/13Christian leader for social changeWayne LaPierre\u0027s statement \"the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun\" is at the heart of the problem of gun violence in America today -- not just because it is factually flawed, but also because it is morally mistaken, theologically dangerous, and religiously repugnant.Read Post | Comments (463)Sierra Black, 01/18/13Writer, activist, motherSometimes, open relationships just suck.
