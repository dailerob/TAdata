{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Journalist; Author, \u0027The Fatal Gift of Beauty\u0027 and forthcoming book on women and IslamistsIt should come as no surprise that Michele Bachmann claims Huma Abedin, an aide to Hilary Clinton, might be a Muslim Brotherhood spy sent to influence the highest levels of America\u0027s foreign policy. Conspiracy theorizing, the classic Middle Eastern method of decoding power, is alive and well on the American right. It is so easy to be a bumptious average American about the Middle East. It\u0027s such a confusing place. But Bachmann sits on the House Intelligence Committee with access to intelligence that most do not receive.

It didn\u0027t make sense to me, and it did not seem right.

Marc Ginsberg, 07/19/12Former U.S. Ambassador to MoroccoIt is extremely difficult to decipher what and who has taken up arms against each other inside the war-torn nation.
