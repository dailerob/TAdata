{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editor, Eat the PressSpend enough time dipping into the post-game reaction of NRA leader Wayne LaPierre\u0027s press conference today -- staged and performed as the organization\u0027s first public statement since the tragic school shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. -- and you\u0027ll likely run up on any number of people who\u0027ll tell you the LaPierre\u0027s presentation (which included calls for more guns in schools and greater restrictions on video games) was tone-deaf or ineffective or out-of-touch or a failure. Those critics are wrong. LaPierre\u0027s presentation was terrifically effective. The NRA are lobbyists who represent a bunch of gun retailers, and this is what lobbyists do -- they help their clients sell their products. And every action that LaPierre took today can and should be viewed through that prism.Read Post | Comments (1,523)Cory Booker, 12/21/12Mayor of NewarkHere are gun law reforms that alone will save thousands upon thousands of Americans, and joined with other reasonable reforms, can truly turn the tide on gun violence in this country.Read Post | Comments (285)Phil Plait, 12/21/12Astronomer, AuthorIt only takes one asteroid, 100 or so meters across, impacting the Earth to explode with the force of a dozen nuclear weapons. This is something we might wish to avoid! So what do we do?Read Post | Comments (203)Bob Cesca, 12/21/12Political Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowUltimately, video games, television and so forth are only reflections of American culture and consumer demand. If we break the culture, if we disrupt the firearm marketplace, consumer demand and the media marketplace will begin to adjust accordingly.Read Post | Comments (141)Marlo Thomas, 12/21/12Award-winning actress, author and activistWinter time can be wonderful. But when the sun has been hiding for weeks on end and you\u0027re cooped up in the house, it\u0027s easy to go stir crazy - I know I do. Rather than slipping into a winter funk, use these dark days as an opportunity to get organized, get motivated and try your hand at something new.Read Post | Comments (30)Robert Reich, 12/21/12Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027This has become a party of hypocrisy masquerading as principled ideology. The GOP talks endlessly about the importance of reducing the budget deficit. But it isn\u0027t even willing to raise revenues from the richest three-tenths of one percent of Americans to help with the task.Read Post | Comments (610)Joe Peyronnin, 12/21/12Hofstra Journalism ProfessorSimply put, the NRA\u0027s answer to gun violence, one greatest plagues facing America today, is more guns.Read Post | Comments (176)Arianna Huffington, 12/21/12This week\u0027s issue of Huffington largely focuses on the tragedy in Newtown, bringing together essays and moving photos to capture the horror and heartbreak of that day. Peter Goodman writes of the natural tendency, and the folly, of trying to make sense of such violence. And as we move forward as a country, the urge \"to grieve and hold our children close,\" as Lisa Belkin puts it, is not enough.Read Post | Comments (65)Bianca Bosker, 12/20/12Executive Tech Editor, The Huffington PostIf ever there was a sign that Facebook has completed its transition from social network to commercial network, this is it. Facebook is trying to turn a profit in a way that subverts the original purpose of the site. Paying for special delivery doesn\u0027t encourage socializing. It penalizes it.Read Post | Comments (120)Marian Wright Edelman, 12/21/12President, Children\u0027s Defense FundInstead of responding by saying no to the culture of violence, we are apparently responding by arming ourselves with more weapons. If that cycle of violence and fear is having such a deep psychological impact on adults, how do we expect our children to navigate or survive it?Read Post | CommentsMohamed A. El-Erian, 12/21/12CEO and co-CIO, PIMCOIn order to avoid a recession that would aggravate the country\u0027s unemployment problem and reignite concerns about housing and household finances, Democrats and Republicans need quickly to find a way to work together.Read Post | Comments (61)Alex Gibney, 12/21/12FilmmakerIt\u0027s difficult for one filmmaker to criticize another. That\u0027s a job best left to critics. However, in the case of Zero Dark Thirty, about the hunt for Osama bin Laden, an issue that is central to the film -- torture -- is so important that I feel I must say something.Read Post | Comments (79)Seth Shostak, 12/21/12Senior Astronomer, SETI InstituteBuying insurance is seldom gratifying. But here\u0027s a case in which plunking down cash for a policy is just ... good policy.Read Post | CommentsDan Treadway, 12/21/12Associate blog editor, The Huffington PostI just wish that LaPierre had been given more time to pass around more blame for gun violence in America. Given the opportunity to further expand on the true culprits, there\u0027s little doubt that the NRA would happily blame America\u0027s deadly epidemic on any number of things.Read Post | Comments (41)Dr. Lee Bowes, 12/20/12CEO, America Works of New York, Inc.Networking gives you the advantage in the job hunt. By using connections and networks, you differentiate your name from the thousands of other online applications. Employers are quick to rely on networks because they save time and they are more reliable than résumés.Read Post | CommentsGuy Branum, 12/21/12Writer and comedianSilver\u0027s refusal to fully participate in gay identity is the real problem. We must acknowledge the cultural forces that allow a person to participate in homosexual sex while feeling like the concerns, bigotries and culture that surround homosexuality do not apply to them.Read Post | Comments (29)Jim Sleeper, 12/21/12Lecturer in Political Science, Yale UniversityAbsent a better politics, it\u0027s hard to imagine what might change the climate at a lot of local TV news shows that play up every nasty crime, or among the producers of internet games. We have to make them realize that they\u0027re doing something to kids and to our society that, as parents, and citizens, they\u0027re already living to regret.Read Post | CommentsMeryl Davids Landau, 12/19/12Author of the spiritual women\u0027s novel, \u0027Downward Dog, Upward Fog\u0027When Dr. Terry Wahls found herself unable to walk or even sit up in a wheelchair, she became determined to improve. Having already seen the best doctors at the renowned Cleveland Clinic and taken the state-of-the-art drugs, she knew she had to do something radical.Read Post | Comments (95)Mario Livio, 12/21/12Astrophysicist, Space Telescope Science InstituteThere is no doubt that a huge asteroid impact on Earth would be devastating to many life forms. However, we often forget that asteroid impacts may have played a crucial role in the emergence of life on Earth, and possibly even in the fact that humans are here to talk about them!Read Post | CommentsDevon Corneal, 12/21/12Lawyer, MotherIn that moment, I realized I have a much longer list for Santa than I thought. I may not want presents under the tree and an overflowing stocking, but I want. I want a list of things a mile long. I just don\u0027t want things that can be wrapped.Read Post | CommentsCenk Uygur, 12/21/12Host, \u0027The Young Turks\u0027If ever there was a time to press progressive priorities this would be it. So, this will be a true test of who he is and what he believes. Let\u0027s see what he does. You shall know him by his works.Read Post | Comments (293)Jared Bernstein, 12/21/12Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThe House Republicans have failed to pass their benighted Plan B. But other than \"Republicans are in deep disarray\" what does that mean for near term fiscal policy -- should we prepare the trimmings for a Merry CLIFFmas?Read Post | Comments (146)Joel Rubin, 12/21/12Director of Policy and Government Affairs, Ploughshares FundJohn Kerry as secretary of state would help Obama lead -- as a powerful voice for America on the world stage, a visionary leader who understands how to deal with complex challenges and a staunch friend of close allies like Israel.Read Post | CommentsJacqueline Head, 12/21/12News editor, Huffington Post UKWhether it\u0027s old fashioned carols or chart topping hits, the jangly melodies and cheery tunes might as well be nails scraping on a blackboard. Jingle Bells? More like jingle hell.Read Post | Comments (12)David Israel, 12/21/12Writer; Producer; Former syndicated columnistThe only way forward, the only way out of this morass is to drive madly, insanely, way past the red line on the tachometer, right down the middle of highway. It\u0027s the only way forward on guns. It\u0027s the only way forward on the fiscal cliff nonsense. It\u0027s the only way forward, period.Read Post | CommentsPeter Davis, 12/21/12Academy Award-winning filmmaker, author and journalistAs I recently descended into sleep after a Messiah concert I thought of all the ways innocence is lost, the moral imperatives that attend these melancholy moments, mostly benign, once in a ghastly while inescapably horrific. Did it matter to anything in the universe?Read Post | CommentsJim Wallis, 12/21/12Christian leader for social changeToday, I challenge our political leaders to read the Christmas story of God come to earth and born in a manger as a child of working-class parents, and then reexamine their own budget priorities.Read Post | CommentsAbby Huntsman, 12/21/12Political Commentator and Host for HuffPost LiveAs a member of the millennial generation, I recognize the implications of today\u0027s policies on not only myself, but my kids and their kids\u0027 future. Isn\u0027t this all the more reason we should let our voices be heard once elections come to and end?Read Post | CommentsRalph Nader, 12/21/12Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorSpreading \"joy with toys\" is a major part of what the holidays in America have become -- selling directly to children, without respect to limits, boundaries or even common decency. While completely shielding a child from rampant commercialization isn\u0027t easy, there are still ways to protect the essential blessings of childhood.Read Post | Comments (32)Doug Bandow, 12/21/12Senior Fellow, the Cato InstituteMaybe Chuck Hagel isn\u0027t the right man to head the Defense Department. If so, it isn\u0027t because he is an anti-Semite. Let\u0027s have an honest and civil debate over his qualifications for the office. Israel loses when its American supporters resort to demagoguery allegedly on its behalf.Read Post | Comments (91)Owen Egerton, 12/21/12AuthorThe Mayans have been getting some great press lately. They\u0027ve cornered the market on apocalyptic predictions, at least for this week.
