Keegan, 06.03.2011President, People For the American WayRomney\u0027s changing positions are not just the tragicomic tale of a man so desperate for the presidency he\u0027ll say anything to get there: they\u0027re also a valuable measure of what it takes to make it in the modern GOP.Read Post | CommentsCynthia R.
