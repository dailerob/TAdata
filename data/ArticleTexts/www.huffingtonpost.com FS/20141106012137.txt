{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupMitch McConnell has done his share of bipartisan deals in the Senate, but almost always on his own terms and almost always after he helped create the crisis that he then takes credit for ending. Now he must keep the peace among potential Republican presidential candidates in the Senate, pacify the tea party wing while showing that the GOP is “ready to govern,” deal with the hapless Republican leadership in the House, and even reach out to President Barack Obama, who has reason to be wary. McConnell has the skill to bridge divides within the GOP in the Senate, and maybe in Congress as a whole. That will be his first challenge. Whether he can speak to the whole country and try to bring Americans together -- and whether he wants to -- will become clear in the months ahead.I\u0027m reminded of the old saw about being careful about what you ask for, because you might get it. If these far-right radicals are half as good at governing as they\u0027ve been at heckling from the sidelines, they\u0027ll be political superstars.Liberal political commentator, host of \"The Alan Colmes Show\" on Fox News Radio, publisher of alan.com, author of \"Thank the Liberals … For Saving America\"Nearly 80% of the country is not divided, but actually united on many issues.

You\u0027re surely detached enough to listen to me calmly. I\u0027ve met very few people who were able to listen to me. Maybe none. But you\u0027re here, with a fresh mind and a calm eye.EntrepreneurThe polling place I usually go to -- the local Sheriff\u0027s office just down the street -- was closed down this year. So I ventured out to the alternative this time, the local Grocery store, and stood in line. It was boring. It was maddeningly inefficient. It was cold (we extended the line down the frozen food aisle) and it was educational.Director, Education \u0026 Development for Constant Contact, Inc.This pro-polluter agenda is not what the majority of Americans want. Poll after poll shows strong support for environmental protection. Yet incoming Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner ignore these views.President, NRDCIn the lame duck and for the next two years, if Republicans behave as if the outcome of this election was a mandate for their radical policies, they will find themselves in deep trouble.Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersSciencey Sun Venerator + Political CartoonsWhile gaining control of Congress sounds good to the Republicans on paper, I suspect that 24 months from now, when the presidential election is upon us, they\u0027ll be regretting having taken the helm on foreign policy.CEO of Country Risk Solutions and COO of RiskSoukThe most enduring \"winners\" in the midterms may be the wealthy interests that bankrolled their candidates of choice and can now expect to have the ears of their chosen representatives. But importantly, it\u0027s not all bad news on the money in politics front.Executive Vice President for Policy and Program, People For the American Way \u0026 People For the American Way FoundationPresident Obama will have to decide. Will he now to lay out what the country needs, make his case, make the choices clear, and stand against those who would take the country back? Or will he provide cover for deals that stack the deck even more for the powerful and against the rest of us?President, Institute for America\u0027s FutureWe\u0027ve launched a dedicated section on The Huffington Post, ReWork: Rethinking Work and Well-being. Here you\u0027ll find success stories, news about what\u0027s working, innovative programs, case studies and the latest data about the many positive business effects of well-being and sustainable work practices.I don\u0027t have a multi-million dollar company (yet), but I\u0027m one of those CEOs who function on 3-5 hours of sleep. No, there aren\u0027t any drugs involved, nor is there poor management (as far as I know). It\u0027s a variety of things.The best answer to any questionWhen historians look back at the movement to end the war on drugs, they might very well point to the 2014 election as the moment when it all got real. With marijuana legalization measures passing in Oregon, Alaska and D.C., there\u0027s no longer any denying that drug policy reform is a mainstream -- and quite urgent -- political demand.Publications Manager, Drug Policy AllianceThe terrifying thing about last night is not that Republicans won a lot of individual races. The terrifying thing is that last night was a compete vindication of McConnell et al\u0027s strategic gamble. And so long as that strategy works, our elected officials won\u0027t actually bother to legislate or govern.Assistant professor of media and public affairs, George Washington UniversityAs we rely more and more on platforms like Facebook to maintain our friendships, and less and less on phone calls and actual get-togethers, we are only seeing a narrow view of our friends\u0027 lives.Blogger, Motherhood, WTF?A sea change in the composition of the Congress is always taken to have profound consequences for American foreign policy. Those expectations usually prove exaggerated. The broad consensus on the basic premises of the country\u0027s external relations is too strong to permit stark confrontations.Senior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghPolitical cartoonist syndicated by the NYTimes worldwideWithout a shred of evidence-based data they have been tirelessly promoting the idea that an armed America is a safer America for the last twenty years, but why let facts stand in the way of a good marketing campaign, right?Mike the Gun GuySo many conversations are initiated and shaped by women on Twitter. Important conversations about terms that used to fly right by me in their ideological camouflage: Rape culture. Misogyny. Privilege, gender bias, slut-shaming.Writer, comedian, and author, \u0027Funny On Purpose\u0027Having a medically fragile child is difficult, and you may feel alone, isolated, or invisible. But today, I want you to know that you are not alone, you are not invisible, and that I see you.Registered nurse (RN) with a strong passion for preemies, developmental care in the NICU, parent teaching, and educationIt was a great night for Republicans as they nearly swept all the important U.S. Senate races and won some governorships that seemed very unlikely.Professor, Author, Columnist, and Commentator at MichaelFauntroy.com.It must have been deeply confusing for thousands of people that during his most recent tour of the United States, a mysterious group of protesters has been hounding the Dalai Lama at every stop, from Alabama to Princeton to Boston to New York.Activist, Writer and MusicianIt\u0027s one thing to say that you think the president is doing a bad job confronting ISIS. It\u0027s quite another to be forced to say what exactly you would do differently.Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicyWhat Democrats failed to get in 2014 is that every election is now a national election, and the party with the stronger narrative -- the party on offense, not defense -- will win most of the competitive races.Co-Founder, Democracy PartnersThrough it all he never doubted his talent, even when some of the rockier parts of the business threatened to derail his career.
