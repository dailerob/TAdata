{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonLast Sunday delivered a swinging pendulum of emotions. On one extreme was Seattle\u0027s stirring Super Bowl trouncing of Denver. In addition to what I\u0027m told was good defense, it turns out that one of the Seahawks\u0027 not-so-secret weapons was yoga and meditation. Coach Pete Carroll had wondered what effect building an organization that \"really cared about each and every individual\" would have on his team\u0027s chances. Question answered. On the darker side of the ledger was Philip Seymour Hoffman\u0027s tragic death. He captured the public imagination both in life, where he found the full humanity of every character he played, and in his death, which crystallized the growing sense that something is very wrong in a culture rife with addiction. Indeed, from 1999 to 2012, drug overdoses skyrocketed 102 percent, and became the leading cause of injury or death. There\u0027s no easy fix, but connecting with the empathy to be found in Hoffman\u0027s on-screen legacy is a start.Comments (16)Gary HartUnited States Senator (Ret.)The age of communications, mass social media, ubiquitous technology, and of mass interception (and thus of Snowden) is a new world... and not an especially brave one.Comments (23)Robert RedfordActor, director and environmental activistYou\u0027ll remember that the president said he won\u0027t greenlight a project that raises the dangers of climate change. The State Department report makes it clear that this is exactly what Keystone XL would do. Bottom line: the tar sands pipeline fails the president\u0027s climate test.Comments (322)Jamie Lee CurtisActress and children\u0027s book authorToday is the fifteenth anniversary of my living clean and sober, free from the grips of a long, secret prescription painkiller and alcohol addiction. I went to sleep last night imagining the grief of the family, children, friends, colleagues and fans of Mr. Hoffman. His gifts, so powerful, his demons, more so.Comments (104)Arianna HuffingtonGeorgina Henry, a longtime editor at The Guardian, died today at her home in London, two years after being diagnosed with a brain tumor. Her life and legacy, as a journalist, editor and champion of opening up the conversation to voices that would otherwise go unheard, touched many of us in the media world.CommentsLeVar BurtonActor, Director, Co-founder of Reading RainbowMother Nature, the power of a nascent storytelling art form in the televised mini-series, and a nation largely ignorant of and reluctant to come to terms with the horrors of its slave-owning past conspired to create a \u0027perfect storm\u0027 of enlightenment in America.Comments (17)Trita ParsiPresident, National Iranian American CouncilThe defeat of AIPAC\u0027s ill-advised push for new sanctions on Iran in the midst of successful negotiations is nothing short of historic. The powerful and hawkish pro-Israeli lobby\u0027s defeats are rare and seldom public. But in the last year, it has suffered three major public setbacks, of which the sanctions defeat is the most important one.Comments (75)Dr. Jill BidenSecond Lady of the United StatesBecause of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs\u0027 Caregiver Rule, Brett\u0027s employer kept his job open so Brett had the time to care for his brother. Now Brett\u0027s back at his job in Chicago, and Kyle is doing great. Like the brothers\u0027 situation illustrates, these support systems can have a significant impact on the day-to-day hardships caregivers face.CommentsJeffrey SachsDirector, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \"To Move the World: JFK\u0027s Quest for Peace\"Herein lies the tragic, indeed fatal, flaw of the State Department review. The State Department Environmental Impact Statement doesn\u0027t even ask the right question: How do the unconventional Canadian oil sands fit or not fit within the overall carbon budget?Comments (413)Cecile RichardsPresident of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, \u0026 Planned Parenthood VotesIn the weeks and months to come, Planned Parenthood will continue to join our allies in urging members of Congress to put politics aside and work together to restore voter protection under the Voting Rights Amendment Act.Comments (37)Tavis SmileyPBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorThe Justice Department charged Snowden with three counts of violating the Espionage Act, which carries prison sentences of 10 years each. Professor Smith discusses how Snowden\u0027s acts may be regarded in the future.CommentsVictoria A. BrownworthPulitzer Prize-nominated journalist and the first out lesbian to have a column in a daily newspaperPoverty isn\u0027t a \"money problem.\" It\u0027s not about having to wait to cash out your 401k or your IRA or some of your stocks. It\u0027s having nowhere to turn for money. It\u0027s wondering which bill can be paid and which bill can be put off.Comments (111)Jon SoltzCo-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranIf Concerned Veterans for America wants to protect pensions, vets will be right there with them. But when the coda to that argument is the complete opposite -- \"And let\u0027s privatize your pension\" -- that\u0027s where you lose many troops who are depending on a stable retirement.Comments (49)Valerie JarrettSenior Advisor to the President and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsWoodson taught us that, \"those who have no record of what their forebears have accomplished lose the inspiration which comes from the teaching of biography and history.\"CommentsBill MoyersManaging Editor, Moyers \u0026 CompanyAfter President Barack Obama\u0027s annual State of the Union address, it\u0027s a reality check from someone who artfully uses television drama to report on the state of America from an entirely different perspective -- the bottom up.Comments (28)Cenk UygurHost, \u0027The Young Turks\u0027If MSNBC cared about not presenting liberals as sniveling cowards, they would never go through these debasing apologies one after another. But they don\u0027t care about that because the guy who runs the network doesn\u0027t give a damn about how progressives look, because he isn\u0027t one of them.Comments (268)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarThe next time you feel nervous or anxious, worked up about a big presentation or your husband\u0027s forgetfulness, instead of willing yourself to calm down, try telling yourself to get jazzed instead.CommentsHoward DeanFormer Governor of Vermont and DNC Chairman, Democracy for America FounderA proposed rule would make significant changes to the availability of antidepressants and antipsychotics. Implementing these changes will bring additional risk to an already vulnerable population.CommentsKathleen AnnFreelance writer from New EnglandI\u0027m not a \"Never Had.\" I know what it\u0027s like to pay bills on time and have a little left over. I remember vacations and pedicures and going out to dinner. As a \"Used-to-Have,\" I know exactly what Corporate America, lobbyists and politicians have taken away from me.Comments (1,650)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorIf the law is to be understood and obeyed, it must be public information. How can we follow the law if we don\u0027t know what it is? This is the astonishingly unfortunate reality for a large number of our nation\u0027s laws.Comments (28)Sen. Kirsten GillibrandU.S. Senator from New YorkIn far too many cases, unpaid leave means families must face the stark choice between a paycheck and caring for a loved one. This is not a choice any family should have to make.Comments (41)David WildTV Writer; Contributing Editor, Rolling Stone; Co-Author, \u0027Everybody\u0027s Brother\u0027I never met John Lennon. \"You would have loved him,\" Ringo told me once casually, and I had to laugh. The truth is I have loved John Lennon all of my life.Comments (80)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistAs the Winter Olympics approach, millions across the country are already setting their DVRs for their favorite televised events, from figure-skating and hockey, to the luge and the giant slalom. As always, I\u0027ll probably catch a little bit of everything -- but there\u0027s one event I\u0027ll be sure to watch from start to finish: the women\u0027s ski jump. You read that right. This year, for the first time in Olympic history, women will be permitted to compete in this event. So why have they been previously denied the opportunity? Because of...wait for it...their uteruses.CommentsDean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027Remember the story about how the aging of the baby boomers will bankrupt us because we will have too few workers to support the surge of retired baby boomers? Now we are supposed to be worried that we won\u0027t have any work for people to do because the robots will be there to do it faster and cheaper. Either of these stories could in principle be true, but they cannot both be true.Comments (95)Sec. Kathleen SebeliusSecretary of Health and Human ServicesWithout the opportunity to live a healthy life, there is no opportunity to live the American dream or participate fully in our communities. Without the security of health insurance, there is no economic security for middle-class families, and for so many other families working their way into the middle class.CommentsTom EngelhardtEditor, TomDispatch.comWhile we, the citizens of the U.S., remain in legal America, the U.S. national security state exists in \"post-legal America\" because no illegal act from warrantless surveillance to torture committed in its service will ever be prosecuted.CommentsTerry O\u0027NeillPresident, National Organization for WomenLaws that restrict or deny access to reproductive health care procedures are openly discriminatory against women. How many lawmakers do you know who have dreamed up restriction after restriction after restriction to block men\u0027s access to vasectomy?Comments (44)Tony PosnanskiBlogger, \u0027The Anti-Jared\u0027Sometimes doing the right thing does not make everyone happy -- just the people who need it the most.Comments (303)Emily MendellCo-founder of mothersofbrothers.comAt 45 you still don\u0027t ever understand it all, but there is an acceptance of how this whole life thing works. You are quicker to say I\u0027m sorry, slower to linger in spaces that feed you, and generally liberated from 80 percent of the shoulda-woulda-couldas that dominated your 30s.Comments (73)Fern Siegel, 2014. 9.02Suzanne Skees, 2014. 9.02Douglas J.
