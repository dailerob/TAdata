{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundWe must band together across all racial and income groups, and be clear that we cannot wait any longer to ensure our children’s healthy development and well-being. It is the right thing to do, it is the cost effective thing to do, and we can start right now by putting into place a comprehensive early childhood development system, including a continuum of care from birth through age five. Children have only one childhood, and it is now. We know what to do. We know what works. We must make it happen now by working together. Improving the Odds for America’s Children is a blueprint for action.I have been asked about Miley Cyrus a handful of times during my travels abroad. I am often asked if I know someone named \"John\" who also lives in New York City. But the only question I have been asked on every coast of every country I\u0027ve visited is: \"Why do Americans love guns so much?\"Joanna ZelmanFront page editor, The Huffington PostHe tweeted from the International Space Station. Now astronaut Chris Hadfield tells the amazing story of going blind in space. Then he covers David Bowie, just because.TEDTalks\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"The use of racial, ethnic and religious profiling by law enforcement is un-American and should end.

So, shouldn\u0027t it be obvious how to achieve that third value, happiness? Not in my experience.Hervé LarrenFounder, BidKindIf I ever get a job where I\u0027m paid a living wage, I will probably still volunteer at both the food pantry and thrift shop because the work they are doing really helps people, and nobody knows that better than I do.Stephanie S. BrooksNew Hampshire residentWe hope to use this toolkit to convince HR directors, caterers, hotel chains, event planners, and some of our gracious bosses that it\u0027s easy to put together a satisfying and delicious meal or snack that won\u0027t undermine the health of their employees and guests.Michael F. JacobsonExecutive Director, Center for Science in the Public InterestYou\u0027d think that that public television would support public education, but you\u0027d be wrong. The Public Broadcasting System (PBS) has gotten in bed with the billionaires and conservatives who want to privatize our public schools.Peter DreierE.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeThe Justice Department is considering revised racial profiling guidance that, if issued, could set back race relations and basic fairness in this country.

It was filibustered, which just goes to show that one party cares about women\u0027s rights and one party clearly does not.Chris WeigantPolitical writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comHere at Harvard, where students have big dreams and an abundance of resources, it can be difficult to allow ourselves the time to put away our devices and relax. In the spirit of Arianna\u0027s visit to campus, I interviewed Harvard students on how they \"thrive.\"Eva ShangEditor-at-Large, Harvard UniversityPaul Kagame has used his impressive achievements, (and the continuing guilt of the West) to mount a sophisticated International PR campaign to counter the accusations that he is a ruthless dictator.Terry GeorgeOscar winning filmmakerWhile much has been researched and written over the years about America\u0027s gender pay gap, I want to instead discuss how you can act if you learn that you are, in fact, being paid less than your male colleague at work.Kim KeatingFounder and managing director, Keating AdvisorsWhen a magazine calls a woman with pale eyes and hair beautiful, I don\u0027t have any problem agreeing. They are beautiful. We all are. But what many magazines fail to realize is that there\u0027s more than one brand of beauty.Camryn GarrettTeen writer from New YorkImmigration reform is not just an economic issue -- although it plays a big role in attracting and retaining talented people who will contribute to our economy. Commonsense immigration reform -- as Boston\u0027s Cardinal Sean O\u0027Malley affirmed -- is part of a consistent ethic in which all of life is treated as sacred.Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersI\u0027ve had the pleasure of watching, as a parent -- removed, but still very close -- the entrepreneurial spirit in action. And it\u0027s given me a much clearer view of what it takes to launch a business, and even what it means to be able to create something from nothing in that way.Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarBut I do have issues with being in a country of over 300 million people who are not all white, who don\u0027t all live in -- or near -- Manhattan, who are not all college educated, and who are not all males. But you never would know that if you\u0027re relied on the executives from NBC and CBS.Jamie MasadaOwner, The Laugh FactoryThe problem with the naysaying and finger pointing is not only that it is wrong, but the single-mind blaming of Israel for the breakdown of talks reinforces an atmosphere that makes moving forward toward any kind of peace or understanding more unlikely.Abraham H. FoxmanNational Director, Anti-Defamation LeagueMany people speak about keeping the anonymity of their children intact by leaving their names and photos out of articles they write, but with the technology available now, how much is that impeding the information being readily available to employers and college admissions officers?Jamie KrugWriter, SAHM, CMO - Chief Medical Officer (of my family), Wife, Blogger at Our Stroke of LuckLast week, as part of the reopening of the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis, I moderated three panels of civil rights advocates who reflected on early efforts to pass civil rights legislation, promises fulfilled and progress not yet made.Tavis SmileyPBS talk show host, PRI radio host, NYT bestselling authorFor the past two days, 22-year-old Mary McCoy has been mercilessly mocked and ridiculed by what feels like the entire internet -- and she says she\u0027s loving it.Dan LyonsMarketing fellow at HubSpot and creator of \u0027The Secret Diary of Steve Jobs\u0027NATO should be getting the message. Someone in Brussels should be ordering a big cake, compiling the festschrift, preparing golden parachutes for the top brass, and getting the \"mission accomplished\" banner printed up.John FefferCo-director, Foreign Policy In FocusWives still report doing about twice as much housework and childcare as their husbands. One difference is that today\u0027s couples, even if they unconsciously embrace traditional gender stereotypes and live less-than-egalitarian lives, may publicly proclaim more egalitarian values.Wray HerbertAuthor, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027If a network chose to place a woman behind the desk of a late night show, there would be an opportunity to do something both historic and radical -- suggest that the voice of a female comedian is as relevant as that of her male counterpart.Ann marie HoughtailingAuthor, founder, Millionaire Girls\u0027 MovementWe often mistake the artificial chemical and psychological thrill of fake edges for the real. In fact we often seek them out as a substitute for the reality of change, growth and exploration. Our minds and bodies help us in this, as they react much the same to this simulations as to the real world. Thus we scream in horror movies or amusement park rides and get a rush from blowing up the bad guys in video games.Rick TumlinsonFounder, Deep Space Industries, EarthLight Foundation, Space Frontier Foundation, Orbital Outfitters Inc.The world seems like it will never be equal for men and women because of how society perceives gender roles.
