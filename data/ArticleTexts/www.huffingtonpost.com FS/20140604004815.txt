{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Chairman, Generation Investment Management and The Climate Reality ProjectWe simply cannot continue to use the atmosphere as an open sewer for dirty and dangerous global warming pollution that endangers our health and makes storms, floods, mudslides and droughts much more dangerous and threatening -- not only in the future, but here and now. As with the connection between tobacco and lung cancer, special interests have vehemently denied the linkage between carbon emissions and the climate crisis. But the reality of global warming is now much more apparent and many more people are beginning to demand action. These same special interests now recognize that change is inevitable, but continue to trot out misleading and false claims to spread confusion and delay action for as long as they can. However, it is now clear that further inaction would be extremely dangerous and destructive for America and the rest of the world.If I started a business and it was clearly failing, I would shut it down. The war on drugs has failed -- why isn\u0027t it being shut down?Founder, Virgin GroupThe dangers from human-induced climate change are real and the climate science is sound. Deniers will probably shriek in the coming days, yet their scientific credibility is now nearly zero and sinking fast.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \"To Move the World: JFK\u0027s Quest for Peace\"Is work ethic always instilled -- by parents, in young children? Can it be learned later on or, in fact, even be inherent?Author, research psychologist and gender scholarThe largest prison education program in California is thriving at Ironwood State Prison, where men are transcribing college textbooks into Braille, learning trade skills and where an astonishing 1200 students have earned college degrees.Executive Producer of The Hangover film franchise, founder of The Anti-Recidivism Coalition (ARC)It is hard to fathom. Major elements of the once-proud Republican Party have stooped so low that they are systematically attacking an American prisoner of war because they believe it discredits their political adversaries.Political Organizer, Strategist, Author; Partner Democracy PartnersI\u0027m not an economist or a scientist. I can tell you how baking powder and baking soda react. I can warn you not to knead your dough too much. But the fact is, you don\u0027t have to be a scientist to understand that we\u0027re throwing too much bad stuff into the air to expect much good back.Cooking up Pastries and PoliticsIt\u0027s great to look for savings that still preserve the quality of the service provided by SSA. But a route that will make it difficult for beneficiaries to talk to a human being doesn\u0027t fit the bill.Co-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027How can I raise my boys into men who will never, ever touch someone when they are not wanted? What can I do to make sure that my sons will never be perpetrators? Which decisions can I make so that my boys will look for opportunities to stand as heroes to women, never as threats?Clinical Associate Professor, University of Pittsburgh School of MedicineA better source of financing for home purchases is urgently needed -- and there is one.Professor of Entrepreneurship (Ret.), Stern Business School/NYUAs time wears on, the following prediction will seem less like science fiction and more like science fact: The Republicans will eventually try to take credit for the Affordable Care Act. The fact that it\u0027s proving itself to be increasingly successful, along with the reality that much of the law was originally conceived by Republicans, makes it absolutely ripe for the plucking.Managing Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowWhy would a self-proclaimed \"patriot\" steal not just information needed to \"blow the whistle\" on a surveillance program -- but also steal a large trove of unrelated highly sensitive national security and military information?Former Minnesota Governor, CEO, Financial Services RoundtableOlder and worn out, the king who once apologized to his people, is now leaving office. By choice, yes, but also driven by the reality of a country that has long stopped considering him untouchable, a time when his crucial role in the transition of the country to democracy is diluted in memory and is not enough to ensure the unconditional support of the people.Editorial Director, El Huffington PostOne wonders what Atticus Finch would think of many in these open carry groups, as they brandish their long guns in a pack mentality, badgering any person who dares to stand up to their frightening display of misplaced priorities and caliber-heavy bravado.Political consultant/government relations, amateur Civil War historianAlthough the 1986 overdose death of 11-year-old Reynolds Allen Wintersmith Jr.\u0027s mother, unlike that of all-American basketball standout Len Bias that same year, did not thrust our nation\u0027s legislators into reactive political pandemonium, the federal drug-sentencing policies of that year would later impact this motherless son\u0027s life in a most damning and undeniable way.Criminal defense lawyer, public commentator, and constitutional law expertToday, anyone and everyone has the capacity to be a journalist and to record with their smartphones potential abuses of government authority.Professor and Brechner Eminent Scholar in Mass Communication, University of Florida in GainesvilleI invite all the lonely, angry, nerdy little boys out there who are feeling that rage and creating a narrative where they are victims to remember that. I was once one of you. And I was wrong. I was so, so wrong.Comedian, writer, and actor who lives in Brooklyn, NYBy releasing the five Guantánamo prisoners without prior congressional approval, President Obama has blown away the excuse that his hands are tied by Congress. Now he must deal with the remaining Guantánamo prisoners by freeing the 77 who have been cleared, and by freeing -- or securing fair trials for -- the rest.Co-founder, CODEPINK: Women for PeaceIf the war is ending, then we are about the business of bringing our soldiers home. If we are not about the business of bringing our soldiers home, then the war is not ending.Policy Director, Just Foreign PolicyThere are a lot of reasons why Americans don\u0027t know how the law affects them or why they believe things about Obamcare that aren\u0027t true. One of the biggest reasons is the failure of many in the media to provide anything other than the most superficial coverage.Author, consultant; columnist at Center for Public Integrity and healthinsurance.orgToday\u0027s hearing is a historic step forward to adopting the 28th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. That amendment will help restore the most basic understanding of democracy: that the people -- not the corporations, not the plutocrats -- rule.President, Public CitizenInspiration through photos is a function of interests, not your social connections.Designer, maker of things, husband, champion of users, product experience junkie, friend to startupsFor the first time, the United States will set a national limit on how much carbon pollution can be released from existing power plants. This is the single most important thing our nation can do right now to fight climate change.President, NRDCIn the sea of bad news the public receives every day, the Drug War has become one of the leading bright spots, with each day bringing yet another change, the first steps toward rolling back four decades of soul-crushing injustice.Award-winning filmmaker, public thinker, and authorOccasionally I run into people who want to argue that the increase in inequality is just the benign outcome of \"just desserts\" as economist Greg Mankiw frames it. It may boost those at the top, but not at the expense of others. By this metric, not so.Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThere is deep grief when a cultural touchstone such as Maya Angelou passes on, but her death is not an ending. It is an invitation for us to embody the possibility of love, peace, and inspiration within.Contemporary thought leader and spiritual teacherThe first kick is less than two weeks away and like World Cups in the past, it\u0027s already filled with intrigue. We shouldn\u0027t expect anything less. The only guarantee is anything is possible. There will be goals, there will be heartbreak, but only one winner.Freelance journalistUnfortunately, the new initiatives by the US government to ward off rising temperatures are weak at best. What\u0027s sorely missing from the climate change debate is a new economic vision that can quickly transition the US and global economy out of carbon based energy and into renewable energies.Author, \u0027The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of Things, the Collaborative Commons, and the Eclipse of Capitalism\u0027Whenever a person is able to refine and evolve the way they execute a movement, or an action, remarkable breakthroughs often happen in what is possible. When this occurs, people experience enhanced well-being and increased vitality.Founder, Anat Baniel MethodFounder, Anat Baniel MethodIn the end, this struggle over the meaning of one man\u0027s killing spree may prove to be a watershed moment in the history of feminism, which always has been and still is in a struggle to name and define, to speak and be heard.Author, \u0027A Paradise Built in Hell\u0027This is the first-ever World Cup for the imposing striker and for his country. This tournament\u0027s only debutant, Bosnia will be hoping for six-foot-four Dzeko to lead their line with the same authority that has seen him score better than a goal every two games in his previous 60-plus appearances for his country.The magazine the beautiful game deservesGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"HOLY HUBBLE!",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
