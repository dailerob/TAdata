{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Mark GongloffChief financial writer, The Huffington PostAmerica\u0027s biggest banks want you to believe that they get no special advantage, no subsidies, from being too big to fail. And yet people keep finding evidence of those subsidies. The latest is World Bank economist Deniz Anginer, in a study for Bloomberg Markets magazine. Anginer estimates that the six biggest U.S. banks have saved $82 billion in borrowing costs since 2009 because investors believe the government will never let them fail and thus don\u0027t charge as much to lend them money as they do smaller banks. Together with dirt-cheap government borrowing programs, Bloomberg estimates these banks -- JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley -- have saved $102 billion since 2009 because of their size advantage.Comments (609)Cameron RussellModel, director, editorWomen are often worried about how they look and that\u0027s not superficial. We know that our appearance has nothing to do with how smart, creative, or hardworking we are, but it plays powerfully into what society decides we are worth.Comments (143)Al GoreChairman, Generation Investment Management and The Climate Reality ProjectYesterday, for the first time in human history, concentrations of carbon dioxide, the primary global warming pollutant, hit 400 parts per million in our planet\u0027s atmosphere. Now, more than ever before, we are reaping the consequences of our recklessness.Comments (189)Bianca BoskerExecutive Tech Editor, The Huffington PostIn taking stock of Home\u0027s flop, most have ignored the fact that we already have Facebook phones: They\u0027re our iPhones. (Or really any other smartphone with a Facebook app)CommentsMarlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activistOur house was always ?lled with music -- from the moment we woke up. And whenever she threw a dinner party, you could be sure that at some point, Nat Cole or Sammy Cahn would be at the piano, accompanying Frank Sinatra or Sammy Davis or Sophie Tucker.CommentsArianna HuffingtonIn this week\u0027s issue, Saki Knafo looks at the plight of America\u0027s working poor through the eyes of one young man struggling to build a career in the fast food industry. And since this week marked the launch of our newest international edition in Japan, we\u0027re featuring photos from our tour of the gardens, temples and shrines of Kyoto.Comments (36)Allen FrancesProfessor Emeritus, Duke UniversityThe flat out rejection of DSM-5 by National Institute of Mental Health is a sad moment for mental health and an unsafe one for our patients. The APA and NIMH are both letting us down, failing to be safe custodians for the mental health needs of our country.Comments (25)Maureen RyanTV critic, The Huffington PostWe should find out today whether Community has been canceled. I hope it is. It gives me no pleasure to say that. But it\u0027s time for some real talk about holding on to things that should be allowed to die.Comments (24)Muhammad YunusNobel Peace Prize winner and founder of Grameen BankBoth the national and the international businesses should feel as though the workers are a part of their family. The days of slave labor have to come to an end. It is better to start the process now, before more ugly incidents occur.CommentsMarian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundThe \"Faces of Courage\" campaign is focused on honoring gun violence victims and their families -- and taking action so fewer mothers who are celebrating Mother\u0027s Day this weekend will be mourning their own children next year and in years to come.Comments (28)Mike RyanSenior Entertainment Writer, The Huffington PostI hate the last episode of Seinfeld. This is an admittedly odd way to open up an essay that is primarily about Friends. I also realize this isn\u0027t a particularly unique or notable sentence to write considering that most people who have seen the last episode of Seinfeld share this opinion.Comments (104)Donna HighfillWriter, Coach, Humorist, and Change ConsultantFad beauty can be everything from Rubenesque voluptuousness to elongated necks. It can include tattooed eyelids or lotus feet. What is overlooked is that fad beauty is often created by masochists who establish control over others by making them believe that they are never enough.Comments (20)Bill SchneiderDistinguished Senior Fellow and Resident Scholar at Third WayThe deficit is going down. Woo-hoo! Let the celebrations begin. Oh, wait. That may not be altogether a good thing. Certainly not for Republicans. They need an out-of-control deficit to bludgeon Democrats into cutting more spending.CommentsAnnise ParkerMayor of Houston, TXThough Kathy and I have been building a life together for 22 years, we cannot marry in our home state -- the state where I was born, and where I serve in Houston\u0027s highest office. Texas, like 40 other states, does not allow same-sex couples to marry.CommentsRalph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorThere\u0027s little to debate about the enormous impact our commercial culture has had on our planet. But there is much to debate about how our culture of excess consumerism and materialism can be transitioned into one of more efficient restraint and responsibility.CommentsArianna Huffington\"I have experienced failure as a politician,\" Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe once said. In his second round as the country\u0027s prime minister, he is determined to avoid the mistakes of the past -- beginning with how to deal with the stagnant Japanese economy.Comments (418)Mike HoganExecutive Arts and Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post Media Group\"You look around this room and ask, \u0027What binds the people in this room together?\u0027\" New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said at Casa Lever on Park Avenue Thursday night. \"It\u0027s that they\u0027re all creators, they\u0027re all doers.\"CommentsBob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowThe Benghazi attacks (the consulate and the CIA compound) are absolutely not unprecedented even though they\u0027re being treated that way by Republicans. So we\u0027re left to conclude the obvious. The investigations and accusations and conspiracy theories are entirely motivated by politics.Comments (3,864)Joan LundenAuthor, TV personalityAs both a caregiver to my 94-year-old mom, Gladyce, and a mother of seven, Mother\u0027s Day is a holiday that I cherish with my family. It\u0027s a time to reflect on the lessons we\u0027ve learned from mom, and the way those teachings have shaped who we are and how we instill values in our own families.CommentsJim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027We would take the time to sound out each syllable, word, and sentence until they got it right, \"With malice toward none, with charity for all ...\" While they were learning to read, I wanted them to absorb the words of Lincoln.Comments (86)Jonathan KimFilm Critic for ReThink Reviews and the Uprising ShowWith a cast of largely baby-faced actors, Jay-Z as an executive producer, and a soundtrack weighted towards hip hop and electronic music, is The Great Gatsby more for younger fans of Luhrmann\u0027s boisterous previous films like Moulin Rouge! and Romeo Juliet?Comments (13)Lester \u0026 CharliePolitical satiristsIt seems that South Carolina voters are all too ready to forgive the \"family values conservative\" who misused public funds, secretly left the country and lied to his entire staff about his whereabouts and deceived his wife about his sexual affairs with his South American mistress.CommentsDavid BerriCo-author, \u0027Stumbling on Wins\u0027; Economics professor, Southern Utah UniversityHow would we do something similar for a Wall Street executive? One might look at how a company performed with and without the executive. But how would you know if the changes you observed were about the executive or someone else in the company (or just luck)?CommentsDavid Katz, M.D.Director, Yale Prevention Research CenterMy onetime patient and student, Nicole Larizza, earned her MS degree in nutrition studying the effects of nutrition in childhood on breast cancer risk in adulthood. I found the information Nicole shared with me important and provocative -- and felt it deserved to be shared.Comments (18)Robert F. Kennedy Jr.President, Waterkeeper Alliance; Senior Attorney, NRDCWith cash gushers of oily money cascading down their open gullets, the Republican leadership\u0027s mercenary devotion to Big Oil shouldn\u0027t shock us. However, the boldness of the party\u0027s most recent assault on the public interest might cause us to ponder how GOP\u0027s honchos\u0027 knee jerk slavishness to petroleum interest has infected its rank and file.Comments (280)Gayle Tzemach LemmonAuthor, \u0027The Dressmaker of Khair Khana\u0027; Council on Foreign RelationsWhen people in the world of \"haves\" I now inhabit tell me that things are impossible or too hard to achieve, I think back immediately to the women I grew up with, single moms counted out by so many. And I am inspired by and grateful for their example.CommentsEric BoehlertSenior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaBenghazi serves as an all-purpose platform that allows the most hardened critics to project their anti-Obama madness.What kind of American is Obama if he won\u0027t protect citizens under attack?Comments (47)Vivian Diller, Ph.D.Psychologist and author, \u0027Face It\u0027Like Russell, I am one of those who benefited from the genetic lottery; first as a professional dancer and then as a Wilhelmina model. For both, I relied on the fortune of good genes. Like Russell, I felt ambivalent about \"cashing out\" on being \"a pretty white girl,\" but it\u0027s what I did.CommentsDerek ShearerProfessor of Diplomacy at Occidental College and former US ambassadorIt\u0027s important for Obama to try to move the political debate in a more progressive direction. In this way, even when he can\u0027t pass legislation he can tee up issues for action in the Clinton administration that might follow.Comments (135)Kim Turner and Colleen TurnerFrom grandmother to mother to daughter, the women in our family experienced firsthand the many gifts of sports, but also the academic and professional advantages. Sports gave us a sense of ourselves, our power, and the willingness to dig deep to turn challenging situations around.CommentsMotherWomanSupporting and Empowering MothersI did not feel like a normal mother. I was happy with Liam but I was incredibly lonely. I could share that there had been a baby before Liam, but not in any mother\u0027s group or playtime was there the space for me to truly tell my story.CommentsKaren Horneffer-Ginter, Ph.D., 2013.10.05Dr. Laurie Marker, 2013.10.05Chris Weigant, 2013.10.05Michelle Noehren, 2013.10.05Christopher Helfrich, 2013.10.05Jessica Ashley, 2013.10.05Frank A.
