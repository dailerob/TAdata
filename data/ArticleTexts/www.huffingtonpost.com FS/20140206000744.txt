{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, Beyond OutrageThe president and other Democrats -- and even Republicans, for that matter -- should focus on the facts, not the polls, and not try to dress up what\u0027s been happening with more soothing words and phrases. In fact, America\u0027s savage inequality is the main reason equal opportunity is fading and poverty is growing. Since the \"recovery\" began, 95 percent of the gains have gone to the top 1 percent, and median incomes have dropped. This is a continuation of the trend we\u0027ve seen for decades. Obama was correct in December when he called widening inequality \"the defining challenge of our time.\" He mustn\u0027t back down now even if Democratic pollsters tell him to. If we\u0027re ever to reverse this noxious trend, Americans have to hear the truth.Comments (97)Paula BrayLives in Kalama, WAThis is America today. We have no running water; we use a hose to fill jugs. At night, in my bed, when it\u0027s cold out, my blanket can freeze to the wall of the RV. I have a Master\u0027s degree and have been in the workforce for over 30 years. By the end of this month, we will be without anywhere to turn.Comments (501)Alon Ben-MeirSenior Fellow, NYU\u0027s Center for Global AffairsTime is running out and every day we continue to embrace the illusion of a political solution. Without first changing the balance of forces on the ground, scores of Syrian men, women and children will die and millions of Syrian refugees will have no home to return to.CommentsVictoria A. BrownworthPulitzer Prize-nominated journalist and the first out lesbian to have a column in a daily newspaperPoverty isn\u0027t a \"money problem.\" It\u0027s not about having to wait to cash out your 401k or your IRA or some of your stocks. It\u0027s having nowhere to turn for money. It\u0027s wondering which bill can be paid and which bill can be put off.Comments (23)Sharda SekaranManaging Director of Communications, Drug Policy AllianceToo often, the people who use drugs are invisible or worse they are stigmatized and demonized as \"junkies,\" \"addicts,\" and \"criminals.\" Drug users are \"others\" to be held in stark contrast to the rest of \"us.\"CommentsHerb SilvermanMany atheists, myself included, have been overly optimistic that a rational argument will be sufficient to change minds. I now think the best we can do is make good points in a reasonable and pleasant manner.Comments (21)Kathleen ReardonProfessor, USC Marshall School; Author, \u0027The Secret Handshake\u0027 and \u0027Shadow Campus\u0027Onset of serious mental illness in late teens and early twenties is very common and often shocking to the families that experience it. The medical community knows this; researchers know this; millions of families know this and yet we wait for the topic to find its time while millions try to cope. Surely we can do better.Comments (13)Richard (RJ) EskowSenior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s Future; Host, Take Action NewsWhat better way to start a much-needed transformation of our financial sector than by providing services to those communities the financial industry refers to as the \"unbanked\"?Comments (18)Valerie JarrettSenior Advisor to the President and Chair of the White House Council on Women and GirlsWoodson taught us that, \"those who have no record of what their forebears have accomplished lose the inspiration which comes from the teaching of biography and history.\"CommentsOlivia ColePoet, author, and activistWhile Trayvon Martin is in his grave, George Zimmerman will be smiling for the camera. My greatest wish is that he will find himself there alone: the cameras unmanned, the opposing corner empty, the audience nonexistent.Comments (89)Christian PiattAuthor, editor, speakerWhenever I hear about someone else making a case for New Earth Creationism in the name of Christianity, I\u0027m embarrassed, once again, to associate myself with them. The media is responsible for its share of fanning these flames in the public forum, though.CommentsDr. Jill BidenSecond Lady of the United StatesBecause of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs\u0027 Caregiver Rule, Brett\u0027s employer kept his job open so Brett had the time to care for his brother. Now Brett\u0027s back at his job in Chicago, and Kyle is doing great. Like the brothers\u0027 situation illustrates, these support systems can have a significant impact on the day-to-day hardships caregivers face.CommentsSen. Kirsten GillibrandU.S. Senator from New YorkIn far too many cases, unpaid leave means families must face the stark choice between a paycheck and caring for a loved one. This is not a choice any family should have to make.CommentsShannon WhiteheadSustainable apparel consultant; Columnist for Ethical Fashion Forum; Co-founder of {r}evolution apparelWhile the slow food movement is starting to catch on and consumers are becoming increasingly more conscious of what they eat, we don\u0027t yet think of clothing in the same way.CommentsOtto ScharmerSenior Lecturer, MIT; Founding chair, Presencing InstituteWhy is it that, across so many major systems, we collectively create results that nobody wants? Nobody wants to increase environmental destruction, poverty, cultural ADHD, or suicide. Yet we keep doing it. Why do we collectively recreate these patterns?CommentsAlexis KleinmanThis might hurt your feelings, but I\u0027m just going to come out and say it: I don\u0027t care about your Facebook history.Comments (60)Seth ShostakSenior Astronomer, SETI InstituteFaith is a personal matter, and should never be a cudgel to stifle inquiry. We tried that approach about 1,200 years ago. The experiment was called the Dark Ages.CommentsJon SoltzCo-Founder of VoteVets.org, Iraq War VeteranCoffman said: \"Certainly an advisory role, but certainly not anything beyond that. And that\u0027s if requested. I think we have to be very careful once out about reentering that particular conflict. I would say, in terms of regular troops on the ground, absolutely not.\" There are three points why, despite his moderate wording, Coffman is calling for yet another war.CommentsJillian BermanAssociate Business Editor, The Huffington PostThe bottom line is: Women earn less than men any way you look at it and that gap is far from a choice or \"subtle difference.\"Comments (80)Philip K. HowardAuthor, \u0027The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America\u0027America\u0027s special ed system is not just unwise, or inefficient, or absurdist. It is immoral. It is immoral not in its broad goals, but in its implementation.CommentsBob CescaManaging Editor for The Daily Banter, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowConsidering how Bill O\u0027Reilly merely pandered to the delusional obsessions of his viewers rather than using his time to ask questions of actual substance, I thought I\u0027d suggest some additional questions O\u0027Reilly could\u0027ve asked the president -- I mean, as long as he\u0027s asking stupid questions anyway.Comments (200)Ben IrwinAuthor, bloggerI know which of these two men I want my daughter to emulate -- if not with regard to faith, then with regard to intellectual inquiry. One of these two men was there to nurture curiosity. The other was there to stifle it.Comments (69)David L. PhillipsDirector of the Program on Peace-building and Rights at Columbia University’s Institute for the Study of Human Rights.Sudan and South Sudan are a revolving door of deadly conflicts. Comprehensive and sustainable peace can only be achieved through parallel steps affecting conditions in both countries. Managing crisis in one while neglecting the other is a stop-gap.CommentsSusannah LewisFreelance writer, blogger, aspiring best-selling author, wife, momI can only hope that the unconditional love that I possess for my precious offspring will keep them on the right path and make up for my countless mistakes.CommentsAri EmanuelCEO, William Morris Endeavor EntertainmentI\u0027m not saying that I\u0027ve struck the perfect balance, but I do believe that it\u0027s important to strive for your own version of it. Like anything worthwhile, it takes discipline and practice, but defining your life beyond career success is actually good for business.CommentsPaul RaeburnAuthor, \u0027Do Fathers Matter? What Science Is Telling Us About the Parent We\u0027ve Overlooked.\u0027Are we all walking the same razor\u0027s edge, only one injection away from heroin addiction? Or could some of us sample heroin and decide to pass it up as easily as we might pass up a second piece of pie? Can addicts ever really be cured? What is the reporting telling us?CommentsEric BoehlertSenior Fellow, Media Matters for AmericaKeep in mind Clinton isn\u0027t even a candidate yet. And the general election won\u0027t be held for more than 1,000 days. But that hasn\u0027t stopped the Beltway press from obsessing over her on a daily basis and routinely detailing all the things wrong with Clinton\u0027s would-be run.CommentsRev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkLet us quit playing ourselves: employers are not fighting this struggle so that they can hire more people. They want to maximize profits, bottom line.Comments (159)Howard DeanFormer Governor of Vermont and DNC Chairman, Democracy for America FounderA proposed rule would make significant changes to the availability of antidepressants and antipsychotics. Implementing these changes will bring additional risk to an already vulnerable population.CommentsJamie Lee CurtisActress and children\u0027s book authorToday is the fifteenth anniversary of my living clean and sober, free from the grips of a long, secret prescription painkiller and alcohol addiction. I went to sleep last night imagining the grief of the family, children, friends, colleagues and fans of Mr. Hoffman. His gifts, so powerful, his demons, more so.Comments (93)Daniel Wagner and Linda WetzelWhile Mr. Putin may rightly bask in the light of his many accomplishments in foreign policy, and having presided over the energy boom that thrived during much of his first term in office, he is now faced with some serious issues that cast a pall over Sochi.CommentsDiane Dimond, 2014. 5.02Vanessa Van Edwards, 2014. 5.02Diana Liverman, 2014. 5.02Maria Rodgers O’Rourke, 2014. 5.02Carol Pierson Holding, 2014. 5.02Elaine Weiss, 2014. 5.02Courtney McKinney, 2014. 5.02Liz Wainger, 2014. 5.02Ben Michaelis, Ph.D., 2014. 5.02Lisa Guisbond, 2014. 5.02Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"RUSSIAN VILLAGE LEFT IN SHAMBLES",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
