{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Joseph A. PalermoProfessor, historian, authorJohn F. Kennedy once said he wanted to \"splinter the CIA into a thousand pieces and scatter it into the winds.\" He reached that conclusion after CIA officials, including Director Allen Dulles, had misled him on many of the planning details of the disastrous April 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion. With the revelations that the CIA has been aggressively obstructing the work of the Senate Intelligence Committee, even to the point of spying on Senate staff conducting a long overdo review of its \"detention and interrogation\" program, we see the CIA has not changed its ways.CommentsArianna HuffingtonWhy have we made exercising -- at least the way we do it in the places that have come to be known as \"health clubs\" -- such an awful experience?Comments (22)Diane RavitchResearch Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027What is missing from the controversy so far is any interest on the part of the journalists in basic facts. Instead, what is happening is a PR battle. Eva Moskowitz has attacked Mayor de Blasio in multiple media appearances, and no one in the media has bothered to check any of her claims. Let\u0027s fill that gap.Comments (69)Adam GrantWharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027Saying no frees you up to say yes when it matters most. But the rest of the time, how do you say no without burning bridges and jeopardizing your reputation?CommentsSusan RosenzweigAdvertising creative director and personal essay writer.There are lots of reasons us singles are \"still\" single -- ranging from \"because I want to be\" to \"I\u0027m a raving sociopath.\" But after a tremendous amount of thought, I have come to the conclusion that for most of us somewhere in the middle, the explanations are pure BS.Comments (80)K. Ford K.Author, \u0027The Wife of John the Baptist\u0027I began to feel I had slipped so low that I was no longer respected. I lost self confidence. I stopped talking about my writing. Soon nobody knew that I was a writer or that I\u0027d ever gone to college. Nobody knew me. I became invisible.Comments (121)Noah MichelsonExecutive Editor, HuffPost Gay VoicesIn honor of my dad, Robert Michelson, one of the most incredible men who ever spent a little time on this planet -- and in honor of the pain and grief and wonder conjured by death -- I am sharing five things that I learned while helping him die.Comments (152)Jeffrey SachsDirector, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \"To Move the World: JFK\u0027s Quest for Peace\"There is no doubt that Russian militarized bullying can lead to the de facto division of Ukraine, an event that would be of grave long-term consequences not only for Russia and Ukraine but for the world. The practical question is whether international law can still function to stop this from occurring. In my view, the answer is yes.Comments (22)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesThis year at CPAC there was no panel focused on the evils of gay marriage. NOM did have a small table in the basement of the hotel with the other exhibitors, though nothing as grand as the massive, expensive booths and tents of the gun-rights groups or the anti-tax activists.Comments (77)Robert ScheerEditor, Truthdig.com; Author, \u0027The Great American Stickup\u0027It was a truly historic moment on Tuesday when Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Dianne Feinstein took to the Senate floor to warn that the CIA\u0027s continuing cover-up of its torture program is threatening our Constitutional division of power.Comments (19)Bonnie St. JohnOlympic Ski Medalist, Amputee, Rhodes Scholar, former White House Official, Corporate Leadership Expert, and Best-Selling AuthorIn a world of endless chores and challenges, your absolute best work should be targeted on the most significant and important elements of your life... not on every little thing competing for your energy.CommentsRobert L. BorosagePresident, Institute for America\u0027s FutureAmid the numbers, budgets display our values, what we consider important, what we consider fair, how we address our future. Taken together, the blizzard of numbers provides a pointillist portrait of the society we would build.CommentsSean McElweeWriterAlthough the U.S. is one of the richest societies in history, it still lags behind other developed nations in many important indicators of human development -- key factors like how we educate our children, how we treat our prisoners, how we take care of the sick and more.Comments (20)Chris WeigantPolitical writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.comAmericans are now being tracked as they\u0027ve never been tracked before. What is normal and accepted these days sounds like a tinfoil-hatted paranoiac\u0027s delusion from just a few decades ago, in fact.CommentsCynthia Germanotta and Marc Brackett, Ph.D.First and foremost, we are an organization that conducts our charitable activity directly, and we fund our own work. We are not a grant-maker that funds the work of other charities, and were never intended to be.CommentsLord Weidenfeld of ChelseaFounder and chairman of Weidenfeld \u0026 NicolsonMuch as his rhetoric and his will power in domestic policy is being recognized, he is generally been seen as lacking the talent to positively distinguish and assert himself in foreign policy.CommentsBernard-Henri LévyFrench philosopher and writerOn the subject of the Ukrainian crisis and the possible kidnapping of Crimea by the Russian Federation, we have been hearing two very strange arguments that are in urgent need of rebuttal.CommentsRev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkNo longer can we ignore the reality that our children are dying. No longer can we close our eyes to the immense pain and suffering of these grieving parents, siblings and loved ones. No longer can we act as if this doesn\u0027t impact us.Comments (28)Jamie KrugWriter, SAHM, CMO - Chief Medical Officer (of my family), Wife, Blogger at OurStrokeOfLuck.netI should have been happy, sweetly satisfied that day, at that moment. It should have felt like a celebration -- something to look forward to. If only I could stop myself from looking back, from feeling those feelings from that exact day four years earlier washing over me at random intervals.CommentsSen. Barbara BoxerU.S. Senator from California; Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works CommitteeIt was fascinating to listen to my Senate colleagues from across the country as they discussed what people in their states are experiencing now and the threats they face from climate change -- including extreme weather. Climate change is real, and it is happening all around us -- from coast to coast.CommentsDean BakerCo-director, CEPR; author, \u0027The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive\u0027During his tenure as mayor, Daley consistently failed to make the required contribution to the city\u0027s pension funds. As a result, according to his successor Rahm Emanuel, the city is on the brink of bankruptcy.CommentsJohn TirmanExecutive Director, MIT Center for International StudiesIn the U.S., longstanding perceptions of Iran as a devious and hostile force have led large numbers of senators and representatives to sign onto resolutions meant to constrain if not undermine the nuclear negotiations. But it\u0027s not a set of perceptions that is rooted in any reasonable calculation of threats.CommentsMike LuxCo-Founder, Democracy PartnersListening to conservatives at the CPAC conference last week is a remarkable experience. It might make you laugh, it might make you cry, or most likely both. It will probably give you a headache and raise your blood pressure if you listen too long, so do be careful.CommentsEllie KrupnickSenior Editor of Viral Content and Strategy, The Huffington PostSuddenly, like revelation at Sinai, Shabbat started to make perfect sense. Those 25 hours became a respite from my mounting schoolwork, a forced hiatus from the endless black hole of the Internet, the only time I could turn off a screen long enough to, say, play a game with my family.CommentsBrian RossManaging Editor, Truth-2-Power.com and pioneering ezine editor of the first sports ezine, MLNSportsTuesday\u0027s election was no referendum on national politics. It was, however, another searing indictment of the Florida Democratic Party.Comments (20)Michael WinshipSenior writer, Moyers \u0026 Company on public TV. Senior writing fellow, Demos. President, Writers Guild of America, East.\"All of this stuff was classified. Not just classified; it was classified at the highest level. These were the secrets that the government said were most critical to keep. But what kind of democracy would we be if the public had never learned of this information?\"CommentsNorman SolomonAuthor, \u0027War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death\u0027Soon we might see headlines asking: \"Is Dianne Feinstein a whistleblower or a traitor?\" It may already be a fact that Feinstein\u0027s speech yesterday blew a whistle on CIA surveillance of the Senate intelligence committee, which she chairs. But if that makes her a whistleblower, then Colonel Sanders is a vegetarian evangelist.CommentsAmbassador Uri SavirIsraeli diplomat and politicianObama and Kerry deserve much credit as they adhere to peaceful diplomacy. It is less popular than pretending to be the sheriff of the world, with useless pistols and tanks. In this era, opting for the moral high-ground is also the right choice for influence and growth.CommentsPhilip K. HowardAuthor, \u0027The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America\u0027America shouldn\u0027t fear action. It should fear a political culture designed to divert attention away from practical realities. The solution is a clean break: New leaders who do not get overwhelmed by cynicism, emboldened by a popular movement to fix this broken system, top to bottom.CommentsDan LyonsMarketing fellow at HubSpot and creator of \u0027The Secret Diary of Steve Jobs\u0027At first glance it seems shocking that there could be a profession in which three-quarters of practitioners are inept. But the numbers make sense when you consider that most people who go into sales have no formal training about how to sell.CommentsMario LivioAstrophysicist, Space Telescope Science InstituteThis winter, the continental U.S. has experienced such long periods of cold weather that some have started to wonder whether scientists have somehow gotten the signs wrong, and instead of global warming we are experiencing a mini ice age.CommentsMarty Zwilling, 2014.12.03Chris Weigant, 2014.12.03Edward Flattau, 2014.12.03Nicole Breedlove, 2014.12.03Liquor.com, 2014.12.03Byron Williams, 2014.12.03Cynthia Germanotta, 2014.12.03Diana Nyad, 2014.12.03Michael Drew, 2014.12.03Aisling Carroll, 2014.12.03Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"CRIMEA CLASH",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
