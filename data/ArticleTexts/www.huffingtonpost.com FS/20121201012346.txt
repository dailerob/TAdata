{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Institute for America\u0027s FuturePressure for a deal to avoid the so-called \"fiscal cliff\" at the end of the year is building. Even minor tremors in the stock market are treated as auguries of the panic that will attend a failure to act. The president has put forth a comprehensive $4 trillion-dollar plan, including ending the Bush tax breaks for the top 2 percent, $400 billion in savings from Medicare and Medicaid over 10 years, as well as extension of the payroll tax cut, and creation of an infrastructure bank to help sustain the economy. House Speaker John Boehner scorns this, arguing that the price of defusing the austerity bomb is a deal that combines far more significant cuts in \"entitlements\" with smaller amounts of revenue coming from lowering top rates and closing loopholes. Easily lost in the tumult is simple common sense. No deal is a far better alternative than a bad deal -- and the grand bargain now being discussed is a very bad deal.Read Post | Comments (125)Julian Assange, 11/29/12Editor-in-Chief and Founder, WikiLeaksThe information WikiLeaks has disclosed frustrates the controlled political discourse that is trumpeted by establishment media and Western governments to shape public perception.
