{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Jared BernsteinFmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThis deceleration in job growth and deterioration in labor force participation looks a lot like what you\u0027d expect if you hit a still weak recovery with the repeal of the 2 percent payroll tax break and the sequester (which is probably only a minor factor in these numbers, but will grow as the year progresses). There\u0027s a lot of moving parts in our economy, and the signal-to-noise ratio is never as high as you\u0027d like in these monthly reports. But this looks to me like a confirmation of the basic truth that policy matters, especially at a time like this. And from the perspective of a labor market that has yet to reliably show consistent signs of solid gains, we\u0027re simply not making the right policy choices.Comments (300)Ben GoldacrePhysician, authorDoctors need the results of clinical trials to make informed choices, with their patients, about which treatment to use. But the best currently available evidence estimates that half of all clinical trials, for the treatments we use today, have never been published.Comments (283)Jim WallisChristian leader for social change; Author, \u0027On God’s Side: What Religion Forgets and Politics Hasn’t Learned About Serving the Common Good\u0027We would take the time to sound out each syllable, word, and sentence until they got it right, \"With malice toward none, with charity for all ...\" While they were learning to read, I wanted them to absorb the words of Lincoln.Comments (15)Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundDespite the loud voice of the National Rifle Association (NRA), scholars, experts on school safety, and teachers overwhelmingly disagree with turning schools into armed camps rather than places of nonviolent positive learning.Comments (44)Arianna HuffingtonThis week, several of our reporters consider the past, present and future of gun control measures in the wake of December\u0027s mass shooting in Newtown. Sam Stein takes us back to the political fallout of the 1994 assault weapons ban, Howard Fineman interviews NRA president David Keene, and Christina Wilkie spotlights a non-profit that has backed a flurry of lawsuits designed to expand gun rights.Comments (45)Dylan RatiganNew York Times Best-Selling author and formerly the host of MSNBC\u0027s The Dylan Ratigan ShowAn awakening is happening in America, and it is as simple as creating jobs that solve our actual needs and, in the process, restore the very fabric of our own bodies and our relationship with the very planet we inhabit.Comments (26)Wray HerbertAuthor, \u0027On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind\u0027s Hard-Wired Habits\u0027It\u0027s the result of a fundamental misunderstanding of placebo effects and control groups -- a misunderstanding that, scientists are now arguing, invalidates any claims of effectiveness for almost all psychological interventions.Comments (21)Devon CornealLawyer, MotherYou know what makes our ideas and opinions less important? Pretending that we are so fragile that we can\u0027t handle a healthy and robust debate.Comments (55)Ralph NaderConsumer advocate, lawyer and authorDespite negative public sentiment and the rise of the Occupy movement, the avarice on Wall Street arrogantly continues on. The big banks are now even bigger and more powerful than they were in 2008 when they were bailed out by the U.S. taxpayers.Comments (23)Leonard MaltinFilm critic and historianThe role of critics has been marginalized by the growth of the Internet and the empowerment of self-made bloggers who are eager to share their opinions. But few, if any, of these wannabes will ever surpass Roger Ebert.Comments (40)Hollee Actman BeckerWriter and author of the blog suburbabble.comIt\u0027s time for us to take our collective blinders off and really pay attention. Because the minute we give our kids an iPhone or iPod or any other gadget that puts technology quite literally in the palms of their hands, we become responsible for whatever happens next.Comments (340)John WendelWriterSince the recent release of my wife Susan Spencer-Wendel\u0027s memoir, Until I Say Good-Bye, people often say to me, \"Your wife is such an inspiration.\" Or: \"This woman changed my outlook on life.\"CommentsRep. Diana DeGetteChief Deputy WhipThe gun lobby will take every opportunity to intimidate, and to attempt to silence, anyone with the courage of conviction to stand up and fight to keep our families safe.Comments (438)Kellee KhalilFounder and CEO, Lover.lyAs April showers roll in, you don\u0027t need to worry that the rain will ruin your wedding day (or your wedding photos). As these couples prove, a rainy wedding day can actually set the scene for gorgeous, romantic photos.CommentsGov. Martin O\u0027MalleyGovernor of MarylandThe children that were lost in Newtown were our children. The children that are lost to gun violence in neighborhoods throughout America are our children. And the lives that we can save tomorrow are our children\u0027s lives.Comments (502)Gloria GaynorSingerThe \"Queen is dead,\" was the report rumored to be circulating around my record company. Three months of physical therapy fraught with uncertainty about my career and ability to become financially stable again, ended with me approaching despair.Comments (12)Michelangelo SignorileEditor-at-large, HuffPost Gay VoicesThe sappy media stories paint the Salmons as a loving family where even \"differences\" over gay marriage can\u0027t come between them. But if you\u0027re working against rights for your own child in the name of your religious faith, then you love yourself and your beliefs more than you love your kid.Comments (232)Robert SchraderWriter, photographer and editor of LeaveYourDailyHell.comThe dissonance between the \"traveler\" archetype the public craves and the one we travelers actually embody is a result of today\u0027s traveler being fundamentally different than it has been at any point in even recent history.CommentsMarcelle Pick, OB-GYN N.P.Co-founder, Women to WomenAccording to a recent study, 60 to 80 percent of visits to primary care doctors may be related to stress, yet only 3 percent of patients receive stress management counseling. Why is it that so few people are getting help from their health care practitioners when it comes to stress?CommentsToni MillerAuthor, speaker and independent researcherAs the body of published literature fails to paint the entire picture, eventually the gap between reality and what we think is reality widens. The negative results are still pertinent for several reasons.CommentsRaymond J. LearsyAuthor, \u0027Oil and Finance: The Epic Corruption Continues\u0027Along with this new focus and responsibility, it is also high time that the nation establishes a Strategic Grain Reserve much in keeping with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.Comments (18)Marlo ThomasAward-winning actress, author and activist\"Stories can conquer fear,\" Nigerian novelist Ben Okri once said. \"They can make the heart bigger.\" There\u0027s a world of truth to that statement. As someone who comes from a long line of storytellers, I\u0027ve always said that our lives are just long and rich stories, knit together over the years, that tell us not only about ourselves, but the human condition, as well.Comments (26)Mike RyanSenior Entertainment Writer, The Huffington PostNo one has successfully launched a film-review television series since Siskel \u0026 Ebert. I think that\u0027s because all who have tried have made the audience feel stupid in one of two ways -- either by being too knowledgable, in a way that\u0027s alienating, or by being not knowledgable enough, in a way that makes you think, Why am I watching this?Comments (95)Annette InsdorfDirector of undergraduate film studies, Columbia University, and author of PHILIP KAUFMANHe knew that his days were numbered, and he filled them with as much intelligent love of film as possible. For those of us who were lucky enough to know Roger, his life was a gift.CommentsAmitai EtzioniProfessor of international relations, George Washington UniversityNPR\u0027s social science maven reported that President Obama may have undermined the success of gun control legislation when he stated that \"We are responsible for each other.\" Americans, Shankar Vendantam stated, care about individual rights and liberty, not the common good.Comments (23)John CorvinoChair of Philosophy, Wayne State UniversityBy spreading lies about the \"homosexual lifestyle,\" and by teaching kids, and especially vulnerable LGBT youth, that there\u0027s something sick, wrong or unnatural about being gay, folks like Rep. Dave Agema increase the suicide risk that they then turn around and use to justify their anti-gay rants.CommentsBob CescaPolitical Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowThe only jobs being creating in Rep. Tim Griffin\u0027s district are for cleanup crews to mop up the damage from the dirty fuel he continues to endorse. But I\u0027m sure the Republican voters in Faulkner County will figure out some justification for continuing to support the Keystone XL pipeline\u0027s biggest fanboy in Arkansas.Comments (388)Deepak ChopraCo-author, \u0027Super Brain: Unleashing the Explosive Power of Your Mind to Maximize Health, Happiness, and Spiritual Well-Being\u0027; founder, The Chopra FoundationWith India\u0027s vast population, there are trillions of interactions per year. If they swing too far to the negative, the society\u0027s soul is suffering a malaise.Comments (67)Dr. Peggy DrexlerAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholarAs more and more women in the workplace compete with each other for jobs, they\u0027re calling on gossip as a means to get ahead--or keep others down.Comments (216)Robert ReichChancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027Democrats invented Social Security and have been protecting it for almost 80 years. They shouldn\u0027t be leading the charge against it.Comments (464)Richard (RJ) EskowWriter; host, \u0027The Breakdown\u0027; Senior Fellow, Campaign for America\u0027s FutureHave the Wall Street Democrats of \"Third Way\" or their predecessors in the Clintonite \"Democratic Leadership Council\" ever been right about an important economic issue?Comments (46)Kirsten Gagnaire, 2013. 6.04Alexandra Katehakis, M.F.T., 2013. 5.04Stephen Estes, 2013. 5.04Ola Ojewumi, 2013. 5.04Charlie Carillo, 2013. 5.04Hermene Hartman, 2013. 5.04Yetta Kurland, 2013. 5.04Chris Weigant, 2013. 5.04Brian Secemsky, M.D., 2013. 5.04Marilyn Wedge, Ph.D., 2013. 5.04Get top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"NASA TO CAPTURE ASTEROID",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
