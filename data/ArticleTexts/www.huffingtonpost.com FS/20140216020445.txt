Despite criticism, some big-city mayors have kept schools open on snowy days this winter so their children would not go without food. These same children suffer over the weekends. While some schools have food pantries and send children home on the weekends with backpacks filled with food, it is still far, far from enough and only a drop in the bucket of need. Schools report students who arrive hungry on Monday morning or cry when they miss the bus or it’s late because that means they’ve missed breakfast.Comments (88)Ellen PageActressI\u0027m here today because I am gay.

PalermoProfessor, historian, authorIt\u0027s amazing how these people can whine in public about how they\u0027re being mistreated by people who change the sheets at the luxury hotels they stay in.

Royal Library of Denmark. The paradox of a monarchy, a real one, scrupulously attached to its etiquette and protocol, as I had the chance to observe at a gala last night at the French embassy, but one that is also, and without any contradiction, one of the most egalitarian societies that I can name.CommentsMJ RosenbergBlogger, Tikkun, Washington SpectatorIt doesn\u0027t matter what legislation AIPAC decides to push in March.
