{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonAs I\u0027ve been out on the road talking about Thrive, one question has been coming up again and again, which is some variation of, \"hey, it\u0027s OK for you to say \u0027you don\u0027t need to burnout\u0027 now that you\u0027re already successful, but what about those of us just starting out who want to succeed?\" It\u0027s a good question -- and it seems like a logical one. But its premise is actually flawed in a number of ways. It is based on the dangerous assumption that overwork and burnout are the only path to professional success. A growing number of scientific studies confirm the profound negative effects of burnout and sleep deprivation on every aspect of our health and performance. Our deluded corporate culture may still congratulate employees for working 24/7, but good ideas are much more valuable to a successful business than exhausted employees. They are the lightning in a bottle everyone is trying to capture.The international community cannot claim to care about atrocity crimes and then shrink from the commitment of resources and will required to actually prevent them. Global leaders should do more to prevent the preventable, and to counter the cruelty taking place before our eyes.Ban Ki-moonSecretary-General, United NationsIn the sixth year of the Obama presidency, how much has the president\u0027s race contributed to the implacable opposition he has faced? As the first African American to ascend to the presidency, Obama has bent over backwards to be reassuring to his white countrymen, almost to a fault.Robert KuttnerCo-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027Sometimes we are so busy, we do not realize that a few minutes of our time, a smile, or even sharing a few dollars can change the course of someone else\u0027s day.Susie MooreLife Coach, New York CityThe struggle between investor capitalists and prosumer collaboratists over control of the Internet of Things, while still embryonic, is shaping up to be the critical economic battle of the first half of the twenty-first century.Jeremy RifkinAuthor, \u0027The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of Things, the Collaborative Commons, and the Eclipse of Capitalism\u0027For the past decade or more, a bevy of very powerful people have savaged our nation\u0027s public schools while calling themselves \"reformers.\" It is perfectly clear that they have no desire to \"reform\" our public schools but to privatize and monetize them.Diane RavitchResearch Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027The shambolic US-led \"peace process\" between Israel and the Palestinian Authority is finally getting the kind of recognition it deserves.Clayton SwisherManager of investigative journalism, Al Jazeera Media NetworkNothing irritates me more than persistent half-truths and complete fabrications hyped as fact. Myths about women\u0027s sexuality are continually refurbished and bought by the masses; old morays sold as shiny new tools to be hurled as weapons of control. It\u0027s time to expose reality by shattering outdated perceptions of women who have a lot of sex.Marrie LobelSex and Relationship Writer, Geekalicious Founder of Dirty In PublicApril showers bring more Honest Slogans. Here is my fourth installment of Honest Slogans for popular brands.Clif DickensGraphic DesignerAs I stare down 40 and gear up for another phase of life, I find myself going back to the things that comforted me when I really was a teenager.Allison TateWriter, mother of fourMany charters, including those not-for-profits operated by leading de Blasio critics, are about making money for top executives. Educating children, when it actually happens, is at best a by-product.Alan SingerSocial studies educator, Hofstra UniversityWith McCutcheon, the Supreme Court laid the groundwork for eliminating the remaining \"remnant\" of our campaign finance laws in two specific ways.David EarleyBrennan Center for Justice at NYU School of LawFailing to extend unemployment benefits is nonsensical and callous. Yet, in the past three months, House Republicans have failed to consider an unemployment insurance extension eight times. Political affiliation should have no weight in determining whether to place food on the table of your constituents and lift them out of poverty.Rep. Gwen MooreU.S. Representative for Wisconsin\u0027s 4th Congressional DistrictDespite years of effort by the DOJ, Rahinah Ibrahim won her lawsuit. However, in our evolving post-Constitutional era, what that \"victory\" revealed should unnerve those who claim that if they are innocent, they have nothing to fear.Peter Van BurenAuthor of \"Ghosts of Tom Joad: A Story of the #99Percent\" and \"We Meant Well\"The minute I heard former CIA Director Michael Hayden refer to Feinstein as \"emotional,\" I rolled my eyes. This is what men do to dismiss powerful women all over the world. Then I laughed -- because clearly for all his intelligence gathering experience, Michael Hayden sure misread Dianne Feinstein.Christine PelosiChair, CA Democratic Party Women\u0027s CaucusThere has been a raging debate about the \"one-and-done\" players -- the group of basketball players that attends college for a single year, essentially biding their time until they become eligible for the NBA draft.Jonathan WeilerDirector of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel HillYour profession has been vilified, scapegoated, mined for profit, and deprofessionalized. On behalf of graduates of public schools, parents of children in public schools, those who value public education and teachers unions, we apologize.Elizabeth Weill-GreenbergBlogger\"What good is that if our babies and mothers are dying? They must be the priority.\"Mark ShriverSenior Vice President for Strategic Initiatives, Save the ChildrenSexuality is more than sex. Healthy sexual development is about creating a foundation for healthy relationships, choices and behaviors.Laura PalumboPrevention campaign specialist, National Sexual Violence Resource CenterIf the NCAA is smart, they\u0027ll come to the table and do whatever it takes to avoid a union. If they\u0027re not smart, it could be the end of college athletics as we know it. Your move, NCAA.T.J. MoeNFL free agent; former Mizzou wide receiverThe American side\u0027s ratcheting up, and rigidifying the terms of what it defines as an acceptable accord with Iran, reflects a readiness to risk seeing the talks collapse.Michael BrennerSenior Fellow, the Center for Transatlantic Relations; Professor of International Affairs, University of PittsburghFlirty texts and emails may never become physical, but that doesn\u0027t mean you\u0027re not having an affair.Loren RidingerSenior Vice President, Marketamerica.com and SHOP.COMBut then I wake up and smell the ma nishtana. If it\u0027s plutocracy, this must be Tuesday. Nice nations finish last. The golden rule isn\u0027t \"do unto others,\" it\u0027s \"don\u0027t get caught.\" Hope isn\u0027t \"the thing with feathers,\" as Emily Dickinson called it. It\u0027s the thing with denial.Marty KaplanUSC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorSquelching political corruption was the purpose of the campaign spending finance laws that the right-wing justices gutted. The spending limits shrank billionaires\u0027 ability buy politicians.Leo W. GerardInternational President, United SteelworkersHave a VERY GOOD answer for the question, \"What are you looking for?\"Susan P. JoyceEditor and chief technology writer, Job - Hunt.orgTo say that the United Nations Security Council has been underperforming or underachieving on the Syria file would be a colossal understatement. The Syrian rebellion against Bashar al-Assad is now in its fourth year -- the four deadliest years in Syria\u0027s modern history.Daniel R. DePetrisForeign Policy Consultant and Avid BloggerThere is no easy American phrase that explains that \"I could do that, but no, no I don\u0027t think I will do that, just because I don\u0027t feel like it.\" Can\u0027t Be Bothered uses minimal effort to express minimal effort.Stephanie BeTravel and Entertainment Blogger, TravelBreak.netThis week, all roads lead to National Action Network\u0027s 16th annual convention at the Sheraton New York Times Square hotel. We have undoubtedly progressed as a society, but until social justice and fairness are achieved across the board, we cannot rest. The time for action is now, and you\u0027re all invited.Rev. Al SharptonPresident, National Action NetworkThe debate over e-cigarettes has been heating up. Are the smokeless, battery-powered, nicotine-dispensing devices a gateway to smoking for young people or a helpful way for smokers to quit? Public health experts can be found on both sides of the debate.Ruth MacklinProfessor of epidemiology \u0026 population health, Albert Einstein College of MedicineThe reason that Kwasi\u0027s success doesn\u0027t depend on which school he attends is because Kwasi has cracked the \u0027big secret\u0027 that I hope to instill in every one of my students: Ultimately, the power to succeed lies in you.Erika OppenheimerSAT/ACT Test Prep CoachThis is why I can\u0027t come out to your concert, or have dinner with you, or indulge in that delicious second glass of wine. I love you. I miss you, my friends, I really do.
