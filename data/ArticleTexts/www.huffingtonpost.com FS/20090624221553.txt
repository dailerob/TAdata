Michael Calderone couldn\u0027t seem to get over the order in which Nico was called on. \"It was a departure from White House protocol,\" he fumed (the DC equivalent of \"I\u0027m telling Mom!\"). Dana Milbank opted for melodrama: \"Reporters in the room looked at each other in amazement.... Rahm Emanuel looked at the first row of TV correspondents and grinned.\" I\u0027m certain if Emanuel had a mustache, Milbank would have portrayed him twirling it. Ben Smith declared the moment \"a nice case of symbiosis, not entirely unlike the Bush administration\u0027s close ties to Fox.\" Here\u0027s an idea, before Smith decides to characterize a site maybe he could take the time to, y\u0027know, read what\u0027s on the site.Read Post | CommentsBIODavid Bromwich, 06.24.2009Professor of Literature at YaleAll vicarious politics is sick -- the more eager, excited, and fraternal, the more prone to self-deception.Read Post | Comments (67)BIOAlec Baldwin, 06.24.2009ActorWhatever personal problems that public officials deal with privately, leave them alone.
