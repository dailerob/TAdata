{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"President, Children\u0027s Defense FundGun violence is an urban problem that devastates cities like Chicago, and Detroit, and Tucson, Arizona, and Washington, D.C. Gun violence is a suburban, small town, and rural problem that devastates places like Newtown, Connecticut, and Conyers, Georgia, and Littleton and Aurora, Colorado, and Pearl, Mississippi. Gun violence is a problem in states with strong gun laws because guns still travel in from states next door. Gun violence is a problem for parents who would never dream of owning a gun and for parents whose guns are stored responsibly and safely because their children share the same playdates and parks and schools and universities and movie theaters and streets as children and adults who do have access to guns and whose family members and friends do not store them safely.Read Post | Comments (224)David Bromwich, 03/09/13Professor of Literature at YaleA mixture of aesthetic admiration for the bombing and bafflement at the meaning of the Iraq war was common even then and remains so today.

The web browser and its core feature set have become a straight jacket on innovation and is holding us back.Read Post | CommentsBob Cesca, 03/08/13Political Writer, Host of The Bob \u0026 Chez ShowThe lack of nuance, as well as the lack of a sense of history on both the far-right (and the far-left for that matter) is eerily coincidental. It\u0027s important to have oversight on drones, but let\u0027s get real here.Read Post | Comments (1,373)Jeffrey Sachs, 03/09/13Director, Earth Institute at Columbia University; Author, \u0027The Price of Civilization\u0027Spending is not spending.
