{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, President Obama\u0027s $3.7 billion request to deal with the border crisis stalled as lawmakers introduced a bill that purportedly aims to help young unaccompanied immigrants but actually just makes it easier to quickly deport them -- a measure Rep. Luis Gutierrez, a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, dismissed as \"the deportation-only agenda dressed up in sheep\u0027s clothing.\" The crisis is certainly a chance to look in the mirror and decide what kind of nation we want to be: one that holds up \"return to sender\" signs and walks through towns with AR-15 rifles to protest the possible arrival of a few busloads of Central American children (as happened in Arizona and Michigan respectively), or one that decries \"racist and xenophobic attitudes,\" as Pope Francis urged on Monday, and lives up to our founding principles as a nation of immigrants. Hanging in the balance isn\u0027t just which direction the children will go in, but the rest of us, as well.My Twitter feed has been raging with information and disinformation today, but underneath the diatribes I have been struck by a sense of despair and disbelief that the world can unravel this fast and anger at our sense of impotence.Executive Religion Editor, The Huffington PostAt a time when hundreds of rockets are fired by Hamas and Islamic Jihad from Gaza against Israel -- threatening population centers, including Jerusalem and Tel Aviv -- criticizing Israel\u0027s occupation of the West Bank would seem inappropriate at best.Senior Fellow, NYU\u0027s Center for Global AffairsIt\u0027s the middle of summer, which means two things: All over the country people are going on vacation, and Washington, D.C. is a mess. Might part of the reason be that, while most people recognize the benefits of unplugging, recharging and renewing in the summer, our politicians spend the season tethered to the same hamster wheel?When my interview with Elaine Stritch aired on \"So What Else Is News?\" -- my Air America Radio show back in the day -- someone wrote me saying I laughed way too hard in it. I wrote back that it was because I was terrified of her.USC Annenberg professor and Norman Lear Center directorIf present trends continue, the U.S. will have a dual system of education in another decade. What is at stake is the great tradition of public schools, open to all, supported by all, controlled by the public, not corporations.Research Professor of Education, New York University; Author, \u0027Reign of Error\u0027If Steinbeck\u0027s woman character is purely a victim, why is she so hated? And if she is truly harmless, why is she so threatening? Without question, it was a commentary on the social climate at the time, which still surprisingly applies today.ActressI suspect that when the histories are written, this will be deemed the day the insurgency lost.Professor of Global Affairs at NYU’s Center for Global Affairs; Founding Editor of the journal \u0027Global Crime\u0027Last week, Obama administration lawyers filed a stack of documents in a case about my husband -- including sealed videos of him being taken to be force-fed at Guantanamo Bay. I don\u0027t think I could bear to see those videos. It shocks me, though, that the American people may never be given the opportunity to see for themselves what is happening in their name.Wife of cleared Guantanamo detainee Abu Wa\u0027el DhiabThe next time you hear about migrant children near the border, just picture them as your own. Then think what you would want our government to do.President, National Action NetworkHeadless bodies. Screaming children. Entire neighborhoods fleeing on foot. The unmistakable sounds of Hamas rockets and the booms of Israeli strikes. Here\u0027s a look at what I\u0027ve witnessed this week in Gaza.Middle East correspondent, The WorldPostUnder cover of \"the defense of Palestine,\" thousands gathered in Paris on Sunday to blame the Jews once again. They need to be reminded, for what it\u0027s worth, that conflating Jews and Israelis in the same condemnation is the very principle of anti-Semitism, which, in France, is punishable by law.Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.Walking home from the Capitol recently, I saw the words engraved above the portico of the Supreme Court: \"Equal justice under law.\" They don\u0027t say \"equal justice under law except for women.\" They don\u0027t say \"equal justice as long as it\u0027s OK with your boss.\" And yet that is exactly what the court majority said in its ruling.U.S. Senator from CaliforniaThere will be no peace, for now, as Gaza is turned into an abattoir, to collectively punish Gazans for supporting Hamas. Israel, as any nation, has a right to defend itself, but it confuses offense with defense. It is on the offensive in Gaza.Fmr. 16-year Member of US Congress; Two-time US Presidential CandidateI feel like I\u0027m constantly reminded of how dogs bring alive the Third Metric values of well-being, wisdom, wonder and giving. They bring us joy. They keep us in the present moment. They make us laugh. They touch our hearts in the most unique way.Wellness Editor, The Huffington Post; Doctor of acupuncture and Oriental medicine; Nutritionist; AuthorHumans have been looking for the giant squid ever since we first started taking pictures underwater. But the elusive deep-sea predator could never be caught on film -- until now.\"Ideas Worth Spreading\"Tonight, at the All Star Game, Major League Baseball will honor a great, brave man -- an athlete who had to hide behind fear and shame while still trying to live up to his God-given potential as a ball player.Actress and children\u0027s book authorSeventeen years later, I find that I\u0027m again constantly thinking about solitary confinement. The horror stories that drive the public conversation about solitary are not stories to me, but memories.Yale Law School student, author, and legal intern at the ACLUYou hear these stories all the time in Africa -- the brutality, the never-ending death and starvation. It\u0027s easy to become immune. And then you meet someone like Rebecca. She says she misses the way her husband made her laugh.ActressHer remark is an apt credo for a party leadership that has spent the last quarter-century serving corporate power as persistently as it spews out empty rhetoric about \"the needs of working families.\"Author and media criticIt\u0027s time to be intentional and make working out your heart as important as working out your body, not just for the health benefits but also to be your best self and contribute to a better world.HuffPost Blog/Third Metric FellowIt is, one would hope, highly unlikely that the religious test issue will ever again come before the Supreme Court. But if it does, who knows what these five justices will do?Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoPutin\u0027s silence, which effectively condones the terrorists\u0027 activities in eastern Ukraine, bares a grave cost. Ending the violence has been the essence of an agreement reached in Geneva many months ago to which Russia was a signatory.Member of the Ukrainian Parliament (Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine)After a recent public talk, I shocked the crowd by admitting that the Levi\u0027s jeans I was wearing that day \"hadn\u0027t seen the inside of a washing machine.\" Now, everywhere I go, the first thing people say to me is \"Oh, you\u0027re the guy who never washes his jeans!\"President and CEO of Levi Strauss \u0026 CoIf my son is gay, so be it. Maybe he is. Maybe he\u0027s not. Maybe he\u0027ll be a cross dresser. Maybe not. I have no control over any of it. All I can do is be supportive.Writer, Actor, Dad.It\u0027s easy to forget in our culture of celebrity gossip and social media overshares that most married people live very private lives. Marriage, even bad marriage, is an intimate thing very often crafted of secret histories and shared truths.Author, research psychologist and gender scholarEquity matters more than equality. Differences in pay aren\u0027t a problem as long as they\u0027re fair. When players are paid less than teammates who aren\u0027t performing any better, jealousy, resentfulness and discouragement often follow.Wharton professor and author, \u0027Give and Take\u0027I met my wife, Joy Carroll, at Greenbelt, a summer festival of faith, arts and justice in England. I have a vivid memory of returning to Greenbelt in 2002 with our son Luke. Joy was on the worship platform celebrating the Eucharist for 20,000 people. Luke looked up at me and said, \"Daddy, can men do that too?\"Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersSuddenly, that person you fell in love with is kissing his daughter\u0027s boo-boos, tossing his son in the air and working to support a family. Just as I fell in love with my spouse, every day I fall in love with this man who is traveling with me on this crazy adventure called parenthood.Author, blogger at MommyAtoZBlog.comThe truth of the matter was this: I did not go out of my way to \"invent\" penalties on Eric Lindros -- or any player -- but I wasn\u0027t going to give that guy a break on anything borderline that I might have let slide with a player who had gained acceptability with me.Retired NHL Player and NHL Referee, ECAC Director of Hockey Officiating, Chairman KHL Officiating Evaluation and Discipline CommitteesThe Palestinians of Gaza are guilty of that new post-Cold War misdemeanor: voting while Muslim. The punishment for this crime has been eight years of economic hardship, international isolation and periodic Israeli bombardments.Co-director, Foreign Policy In FocusGet top stories and blogs posts emailed to you each day.","h1":"U.S. INTEL: RUSSIA COMPLICIT REPORT: U.S. Officials Believe Missiles Moved Back Into Russia After Plane Was Shot Down...
