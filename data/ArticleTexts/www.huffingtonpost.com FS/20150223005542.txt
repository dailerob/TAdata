{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Tonight, after an interminable build-up, we finally find out who will take home an Oscar -- and who will be forced to smile gamely when someone else\u0027s name is called. My can\u0027t-miss prediction: there will be at least two Fifty Shades of Grey jokes. Back in the real world, Walmart, the nation\u0027s largest employer, announced plans to hike its minimum wage. As the White House tweeted, \"Good to see @Walmart raising wages for about 500,000 employees. Now it\u0027s time for Congress to #RaiseTheWage.\" On a sad note, Oliver Sacks announced that he has terminal cancer. He\u0027s taught us so much over the years, and continues to do so now about one of life\u0027s most challenging subjects: dying. \"I feel a sudden clear focus and perspective. There is no time for anything inessential,\" he writes. \"I cannot pretend I am without fear. But my predominant feeling is one of gratitude.\" Ours, too -- for this vital and timeless lesson.My president doesn\u0027t love me. How sad! But forget me, I\u0027m just another citizen. The real tragedy here, I just learned, is that the president doesn\u0027t love Rudy Giuliani, a man who was an honest-to-God elected official.Founder, People for the American WayThe first presidential primary is underway, not simply because the political press cannot wait but because he or she who signs up the most megabucks wins that primary and is well on the way to a nomination. Step right up and participate--that is if you can write a very large check.United States Senator (Ret.)We need to stop using military force as a solution to everything -- indeed, it is a solution to nothing. We must push for the repeal of the 2001 AUMF and prevent the passage of a new AUMF. We cannot rely on Congress or the president to reverse the course of rampant U.S. militarism. It is up to us to make our voices heard.Professor, Thomas Jefferson School of LawRapid Isolation and Treatment of Ebola (RITE) teams in Liberia are slowing the epidemic, and CDC is working closely with governments and partners in Guinea and Sierra Leone to adopt similar rapid response strategies.Director, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)I call upon all defenders of freedom to join the ideological battle; now is the time to set pluralism against dogma; drawings, books and peaceful protests against guns; secularism against religious dominance.Activist, leader of FEMEN women\u0027s movementYou know you\u0027re a bigot when you can\u0027t take out the word \"Muslim\" from a sentence you stated and replace it with \"Jew\" and still have it be socially acceptable. Let\u0027s start out nice and easy. A sentence I get with great regularity: \"You\u0027re a Muslim apologist.\"Host, \u0027The Young Turks\u0027We are at a place in time when fellow artists can raise one another up and sponsor one another into an age of creative freedom. And in the future ahead, what we have to look forward to, as a community, is a new wave of creative expression.Members of the group TLCAmerica is the land of breakthrough science -- and health care scams. There is no question that Solvadi is a lifesaver for millions of Americans infected by Hepatitis C. Yet Solvadi is also the poster child of a U.S. health care system that is being bankrupted by greed, lobbying and indefensible policies on drug pricing.Director, Earth Institute at Columbia UniversityA high-quality public education can unlock our children\u0027s potential. It can bring communities together. It can ensure a top-notch workforce for our economy and an engaged citizenry for our democracy. We have an opportunity with the ESEA reauthorization to help reclaim the promise of public education.President, American Federation of TeachersRestated for the 21st century, \"socialism\" simply means that a people\u0027s judgments about its own economic life come before the supposedly iron rules of the international economy. It would be fair to call it \"economic democracy.\" The condescending view of the Greeks as somehow not understanding economic reason and the direction of history writes off this kind of economic democracy as infeasible, archaic, and probably senseless.Professor, Duke Law School; Author, \u0027A Tolerable Anarchy\u0027The new Greek government needs support in establishing pro-growth policies which create jobs, expand their economy and enable them to pay down their debts. Demanding that creditors are paid before any of that is allowed to happen may come at a very heavy price for more than just the people of Greece.Independent U.S. Senator from VermontContinue to rise and lift up your sisters and brothers who are also experiencing discrimination and abuse. Continue to strive for excellence in all of your endeavors, undaunted by the bad behavior of others.Chief Executive Officer, The King CenterOn February 26, the FCC will do something that few have ever accused the government of doing. It will recognize reality and act appropriately.Communications consultantAs a gift for Putin\u0027s 58th birthday, twelve female students and alumni of Moscow State University\u0027s prestigious journalism department published a calendar featuring photos of themselves in lingerie, each woman suggesting herself as a potential lover for Putin.Author of Sex, Politics, and Putin: Political Legitimacy in RussiaEddie Routh is reminiscent of the 20-year-old Army private, David Lawrence, deployed to Afghanistan, who on October 17, 2010, shot and killed a captured Taliban soldier he had arranged to guard. Controversy ensued: was he a criminal or mentally ill? Was he feigning madness to elude punishment?Medical director, New York State Office of Mental HealthTo be the guest of a great lord in his castle was an honor reserved for notable visitors known to the host, but others would arrive with a letter of introduction from the king or queen or a member of their family or friends of the host.Author and Historian; author of the acclaimed Anjou Trilogy and frequent lecturer and historical writer.The history in Internet innovation is the story of outsiders building a better mouse trap -- kids, dropouts, and non-Americans, given a neutral platform to prove their ideas. It was neutral because it was built that way.Author, \u0027Republic, Lost\u0027; Founder, RootstrikersBeing a feminist does not provide a \"get out of racism free\" card, and that is the card Iggy has been playing over and over since her rise to fame, which a lot of folks seem to have a whole deck of, from dismissive reactions to Susan B. Anthony\u0027s racism to flippancy regarding Madonna\u0027s use of the N-word.Poet, author, and activistFor anyone who served on the ground in Iraq there is something horrifying about the idea of the ideologically blind, strategically ignorant \"thinkers\" -- Paul Wolfowitz chief among them -- who sent us into a misguided war without a plan to win the peace coming back into office. And yet, Jeb wants to get the gang back together.U.S. Representative, Arizona\u0027s 7th Congressional District; Iraq War veteranUnderneath his shirt when the Paris Saint-German football club played against Caen at Parc des Princes, Zlatan had tattooed fifty names -- names of people he\u0027d never met, but who were very special to him.Director of the United Nations World Food Programme for France and Principality of Monaco (Paris)We as Americans and others in the West have long overlooked the ways our actions affect the world around us -- both in positive and negative ways. Lent must be a time to reflect and repent -- in our own lives, in our churches, and in our nation. It\u0027s time to turn around.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersPersonal satisfaction and serving others does go hand-in-hand. The general hopelessness about relationships and life I previously felt was like a sickness in my soul. Doing random acts of kindness is a giddy remedy I would recommend to anyone for these reasons.Blog Editor, The Huffington PostI believe that there is no better choice than to help the Kurds help us vanquish the unparalleled barbarity of the beheaders of the Islamic State. So, yes, weapons. An alliance without reservations or hidden agendas. Perhaps even a major \"Erbil conference.\"Bernard-Henri Levy is a French philosopher and writer.For fifty years Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) has been the primary source of federal funding targeted to schools to serve poor children. Sadly, from the beginning states didn\u0027t keep their end of the bargain.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundWhether this ceasefire or some future one proves durable, Ukraine must eventually make some very difficult decisions concerning its future. Above all, it must figure out a way of exiting the steel trap that has clamped down on its nether regions. The Crimean peninsula has already been sliced off. Should Ukraine sever another one of its own limbs in order to survive?Director, Foreign Policy In Focus and Editor, LobeLogYou want to really blow people\u0027s minds? Try this at home: Be fat and happy. Be unapologetically fat. Wear a bikini, and mean it. Eat pizza and ice cream and enjoy it. Drink up your life and a bottle of wine, and make no apologies.There\u0027s no wrong way to be a woman.After the murderous attacks in Paris and Copenhagen, one might wonder whether a newspaper that published the Charlie Hebdo cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad in the United States would be protected by the First Amendment. The government might make two primary arguments in support of a law prohibiting the publication of the cartoons.Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoCome with me. Let\u0027s open the door to a parallel universe. Here in this parallel world, the rules are different because gender roles are flipped. Loving parents and teachers accept this strange culture as if it\u0027s not so bad, or perhaps even good.Educational psychologist, consultant, and author of Her Next ChapterRepublicans feared that trying to pay for their tax cuts by shifting to the highly uncertain dynamic scoring may not be enough. So they are further trying to rig the system with baseline games and make permanent tax provisions outside tax reform.Sandy Levin is the Ranking Member of the House Ways and Means CommitteeWe aren\u0027t here to judge -- and we have seen and heard worse, I promise. Please, tell the truth. I can\u0027t take care of your child (or you) if you don\u0027t.Pediatrician, Boston Children\u0027s Hospital, Harvard Medical SchoolGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..","h1":"ROCKY WALKER",".title":"More in PoliticsYou might also likeMore in BusinessYou might also likeMore in EntertainmentYou might also likeMore in TechYou might also likeMore in MediaYou might also likeMore in WorldPostYou might also likeMore in Healthy LivingYou might also likeMore in ComedyYou might also likeNewsEntertainmentLife \u0026 StyleTech \u0026 ScienceVoicesLocalOur Mobile Apps","h2":"Using a mobile device?
