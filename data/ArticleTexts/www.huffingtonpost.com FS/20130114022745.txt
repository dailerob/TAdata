{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Editorial director, Huffington Post Media GroupA new Huffington Post/YouGov poll shows voters modestly hopeful about Barack Obama\u0027s chances of being more successful in his second term. And, given the haplessness of his Republican foes, Obama is in an unusually strong position to deliver on the potential of his second term -- but only if he has the will and wherewithal to turn ballot-box victory into real-life results. That\u0027s the bottom line of an in-depth survey by The Huffington Post of the problems and prospects facing the president as he prepares for a second inauguration. Today we launch a series of stories giving you in-depth results of that survey: 20 reported pieces during the next week, 14 from the U.S. and six from overseas; pairs of expert blog posts published with each domestic story; HuffPost Live video interviews with reporters; and poll data from HuffPost/YouGov.Read Post | CommentsJohn Irons, 01/14/13Managing Director of Foundation Initiatives, Rockefeller FoundationThere are two challenges that threaten to have lasting consequences for individuals and the broader economy, and which won\u0027t be solved by congressional quick fixes: high levels of long-term unemployment, and stagnation of career development for young people.Read Post | CommentsRobert P. Stoker, 01/14/13Associate professor of political science, public policy and public administration, George Washington UniversityAlthough Obama has considered the chained CPI, he has also advocated raising the FICA tax cap. His proposal does not go far enough to preserve Social Security. A better alternative is to expand the tax base, not merely by increasing the FICA tax cap but by taxing other income sources.Read Post | CommentsJohn Cusack, 01/14/13Makes filmsRecently, I sat down with George Washington Law School professor and constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley and my close friend Kevin McCabe to discuss WikiLeaks\u0027 impact on transparency, the government\u0027s response, and the comparison to the Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg.Read Post | CommentsRobert Kuttner, 01/13/13Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027On budget issues, Obama has been just dismal. One can only conclude that he is in bed with the wrong people -- those who believe that the road to prosperity is through austerity.Read Post | CommentsMaureen Ryan, 01/14/13TV critic, The Huffington PostJodie Foster wittily surveyed her career and broached the topic of her sexual orientation in front of millions of people (even if she never said the words \"gay\" or \"lesbian,\" her meaning was clear).Read Post | CommentsLawrence Lessig, 01/13/13Author, \u0027Republic, Lost\u0027; Founder, RootstrikersThe billions of snippets of sadness and bewilderment spinning across the Net confirm who this amazing boy Aaron Swartz was to all of us. It angers me that he did what he did. But if we\u0027re going to learn from this, we can\u0027t let slide what brought him here.Read Post | Comments (62)Ted Danson and Andrew Sharpless, 01/13/13The Department of the Interior must reassess its decisions that allowed Shell to proceed with its plans to drill in such a harsh but ecologically-sensitive area of the world.Read Post | CommentsMichael Hogan, 01/12/13Executive Arts and Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post Media GroupDeception swirled upstairs and down and sudden revelations brought both salvation and devastation in tonight\u0027s episode of \"Downton Abbey\" -- but, hey, what else should we expect from everyone\u0027s favorite purveyor of class-system porn?Read Post | CommentsDr. Peggy Drexler, 01/12/13Author, research psychologist and gender scholarEven as our acceptance of less rigid gender roles grows in other areas, the pressure on boys to be \"toned and muscular\" represents a return to a traditional notion of masculinity and what it means to be a man. The message: It\u0027s fine if boys want to go around wearing sparkly nail polish as kids, as long as they grow up to be big and strong and macho.Read Post | Comments (270)James Zogby, 01/12/13President, Arab American Institute; author, \u0027Arab Voices\u0027What is at stake for Republicans is far more than just Israel and Iran. It is the entire neo-conservative enterprise that led the U.S. into two failed wars in Afghanistan and Iraq (which they cannot admit were failures) and has them still advocating for more aggressive military engagements in Syria and Iran.Read Post | Comments (220)Michael Strahan, 01/12/13NFL Superbowl Champion and On-Air Commentator \u0026 HostMany of you know me as Michael Strahan the NFL football player and as Kelly\u0027s sidekick on LIVE! with Kelly and Michael. What you don\u0027t know about me is that I have a side to me that likes to give back, especially for children who are underprivileged and battling causes in order to save their lives.Read Post | CommentsDaniel Ellsberg, 01/13/13Former American military analyst who sparked a national uproar in 1971.The mystique of secrecy in the universe of national security, even beyond the formal apparatus of classification and clearances, is a compelling deterrent to whistleblowing and thus to effective resistance to gravely wrongful or dangerous policies.Read Post | CommentsDan Froomkin, 01/12/13Contributing editor, Nieman ReportsWhy did Obama wait two years to \"change his mind,\" and four years to pull out? Over 1,300 American servicemembers have died in Afghanistan since the summer of 2009 -- well over half of all the dead during the entire war. When did he know it was hopeless?Read Post | Comments (191)HuffPost Radio, 01/13/13Reagan \u0026 Matalin debate why Hagel is on defense over going to Defense. Since he\u0027s a wounded warrior who reflects the re-elected president\u0027s views -- with no John Tower problems -- he\u0027ll likely end up on top. NRA? Mary says ok to universal background checks but not \"liberal shibboleths.\"Read Post | CommentsAmanda Magee, 01/13/13Advertising professional and blogger, amandamagee.comLately, Briar has been preoccupied with the idea of growing up. She seems convinced that by doing so, I will somehow cease to be her mom. Last night, after her sisters had been tucked in, we talked nose-to-nose about what growing up really means.Read Post | Comments (19)Amb. Swanee Hunt, 01/12/13Lecturer in public policy at Harvard, former ambassador to AustriaWomen may be our best chance at breaking through disastrous partisan gridlock. In a dozen other settings, Washington women continually put aside partisanship to jointly lead caucuses or committees, dine together regularly, and take turns batting and fielding.Read Post | Comments (18)Brynn Tannehill, 01/12/13Defense research scientistAs it happened, coming out as trans to my spouse was wrenching for both of us, and it took the better part of six months for each of us to convince the other that we didn\u0027t want to leave. We were going to give it our best shot, whatever came.Read Post | Comments (144)Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, 01/13/13Rabbi and WriterWhy are relationships on the decline? Because the advice being given is flawed. It emphasizes the cozy, warm, fuzzy emotion of love over the super-charged, deeply erotic, electrifying feeling of lust.Read Post | CommentsLeslie Clarke, 01/12/13Teacher, coach, consultantLess than nine months ago, my 17-year-old, biracial son took his life. My belief is that he died not just of suicide but of a broken heart, tired of this violent world.Read Post | Comments (87)Scott Mendelson, 01/13/13Film critic at Mendelson\u0027s Memos, Valley Scene MagazineKathryn Bigelow\u0027s Zero Dark Thirty finally went wide this weekend and it grossed $24 million to top the weekend box office. All eyes were on this one, with the big question being whether critical acclaim and film punditry would translate into mainstream interest.Read Post | CommentsJanine Driver, 01/12/13Founder and president, the Body Language Institute; Author, \u0027You Say More Than You Think\u0027Pay attention to these four areas of your body and you are on your way to being the alpha in your pack.Read Post | CommentsSteven Strauss, 01/13/13Adjunct Lecturer in Public Policy, Harvard Kennedy SchoolShootings in our schools are tragic, and each of us has the urge to \"do something,\" but I have major concerns about placing armed guards in our schools.Read Post | CommentsDan Kennedy, 01/13/13Assistant Professor, School of Journalism at Northeastern UniversityNothing good can come from Aaron Swartz\u0027s death. But at the very least it should prompt consideration of why such brutality has become a routine part of the American system of justice.Read Post | CommentsSheila Quirke, 01/12/13Mary Tyler MomForgetting that you still have much to learn is the fast track to aging.Read Post | CommentsPeter Dreier, 01/13/13E.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental CollegeThe NRA is primarily a front group for the nation\u0027s gun manufacturers. But you wouldn\u0027t know it from reading the major media outlets.Read Post | Comments (78)Tracy Schorn, 01/12/13Blogger at Chump Lady, Journalist, CartoonistI don\u0027t fault betrayed people for wanting revenge.

Since then I\u0027ve realized that her gift was an opportunity to finally find the fortitude and the wisdom to do what she never could. So I left him behind. And that\u0027s where he remains: behind me.Read Post | Comments (66)Bruce Piasecki, 01/13/13President and founder, AHC GroupLance Armstrong\u0027s downfall is a striking example of what can go wrong in teams.
