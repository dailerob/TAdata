{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, President Obama\u0027s initial proposal in the fiscal cliff showdown sparked merriment and outrage from Republican leaders, who pretended they hadn\u0027t heard the same details six weeks ago. Susan Rice continued to have nomination meetings even without a nomination, but failed to win over GOP senators who are still \"troubled\" by Benghazi but not by their own failure of judgment on Iraq. Palestine scored a victory at the U.N., where it was given non-participating observer status -- the same status Mitt Romney has in U.S. politics. Romney was invited to the White House for lunch, where he and the president dined on white turkey chili [insert your own \"white turkey\" punchline here]. Meanwhile, revised figures show the U.S. economy had its best third-quarter performance in five years. How this fits into Jack Welch\u0027s conspiracy theories about \"imagination defying\" government stats, we\u0027ll just have to wait and see.Read Post | CommentsOprah Winfrey, 11/27/12Chairman and CEO, Oprah Winfrey NetworkForgiveness doesn\u0027t mean you condone the behavior or, in any way, make a wrong right. It just means you give yourself permission to release from your past -- and step forward with the mud of resentment cleared from your wings.Read Post | Comments (222)Julian Assange, 11/29/12Editor-in-Chief and Founder, WikiLeaksThe information WikiLeaks has disclosed frustrates the controlled political discourse that is trumpeted by establishment media and Western governments to shape public perception. We will continue our fight against the financial blockade, and we will continue to publish.Read Post | Comments (1,979)Arianna Huffington, 11/27/12This is the time for both Congress and the White House to be bold. President Obama still has the opportunity to be a transformational president, but only if he spends his second term finally unleashing the audacity that propelled his presidency in the beginning -- on issues from gun control and the failed drug war to privacy and drones.Read Post | Comments (545)Barbra Streisand, 11/30/12Singer; Actress; Director; Composer; ActivistEven when the Obama administration is being transparent and forthcoming, even as they are wanting and willing to learn from the mistakes of Benghazi, where unfortunately four people died, Senator McCain refuses to back down.Read Post | Comments (694)Ralph Nader, 11/30/12Consumer advocate, lawyer and authorThe holidays, once considered a sacred time for family and celebration, have been hijacked by big companies sending out a message to the American people, playing on an endless loop: \"Buy, buy, buy!\"Read Post | Comments (177)Lisa Belkin, 11/28/12Senior Columnist on Life/Work/Family, The Huffington PostIt\u0027s just that we don\u0027t have a lot of other pregnant Fortune 500 superstars to look to, so we held you up as a role model and now we worry that you\u0027re modeling the wrong thing. When there are dozens more of you we will probably stop paying attention.Read Post | Comments (743)Tony Blair, 11/26/12Former Prime Minister of BritainI shall resist the temptation of being the Brit outside the euro trying to tell everyone inside why it was a bad idea. First, because I don\u0027t think it is a bad idea. In principle, a single currency along with a single market makes sense for Europe. Second, because in any event, we are where we are.Read Post | Comments (133)Marlo Thomas, 11/27/12Award-winning actress, author and activistDid you know that a man\u0027s excess belly fat can decrease his libido? Were you aware that frequent sex in a strong relationship can actually increase your longevity? And you really should know that you probably have undiscovered erogenous zones all over your body. See what else we learned from the like of Dr. Oz, Pepper Schwartz and more.Read Post | Comments (168)Lincoln Mitchell, 11/29/12Harriman Institute, Columbia UniversityThere is no inevitable link between conservatism and stupidity, but one could be forgiven for coming to that conclusion while watching Fox News.Read Post | Comments (1,180)Jamie Lee Curtis, 11/27/12Actress and children\u0027s book authorI knew Deborah Raffin a long time ago, when both our skin was young and taut and her beauty was in full bloom. She was a well known model/actress, her jaw slacking beauty belied her talent. Classic lines and talent to boot.Read Post | Comments (23)Jared Bernstein, 12/01/12Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorWhile official poverty rates -- which exclude much of the value of the safety net -- increased from 12.5 percent to 15 percent, 2007-11, the alternative measure, though higher at a point in time (accurately measured, there are more poor people than the official measure reveals), was essentially unchanged.Read Post | Comments (274)June Cohen, 11/30/12Executive Producer, TED MediaFew of us come face-to-face with death in such a clear and present way as Ric Elias, who was on board Flight 1549 when it crash-landed on New York\u0027s Hudson River four years ago.Read Post | Comments (571)Cecile Richards, 11/30/12President of Planned Parenthood Federation of America and Planned Parenthood Action FundAccess to health care for millions of women is on the line if Congress fails to act and the fiscal cliff\u0027s mandatory budget cuts take effect.Read Post | Comments (107)Dr. Michael J. Breus, 12/01/12Clinical Psychologist; Board Certified Sleep SpecialistBiological changes are an important part of the teen-sleep picture, but they don\u0027t tell the whole story. Combined with these biological shifts are environmental and lifestyle factors that also can interfere with teens\u0027 sleep.Read Post | Comments (14)Donald Sutherland, 12/01/12ActorIf you don\u0027t think it is, then how in the devil did the Republicans manage to persuade the Democrats that Social Security is!Read Post | Comments (137)Susan Blumenthal, M.D., 12/01/12Public Health Editor at HuffPost and Former U.S. Assistant Surgeon GeneralThis World AIDS Day is a celebration of the achievements that have been made and the acceleration of progress in recent years, providing proof that ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic is not only feasible but achievable.Read Post | CommentsRob Reiner, Bruce Cohen and Michele Reiner, 11/28/12There will be a natural tendency to focus on the legal challenges and the political fights, but history will show the true story of how we achieved marriage equality and how it was in fact a quilt woven of thousands of personal tales, most of which existed entirely outside the courtroom.Read Post | Comments (172)Christine Hayes, 11/26/12Author, \u0027Introduction to the Bible\u0027When it comes to the Bible, modern Americans are at a distinct disadvantage. They know both too much and too little.Read Post | Comments (3,139)George Soros, 11/30/12Chairman, Soros Fund Management, LLC; Founder, The Open Society InstituteWhen the European Union was only an idea, a fantastic object, it was conceived as an instrument of solidarity. Today, Europe hangs together out of grim necessity. That is not conducive to a harmonious partnership.Read Post | Comments (100)Dr. Peggy Drexler, 12/01/12Author, research psychologist and gender scholarThis year, Clinton has been called, at turns, \"the coolest person on the planet\" and \"The James Dean of our generation.\" Here was a woman so many other women could either relate to or emulate: A woman who got things done -- and then went and had a beer.Read Post | Comments (123)Robert L. Borosage, 11/30/12President, Institute for America\u0027s FuturePressure for a deal to avoid the so-called \"fiscal cliff\" at the end of the year is building. Even minor tremors in the stock market are treated as auguries of the panic that will attend a failure to act.Read Post | Comments (449)Toni Collette, 11/29/12Award-Winning Actress, Singer and Humanitarian AdvocateFor most of us, it is almost impossible to imagine food being hard to come by. The harsh reality is that hunger and malnutrition are the biggest public health threats in our world today. We lose a child every six seconds because of hunger. As a mother, I can\u0027t accept that.Read Post | Comments (30)Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, 11/28/12U.S. Senator from New YorkThe fact is, as a consequence of unprecedented obstructionism during the last Congress, the filibuster was used more in two years than it had been in the 1950s, \u002760s and \u002770s combined. This is unacceptable.Read Post | Comments (301)Tiësto, 11/29/12Musician, DJ and producerWhen I got together with the team at (RED) and they shared with me their mission to help the global health community deliver an AIDS Free Generation by 2015, there was only one way to go.
