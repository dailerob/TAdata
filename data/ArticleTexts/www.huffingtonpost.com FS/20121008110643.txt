{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Co-founder and co-editor, \u0027The American Prospect\u0027It\u0027s OK to attack. There is a sweet spot between nasty and feeble. Your handlers who advised you to stick to the high road and the scripted talking points are idiots. They had front-runner disease -- which then mixed with your own excessive tendency to caution and diffidence. The TV spots, campaign surrogates, and media fact-checks can rebut Romney\u0027s serial lies until the cows come home -- but it\u0027s no substitute for you finding a voice that calls him on the lies yourself, to his face. If you can\u0027t find that voice, you are toast and so are we. But I suspect that you can. Yes we can.Read Post | Comments (122)Gary Hart, 10/07/12President, Hart International, Ltd.Myths play a central role as metaphor in many world religions, but myths in politics are dangerous. They are a conscious hiding place from a changing, challenging, and often uncomfortable new world.Read Post | Comments (84)Jared Bernstein, 10/07/12Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorThere\u0027s a time for larger deficits and a time to be moving toward budget surplus. We want and need cyclical budget deficits to offset slumps; we do not want structural budget deficits that get larger when the economy hits its expansionary stride, which it has not as of yet.Read Post | Comments (67)HuffPost Radio, 10/07/12Arianna and Nicolle Wallace debate why Romney won and how Obama adjusts. But if your opponent is a quick-change artist and fibber, how should you reply in a non-whiny way? The women then agree about \"media bias\" and Fox\u0027s 2007 Obama \"too black\" tape.Read Post | CommentsKatla McGlynn, 10/01/12Comedy Editor, The Huffington PostWhen Seinfeld disappeared in 1998, he left America in a feel-good era, hungry for more sublime chatter about nothing. We welcome him back not as a comedian whose material has gotten better with age -- or one recovering from a period of decline -- but as we would a 90s time capsule.Read Post | Comments (111)Menachem Rosensaft, 10/08/12Professor of law and son of Holocaust survivorsHere are three issues Governor Romney should be asked about at the next debate or in any media interviews he might give between now and Election Day.Read Post | CommentsRaymond J. Learsy, 10/07/12Author, \u0027Oil and Finance: The Epic Corruption Continues\u0027Governor Romney may call himself a Republican, but he is not a Republican of the iconic stature of President Reagan. President Reagan fully understood the importance of the arts to the formation of the nation\u0027s character.Read Post | Comments (78)Leo W. Gerard, 10/08/12International President, United SteelworkersNow you see severely conservative Romney, now you don\u0027t. The GOP nominee asks Americans to engage in magical thinking -- to believe his hocus-pocus is not just a stage show but will actually painlessly solve problems.Read Post | CommentsSusan McBride, 10/06/12Author, \u0027IN THE PINK: How I Met the Perfect (Younger) Man, Survived Breast Cancer, and Found True Happiness After 40\u0027Will I ever take my health for granted again? No. That\u0027s why I get nervous every six months when I have my regular boobal check-ups and why I see my doctors whenever anything feels the slightest bit wonky.Read Post | Comments (12)Christopher Elliott, 10/08/12Author of the book Scammed: How to Save Your Money and Find Better Service in a World of Schemes, Swindles and Shady DealsSome passengers understand that airport screening is a game and they seem ready to turn the tables.Read Post | CommentsMichael Hogan, 10/07/12Executive Arts and Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post Media GroupYou\u0027ve got to hand it to the writers of \"Homeland\": They don\u0027t play it safe.

So what do we do?Read Post | Comments (56)Alan Schroeder, 10/07/12Professor of Journalism, Northeastern UniversityReportedly it was the Obama campaign that insisted on lecterns, deeming them more presidential. Yet in several ways this preference ended up hurting Barack Obama.Read Post | CommentsMichael Shank, 10/07/12George Mason University Adjunct ProfessorOur founding fathers and mothers would be ashamed at how we\u0027re using free speech to freely and openly hate on each other. This gross manifestation is not what they fought for, nor should it be what we fight for now.Read Post | Comments (37)Edward Goldberg, 10/07/12Professor, Zicklin Graduate School of Business, Baruch College; President, Annisa GroupRomney\u0027s statements on foreign affairs are at best strangely naïve or overtly political. They ignore a basic rule of decision making, that when there are no precedents, leadership needs to be based on the understanding of the current realities and not on the past or on fears of one\u0027s constituents.Read Post | Comments (22)Mike Ryan, 10/07/12Senior Entertainment Writer, The Huffington PostAs host of Saturday Night Live, Daniel Craig seemed raring to go -- he was practically screaming, \"I want to prove to you that I am funny!

And for Vice President Biden, the pressure is high to halt the Romney-Ryan debate momentum.Read Post | Comments (24)John Lundberg, 10/07/12Writer, Poetry teacherEven those who don\u0027t love poetry should take some time to reflect on the courageous life and works of Nguyen Chi Thien, who passed away on Tuesday at a hospital in Santa Ana, California at the age of 73.Read Post | CommentsGeorge Heymont, 10/07/12San Francisco-based arts criticEvery body needs a buddy. That buddy may come in the form of a coroner who is totally dedicated to his work or a mortician who loves the smell of formaldehyde.Read Post | CommentsJane Devin, 10/07/12Cultural critic, essayist, and authorGuiliani says he\u0027s never seen a guy change his mind on so many things. Brit Hume thinks Romney has exhausted his quota for flip-flops. Santorum believes he has no core. Newt thinks he\u0027s a liar. That was then.Read Post | Comments (38)Gene Marks, 10/07/12Small business management columnist, author, speaker, and business ownerWe all work as hard as those guys last century.
