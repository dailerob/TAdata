{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Given the way Mitt Romney gushed when he introduced Paul Ryan as his VP pick, you\u0027d think he\u0027d not just found his running mate, but his soul mate as well. Romney praised Ryan for his \"leadership,\" his \"values,\" his \"steadiness,\" and his \"firm principles.\" But then, right after Ryan was picked, the Romney campaign immediately made sure that Ryan abandoned each one of those qualities. In other words, you fall in love with that special someone for his independence and fiery spirit -- and then right after the honeymoon, you try to turn him into a doormat.

Green, 08/23/12Executive Producer, HuffPost LiveTwo questions are raised in all of the varied responses to Todd Akin by those on the Republican side of the aisle, and it is a failing of the media that we haven\u0027t heard more about two aspects of this tempest.Read Post | CommentsAlan Zweibel, 08/23/12Comedy WriterThe ad agency for a commercial I\u0027m reading for described my character as a funny old Jew.
