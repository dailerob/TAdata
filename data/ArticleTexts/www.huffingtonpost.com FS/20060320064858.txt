{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"APFrom ehsd.k12.nj.usFrom members.outpost10f.comTomorrow will mark the third anniversary of the invasion of Iraq -- clearly no cause for celebration. This week gave us the launch of Operation Swarmer, the latest of over a hundred operations that have failed to bring the insurgency even close to its \"last throes\". Instead, George Bush\u0027s 36-month imperial adventure has produced the following tragic totals: American Military Casualties: 2,317. American Wounded: 17,004. Iraqi Civilian Casualties: 37,795 (estimated). Total Cost of the War: $320 billion. Number of WMD Found: 0. Number of Administration Officials Held Accountable for Iraq Debacle: 0.
