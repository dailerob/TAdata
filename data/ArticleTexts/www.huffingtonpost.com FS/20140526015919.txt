{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Arianna HuffingtonThis week, President Obama met with VA Secretary Eric Shinseki over reports of treatment delays. \"If these allegations prove to be true, it is dishonorable, it is disgraceful and I will not tolerate it,\" said Obama after the meeting. We should absolutely hold accountable those responsible for the recent suffering and deaths of America\u0027s veterans. But let\u0027s not stop with the VA. One reason the system is so overwhelmed is because of the tens of thousands injured in Iraq, an unnecessary war, which also claimed over 4,400 soldiers\u0027 lives. In 2003, Shinseki, then serving as Army chief of staff, testified it would take \"several hundred thousand soldiers\" to occupy Iraq. For speaking the truth about the recklessness and hubris behind the invasion, he was pushed aside by Bush, Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz. So yes, there should be a price to pay for the unnecessary deaths of U.S. veterans -- but when will there be a price to pay for all those who were killed or are still suffering because of an unnecessary and immoral war?Love your self, love your work, love the people around you. Dare to love those who are different from you, no matter where they\u0027re from, what they look like, and who they love. Pursue this life of love with focus and passion and ambition and courage. Give it your all. And that will be your path to true success.John LegendRecording artist, concert performer and philanthropistArthur Gelb was a master builder, the Robert Moses of newspapering. His eyes danced when he told stories about dreaming up the multi-sectioned New York Times.Jill AbramsonExecutive Editor of the New York Times from 2011-2014The existence of judicial review matters only when the courts hold a law unconstitutional. A central question in evaluating this element of our constitutional structure is whether courts have exercised this authority wisely.Geoffrey R. StoneEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of ChicagoOur need to redefine success is as urgent on the collective level as it is in our personal lives. Limiting our metrics of success to money and power and completely defining ourselves by our jobs creates a political class obsessed with short-term gain -- one that\u0027s not up to the types of long-term challenges we\u0027re now facing.Arianna HuffingtonThe wrong question is being asked. It is not, can faith exist with science? It is rather, can enchantment be restored in the age of enlightenment?Gary HartUnited States Senator (Ret.)My extended family, all naturalized American citizens, are among the 17 million people in the U.S. living in mixed-status immigrant households where at least one person is undocumented.

As a matter of civil rights and basic justice, our criminal justice system must change.Rep. John ConyersDean, Congressional Black CaucusFeminist activists are painting Marianne as though she were some conservative like Phyllis Schlafly. Marianne has never uttered a word -- privately or publicly -- against Roe vs. Wade. Marianne supports it 100%.Frances FisherActressRecently, a somewhat obscure scientific journal rejected a paper. Somehow, that made the front page of the London Times and spawned a number of articles in the right-wing press. How in the world does a rejected manuscript warrant front-page media coverage? Here\u0027s how.Michael E. MannDirector of Penn State Earth System Science Center; Author of \u0027Dire Predictions\u0027 and \u0027The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars\u0027Ta-Nehisi Coates, a senior editor at The Atlantic magazine, thinks it\u0027s time for a bold step to change the way we talk and think about race in America.

Fortunately for Amy, she excelled in high school and was accepted at the University of Nebraska, and because she was attending college was eligible for housing, health care, and financial assistance until age 21 through Nebraska\u0027s Former Ward Program. Amy knows very well she was one of the lucky ones.Marian Wright EdelmanPresident, Children\u0027s Defense FundYesterday, Republican Speaker John Boehner admitted that \"there\u0027s not that big a difference\" between the Tea Party and the GOP. The results of last night\u0027s primaries are just the latest confirmation that this is true. The civil war in the Republican Party is over and the Tea Party has won.Rep. Debbie Wasserman SchultzAuthor, \u0027For the Next Generation\u0027; Chair, Democratic National CommitteeThe major news of the announcement was the shock exclusion of Landon Donovan, the team\u0027s all-time leader in goals and assists.
