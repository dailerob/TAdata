It amounts to an assertion of command: the very thing that was aborted by the general\u0027s comments and the vulgar contempt for civilian authority he countenanced and seems to have fomented among his staff.

Haass, 06.23.2010President, Council on Foreign RelationsThe president was wise to act swiftly to replace his theater commander; he should act no less decisively in reviewing the policy.

Borosage, 06.23.2010President of the Institute for America’s FutureAs we remain mired in two costly and endless wars, and emerge from the Great Recession, the timorous have taken control.

Sheldon Whitehouse and Sen. Sherrod Brown, 06.23.2010We should allow our top national law officer, the Attorney General of the United States, to step in and clean house whenever an agency or element of government is no longer credibly independent of the industry it is intended to regulate.Read Post | CommentsRep. Alan Grayson, 06.23.2010U.S. Congressman from Florida\u0027s 8th DistrictI called for McChrystal to go in October, 2009. I called for him to go yesterday. And now, he\u0027s gone. But this isn\u0027t about McChrystal\u0027s job. It\u0027s about McChrystal\u0027s plan -- the plan for endless war. The question is whether America is turning away from war. And we are. Slowly.Read Post | CommentsTony Blankley, 06.23.2010Syndicated columnistWhether intentional or accidental, President Obama\u0027s increasing isolationism will create a world no longer guided by a powerful, benign hand, but rather a world that is the target of malignant grabbing hands and pounding fists.Read Post | CommentsEmma Ruby-Sachs, 06.23.2010AttorneyI hope the Obama administration\u0027s appeal on the Court\u0027s overturned drilling moratorium is in front of a judge without ties to the oil industry who understands how to interpret the law accurately and fairly.Read Post | CommentsDouglas LaBier, 06.23.2010Director, Center for Progressive DevelopmentIf you\u0027re contemplating an affair or in the midst of one, consider the following: Some affairs are psychologically healthy.
