{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"If you haven\u0027t read Anne-Marie Slaughter\u0027s cover story in the July/August issue of The Atlantic, titled \"Why Women Still Can\u0027t Have It All,\" you\u0027ve probably seen part of the discussion it sparked. I was grateful that her article put the spotlight on an issue with deep implications not only for women, but for everyone: that by sacrificing our families -- and by extension, ourselves -- on the altar of our careers, we are in danger of cutting ourselves off from our own wisdom and perspective. Which is to say, the very qualities that are so lacking in our macho work culture.

As of today, 47 million women will have access to the preventive services they need.Read Post | Comments (68)Jay Parini, 08/01/12Author, Literary Executor For Gore VidalFor me, it\u0027s hard to imagine the world without Gore Vidal.Read Post | Comments (23)Esther Lofgren, 08/01/12Olympic Rower, Team USAThe last four years have been a fight to be the best rower I can be, to push myself past what others and what I thought my limits were. Tomorrow, I\u0027ll line up against five other crews in the Olympic final for the opportunity to win a gold medal.Read Post | CommentsSusan Blumenthal, M.D., 08/01/12Public Health Editor at HuffPost and Former U.S. Assistant Surgeon GeneralAdvertising of unhealthy foods using the image of the Olympic Games pairs poor nutrition with an active lifestyle in the eyes of the consumer. For today\u0027s youth, this is a misleading message that the international community can ill-afford to convey.Read Post | CommentsArianna Huffington, 07/31/12I\u0027m delighted to announce the launch of HuffPost Canada Impact. As we continue to expand internationally, and as our ability to connect and engage with others becomes less and less constrained by borders, we believe Impact has tremendous potential to help us all widen the circle of our caring.Read Post | Comments (28)Allison Berkowitz, 08/01/12Social WorkerThere were all too many days while looking at myself in the mirror, I wished I could literally rip the fat from my body. But I believe these feelings -- and most others that might arise -- are totally normal and have to be cleansed like the weight itself.Read Post | Comments (31)Kevin A. Hansen, 08/01/12Author of the bestselling Secret Regrets book; founder of SecretRegrets.comI asked athletic fans of my www.SecretRegrets.com project (where people anonymously confess the biggest regrets of their lives) to share the biggest regret of their athletic career -- the one regret that sidelined them and dashed their dreams of achieving athletic greatness.Read Post | CommentsErica Berman, 08/01/12PhDShould these individuals, desperate for a child, and without other options, not proceed with what is often the most accessible and affordable means of getting a donated egg because their hypothetical child may want to know the identity of his or her biological mother?Read Post | CommentsJanet Tavakoli, 08/01/12President, Tavakoli Structured FinanceDespite widespread crime of various types across all classes of society, most Americans polled were comfortable trusting their own \"moral compass.\" Let\u0027s see how we did with that in July.Read Post | Comments (21)Sen. Harry Reid, 08/01/12Senate Majority LeaderAsking American women to continue denying themselves the care they need is unacceptable. Only by focusing on America\u0027s best interest, rather than our own political interests, will we have a stronger, healthier future together.Read Post | Comments (852)Matthew Appelbaum, 08/01/12Mayor of BoulderBoulder\u0027s focus on the total package is working because we\u0027re not just a job, or just a nice place to live.

Scheer, 08/01/12Managing Editor, TruthDig.comI don\u0027t feel sad for Gore Vidal today. He lived to 86 and he had the kind of life people ask Santa Claus for. It was not without hardship, loss or suffering, but he leaves behind great works and a million smiles. If anything, I feel sad for my country, which lost one of its truest patriots.Read Post | CommentsJoey Durel, 08/01/12Mayor of Lafayette, LouisianaAs a mayor, I am fortunate to live in a very forward thinking community. I strongly believe that as state and federal governments grow and become less manageable, people need to look to local government for real solutions and real answers.Read Post | CommentsB.J.
