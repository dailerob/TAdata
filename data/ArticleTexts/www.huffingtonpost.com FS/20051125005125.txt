{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Happy Thanksgiving. Whether you are cooking up a storm, about to sit down to your feast or basking in a post-turkey tryptophan buzz, our HuffPost bloggers are serving up a cornucopia of tasty takes on the holiday -- from Thanksgiving memories to favorite recipes to reflections on what they are thankful for this year. As for me, right now I am most grateful for my two feisty teenage daughters, my beautiful new cyber-home here in the blogosphere, and all the great friends on our team and beyond it who’ve helped make our first 6 + months such a great ride. Now pull up a chair and dig into our Thanksgiving Roundup -- there’s not a turkey in the bunch.READ POST | comments (30)11.24.2005 Paul Reiser\"Let us always give thanks for all that makes our lives better.\" Today: Al Franken. Next week: Particularly Good Soups, The Smooth Flat Part On The Top of Most Dogs\u0027 Heads, and Dick Van Dyke.READ POST | comments (19)11.24.2005 John CusackI was always humbled by Joe Strummer\u0027s grace and intelligence, his passion, and the sheer ferocity of his will. And Jesus Christ that man could fucking rock.READ POST | comments (33)11.24.2005 Adam McKayI am thankful for the random Chinese building attendant or janitor who locked that door the President tried to open while escaping his press conference in Beijing the other day -- it provided us with an \"uber-metaphoric\" moment for this White House.READ POST | comments11.24.2005 David MametREAD POST | comments (15)11.23.2005 Nora EphronI have a fairly serious theory about Thanksgiving dinner, and it\u0027s this: don\u0027t mess with it. What most people make for Thanksgiving dinner is what their mothers made, and you stray from this at your peril.READ POST | comments (47)11.24.2005 Greg GutfeldThank you, Pesticides! If fruits and vegetables were people, we would call what insects do to them \"rape.\" Pesticides are nature\u0027s \"rape whistles.\" Conclusion: People who hate pesticides are probably rapists.READ POST | comments (18)11.24.2005 David Corn\"Do scientists know if there is a God and if God created the world?\" my six-year-old asked. No, I answered. \"Then it\u0027s only an opinion,\" she said. I was very thankful for that.READ POST | comments11.24.2005 Jeremy PikserI’m thankful my home, my water supply and my electricity have not been blown to shit by US bombs.READ POST | comments11.24.2005 Seth GreenlandI am thankful that, as a union member, when I get sick I don’t have to rob a bank to pay for the treatment I receive. RedGirl: Move to Canada, Seth! You and Michael Moore can share an igloo.READ POST | comments11.24.2005 GawkerAnderson Cooper -- those baby blue eyes make the bad news taste silky smooth.READ POST | comments11.24.2005 Trey EllisThanksgiving, 1974.
