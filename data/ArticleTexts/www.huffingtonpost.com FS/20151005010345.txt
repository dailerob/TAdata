{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"This week, the nation was once again shocked by the everyday, as a gunman killed nine at a community college in Oregon. It\u0027s the uniquely American gun paradox: how something so horrifying can be so routine. As a somber -- bordering on disgusted -- President Obama noted: \"we\u0027ve become numb to this.\" In truth, this actually isn\u0027t everyday violence -- it\u0027s more than everyday. In the 274 days of 2015, we\u0027ve had 294 mass shootings. And 986 since Sandy Hook in 2012. The question is, when will our level of disgust be high enough that we do what\u0027s needed to lower the body count? \"If you think this is a problem,\" said the president, \"then you should expect your elected officials to reflect your views.\" Until that happens, he said, we all bear a share of the blame: \"We collectively are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction.\" Will we rise to the challenge?After a two-year absence from the international stage -- during which the mainstream media dispatched them to the realm of nonexistent entities -- on October 1 the \"moderate rebels\" of Syria were back. The New York Times said so. Russian attacks were targeting moderates rather than ISIS, a man with a camera was quoted saying; and the Times story by Anne Barnard appeared to confirm his suspicion; even as a companion report on Russian actions in Syria by Helene Cooper, Michael R. Gordon, and Neil MacFarquhar revealed that these are the same moderates who were carefully vetted by the CIA, and concerning whom little was heard ever after. Their numbers are put at 3,000 to 5,000, though the Cooper-Gordon-MacFarquhar article leaves uncertain if that is their original or their present strength.Professor of Literature, Yale UniversityWe know exactly what Planned Parenthood does for millions of people in this country, and we will not let those committed to ending abortion access use fraud and deception to cut millions of people off from high-quality preventive care.President of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Planned Parenthood Action Fund and Planned Parenthood VotesUntil politicians in the US are prepared to risk their own political scalp, stand up to the powerful gun lobby and even anger their own voting base to limit the general public\u0027s access to certain types of weapons, America will continue to drown in gun blood.Writer and Director of Public Affairs at the NSW Minerals CouncilWe all know that I haven\u0027t gotten justice, but that doesn\u0027t mean that I\u0027m not going to keep fighting for it. This struggle is much larger than me. We have seen our voting rights stripped right along with our humanity. And it is time that we join together to say, \"Enough is enough. We want justice -- or else!\"Founder of Garner Way Foundation and daughter of Eric GarnerPolitical Director for Garner Way FoundationThe pope, according to the Vatican\u0027s clarification, knew little of the particulars of her story. It appears it was not a private meeting to endorse her. A Vatican spokesman even described it as not \"a real audience\" -- quite an insult to Davis -- unlike some of the pope\u0027s other meetings.Gay Voices Editor-at-Large, The Huffington PostThe Supreme Court speaks not only through its rulings in cases argued before it, but also through its choice not to hear certain cases -- the ones denied certiorari, in legal lingo. By refusing to hear claims brought by victims of Bush-era torture and detention practices, and failing to decisively reject the government\u0027s array of bad excuses for denying them a modicum of justice, the Court in recent years has sent an appalling message of indifference and impunity.Senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of LawRecently released data from the U.S. Census Bureau\u0027s Current Population Survey show the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is working and helping get people health coverage. This is a welcome stark contrast to new census data showing children remain our poorest age group and the younger they are the poorer they are.President, Children\u0027s Defense FundIt feels as though there is a gaping hole in our nation\u0027s soul. It is time we take a serious look at the epidemic of violence in America, and begin to implement real solutions; they are out there.Executive Vice President, Peace AllianceHearing the gospel preached every day with such eloquence and power -- while seeing it lived with such authenticity and integrity -- showed me how far I fall short of the things I most dearly and deeply believe.Christian leader for social change; President and Founder @SojournersIt is strange to watch the Republican Presidential debates or hear the candidates describe our country. While there is hype in political rhetoric, now there are outright falsehoods being peddled as facts.Singer; Actress; Director; Composer; ActivistIt is time to finally achieve the independence of the State of Palestine, peacefully resolving the Palestinian-Israeli conflict -- the core of the Arab-Israeli conflict -- as was promised long ago.Palestinian Authority PresidentSince my GOP friends don\u0027t seem to understand how an OB-GYN appointment actually works, let me explain: Planned Parenthood and other primary care providers offer life-saving breast cancer screenings.Senior Member of the Senate Foreign Relations CommitteeTimes are hard in today\u0027s Russia. At some point, Russians will expect their powerful leader to deliver better times at home. To delay that day of judgment a little longer, Putin needs victories -- particularly those that burnish Russia\u0027s image as a world power. Once again, he\u0027s getting them. For now, he\u0027s on a roll -- and an international force to be reckoned with.President, Eurasia Group; Author, \u0027Superpower: Three Choices for America’s Role in the World\u0027A presidential poll released as Speaker Boehner made his announcement shows Republicans want something no Republican candidate is talking about.CEO of MAYDAY.US, Associate Law Professor at Fordham, Corruption ScholarWe have little time to argue over the man or one individual, when our people are dying every day, at the hands of our system or at the hands of each other.Founder, GlobalGrind.comThe evidence is clear that managing for safety results in more productive, successful businesses. There are serious financial consequences for businesses that don\u0027t acknowledge the importance of worker safety. They not only endanger their own workers, they reduce their competitiveness and harm their bottom line.Administrator, U.S.Environmental Protection AgencyU.S. Secretary of LaborThe nation\u0027s payrolls rose by only 142,000 last month, and job gains for July and August were revised down by 59,000, suggesting the pace of job growth has slowed in recent months. Analysts were expecting job growth of around 200,000, and the question is how much should it change our views about underlying labor market conditions?Fmr. Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributorHow bad would things have to get for you to spend all of your money so your family could cram into a flimsy, rubber boat with 40 other people? How bad would things have to get before you actually felt lucky to get a spot on that boat?Actor and ProducerCalifornia is rightly regarded as a progressive beacon. But in this reliably blue, profoundly innovative state, we have witnessed the growth of a massive, inhumane and costly incarceration system. Worst still, people of color bear the brunt of this broken system.President, Dream Corps Unlimited; Author of NY Times bestseller, \u0027The Green-Collar Economy\u0027If one says the word \"miscarriage\" out loud, does that feed its evil powers? Do we fear that communing over this type of loss only makes it grow stronger?Tony Award-winning actressIt has happened again. Mass shootings like the one today at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg happen too often and Oregon has not been immune. Today we offer our prayers for those killed and injured. Still, we must also work to take steps that reduce gun violence this day so that there are no more days like this.Director of the Center for Peace and Spirituality and University Chaplain at Pacific UniversityWhen I was entering my sophomore year, I piled up my schedule with everything there was. Not only was I taking a heavy course load, I was also in two shows, and trying to work outside of school. In addition, within the first couple of weeks, one of my good friends went through a major life trauma. I wanted to be there for her as much as possible.ActressIf you\u0027ve been entrusted with raising children in a society that is measurably not as safe as it should be, why wouldn\u0027t you want to seek ways to make it a better place? I\u0027m not telling my child, the most precious gem of my universe, that there is nothing to be done and that I won\u0027t even try. You shouldn\u0027t either.Playwright and Author, \u0027Homo Domesticus: Notes from a Same-Sex Marriage\u0027It\u0027s the deal you make having pets - you know they don\u0027t live for very long and you will be devastated when you lose them. But the fun, love, companionship and joy they bring is worth the pain at the end and the massive hole they invariably leave. It\u0027s a privilege that pets choose to share their lives with us.Blogs Editor of The Huffington Post UKThe Washington Post just ran an attack on Bernie Sanders that distorts not only what he\u0027s saying and seeking but also the basic choices that lie before the nation.Chancellor\u0027s Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, \u0027Beyond Outrage\u0027My mind doesn\u0027t understand that I\u0027m 52-years-old. It still feels 31. My body, however, is fully aware of the number of years it\u0027s lived. There are things I\u0027m too old for. Here are eight of them.Blogger, mother, wife, drinker of tequilaAfter spending over 20 years at Microsoft, in key leadership positions, Robbie Bach takes the lessons learned from building successful operations and applying them to the broader civic, and social issues we must deal with to fix our nation, our institutions and ourselves.Host and Producer of Between the Lines with Barry Kibrick seen on PBS.A lot of gun owners will tell you that the solution to the number of mass shootings in this country is not any regulation of guns or gun ownership. If I accepted that there should be no regulations on gun ownership but still wanted to reduce the number of gun deaths, what would be required?Climber, Skier, Sometimes Surfer, Director of Sierra Club Outdoors, OIF VeteranI hugged the young woman and told her to keep up the fight and let her light shine, and promised her that I would make sure that it did.
