{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"Director of Policy Analysis and Research, Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids; former Vice President, Brady Center to Prevent Gun ViolenceThe American people can overcome the gun lobby, but only if we confront, and expose, three myths that have long dominated the gun debate and given the politicians a ready excuse for inaction. First, we must not let the opponents of reform get away with the empty bromide that \"guns don\u0027t kill people, people kill people.\" Second, we must challenge the idea that no law can prevent violent people from getting guns. Third, we must not accept the notion that our Constitution condemns us to the continued slaughter of our children. The tobacco control movement overcame some equally powerful mythology to fundamentally alter American attitudes toward tobacco products. Once these myths were exposed, attitudes changed, policies changed and we started saving countless lives. Similarly fundamental change can come to the gun issue as well.Read Post | Comments (40)Geoffrey R. Stone, 12/19/12Edward H.
