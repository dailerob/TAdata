The U.S. looks in the mirror and what do we see? Russia.Read Post | Comments (32)BIOHarry Shearer, 08.21.2008For those who keep asking a variant of \"why, with all the federal billions sent down there, is New Orlean\u0027s recovery so slow?\", an authoritative answer is now available.Read Post | CommentsBIOBrandon Friedman, 08.21.2008McCain justified not knowing how many houses he has by saying he was a POW in Vietnam, four decades ago. I have some things to say about this.Read Post | Comments (81)BIODavid Perel, 08.21.2008The Edwards story is a watershed moment; the point when mainstream media\u0027s relevancy developed irreparable cracks, when an army of bloggers overran the stodgy elitist guard.Read Post | Comments (53)BIOJohn Zogby, 08.21.2008As much as voters may prefer the Democrats on most issues, McCain is winning the contest of defining who has the character and personality that swing voters expect in a president.Read Post | Comments (219)BIORJ Eskow, 08.21.2008Hey, John McCain can\u0027t remember how many houses he has! It\u0027s not his fault, though. He had the number written down but he left it in his other plane.Read Post | Comments (48)BIOMitchell Bard, 08.21.2008There has been an amazing confluence of events, and If McCain survives the last 24 hours, I\u0027m not sure what it will take to stop him.Read Post | Comments (141)BIOZachary Karabell, 08.21.2008The huge variability between different states makes it very hard for any candidate to run on a coherent economic platform that has national appeal.Read Post | CommentsBIOAJ Rossmiller, 08.21.2008When pundits make hyperventilating claims about Obama\u0027s alleged campaign appeasement, it is vital to note that Obama has played this game before. Those who are calling for an all-out assault against McCain have short memories.Read Post | Comments (172)BIOCristina Page, 08.21.2008\"Pro-life\" campaigns against birth control are based not on scientific evidence, but rather on wishful thinking. If the science isn\u0027t on your side, then, the \"pro-life\" side seems to believe, ignore it.Read Post | Comments (75)BIOAdele Stan, 08.20.2008I so hate to bust up this party, but do listen up: It ain\u0027t gonna happen. No way, no how. McCain is borrowing a technique from a guy named George W. Bush.Read Post | Comments (149)Susan Isaacs, 08.21.2008Moby, 08.21.2008Huff TV, 08.21.2008Paul Slansky, 08.21.2008Sen.
