{"htmlTagMap":{"p":"AP/LM Otero08.12.2005 Arianna HuffingtonThe right wing attacks on Cindy Sheehan -- desperate, pathetic, and grasping at straws -- expose much less about their target than about the attackers. I mean, trying to slime a grieving Gold Star mom because she is inconveniently questioning the reasons her son was sent off to die in Iraq? Why that would be like trashing a much-decorated war hero or outing an undercover CIA agent… Oh, right. How much longer can the Bushies get away with mauling the very values they profess to stand for before their supporters start getting wise to the fact that the only value they really value is power?After the Cindy as Flip-Flopper story was revealed as a very poorly done hatchet job, a second load of sludge was quickly dumped: the ludicrous statement from the (ahem) “Sheehan Family” condemning Cindy’s “political motivations and publicity tactics”. Where do I start with this piece of manufactured offal? The only name attached to the “Sheehan Family” statement belongs to Cherie Quartarolo who describes herself as Casey’s aunt and godmother. So did I miss something? Since when does godmother outrank mother? What I really want to know is: how does Casey’s second-cousin-twice-removed feel about Cindy’s vigil? How about his ex-brother-in-law’s cleaning lady?read whole post | permalink | comments08.13.2005 Cindy SheehanWe are here at the Crawford Peace House now. I came here so angry and I have been so encouraged and overwhelmed by the support from all over. I was thinking that there is no reason for us progressive liberals to be angry anymore. We have the power. One mom has shown that ordinary citizens can make a difference. We the people have to hold George Bush accountable. We have to make sure he answers to us. If he doesn\u0027t have to answer to Congress, or the media, we will force him to answer to us.read whole post | permalink | comments08.12.2005 Lt. Gen. Claudia KennedyGenerally speaking, one of the most private groups of people in public service are general officers in the US Army. This is not a preference that comes with the stars, rather it is developed over decades of service to America in the Army. As officers become more senior, their privacy becomes more treasured and more fragile. So with this in mind, I would guess that this must be a very painful time for General Kevin Byrnes. I do not know anything about the circumstances of the recent announcement about his \"personal conduct.\" A banner on one of the cable TV news stations is my only \"source\" that something is amiss. But I do know Kevin Byrnes as a fellow officer.read whole post | permalink | comments08.12.2005 Nicholas von HoffmanWhite House sources report that while Karl Rove is irked at Cindy Sheehan, the Gold Star mom, he is telling GOP operatives to thank their lucky stars the woman is not demanding to talk to President Bush about the price of gasoline. In addition to the Sheehan Texas camp-out, the big problem confronting Mr. Bush is the countdown to the 2,000th American death in Iraq. Bush strategists cannot decide if his best move is to hide the 2,000th body at Dover Air Force Base and make like it’s business as usual or apply the wisdom of Stalin and make public new figures revealing hundreds of thousands of other deaths, even if they are Iraqi.read whole post | permalink | comments08.12.2005 Rep. Bernie SandersThe President should hear firsthand from a woman whose views reflect those of tens of millions of Americans who believe that we have got to begin bringing our troops home as soon as possible. The President owes Ms. Sheehan and other families that lost loved ones in Iraq more than platitudes. He owes them and the American public an explanation about his plans for an exit strategy.read whole post | permalink | comments08.12.2005 Steve CobbleC\u0027mon, Arnold, Cindy Sheehan\u0027s from California. Why are you being so shy? Why haven\u0027t you picked up the phone and called your buddy, George? Why don\u0027t you tell him that\u0027s one of your constituents out there in the hot sun, and her son was one of almost 200 of your constituents that have died in Iraq so far, and you think it\u0027s only fair that Cindy -- and everyone in your state -- should get some answers? Why so quiet and meek? You\u0027re always playing a tough guy in the movies, and George always talks about being \"resolute\"; but suddenly you\u0027re so shy, and he\u0027s in hiding... Is Conan afraid to call Custer?read whole post | permalink | comments08.12.2005 James MooreIn every standoff there comes a time when the tide will turn in one direction. In our culture, these moments are palpable because a complicated question has been rendered into a simple confrontation between the just and the unjust, the big guy and the little guy, the powerful and the weak. And we all know who Americans choose in those kinds of fights. Cindy Sheehan, with her soft voice and steely determination, has given us a simple choice. We can stand with a mother who doesn\u0027t want other mothers to suffer the way she is suffering; or we can side with a president who offers us platitudes instead of exit strategies and unfounded optimism instead of honest logic. I\u0027m on Cindy\u0027s side.read whole post | permalink | comments08.12.2005 Timothy NaftaliCindy Sheehan\u0027s courageous personal demonstration is a source of shame: not directed at her, of course, but at the fact that the people elected to demand better from the White House are too busy, afraid or \"loyal\" to ask why one should stay a course that is not smart. This need not be an argument for immediate withdrawal, by the way. But what is needed is a better explanation for what we are doing in Iraq today besides making it easier for suicide bombers to kill the sons of other Cindy Sheehans.read whole post | permalink | comments08.12.2005 Rep. George MillerGiven the enormous loss Cindy has suffered, a meeting is not too much to ask. These soldiers’ families -- and all Americans -- are owed a real explanation, not just talking points, about how the Administration got everything so tragically wrong. By seeking answers to these questions, Cindy is simply doing the job that Congress should have already begun, but has failed to. Our nation owes Cindy Sheehan a debt of gratitude for her efforts to uncover the truth.read whole post | permalink | comments08.12.2005 Robert GreenwaldCindy and the other members of military families, many of whom have had their children, husbands, wives, brothers and sisters killed, have taken their pain and grief, and focused it on the cause: the Bush administration and its policies. I have had the great honor of working with these folks over the last two years and they are the most inspiring people I know. Let us all support them however we can. The loss of their family members will never be forgotten or healed, but we can put our hearts, souls and bodies into the fight to end this insanity.read whole post | permalink | comments08.12.2005 Chuck GutensonTo extend their quest for power and wealth, the administration was willing to sacrifice the meager wealth of others (to fund the war) and in too many cases to sacrifice the children of others. Like the mother who recently claimed that, though she supports the war, \"military service isn\u0027t for our son. It isn\u0027t for our kind of people,\" this administration simply does not see a problem with sending troops to be killed and maimed while judging that such sacrifice is \"not for their kind of people.\" Overwhelmingly, they did not serve; overwhelmingly, their children do not serve.read whole post | permalink | comments08.12.2005 Robert SchlesingerJohn Roberts should be glad he\u0027s not a member of the press. The future Supreme Court nominee worked -- pro-bono -- to help gay rights activists. Yet social conservatives brush off this particular bit of judicial bonhommie as Roberts simply doing his job. So one is forced to wonder what sort of superman is this John Roberts that he possesses these extraordinary powers of self-discipline of being able to put aside his personal feelings -- block out his own biases as it were -- when working on hot-button issues. He must be a superman because, judging from what conservatives say about the media, one would think that the ability to work around one\u0027s own prejudices when doing a job is rare indeed if not wholly unknown.read whole post | permalink | comments08.12.2005 Dr. Ralph DittmanIf, in fact, stem cell dedifferentiation really worked, it would be the mana we all crave. As is, it\u0027s just another ingredient in the morass being concocted by Chef Senator Doctor Frist, President \"Do-I-allow-the-destruction-of-life-in-order-to-advance-science\" Bush, and the always well-intentioned, right wing minority to feed the uninformed American public. Banning SCNT would be a scientific disaster. It would be like asking an artist to paint a canvas without using his/her brushes. Yes, it could be done...but what a mess.read whole post | permalink | comments08.12.2005 Walter ShapiroThe moment that Hadley -- the top geopolitical advisor to the Most Powerful Man on This Planet -- spent 45 minutes with Sheehan, it became impossible to credibly dismiss her as a publicity-seeking nutcase rendered irrational by grief. The president\u0027s national security advisor is far too important to waste nearly an hour on missions of mercy to looney-tunes protesters. Do you think the foreign minister of Latvia would get 45 minutes with Hadley, even if he flew unannounced to Crawford?read whole post | permalink | comments08.12.2005 Greg GutfeldNo one sent me the email about it being ALL-CINDY FRIDAY, and now I feel like a wallflower at an orgy. A BIG FAT HAIRY WALLFLOWER. It\u0027s like showing up at a costume party, and everyone but me came dressed as a blood-sucking ghoul! But I will give it a shot: GREG\u0027S OBLIGATORY CINDY SHEEHAN POST !read whole post | permalink | comments08.12.2005 Ari BermanThe prominence of Democratic party leaders like Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton who support the US occupation of Iraq presents the Democrats with an odd dilemma. At a time when the American people are turning against the Iraq War and favor a withdrawal of US troops, why are the leading Democratic presidential candidates for \u002708 unapologetic war hawks? It\u0027s more than a little ironic that the people who got Iraq so wrong continue to tell the Democrats how to get it right.read whole post | permalink | comments08.12.2005 Paul RieckhoffHow many times can we make the same mistake? We went to war without sufficient planning for logistics, supply throughput, or even spare parts availability...apparently, we\u0027ve decided to make the Iraqis go through the same \"character-building\" experience. Now consider DoD\u0027s current plans to outsource much of their logistics support chain to private companies (because it\u0027s more efficient, of course), and it becomes apparent that if the lunatics are not fully in control of the asylum, they\u0027re at least writing the rulebooks...read whole post | permalink | comments08.12.2005 Russ BakerThe Times reports: \"Senior Pentagon officials have opposed the release of photographs and videotapes of the abuse of detainees at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, arguing that they would incite public opinion in the Muslim world and put the lives of American soldiers and officials at risk.\" Well, no kidding. Certainly, these photos might indeed incite adverse reaction abroad. But they might also incite adverse reaction in places like Topeka, Kansas, and Tupelo, Mississippi. In other words, the fundamentalist base that is so crucial to the administration\u0027s faltering support might not much like these photos either.read whole post | permalink | comments08.12.2005 Alex KeyssarFor those of us of a certain age, it\u0027s hard not to be reminded of the mother\u0027s marches against the Vietnam war in the 1960s; busloads of middle-aged women were alot harder to dismiss (or denigrate) than shaggy haired radical protestors. Those mothers marches made a difference, contributing to the swelling of popular opposition to the war. If there were a military draft now, I suspect that President Bush would be encountering protesting mothers every time he appeared in public. As the war drags on, with no end in sight and more casualties every day, that might end up happening anyway.read whole post | permalink | commentsFrom justicesunday.comFrom GFK.NOP/CNNAP/Lauren ShayAP/Charles DharapakAP/Mark J.
